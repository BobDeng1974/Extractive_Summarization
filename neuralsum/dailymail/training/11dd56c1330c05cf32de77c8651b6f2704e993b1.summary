a @entity2 minister 's attack on a ' wealthy metropolitan elite ' who hire cheap migrant workers backfired today , as it emerged @entity6 and @entity7 both employ foreign staff at home			1
@entity10 refused to defend the prime minister 's decision to hire a nanny for his children from outside the @entity15 , and mr @entity7 revealed he employs a @entity17 woman but would not go into detail of his ' domestic arrangements '			1
the spotlight fell on politicians ' home helps after immigration minister @entity23 used his first major speech to accuse the middle classes of enjoying ' cheap tradesmen and services ' , while the working class were squeezed out of jobs by migrants			1
nanny state : deputy prime minister @entity7 said he employs a @entity17 woman at home but would not give details , while @entity6 has previously hire @entity36 and @entity37 nannies mr @entity23 said better - off families had benefited from cheap builders , tradesmen and nannies from overseas			1
but he claimed add that cheerleaders of uncontrolled immigration who view ' foreign labour as a cheap commodity ' need reminding that it also ' forces wages down and house prices up and put pressure on social cohesion and public services '			2
he claimed that for ' too long ' the well - off had enjoyed the benefits of hiring cheap migrant workers as domestic help , and called for immigration to fall			1
however , in the past mr @entity6 has @entity36 and @entity37 nannies to look after his children in @entity57			1
today the @entity12 's official spokesman refused to comment on whether the @entity6 's still have domestic staff from abroad			1
' i 'm going to keep talking about government policy ' , he said			2
mr @entity7 was also challenged about help at his some in @entity63			1
asked on his @entity65 phone - in where his gardener , nanny and housekeeper are from , the @entity12 replied : ' i ’m not going to get into a great list of who … ' i have a lady who has a @entity17 passport who helps us , but if you do n’t mind i ’m not going to discuss my own domestic arrangements			1
' in his first speech as immigration minister , mr @entity23 also attacked the @entity80 dem business secretary @entity79 for saying a sharp increase in net immigration was ' good news '			1
in a sign of rapidly escalating @entity86 tensions , mr @entity79 will deliver a speech of his own on immigration in @entity63 tonight			1
new immigration minister @entity23 will say in his first speech that better - off families have benefited from cheap builders , tradesmen and nannies from overseas the @entity96 is planning to use a speech tonight to accuse critics of large - scale immigration of wanting to drag @entity100 back to ' medieval ' days			1
he will say he is ' intensely relaxed ' about people bringing skills to @entity100 – and suggests the public would think the same if it was better informed			2
mr @entity23 's speech is part of a concerted @entity2 effort to establish themselves as the party of hard - working @entity100			1
he will told the @entity110 think - tank : ' some have tried to claim that this rapid increase is somehow “ good ” for the country			2
well , just like the home secretary , i disagree			2
' for too long , the benefits of immigration went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour ; or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services – but not to the ordinary , hard - working people of this country			1
we are changing that and building a system that benefits all			0
' the @entity2 minister said the government 's drive to reduce immigration has never been simply an economic one			0
but mr @entity23 will warn that mass immigration has made life harder for ' ordinary , hard - working people ' his speech echoes that of former @entity142 welfare minister @entity141 , who last month called for curbs on benefits for young people to encourage them to fight immigrants for jobs			1
he said the influx of migrants has led to a @entity152 - style culture where rich foreigners hire fellow countrymen for roles once done by young working - class @entity100			2
mr @entity141 – a former poverty adviser to @entity6 – wrote in the @entity157 that the ' unemployment figures contain one particularly disturbing element – the stubbornly high number of young people who are still out of work , 917,000 of them			1
' the awful truth is that huge numbers of unemployed young people either do n't try , or lose out to new arrivals eager to work , ' he claimed			2
business secretary @entity79 insisted critics of immigration were wrong ' a new servant class , equal to that of @entity152 times , has been recreated			0
it 's not upstairs and downstairs any more , though			0
the elite bring the servant class in when they want cleaning done , ironing , gardening , decorating and so on			0
' mr @entity79 , by contrast , will tell business leaders that it would do great harm if the government gave the impression that @entity100 was ' closed for business '			0
he will say : ' bearing down on economic migration is a clear example of a restriction on trade			0
in medieval times , guilds used to prevent travelling artisans from plying their trade outside their native area , with a deadening effect on competition and innovation			0
' what was true then is true now			0
@entity197 down on immigrants , and you lose some of the most dynamic , innovative and imaginative workers in your economy			0
' mr @entity79 has clashed repeatedly with home secretary @entity203 over border controls			2
he has also found himself out of step with public opinion – with eight of ten voters wanting further restrictions on immigration			0
' uncontrolled mass immigration can force wages down and house prices up and put pressure on social cohesion and public services			0
' and let me be clear – it can also cause displacement in the labour market			0
' but , controversially , he will blame ' scare stories ' about migrants shopping for benefits and claim the public are not being asked the right questions by opinion pollsters			0
mr @entity79 will say the issue is ' politically toxic ' and those who put their heads above the parapet need a ' reinforced tin hat '			0
he will then add : ' i do n't think anyone is arguing for unrestricted immigration – in particular of unskilled labour			0
' but we just have to stop treating people coming to work here as if they are a problem			2
we need to kill all the scare stories			0

but warned life is being made harder for ' ordinary , hard - working people '
@entity6 has hired @entity37 and @entity36 nannies for his children
