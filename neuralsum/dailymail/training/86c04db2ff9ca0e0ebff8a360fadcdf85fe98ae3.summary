by @entity0 published : 15:07 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 02:49 est , 24 january 2013 experts estimate that one third of nine to 12 - year - olds in the @entity4 have a @entity6 page despite rules that say only those aged 13 or over can sign up parents are responsible for the rise of young children using @entity6 , an executive from the website warned yesterday			1
@entity13 , policy director for @entity6 in the @entity4 and @entity14 , was joined by @entity15 , professor of social psychology of the @entity17 , in warning that parents were flouting the site ’s age restrictions by either helping their children create accounts or failing to be firm with them and stop them from signing up			1
as a result youngsters who use @entity6 risk being exposed to porn and online grooming			2
the site sets a minimum membership age of 13 , however mr @entity13 admits there is ‘ no mechanism ’ to stop youngsters lying about how old they are			2
professor @entity33 said figures from two years ago show that 34 per cent of nine to 12 - year - olds in the @entity4 had a @entity6 profile , adding it ‘ can only have gone up since then ’			1
she suggested the starting age was reaching school years five to six , or children aged ten to 11			0
speaking at the @entity41 , professor @entity33 , who researches children and internet use , urged parents to be stricter , saying : ‘ if parents say “ no , you ’re too young ” , young children will listen to that … parents should say no. ’ blocked : users must vouch that they are 13 or older to sign up for the website but many children simply lie about their age mr @entity13 , who was at the same event , said : ‘ i am well aware of research which shows there are a lot of 11 , 12 , or even younger children who have @entity6 accounts and lie about their age			1
' the research also shows that , in the great majority , parents not only know about this but actually help their children do this			0
just to be clear , we do n’t condone it			0
’ he admitted preventing under - age children from signing on was a ‘ tricky ’ area : ‘ we have n’t got a mechanism for eradicating the problem			1
’ spot checks and a reporting system are in place in an attempt to protect youngsters , he said			0
he told the @entity41 it can not make every user prove their age as it ' would get privacy advocates up in arms '			0
however , he said the company neither ' condones ' nor ' condemns ' parents but says it is their decision			0
@entity6 rules state that anybody under 13 can not use the website but there is nothing stopping a young child from lying when asked to enter their date of birth			1
mr @entity13 told the event : ' you ca n't make everyone prove their age … that would get privacy advocates up in arms			0
' he added that the under - 13s rule was in place not because @entity6 is ' unsafe ' but because of a @entity106 children 's online privacy law			2
the site does have strict rules about bullying and grooming and mr @entity13 said policing @entity6 would not be given to an external company .			2

@entity6 rules prevent children under 13 from signing up
but a third of nine to 12 - year - olds are *believed* to have a @entity6 profile
experts today said parents should prevent usage by underage children
and @entity6 admitted it can not stop children lying about their age
