@entity1 risks being held to ransom by @entity3 unless @entity4 agrees to implement a system of ‘ @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws ’ at @entity8 , @entity9 said yesterday			1
the leader of the @entity11 said @entity12 was refusing to back a veto for @entity1 @entity14 over legislation that applies only to their constituents , to keep open the possibility of a @entity4 - @entity20 coalition			1
the conservatives said they planned to strip @entity23 mps of the power to impose tax changes , education and health reforms on @entity1 , given the @entity28 will soon have control of all these issues			2
@entity33 @entity9 speaking at @entity34 yesterday , where he proposed that @entity1 mps would have a veto on @entity1 only issues the reform would make it impossible for an incoming @entity4 government to press ahead with its plan to raise the top rate of tax to 50p in @entity1 , for example , without winning the support of a majority of @entity1 mps			1
mr @entity9 said it was a ‘ simple matter of fairness ’			0
but his blueprint prompted a furious response from @entity4 and the @entity20 – as well as some right - wing @entity51 who want to go further and create an effective @entity53			0
former prime minister @entity54 claimed the proposals ‘ put party before country ’ and ‘ risk the very survival of the @entity59 ’			1
he said governments had failed for 150 years to resolve the issue of ‘ @entity1 votes ’ while maintaining the ‘ unity of the @entity59 ’			0
mr @entity54 said the @entity51 plan ‘ means only one thing : restricting the rights of @entity23 mps to vote in the @entity67 , even to the extent of excluding them under legislative consent motions from budget votes on key tax issues			1
‘ and the @entity21 have acted with huge cynicism : it was the conservatives who proposed devolving all @entity23 income tax to the @entity28 , and they have now made this the pretext for giving @entity1 mps the power of veto on the annual budget vote on income tax rates			2
’ former prime minister @entity54 claimed mr @entity9 's proposals ‘ put party before country ’ and ‘ risk the very survival of the @entity59 ’ @entity87 , @entity20 deputy leader and @entity89 spokesman , condemned what he called a ‘ shambolic and confused plan to stop @entity23 mps voting on parts of the entire @entity59 budget ’			1
@entity4 would also be reluctant to embrace a full - blown system of ‘ @entity1 votes ’ because it has traditionally relied on the votes of its @entity23 mps – currently 40 – to get legislation through when in government			1
tuition fees and foundation hospitals were passed into law thanks to votes of @entity4 ’s ‘ tartan army ’ , though neither applies in @entity23			0
polls suggest that since last year ’s independence referendum , however , @entity4 support has collapsed in @entity23 as voters switch to the @entity20 , which is hoping to win 20 or 30 mps in may			1
former @entity51 donor turned pollster lord @entity112 is today due to release the most detailed analysis to date of the @entity20 surge			0
despite the anger of @entity4 and the @entity20 , some conservative mps insisted mr @entity9 had not gone far enough			2
mr @entity9 added @entity12 , pictured , was refusing to back a veto for @entity1 @entity14 over legislation that applies only to their constituents , to keep open the possibility of a @entity4 - @entity20 coalition while he proposes a veto for mps in @entity1 on issues that are decided north of the border by the @entity28 , legislation would still require the ultimate approval of all @entity59 mps to pass			1
former frontbencher @entity130 said : ‘ it has built into it a formula for another constitutional crisis			0
’ @entity135 , a former cabinet minister , welcomed the proposed power for @entity1 mps to block legislation only applying in their constituencies and not @entity23			0
but he said @entity23 @entity146 or @entity147 could still ‘ all gang up and try to block an @entity1 proposal until we cave in on what they wanted ’			0
mr @entity9 said : ‘ the prime minister and i have decided that the option we will put forward to @entity28 and the country will be one that gives an effective veto to @entity1 @entity14 over matters only affecting @entity1 , or @entity1 and @entity154 , while maintaining the integrity of the @entity156			2
‘ we conservatives believe that this principle of @entity1 consent , the @entity1 veto should be extended to taxation when the equivalent decisions have been devolved to @entity23 – and under a conservative @entity165 it will be			0
‘ this is a fundamental matter of fairness			0
how could it possibly be right for the @entity28 for example , to vote for a reduction in @entity172 in @entity23 and then for @entity23 mps to come to @entity8 and be able to impose an increase in @entity172 in @entity1 ? ’ he rejected the argument that reform will weaken the @entity59 , insisting : ‘ i say that failure to act would be the true weakening of the @entity59			2

@entity9 wants to stop @entity23 mps from voting on @entity1 issues
says @entity12 is refusing to back the veto in case he needs @entity20 help
former *pm* @entity54 claimed proposals ‘ put party before country ’
polls suggest @entity4 support is collapsing in @entity23 in *favour* of @entity20
