it is known as the @entity1 , but @entity2 could soon get its own official red light district			1
the mayor of the @entity6 capital , @entity7 , has given his blessing to proposals to designate a specific area for prostitution from april			1
the legislation will allow prostitution in the @entity15 business district south of the city with the aim of reducing the number of streets currently being used for the purpose			1
pope @entity21 has called trafficking in @entity2 a ' shameful plague ' @entity24 , @entity25 prostitution is legal in @entity6 , and women plying their trade are a common sight in certain areas of @entity2 and other cities , but residents have long complained about the visibility of the sex trade			1
the proposal will mean that an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 women selling sex to around 2.5 million customers will be working in a safer environment , officials say			0
the council believes that by creating an official red - light district in what is a largely non-residential area , there will be less chance of trafficking , described by @entity21 recently as a ‘ shameful plague ’			1
residents of @entity2 have long been campaigning for a solution to reduce the visibility of the trade on certain streets , and it is believed the move could help shield children and families from the sex trade			0
@entity59 is currently conducted on more than 20 streets in the @entity15 district of @entity2 a prostitute walks in an alley of the @entity15 district the plans include proposals to provide ‘ psychological support and health care ’ to prostitutes on the designated streets , and clients of prostitutes who work on non-designated streets risk fines of 500 euros ( £ 370 )			2
unsurprisingly , the proposal has been criticised by some @entity76 figures , with the weekly magazine of the @entity78 , @entity79 calling it ‘ shameful ’			1
one councillor went as far as to suggest that the idea will create prostitution ' ghettos '			0
@entity85 of the @entity86 was reported by @entity88 paper @entity87 as saying that with the legislation , @entity2 would be in effect introducing ‘ tolerance zones for the slavery of women			0
’ the paper carried out a survey which found that nine million @entity6 men – more than one in three of the population – had used a prostitute at least once			0
if the experiment proves successful , the council may establish up to three separate red light zones within the district			2
last week pope @entity21 called for more help for ‘ the men , women and children enslaved , exploited , abused as instruments of work or pleasure and often tortured and mutilated ’			0
he urged governments to act decisively to remove the ‘ shameful plague ’ of trafficking which he called unworthy of a civilized society .			2
