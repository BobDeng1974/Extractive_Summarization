go @entity0 ! the a-lister , who swears by a strict vegan lifestyle , has opened up on her @entity10 blog about how pizza , a cigarette at a party , a perfect martini and a daily glass of red wine can make a week more pleasurable , or a night out with friends more fun ' not only is any concept of “ perfection ” untenable ( and maddening ) , but it 's not so enjoyable , either			1
