by @entity0 published : 19:36 est , 6 october 2012 updated : 19:43 est , 6 october 2012 ' aggressive ' : @entity1 , who owned a fleet of ambulances in the @entity4 , was jailed for child porn offences the public is being put at risk by dozens of private ambulance firms because they are not being properly inspected by the health regulator , @entity11 has discovered			1
in one case , the owner of a fleet of ambulances in the @entity4 was allowed to drive vehicles and work as a paramedic – despite having criminal convictions , including ones for kidnapping , assault and downloading child pornography			1
the company , @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , which has contracts with @entity25 trusts and provides emergency support at public events , was given a licence by the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) last november			1
court papers show the @entity29 granted the registration in full knowledge of @entity1 ’s 21 child porn offences , for which he was jailed for two - and - a - half years in 2005			1
but it took the @entity29 until april this year to stop him from working with patients or driving ambulances , even though he was on the sex offenders register and considered a potential risk to children and vulnerable adults			1
and even today the company still has its private ambulance licence			1
the @entity11 has been told by senior sources in the private ambulance industry that dozens of other companies have never been properly inspected , with @entity48 ( @entity48 ) checks on potential criminals not being followed up			1
yesterday , the @entity29 released figures revealing that of the 245 private ambulance companies it has registered , only 54 have been inspected			1
@entity25 trusts spend millions of pounds a year on private firms to make up the shortfall in non-emergency patient transport			2
@entity59 , acting vice-president of the @entity58 , said : ‘ our members have very little faith in the @entity29			2
there are a considerable number of services that look good on paper but should not be trading , and certainly not registered with the @entity29 or any other regulatory body			2
’ the legal papers , from a tribunal hearing this year , show that the reason inspectors failed to discover @entity74 ’s full offending history was that they had relied on his wife , @entity75 , to provide a @entity48 check			0
it was only when @entity78 contacted the @entity29 that inspectors realised the potential risk to the public posed by 60 - year - old @entity74			1
a full police check showed that in 2006 he was cleared by a jury of raping a disabled woman in the back of one of his ambulances			0
@entity74 had denied the charge			0
in july this year , @entity74 challenged the @entity29 ’s decision to stop him working with his ambulance company			1
a social care tribunal in @entity94 agreed to hear his appeal in private , which meant the case could not be reported			0
but in a judgment published in the past few weeks , the tribunal ruled against @entity74 , describing him as aggressive and a potential risk to the public , particularly children			0
' serious concerns ' : an @entity22 spokesman said it had taken steps to remove mr @entity1 ' directorship and stop him from having an operational role in the business a @entity29 spokesman said : ‘ during an inspection in early february 2012 , we identified serious concerns around a number of issues , which resulted in us taking action to prevent mr @entity1 from driving a vehicle in the course of providing the service , and from having any direct contact with people using the service			2
‘ @entity29 is taking action to cancel the registration of @entity22 , meaning the company would no longer be able to provide services			2
however , because this process is subject to a legal challenge , we are not able to comment further at this stage			0
’ mr @entity59 says he knows of other examples where the @entity29 has failed to regulate			2
in one case a private ambulance operator who was a ‘ known suicide risk ’ was approved by the regulator to run a service			1
another private ambulance owner says he knows of a case in which a patient complained that inspectors had failed to check the qualifications of on - board paramedics who had no more than ‘ @entity144 first - aid ’ certificates			1
in other cases , lifesaving equipment on the ambulances , including oxygen tanks and defibrillators , was not properly checked , it is alleged			0
the @entity29 ’s own inspections have also uncovered serious concerns with some of the services they have already registered			2
in one example , a patient complained that a member of the ambulance staff failed to obtain her consent before carrying out a procedure involving the recording of an electrocardiogram ( @entity162 ) in the back of an ambulance			0
the woman objected because the @entity162 was carried out by a young male paramedic and her breasts were exposed			0
the @entity29 said : ‘ we are strengthening internal processes to support inspections of independent ambulance providers by creating regional networks			1
‘ we are at the early stages of a two - year inspection cycle for independent ambulance providers and are on track to complete it			0
we prioritise inspections , inspecting first the services that are suspected of being less safe			0
’ an @entity22 spokesman said it had taken steps to remove mr @entity1 ’s directorship and stop him from having any operational role in the business			0
he said that a new owner would take over mr @entity1 ’s financial interest and mrs @entity74 would remain with the company			0
mrs @entity74 said that she had told the inspectors about all of her husband ’s convictions before @entity22 was registered .			0
