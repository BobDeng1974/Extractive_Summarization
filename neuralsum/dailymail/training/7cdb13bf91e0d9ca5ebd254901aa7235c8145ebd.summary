bird - like plumage have originally evolved in dinosaurs for courtship displays rather than flight , new findings suggest			0
the evidence comes from the first feathered dinosaurs to be discovered in @entity7			1
researchers in @entity9 found evidence of feathers in a juvenile and two adult fossils of ornithomimus , a species within the ornithomimid group			1
plumage : an artist 's impression of the feathered ornithomimid dinosaurs found in @entity20 , @entity9 researchers from the @entity22 , and the @entity23 made the discovery in 75million - year - old rocks in the badlands of southern @entity20			1
ornithomimids were previously thought to have been hairless , fast - running birds , and were depicted as such in the @entity30 dinosaur blockbuster @entity31			1
' the discovery , the first to establish the existence of feathers in ornithomimids , suggests that all ostrich - like dinosaurs had feathers , ' according to a statement from the @entity20 museum			1
@entity41 used its fiercely strong jaw and neck muscles to literally rip the head off triceratops after killing the huge armoured creatures , a new theory claims			0
research into @entity46 fossils from the @entity50 shows that the @entity31 apex predator first slew its prey , then wrenched off its head in order to get to nutrient - rich neck meat hidden by body armour			0
@entity41 was well known to feed on the @entity46 but until now few have questioned how it got around the herbivore 's tough neck frill			0
the study presented last week as the @entity63 's annual meeting , and reported in @entity64 , looked for an answer by examining bite - scarred @entity46 bones			0
the museum said the specimens revealed that the dinosaurs had a base of down - like feathers throughout their lifetime while older ones developed feathers on their arms , approximating wings			2
but the dinosaurs would have been too large to fly , so the plumage might have been employed to attract a mate or in the protection of eggs during hatching			0
the findings by paleontologists @entity84 , curator at the @entity22 , and @entity86 , assistant professor at the @entity23 , will be published on friday in @entity87 , a leading journal			0
' this pattern differs from that seen in birds , where the wings generally develop very young , soon after hatching , ' said dr @entity86 , lead researcher on the study			0
dr @entity84 added : ' the fact that wing - like forelimbs developed in more mature individuals suggests they were used only later in life , perhaps associated with reproductive behaviours like display or egg - brooding			2
' the fossils were discovered in sandstone and were the first feathered dinosaur specimens found in @entity7 , according to the museum statement			1
until now feathered dinosaur skeletons have been found almost exclusively in fine - grained rocks in @entity107 and @entity108			1
75million years old : the skeleton of an ornithomimid dinosaur with preserved evidence of fossil feathers			2
scientists say they are the first dinosaur fossils to show evidence of feathers found in @entity7 ' it was previously thought that feathered dinosaurs could only fossilise in muddy sediment deposited in quiet waters , such as at the bottom of lakes and lagoons , ' said dr @entity84			1
' but the discovery of these ornithomimids in sandstone shows that feathered dinosaurs can also be preserved in rocks deposited by ancient flowing rivers			0
' @entity130 is the type of rock that most commonly preserves dinosaur bones , making it likely that more feathered dinosaurs will be found around the world , said the scientists .			2
