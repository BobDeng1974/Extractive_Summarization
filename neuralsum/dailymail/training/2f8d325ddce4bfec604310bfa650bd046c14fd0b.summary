the @entity1 is planning to make a major foreign visit to @entity3 next year - and bring her three heirs , including toddler @entity6 , with her , it can be revealed			1
the historic family trip is being mooted for next november when the sovereign , who will be 89 , attends the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) for the first time since 2011			1
it would be the first time a monarch and her three heirs - in this case @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity6 - have travelled abroad together			1
the success of the trip led to expectations that @entity18 , who is the longest serving heir apparent in @entity42 history , would represent the @entity1 more regularly at such large - scale events			1
but aides have apparently convinced the @entity1 that the three - hour journey by air to @entity3 is ' just like an internal flight '			1
and the monarch herself has something of a soft spot for the @entity52 where she and prince @entity53 lived for several months during the early days of their marriage			2
speaking during a whirlwind trip to the island by @entity19 yesterday , @entity3 's prime minister dr @entity56 said the @entity1 was ' very keen ' to make it happen			1
dr @entity56 said : ' the invite is out for her majesty to attend and we are waiting for her to reply			2
' i believe her majesty will attend , we are awaiting confirmation			0
' he also revealed : ' i spoke to her in @entity68 at the opening of the @entity70 and she said she was looking forward to coming over			0
' i believe there may be more than one member of the family coming - we 'd like to have all the family here			0
' his wife @entity75 added : ' they are more than welcome			0
it 's a very nice island and very safe			0
' @entity19 also indicated to @entity3 's president that he would love to bring @entity6 and his new brother or sister over			1
prince @entity19 enjoyed the trip around @entity84 's @entity83 on his visit to @entity3 this weekend @entity86 of @entity24 , who is eight weeks pregnant , was forced to pull out of her first solo overseas engagement to @entity3 after suffering from @entity88 , a severe ante - natal sickness @entity3 's president @entity90 said : ' prince @entity91 said he was looking forward to returning to @entity3 and i told his royal highness that we look forward to welcoming all his family including baby @entity6			1
' she formally invited the whole @entity24 family at a spectacular fireworks show to celebrate @entity3 's 50th anniversary of independence from @entity42 on saturday			1
she said : ' permit me to take this opportunity to invite and host all the family of @entity103 , including @entity6 , in the near future			1
' pointing to that address , @entity3 's high commissioner to @entity107 , @entity108 , said they hoped the @entity1 and prince @entity53 would come to @entity11 and that the invitation had been made for @entity111 and the @entity112 to join her			1
' i think her advisers have more or less confirmed to her that it is almost like an internal flight , ' he said			0
he added : ' they will be well taken care of			0
it 's a special place for her -- she has fond memories of being here			0
' and you can see the love and affection for @entity19 and the family			2
it depends if the royal family wants to extend it			0
' prince @entity19 yesterday represented his grandmother at a series of official events on the island after his wife , the @entity134 , was forced to pull out of what would have been her first solo royal tour due to her continuing severe ante - natal sickness			2
as well as attending his first public @entity139 , @entity19 viewed the nation 's two spectacular @entity141 paintings , went on a boat trip around its grand harbour - sailing on the same boat his grandmother did when she stayed on the island in 1949 - and played video games with a group of disadvantaged young children			1
his last engagement of the afternoon , before flew back on a scheduled flight to @entity107 , was a quintessentially @entity153 garden party at the home of the @entity42 high commissioner , @entity156			0
he told ex-pat @entity157 , 71 , that he had spoken to his wife earlier that morning and she was feeling ' a little better			0
' ' but we both agreed that the hot weather would have been too much for her , ' he said			0
@entity3 voluntarily became part of the @entity162 in 1800 but achieved self - rule after the @entity164			2
following a constitutional referendum in 1964 , the island became fully independent , retaining the @entity1 as its @entity167 .			2

the @entity1 plans to bring @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity6 to @entity3
the sovereign , who will be 89 , will be attending a @entity11 meeting
it will be the first time a monarch and three heirs have gone abroad together
