by @entity0 a poignant letter written by a dying woman to her two daughters explaining why she had left half her estate to her toyboy lover was revealed yesterday			1
@entity6 reminded the pair they had previously received ‘ substantial sums ’ and that she had given up an inheritance from her own mother , urging her to leave her estate to them instead			1
she also begged her daughters to ‘ understand and respect my decisions ’ and hailed her younger lover as a ‘ faithful partner ’ who ‘ will need this support ’			1
@entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) argue that her mother was irrational when she changed the will shortly before her death			1
today a letter from their mother was revealed explaining her decision heartbreaking explanation : sisters @entity21 and @entity20 had fought to keep the letter secret , but today it was revealed to the @entity32 it analyst @entity33 , 35 , is fighting @entity34 , 31 , and @entity20 , 32 , for a share of their mother ’s £ 1.2 million farm set in 90 acres in @entity39 , near @entity40 , @entity41			1
mrs @entity6 died aged 53 in february 2010 from a brain tumour , barely a month after creating her will , which left half of her estate to mr @entity33 , with the other half split between her daughters			1
the daughters claim their mother was in a ‘ delusional and irrational ’ state when she signed the will and have asked a judge to tear it up			1
mr @entity33 , from @entity52 , @entity41 , insists he should receive the money			2
he was in his early 20s when he met mrs @entity6 and their relationship ‘ began in earnest ’ over christmas 2005 , the @entity32 in @entity54 was told			1
the couple kept their relationship quiet until mrs @entity6 separated from her husband @entity59 , a property developer now aged 67			1
she was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2009 , apparently cutting her daughters out of their expected inheritance just months later			1
in her letter to her family , explaining her decision to give a huge chunk of her fortune to her lover , mrs @entity6 said she hoped the ‘ division ’ of her estate was ‘ adequate ’ , as ‘ i want you all to be content ’			1
‘ i wanted to provide a benefit that would not only support @entity33 , but one which would then go to help my family , so i hope you all understand and feel that this is reasonable , ’ she wrote			2
‘ i feel i have done my best to provide for @entity76 and @entity77 throughout my life , and that you have both received substantial sums in terms of inheritance over the years , which has given you both a good start to your adult lives			1
i forwent my inheritance from my mother , requesting her to leave it to both [ of ] you instead of taking it myself – so i hope you appreciate that i have tried to do my best for you as i care for you very much			2
‘ your father has not helped throughout the divorce process and sadly decided not to agree to what i feel i should have been entitled to by law , using my low life expectancy against me over the course of the mediation process			0
‘ it was hard for him to come to an agreement , which i feel he should have made more effort to come to under the circumstances , especially given my prognosis			0
‘ as you know i have decided to split my remaining estate between you all , giving 25 per cent to @entity77 , 25 per cent to @entity76 , with @entity33 receiving 50 per cent as he has been my faithful partner for several years and i feel he will need this support			1
’ mrs @entity6 also said she had cut her husband @entity59 out of her will , because of his ‘ obstructiveness ’ in finalising their divorce			2
she went on : ‘ for @entity77 and @entity76 , i feel your father should be able to help you as the divorce settlement looks ultimately to be in his favour and that i have given you the best i could in terms of bringing you up and being a mother			2
i have always tried to give you both the best of everything i have been able to , and i will always love you and your children dearly			0
’ @entity117 and mrs @entity20 claim their mother ‘ failed utterly to engage in the process ’ of making a will and relied on mr @entity33 to help draft it			1
deputy high court judge @entity123 released the letter written by @entity125 , despite her daughters ’ objections			2
the dispute centres on mrs @entity6 ’s mental capacity at the time the will was created			2
@entity130 , as you will know i have left you all a division of my estate			0
i hope you feel that it is adequate given the circumstances as i want you all to be content			0
as you will now know , @entity33 has a lifetime interest in any property that i own , which will then pass on to @entity77 and @entity76			2
i would like to ask that [ daughters ] @entity77 and @entity140 to ensure that this may pass on to @entity143 and @entity144 , so that they may one day benefit from this , as is my intention			0
i wanted to provide a benefit that would not only support @entity33 , but one which would then go to help my family , so i hope you all understand and feel that this is reasonable			2
i feel i have done my best to provide for @entity76 and @entity77 throughout my life , and that you have both received substantial sums in terms of inheritance over the years , which has given you both a good start to your adult lives			1
i forwent my inheritance from my mother , requesting her to leave it to both [ of ] you instead of taking it myself - so i hope you appreciate that i have tried to do my best for you as i care for you very much			0
your father has not helped throughout the divorce process and sadly decided not to agree to what i feel i should have been entitled to by law , using my low life expectancy against me over the course of the mediation process			0
it was hard for him to come to an agreement , which i feel he should have made more effort to come to under the circumstances , especially give my prognosis			0
as you know i have decided to split my remaining estate between you all , giving 25 % to @entity77 , 25 % to @entity76 , with @entity33 receiving 50 % as he has been my faithful partner for several years and i feel he will need this support			1
due to @entity59 ’s obstructiveness in finalising the divorce , we were unsure as to how much money would be left after our pressing expenses and the care i most likely will require throughout my illness			0
i hope there is enough to to help you in some way			0
@entity59 was uninterested in any of the above which saddened me greatly and i only hope he someday realises his unsympathetic view to my situation			0
@entity192 has been excluded from my @entity193 for this reason			0
considering the possible future and writing this will has been very hard for me , but the most important thing is that i wish the best for you all and my grandchildren in the future			0
i do hope you all understand and respect my decisions			0
for @entity77 and @entity76 , i feel your father should be able to help you as the divorce settlement looks ultimately to be in his favour and that i have given you the best i could in terms of bringing you up and being a mother			0
i have always tried to give you both the best of everything i have been able to , and i will always love you and your children dearly			0
