telescopes come in all shapes and sizes - from orbiting space telescopes just a few metres long to the ambitious ' square kilometer array ' planned for @entity5 or @entity6 , where a network of linked dishes will stare at the sky together			0
but detecting neutrinos - tiny , fast - moving particles that pass easily through matter - is more difficult			1
neutrino detectors are often located deep underground , to cut out interference			0
a new telescope planned for the sea bed under the @entity17 will be a network of detectors with a volume of several cubic kilometers - each detector is taller than the @entity22 tower in @entity23			1
the @entity25 telescope planned for the sea bed under the @entity17 will be a network of detectors with a volume of several cubic kilometres , built to detect neutrinos - tiny , fast - moving particles that pass straight through water and even solid rock ' any time you detect a particle , what you 're always doing is having the particle interact with some kind of matter , whether it 's water , steel , air or ice , ' says @entity41 , a particle physicist at @entity42			1
' the less the particle interacts , the more material you need for it to interact in			0
' the sea water in between the @entity47 detectors works as a giant optical ' detector ' - the detectors look for ' flashes ' caused by neutrinos hitting water molecules			1
most of the neutrinos pass straight through , but the few that do collide with atoms will be picked up by the huge telescope			2
the detector 's discoveries could propel research in dark matter and high energy physics			2
construction could start as early as next year			0
the @entity25 's detectors compared to some of the tallest towers on earth - each one will be higher than @entity23 's @entity22 tower over the past decade the three pilot projects have explored the idea , building and deploying smaller scale prototype telescopes designed to operate at depths ranging from 2500 to 4500 m. @entity74 - on the floor of the @entity17 near @entity76 , @entity77 - is now the largest neutrino telescope in the @entity80 hemispere , made of twelve 350 - metre detectors on the sea bed			1
the @entity74 detector - a prototype for @entity47 - consists of 12 750m detectors on the sea bed near @entity76 , @entity77			2
it 's the current largest on earth ' the @entity17 is ideal for these huge structures - thanks to water of excellent optical properties at the right depth and excellent shore - baseddata processing , ' says the @entity47 organisation			0
' the @entity25 neutrino telescope will be unique in the world in its physics sensitivity and will provide access to scientific data that will propel research in different fields , including astronomy , dark matter searches , cosmic ray and high energy physics			0
