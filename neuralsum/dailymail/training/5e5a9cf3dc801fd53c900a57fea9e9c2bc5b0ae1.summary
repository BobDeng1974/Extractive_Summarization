@entity1 embassy officials will attend a @entity3 meeting on monday where @entity4 will convey the formalities in its plan to execute @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity4 's @entity9 has invited all embassies with citizens to be executed to the meeting , which could mean the executions will take place this week			1
when @entity4 executed one @entity4 and five foreign nationals last month , the meeting with embassies , the announcement of the 72 - hours notice and the executions all happened within the week			2
the meeting wo n't provide the date but it will discuss the provision of 72 hours notice , access to prisoners for family , and the conduct of foreign media coverage , a ministry spokesman says			0
this comes after @entity7 's parents @entity32 and @entity33 left @entity35 on sunday night in the knowledge that they 're unlikely ever to see their son again			1
earlier on sunday the whole family spent time together inside @entity44 prison for what was likely to be the last time			0
it was only the second time in the past decade that the @entity7 parents have sat down together with all their children - @entity7 , brother @entity61 , two sisters and their spouses , the @entity58 reported			1
@entity61 said both his parents were leaving @entity35 ' with a heavy heart ' and that he could see the pain in their eyes as they left			1
he said that at least his mother was comforted by the fact that on friday and sunday the entire @entity7 family had been together and shared lunch in the jail			2
' it was the first time we have actually sat down and had lunch with the whole family in nine years			0
( on friday ) i think it was @entity77 's but it was still lunch			2
that was a defining moment for them , ' @entity61 said			0
@entity7 's brother @entity61 ( pictured ) said both his parents were leaving @entity35 ' with a heavy heart ' @entity1 lawyer @entity84 ( centre ) leaves after visiting death - row prisoners @entity7 and @entity8 at the @entity44 in @entity35 on sunday in an interview with the @entity88 , @entity61 revealed that despite the pain and agony his family were experiencing , moments of joy also shone through			1
' we all want to leave him happy			0
he 's been able to see his nephew , @entity95 , ' @entity61 said			0
' he 's six months old and he 's rapt about seeing him			0
' basically , it 's the first time we got together as an extended family in nine years			0
it 's been our first lunch together			0
' one of the @entity7 family 's most cherished memories will be how several prisoners wrote to @entity4 president @entity103 offering to die in @entity7 's place			1
' it has just been phenomenal , ' said @entity61			0
' i know @entity7 reflects on that and thinks it is a big thing			2
' there are other people on death row , there are big issues in the world			0
but to know its on the forefront of everyone 's mind at the moment - it makes them think ' wow '			0
' however , there 's still hope of a late reprieve after it was alleged by the men 's lawyers on sunday night that the @entity4 judges who sentenced @entity7 and @entity8 to death offered leniency in exchange for money			1
both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve but the pair 's lawyers will seek a meeting with @entity4 's attorney - general @entity136 on monday to ask for the executions to be delayed , pending further legal challenges			1
their legal team has made a complaint with the @entity141 , based on public comments by @entity7 and @entity8 's former lawyer , @entity143			1
they have also challenged of the presidential decrees denying the men clemency without examining their cases or giving reasons			0
mr @entity143 last week alleged there had been ' interference ' in the case that saw the @entity1 sentenced to death when they should have been jailed for life			2
their complaint claims the judges in the original trial offered a more lenient sentence in exchange for cash			1
mr @entity136 says this round of executions takes more planning , because prisoners have to be transferred from various jails to the execution location , nusakambangan island , off @entity168			0
on monday morning prime minister @entity169 said he was not ' hugely optimistic ' that their death sentences would be overturned			1
' it is the eleventh hour , we have n't given up hope but i am not hugely optimistic , ' mr @entity169 said on @entity176			2
' we 've just got to keep working as hard as we can			0
every different angle we 've got to try and that 's what we 're doing			0
' they should never have done what they did , they certainly deserve to spend a very long time in jail but both of them seem to be reformed characters and they deserve time in jail they do n't deserve death			0
' authorities have permission to move @entity7 and @entity8 from @entity35 's @entity44 jail , and would like to do it ' as soon as possible '			1
@entity44 prison governor @entity194 told reporters he is ready for the transfer ' any time , any day '			0
@entity8 and @entity7 are expected to be taken to @entity197 , where they will be executed by firing squad despite their proven rehabilitation he said @entity7 and @entity8 - who are considered leaders in the prison for their tireless work to help the rehabilitation and welfare of others - seemed somewhat resigned to the executions			1
' they have surrendered even though there 's still legal efforts going on , ' he said on sunday			0
' when clemency is rejected , there 's no other option , what else can we do ? ' let 's just pray			0
who knows , there can be miracles			0
' the @entity221 said that in an extraordinary statement after visiting the men inside @entity44 , mr @entity143 said he was prepared to ' take the heat ' and provide the ' never revealed evidence ' to @entity7 and @entity8 's current lawyer , @entity226			1
' it 's something that implicates us , it could discredit me			0
but for them i will take it			0
i told @entity8 it 's okay , ' mr @entity143 said cryptically			2
' it 's one last thing i can do for them			0
' following his dramatic , if imprecise , comments , mr @entity143 left @entity4 to travel to @entity237 for a religious pilgrimage			2
a general view shows the death island of @entity197 island , upon which @entity4 's maximum security prison is located and prisoners on death row are executed but as the @entity247 pair on death row come to terms with their imminent execution , the @entity4 justice system is being accused of hypocrisy after a local ice manufacturer avoided the death penalty			1
while @entity1 @entity8 and @entity7 face execution for attempting to smuggle drugs into @entity1 from @entity35 , local kingpin @entity254 has been given only a jail sentence for a similar crime			1
despite hundreds of pleas for clemency for @entity8 and @entity7 , @entity4 president @entity103 maintains that his hard - line stance against drug dealers will not budge			1
but the story of @entity254 , an @entity4 ice manufacturer who was convicted in 2007 and was handed the death penalty before his appeal - which followed directly after the @entity247 duos ' - won him both a reduced sentence and most importantly , his life , @entity270 reported			1
prime minister @entity169 called out @entity4 's justice system for its hypocrisy @entity4 police tighten security at the main gate of maximum security prison @entity197 death - row prisoner @entity8 's sister @entity278 , left , and his mother @entity281 , right , have been visiting him every day @entity7 's mother @entity33 arrives to visit her son at @entity44 on thursday this is despite @entity285 , who owned the drug - producing business based in @entity287 , @entity288 , and organised ice 's distribution , was caught by police with over 11kg of the drug			1
when @entity7 and @entity8 lodged their final appeal to the @entity296 in @entity3 in 2011 , numbered case 37 and 38 , @entity285 's appeal for life was directly after theirs , numbered 39			1
but while the @entity1 ' judicial review was rejected , in @entity285 's casae it was decided that the death penalty violated both the @entity4 constitution , the country 's human rights and quoted the @entity306 , according to @entity270			1
his prison sentence was subsequently reduced to 12 years and @entity285 was saved from execution			0
the result presents a stark contrast to the trials endured by @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity8 is passionate painter who has been conducting art classes to other inmates while in @entity44 jail			2
the classes have been his way of showing he has rehabilitated in this photo taken on august 17 , 2010 , convicted @entity1 drug smugglers @entity8 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) gesture as they sit inside @entity44 in @entity320 , @entity35 prime minister @entity169 has also called out @entity4 's justice system for its hypocrisy after mr @entity103 offered ' optimum protection ' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers			1
' i should also just observe today that millions of @entity1 are feeling very , very upset about what may soon happen to two @entity1 in @entity4 , ' mr @entity169 said			2
' my plea even at this late stage is for @entity4 to be as responsive to us as it expects other countries to be to them when they plead for the lives of their citizens on death row overseas			2
' officials have been granted permission to transfer the two men from @entity44 jail in @entity35			2

@entity7 's *distraught* parents may now never see their son again
his brother says both his parents were leaving @entity35 ' with a heavy heart '
it 's alleged judges in the case offered leniency in exchange for money
lawyers have made a complaint with the @entity141
but @entity7 and @entity8 could be executed in days
an @entity4 meth manufacturer and *supplier* *evaded* the death penalty
his appeal decided the death penalty violated the country 's constitution
prime minister @entity169 has called out the country 's double *standards*
