by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 17:52 est , 23 october 2013 a grieving pensioner was ordered to pay a carer £ 3,500 for ‘ unfair dismissal ’ because he cut her hours when his wife died			1
@entity7 , 77 , was told he breached @entity9 ’s contract by not giving notice that her hours would decrease after his wife @entity12 ’s death			1
mrs @entity9 had cared for @entity16 ’s sufferer mrs @entity14 for five years , with her wages paid by the council			2
when his wife died , mr @entity7 offered to pay the carer himself – for fewer hours than before – to help as he coped with his loss			1
she sat next to the pensioner at mrs @entity14 ’s funeral , holding his hand and wiping his tears			2
but the very next day , she resigned by letter , demanding redundancy pay			2
grieving : pensioner @entity7 , 77 , has been forced to pay thousands of pounds in compensation to his carer who sued him for constructive dismissal when her hours were cut after the death of his wife @entity12 trusting : mr @entity7 said that wife @entity12 , who died earlier this year , would have been ' turning in her grave ' if she had known about the request for money yesterday , the ‘ devastated ’ grandfather of one said : ‘ how was i supposed to give her notice ? you do n’t have notice when your wife is going to die			1
‘ my wife would be heartbroken because she trusted @entity9			1
we never thought she would do that			0
‘ at @entity12 ’s funeral , she was telling everyone she was going to look after me , then the next day she was asking for redundancy money			2
‘ it ’s unreal – we treated her like a daughter and she has betrayed us			2
’ mrs @entity9 , 55 , took mr @entity7 to an employment tribunal			1
a judge rejected her claim , but on appeal she was awarded £ 3,568 , including redundancy pay and compensation for constructive unfair dismissal and breach of contract			1
last night , her husband @entity57 , 59 , said : ‘ she ’s been given the redundancy money which she is entitled to and that ’s the end of the story			0
husbands die , children die , wives die – it happens , i ’m afraid			0
mr @entity7 was @entity9 ’s employer , it is as simple as that			1
i do n’t think it ’s a large bill – he ’s sitting on loads of premium bonds anyway			0
’ even though mrs @entity14 ’s care was funded by @entity72 , mr @entity7 will have to pay the whole compensation sum from his own pocket			1
that is because he is legally classed as mrs @entity9 ’s employer after paying her privately for just a few days after his wife ’s death			2
the retired accountant said he does not know how he will cope and accused the council of ‘ washing their hands of the issue ’			0
not responsible : @entity72 said that as mr @entity7 was not in receipt of adult care services from the council it was not liable for claims made via the tribunal he said : ‘ i ’m on a company and state pension , but i just have n’t got the money to pay for this			1
’ mr @entity7 said he offered to pay the carer for 16 hours a week , when she had previously put in 30 hours a week caring for mrs @entity14			1
but mrs @entity9 told the tribunal in @entity96 that she quit because there was no written offer			2
mr @entity7 added that the incident had taken its toll on him and he had since suffered a minor stroke			1
he said : ‘ it ’s ruined my health			0
my doctor told me it has been brought on by the stress of this case			0
‘ to contact me the day after i lost my wife is disgusting			0
‘ and when she pushed a letter through the door saying she was suing me – my world fell apart			0
‘ i will never forgive her , ’ he said , speaking from his home in @entity112 , @entity72			0
both mr @entity7 , and ms @entity9 live in @entity112 , @entity72 ( pictured )			1
mrs @entity14 's care had been paid for by @entity114 , but these funds were stopped when she died mr @entity7 started caring for his wife of 51 years , a retired quality controller , when she was diagnosed with @entity16 ’s almost 25 years ago			1
as her condition grew worse , mrs @entity9 , a neighbour of the couple at the time , came in as a carer			2
at first , the council paid mrs @entity9 directly , but later mr @entity7 received a grant to cover the cost			1
his son @entity123 , managing director of a digital agency , said : ‘ all this has really upset dad			0
‘ one day she was sitting in the front row of the church holding dad ’s hand at mum ’s funeral , the next there ’s a letter pushed through his door			0
’ entitled : @entity9 's husband @entity57 said that the carer had been given the redundancy money she was entitled to the 44 - year - old said pensioners who pay for care should be careful			1
‘ once the council stopped paying for care direct , people like @entity143 were made to employ people themselves and then pay them out of the money the council gave them , ’ he said			0
‘ that means they have a responsibility for @entity153 , holiday pay and even redundancy payments			0
‘ but no one made this clear to my father			0
he had never employed anybody in his life			0
‘ this has been a real kick in the teeth for all of us , especially dad			0
legally i understand why the appeal was upheld , but morally there ’s something very wrong about this			0
’ a council spokesman said : ‘ mr @entity7 has not been in receipt of adult care services from @entity72			1
‘ his care arrangements , therefore , were a private matter and the council is not liable for claims made via an employment tribunal			1
’ mrs @entity9 was not available for comment .			2

@entity7 , 77 , was taken to employment tribunal by @entity9
@entity182 's hours were cut from 30 hours to 16 after mr @entity7 's wife @entity12 died
ms @entity9 said she was forced to resign
judge rules carer was unfairly treated and orders pensioner to pay £ 3,500
