click here for all the stats from our brilliant @entity2 , including this graphic of @entity6 's opening goal for @entity7			1
@entity8 became the latest team to be eliminated from the @entity10 when @entity11 forward @entity6 scored the winning goal in @entity14 past club - mate @entity15			1
but they will depart their first @entity10 feeling aggrieved after @entity17 had a goal wrongly chalked off for offside when the score was 0 - 0 and then @entity6 ’s struck in controversial circumstances after 29 minutes			1
@entity22 sent @entity8 skipper @entity23 to the floor with a robust challenge before setting up @entity6 to fire home from eight yards			2
and in an agonising finale , @entity17 hit the post when a goal would have kept @entity8 's tournament hopes alive			2
@entity8 knew there was no margin error after unluckily losing their opening game 2 - 1 to @entity35			1

booked : @entity83 referee : @entity99 ( @entity100 ) * @entity2 ratings by @entity102 but they faced a rejuvenated @entity7 who offered a lot more than their turgid goalless draw with @entity108 would have suggested			0
it was a bright start for @entity111 ’s most populous nation			0
21 - year - old striker @entity65 , who plays his club football in the @entity113 with @entity114 , was a whisker away from applying a finishing touch after the ball flashed dangerously across the @entity8 goal			0
@entity38 shot wide when well - placed – which would n’t surprise @entity121 fans – and @entity15 was forced to tip away from @entity62 as @entity8 were put under the cosh			0
but @entity8 , who have only been members of @entity124 for 18 years , were robbed of the first goal after 21 minutes when @entity17 timed his run to perfection to convert a clever through pass by @entity87			0
the @entity11 forward , with 10 goals in qualification , could n’t believe it as he turned to celebrate and saw the linesman ’s flag in the air for offside , when he ’d been half - a - yard on			0
ironically , it was the only chance @entity17 put away			0
four more times he had opportunities to score but was twice denied by @entity7 ’s excellent goalkeeper @entity57 and twice missed the target			0
no way past : @entity8 striker @entity17 ( right ) is brought down by a tackle from @entity7 's @entity38 come back ! @entity143 's @entity81 ( right ) grabs the foot of @entity7 midfielder @entity63 battle : @entity79 ( right ) muscles @entity6 off the ball during the first half in @entity14 heads up : @entity50 ( left ) and @entity78 challenge for the ball in the air at the @entity152 got it covered : @entity15 gets down low to push away a long - range @entity7 effort during the second half @entity8 's @entity87 saw plenty of the ball in midfield but could n't inspire his team to victory , as his heat map below shows - click here for more from our @entity2 @entity8 ’s frustration increased when @entity7 took the lead			1
@entity23 tried to block the run of @entity169 but when the powerful striker bundled over him in retaliation and the @entity8 captain fell to the floor , @entity167 referee @entity166 waved play on			0
from the resulting cross , @entity6 scored emphatically to leave @entity7 coach @entity175 glad he ’d patched up his differences with the @entity177 forward who did n’t play for his country for two years			2
@entity7 need a draw in their final game against @entity35 to guarantee their progress to the last - 16 but they will qualify regardless of their result if @entity108 fail to beat @entity8			1
in control : @entity7 defender @entity60 leaps into the air to bring the ball down as @entity17 chases him on the run : @entity7 winger @entity65 ( right ) sprints away from @entity8 's @entity85 on the slide : @entity79 skips over a challenge from @entity7 captain @entity59 ( left ) having a go : @entity22 fires a powerful right - footed shot towards @entity15 's goal @entity8 playmaker @entity87 tried to inspire his team - mates to draw level with a energetic performance in midfield			1
but his low shot was saved by @entity57 late on while substitute @entity86 , who scored against @entity35 , failed to head in from a corner with @entity8 ’s best chance of the second half			1
then , in injury - time , @entity17 agonisingly sent a header straight at @entity57 before sending another shot against the keeper and onto the post , leaving the @entity8 players to collapse in tears at the final whistle			0
safe hands : @entity17 is denied a goal by a fine save from @entity7 goalkeeper @entity57 solid : @entity8 's wall block a powerful free - kick from @entity7 midfielder @entity38 ( right ) my ball ! striker @entity22 ( left ) attempts to hold off @entity8 skipper @entity23 ( right ) crowded out : @entity59 ( left ) and @entity214 ( centre ) attempt a double challenge on @entity17 ( right ) up for the cup : @entity7 's victory leaves them on the verge of reaching the last 16 in @entity221			1

@entity6 scores winner in first half in @entity14
@entity7 move up to second place in @entity227 while @entity8 are eliminated
