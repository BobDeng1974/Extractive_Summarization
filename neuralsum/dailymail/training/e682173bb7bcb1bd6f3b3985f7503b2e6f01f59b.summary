@entity0 is the most cherished player of the @entity2 public , mainly because of his enormous empathy with the people			1
he always has a smile on his face for the fans , is the first to sign autographs and even expresses more emotion when singing the national anthem than his @entity2 - born team - mates			0
unlike other @entity13 players who have played for @entity14 , @entity0 has always been popular with the @entity2 people			1
gone ! @entity0 was sent off by referee @entity16 during @entity14 's 4 - 0 defeat against @entity18 on monday ouch ! @entity0 leaned into @entity19 after the pair had begun a spat with @entity14 already two goals down the controversies that he was involved with at @entity24 never affected how much @entity2 people saw him , because they understood his extreme passion in defending his club this time , however , by getting sent off for his headbutt on @entity19 in @entity14 ’s 4 - 0 defeat to @entity18 , his image appears much more spoiled in @entity31			1
the press did n't spare him after the game and the public vox pops also saw him heavily criticised			0
but knowing @entity0 , he willl issue a public apology and will be forgiven again			2
and that should happen in the next few days , in a way that pleases the @entity38 , because they also want him to clean up his image			0
for example , the main theme in @entity31 the day after this controversy are the injuries of @entity44 and @entity45			0
@entity0 ’s sending off is of less importance			2
if you asked the majority of @entity2 people if they still want @entity0 to play , perhaps a few would say no today , but in a few days most would say yes			2
laying down the gauntlet : @entity19 ended up netting a hat - trick for @entity18 in their opening game win every little helps : @entity0 is one of @entity55 's best friends which aids his relationship with the public the vast majority , over 90 per cent , will say that the player born in @entity13 must be in the team			1
we may well say that @entity0 's image has been damaged after the @entity18 defeat , but not enough , as we say here in @entity31 , to put his head on the guillotine			1
the fact that he 's one of @entity55 ’s closest friends also helps him within the national squad and the @entity2 people			1
everyone knows , even those most critical of his behaviour , that without @entity14 will struggle to beat @entity74 or @entity75 , because @entity76 or @entity77 are not at his level			0
also because his importance to the team , the @entity38 did n't criticise the player after his red card and his behaviour			0
for sure if it was another player without @entity0 ’s influence on the team , the treatment would be very different .			0

@entity14 defender was sent off for headbutt against @entity18
*victim* @entity19 *scored* a hat - trick for @entity93 's side
@entity0 is *big* friends with *talisman* @entity55
