by @entity0 published : 04:49 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 02:06 est , 14 march 2014 a supermarket price war on an unprecedented scale was under way last night with the prospect of permanent cuts in the cost of many basic foods			2
it was triggered as @entity10 announced discounts worth £ 1billion over the next three years in a bid to fight off budget rivals @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity16 responded immediately with an advertising campaign claiming to undercut @entity10 and promising big savings on major brands			0
the cost of some everyday essentials could fall by up to a quarter as the ‘ big four ’ take on @entity14 and @entity15 , who have grabbed a huge chunk of their market share in recent years in what has been the biggest change in grocery shopping habits since the dawn of the supermarket age more than 50 years ago			1
last night @entity14 raised the stakes further with a promise to save shoppers 35 per cent on their weekly shop			1
fears of the effect of a price war on profits gripped the @entity45 yesterday , wiping £ 2billion of the combined share value of @entity23 , @entity24 ’s and @entity10			1
@entity10 shares were down more than 10 per cent at one point			0
profits at @entity16 , which is part of the world ’s biggest retailer , @entity50 giant @entity51 , are also likely to suffer			0
bosses at @entity10 believe only a fundamental shift to lower prices will guarantee the chain ’s future after it posted losses of £ 176million			1
@entity16 , @entity23 and @entity24 ’s all pledge they will match @entity10 prices , so will inevitably be drawn into a price war			2
@entity23 has made its own price cuts in recent weeks , with the cost of a four - pint carton of milk cut from £ 1.39 to £ 1 and reductions on some fruit and vegetables			1
battle : @entity14 and @entity15 have been gaining in market share thanks to increasingly price - conscious customers @entity23 ’s cuts had already seen it promise £ 200million in short - term savings but will now have to go much further			1
retail experts at one @entity45 firm described the scale of the reductions promised by @entity10 as like ‘ getting the bazooka out ’			2
the firm , founded in @entity83 in 1899 , admitted that the price cuts will hit profits by more than £ 300million a year over the next three years			1
but chief executive @entity86 said the ‘ big four ’ chains had lost millions of customers and billions of pounds in sales to @entity14 and @entity15 , and needed to catch up			1
the grocery sector is facing the biggest structural shift ‘ since the 1950s and the advent of supermarkets ’ as shoppers – even those not struggling financially – turn to budget stores , he said			2
‘ the biggest challenge that we face is that there has been a fundamental change in how consumers view discounters			0
‘ they are no longer going to them out of necessity			0
the perception has changed and there is a new price norm			0
’ a study suggested this week that the big four have lost sales worth £ 4.4billion a year over the past three years			2
the cost of living squeeze saw millions of middle - income shoppers switch to the budget chains – and many have stayed			2
sales at @entity10 are down by 3.2 per cent in the past year , while @entity14 ’s are up a remarkable 33.5 per cent and @entity15 ’s 16.5 per cent			1
mr @entity86 said : ‘ we are going to lower our prices on a permanent @entity120 rules have changed and we must change too			2
it is absolutely critical that we begin winning again in our core supermarkets			0
to do that we must compete on price			2
’ the money to cover the loss in profits will come partly from the sale of property thought to be worth £ 1billion			0
a snapshot survey of prices at @entity10 and @entity14 yesterday , suggests it will have to make significant reductions to match its @entity133 - owned budget rival			1
plunge : the company 's share price fell by 10 per cent this morning after the loss was announced for example , @entity14 charges £ 5 for a 200g jar of @entity139 , which is £ 6.58 at @entity10 and the other mainstream chains			1
a large white sliced loaf is just 55p at @entity14 versus 65p at @entity10 and anything up to £ 1 at the other giants			1
a 500g pack of fusilli pasta is 49p , against 95p , while a 1kg bag of basmati rice is £ 1.29 , compared with £ 1.79			0
a 500g box of corn flakes is 99p at @entity14 versus £ 1.45 at @entity10			1
@entity10 is to press ahead with the roll - out of its online shopping service and the opening of small convenience stores in a bid to catch up with its major rivals , who have cashed in by offering home deliveries and filling high streets and petrol stations with smaller stores			0
its annual loss of £ 176million included one - off costs of £ 903million			1
but underlying profits were down 13 per cent to £ 785million and these are expected to fall by more than half to fund the price cuts			0
@entity166 of @entity167 , who is responsible for investing billions of pounds of pension funds , said : ‘ investors know a price war is coming			0
‘ @entity14 and @entity15 are growing shares at double digit while the majors are losing market share and they have to do something about it			1
if they are relatively expensive – and the customers know it – they need a price reset , or price war , whatever you want to call it , before they can move forward in terms of sales			0
’ @entity184 , head of equities at @entity187 stockbrokers , said : ‘ the discount supermarkets have become a thorn in the side for the bigger players			0
‘ @entity192 ’s has now decided that it is time to revitalise the business , which will inevitably come at a cost			0
’ the reputation of @entity14 and @entity15 were enhanced last night as both picked up prizes at the @entity199			1
@entity15 won own brand range of the year , while @entity14 was named retailer of the year			1
success : @entity10 expanded under the watch of sir @entity192 , son of the firm 's founder @entity10 is one of the country 's oldest supermarkets , having started trading as a market stall in @entity83 , @entity210 in 1899			2
however , it did not become a major player on a national scale until a decade ago , when it took over the @entity215 supermarket chain			0
the company , whose full title is @entity10 , was named after its founder @entity219 , who sold egg and butter in @entity83 's @entity222			0
its major expansion came under the founder 's son , sir @entity192 , who took over in 1952 at the age of 21 and remains president of the company			0
he opened @entity83 's first modern - style grocery store , and in 1967 floated the firm on the @entity230			2
in 2004 , @entity10 expanded beyond its home region by buying @entity215 and taking over its stock of nearly 500 stores			0
the company now operates more than 550 branches around the @entity236 , and is the country 's fourth - biggest supermarket with a market share of around 11 per cent			1
however , it has run into difficulties in recent years after being crowded out by discount retailers and the rise of online shopping .			0
