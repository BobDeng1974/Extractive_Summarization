when a gentle spot of fishing is interrupted by a five - metre crocodile , the first thing most people would do is run for the safety of dry land			2
but when 18 - year - old @entity8 came face to face with this maneater , he was cool - headed enough to take a picture - showing the beast with a barramundi in its jaws			1
he took the amazing snap two years ago but it went viral last week after he posted it to @entity17 accounts fishtildeath and @entity19 , immediately attracting hundreds of likes			2
the 5m crocodile devours the barramundi , stealing the catch from @entity8 and rather than be scared off by his close encounter , @entity25 , from @entity26 , northern @entity27 , is still annoyed he lost out on his prize catch			1
‘ we were fishing off a bank on a lagoon near @entity33 ( in the @entity34 ) and we saw these bubbles coming up , ’ @entity25 told the @entity29			2
‘ suspecting it was a smaller croc , we kept casting and i hooked that fish right next to the bubbles			0
‘ i fought the fish to the bank but could n’t drag it up			0
we usually hook them with a long - handed gaff but we decided to wait and see what the bubbles did just in case			0
’ @entity47 , north @entity27 , where the crocodile struck ‘ the croc just lunged out of the water at us , coming within one metre or so from me , before sliding backwards into the water			1
it saw the barra floundering on the edge and picked it up and sat right there crushing it			0
you could hear the fish ’s bones cracking			1
’ it was at this point that the cool - headed teen took the picture			1
after the croc had finished his meal he snapped the line as it swam away			0
‘ i was pretty shaken up by it , ’ @entity25 said .			0
