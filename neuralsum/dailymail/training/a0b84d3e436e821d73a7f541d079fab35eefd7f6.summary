alarming : thefts of valuable ¿ green ¿ catalytic converters from cars have more than doubled over the past three years thefts of valuable ‘ green ’ catalytic converters from cars have more than doubled over the past three years , new figures reveal			1
criminals are ripping out the anti-pollution devices from cars and vans because they contain increasingly precious and sought - after metals such as platinum and palladium - leaving motorists with repair bills of thousands of pounds			1
soaring scrap metal prices have seen thefts increase ten fold in some areas			1
altogether almost 25,000 thefts were reported to police forces across the @entity21 between 2010 and the first half of this year			1
police say 4x4 vehicles and vans are particularly at risk because they are easy to crawl underneath			1
the scale of the increase is revealed in a @entity30 investigation ( must credit )			2
figures from 40 @entity21 police forces revealed thefts @entity21 had more than doubled from 3,957 in 2010 to 8,947 in 2012			1
but some parts of the country saw an even more significant rise			0
in @entity39 ( up from 31 to 340 ) and @entity38 ( up from 15 to 177 ) thefts increased more than ten-fold			2
and they more than tripled across @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 during the same period			0
@entity45 - @entity44 in @entity46 has seen a 27-fold increase from just 2 thefts in 2010 to 55 in 2012.catalytic converters reduce poisonous gases from the vehicle ’s exhaust system			1
@entity53 , a senior analyst with @entity54 , says rises in the global price of platinum have fuelled the illegal trade			2
he said : ‘ we ’ve seen that in the past metals such as platinum and palladium are affected by the changes in the market			1
that would be reflected at scrap metal dealer level by the dealer offering a better price for that material			0
‘ we ’ve identified that when there are increases in the price of these metals and materials then we often see an increase in levels of theft reported to us			2
’ det supt @entity78 , national co-ordinator for the @entity79 , said organised criminals were behind the increases in theft : ‘ we have had depots and fleets being hit , and that suggests a level of pre-planning that is n’t involved in your spontaneous type of offending			0
’ she added : ‘ we know from our intelligence from the arrests we ’ve made that most of the people we have arrested are @entity21 residents			1
there is an element of eastern @entity97 involvement but a lot of these people are people who trawl around the country in order to attack particular locations that have been identified as vulnerable			0
’ det @entity104 said : ‘ catalytic converters can be processed through some scrap metal dealers , but they need to have a particular piece of equipment to be able to do that			0
‘ in another twist , police say some catalytic converters are exported directly in containers to emerging economies where they are either reused or broken down			2
easy target : police say 4x4 vehicles like this @entity118 are particularly at risk because they are easy for crooks to crawl underneath new laws that came into force on 1 october banned cash payments for scrap metal with the aim of making it easier to trace people selling stolen metal			1
among the victims are @entity130 whose fleet of delivery vans was targeted by thieves just before christmas 2011			2
fifteen of his vehicles were stripped of their catalytic converters when his depot was raided one night			2
mr @entity130 said the thief managed to saw through and remove all 15 catalytic converters within 45 minutes : ‘ the cost to the business was significant			0
i mean keeping the vehicles on hire and bringing in new vehicles would have cost us £ 15,000 to £ 20,000			2
’ but he stressed : ‘ the real cost is the lost revenue in the stores , which we estimate will be in excess of £ 100,000			0
so the real risk to the business , was going out of business			0
’ up to 600 jobs were put at risk by the thefts , he added			1
modern cars are fitted with catalytic converters to reduce harmful emissions of hydrocarbons , carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere			0
they contain a ceramic honeycombed core coated with metals such as platinum , palladium and rhodium			1
the metals act as catalysts and convert the harmful gases into water vapour and less harmful emissions			0
a @entity176 spokesman said it was not illegal to drive without a catalytic converter but you could be stopped by the police and prosecuted for breaking the law on harmful emissions			0
most vehicles will also fail an @entity184 test without a catalytic converter			0
the police and @entity187 say that to help foil the thieves , catalytic converters can be uniquely marked in acid with a serial number			0
motorists are advised to keep their cars in garages or park in well - lit areas			1
most converters are bolted on - but they can also be welded			0
firms with fleets are advised to obstruct access to high vehicles by parking cars with lower ground clearance round them and to install @entity205 cameras .			1
