thought the black and blue dress was an optical illusion ? it 's nothing compared to these mind - boggling pictures by a @entity6 photographer , artist , and @entity9 genius			1
@entity10 , 30 , who is based in @entity11 , @entity12 , says he does n’t capture moments , but instead captures ideas			1
he takes mundane scenarios , including houses , cars and streets and transforms them into optical illusions , which he describes as , ' surreal ideas realised in a realistic way with a touch of humour '			2
in this image called the architect the subject seems to be both inside and outside the house @entity10 , born in @entity36 , @entity6 , who aims to challenge and perplex the viewer , uses his artistry to confuse people who look at his work			1
from cars seemingly driving upside - down on bridges to spaces that , at a glance , appear to be a bedroom and then suddenly look like a field , his work is challenging , clever and full of subtle detail			1
@entity10 explains that he wants his work to evoke a problem - solving approach			1
although one photo can consist of hundreds of different images merged into one , he always wants it to look like it could have snapped by a camera			1
he said : ' it ’s the challenge : can i put this very weird idea in a photograph and make it look like it was just captured ? ' in a series of behind - the - scenes videos he gives an insight into his painstaking method			1
to make @entity65 , a work of visual trickery that looks as though green fields - rather than water - are pouring over a cliff edge , he layered 235 separate images			1
he photographed the fields to provide the backdrop , then built a scale model of a house and landscape out of cardboard , which he covered in gloopy green paint and shot			0
he takes mundane scenarios and gives them a more interesting edge by flipping them on their head , like in @entity65 in @entity87 , a man is seen pulling aside the night sky as he would a curtain to reveal the dawn and green landscape before him using @entity9 , he turned the running paint into rolling fields and superimposed a photograph of a house on to the cardboard model , adding a photo of a water wheel to complete the fantastical and dramatic shot of a dreamy , bucolic landscape that seems to be falling over a cliff			2
on his website he writes : ' i get inspiration from all things around me			0
anything from things i see in my daily life to other artist ’s work and photography			2
i think it ’s a lot about looking at the world from a different perspective			0
' i think i get more inspiration from paintings rather than photos			0
but there are tons of inspiration online			0
here are some websites and blogs i visit for inspiration			0
' he cites @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 as artistic influences			0
each image can anything from a few weeks to years to create			2
@entity10 says each idea starts with a sketch and if he thinks it 's good enough he will start planning how to do it			1
this image , entitled @entity134 , shows a woman walking down a winding road that 's crumbling behind her every step is it a bedroom or a field ? in closing out , interiors and exterior meld as one in this seemingly simple tableau in the optical illusion @entity147 , a man is hiding his real view with a better , more idealised image on wallpaper which he hangs on a line he said : ' once i ’ve come up with an idea that i think is good enough to realise i need to find the places i need to shoot to put the photo together			1
this can take anywhere between a few days to several months , sometimes years			2
' this is the most important step as it defines the look and feel of the photo , it ’s my raw material			0
this step also includes problem solving , how to make the reflections , materials etc realistic			2
' he then sets about collecting or creating all the aspects he needs to bring his vision to life			0
' the final part is putting the photos together			0
this takes anything from a few days to several weeks			0
this is actually the easiest step , if i did a good job in the first and second step			0
' this part is like a puzzle , i have all the pieces , i just need to put them together			2
reverse opposite is mind - bendig as , with an @entity126 drawing , the car seems both on and under the bridge at the same time in @entity10 's description of this picture , called cutting light , he describes it as ' the strongest light bulb there is			1
cutting through wood , concrete and stone in just moments ' this image is called @entity200 and captures the state between dream world and reality although one photo can consist of lots of different images merged into one , he always wants it to look like it could have been captured as a whole picture			1
in helping @entity210 , a woman is seen hoovering leaves off the tree to help the process along			0

@entity6 photographer , @entity10 , spends months photographing images to build up to the finished picture
each image is made up of hundreds of separate shots and painstakingly detailed work by the expert *retoucher*
