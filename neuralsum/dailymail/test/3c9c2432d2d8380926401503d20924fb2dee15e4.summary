@entity0 will welcome ' controller ' @entity1 back to the heart of his @entity5 team as he attempts to launch another late survival bid with a record fifth successive derby victory			1
the 27 - year - old enforcer has missed the last two games through suspension after reaching 10 bookings for the season , and that meant he was unavailable for the @entity18 's first game in charge , a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity10 on march 21			2
however , @entity1 was the only man told he will definitely start against @entity21 on sunday during friday 's team meeting , and @entity0 is looking for a big response from a player who has once again missed a significant proportion of the campaign to date through injury			1
@entity0 will welcome back @entity1 after the midfielder missed the defeat to @entity10 the @entity5 manager has confirmed that @entity1 will definitely start the game against @entity21 he said : ' he was the only one i told at the team meeting this morning that he will play , so he knows			1
' definitely they missed him because he did not play for 10 or 11 games			2
he had 10 weeks out - that 's quite a long time			0
' he is the controller of the team and a player with experience , so for the team it is good , not only as a player , but also as a person , that he 's back in the team			0
' @entity1 's return could hardly be more timely with @entity5 sitting just a point clear of the @entity49 relegation zone with eight games to play and in desperate need of a repeat of their heroics at the end of last season if they are to avoid another desperate scrap for top - flight survival			1
@entity0 and coach @entity59 discuss tactics during training ahead of the clash with @entity21 @entity1 and his team - mates share a joke during training as they prepare to face their fiercest rivals former @entity66 and @entity67 man @entity1 played his part in a remarkable escape 12 months ago , and while he insists the picture has not been as black as has been painted at times , he knows the time for action rather than talking has arrived			1
@entity1 said : ' we have n't played too badly all season , really			2
there 's been the odd bad performance which has killed us , but we just need to start getting over the line and winning some games			0
there 's not really much else to say on the matter			0
' we need to get some confidence			0
we have n't hit a roll all season , we did at the end of last season			0
it 's always been a draw , a draw , then maybe a win , and we have never got anything going			0
@entity1 played his part in a remarkable escape from relegation for the @entity5 just 12 months ago @entity1 has yet again missed large portions of @entity5 's season through injury ' this is a good time to maybe get something going and finish the season with a bit of a bang			1
' @entity1 has played in two of @entity5 's four consecutive wins over their neighbours , including the 1 - 0 victory at @entity107 in december , and an extension of that record would send spirits soaring on @entity111			1
the @entity5 have never before enjoyed five wins on the trot over the @entity114 , but while acknowledging the importance of the fixture , @entity0 - a veteran of the @entity116 as well as similar rivalries in @entity118 and @entity119 - is refusing to be distracted by the opposition this weekend			1
he said : ' it 's nice , but the past does n't count anymore			0
we do n't get more points because of the last four games			0
will @entity128 and some of the @entity5 squad share the ball around during a training session @entity5 players battle for the ball as the @entity134 prepare of their clash against @entity21 @entity136 teases the @entity5 players as he dummies a pass in training at the @entity139 ' we all know how important this is , it 's a special moment for everybody			2
but we are focused on the game and that we get the result we need			0
' every game for us is a special match			2
this , of course , because it 's @entity21 is special , but we still need points and we still have only eight games left , so in that way , it 's very important that we can show our fans that we really want to win			2
' if we can get them behind us , it can be a very important weapon			0
' while @entity157 has been boosted by @entity1 's return , he will be without central defender @entity159 , who faces up to a month on the sidelines with a knee injury			1
@entity1 will return , but defender @entity159 will miss the clash as he recovers from a knee injury			1

@entity5 midfielder has missed the @entity5 last two matches
but , manager @entity0 insists the midfielder will face @entity21
