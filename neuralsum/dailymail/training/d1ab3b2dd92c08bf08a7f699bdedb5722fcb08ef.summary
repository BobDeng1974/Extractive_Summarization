so the scuba experts rigged up a series of strings and lines so she can operate valves and flotation tubes with her knees			1
she said : ' i was looking for something to do as a challenge and i was spurred on when somebody said i could n’t do it			0
it was n’t easy at first but like everything else if you are determined you ’ll succeed			2
' if i felt myself getting knocked back i would think about how much i want to dive in the @entity7 on honeymoon with @entity10			1
' technique : mr @entity26 adjusts her breathing apparatus in the pool			2
ms @entity8 uses a special technique which enables her to propel herself through the water , despite her disabilities swim : the scuba experts rigged up a series of strings and lines so @entity8 can operate valves and flotation tubes with her knees practice : she goes through her paces in the pool			1
ms @entity8 said the attraction of diving was that it is ' peaceful and calm ' ms @entity8 learned to swim when she was a little girl but only on her back because you need arms to keep your head out of the water			2
but she said her greatest fear was making the ' giant stride ' - the term divers use to describe the moment they step over the edge of a pool or boat into the water			0
she said : ' since i was a child i ’ve been taught not to fall , as i ’d end up flat on my face because i ca n’t put out a hand to stop me			0
so stepping forward into the water felt alien to me , but now i ’ve got used to making that giant stride			0
future : ms @entity8 - pictured here with fiance @entity10 - has completed her diving qualifications with the @entity94 ' the other problem was the diving mask , you need a hand to take it off and clear it from water or misting			1
i had to concentrate on remaining calm when my mask was full of water instead of panicking , as that made it more difficult to clear			0
' ms @entity8 said she developed a technique of looking up and putting her tongue on the roof of her mouth then breathing through her nose to clear the mask			1
the charity worker , of @entity112 , @entity113 , has completed her diving qualifications with the @entity94			0

she was born without arms due to a genetic condition but said her parents refused to treat her any differently to any other child			0
she said : ' i was born without arms - there ’s never been an explanation why , but it seems to be genetic			2
i ’ve never been interested in finding out the reason			0
' my parents ’ attitude has always been just to get on with it , they never let me say i could n’t do anything - i could n’t get out of helping around the house			0
i use my feet a lot , where other people would use their hands			0
' she said the attraction of diving for her ' is that it is peaceful and calm , and , when i dive , i feel the same as other people			0
' love : the couple are now looking forward to looking at the coral and tropical fish on their honeymoon ms @entity8 is about to take delivery of a custom - made £ 950 armless dry - suit with buoyancy valves built - in so she can use her chin or knees to adjust them			2
the zip has also been adapted so she can fasten it herself			0
mr @entity10 , who is also learning to dive , said : ' i ’m really proud of her - if you tell @entity8 she ca n’t do something she will prove them wrong			1
i ca n’t wait to dive together in the @entity7 and hopefully have our photograph taken together underwater			2
' the pair praised diving instructors @entity25 and @entity26 who rigged up the elaborate system that allows ms @entity8 to operate her scuba equipment with her knees			1
mr @entity25 , 42 , said : ' @entity8 is a brave and inspiring young woman - by the time her honeymoon comes around she will be a competent diver			2
