by @entity1 correspondent @entity2 was the ' best candidate for the job ' according to @entity5 editor @entity4 , despite never having worked as a journalist before @entity5 editor @entity4 has defended his controversial new economics correspondent , insisting he was the ‘ most suitable candidate ’ for the job			1
@entity2 , who starts work with the flagship @entity10 show next month , has come under fire for his strong links to the @entity13 and the trade unions movement , as well as a youthful flirtation with the far right			0
others have questioned why he was preferred over more experienced candidates , given he has never worked as a journalist before			0
but in a letter @entity20 mp @entity19 - who had raised concerns about the appointment - mr @entity4 said mr @entity2 ’s ‘ specialist expertise ’ in economics was more important than his training as a reporter			1
he said : ‘ @entity2 was one of several candidates we considered who came from an economics rather than a conventional journalistic background … we believed a deep knowledge of economics was more important than journalistic experience for this role			0
’ he added : ‘ it will certainly not be the first time that an individual ’s communications skills and specialist expertise have made him or her the right choice despite a comparative lack of formal journalistic experience			0
’ mr @entity2 ’s previous jobs include a stint as an adviser to labour deputy leader @entity47 and time as an economist at the @entity49			2
last week , the @entity50 revealed he has penned hundreds of left - wing articles on his economics blog in which he consistently attacks conservative economic policy			1
but mr @entity4 – who is the former deputy editor of @entity56 – rejected concerns his political affiliations could affect his impartiality , saying : ‘ it is a fact that @entity10 journalists are required to put any personal views to one side when employed by @entity64 ’			2
he even described mr @entity2 ’s blog as being ‘ highly respected ’ , despite the concerns over its partisan content , and said it was considered to be ‘ relevant experience ’ when he was considered for the job			2
last night , mr @entity19 said @entity72 ’ letter failed to address his concerns about the appointment as he did not explain how many other candidates had been interviewed for the post			2
mr @entity2 is also the author of several left - wing blogs attacking the government , prompting fears the corporation is becoming biased against the conservatives he said : ‘ there has been no transparency in this process and there are still more questions than answers			1
‘ mr @entity2 ’s position is becoming increasingly untenable given he has admitted supporting the @entity89 in the past , and more recently has had strong ties to the left			1
‘ it is difficult to believe that someone with such strong beliefs is going to be impartial when he is conducting interviews on @entity5			0
‘ how long is @entity4 going to carry on defending him ? ’ in a recent blog post mr @entity2 admitted he had a ‘ misguided flirtation with the ideas of the @entity99 ’ when he was a teenager			1
he was also accused of taking part in a ‘ racist ’ bnp leafleting campaign before he rejected right - wing politics and joined the @entity103			0
a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ we are not going to comment on political affiliations of people in their teenage years whatever they may have been			0

@entity4 has defended appointment of @entity2 as economics editor
he said mr @entity2 got the job because he was ' the best candidate '
however mr @entity2 has never worked as a journalist before
he is also *prominent* left - wing blogger and associated with the @entity89
@entity20 mp @entity19 said mr @entity2 *'s* position was becoming ' untenable '
