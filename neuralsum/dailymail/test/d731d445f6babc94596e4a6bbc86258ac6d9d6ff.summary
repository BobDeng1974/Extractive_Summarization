police investigated the incident after receiving complaints from furious web users , but have now passed on the case to the club to investigate			0
@entity0 said in a statement : ' last month , @entity0 received complaints of a tweet showing an image of @entity4 fans praying during half - time at @entity24 accompanied by comments that were offensive to the complainants			1

but the support since has been very nice and i 'm thankful			0

' that day , the time came for prayer and the window would have closed before the game finished so we did it at half - time			1
