by @entity1 reporter a well - regarded @entity3 fashion designer has created a line of clothing specifically for individuals who use a wheelchair			1
@entity9 ’s @entity8 offers clothes for both disabled men and women whose fashion needs are dictated by their constantly seated form			1
because of this , conventional clothes often pose the problem of bulky fabrics , awkwardly - placed zippers , and odd draping			0
@entity8 seeks to eliminate these issues through specially - engineered designs			1
catering to seated forms : @entity8 is a @entity3 label designed for wheelchair users both genders : the label designs men 's and womenswear with wheelchair users ' special fashion needs in mind ms @entity9 created the line after @entity3 journalist @entity33 , who was paralyzed after being shot , asked her to make a custom shearling cape in 2004 – having found it immensely difficult to find a proper winter coat , as the garment ’s fabric tends to pool in awkward places on a wheelchair			1
the two embarked on multiple years ’ worth of collaboration before ms @entity9 decided to take the concept to the next level and create a line			0
hence , @entity8 was born			2
prior , ms @entity9 had operated a more conventional fashion line in @entity48 , later becoming a tv and film costumer			2
she even created a few of the furs worn by @entity54 in @entity55			0
tailor - made : designer @entity9 has installed the clothes with magnetic buttons and well - placed zippers so that wearers have an easy time using the garments @entity63 approach : ms @entity9 chose the fabric for her designs based on what would be most comfortable for consumers , as well as what would drape best when placed on a seated form but now she is designing motorcycle jackets , shirtdresses , denim skirts , and even bathrobes for women who use a wheelchair			1
designs range from $ 29 for a t - shirt to $ 299 for a biker jacket			0
menswear offerings include button - down shirts , sweaters , chinos , and even blazers that range from $ 39 to $ 199			0
of creating @entity8 , ms @entity9 says on her site : ‘ i was just at a point in my life where it all made sense that i could make clothes where it was making a difference in people ’s lives with work that had never been attempted before			2
’ cool prints : ms @entity9 has included many contemporary prints in her designs to help consumers express their personas professional appearance : many of @entity8 's menswear designs are perfectly suited to the office in engineering the designs , ms @entity9 said that she had to revisit how clothes are even constructed			2
because many wheelchair users find it difficult to get clothes on and off she has largely used magnetic buttons , rather than conventional ones			1
similarly she has placed zippers in strategic places , like the front of a garment instead of the back or side			0
she has also chosen lightweight stretch fabrics that do n’t add bulk , as well as clothing silhouettes that will not awkwardly pool or drape when placed on a seated form			1
more than fashion : ms @entity9 says her work goes beyond clothes , and is about giving people their personality back but according to ms @entity9 , @entity8 ’s concept is about much more than just fashion			0
she said : ‘ it goes beyond the clothes , it ’s giving someone their personality back , their sense of inclusion – there just has n’t been anything like this			0

@entity8 , based in @entity48 , creates clothing *intended* for the seated form
it uses magnetic snaps and lightweight , stretch fabrics so that wheelchair users can have an easier time with getting clothing on and off
