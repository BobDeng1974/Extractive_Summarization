he has convinced devotees from @entity3 stars to @entity5 presidents that yoga should be performed in very hot temperatures by very sweaty students			1
but @entity9 has claimed she knows from bitter experience that multi-millionaire guru @entity11 can become fired up in a very different way			1
the pretty 24 - year - old alleges he pursued her for years and had implored fellow attendees at one of his training camps in 2008 not to leave her alone with him			0
fired up : @entity9 , right , has accused the millionaire founder of ' hot ' yoga @entity11 of sexual offences and is suing him but one night when , as usual , they all had to stay up with @entity11 and watch his favourite @entity22 films , she nodded off			1
she says she awoke to find her friends disappearing out of the door			0
' i grabbed my shoes and the door went click			0
i remember the click , ' she says			0
' i ran to the door			0
when i got to the door , he was on me			0
he was all over me			0
' she is one of four former students suing @entity11 , accusing him of sexual offences - rape in the case of three of the women			1
they claim the internationally renowned founder of @entity42 , or ' hot ' , yoga took advantage of the ' cult - like ' atmosphere in which they say he holds sway over his acolytes			1
@entity11 denies the allegations and has described the charges as ' false '			1
as yet , no court date has been set when he will defend his name			0
the women claim most of the alleged abuse took place at one of @entity11 's twice - yearly teacher - training retreats , which are compulsory for anyone who wants to teach @entity11 yoga			1
' cult - like ' atmosphere : devotees pay nearly £ 8,000 for a nine - week boot camp with @entity11 , who has compared himself to @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 devotees pay nearly £ 8,000 for a nine - week boot camp , staying at a @entity68 hotel and undergoing a regimen so gruelling that some people vomit , break down in tears or pass out			1
on top of that , they have to listen to rambling monologues from the man who , at 67 , conducts classes wearing tight black @entity78 swimming trunks and a jewel - encrusted @entity80 watch			0
@entity11 yoga consists of a series of 26 postures and two breathing exercises performed in a precise sequence for 90 minutes in a room heated to 105f			1
@entity11 , who says he saw the benefit of intense heat while teaching in his native @entity89 , maintains his yoga can even cure cancer and parkinson 's disease			1
the yogi , who claims to have been invited to the @entity5 in 1973 by president @entity94 to help him improve his health , says he has even taught @entity96 and @entity97			2
star fans of his form of yoga include @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			1
his global empire ( more than 600 yoga schools in 220 countries ) has made @entity11 a multi-millionaire , and a very flamboyant one at that			1
@entity112 : @entity11 's former legal adviser claims the guru routinely referred to women as ' bitches ' no loin cloth and bed of nails for him			1
he lives in a gaudy , 8,000 sq ft @entity121 mansion and owns dozens of @entity122 and @entity123			0
the diminutive yogi 's sartorial taste is pure @entity22 : tailor - made white leather suits , industrial quantities of bling and an obligatory entourage of stunning girls in skin - tight clothes			2
witnesses say he only needs to enter a room and his acolytes will bow down and put their hands together in prayer			0
miss @entity9 started @entity42 yoga in 2004 and , according to her lawsuit , was initially flattered by @entity11 's attentions ( he told her they knew each other in a past life )			1
he pursued her for years , eventually sabotaging her yoga career by discouraging studios from hiring her after she rejected him , she claims			2
on the night of their final encounter after the film screening , he pinned her against the door and groped her , she says			0
she escaped , but others , it is claimed , were not so fortunate			0
@entity151 , from @entity152 , started @entity42 yoga when she was 22 and became close to @entity11 because her boyfriend was one of his chief disciples			1
in her own lawsuit , she claims that one night after dinner , when @entity11 's wife and business partner @entity158 had gone to bed , he tried to kiss her			1
she rebuffed him but claims he raped her , causing her to go into ' trauma shock ' and simply freeze , unable to cry for help			0
she says she was terrified that her ' life would be over ' if she left @entity11 's close - knit community , so she remained but tried to keep her distance from him			1
in 2011 , she finally left the community after claiming he assaulted her again , this time trapping her against a wall as he pressed his body into hers			0
he got his revenge for her departure , she says , by refusing to recognise her studio as part of the @entity42 movement			2
two other women , identified in court papers simply as @entity176 1 and 2 , have made similar accusations against @entity11			1
@entity176 1 alleges that , during teacher - training in 2011 , he told her he had a ' gift ' for her because they ' thought the same ' and she had been ' touched by @entity181 '			0
one morning , when she was performing her assigned task of cleaning his hotel suite , he surprised her and forced her on to the bed , she claims			0
as she told him to stop , he repeatedly called her ' idiot '			0
she then makes an allegation that @entity11 forced her to perform oral sex and raped her			2
the woman said she had invested everything , financially and mentally , in becoming a @entity42 teacher and could n't afford to leave his community			2
pure @entity22 : the yogi , pictured with his wife @entity158 , left , enjoys tailor - made white leather suits and industrial quantities of bling she says he attacked her again in his room days later and ' remembers feeling that his sexual assaults were incestuous '			2
she eventually left with money lent by her mother and reported him to police three weeks after @entity201 filed her lawsuit			0
@entity176 2 was 21 when her boyfriend paid for her to attend a training retreat in 2010			0
when @entity11 started making sexual innuendos , she says she was offended but did n't want to waste her boyfriend 's hard - earned money by dropping out			1
she claims she rebuffed @entity11 's repeated attempts to seduce her until one night , as trainees sat through one of the mandatory @entity22 film screenings ( anyone who fell asleep was shaken awake by staff ) , he asked her to come up to his room to discuss her career			2
' do n't worry , we wo n't be alone , ' he allegedly told her			0
accuser : 24 - year - old @entity9 was once an acolyte of @entity11 's but is now taking action against him too late , she discovered he was lying and started to walk out			2
he implored her to stay , saying he needed to ' spiritually enlighten ' her , but to do that , they needed ' to become one ' , she says			0
the woman alleges he then raped her , even as she pleaded with him to stop			0
she says she considered going to police immediately , but her room - mate persuaded her to stay in training			0
the day after the attack , she says @entity11 regaled his class with a story about how women would rape him when he first moved to the @entity5 she ran out of the tent in tears			1
additional lawsuit : @entity151 says the yogi raped her she says @entity11 later insisted she sit next to him and his wife at her graduation dinner , taking her aside afterwards and warning her in no uncertain terms against crossing him			1
inevitably , questions have been asked as to why these women stayed in the community			2
' what did you think would happen in his hotel room ? you think he was going to help you with your standing - bow pose ? ' asked a @entity42 teacher who suggested the women used sex to get what they wanted			1
but the yogi 's woes are piling up			2
@entity11 is also being sued by his former legal adviser , @entity250 , who claims he threatened to have her deported after she insisted on investigating the allegations			1
she claims @entity11 is homophobic , racist and misogynistic , routinely referring to women as ' bitches '			1
neither @entity11 nor any of his official representatives have commented on the latest accusations , though in march he responded to one of the first lawsuits by saying he was ' disappointed by the false charges '			2
devotees say he has a superhuman ability to understand their past and see their future , and he has compared himself to @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
whether @entity11 's @entity263 - good or otherwise - will be much use in a court of law , however , remains to be seen .			2
