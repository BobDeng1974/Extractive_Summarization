by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 15:22 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 06:50 est , 6 november 2013 the mother of a four - year - old boy who died in a hospital embroiled in a cancer care cover - up has condemned the @entity9 trust ’s failings			1
@entity10 died of a brain tumour after a series of appalling delays to his treatment at @entity16			1
yesterday , a damning report into care at @entity16 revealed several patients like @entity10 may have died after enduring lengthy waiting times for treatment			1
poignant : @entity22 of @entity23 paid a bedside visit to @entity10 in march 2012 - two months before died of a brain tumour after a series of appalling delays to his treatment at @entity16 police have been called in over claims staff were ‘ pressured , bullied and harassed ’ by managers into covering up the extent of the crisis			1
two months before @entity10 died , a touching picture was taken of him with the @entity36 , who visited him in a nearby hospice			1
the extraordinary suggestion by the healthcare watchdog , the @entity40 , is that officials falsified data to make it look as if crucial targets were met			2
some desperately ill patients were forced to wait up to four months for urgent cancer care			1
last night @entity10 ’s mother @entity47 said it was ‘ terrifying ’ to think how many cancer patients might have suffered			1
‘ the thing is , it was n’t just @entity10 , ’ she said			2
what else will come out of the woodwork ? it is scary			0
’ series of blunders : @entity10 with his father @entity58 and his mother @entity47			2
they believe their son may still be alive today had it not been for delays to his diagnosis and treatment for cancer at the hospital @entity69 has admitted making ‘ administrative errors ’ in @entity10 ’s case which meant crucial appointments were never made and the little boy ’s diagnosis and treatment was delayed			1
but it was only yesterday – after the publication of the damning report – that the family from @entity80 , @entity81 , learned that the problems went much deeper			1
the @entity40 said the records of 22 patients had been changed to cover up the fact they had faced ‘ extensive ’ delays for treatment – which could have put their lives at risk			1
some were facing delays of almost four months for life - saving treatment			1
government guidelines state patients should wait no longer than 31 days for surgery , chemotherapy or radiotherapy after their doctor has decided on the best course of treatment			1
the investigation also found that staff had been ‘ pressured , bullied and harassed ’ to change figures on cancer waiting times to meet government targets			1
this is the text of the letter from the @entity36 after she learned of @entity10 ’s death : @entity110 and @entity47 i was so desperately sorry to hear the devastating news about @entity10 ’s death			1
it was an incredible honour to have met @entity10 when i came to @entity114 earlier this year , and i was totally bowled over by his courage , his strength of spirit , and his brilliant sense of humour			2
i will remember very fondly his love of @entity122 , and his gorgeous smile , which never seemed to leave his @entity124 have my deepest and most heartfelt condolences , @entity126 @entity10 ’s parents believe he may still be alive had it not been for delays to his diagnosis and treatment			1
miss @entity47 took @entity10 to the @entity134 department in september 2010 because he was vomiting and complaining of headaches			2
but although he was given blood tests and an x-ray , no follow - up appointments were made			0
further administrative blunders led to a crucial scan of his head and spine being delayed for four weeks and he was eventually diagnosed with cancer in february 2011 – seven months after first going to the gp			2
and when his symptoms returned in september 2011 , doctors initially dismissed them as unrelated and sent him home			0
he was diagnosed with the secondary tumour in january 2012 after he woke up paralysed – within four months he was dead			2
just two months before he died in may last year , @entity10 was visited by the @entity36 at his hospice			1
she was said to have been ‘ touched ’ by his plight , and after he died she wrote a moving letter of condolence to his family , telling them she had been ‘ desperately sorry ’ to hear of his death			2
‘ @entity10 is just another statistic as far as the hospital is concerned , ’ miss @entity47 said in february			2
‘ the treatment by @entity69 has caused so much upset and guilt			0
they have avoided blame and it ’s unacceptable			0
’ at risk : staff at @entity16 said they were ' pressured ' into changing patients ' data to imply they were treated within national guideline ' shocking ' : sir @entity171 , left , chief inspector of hospitals , urged monitor , the foundation hospitals watchdog , to put @entity175 in special measures			2
trust chief executive @entity177 , right , issued an apology to patients who did not receive the ' high quality of care they should have expected ' the @entity40 found that at least three of the 22 patients whose records were changed waited more than 100 days for treatment , including one who waited 126 days			1
although @entity10 is not one of the patients identified in the report , the hospital has launched a separate investigation into his death over concerns that ‘ administrative errors ’ led to delays in diagnosis and treatment			1
patients suspected of having cancer who have been referred by their gp should wait a maximum of two weeks to see a specialist , according to the @entity9 cancer strategy set out in 2011			1
cancer patients should wait no more than 31 days from the decision to treat their cancer to the start of their first treatment , such as chemotherapy , which should then be delivered within the following 31 days			1
this means all patients should wait no more than 62 days from their urgent gp referral to the completion of the first phase of their treatment			1
when hospitals are unable to treat patients within the target timeframe they have a duty to investigate and offer alternative hospitals			0
professor sir @entity171 , the government ’s chief inspector of hospitals who is based at the @entity40 , said : ‘ it is shocking to think that people ’s lives may have been put at risk for the sake of the waiting time figures			2
' if you are diagnosed with cancer you are entitled to think that your hospital will do all they can to ensure you get treatment you need as soon as possible			0
’ the @entity40 spoke to three members of staff who were asked by bosses to change figures on waiting times			1
sir @entity171 has urged monitor , the watchdog for foundation hospitals , to put the @entity243 in special measures which would see it being taken over by a hit squad			0
if @entity240 agrees , the organisation will become the eighth foundation trust to be taken over following concerns of poor care			0
it is rare for the @entity40 to refer a hospital trust to the police and they are called in to investigate only the most serious cases			1
trust chief executive dr @entity177 said : ‘ we are very concerned by the findings of the @entity40 report			2
' we are truly sorry that in some cases cancer patients , their carers and families have not always received the high quality of care that they should have expected from our trust			1
’ speaking on the @entity268 radio 4 today programme , @entity265 , @entity266 's national secretary for health , said union members blew the whistle			0
she said : ' they were admin workers , bullied by managers into falsifying data			0
' i think this is serious enough that it does merit a police investigation			0
' we think there should be police investigation – and a complete change in way junior members of staff are spoken to			0
this is about people in every pay grade in hospital speaking out when things go wrong			0
' @entity292 , mp for @entity293 , added : ' the chief executive was aware of whistle blower , and thought it had been dealt with			0
he deeply regrets and apologises for the fact he did n’t personally pursue it			0
' why have we got a health service in which people feel justified falsifying records to make things seem better ? ' we must n’t replace values with targets			0
‘ this is a terrible indictment of the culture that has grown up in the health service over a long time			0
‘ there 's no escaping from the fact that this is completely inexcusable , everyone acknowledges that			0
' @entity16 chief executive @entity177 said it was ' regrettable ' that a 2012 internal review failed to address the issues			0
' this report is awful reading			0
i want to apologise to patients because we have let them down by having these delays , ' he told @entity81			0
' yes , there was an investigation carried out by two members of my executive team at the time - in february of 2012 - and that review was not adequate			0
' it was n't robust enough and it did n't go deep enough and that is regrettable			0
' if you or your family had concerns about your treatment at @entity69 or suffered bullying by managers there please email news@dailymail.co.uk or telephone 0203 615 1154 .			0
