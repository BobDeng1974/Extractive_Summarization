this is the moment the carer for an elderly woman with @entity2 was caught on a hidden camera stuffing stolen £ 10 notes into her bra			1
@entity6 , 33 , of @entity7 , @entity8 , was secretly filmed stealing the money from her 90 - year - old client , @entity10 , earlier this year			1
the victim 's children @entity11 , @entity14 and @entity15 , had installed a small camera in their mother 's home after they noticed money going missing from a secure cash box in the kitchen			1
@entity6 , 33 , was secretly filmed stealing two £ 10 notes from her client , 90 - year - old @entity10 the box was kept locked with a key that was hidden in a separate location			1
during both incidents , on june 13 and july 7 this year , a £ 10 note was taken by @entity6			1
the carer denied everything in her police interview , swearing on her ' nan and granddad 's ashes ' she had never taken cash out of the box			1
however , @entity37 heard @entity6 completely changed her story when police told her she had been caught taking the money on film			1
she then claimed she had bought milk , bread and toilet cleaner for her client and gave mrs @entity10 the leftover change to put in her purse			0
in the video @entity6 is seen taking the box out of a cupboard and unlocking it with the key while making small talk with someone in another room			2
she then puts the box back in the cupboard and turns away from the camera , stuffing something into her bra before resuming her conversation			2
giving evidence mr @entity15 said : ' i left £ 30 cash in there , on june 11			0
a couple of days later , on june 13 , i found £ 20 in the box			2
' on july 7 , again i checked the box			0
there was £ 35 in there and when i checked the box later that day £ 10 was missing			1
' quite a lot of material we were buying for her went missing at the time as well			0
' her children kept receipts in the box and all knew exactly how much was in there and when things had been bought for their mother			2
mrs @entity10 's children set up the secret camera in the kitchen after money started to go missing - she is pictured here taking the box out of the cupboard before she unlocked it and stole £ 10 prosecutor @entity89 said : ' the prosecution would like to draw your attention to the fact that when @entity6 was taxed about the matter she had no recollection but when she saw the @entity98 there was an admission and indeed the extent of detail			1
' no note was left inside the box to say ' i had to take money ' or change			0
' it is unlikely on both occasions that exactly £ 10 was spent			1
' @entity6 had been mrs @entity10 's regular carer since october 2013			2
she would spend 45 minutes with mrs @entity10 , make her a sandwich and a cup of tea and give her medication			0
she told the court she only took the money to buy things for mrs @entity10			1
when asked by magistrates why she initially denied taking money , @entity6 began crying			2
she said : ' i was frightened			0
my head was all over the place			0
i did n't know what i was saying			0
' @entity37 @entity37 ( pictured ) heard @entity6 completely changed her story when police told her she had been caught taking the money on film - she was found guilty of stealing the two £ 10 notes she said she had been humiliated when police arrested her in the street and added : ' i was there to help a client out			1
i 'm not some kind of thief			0
i would never do that			0
' @entity6 was found guilty of two counts of theft on thursday			1
district judge @entity137 said : ' it seems strange to me that if the money had been taken and used quite legitimately that it would be so dramatically forgotten			0
' i 'm driven to conclude and i 'm driven to infer it really is n't possible for the [ police ] interview to have progressed in the way that it did with flat denial and acceptance			0
' it can not be that was genuine forgetfulness and i 'm driven to conclude miss @entity6 did steal the two amounts of £ 10			1
i find both charges proved			0
' @entity6 will be sentenced on monday morning .			2
