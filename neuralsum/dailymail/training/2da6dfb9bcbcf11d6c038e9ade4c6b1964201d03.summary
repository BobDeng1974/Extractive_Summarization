by @entity0 published : 04:27 est , 6 may 2012 updated : 08:37 est , 6 may 2012 in retreat : @entity2 is expected to put on hold his plans to legalise gay marriage and modernise the @entity5 @entity2 is expected to put on hold his plans to legalise gay marriage and modernise the @entity5 after his party 's miserable showing in local elections sparked a backlash from angry @entity11 backbenchers			1
the prime minister wants to make same - sex weddings lawful and to reform the system of unelected peers			1
but he is expected to make only a vague pledge to reform the @entity5 in this week 's @entity18 's speech , avoiding any firm commitments to implement the policy			1
mr @entity2 is also understood to be ready to put the gay marriage plans on the backburner			1
the retreat comes after conservative mps called on mr @entity2 to return to traditional @entity11 values following thursday 's elections , in which the party lost 12 councils and 405 seats			2
@entity31 sources say the prime minister has recognised that he can not push ahead with the controversial plans with support for the party waning			1
@entity36 today indicated the reforms were being kicked into the long grass			2
the chancellor said he had taken the message from voters that ministers should be focusing ' on the things that really matter ' rather than getting ' distracted ' by too many other issues			1
mr @entity36 said he was personally in favour of gay marriage but he denied there had been plans to bring forward a @entity49 in the @entity18 's speech			1
he said the party was committed in its manifesto to ' looking ' at @entity53 but it was ' not the priority of the government '			2
mr @entity36 added that the government would " learn " from the verdict delivered at the ballot box on thursday			1
he told @entity60 's the @entity59 : ' i think what people are saying is focus on the things that really matter , focus on the economy and on education and welfare			1
' focus on those things , do n't get distracted by too many other issues			2
' controversial : dissent is growing among backbench @entity11 mps about the prime minister 's plans to allow gay couples to wed mr @entity36 said it was clearly ' not the case ' that voters had deserted the @entity11 in the elections as a result of gay marriage proposals or @entity53			1
but he said that while @entity83 would debate the planned shake - up of the upper chamber , it was not a ' priority '			0
he added : ' we are focused on the really important issues that matter to people			1
' @entity83 can discuss these issues , @entity83 is very good at discussing these issues , but it is certainly not my priority , the priority of the government			2
' it is not where the efforts of the government and the executive are going to be directed			2
' pressure grew on mr @entity2 within the party after @entity103 managed to overturn a 19 - point @entity105 lead to secure re-election as @entity108 mayor			0
mr @entity103 emphasised his right - wing credentials during the successful campaign and attacked the government for its record on traditional @entity11 concerns such as immigration , tax cuts and @entity116			0
the mayor 's victory prompted calls for mr @entity2 to rein in ' wind turbine @entity120 ' and concentrate on the issues of most importance to conservative voters			2
backtrack : @entity36 told @entity59 that the party was committed in its manifesto to ' looking ' at @entity53 but it was ' not the priority of the government ' right - wing @entity11 mps led by @entity131 and @entity132 believe a more radical economic strategy is needed to tackle the country 's problems			1
they are in favour of targeted tax cuts , deeper spending cuts and an end to expensive environmental regulation			0
with such concern over the government 's direction , mr @entity2 's plans to modernise the @entity5 and allow gay couples to wed risk angering backbench @entity130 even more			1
a @entity31 source told the @entity149 : ' gay marriage is something we genuinely want to do , but because of everything that has happened now is not the time			0
' priorities : @entity156 says @entity157 are ' screaming out ' for strong policies on law and order , a stable @entity161 and an in - out referendum on @entity116 it is understood that @entity164 , chairman of the @entity11 backbench 1922 committee , will hold talks with mr @entity2 and urge him to pursue policies for growth and increased flexibility in the jobs market			0
the committee 's executive will also meet chief whip @entity173 and warn him about the dissent among @entity11 mps and voters about gay marriage and @entity53			2
@entity178 , secretary of the committee , said the party 's council election defeat was not due to ' mid-term blues ' - the dip in support often seen by governments halfway through their time in power			0
' it would be high risk to continue to take our natural supporters in the country and the party for granted , ' mr @entity178 said			0
' if the public believe our priorities are not their priorities , and it sticks , no amount of relaunches will suffice			0
' @entity11 mp @entity199 , who last month branded mr @entity2 and chancellor @entity36 ' arrogant posh boys ' , has also called for a change in direction			1
criticism : cardinal @entity204 accused mr @entity2 of attempting to ' redefine marriage ' for a ' small minority of activists ' she said : ' while @entity157 scream out for strong policies on law and order , a stable @entity161 and an in - out referendum on @entity116 to cut us free from basket - case @entity215 economies , @entity2 makes gay marriage and @entity53 his priorities			0
' even those who have no deep understanding of economics recognise that we need a strategy for growth , lower taxes , enterprise schemes to help local entrepreneurs , free - flowing bank capital and raising tax thresholds for the lower paid			0
' mr @entity2 's support for gay marriage is particularly controversial			2
in march cardinal @entity204 accused him of attempting to ' redefine marriage ' for a ' small minority of activists '			0
defeat : the retreat comes after the @entity11 suffered heavy losses in local elections			0
@entity105 , led by @entity236 , made gains @entity204 insisted that the reforms would â€˜ shame the @entity157 in the eyes of the world '			0
mr @entity2 is believed to have warmed to the idea of a referendum on @entity53 , which could be held as late as 2015			0
the queen 's speech is expected to underline the importance of the family and to include a bill to reform maternity and parental leave			1
other proposals to promote marriage and family life are likely to include the offer of extra support for couples who are about to break up			1
divorced fathers could be given more rights to care for their children , except in domestic violence cases			0
tough measures on crime are also expected , along with a bill on banking reform .			0

@entity5 reform also to be put on hold by the prime minister
chancellor @entity36 promises that the government will focus instead on the ' really important issues that matter to people '
