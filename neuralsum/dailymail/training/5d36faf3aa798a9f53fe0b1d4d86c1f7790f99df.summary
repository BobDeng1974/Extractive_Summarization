the children who survive often can not communicate because of brain damage and stare listlessly , unable to recognize friends they played with just months before			2
some are so severely disabled that their impoverished parents are told to abandon them many families have taken out crushing loans for treatment			0
@entity14 's four - year - old son @entity16 has been in a hospital for four months			1

killer : while @entity3 's efforts against polio and tuberculosis get plenty of attention , the poor farmers and day laborers of eastern @entity22 state face an almost - silent health emergency , battling a disease that has killed thousands of children over the past eight years every year the monsoon fills the region 's parched paddy fields , heralding the arrival of the mosquitoes that spread @entity73 encephalitis from pigs to humans , devastating malnourished children with low immunity			1
another strain of the disease - @entity79 - spreads through contaminated water			1
residents use the fields for defecation , contaminating the ground water			0
a vaccine has long been available , but the state government - which spent tens of millions of dollars building monuments to its last top politician - has failed to muster the sustained political will to focus on the communities hardest hit by the illness			2
the disease killed more than 1,500 children in 2005 , the worst recent year			1
errors : health experts say the government has made repeated mistakes in the fight against encephalitis encephalitis is a mosquito - borne disease			1

most people infected by the @entity73 encephalitis virus do not develop any symptoms , or they get only mild , flu - like symptoms			1
but in people who are seriously infected the virus can also cause swelling inside the brain ( encephalitis ) , leading to increased pressure in the brain			2
this can cause permanent brain damage			0
the devastating disease can be fatal in around one in three people who develop these serious symptoms			2
source : @entity131 shocked by the deaths , @entity22 's highest court in 2006 asked the state and federal governments to declare encephalitis a national health emergency			0

last year , more than 700 children died			1
health experts say the government has made repeated mistakes in the fight against encephalitis			0
most of the 7.5 million children vaccinated between 2006 and 2010 were given only a single dose of a two - dose vaccine , said @entity11 , of the @entity12			1
' who is responsible for the children who died between 2006 and 2010 ? ' @entity11 asked			0
in 2010 the vaccination drive suddenly stopped because funds dried up			0
the sanitation drive never fully started			0
to make matters worse , in the 23 worst - affected districts in the state , only one hospital - the @entity171 in @entity20 - is equipped to deal with the hundreds of sick children			1
they fill its 108 - bed encephalitis ward			1
' by the time they reach here , it 's too late , ' said dr. @entity183 , who heads the hospital			0
according to hospital data , 5,136 children with encephalitis died in its wards between 2005 and 2012			2
