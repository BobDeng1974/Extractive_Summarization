@entity0 managed to keep her hair whilst having chemotherapy for breast cancer with not one , but two , requests to be a bridesmaid for close friends , @entity0 had every intention of looking her absolute best as she walked down the aisle at each wedding			1
and a major preoccupation was what to do with her hair			2
her concern went beyond which style to go for			2
facing gruelling chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer , her worry was whether she would have any hair at all			1
' as a cancer patient , your first concern is : ' will this disease kill me ? ' ' , explains @entity24 , 30 , an advertising manager who lives in @entity26 with her boyfriend			1
' but what can make things so much harder is the fact that when you lose your hair , you look like a cancer patient			2
i did n't want pitying looks			2
' i did n't want anyone who was n't close to me knowing i had the disease or was undergoing treatment			2
when you look normal , you feel so much better			2
it 's such a morale boost to go out and find no one treats you any differently			2
' with the weddings looming just months after she started chemotherapy in may , @entity24 was persuaded to try ' scalp cooling ' to help her retain her shoulder length , strawberry blonde hair			1
chemotherapy works by attacking rapidly dividing cells - that is , cancer cells			1
however , healthy cells that also divide rapidly can be affected , including cells in the stomach ( which is why chemo can cause nausea ) , and the hair follicles - the tiny openings in the skin that produce hair			1
if the amount of chemotherapy drugs reaching the follicles can be reduced - especially during the peak period of treatment a couple of hours after chemo has started - there is a chance the hair is less likely to fall out , explains dr @entity68 , a consultant clinical oncologist at @entity69			1
scalp cooling or ' cold cap ' treatment involves wearing a lightweight silicone cap that 's connected to either a small refrigeration unit or filled with a liquid cooling gel , both of which can reduce the temperature of the scalp to around -4c , to reduce blood flow to the scalp			1
the cold cap is placed on the patient 's head about an hour before chemotherapy begins - it 's worn throughout the session while the drug is being given , as well as for an hour afterwards as the drugs may still be circulating in the blood ( there are no long - term health effects but some users may experience headaches )			1
she wore a lightweight silicone cap which can reduce the temperature of the scalp to around -4c the treatment is n't guaranteed to stop hair falling out - and even for patients who keep the majority of their hair , some follicles can still be damaged by the chemo drugs , leading to some hair loss , or thinning hair			1
the cap is worn during each chemo session - @entity24 had the treatment during all six rounds of her chemotherapy , for four hours a time , over four - and - a - half months - and it worked			1
she was able to wear her hair long for one of the weddings , and up for the other			2
' i just loved every moment being a bridesmaid , ' she says			2
' my boyfriend says he would love me any way i looked , but it meant so much to me that we could go on dates and that i could feel pretty			2
' it may not be for everyone			2
but for me it meant i could go on with day - to - day life without being reminded that i had cancer			2
' research published by the @entity130 found that 47 per cent of female patients considered hair loss the most traumatic aspect of chemotherapy			1
yet according to the breast cancer charity walk the walk , which has been raising money to place scalp coolers in all @entity141 hospitals , many are unaware this technology exists , even though it 's available in many areas ( although there are n't enough devices nationally to offer all patients who might need them )			1
there needs to be far greater encouragement of the use of the cold cap , where appropriate , adds @entity152 , professor of cancer medicine at @entity153 , @entity26			1
' we need to raise awareness that it 's the little things that make people feel better			0
' it 's something women should at least be given the option of trying , since clearly in some cases it does work and with minimal additional cost to the hospital , ' he says			0
for patients who keep the majority of their hair , some follicles can still be damaged by the chemo drugs when @entity172 , 37 , a mother - of - four from @entity173 , had chemotherapy for breast cancer last year , she says she was n't given any encouragement to use the cold cap - though she knew about it after researching on the internet			1
' i was told that for every symptom i had such as nausea , the hospital could help me - with the exception of hair loss , ' she says			0
' when i broached the cold cap , i was shown it in a cupboard and told by the breast care nurses : ' you do n't really want to use that			1
it 's so freezing cold and it 's not always effective			0
so why put yourself through it ? ' ' in fact , a 2012 review of 1,411 breast cancer patients found that around 50 per cent retained enough hair during their treatment that they did n't feel the need to cover their heads			0
@entity172 continues : ' at the time , i was feeling pretty vulnerable and looking back i simply did n't have the determination to pursue the cold cap			1
so i lost my hair after the second session , which was awful			0
your morale just drops through the floor and it was frightening for my children			0
' it would have been nice if someone could have encouraged me to at least try it			0
' the cold cap is n't suitable for patients whose disease is at an advanced stage and has spread significantly , says dr @entity68			1
' there is a very remote chance that cancer cells may have escaped to the scalp and if you cool the scalp they could be sheltered there			1
and in theory , once the treatment stops , the cancer cells could move and grow elsewhere			0
' for similar reasons , it 's not used for patients with blood cancers , such as leukaemia , as the cancer is circulating around the body			0
nor is it suitable for those having continuous chemotherapy over several days , as it 's impractical to keep the scalp cooler on so long			1
@entity24 had the treatment during all six rounds of her chemotherapy - and it worked @entity24 had never heard of the cold cap until she was diagnosed with grade 3 aggressive cancer having noticed a thickening in her right breast a few months earlier			1
' it was a terrible shock as i was young , fit and there was no disease in my family , ' she says			0
' there was so much to take in , but among the things i read was something about the cold cap			1
' i 've always had a lot of hair , and at the @entity260 , where i was due to have my chemotherapy , they were very encouraging of using the cold cap			1
' the treatment was n't entirely comfortable , she says : ' it was absolutely freezing - almost like a burning sensation , or that kind of ' brain freeze ' feeling you get when you eat very cold food			0
' despite having a heating pad and heavy blankets for her four - hour treatment , she was still ' desperately cold , and my head felt like a block of ice , but i coped '			0
@entity24 's hair did become a little thinner , but not noticeably so			0
so why is n't the cold cap more widely used ? a review found that around 50 per cent retained enough hair using a scalp cooler , such as the one pictured professor @entity152 says it may be because patients have to spend longer in the chemotherapy department and some departments do n't have the capacity as there are too many patients			1
also , he says : ' it can be painful and uncomfortable and perhaps that deters some centres from encouraging use of it			0
' and when it does n't work , the disappointment can be crushing			0
when @entity298 , 44 , a sales assistant from @entity299 , @entity300 , was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 , the first thing she asked her oncologist was whether she would lose her hair			0
told that she would , she immediately asked about the cold cap , having heard about it from a friend			2
' the hospital was happy for me to give it a try			0
their approach was , well we doubt it 'll work , but have a go			0
' it was horrendous , i had absolute brain freeze it was so cold			0
i kept thinking i ca n't do this			0
but i persisted through the session , which went on for about four hours			0
' i was due to have more chemo three weeks later , but after week one , my hair began to fall out			0
i was so disheartened , i did n't have the energy or fight to carry on and see if it would make a difference			0
' however @entity24 was more than happy with the results : ' it helped so much knowing that despite the treatment i was keeping my hair			0

@entity0 , 30 , from @entity26 was persuaded to try ' scalp cooling '
lightweight silicone cap can be filled with a liquid cooling gel
helps reduce the amount of chemotherapy drugs reaching the follicles
