@entity14 was developed by @entity8 designer , @entity19			2
@entity19 said : ‘ curiosity makes us explore the world			0
' we all get improved because of curiosity , including babies			0
[ babies are ] curious to everything and make the most progress during the exploration [ in both ] brain and body			2
‘ @entity14 makes use of light and sound to provide an interactive experience for babies			2
in the second mode - designed for more competent crawlers - the light moves away as the child approaches it			0
the child then has to chase the light around the rug , and music will only play when the child hits it ' its flashing led light attracts a baby 's curiosity so it [ wants ] to crawl to touch the light area			1
' ' after they reach the area , @entity14 plays music as feedback to enhance the joy of the whole experience			1
' according to research , crawling helps a lot for babies ’ development both brain and body			1
’ dr @entity169 told @entity170 : ' crawling is an important part of a baby 's development			2
it is part of the process that allows young children to map their world			0
' it is not only an important part of their physical development but also their mental development as it significantly increases their appetite for discovery and piques their curiosity as they become more mobile and therefore better able to explore their environment			0
' crawling is also the natural pre-cursor to their next stage of physical development - standing and walking			0
another winner of the @entity17 was @entity198 , pictured			2
it has a double gelatinous membrane made using sodium alginate and calcium chloride			0
the spheres are created using gelification and its creators said the final package is ' cheap , hygienic and biodegradable ' ' to be honest i am not sure most babies need any encouragement to crawl as it happens quite naturally , however i am sure they would enjoy the flashing lights and noises ! ' prototypes of the concept are expected to be made later this year , but a release date and price have not been announced yet			1
