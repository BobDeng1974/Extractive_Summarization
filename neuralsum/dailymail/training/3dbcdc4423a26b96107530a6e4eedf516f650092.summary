by @entity0 published : 09:12 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 11:38 est , 18 march 2014 a seaside ' land train ' run by the same family for 46 years has been scrapped by a local council , so it can instead put its own trains on the route			1
the novelty attraction near @entity9 - thought to be the first of its kind in the country - was hand - built in 1968 by @entity13 and is still run by his 88 - year - old widow @entity14			1
but more than 17,000 people have protested after @entity16 told the pensioner it would not renew her licence for the three motorised trains in november			1
outrage : @entity20 , 88 ( pictured ) has been told she will no longer be able to run the ' land trains ' introduced by her late husband 46 years ago - so @entity16 can run its own service instead hitting the buffers : the council told mrs @entity20 its decision is final despite a petition signed by thousands popular : the train runs every hour at @entity31 beach , pictured , which has 350 upmarket beach huts all aboard : mrs @entity20 employs five drivers and a mechanic on her set of three novelty land trains instead the council will run its own ' land trains ' on the one - and - a - half mile path from @entity40 to @entity31 beach in @entity42			1
the council claims its trains will be better because they will have 50 per cent more seats , disabled access and modern engines with lower emissions			1
they will also eventually run directly along a six - mile route from the beauty spot to @entity9 seafront , once they link up with the trains the council already runs			1
but fans of the current trains , which have eight carriages each , criticised the ' insensitive ' news - which was delivered to mrs @entity20 on the same day her grandson died			1
a petition calling on the council to keep the current service , which locals affectionately nicknamed the @entity66 train in 1960s as an adaptation of its original name of ' toy town train ' , has gained more than 17,000 signatures in a few days			1
it was also given a mention by @entity77 breakfast radio presenter @entity75 today , who said : ' i just feel sorry for the @entity80 and the people that run it and the kids that enjoy it			2
' history : @entity20 with her late husband @entity86 with one of their trains in the 1970s			2
she said the train was her ' life ' and she runs it more as a hobby than to turn any profit			2
there are fears that fares could go up the first train , pictured when it launched , was built by mr @entity13 with the help of driver @entity99 , pictured			1
cheery : the hand - built trains , pictured in 1977 , were thought to be the first of their kind in the country the good old days : an early version of the train when its engine more resembled a ride - on lawnmower despite the council promising to freeze fares at their current level for the next year , day trippers fear they will then rise sharply so the authority can turn a profit			1
mrs @entity20 - who employs five drivers and a mechanic - said she makes almost no money from the trains , which she runs every half hour charging £ 1.20 for an adult one - way ticket			1
a full - day fare on the council 's trains costs £ 5 or £ 18 for a family			2
however , a spokesman said a one - way ticket on the same route would be frozen for a year			2
support : @entity77 breakfast radio presenter @entity75 said he felt sorry for the train staff mrs @entity20 said : ' i had no idea they were planning this			1
i thought the council were going to renew the contract like they do every year			0
' i was n’t in a very good state at the time because i found out my grandson had died and i told the people from the council that but they went ahead with the meeting			0
' i could n’t take it in at and i was n’t ready for it and just agreed with them			0
' i do n’t have the words to describe how i am feeling			0
really it ’s just disgraceful and a total shock			1
' the train is my life and i have run it more as a hobby than a business			0
' the current profit margins are such that you would have to have another job because you ca n’t make a living out of it			0
' @entity158 , 51 , who has been the land train mechanic for 22 years , said : ' if the council are n’t shamed by this they ought to be			1
i feel we have been stabbed in the back			0
' someone who has spent 45 years working with them deserves more respect than has been shown here			0
' he said mrs @entity20 had continued investing in the trains , replacing the carriages and buying new parts as recently as last year			1
' the council say they 'll offer us a transfer but i 'll refuse out of principle , ' he told @entity177			0
' they can offer me whatever they want but i 'm not joining them			0
' it 's fantastic that we 've had so much support but i do n't think the council will change their mind			0
they 've done things despite public protests before			0
' iconic : the train has been a @entity9 tourist attraction for 46 years and features in postcards scenic : another postcard shows the train on a summer 's day while holidaymakers ride animals alongside affectionate : the origins of the @entity66 train 's nickname came when it was originally named a ' toy town train '			2
its official name is the @entity40 land train scenic : the train carries passengers to the pedestrian - only beach at @entity210 , pictured devoted : mrs @entity20 still runs the service along this stretch of coastline 364 days a year at the age of 88 mr @entity13 built the train after the council called on people to find an alternative way of travelling to the beauty spot , which was overrun with cars			1
his construction was believed to have been the first novelty land train in the country			2
the engineer was granted a one year trial and the service was deemed so successful he continued running it until his death in 1980			0
mrs @entity20 then took over the running and still works in the office today			1
the train also takes visitors and the owners of 350 exclusive beach huts to the @entity31 sandbank			2
one resident posted on an internet forum : ' my family have been using the train for years			0
my mum went on it as a girl , i did and now my children			0
it is more valuable than numbers on a spreadsheet			0
' it is also very disrespectful to the lady who has dedicated her life to running it			0
where is the morality in this decision , some things are more important than money			0
' happy memories : @entity86 and @entity20 , together far right , with staff members in the 1970s on track : the train had a party to mark its 40th anniversary in 2008			2
right , @entity13 and mrs @entity20 in the 1970s derailed : mrs @entity20 said she received the shocking news shortly after discovering her grandson had died @entity9 council 's cabinet member for tourism , @entity267 , claimed mrs @entity20 had agreed to the closure and derided the online petition because those signing it had not given their addresses			1
he told the @entity273 : ' if they want us to take the petition seriously , they should take the names and addresses of people who live in @entity9 , as we do not know where these people are from			0
' the council also denied its 5.5ft - wide trains will struggle to pass each other on the 10ft - wide path , and said rumours that the train will be branded by @entity287 are untrue			2
in a statement , he added : ' the existing land train service at @entity40 has served the area well for a number of years and i would like to thank mrs @entity20 for her dedicated work during this time			1
' with the current licence set to expire and after much consideration we feel that the time is right for the council to take ownership of the service			0

@entity13 hand - built a ' land train ' at @entity42 's @entity31 beach in 1968
his 88 - year - old widow @entity14 still runs the service *34* years after he died
now she has been given notice to leave by @entity16
it says new trains have disabled access , lower emissions and longer route
fares will be frozen for the first year but there is no *guarantee* after that
petition has been signed by 17,000 and supported by @entity77 's @entity75
mrs @entity20 said : ' it ’s just disgraceful and a total shock . the train is my life '
