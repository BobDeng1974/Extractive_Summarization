high heels may make you feel sexy but — and it ’s a big but — they often fail the most basic of shoe requirements : to get you from a to @entity5 according to top shoe designer @entity6 , whose fans include the @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , there ’s a radical solution : ditch heels , because flat shoes can actually look far better			1
and she knows what she ’s talking about : @entity6 was the designer who finally got @entity8 out of her famous @entity18 nude heels and into a pair of tasselled @entity21 riding boots			1
‘ you simply walk taller in flats , ’ @entity6 says			1
‘ you feel comfortable in them , so you ’re able to walk with more confidence , keeping your spine straight , so giving you better posture			1
‘ @entity29 , they work for every occasion ; i ’m 5ft 2in and i wear them everywhere — even to weddings			1
’ to show just how versatile flats can be , here @entity6 picks some of the best designs around this season and matches them with the outfits that show them off best			1
the stretch panel makes them easy to pull on , and means you have a bit of give for comfort			2
they have a small , 5cm heel that lifts you very slightly , but means you can still leap about			2
wear them with jeans , trousers , skirts just below the knee or maxi dresses			2

these metallic flats from @entity69 are covered in jewels and are beautifully elegant , thanks to the pointed toe			1
they will look fabulous against a tan , and work just as well during the day as at evening events			0

look out for gems , bright colours and unusual shapes			0
this great pair of patent pumps are slick and chic with a very slight gold heel , which will give you a lift , while still being practical			1
they are smart enough for work , but still feminine , thanks to the front bow detail			0
@entity100 will be one of the colours this winter , and looks great against black and grey			0
shoes , £ 195 , russellandbromley.co.uk dress , £ 79 , @entity106 , 020 7629 9161 bag , £ 109 , zara.com @entity107 most people opt for ballet pumps when dressing down			0
but slippers , with a leather sole and slightly higher heel , are a better , more supportive option			0
these smoking slippers are velvet with a leather tassel and look smart , yet relaxed			0
a @entity118 exhibition about @entity119 , among others , inspired me to design them			0
worn with or without socks , they are a useful , neutral shoe that should match with most of your wardrobe — yes , they ’re more expensive , but they ’ll last you a lifetime			1
loafers , £ 249 , penelopechilvers.com striped top , £ 39.50 , marksandspencer.com jeans , £ 40 , topshop.com @entity135 a pale pink or nude shoe lengthens the appearance of your legs , unlike black or coloured shoes , which seem to cut you off at the ankle			2
these have a small heel in the same colour as the body of the shoe to give subtle height without being noticeable or uncomfortable			0
simple flats , like these , look good next to a print dress as they let it do the talking			2

why , though , when we will be on our feet all day ? embellished sandals can look just as good and are formal enough for the occasion , so long as you take care to look after your toes			0
again , pair with a statement necklace			2
