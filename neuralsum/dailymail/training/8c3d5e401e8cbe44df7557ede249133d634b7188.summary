the sluice gate at @entity24 had been padlocked shut in a bid to prevent further flooding to the levels ‘ properties in @entity17 were already at risk			0
because the defendant opened the gate there was an increase of water levels			0
‘ it transpired that mr @entity0 was boasting at a @entity74 that he had opened the gates			1
’ mr @entity51 told the court that it was unclear how much of the blame for flooding in @entity17 could be placed with @entity0			2
he added : ‘ the area was flooded anyway			0
the gates exacerbated the problem			0
’ @entity0 used a crowbar to wedge them open in an effort to stop his own home from being flooded last year the 40 - year - old said if the gates remained shut his home ( pictured ) would have been swamped with water and waste but residents say opening the sluice gate led to devastating consequences			1
@entity95 believes his 99 - year - old father @entity97 ’s house was flooded as a result of the gate being lifted			1
‘ i believe my father is not in his house today because of the actions of this man in @entity24 , ’ he said earlier this year			2
@entity104 , is unlikely to return to his home until april			0
another flooded resident , @entity105 , added : ‘ it could have been a matter of centimetres that saved us			0
‘ if we had n’t have had that extra water that the sluice gate being opened caused into the floodwater that was already there , we may well have just got away with it , but we did n’t			2
’ @entity115 magistrates ’ court heard @entity0 opened the 4.4ft square gates used to control the flow of water between december 20 and 23 last year			1
dozens of homes were entirely destroyed by the floods on the @entity122 last winter ( pictured ) huge swathes of the area were left underwater with residents forced to remain in their own homes for weeks he was brought before the courts in a private prosecution by the @entity130			1
he pleaded guilty to the offence in august			0
sentencing him , district judge @entity132 said his actions were selfish			1
the judge added : ‘ this sluice gate you opened was part of a historic system for controlling the flow of water			1
‘ it is clear to me you would have known last year was the wettest for many , many years			0
’ at the height of the floods , hundreds of people across @entity19 were forced to flee their houses			0
more than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were inundated and villages were cut off			0
@entity0 said he had lived in his current property for 28 years and opening the gates had never been a problem before			1
he said : ‘ if they [ the sluice gates ] were open for two hours , we would n’t flood			1
it goes into the field , then into the canal and into the river			0
the rivers are not being maintained			0
’ villages became entirely cut off for weeks with emergency supplies transported to residents in boats an abandoned car sits in a field with caravans and containers floating in the village of @entity171			0

his actions allowed *45,000,000* litres of water to flood @entity122
he was fined £ 1,000 by a judge who *condemned* his ' selfish local *concern* '
