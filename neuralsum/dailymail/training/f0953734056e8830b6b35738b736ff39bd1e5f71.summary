@entity2 ' eating habits have improved - except among the poor , a 12 - year study has found			1
the @entity4 found evidence of a widening wealth gap when it comes to diet			2
yet even among wealthier adults , food choices remain far from ideal			0
on an index of healthy eating where a perfect score is 110 , @entity2 adults averaged just 40 points in 1999 - 2000 , climbing steadily to 47 points in 2009 - 10 , the study found			1
a variety of healthy fruits and vegetables are displayed for sale at a market in @entity23 , which adults need to consume for a healthy diet scores for low - income adults were lower than the average and barely budged during the years studied			1
they averaged almost four points lower than those for high - income adults at the beginning ; the difference increased to more than six points in 2009 - 10			1
higher scores mean greater intake of heart - healthy foods including vegetables , fruits , whole grains and healthy fats , and a high score means a low risk of obesity and chronic illnesses including heart disease , strokes and diabetes			2
low scores mean people face greater chances for developing those ailments			0
the widening rich - poor diet gap is disconcerting and ' will have important public health implications , ' said study co-author dr. @entity56 of the @entity4			1
diet - linked chronic diseases such as diabetes have become more common in @entity2 in general , and especially in the poor , he noted			1
' declining diet quality over time may actually widen the gap between the poor and the rich , ' @entity56 said			1
@entity4 researchers developed the healthy diet index used for the study			2
it is similar to federal dietary guidelines but features additional categories including red and processed meats , sugar - sweetened beverages and alcohol			1
the study authors used that index along with government estimates on trans fat intake to evaluate information in 1999 - 2010 national health surveys that included interviews with people about their eating habits			2
the results are published monday in @entity82			0
@entity56 said the widening diet gap reflects an income gap that deepened during the recent financial crisis , which likely made healthy food less affordable for many people			1
@entity56 also noted that inexpensive highly processed foods are often widely available in low - income neighborhoods			2
the overall diet improvement was largely due to decreased intake of foods containing trans fats but the disappointing results point to a need for policy changes including better nutrition education , @entity56 said			0
in recent years the government and manufacturers have moved to phase out use of artificial trans fats in foods including processed cookies , cakes , frozen pizza and margarines			0
trans fats contribute to unhealthy cholesterol levels and can increase heart disease risks			0
these fats are made by adding hydrogen to vegetable oil to improve texture and shelf life			0
the study authors say their results are consistent with an earlier report showing that ' nearly the entire @entity2 population fell short of meeting federal dietary recommendations			1
' the federal guidelines are updated every five years and new ones will be issued next year			2
the current recommendations emphasize limiting intake of trans fats , sodium , processed foods and added sugars			0
they do n't specify amounts but encourage diets high in whole grains , vegetables and fruits			1
the @entity4 index has a similar emphasis with some specifics ; to get a top score would include eating daily more than two cups of vegetables , at least four servings of fruit and at least one ounce of nuts			0
a @entity82 editorial says the @entity4 diet index is n't perfect because it puts equal emphasis on various foods that may not contribute equally to health			0
still , the study highlights a ' growing chasm ' that is a public health concern , the editorial says			0
it suggests that government efforts to close the gap with programs including food stamps may be insufficient and that limiting government benefits to cover only healthful foods might be a better strategy .			0

a 12 - year study has *monitored* the diets of high income and low income adults in the @entity2
the widening diet gap between rich and poor is thought to have been *influenced* by the recent financial crisis
the study still showed ' nearly the entire @entity2 population fell short of meeting federal dietary recommendations '
