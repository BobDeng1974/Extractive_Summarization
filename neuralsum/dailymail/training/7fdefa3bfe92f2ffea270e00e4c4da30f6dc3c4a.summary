‘ we have n’t received a proper explanation for why it is even necessary			0
if a vehicle is suitable , why change it ? ” another ice cream seller , who did not want to named , said : ‘ there is a riot going off between ice cream companies and the council			1
‘ the council must have brain freeze to keep coming up with more stupid rules and regulations			0
out about in @entity35 : actress @entity58 and her new boyfriend @entity59 enjoyed a trip to an ice cream van in @entity35 last week as the weather heated up ‘ around 90 per cent of the ice cream vans on the road in @entity35 are over five - years - old and it costs thousands of pounds to replace each one			1

’ ' cold war ' : deputy prime minister @entity70 said while he supports emission - reducing schemes it needs to be done in a ' sensible way that does n't wipe out small firms ' the five - year - ban is the latest in a list of restrictions to the much - loved ice cream vans			1

@entity102 , @entity100 branch chairman , said : ‘ this ban is the most absurd and irrational decision to emanate from the @entity105 for some time			0
‘ it discriminates massively against one particular sector of free enterprise , setting the bar much higher for ice cream sellers than for people in any other trade or profession			2
‘ their day - to - day use on local rounds and the fact they only work eight months of the year means their mileage is generally minimal with little engine wear			2
‘ it is not unusual for a van to last 20 or more years and still remain serviceable			0
’ @entity124 , 60 , who set up his business 40 years and has six vehicles said : ‘ i have been to renew the annual licences for the vehicles that cost £ 235 per vehicle			2

it is part of the commitment to reduce emissions city - wide			2
