more than 100,000 @entity0 have applied for the right to work in @entity3 since the autumn of 2013			1
the count of @entity0 who asked for @entity8 numbers – necessary for anyone who wants to work legally in @entity3 – has risen nearly fivefold in a year			1
the explosion in numbers of @entity0 came alongside a sharp rise in applications from @entity14 for @entity8 documents			2
queue : @entity0 living in @entity18 line up to cast their vote in elections in their home country earlier this month there were 31,500 @entity14 who applied for and received their numbers in the year up to september – more than double the total in the previous 12 months			1
yesterday ’s official figures point to a large - scale movement into @entity3 of citizens of the two @entity29 countries which joined the @entity30 in 2007 and whose citizens were given the right to work freely in @entity3 from january			1
they tally with predictions from the @entity35 think tank which projected that the economic draw of jobs and benefits in @entity3 would bring in 50,000 people a year from two of the poorest countries in the @entity30			2
they suggest that some analysts , including those from the @entity47 , who declared earlier this year that there had been no new influx from the two countries , were badly off target			1
national insurance applications , counted by the @entity54 , show the number of people who applied for the documents they need to work rather than numbers newly arriving in the country			0
presence in @entity3 : @entity0 gather outside their embassy in @entity63 two weeks ago to protest that they were unable to vote in the election they appear to include a large number of people who were already in @entity3 before @entity0 and @entity14 were given the right to work in january			2
@entity68 , of the @entity69 , said that half of those applying for @entity8 numbers were ‘ people who had been in the @entity3 for a year or longer ’			1
the @entity69 analysis raises the possibility that many of the @entity0 and @entity14 may have been working illegally in @entity3 in the black economy			2
@entity69 immigration figures said immigrants in the year to june 2012 included 32,000 people from @entity0 and @entity14			0
of these arrivals , 24,000 are estimated to have come to @entity3 to work			0
the 103,900 national insurance numbers issued to @entity0 citizens in the year to september represented a 468 per cent rise on the 18,300 applications recorded in the previous 12 months			0
the 31,500 national insurance numbers issued to @entity14 was a rise of 205 per cent on the 10,300 in the previous 12 months			0
in the run - up to the @entity29 elections in may , the @entity47 claimed that there were 4,000 fewer @entity0 and @entity14 workers in @entity3 in march than in january			1
its political editor scoffed : ‘ so much for those predictions of a flood of immigrants coming from @entity0 and @entity14 once the door to the @entity3 was opened			0
’ however the @entity47 and other analysts who came to the same conclusion were using figures from the @entity101 , an @entity69 research survey that has too small a sample to provide an accurate count of small groups within the population			0
national insurance number applications , on the other hand , provide a fully accurate count of actual people who want to work legally in this country .			0

31,500 @entity14 applied for and received @entity8 numbers in year to sep
big movement into @entity3 of citizens of countries which joined @entity30 in 2007
their citizens were given the right to work freely in @entity3 from january
figures suggest some analysts - including from @entity47 - were off target
