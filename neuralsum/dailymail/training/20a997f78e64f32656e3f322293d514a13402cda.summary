by @entity0 , deputy political editor published : 06:21 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 17:16 est , 30 may 2013 who knows what @entity2 and @entity3 were chatting about as they relaxed on their recent break in @entity7 ? but , if former @entity10 spin doctor @entity9 is to be believed , they should have been discussing the key role she could play in helping her husband win the next election			1
mr @entity9 claims @entity3 is ‘ badly needed in the trenches ’ to save mr @entity17 ’s premiership			1
holiday : @entity3 and @entity17 are on a half - term break in @entity7 this week but former adviser @entity9 urged mrs @entity3 to join the battle now for @entity22 victory in 2015 in a damning critique of @entity22 prospects , he said the prime minister ’s wife should make more public appearances to boost his ‘ slim ’ chances of winning a majority in 2015			1
and he called on her to join ‘ small select strategy meetings ’ because she is one of the few people around mr @entity17 who gives him good advice			2
the prime minister may not want to hear from his former communications director who resigned in january 2011 and is now facing trial over allegations related to phone - hacking			1
but mr @entity9 used an article for @entity40 to deliver a withering assessment of @entity43 ’s performance			1
he said mrs @entity3 is needed now to boost the @entity45 ’s appeal to women and prove to voters that the couple are committed to staying in @entity10			2
he writes : ‘ the time has now come for @entity50 to play a more public role and take some risks			0
‘ she only joined the 2010 campaign once it formally kicked off			0
she should now be persuaded that the 2015 campaign is already underway and she ’s badly needed in the trenches			0
causes : since moving into @entity10 mrs @entity3 's media appearances have often been linked to charity work , including this visit with @entity61 to a refugee settlement in @entity63 , close to the @entity65 border in march fun : the pm 's wife donned a bright red wig in the run - up to @entity72 's @entity71 as she baked cakes in her @entity43 kitchen forces : she has also been heavily involved in promoting the tickets for troops project to secure entry to major events for military personnel ‘ @entity50 might also take a more active part behind the scenes			1
she is one of the few people able to see straight to the heart of a matter and offer a clear , sensible view			0
there are few people in no 10 with a better eye and she could play a key role in the winning back of female voters			2
’ mr @entity9 says the @entity22 have a ‘ real chance ’ of being the largest party after the next election but predicts a hung parliament rather than a @entity22 majority , with the @entity100 ‘ likely to hold on to the balance of power ’			1
he repeats rumours swirling in @entity103 that @entity10 is considering ditching live election tv debates in the run - up to the poll			0
but he says @entity43 should make clear now that the debates ‘ are very much on ’ and should press for a town hall - style debate with questions from the public rather than journalists			0
mr @entity9 is damning in his criticism of the way mr @entity17 has run his government over the past two years			1
echoing the concerns of many @entity117 that the @entity45 ’s inner circle is out of touch , mr @entity9 warned that the public are ‘ dangerously disconnected ’ from politicians			2
‘ @entity103 has never been more detached from the real world and ... he and his office must take responsibility and use the next two years to stop the rot , ’ mr @entity9 writes			2
he says the prime minister delivers ‘ turbo charged oratory ’ but ‘ only when his back is against the wall ’			0
mr @entity9 criticises mr @entity17 for failing to keep his mps on - side and advises : ‘ @entity2 should be better at recognising and supporting the talent he has throughout the party including the lower ranks			1
’ he also calls for the return of the ‘ currently under - employed ’ @entity138 , who resigned as defence secretary two years ago			0
popular : in the @entity142 first lady @entity141 has remained much more popular than husband @entity143 , something mrs @entity3 could replicate here tips : @entity9 urged his old boss @entity17 to listen to his wife 's advice more and rely less on civil servants the former spin doctor is critical of mr @entity17 ’s reliance on senior civil servants , dismissing cabinet secretary sir @entity153 as ‘ sir @entity154 ’			1
and in an implied criticism of his successors , mr @entity9 says @entity22 high command need to be better at getting their message across			1
he concludes that the @entity117 should ‘ identify a handful of issues that really matter to people and actually do something about them ’			0
a no 10 source said there were ‘ currently no plans ’ to increase mrs @entity3 ’s public appearances			2
mr @entity17 has already hired strategist @entity168 , who masterminded @entity171 ’s two @entity170 mayoral election victories , to help run the campaign in 2015			0
senior @entity117 have since suggested that the party turn to the @entity170 mayor to help woo voters , and say mr @entity171 has agreed to play a leading role as a ‘ frontman ’ in the campaign			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
