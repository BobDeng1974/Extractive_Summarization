detectives investigating claims of a @entity3 paedophile sex ring have been passed lurid allegations relating to @entity5			1
the late @entity7 mp , who was one of the most prominent and divisive politicians of the 20th century , was named in a @entity10 review into historic sex abuse			1
the claims relate to allegations of satanic rituals , often involving the abuse of children			1
the @entity24 has also handed detectives the name of @entity27 , the flamboyant @entity28 mp who died in 2008 aged 91			1
last night the @entity10 confirmed that both names had been passed on to detectives from @entity31 , a @entity33 inquiry into an alleged @entity35 paedophile network			1
the @entity37 was given the politicians ’ names by @entity39 , former @entity24 , who heard the allegations when he was a vicar counselling in the 1980s			1
mr @entity39 told senior clerics that @entity27 was named by three abuse survivors whom he counselled when he was a vicar in @entity44 in the 1980s			1
he also passed on the names of two former conservative cabinet ministers , who have not yet been publicly linked to the scandal			0
mr @entity39 was questioned by the @entity37 after the discovery of a book from 1991 in which he described counselling sessions with adult survivors			0
@entity5 is one of several high - profile names passed to @entity22 by @entity24 @entity23 , above , who is leading the review ‘ a number of survivors independently gave the name of a particular mp being involved , ’ he said , adding			1
‘ i do n’t believe there was any collusion in their stories			0
’ a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ the name @entity5 was passed to @entity31 on the instruction of bishop @entity23			1
’ in 1994 , an investigation by the @entity66 into 84 alleged cases of ‘ satanic abuse ’ in the @entity69 between 1987 and 1992 found no convincing corroborative evidence			1
the claims against @entity5 and @entity72 have emerged amid mounting claims of a paedophile network involving establishment figures , which was allegedly covered up by @entity76			1
police are to be given access to secret files held on mps in the @entity82 archives to help their search for evidence on suspected abusers , including former @entity27 mp @entity86			0
@entity5 ’s frontline political career ended in 1968 after he made his ‘ rivers of blood ’ speech warning about the dangers of uncontrolled immigration			1
@entity7 leader @entity93 sacked him from the shadow cabinet the following day , although @entity5 remained a @entity7 mp until 1974			1
@entity95 : monstrous slur against my friend four years before he died in 1998 , @entity5 did me the honour of asking me to write his biography			2
i spoke to almost everyone alive who knew him			0
when he died , i had unique access to a vast collection of private papers , including numerous intimate letters			0
if there is anyone alive other than @entity5 ’s widow and daughters who knows more about him than i do , i ’d like to meet him			2
i never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about @entity5 , writes @entity95 i never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about @entity5			2
his probity in personal and financial matters was rock solid			0
when on saturday evening a fellow journalist told me of the allegations made by the @entity10 , my first instinct was to laugh : but that soon changed into utter outrage when i realised he was serious			1
the @entity10 has publicly accused @entity5 of being involved in ritual satanic abuse on hearsay , without the slightest evidence			1
they might as well accuse him of having been a war criminal or an armed robber , for there would be as much truth in either allegation			0
the appalling slurs are just like those made against 91 - year - old @entity130 , a @entity131 veteran and former chief of defence staff , whose homes in @entity134 and @entity135 were gratuitously raided by police recently on the back of an unspecified allegation of a sexual nature dating back to the 1970s			0
it is not just that the bishops who have made these accusations are behaving in a remarkably un-christian fashion by putting this smear into the public domain			0
but that they do not appear even to have engaged what passes for their brains , or consciences , before behaving in this grotesque and offensive fashion			0
their brains should have told them that a man of @entity5 ’s controversial reputation would never for a moment have got away with the type of behaviour they are alleging he indulged in during the 1980s			2
the @entity159 turned against @entity5 in 1968 after the so - called @entity160 ; it would never have protected him for a second had it detected the slightest whiff of scandal			2
their consciences should have told them that to make such an outrageous allegation about an enormously distinguished public figure who can not defend himself , and which would cause the deepest distress to his family and friends , was the height of mischief and irresponsibility			0
it is disgraceful and destabilising for clergy to behave in this way , and the @entity10 needs to investigate those responsible for this smear and take action accordingly			2
these @entity182 accusations bring to mind the hysteria surrounding allegations of satanic abuse in the late 1980s and early 1990s , including notorious cases in @entity187 and the @entity188 that involved social workers and police forcibly removing children from their homes in dawn raids			1
when the @entity66 investigated 84 alleged cases , it found no convincing corroborative evidence of any abuse – yet families had been torn apart on the say - so of those who insisted action be taken			0
@entity5 , pictured making a speech in 1977 , has been named in a @entity10 review into historic sex abuse for decades , @entity5 has long been a bug - bear of the liberal establishment			1
he has been demonised not least because to attack his memory is a quick and effective way for them to score points by setting out their own political correctness			0
what better way for some mischievous @entity213 priest to damage @entity5 further than by linking him with the current rash of stories about child abuse ? in 1998 , just after @entity5 died , the @entity217 broadcast a programme in which they railed at @entity219 for his hypocrisy			1
they said this scourge of mass immigration had visited the @entity223 in 1953 to recruit black labour for the @entity225			0
i was told of the story before the programme was broadcast and informed its researcher that @entity5 had never been to the @entity223 in his life			2
i was told , effectively , that i was lying , and it was broadcast			0
a black clergywoman , then resident in @entity134 , talked at length of @entity5 having recruited her as a nurse			2
detailed investigation by the @entity217 complaints department found that the woman had been recruited after a visit to her island by @entity242 , not @entity5 at all , and the @entity243 was forced to make a grovelling on - air apology in peak time			2
i have long dreamt of the day when ignorant politicians and @entity159 figures would stop manipulating @entity5 ’s memory for their own advantage			1
but i never thought i would hear of bishops of the @entity10 doing it			0
the allegations are a monstrous lie			0
that the lie appears to have been retailed by a priest is beyond contempt			0
there must be an investigation and , for all the distress this outrage has caused , there must be a reckoning .			0
