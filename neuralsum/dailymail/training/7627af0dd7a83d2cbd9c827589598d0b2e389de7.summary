now one enterprising dental surgeon from @entity7 , @entity8 , has created a new tool he hopes will put a smile instead of a grimace on his patients ' faces			1
dr @entity14 has created a musical drill to drown out the ominous high - pitch whine of the tool			1
he hopes it will especially soothe his nervous younger patients			0
he said : ' the children are not afraid of doctor , many of them are afraid of drill			2
i modified this by putting a toy on the head of the drill and tell them that the toy will clean their teeth			0
' in 2006 , after a year of research , dr @entity14 created a musical dental drill			1
he modified a conventional dental drill , changing the buzzing sound to the music from a mp3 player			1
it also features colourful flashing lights			0
' the patient will hear the music louder when they open their mouths compared to when they close their mouths , ' said dr @entity14			1
the dental surgeon spent about six million rupiah ( Â£ 372 ) to modify the instrument			1
his patients can even request songs loaded onto the mp3 player			1
bringing fun into the dreaded dentist 's room ? the drill also features flashing lights and toys to distract children @entity14 also has various figurines made from silicon which can be placed on the drill head			2
he treats more than 15 patients a day , of whom about half are children			2
he says some adults also ask him to use the singing drill on them			0
one young patient , @entity79 , appeared to enjoy her dental treatment with the musical mouth implement at @entity14 's surgery			0
her mother , @entity83 , said : ' very interesting , the children listening to the music and they forget about the drill in their mouth			2
this is a good idea to overcome fear of dental drill			0
' dr @entity14 said with the musical drill , most of his children 's patients are not even aware of what he is doing			1
he presented his creation at the @entity98 in @entity99 in march this year .			0
