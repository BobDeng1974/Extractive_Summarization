just in time for @entity1 , @entity0 has put on a ghostly show near its north and south poles			1
@entity5 's moon produced a strange glow from massive emissions of two trace gases that moved along its dawn - dusk line			1
these regions are curiously shifted to the east or west , so that dawn is breaking over the southern region while dusk is falling over the northern one			0
high in the atmosphere of @entity0 , large patches of two trace gases glow near the north pole , on the dusk side of the moon , and near the south pole , on the dawn side			1
brighter colors indicate stronger signals from the two gases , @entity27 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) ; red hues indicate less pronounced signals researchers are baffled as to why these gases have moved off the poles – a phenomenon that conflicts with how scientists believe @entity0 's atmosphere behaves			1
the pair of patches was spotted by a @entity38 while investigating the chemical make - up of @entity0 's atmosphere			1
it has stumped scientists because they believed that concentrated pockets of gas such as this could not exist in the moon 's upper atmosphere due to its ferocious winds			0
' this is an unexpected and potentially ground - breaking discovery , ' said @entity49 , an astrochemist at @entity38			0
' these kinds of east - to - west variations have never been seen before in @entity0 's atmospheric gases			1
explaining their origin presents us with a fascinating new problem			0
' with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity0 resembles a frozen version of @entity60 several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere the mapping comes from observations made by the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , a network of high - precision antennas in @entity69			2
researchers were able to obtain spatial maps of chemicals in @entity0 's atmosphere from a ' snapshot ' observation that lasted less than three minutes			2
with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity0 resembles a frozen version of @entity60 several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			2
because @entity0 is smaller than @entity60 , its gravity does n’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 595 kilometres ) into space			2
as on @entity60 , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons , although the seasons on @entity0 are about seven @entity60 years long			2
@entity0 's ‘ water ’ is liquid methane , @entity91 , better known on @entity60 as natural gas			1
regular @entity60 - water , @entity95 , would be frozen solid on @entity0 where the surface temperature is @entity97 ( -292 ° f )			2
with @entity0 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as @entity60 's raindrops			1
as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes			0
but scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades			0
@entity0 's atmosphere has long been of interest because it acts as a chemical factory , using energy from the sun and @entity5 's magnetic field to produce a wide range of organic , or carbon - based , molecules			1
in this study , the researchers focused on two organic molecules , hydrogen isocyanide ( @entity27 ) and cyanoacetylene ( @entity28 ) that are formed in @entity0 's atmosphere			0
at lower altitudes , the @entity28 appears concentrated above @entity0 's north and south poles			1
but the highest altitudes , the gas pockets appeared to be shifted away from the poles			0
these off - pole locations are unexpected because the fast - moving winds in @entity0 's middle atmosphere move in an east – west direction , forming zones similar to @entity131 's bands , though much less pronounced			0
within each zone , the atmospheric gases should , for the most part , be thoroughly mixed - not distinct as is seen in these gases			0
the researchers do not have an explanation for their findings yet			0
' it seems incredible that chemical mechanisms could be operating on rapid enough timescales to cause enhanced ' pockets ' in the observed molecules , ' said @entity144 , a planetary scientist at @entity38			0
this true colourimage captured by @entity146 before a distant flyby of @entity5 's @entity0 shows a south polar vortex , or a swirling mass of gas around the pole in the atmosphere of the moon ' we would expect the molecules to be quickly mixed around the globe by @entity0 's winds			1
' at the moment , the scientists are considering a number of potential explanations , including thermal effects , previously unknown patterns of atmospheric circulation , or the influence of @entity5 's powerful magnetic field , which extends far enough to engulf @entity0			1
further observations are expected to improve the understanding of the atmosphere and ongoing processes on @entity0 and other objects throughout the solar system			0
studying this complex chemistry may provide insights into the properties of @entity60 's very early atmosphere , which may have shared chemical characteristics with present - day @entity0			1
the complex and dynamic atmosphere of @entity0 displays multiple haze layers near the north pole in this view			0

maps of @entity5 's @entity0 reveal shining patches of trace gases
they are near , but *slightly* shifted away , from north and south poles
this means dawn breaks over south while dusk falls over the north
@entity195 described as ' unexpected and potentially *groundbreaking* '
studying *behaviour* of @entity0 may provide clues to how @entity60 formed
