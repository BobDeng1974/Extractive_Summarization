by @entity0 published : 12:31 est , 20 october 2013 updated : 03:05 est , 21 october 2013 sir @entity1 , chief constable for @entity2 has provoked mixed reaction from colleagues for his pro-active approach to policing the most senior police officer in @entity2 has been warned against making arrests - because of fears that he is putting himself at unnecessary risk by enforcing the law			1
it comes after sir @entity1 flagged down a motorist on the @entity14 near @entity15 as he was travelling on a police motorcyle			1
he was later joined by traffic officers but this apparently was not enough to justify the risk to his personal safety			0
it is not the first time sir @entity1 has intervened to tackle motorists he suspects of drink - driving or speeding			1
last week @entity26 told @entity27 that the @entity28 ' regularly undertakes journeys in uniform ... on a marked police motorbike			0
' they added : ' the chief constable has on occasion had reason to deal with members of the public when issues such as driver behaviour have come to his attention			0
' although some of applauded sir @entity1 on his hands - on attitude to policing others have questioned whether his actions are appropriate given his level of seniority and in their statement @entity26 refused to give details of exactly what he had done			1
there is a worry that by carrying out policing without backup from his colleagies sir @entity1 could leave himself open to bogus complaints from a member of the public			2
although this is an issue faced daily by rank - and - file officers some believe that given his position it is a risk that the chief constable need not take			0
@entity65 , a former police officer who is now a @entity66 and member of the @entity69 ’s justice sub-committee on policing , told @entity27 that not only was he concerned about that vulnerablity of the chief constable but also that he ought to find better uses for his time			2
he said : ' i understand the concerns expressed by police officers about their chief constable acting in this way , particularly given he is head of the national service			0
' without a colleague on hand , sir @entity1 could find himself in difficulties not only in terms of a complaint but also in circumstances that escalate at the roadside as a result of his intervention			2
' i would always expect a police officer to intervene when a crime is being committed or life is at risk , but if the chief constable has the time to stop speeding motorists instead of calling in road patrol , i think on his salary he would be better occupied dealing with the many strategic issues facing his staff and the public			2
' sir @entity1 is well renowned within the police force for his enthusiasm for street policing			1
when he became chief constable of @entity106 police , which was previously @entity108 's largest police force , in 2007 he continued to regularly go out on patrol			2
newly appointed : chief constable sir @entity1 , pictured last year , earns £ 208,000 a year leading some critics to question whether pulling over speeding motorists is the best use of his time he is also thought to have joined his colleagues in a policing of a march by members of the far - right @entity119 in @entity120 last august			1
but despite concerns sir @entity1 , who earns £ 208,000 a year , has been congratualted on his actions be senior officers			1
@entity124 , president of the @entity125 , said : ' police officers can work in pairs for reasons of corroboration and health and safety , but you take the oath and you ’re expected to do the job			0
' our mission is to keep people safe and if you ’re on duty , in uniform , and see something that needs dealing with , it would be remiss not do so and could impact on public confidence			0
' i think it ’s laudable we have a chief constable who is highly visible			0
there are many police officers who carry out their duties alone			0
' and it appears sir @entity1 is not alone in his proactive stance - in june , @entity151 , the new chief constable of @entity153 police , was applauded for chasing suspected criminals through @entity156 town centre on his first day in the job .			1

sir @entity1 was alone when he flagged down a motorist on the @entity14 near @entity15 as he was travelling on a police motorcyle
he is @entity2 's most senior officer and known for his hands - on approach
some question whether it is the best use of the £ 208,000 - a - year boss 's time
