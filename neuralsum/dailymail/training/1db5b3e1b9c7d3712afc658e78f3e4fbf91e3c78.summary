artificial leaves have been shown to harness solar energy and turn it into hydrogen for use in fuel cells , for example			1
but cars and other vehicles still predominantly rely on liquid fuels			0
with this in mind , researchers have designed a bionic leaf that not only uses solar energy to produce oxygen and hydrogen , it feeds this hydrogen to bacteria that is then engineered to make isopropanol			1
researchers have designed a leaf that uses solar energy to produce oxygen and hydrogen			2
this hydrogen is fed to a bacterium called @entity25			0
an enzyme takes the hydrogen back to protons and electrons and combines them with carbon dioxide			1
this is then engineered to make isopropanol ( illustrated ) @entity34 is an alcohol molecule that can be used as fuel , similar to ethanol or gasoline , and can be separated from water using salt			0
the technology was created by a team from @entity44 's @entity43 , @entity45 and the @entity46 at @entity44			0
it builds on the work of professor of energy @entity49 and his ‘ artificial leaf ’ first demonstrated in 2011			1

it builds on the work of professor of energy @entity49 and his ‘ artificial leaf ’ first demonstrated in 2011			1
professor @entity49 ’s ‘ leaf ’ was made from a silicon strip coated with catalysts on each side			2
the @entity44 leaf produces oxygen and hydrogen in the same way as professor @entity49 ’s , but the hydrogen is then channeled through a chamber filled with a bacterium called @entity25			1
an enzyme in this bacteria takes the hydrogen back to protons and electrons , and these are combined with carbon dioxide within the same chamber			1
the researchers then extract this bacteria , with the protons , electrons and carbon dioxide and metabolically engineers it to make isopropanol			1
this engineering method was discovered by @entity81 , professor of microbiology and of health sciences and technology at @entity85			0
professor @entity49 ’s ‘ leaf ’ was made from a silicon strip coated with catalysts on each side			2
when placed in water and exposed to sunlight , the strip split the water molecules to release and oxygen and hydrogen			0
‘ this is a proof of concept that you can have a way of harvesting solar energy and storing it in the form of a liquid fuel , ’ said researcher @entity93			1
‘ [ professor @entity49 ’s ] formidable discovery of the catalyst really set this off , and we had a mission of wanting to interface some kinds of organisms with the harvesting of solar energy			2
‘ it was a perfect match			0

‘ the advantage of interfacing the inorganic catalyst with biology is you have an unprecedented platform for chemical synthesis that you do n't have with inorganic catalysts alone , ’ said @entity136 , a graduate student in systems biology and co-author of the paper			0
the @entity44 technology builds on the work of @entity49 and his ‘ artificial leaf ’ first ( pictured )			1
professor @entity49 ’s ‘ leaf ’ was made from a silicon strip coated with catalysts on each side			2
when placed in water and exposed to sunlight , the strip split the water molecules to release and oxygen and hydrogen the same principles could be used to produce drugs such as vitamins ( stock image shown ) ‘ solar - to - chemical production is the heart of this paper , and so far we 've been using plants for that , but we are using the unprecedented ability of biology to make lots of compounds			1
’ the same principles could be used to produce drugs such as vitamins in small amounts , @entity93 said			2
and in theory , any carbon - based liquid fuel could be engineered from the process			1
the team said its immediate challenge is to increase the bionic leaf 's ability to turn solar energy to biomass by optimising the catalyst and the bacteria			0
their goal is 5 per cent efficiency , compared to nature 's rate of 1 per cent efficiency for photosynthesis to turn sunlight into biomass			0
‘ we 're almost at a 1 per cent efficiency rate of converting sunlight into isopropanol , ’ professor @entity49 said			0
‘ there have been 2.6 billion years of evolution , and [ professor silver ] and i working together a year and a half have already achieved the efficiency of photosynthesis			0
’ the findings are published in the journal @entity208 and co-authors include @entity210 , and @entity211 .			0

the technology was created by biologists from @entity44
it builds on the work of @entity49 and his ‘ artificial silicon leaf ’
this leaf produces oxygen and hydrogen from solar energy
@entity44 leaf produces oxygen and hydrogen in the same way but the hydrogen is fed into a chamber containing bacterium @entity25
an enzyme in the bacterium takes hydrogen back to protons and electrons
these are combined with carbon dioxide engineered to make isopropanol
the same principles could be used to produce drugs such as vitamins
and in theory , any carbon - based liquid fuel could be engineered
