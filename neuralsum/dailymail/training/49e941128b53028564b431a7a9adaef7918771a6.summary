women going through the menopause may suffer hot flushes for as long as 14 years , warn researchers she said ‘ the duration of 7.4 years highlights the limitations of guidance recommending short - term hormone therapy and emphasises the need to identify safe long - term therapies for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms			1

the study of 1,449 women with frequent hot flushes or night sweats is the largest study of its kind and included four ethnic groups			0
the average length of time women endured symptoms was 7.4 years			1
half of the women were affected for less than that time , but half had symptoms longer — some for at least 14 years , researchers reported in @entity56 ( must credit )			1

researchers found half the women in a large study had uncomfortable , often distressing symptoms for more than seven years on average			1
for women who got hot flushes before they stopped menstruating , they were likely to continue for years after the menopause , longer than for women whose symptoms only began when their periods had stopped			1
in the study , one in eight women began getting hot flushes while still having regular periods			0
for two - thirds of women , they began in perimenopause , the period of time before the menopause sets in when periods become more scant			0
women who started getting hot flushes when they were still having regular periods or were in early perimenopause experienced symptoms for around 11.8 years			2
about nine of those years occurred after menopause , nearly three times the average of 3.4 years for women whose hot flushes did not start until their periods stopped			1

none had had a hysterectomy or both ovaries removed and none were on hormone therapy			0
the study comprised of women from different ethnic groups living in @entity9 , including @entity58 , @entity141 and @entity143 descent and @entity59 as well as white women and reasons for variation in the length of menopause between the groups were unclear , said the researchers			1
dr @entity151 , chief of preventive medicine at the @entity154 - affiliated @entity153 and an author of a commentary on the study , said ‘ women with more stress in their lives may be more aware of their symptoms and perceive them to be more bothersome			0
