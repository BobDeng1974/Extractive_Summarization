as @entity2 guided a shot past @entity5 goalkeeper @entity4 in the 77th minute on saturday evening , @entity1 fans could be forgiven for getting a little carried away			1
not only with their side 's impressive victory - a 3 - 0 win over the @entity9 leaders away from home - but with the continuing brilliance of their two - goal talisman			1
@entity2 's double in @entity16 and assist for @entity17 sent @entity19 's men top of their @entity21 qualifying group to give supporters hope of a first appearance at a major finals since 1958			2
@entity2 celebrates scoring his first goal of the game during @entity1 ' 3 - 0 victory against @entity5 on saturday but as well as strengthening @entity1 ' chances of a trip to @entity33 next summer , @entity2 's performance served to further enhance his reputation as a @entity37 legend in the making			1
after months of criticism in @entity41 , the @entity39 forward reminded everyone of his ability with a clever header to set up @entity17 , stunning free - kick to make it 2 - 0 and powerful finish to kill @entity5 off			1
still only 25 , @entity2 already has more goals ( 16 ) than @entity1 greats @entity49 ( 15 ) and @entity51 ( 12 )			1
and with a place at the @entity55 at stake , the former @entity53 man has the perfect opportunity to surpass both in the hearts of fans , too			0
@entity51 celebrates during his playing days with @entity1 team - mates having scored for his country @entity1 legend @entity49 , firing in a header , helped guide @entity1 to the 1958 @entity65 quarter - finals the @entity1 talisman gets ready to sign a shirt for a fan during a training session with children in @entity16 @entity49 38 caps ( 1950 â€“ 65 ) , 15 goals @entity65 quarter - finals 1958 clubs : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 major honours : @entity81 ( @entity75 ) 1958 , 1960 , 1961 and @entity82 1959 , 1960 @entity51 64 caps ( 1991 - 2007 ) , 12 goals club : @entity85 ( 1990 - 2014 ) major honours : 13 @entity88 titles , 4 @entity89 , 2 champions @entity90 , 3 @entity92 , 1 @entity93 , 1 @entity94 @entity2 49 caps ( 2006 - pres ) , 16 goals clubs : @entity98 , @entity53 , @entity39 major honours : @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity93 , @entity94 ( all 2014 ) it was @entity49 who led @entity1 to the @entity65 in @entity104 57 years ago , giving the country an all - too - rare chance to test themselves against the best teams on the planet			1
they reached the quarter - finals on that occasion , losing narrowly to eventual winners @entity112 as @entity113 grabbed the only goal of the game			1
@entity49 , who scored in a group stage draw with @entity117 , missed out on the last - eight clash after being injured against the same opponents in a play - off			2
@entity2 plays football with a group of children from @entity125 and @entity126 communities in a training session in @entity16 @entity2 fires homes with a brilliant free - kick as @entity1 won 3 - 0 in @entity5 in the @entity131 qualifier but such was his influence on the team that @entity1 manager @entity134 remarked : ' with @entity49 in the side we might have won '			1
it was a view backed up by @entity49 ' former international team - mate @entity138 in an interview last year			0
he told @entity140 : ' had he ( @entity49 ) been fit enough to play , i 'm not saying we would have won , but he was such a great player			0
' similarly , it would be hard to imagine where @entity1 might be without the injection of quality which @entity2 brings			0
former @entity85 favourites @entity51 ( right ) and @entity148 ( left ) vie for possession @entity2 ( centre ) leads the celebrations after his second - half free kick put @entity1 2 - 0 up against rivals @entity5 @entity49 won 38 caps for @entity1 from 1950 - 1965 , helping them win the @entity155 would they have beaten @entity5 without him in the team ? possibly , but there 's no chance it would have been as comfortable a victory as we witnessed on saturday night			1
@entity51 can also claim to be among @entity1 ' finest players , having pulled on the famous red shirt on 64 occasions during his distinguished club career with @entity85			2
but he could never quite replicate @entity49 and drag his country to a major tournament			2
@entity51 , in action for @entity1 versus @entity170 , never managed to qualify for a major tournament with his national side @entity39 forward @entity2 celebrates with the 2014 @entity100 trophy next to @entity174 @entity49 ( centre ) rises highest to out - jump @entity177 defenders during a @entity65 qualifier in @entity77 in 1953 @entity1 would have made it to the 1994 @entity65 had they beaten @entity180 in their final qualifier in november , 1993 , but they lost 2 - 1 at @entity182			1
and a decade later they missed out on a place at @entity184 after losing 1 - 0 to @entity185 in a two - legged play - off			0
speaking after watching his side go top of their group on saturday , @entity1 boss @entity19 said : ' we nearly did it in 1994 and 2004 and now we have the opportunity to go a step further			0
' people say it 's a golden generation but we need to earn it			0
we 're doing it but we 've not done it yet			0
' we want the chance to prove since 1958 this team is as good as anything that 's gone before			0
' fire wales to @entity21 and @entity2 may well be regarded as the greatest @entity205 player of all time			0
@entity51 , who picked up 64 international caps , salutes the @entity1 fans having scored for his country			2

@entity2 scored twice during 3 - 0 victory for @entity1 against @entity5
@entity51 was capped 64 times by @entity1 between 1991 - 2007
@entity1 last qualified for a major tournament at the 1958 @entity65
