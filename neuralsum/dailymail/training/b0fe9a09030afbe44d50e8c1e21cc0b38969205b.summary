by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:38 pm on 18th june 2011 the autopsy done on little @entity5 's body was ' shoddy , ' a renowned forensic expert said in court today			1
dr @entity7 , who spoke for the defence in @entity5 's murder trial , also said the duct tape @entity12 prosecutors say suffocated the child was not applied until after her body had decomposed			1
dr @entity7 , who has contributed expert opinion in several high - profile cases including @entity18 and record executive @entity19 , spoke on the third day of the defence 's case			1
tearful : an emotional @entity5 stares into the distance as an expert forensic doctor calls her daughter 's original autopsy ' shoddy ' he also testified it was a failure that the two - year - old 's skull was not opened during the official autopsy			1
dr @entity7 himself conducted a second autopsy later			0
' the head is part of the body and when you do an examination you examine the whole body , ' he said			0
' that to me is a signal of a shoddy autopsy			0
' defence : forensic expert dr @entity7 holds up a plastic skull as he tells the court how little @entity5 's skull should have been opened in the first autopsy @entity5 , 25 , has pleaded not guilty to killing her daughter in the summer of 2008			1
if convicted she faces a possible death sentence			2
the defence maintains the little girl drowned in her grandparents ' swimming pool			2
dr @entity7 said he had intended to attend @entity5 's original autopsy after her remains were found in a wooded area in december 2008			1
he eventually came to @entity59 to conduct his own exam and visited the crime scene , reviewed photos and read the official autopsy reports			0
revelations : dr @entity7 , seen here against a blurred out picture of @entity5 's skull , told the court the duct tape @entity12 prosecutors say suffocated the child was not applied until after her body had decomposed there were ' specks ' of decomposition sediment inside the left side of @entity5 's skull , which @entity7 said indicated the girl 's death was not necessarily a homicide			1
@entity80 and @entity82 medical examiner @entity81 determined that @entity5 was killed ' by undetermined means			1
' if the tape had suffocated @entity5 , evidence of skin would have been on the sticky side of the tape , he said			1
but there was no such evidence on the tape			0
' i had problems with ( the manner of death finding ) , ' dr @entity7 said			2
' when a body decomposes the tape comes loose on the skeletal structure			0
ca n't look : @entity100 turns her head away as dr @entity7 's showed photos of her daughter 's skull to the court parents : @entity5 's grandmother , @entity5 , looks away from the courtroom monitor as the two - year - old 's skull is shown , left , while her husband @entity113 , right , stares straight ahead in this case , the only thing that held the tape there was hair and roots			1
' my strong opinion is duct tape was placed there to hold the ( decomposed ) lower jaw in place			2
' prosecutor @entity126 attacked dr @entity7 's assessments on cross examination , arguing that he did n't have nearly as much information as dr @entity81 did when she made her evaluation			2
mr @entity126 also challenged dr @entity7 to cite a particular written protocol that said the skull must be opened in every autopsy			2
' i 'm not aware of where you can find a protocol , but i can assure you it is part of a complete autopsy , ' dr @entity7 said			0
an oversight ? @entity100 , right , consoles her attorney @entity140 , left , after judge @entity142 finds the defence 's first witness testimony was not disclosed to the prosecution earlier later , he suggested the position of hair found with the child 's skull might have been staged when it was photographed in the medical examiner 's office			1
' it would n't be the first time , sir , " he said			0
' it 's my opinion that somebody did			2
' the testimony of the defence 's first witness of the day , forensic anthropologist @entity156 , was interrupted after prosecutors said he testified about information not previously disclosed to the state			1
the objection came after mr @entity156 said it would be impossible to determine the exact position of duct tape on a corpse			0
you did what ? judge @entity142 dismissed the defence 's first witness and has retained the right to hold mr @entity140 in contempt of court after the trial ends because tape loses its stickiness , it may be shifted , and animals could have come in contact with the body , he said			1
with the jury sent out of the courtroom , judge @entity142 questioned mr @entity156 about his planned testimony			2
mr @entity156 told him that he initially told lead defence attorney @entity140 the information in february			1
mr @entity140 told @entity142 the non-disclosure was not intentional			0
he said prosecutors had declined an opportunity to further question mr @entity156 before trial and only asked for the pre-testimony report all witnesses were to submit			0
victim : @entity100 , 25 , has pleaded not guilty to killing two - year - old @entity5 in the summer of 2008 judge @entity142 said mr @entity140 's conduct seemed to have violated a pre-trial order he issued			1
' what you are basically saying is you can pick which orders you will comply and not comply with , ' the judge told mr @entity140			0
' it appears to me this was quite intentional			0
it was not an inadvertent slip			0
' judge @entity142 decided to have mr @entity156 step down from the witness stand today , allowing the state an opportunity to question him outside court			2
he said he would consider a special instruction to jurors about the non-disclosure and would reserve the right to hold mr @entity140 in contempt of court after the trial ends			1
judge @entity142 also warned mr @entity140 about further infractions that could end in witness exclusion			0
' @entity216 does not strike twice in one place , ' judge @entity142 said			0
' i 'm not making any promises of warranties if this happens a second time with this witness			0
