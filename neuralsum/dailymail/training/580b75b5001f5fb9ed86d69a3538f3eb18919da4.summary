to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the last execution in @entity2 today a newly - elected @entity4 mep has called for its reintroduction			1
@entity6 , who represents @entity7 in the @entity8 , said there was no ‘ ethical reason ’ to keep child killers and police murderers alive			1
the remarks , which come as anti-death penalty activists welcomed today ’s milestone , are likely to spark controversy			0
@entity24 and @entity25 were hanged simultaneously in @entity26 and @entity27 for the murder of @entity29 - a 53 year - old van driver , who died in a bloody heap at his home after being bludgeoned with an iron bar			0
their crime was quickly exposed after a neighbour was woken up by a suspicious noise in mr @entity29 's house and looked out to see a car disappearing down the street			0
@entity25 made the fatal mistake of leaving his raincoat at the scene			0
it only took a matter of days for police to track down and arrest the killers			0
they were found guilty in june , had their appeals rejected on july 21 and were hanged three weeks later			0
it comes as a poll shows falling support for capital punishment – although the public are still narrowly in favour of its reintroduction			1
ms @entity6 , @entity4 ’s health spokesman , claimed today that the public were ‘ fed up ’ with the criminal justice system			1
she said : ‘ the death penalty wo n’t bring back a tortured and murdered child , but it seems natural justice that the family will know the killer has paid the ultimate price and is n’t still breathing when their child is not			2
‘ an innocent child has more of a right to life than the monster that took their life , so i see no ethical reason why we are obliged to keep him alive			1
‘ why should double cop - killer @entity78 be kept alive , after shooting them more than 8 times and using a hand - grenade			1
his crime was n’t impulsive or emotional , he lured them in with a fake 999 call and he ’d killed two other people prior to that			0
’ she added : ‘ @entity88 , the father of murdered @entity89 agrees that the death penalty should be brought back , and as his life has been devastated by a cold - blooded killer , i think his views should be listened to			2
‘ the killers of @entity95 despise the @entity2 and want to kill us all , yet we have to use tax - payers money to keep them alive and well in prison , and look after their ‘ human - rights ’			1
despite strong support for the death penalty among @entity4 supporters it is not the party ’s official policy			0
but ms @entity6 said : ‘ the country has not had a debate on this issue for 10 years			2
‘ @entity4 believe in direct democracy , which means referendums on major issues , where the public demand one			2
‘ if there were a referendum , i would support a return of the death penalty for certain types of crimes			2
’ a @entity120 poll released to coincide with the anniversary of the last death penalty in @entity2 has revealed that 45 per cent of the public are in favour of capital punishment – with 39 per cent against			1

@entity4 's ms @entity6 said the notorious killers of drummer @entity136 - @entity135 ( left ) and @entity137 ( right ) - should be sentenced to death the strongest support for reintroduction was among @entity4 voters , the over- 60s and the poor			1
the country was split – 42 per cent to 42 per cent - over whether it was a good or bad thing that @entity2 had abolished the death penalty			2
more than half – 57 per cent - of 18 - to 24 - year - olds thought abolition was a good thing			0
