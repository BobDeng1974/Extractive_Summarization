rating : many years ago , @entity0 sold his @entity2 group to @entity3 , of which @entity5 hotel , near @entity6 , was a part			1
then , two years ago , @entity3 went bust and @entity0 headed a team of investors to buy the hotel back from @entity3 's receivers			1
the team went on to double the number of rooms and added a new spa ( including indoor pool ) and dining room			1
going back in time : @entity5 is delightfully old - fashioned - and mostly in a good way we opt for a room in the main house , reached via a narrow , airless , fusty corridor that becomes more and more dreary the longer it goes on			1
there are windows half - way along this passage , hidden behind net curtains			1
but no light seems to come through			2
we take a peep - and discover that the windows are all bricked up			2
our room is spacious with two large sash windows and a proper antique chest of drawers			2
best bit is the huge , comfy bed with no shortage of pillows			2
this is old - fashioned country house hotel territory			1
the bathroom is up a few stairs ( handrail provided ) and it 's some time since we 've come across a shower curtain			0
downstairs is more contemporary , more airy			0
the new dining room feels like a conservatory , with lots of space and floor to ceiling doors leading into the garden			0
the garden is a big deal here , especially the area given over to herbs — more than 400 varieties , including 50 types of mint			2
we 're on a dinner , bed and breakfast rate of £ 199 for two people			0
staff are attentive and , astonishingly , all seem to be @entity72			0
we get the impression locals enjoy working at @entity5			1
while we peruse the menu , a waitress leaves an @entity76 on the table , which , she explains , is the wine list			1
i pick it up and start flicking through the electronic pages , but find the whole process unbearable			0
' i 'm so sorry , but i spend almost every moment of every day staring at a screen and would love not to do so on a friday evening			0
do you have a printed version ? ' i ask			0
' we do n't i 'm afraid , ' she says			0
no @entity76 or tablets are deployed at breakfast			1
instead , there are lots of newspapers , a buffet and a proper a la carte menu			0
my wife thinks electronic menus will be perfectly normal in a few years			0
i hope she 's wrong			0
they certainly do n't belong at @entity5			1
