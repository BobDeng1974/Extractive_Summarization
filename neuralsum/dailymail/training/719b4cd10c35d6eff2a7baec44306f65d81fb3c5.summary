by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 1:16 am on 27th january 2012 hundreds of railway staff will be paid £ 2,500 ‘ bribes ’ simply for agreeing to work without disruption during the @entity5			1
it also emerged yesterday that the total bill for the @entity8 could hit £ 24billion – ten times the original estimate			2
the rail deal means staff will earn £ 900 bonuses just for turning up for work			1
the 500 @entity15 workers will also be guaranteed five hours of overtime a week , for which they will be paid 75 per cent above their normal shift rate			1
driver-less ... but staff on the @entity15 network - which will carry spectators to and from the @entity5 - have been offered a 25 per cent increase in overtime this means some staff could end up with an extra £ 2,500 by the end of the @entity5 and @entity28			1
it is the latest in a series of lucrative agreements struck by @entity34 ’s @entity33 union which have been described as ‘ ransom payments ’ to prevent chaos on public transport during the @entity8			1
and it will antagonise taxpayers who learned yesterday that the cost of the @entity5 has soared			0
when @entity42 won the bid to host the @entity8 , in 2005 , ministers said it would cost £ 2.37billion			0
the @entity44 has since budgeted £ 9.3billion to cover venues , policing and security			0
' bragging ' : @entity34 , the @entity33 's general secretary but hundreds of ‘ hidden ’ costs mean the true bill could be between £ 2.4billion and £ 14billion more than this , according to a @entity52 investigation			1
these costs include land purchases , anti-terrorism funding and transport improvements			0
bonuses to stop @entity57 staff striking , converting venues for public use after the @entity8 , employing anti-doping officers and investing in tourism also add to the cost			1
the @entity64 ’ @entity63 called on the government to stop ‘ merrily writing cheques ’ and remember the millions of ordinary families ‘ paying for this event ’			0
last night , @entity69 , @entity70 mp for @entity71 , said : ‘ this is grotesque			0
many people will have to work overtime during the @entity5 but they do not get huge payments			2
‘ just because the word “ @entity5 ” has been mentioned does not been they should be handed more money			0
’ and @entity78 , @entity70 mp for @entity79 and @entity80 , said : ‘ yet again @entity34 ’s brinkmanship means taxpayers coughing up to pay rail staff bonuses just for doing their job			1
let the @entity8 commence : the deal would cover a period of almost nine weeks during the @entity5 and @entity28 ‘ this deal shows how out of touch the militant unions are with the reality of the straitened times everyone else faces			2
’ but mr @entity34 , the @entity33 ’s general secretary , said : ‘ this is a truly groundbreaking deal , raising the bar in the industry and putting £ 2,500 in our members ’ pockets as a reward for the extra workload and pressure they will carry			1
’ @entity102 , which operates the @entity15 trains on behalf of @entity104 , said that the deal was ‘ fair ’ and reflected the extra hours that staff would be asked to work and ‘ restrictions to their annual leave ’ during that time			1
the @entity15 has no drivers , but on - board ‘ captains ’ responsible for passenger safety are paid an average of £ 36,000			1
they are usually paid 50 per cent extra on their normal shift rate for overtime , but this will rise to 75 per cent during the @entity8			1
last night it was unclear which public body would pay			2
@entity104 said it would bill the @entity119 for the overtime , but an @entity119 spokesman said it would only ‘ reimburse @entity104 for normal overtime payments ’ incurred during the @entity5 and not bonus payments			2
tube drivers will be paid up to £ 1,200 extra for working changed and longer duties during the @entity5			0
they are also in talks with @entity104 over a separate bonus			0
train drivers working for @entity130 are getting a £ 500 bonus			0
a spokesman for the @entity133 denied that the overall cost of the @entity8 would hit £ 24billion			0
‘ @entity136 is £ 9.3billion and includes all additional security , defence and public transport provision , ’ the spokesman said			0
‘ it is simply not right to start adding budgets that would have been in existence regardless of 2012 and claim that as being an @entity119 cost			2

workers on driver-less @entity15 network offered 25 per cent overtime increase during the 2012 games
@entity33 describes pay deal as ' truly groundbreaking '
*critics* accuse rail *bosses* of ' bribing ' staff ' not to strike '
