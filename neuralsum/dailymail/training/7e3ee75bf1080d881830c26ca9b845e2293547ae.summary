it was all going so well for @entity1			2
six games played and no goals conceded			0
the statistics laughed in the face of critics who said in the summer that once again they had failed to bring in the correct defensive reinforcements			0
then they played a team with something approaching a world class forward line and the house of cards came tumbling down			0
@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 is not the @entity17 's greatest forward line but it 's a good few notches up on the @entity20 league teams @entity1 have played so far and it was too much for a back four made - up of three full - backs ( two of them who play like wingers , and one converted into a centre - back ) and a holding midfielder , also converted into a centre back			1
those flying full - backs @entity28 and @entity30 were at fault for the first two goals			1
@entity28 conceded the free - kick for the first and @entity35 lost possession ahead of the second			1
the @entity38 gave the ball away 15 times and @entity35 8 times as @entity1 lost possession 82 times during the game			0
@entity45 heads in @entity47 's second goal of the evening during the @entity49 clash with @entity1 having not conceded in their opening six games of the season , @entity1 then shipped three in one game ' i have seen a lot of @entity1 games and teams always create chances by getting in behind their advanced full - backs , ' said @entity61 after the game			1
@entity1 always played with a high full - back under @entity64 but he was usually balanced out by a more defensive player on the opposite flank			2
@entity64 's @entity1 , at its best , had @entity28 on the right and @entity69 on the left			1
@entity71 has long been one risk too many , especially against good teams			0
in the centre of defence it would be unfair to blame the @entity78 axis – almost as unfair as when the @entity80 defender was confronted by an angry fan at the club 's training ground last week over a bet the supporter had lost because @entity1 failed to beat @entity86 ; @entity78 did n't even play in the game			1
in truth both have been solid and developed a good understanding			0
both have the pace to play the high line that suits @entity1 's pressing game but it 's also true that neither is the young dynamic defender the club 's supporters have long requested be signed			2
@entity1 play with an incredibly high defensive line which can leave them exposed on the flanks under @entity64 , @entity28 would attack while the left - back defended , but now both push forward there was an attempt in the summer to sign @entity106 but @entity1 were priced out of the move			1
late on in tuesday 's game he made the last gasp save from @entity30 that made sure of all three points			2
his wild celebration – as if he had scored – was telling			0
he had shown on the night that he was worth the money @entity1 were unable or unwilling to pay for him			0
alongside him was @entity115 who had also been on @entity1 's radar and in the stands was a watching @entity118 who was the original ' missed target ' as they have failed to sign a top defender despite the obvious need			1
@entity123 and @entity124 are on form for @entity1 but without an improved defence they will struggle this was arguably the first time this season that @entity1 had faced an attacking line - up with real quality one top defender who is at @entity1 is @entity133 but he has only started two games all season and is evidently not in @entity137 's first choice xi. on his own recent admission he is not the majestic all - conquering defender of old and is currently third choice			1
with @entity133 back to his best and either @entity78 or @entity141 at left back to give the back four more balance we may yet see @entity1 sort themselves out defensively			2
settling on a keeper and bringing to an end the constant switching between @entity148 and @entity149 may also help			0
until such time they will continue to be picked off by @entity17 's best attacking teams			0
they ca n't win the @entity49 if when @entity124 and @entity123 score at one end , chaos continues to reign at the other			1

@entity1 beaten 3 - 2 by @entity47 in @entity49
@entity137 's side had not conceded all season before @entity47 match
@entity123 and @entity124 scored for @entity166 club
@entity115 , @entity168 and @entity45 scored for @entity80 champions
@entity28 and @entity30 left @entity1 exposed down the flanks
