by @entity0 you are a businessman in @entity2 with a crucial dinner this evening in @entity4			1
even allowing for the nine - hour time difference , you wo n’t need to reset your morning alarm as you ’ll be on the ground and knocking back the sake just two hours after take - off			2
or maybe you ’re a busy working woman keen to get the @entity11 shopping done			0
you ca n’t waste too much time on it - so how about @entity15 ? you ’ll be there in less than an hour			0
boarding all rows for flight hypersonic ! @entity19 are developing the sr - 72 spy plane with an engine which could propel it up to 4,567mph , or six times the speed of sound			1
the same technology could be used in passenger jets long restricted to the realms of sci - fi , the dream of flying at least five times the speed of sound - and getting anywhere in the world in less time than it takes to go from @entity29 to @entity30 on the fast train - came a step nearer this month			1
engineers at @entity19 in the @entity39 revealed that they are developing the @entity40 , a successor to the @entity42 , the iconic @entity42 long - distance spy plane			1
the @entity42 holds the air speed record of @entity44 - three times the speed of sound - but the @entity40 will go twice that speed , at up to 4,567 mph			1
at @entity49 , it would be three times as fast as @entity51			1
able to circumnavigate the globe in six hours at an altitude of about 80,000ft , @entity54 , as it ’s been dubbed , will be an extraordinary weapon of war : effectively , it will be too fast to shoot down and too fast for moving military targets to avoid it			2
indeed , it will be so fast it will have to be clad in a skin made from titanium crystals wrapped in carbon fibre to resist the extreme friction heat such speeds will create			0
all very useful militarily , but the question many scientists and aviation experts have been asking is : can the same technology be used to transform civil aviation to send passengers around the world in lightning speed ? enthusiasts have been talking up hypersonic travel for years and , apart from a few short - lived experiments , nothing much has happened			2
this is largely because the field is fiendishly expensive to develop and the technical difficulties enormous			0
but what has excited aviation experts about @entity19 ’s announcement is that it claims to have overcome the biggest technical hurdle - the so - called ‘ thrust gap ’ in the plane ’s propulsion			1
essentially , while a conventional jet turbine can get a plane up to @entity90 , the so - called ‘ scramjet ’ - a powerful jet engine that can work at extraordinarily high speeds by sucking in supersonic air - can not start working until the plane is flying at more than @entity96			1
the problem is bridging the gap from the lower speed to the higher one			0
but @entity19 says it has designed an engine that can do just that , powering the aircraft from a standstill to @entity49			1
‘ it ’s a significant step forward			0
they seem to have simplified things , ’ says dr @entity105 , senior lecturer in aeronautical engineering at @entity107			0
a specialist in hypersonic flight , he believes such travel would be a ‘ great development for mankind ’ , but adds : ‘ it would shrink the world even more than we already have , but it ’s not going to happen overnight			0
‘ there ’s a lot of technology to be developed and we have to have governments and companies who are prepared to research and design it - and then airlines to buy it			2
’ but he believes that if the money were available - and we are talking serious money - a hypersonic passenger jet would not be unfeasible			1
it could even be developed by 2030			0
nobody denies the challenges of building a @entity49 passenger jet would be far greater than for a spy plane the size of a fighter jet			1
any passenger jet to use the engines would be able to reach @entity4 in two hours and have to fly at around 25,000ft to avoid damaging building with its sonic boom - just like the @entity142 jet in the original @entity143 it would have to be a lot bigger and - most important - it would have to protect its passengers from the intense heat created by the plane ’s extraordinary speed as it passes through the atmosphere			1
@entity51 flew no faster than @entity151 , primarily because the materials were n’t available in the @entity153 that could withstand greater heat			1
technology has advanced since then , and the @entity40 will be a so - called ‘ warm structure ’ - it will heat up rather than reflect the heat with the sort of ceramic tiles that covered the @entity159			1
there ’s also the noise to consider			0
@entity51 was n’t allowed to fly supersonic over land because of the ‘ sonic boom ’ - the sound associated with the shockwaves created by a craft moving faster than the speed of sound			1
according to experts , if a passenger jet flew at @entity49 at current jet altitudes of around 30,000ft , the sonic boom could damage buildings			1
so how high might a hypersonic passenger jet have to fly , and how long might it take to get around the skies ? believe it or not , dr @entity105 refers me to the very first episode of the children ’s tv series @entity143 , in which the brave puppets of @entity143 have to deal with a bomb on board a hypersonic airliner , the @entity142			1
‘ the episode was made in 1964 , but they got it right in so many ways , ’ he says			0
‘ it flew from @entity2 to @entity4 in two hours at @entity49 , which is surprisingly accurate if you allow for acceleration at the start and deceleration at the end			1
’ the @entity142 flew at about 250,000ft - still within the @entity197 ’s atmosphere - and dr @entity105 reckons this , too , could be about the perfect altitude			0
it would be sufficiently high to cut down the heat generated because the atmosphere is colder and thinner			0
as for the flying experience , cocooned inside their pressurised cabin , hypersonic passengers would probably experience little that was different from flying today			2
acceleration might be a little faster on take - off with the plane taking about 23 minutes to reach @entity151 6			2
clearly , there would n’t be much time for films , and the crew would have to be quick with the drinks trolley and duty frees			0
one major difference : for heat protection , there might not be any windows - even in the cockpit , where pilots would have to fly by computer			2
and what about the question that would surely be uppermost in passengers ’ minds : would it be safe to travel at almost 5,000mph ? @entity227 has said its @entity229 craft designed for space tourism could also be adapted into a passenger jet , allowing travel from @entity2 to @entity233 in two hours but would rely on gravity in orbit , rather than engines , to reach its destination @entity51 suffered only one major accident , but it was catastrophic - the 2000 @entity241 disaster in which all 109 people on board died after the plane hit a piece of debris on the runway as it took off from @entity248			1
‘ if anything goes wrong , it ’s going to go wrong very quickly , and the potential for disaster is that much greater , ’ warns dr @entity105			0
‘ if something breaks the plane ’s skin , at that sort of speed the airflow is so powerful it can start tearing chunks off the plane and it would disintegrate very quickly			0
’ and there ’d be no room for a malfunctioning air con system or passengers would start to cook			1
aeronautical experts admit this is all uncharted territory - even the @entity159 reached such high temperatures only for a few minutes as it re-entered @entity197 ’s atmosphere			0
it ’s also hard to say how much it might cost to fly hypersonic			0
ticket prices will inevitably depend on how many passengers a plane can carry - so the more it can hold , the more commercially viable the flight			2
@entity51 had room for only 100 passengers , but it was limited by @entity153 technology			1
experts say there is no reason why a hypersonic jet could n’t take up to 300 passengers			2
not that it will look as pretty as a conventional jetliner , and certainly not as sleek as @entity51			2
it ’s more likely , says dr @entity105 , that the wings would blend into the fuselage more closely and that it would have a stubby shape to cope with the huge air pressures			0
but despite the excitement in the voices of aeronautical professionals , @entity294 , @entity295 ’s former chief concorde pilot , has been saying for years that a hypersonic passenger jet just wo n’t fly as an idea , and he ’s not changing his tune now			1
‘ i know how difficult it was to design and build @entity51 and that was far more do - able , ’ he tells me			2
‘ it ’s simply not practical for anything bigger than a small spy plane , ’ he insists			1
maintenance could also be an issue , says @entity294			0
‘ imagine the @entity159 being turned around in an hour and being sent off again			0
that ’s the size of the problem			0
’ the industry does n’t appear to share his views : aircraft giant @entity314 is also researching hypersonic flight and calls it , in a nod to @entity317 , the ‘ warp speed of today ’			0
the @entity319 believed travelling at more than 30mph would make the human body collapse			0
what they would have made of technology that could propel people at 150 times that velocity is anyone ’s guess .			2

@entity19 is developing engines for @entity40 spy plane
can accelerate up to @entity49 , 4,567mph , three times faster than @entity51
the technology could be adapted into a passenger jet , but faces problems
there would be not windows on the plane to reduce drag
a single tear in the outside could mean it disintegrates , and a *failure* in the air con would cause passengers to cook
however if successful it would mean @entity2 to @entity4 in two hours
