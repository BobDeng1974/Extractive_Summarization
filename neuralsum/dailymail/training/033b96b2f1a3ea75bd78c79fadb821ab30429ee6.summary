@entity0 has received a complaint from one of her constituents after sending him an @entity5 card despite the fact that he is not a muslim a @entity9 mp has infuriated one of her constituents by twice sending him a card celebrating an @entity13 festival even though he is not a @entity7			1
@entity0 , a key aide to party leader @entity14 , admitted that her staff went through the electoral register picking out people with ‘ @entity13 ’ names – a practice that could be in breach of the @entity21			2
@entity22 , 52 , who was born into the ancient @entity24 faith of @entity25 , first complained when he received an @entity5 card from her in 2009			1
the @entity28 mp apologised and promised him it would not happen again – but then she sent him another greeting to mark the @entity13 feast day at the beginning of the week			0
mr @entity22 , a businessman from @entity33 , @entity34 , said the @entity9 politician ’s use of his personal information raised data protection concerns			1
‘ i was born a @entity25 , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’m not anti-islamic , it ’s just that i ’m not @entity7			2
clearly they have just looked up my name			0
’ miss @entity0 told mr @entity22 in 2009 that the 7,000 cards she sent out that year to mark @entity5 – which celebrates the end of @entity44 , the @entity13 month of fasting – were intended only for @entity7 , although she confirmed at least two other recipients had complained			1
‘ my offices have no special access to data on resident ’s religion , ’ she wrote			0
‘ we made an error on the basis of your surname being an @entity13 one			0
‘ for this i again sincerely apologise			0
the vast majority of the cards sent out via surnames on the electoral register were sent to @entity7 households and were welcomed			2
’ following a complaint by mr @entity22 , miss @entity0 was warned by the @entity64 in 2010 that she had probably breached the @entity21 and should not send any more @entity5 cards to constituents ‘ merely on the basis of an assumption about their names ’			1
on that occasion she was warned that she had likely breached data protection rules mr @entity22 , whose name is of expatriate @entity78 origin , said : ‘ the mistake should n’t have been made again			1
’ miss @entity0 , who is mr @entity14 ’s parliamentary private secretary , said she believed constituents welcome the @entity82 , @entity5 and @entity83 [ @entity83 ] cards she sends each year			1
but @entity85 mp @entity84 said : ‘ the idea that you can win elections by this kind of vacuous , politically correct , cynical tactic is wrong			0
‘ i rather hope that elections are determined by what you believe in and what you do for your local community			0
i think many @entity7 will find this approach to win votes rather patronising			0

@entity0 sent @entity5 card to male constituent named @entity22
mr @entity22 complained because he is not a @entity7 , and follows @entity25
he says the same thing happened in 2010 when he also wrote to complain
