this is the university equality officer at the centre of a sexism and racism row pictured in front of a ' no white men ' sign showing their tears dripping into a cup			1
a picture of @entity10 , 27 , student union @entity11 at @entity12 in @entity13 , pretending to cry was posted online as she was being accused of discrimination			1
the handmade poster also refers to a ban on ' cis ' or cisgender men , a term used of those whose mental gender and physical sex match , which is the opposite of transgender			2
message : this picture of @entity10 , the student union welfare and diversity officer at @entity12 , shows her posing in front if a ' no white men ' sign while pretending to cry row : ms @entity10 appeared to ban men and white people from attending the meeting in this @entity34 post the photograph first appeared on miss @entity10 's @entity34 profile on tuesday , six days after she told white people and men ' not to come ' to a meeting she was organising to discuss ' diversifying the curriculum '			1
she wrote on @entity34 last week : ‘ invite loads of @entity43 [ black and minority ethnic ] women and non-binary people ! ! also , if you ’ve been invited and you ’re a man and / or white @entity46 just cos i invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a @entity43 women and non-binary event only			1
’ non-binary is a term used to describe people who do not consider themselves exclusively male or female			0
miss @entity10 , 27 , added : ‘ do n’t worry lads we will give you and allies things to do ’ , followed by a wink			1
the event ’s online page said it was open to ‘ self - defining @entity63 women and non-binary people with gender identities that include “ woman ”			0
’ a notice about the meeting later appeared to show the ban had been dropped , stating : ' allies now welcome ! ' miss @entity10 , pictured at a demonstration , describes herself as a ‘ queer , anti-racist feminist killjoy ’ and previously organised a ' @entity75 ’ before showing the film @entity76 the post was met with outrage by students of the university , one of whom described the exclusive policy as ' patronising beyond belief '			1
the story was covered by student newspaper @entity86 just hours after miss @entity10 first posted the image			1
@entity89 ' union eventually backed down after a backlash from students			2
the ban on men and white students is surprising , since the organisers claim to promote ‘ zero tolerance ’ for ‘ all forms of prejudice , discrimination and oppression ’			1
a senior union member told student newspaper @entity86 that miss @entity10 ’s actions had made it ‘ very difficult ’ for male students			1
in the hours after the story made national news yesterday , a friend of miss @entity10 again posted the picture of her pretending to cry to @entity34			1
he wrote : ' when you thought the cup in the picture was big enough for white tears '			1
in february , miss @entity10 , whose @entity115 biography says she is ‘ queer , anti-racist feminist killjoy ’ , also organised a ' @entity75 ’ before showing the film @entity119			2
today her friends posted supportive messages on her @entity34 page and also offered her a place to stay if she needed it			2
but not everyone was so supportive			0
one @entity34 friend , called @entity126 , wrote : ' you do not speak for me			2
i voted you into the position of @entity131			0
' your passion is inspiring			0
but i ca n't defend this			0
we can not best " them " by being them			0
we can not demand to be included by excluding			0
' to specifically exclude a group of people from any event is to become the oppressor			0
as the oppressed , we should not wish to inflict upon others that pain which we know to be harmful to us			0
' this is not the @entity89 i love '			0
@entity10 , student union welfare and diversity officer at @entity12 in @entity13 , sparked anger when she banned men and white people from a ' diversity ' meeting graduate : miss @entity10 recently completed an @entity152 in gender and media studies and won election to become the union 's @entity131 miss @entity10 recently graduated from @entity89 with an @entity152 in gender and media studies			1
criticism : critics have said that miss @entity10 ’s actions had made it ‘ very difficult ’ for male students but friends have also defended her she is understood to live with her mother @entity163 , 55 , father @entity164 , 57 , and sister @entity165 , 23 , in @entity166 in a £ 450,000 three - bedroom terrace			1
the @entity168 tried to contact miss @entity10 but she was not available to explain the comments apparently posted from her @entity34 account			1
a friend told @entity172 she ' does not want to talk to you '			0
yesterday a spokesman for @entity89 said the university had no part in the decisions of the union , adding : ‘ we are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression , including racism , sexism or any other form of bigotry			2
‘ we have written to the students ’ union to express our concern			2
’ the union said : ‘ @entity191 places huge importance on equality and diversity			2
‘ it is in this vein that we host spaces where specific minority groups who experience similar discrimination can talk together confidently about overcoming the structural disadvantages and prejudice they face			0
‘ the accusation that we discriminate is one we refute wholeheartedly '			0
@entity89 has insisted the @entity205 is a separate organisation over which it has no control			0
