click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game as @entity4 made marauding runs down the left - hand side at least @entity7 could see the funny side			1
as he sat down to take his last press conference in this current stint as @entity14 manager , the players of @entity10 appeared on a large television screen with the trophy he knows so well			1
‘ can someone switch that off , please , ’ he said , only half joking			0
what strange times these are for @entity7 and the club he has served for most of his life			1
moments earlier he was part of the contingent that walked to the corner of the ground where the away fans were singing and dancing			0
perhaps predictably , missing out on the @entity28 was not met with grief			1
maybe there were other reasons for the joy			0
the end of suffering in a humiliating season , most likely			1
and it was also the end of an era			1
subs not used : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 booked : @entity68 , @entity67 , @entity4 @entity14 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity79 6 ; smalling 6 , @entity80 5 , @entity81 4.5 , @entity82 5.5 ; @entity83 6 , @entity84 4.5 ( @entity85 46 , 6 ) ; @entity86 6.5 , @entity40 6.5 ( @entity87 89 ) , @entity88 5.5 ; @entity89 4 ( @entity90 68 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 booked : @entity81 , @entity86 att : 31,372 @entity96 : @entity4 ref : @entity97 5 player ratings by @entity99 at @entity52 not so much the era of @entity14 ’s dominance – that ship hoisted anchor before @entity104			1
but what of the cogs , men like @entity7 and his class - mates from 1992 ? @entity7 had nothing new to say on that score after the game			2
‘ i think the managerial situation will be sorted next week and i will need to think about my own position , ’ he said			0
with @entity115 ’s intentions towards the existing staff not totally clear , that is a position in limbo			0
‘ i need to decide whether to play on , stay on in the staff - and what position that is going to be - or take a year off football , ’ @entity7 said			2
and what of @entity80 , whose contract is up ? his waving at the end appeared more of a goodbye than a ‘ see you later ’			1
they have good memories at @entity14			2
a cruel person might say they ’ll need them			0
but in any case , they were remembering vidic the colossus			0
he was dreadful on sunday and has often looked poor since announcing he is off to @entity139			0
but they love him and , at the moment , history is all they have			0
there is no telling how long these supporters will have to wait			0
@entity7 says ‘ there is a lot to look forward to ’ , and channelled ‘ the positives ’ , namely that @entity14 ’s first season without @entity152 football since the @entity154 bans of the @entity155 will be a good thing			1
bloodied in battle : @entity14 captain @entity81 was hurt in a challenge with @entity50 goodbye , @entity81 : it was @entity81 's last game for @entity14 before his move to @entity139 this summer class of ' 92 : @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity7 and @entity165 watch on from the sidelines ‘ it might help with our league form and cup runs , ’ he said			1
‘ if we do well in the cups it gets the amount of games up and everyone gets a chance because we need to keep a squad for when we get back in @entity152 next year			0
’ but @entity7 is an optimist			2
this performance , as if further proof were needed , showed the stark limitations of the side			0
within five minutes , one of @entity81 ’s touches went straight into touch			2
two minutes later he clearly handled in his area and , shortly before the half - hour , he was left covered in blood from an incident that led to @entity50 ’s opener			1
the @entity55 striker elbowed @entity81 as they contested an aerial ball – it did not appear to be malicious – but @entity97 incorrectly opted against giving @entity14 a free - kick			1
@entity71 then played in @entity50 to score his 13th league goal of a fine season , before @entity40 levelled with a delightful free - kick			1
@entity198 : @entity86 attempts to jink past @entity58 midfielder @entity199 skill : @entity72 races away from fellow @entity202 @entity85 great job : @entity204 has been linked with a move to take over at @entity206 for next season @entity4 was brilliant at left back in front of @entity209 and is going to @entity210			1
@entity58 team - mate @entity72 impressed in midfield as well			2
@entity50 scored for @entity58 but was generally quiet			1
@entity14 ’s @entity88 and @entity212 struggled to make an impact but @entity85 ’s arrival as a substitute helped turn the game in his team ’s favour			2
of course , @entity58 now face their own period of uncertainty			2
@entity204 continues to sidestep direct questions about his future , with @entity206 looming			0
‘ i still have one year on my contract and it is normal that these rumours crop up , ’ he said , as he always does			0
he was marginally more effusive in his appraisal of a stunning season			0
‘ the way we played throughout , they way we took eighth place , this makes me proud , ’ he said			0
but @entity58 are looking at a near future that quite feasibly will not include @entity72 , @entity4 or their manager			1
those will be huge losses			0
but they are still on an up - slope			0
it ’s been a long year since @entity14 could say the same			2
emotional : @entity81 bids farewell to the fans after the game strong tackle : @entity81 goes up for an aerial duel with @entity68 ... putting his leg high @entity55 duo : @entity88 tracks back to try and stop the in - form @entity50 cleared out : @entity4 executes a perfect sliding tackle on @entity247 overlapping : @entity63 gets down the right - hand side to whip in a cross past @entity40 final @entity251 look : @entity209 was at @entity43 's to check up on his young @entity55 stars end of an error : @entity14 fans present a banner in the stands in @entity58			1

draw means @entity14 miss out on @entity28
@entity81 covered in blood after clash with @entity50
end of an era with @entity81 leaving and @entity80 set to go
@entity14 's *caretaker* manager @entity7 in limbo
@entity58 facing uncertain future , too , with players and boss in demand
@entity14 end season in *seventh* , @entity58 in eighth
