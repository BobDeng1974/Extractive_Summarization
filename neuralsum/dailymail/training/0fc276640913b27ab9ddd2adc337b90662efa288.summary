remember the famous chestbuster scene from classic 1979 film @entity1 , when a parasitic alien burst out of @entity4 's stomach ? well , this horrific video shows something similar , but real			1
it shows a man spraying a praying mantis with pesticide , killing it instantly , only to see seconds later a huge worm bursting out of the body of the dead insect and wriggling across the floor			1
but seconds later something can be seen moving at the rear of the insect and then a huge worm almost as big as the praying mantis that it was infecting bursts out and wriggles across the floor			1
experts shown the video by @entity42 newspaper @entity41 said it was clearly a parasite that had been eating the praying mantis alive from the inside			1
it would have eventually been killed when the worm was ready to escape			2
they said it appeared to be a horsehair worm or @entity51			1
the praying mantis is a protected insect in @entity42 where it is extremely rare but it is not clear where the video was shot			1
the praying mantis is a protected insect in @entity42 where it is extremely rare but it is not clear where the video was shot it has been described as a real - life enactment of the famous scene from @entity1 when a man sprayed the praying mantis with pesticide , killing it instantly , only to see seconds later a huge worm bursting out of the body of the dead insect the video was posted last may but only went viral this week			1
the experts said that nematomorph hairworms do not just colonise the belly of their hosts , they eat them alive causing erratic behaviour that can make the insects to fall into water - perfect for the parasite as they need water to reproduce			2
in 2002 , researchers investigated anecdotal reports of insects infected with the parasite ' committing suicide ' by jumping into water			0
the researchers compared the behaviour of crickets infected with the worm against uninfected crickets , and found the infected ones were more likely to jump into the water			0
water is fatal for the crickets , but the parasite relies on the water to reproduce			0
the worms can grow to two metres long , and the adults live freely in water , but the larvae are parasitic on various insects and crustaceans			0
some of viewers on @entity98 expressed doubts about the authenticity of the video , but professor @entity102 from the @entity103 said it 's a fairly common phenomenon			0
he said : ' i am pretty sure that this is real , and not a hoax			0
i have seen and photographed similar things a number of times			0
' @entity111 , who is also a senior curator of entomology at the @entity113 , said the worm was likely tightly packed inside the abdomen of the insect until the insect died			2
' and yes , they do look very long , but they are very skinny , ' he wrote .			0

@entity42 video shows a man spraying a praying mantis with pesticide
the insect dies instantly , but then a worm living inside it comes out
experts said parasite had been eating the insect alive from inside
the worm is *believed* to be a horsehair worm or @entity51
