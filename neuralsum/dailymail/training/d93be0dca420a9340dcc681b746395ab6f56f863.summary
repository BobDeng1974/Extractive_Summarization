by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 12:16 est , 12 november 2012 future : @entity1 leaves his home today and admits that the future of @entity4 is in doubt the future of @entity4 is hanging in the balance after @entity1 admitted its botched report that falsely accused @entity10 peer @entity8 of being a paedophile could see it scrapped after 32 years			1
the @entity14 chairman @entity1 and acting director general @entity15 will meet today to discuss if the programme can survive the corporation 's crisis			1
@entity4 was first broadcast in january 1980 but in the past year it has been badly damaged by its decision not to run an investigation into @entity23 's abuse of children and now the smearing of @entity8			1
when @entity1 was asked if the show will survive he said : ' that 's one of the things we will be discussing with the acting director - general today			1
' i think one of the things that should survive is the investigative journalism which it has represented along with @entity36			1
' at the heart of our news offering has to be uncompromising investigative journalism but you have to get it right			2
' @entity43 , chairman of the culture and media select committee , said : ' @entity4 has been very badly damaged by this , and maybe it will need to re-branded			2
but the @entity14 will need to continue to have a flagship news and current - affairs programme ' @entity4 has already been wounded by its decision not to air an investigation it commissioned last year into the criminal activities of the late @entity23			2
last month , following a decision by @entity55 to screen the allegations , @entity4 editor @entity53 ' stepped aside ' pending the outcome of a review by @entity59			2
two more senior @entity14 staff today ' stepped aside ' at the crisis - hit @entity61 as the fallout continues after a botched @entity4 investigation			0
then and now : @entity4 started in january 1980 with @entity65 ( left during first show ) and is now presented by stars including @entity68 @entity70 director @entity69 and her deputy @entity71 follow @entity4 editor @entity53 , who also ' stepped aside ' last month following a shelved probe into @entity23 's sex abuse			1
meanwhile stalwart presenter @entity68 provoked fears he will quit @entity4			0
should @entity14 's @entity4 be scrapped ? the fiery presenter blamed ' cowards and incompetents ' for the departure of director general @entity79 as he damned a culture of ' timeserving ' and ' biddable ' managers			1
his embittered response raised fears that he will leave the programme , where he is known for his combative questioning and refusal to tolerate evasive politicians			0
even staff on the programme are beginning to question whether it will be able to survive the crisis			0
one @entity14 insider asked whether , following two separate reviews into the programme , ' it would be the kind of brand you want to be associated with '			0
others believe a brief suspension is possible – until at least after @entity99 – while the mess is cleared up and a new team installed			0
former @entity4 presenter @entity65 said last night : ' it is a brilliant programme			0
it produces wonderful stuff and has done successfully for 32 years			1
to end @entity4 would be absurd			0
but i 'm afraid @entity4 have made mistakes and of course they are going to have to suffer for that			0

@entity1 to meet acting director general @entity15 to decide if it will be axed after 32 years
