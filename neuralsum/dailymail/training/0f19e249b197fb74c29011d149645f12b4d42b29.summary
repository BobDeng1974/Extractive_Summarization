two strange , cloud - like plumes reaching high above the surface of @entity2 are causing a stir among scientists			1
on two separate occasions in march and april 2012 , amateur astronomers reported definite plume - like features developing on the planet			1
the plumes were seen rising to altitudes of over 155 miles ( 250 km ) above the same region of @entity2 , and could help explain what makes up the @entity2 atmosphere			1
a mysterious plume - like feature , marked with yellow arrow , at the limb of @entity2 on 20 march 2012.the image is shown with the north pole towards the bottom and the south pole to the top the phenomenon was observed on march 12 , 2012 over the ' terminator ' , which is the boundary between day and night on @entity2			1
one of the plumes developed in around 10 hours and lasted for 11 days , shifting shape from ' double blob protrusions ' to pillars which merged into a ' finger ' shape			1
a second was spotted nearby on april 6 , 2012 , and lasted about 10 days			1
' at about 155 miles ( 250 km ) , the division between the atmosphere and outer space is very thin , so the reported plumes are extremely unexpected , ' says @entity37 of the @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 , who led the study			1
the phenomenon was observed on march 12 , 2012 over the ' terminator ' , which is the boundary between day and night on @entity2			2
the top images show the location of the mysterious plumes on @entity2 , identified within the yellow and red circle			0
the bottom images show different views of the changing plume shape one of the plumes developed in around 10 hours and lasted for 11 days , shifting shape from ' double blob protrusions ' to pillars which merged into a ' finger ' shape			1
pictured are the 2012 plume events ( ringed ) on 22 march and 13 april the plumes could be made of particles of water or carbon dioxide , said the paper published in the journal @entity62			1
alternatively , it could be an aurora , similar to the shimmering light show that develops in @entity66 's atmosphere when solar particles collide with @entity66 's magnetic field			0
past surveillance by scientific orbiters have suggested @entity71 to have a ' strip ' with a strong but localised magnetic field			0
if this is the case , the @entity2 ' aurora ' would be a remarkable 1,000 times brighter than its terrestrial equivalent			0
but ' both explanations defy our current understanding of @entity2 ' upper atmosphere ' , the scientists admit			2
their trails were vast , extending between 310 miles and 620 miles ( 500 and 1,000 km ) in north - to - south and east - to - west directions			1
the ' clouds ' were seen at high altitude , at about 155 miles ( 250km ) , roughly above @entity71 , which is part of @entity2 ' rugged southern highlands , according to the paper			2
@entity2 is being scrutinised for signs of water and volcanic activity , both of which could theoretically nurture some form of life			0
clouds of dust or ice crystals have been spotted occasionally over @entity2 in the past			2
but they have never been as extensive as the latest two , and they always formed at an altitude below 100km			0
none of the spacecraft orbiting @entity2 saw the features because of their viewing geometries and illumination conditions at the time			0
however , checking archived @entity108 images taken between 1995 and 1999 and of databases of amateur images spanning 2001 to 2014 revealed occasional clouds at the limb of @entity2 , albeit usually only up to 62 miles ( 100km ) in altitude			2
@entity2 with the plume at limb identified within the yellow circle , and at right , augmented views of the changing plume shape			0
on the background an area on @entity71 on @entity2 where the plume formed but one set of @entity108 images from 17 may 1997 revealed an abnormally high plume , similar to that spotted by the amateur astronomers in 2012			2
scientists are now working on determining the nature and cause of the plumes by using the @entity108 data in combination with the images taken by amateurs			0
the plumes could be made of particles of water or carbon dioxide , said the paper published in the journal @entity62			1

the plumes were spotted on two occasions , in march and april 2012
one of the plumes developed in around 10 hours and lasted for 11 days
their trails extended between 310 miles and 620 miles ( 500 and 1,000 km )
one theory is that they are clouds of carbon dioxide or water particles
another is they are the @entity2 *version* of @entity183 and @entity184 lights
plumes could help scientists better understand the @entity2 atmosphere
