new ‘ @entity13 ’ or 4k televisions have four times as many pixels and a higher price tag than an ordinary hd tv , but in many cases , the human eye can not notice the difference , they said			1
as manufacturers compete to create products with the highest number of pixels per inch ( @entity26 ) they are creating densities that surpass the limits of the human eye			1

@entity37 televisions have four times as many pixels than an ordinary hd tv , but in many cases , the human eye can not notice the difference , experts have said @entity42 , head of display - testing firm @entity43 , told @entity44 that when it comes to @entity13 technology ‘ a regular human is n’t going to see a difference ’			1
the tvs by @entity50 and @entity51 have a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 – four times that of a standard hd or ‘ retina ’ television and cost between £ 1,840 ( $ 3,000 ) and £ 15,320 ( $ 25,000 ) , with both companies claiming the sets offer a superior viewing experience			1
as manufacturers compete to provide the highest number of pixels per inch they are often creating densities that surpass the limits of the human eye similarly , the @entity64 for some smartphones have also jumped and the @entity67 and @entity68 , for example , have screens with over 400 @entity26			1
however , @entity70 , a professor of ophthalmology at @entity72 , said : ‘ there 's going to be some density beyond which you ca n't do any better because of the limits of your eye			2
’ he explained that a person ’s field of vision usually covers 200 degrees - a little bit more than a semicircle – and if you hold your arm away from your body , your fingernail measures roughly one of those degrees			0
now if you imagine your fingernail is covered with 120 alternating stripes , being able to see them is around the limit of the human eye working at its very best			1
he said that the perceived quality of a screen depends on how far away it is positioned from a viewer , so a difference in resolution for a tv set is not usually noticeable unless it is incredibly large or close to people			0
dr @entity101 of the @entity102 said he does not see the point of technology with incredible resolutions , while mr @entity42 said there is a bigger case for working on 3d technology than @entity109			1

‘ consumers will soon realise that they are n't seeing much , if any visual resolution and sharpness improvements , ‘ said mr @entity42			2
he believes ‘ quantum dot ’ technology might be the next big thing for tv and smartphone displays as it focuses on improving colour representation and contrast			0
@entity139 , a neuroscientist at @entity140 , believes progress will come in the form of screens that show more realistic light and shadow			0
‘ when you 're in a scene where there 's indoor stuff , outdoor stuff , glossy materials reflecting other lights [ ... ] that dynamic range is huge , ’ he said , but ‘ consumer - grade displays do n't get that stuff right , ' he said .			0
