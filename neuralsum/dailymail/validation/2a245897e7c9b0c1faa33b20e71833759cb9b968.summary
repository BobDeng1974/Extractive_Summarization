@entity0 fears @entity1 will qualify at the very back of the grid for sunday ’s @entity4 @entity3			1
the @entity6 driver and his team - mate @entity7 , who is deputising for the injured @entity8 , endured a miserable day during practice for the season opener at the @entity11			1
the @entity1 pair , hampered by reliability problems to their new @entity15 engine , managed only 13 laps between them in friday ’s opening session and were five seconds down on @entity20 ’s best time for @entity21			1
@entity0 cut a frustrated figure in @entity23 on friday as @entity1 struggled for pace and reliability @entity0 was almost four seconds slower than @entity20 , who set the pace for @entity21 on friday and while @entity0 managed to get more running under his belt during the second session , completing 21 laps , he was still almost four seconds down on the front - running @entity21			1
@entity7 posted four laps before losing control of his @entity1 at @entity32 and crashing into the barriers			2
@entity34 , who did n’t compete at any of the winter tests , failed to take to the track on friday , and @entity0 fears a similar no - show tomorrow will see @entity1 bring up the rear for sunday ’s curtain raiser in @entity23			1
@entity7 loses control of his @entity1 at @entity32 and runs into the gravel before crashing out the @entity41 did n't take any further part in the session with his car in bits before it was taken back to the garage ‘ i am hoping it wo n’t be the last row of the grid , ’ said @entity0 , a three - time winner in @entity23 , when asked about his hopes for qualifying			1
‘ hopefully 20 cars will run			0
it wo n’t be easy and we all know it			0
we are working as one and we are not pointing any fingers			0
we are just solving the problems as we go			0
hopefully we will be competitive sooner rather than later			0
’ @entity1 , powered by @entity15 for the first time since 1992 , had a pre-season to forget as they struggled for pace and reliability			2
and getting to the chequerd flag on sunday will now be considered a positive result for a team which has n’t tasted victory in over two years			0

‘ the important thing is to make sure we maximise everything we have and then look at timesheets in qualifying and the race , see how we fared , and how much work we have to do			2
’ mclaren are powered by @entity15 this year , but face an uphill struggle and may bring up the rear in @entity23			0
