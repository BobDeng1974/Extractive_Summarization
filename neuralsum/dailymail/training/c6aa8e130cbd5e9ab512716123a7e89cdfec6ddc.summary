the @entity0 examined the phone records of more than 1,700 journalists , lawyers and staff working for @entity5 , it has emerged @entity6 has examined the mobile phone records of more than 1,700 journalists , lawyers and staff working for @entity5 , it emerged last night			1
in a major breach of privacy laws , @entity9 handed over data from phones belonging to journalists , lawyers , secretarial staff and senior executives working for @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity21 newspapers between 2005 and 2007 to the @entity0			1
detectives working on @entity23 , which is investigating alleged payments by journalists to ‘ public officials ’ , requested data last october from the phone of one reporter who had been arrested			1
but when the telecoms giant mistakenly disclosed a mass of staff phone records , police held onto the material for seven months despite requests to return it			1
it is feared that the data could have compromised confidential journalistic sources			1
detectives conducted an analysis of the records and built a spreadsheet listing outgoing calls made from 1,757 phones , even know they knew the information relating to innocent journalists had been passed on improperly			2
the data breach is now being investigated by the privacy watchdog bodies , the information commissioner ( @entity49 ) and the interception of @entity51 ( @entity52 )			2
the latter , which is also investigating police use of surveillance powers against journalists , said the case was of ‘ very significant concern ’ and it has urged the publisher @entity5 to take up the matter with the @entity63			0
the case comes amid concerns about the extent to which police use surveillance powers under the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) against journalists and their sources			0
the @entity0 used @entity69 to find who leaked the police log of the @entity75 incident to @entity21 while @entity76 used the law to discover a journalist ’s source in the @entity81 speeding points affair			2
yesterday @entity9 said the material was ‘ a corrupted dataset ’			0
a spokesman told @entity18 : ‘ we wrote to the @entity0 to express our grave concern that the police continued to retain the data released to them in error and made it clear to them that any assumption that meaningful conclusions could be drawn from any aspect of the corrupted dataset was highly questionable			0
’ the @entity0 said it conducted an analysis on the ‘ excess data ’ to extract information about the phone contact between five more people – including journalists , lawyers and sources – who were under suspicion in police investigations into journalistic activity			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we recognised the sensitivity of the excess data provided and ensured it was retained securely , until it was returned to @entity9			0
the @entity0 consulted with the @entity108 , and the information commissioner on how this error should best be managed			0
‘ the @entity0 agreed that it would only use the material for a policing purpose , when in the interests of justice to do so , and where people were already charged and facing criminal proceedings			0
’ an @entity52 investigation has exonerated the @entity0 , blaming @entity9 for the error .			2
