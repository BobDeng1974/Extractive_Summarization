this was the jaw dropping moment a diver came face - to - face with a behemoth of a crocodile			1
fearless @entity6 was swimming in the waters off the south - east coast of @entity10 in @entity11 when he encountered this prehistoric creature			1
the reptile seemed as interested in the swimmer as the swimmer was in him and came in really close to investigate the diver and his crew			1
make it snappy : @entity6 was swimming in the waters off the south - east coast of @entity10 in @entity11 when he encountered this prehistoric creature touching tail : the diver reaches out and touches the tail of the creature			1
' the crocs do n't want to risk injury by taking us on , ' mr @entity6 said of his encounter with the massive reptiles languidly gliding through the clear waters , the crocodile is within touching distance of mr @entity31 , and seems more curious than threatened by the presence of human beings encroaching its natural habitat			1
it opens its frightful jaws wide to snap up the bait that divers dangle in front of it , gulping it down within seconds			0
but as the curios croc investigates the underwater camera , the divers stay close to the dangerous reptile , floating inches from its open mouth			2
the magnificent creature seems calm and placid , blissfully unbothered by the swimmers surrounding it			1
at one point the diver reaches out to touch the tail of the creature , holding on to it for a few seconds			2
snap happy : the curios croc investigates the underwater camera , poking its snout close to the lens head above water : the group followed safety protocols to ensure that they did n't come to any harm the camera then pans to show another crocodile , swimming up behind the first and the two glorious crocs gracefully slice through the water as their powerful bodies sway			2
the croc couple swim close together but things start to get aggressive very swiftly when one creature opens its jaws wide and tries to bite the other			0
but before it can pierce its thick scales , the crocodile snaps back and the aggressor quickly swims away this particular species , the @entity78 crocodile or @entity79 , is a rare sight in this particular area of @entity11			1
according to crocodile website crocodilian.com , there have only been 42 @entity78 crocodile sightings in @entity10			1
mr @entity31 wrote on his @entity87 page that the crocodiles would would have tried to have eaten the swimmers , if they had been given a chance croc fighting : things start to get aggressive very swiftly when one creature opens its jaws wide and tries to bite the other mr @entity31 , who works for @entity95 , wrote about the experience on his @entity87 page			2
' if given the chance they would maybe try to eat us			0
they have existed for millions of years because of their caution , they only expel energy when energy is to be gained ( prey ) , ' he posted			0
' our posture in the water puts us above them			0
to them we appear larger , taller , and with our huge camera dome ports we theorise they look like a giant intimidating eye			0
' the crocs do n't want to risk injury by taking us on			0
if you turn your back on one , put yourself at a disadvantage , stumble and make yourself an easy target , they would immediately lunge and make a meal out of you			0
' safety protocols in the water are strictly followed to prevent such an incident			0
