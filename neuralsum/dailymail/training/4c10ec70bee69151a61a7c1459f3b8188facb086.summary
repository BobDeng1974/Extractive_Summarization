by @entity0 published : 14:56 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 14:59 est , 31 october 2013 off the hook : @entity2 was arrested in 2010 for sending sexually - explicit text messages and pictures to a former student of his , but likely wo n't face prosecution with the @entity8 ruling the highest court in @entity10 has ruled that while it 's illegal to engage in sexual activities with a minor , it 's ok to talk about it with them			1
state lawyers who argued in favor of keeping the 2005 statute said that without it ' perverts will be free to bombard our children with salacious emails and text messages , and parents and law enforcement would be unable to stop it '			1
but the @entity28 ruled unanimously that the law is in violation of the @entity31 right to free speech			2
state laws are able to limit the @entity31 right to free speech but only if they serve a compelling state interest and are narrowly drawn to limit their impact			2
in her opinion , judge @entity37 , explained that the law met the compelling state interest in protecting children from child predators			2
but the law was n't narrowly written enough and instead covered ' a whole cornucopia of " titillating talk " or " dirty talk , " including sexually explicit literature such as " @entity47 , " " @entity48 , " " @entity49 " and @entity51 's " @entity50			0
" ' judge @entity37 listed other examples of ' sexually explicit television shows , movies and performances ' that would be illegal under the law , such as @entity61 's @entity60 performance in which she exposed her right breast , and @entity64 ' recent appearance on the 2013 @entity65			1
unconstitutional : the @entity8 ruled that the 2005 statute was in violation of the @entity31 right to free speech			1
they said it was too general and could be applied to books like ' @entity48 ' ( left ) and @entity64 ' recent @entity65 performance ( right ) ' in sum , everything ( the law ) prohibits and punishes is speech and is either already prohibited by other statutes - such as obscenity , disturbing harmful materials to minors , solicitation of a minor , or child pornography - or is constitutionally protected , ' she wrote			0
one man probably celebrating the ruling is former - teacher @entity2 of @entity86 , @entity10 who was arrested in 2010 after sending sexual text messages and pictures to a former student			1
@entity2 's attorney , @entity90 , believes the 53 - year - old is now off the hook			1
the court dismissed a pending indictment against @entity2 in their decision			0
his trial had been delayed while the law 's constitutionality was challenged			0
' parents have the job of dealing with this			0
this is not the government 's job , ' @entity90 told the @entity105			0
' keep track of who your kids are communicating with and teach your kids what 's appropriate and what 's not			0

the @entity8 ruled *yesterday* that a 2005 statute prohibiting salacious communications to minors is illegal
in the unanimous decision , judge @entity37 wrote that it was a violation of the @entity31 right to free speech
one *winner* is 53 - year - old @entity2 who was arrested in 2010 for sending sexually - explicit text messages to a former student
@entity2 's attorney believes that the charges against his *client* will now be dropped
