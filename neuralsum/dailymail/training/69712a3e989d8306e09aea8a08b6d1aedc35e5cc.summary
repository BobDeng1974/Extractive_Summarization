by @entity0 published : 06:54 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 09:43 est , 26 september 2013 a photographer got a little too close to the action when he nearly got bitten by a caiman during a rescue mission			1
the reptile had got stuck in a swimming pool at a lodge in @entity8 , @entity9 , and staff attempted to save it by pulling it out of the water by the tail			1
wildlife guide and photographer @entity15 rushed to assist , but escaped with barely an inch to spare when the animal launched itself teeth first towards his legs			2
too close for comfort : @entity15 is nearly bitten by the caiman as it bares its teeth after being pulled out of the pool at @entity26 in @entity8 , @entity9 the 10ft reptile had gotten stuck in the pool at @entity26 in @entity8 , where mr @entity15 , from @entity29 , was staying with a group he was guiding			1
@entity29 - based @entity15 explains : ‘ i was alerted by one of my tour clients after breakfast that an adult caiman was at the bottom of the pool			1
’ the creature had got himself stuck and local guide @entity39 and @entity40 from the lodge did their best to help free it from its chlorine - based incarceration			0
’ it proved very hard and also dangerous as a bite from this ten foot close relative of the crocodile would be more than a little graze			0
' helping hands : the caiman was discovered in the lodge 's pool and staff and guests immediately came to its aid see you later alligator : after trying several different methods , the staff concluded that they needed to pull the caiman out of the pool by hand - tail first tail end : the 10ft reptile struggled as its rescuers began to pull it by its tail ’ this is a heavy animal so once i realised it was a struggle i got involved but it twisted out of our grasp			1
’ it was not until i saw the photos that i realised it was that close to biting me			0
’ eventually it was freed and skulked down to a nearby shrunken pool to go fishing , it seemed the caiman was unimpressed by the whole ordeal			0
’ caimans hail from the alligator family and closely resembles its cousins in appearance			0
the caimans , native to @entity91 , are generally smaller than alligators , and normally grow to be between four and six feet			0
taking a risk : a helpful mr @entity15 comes around to lend a hand to free the caiman , moving dangerously close to its front @entity99 edge : as he leans in , the caiman launches itself towards him with an open mouth , ready to take a chunk out of his leg			2
