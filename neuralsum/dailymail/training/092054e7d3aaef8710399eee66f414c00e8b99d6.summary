by @entity0 published : 09:37 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 10:51 est , 2 february 2013 a shocking video showing the moment a naked @entity4 protestor was dragged across the ground and beaten by riot police has sparked outrage			2
middle - aged @entity8 was stripped bare and coated in soot before he was pulled across the floor by a team of around six helmeted officers and attacked with truncheons			1
the brutal attack , which took place as police dragged mr @entity8 towards an armoured van close to the presidential palace in @entity19 was shown on television , to the horror of angry viewers			1
the attack followed eight days of protests which have killed nearly 60 people , and has been called the deadliest wave of bloodshed of president @entity43 's seven - month rule			1
his opponents say it proves that he has chosen to order a brutal crackdown like that carried out by @entity56 against the uprising that toppled him in 2011			0
' @entity43 has been stripped bare and has lost his legitimacy			1
done , ' tweeted @entity59 , founder of the april 6 youth movement that helped launch the @entity62 protests			0
another protester was shot dead on friday and more than 100 were injured , many seriously , after running battles between police and demonstrators who attacked the palace with petrol bombs			0
that unrest followed eight days of violence that saw dozens of protesters shot dead in the @entity73 city of @entity74 and @entity43 respond by declaring a curfew and state of emergency there and in two other cities			1
riot : an @entity4 armored riot police van of the @entity81 is lit up by laser pointers used by protesters during clashes in @entity19 flames : some of the tents of @entity4 protesters after an anti-government protest near the @entity89 presidential palace but none of the bloodshed - which the authorities have blamed on the need for police to control violent crowds - has quite resonated like the images of police abusing a man at their feet - clearly helpless , prone and no possible threat			2
' stripping naked and dragging an @entity4 is a crime that shows the excessive violence of the security forces and the continuation of its repressive practices - a crime for which the president and his interior minister are responsible , ' liberal politician @entity110 said on @entity111			1
the incident was an unmistakable reminder of the beating of a woman by riot police on @entity117 in december 2011			0
images of her being dragged and stomped on - her black abaya cloak torn open to reveal her naked torso and blue bra - became a rallying symbol for the revolution and undermined the interim military rulers who held power between @entity56 's fall and @entity43 's rise			1
the rise of @entity43 - the first freely elected leader in @entity4 's 5,000 - year history - is probably the single most important change achieved by two years of revolts across the @entity135 world			1
but seven months since taking office , he has failed to unite @entity4			0
street unrest and political instability threaten to render the most populous @entity135 state ungovernable			2
demonstrate : a @entity4 protester runs through clouds of smoke and tear gas during clashes with riot police protest : a demonstrator holds a smoke flare outside the @entity148 the latest round of violence was triggered by the second anniversary of the uprising against @entity56 and death sentences handed down last week in @entity74 over a soccer stadium riot			2
@entity43 has had little opportunity to reform the police and security forces he inherited from @entity56 and the military men			1
but the police action against protests this time has been far deadlier than it was even a few months ago , when bigger crowds demonstrated against a new constitution			0
that suggests to opponents that @entity43 has ordered a tougher response			1
' the instructions of the interior minister to use excessive violence in confronting protesters does not seem like surprising behaviour given the clear incitement by prominent figures in the presidency , and leaders of the @entity176 to which the president belongs , and other parties in solidarity with them , ' said @entity181 , spokesman for the opposition @entity182			0
the liberal , leftist and secularist opposition accuses @entity43 of betraying the revolution that toppled @entity56 by concentrating too much power in his own hands and those of his @entity176 , a formerly underground @entity188 movement			2
tussle : police and protesters scuffle as protesters try to break through a palace gate @entity43 and the @entity176 accuse the opposition of stoking street unrest to further their demands for a national unity government as a way to retake power they lost at the ballot box			1
in announcing an investigation into the beating of @entity8 , @entity43 's office made clear he was still pointing the blame at the political opponents who have encouraged protests			1
' what has transpired over the past day is not political expression , but rather acts of criminality			0
the presidency will not tolerate vandalism or attacks on individuals and property			0
the police have responded to these actions in a restrained manner , ' @entity43 's office said			2
' @entity224 , in the heat of the violence , there can be violations of civil liberties , and the presidency equally will not tolerate such abuses			0
in one incident , an individual was seen to be dragged and beaten by police			0
the minister of interior has , appropriately , announced an investigation			0
