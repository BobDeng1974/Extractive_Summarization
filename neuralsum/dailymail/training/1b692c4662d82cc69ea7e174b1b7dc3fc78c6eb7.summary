by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 @entity2 shot the lowest round of the week at the @entity5 so far with a seven under par score of 65			1
@entity2 finished with a score of five under overall having started the day at two over after a mixed tournament			0
good day 's work : @entity2 ( right ) shakes hands with his caddie after the finishing the best round of the week looking good : it was a superb display from the 26 - year - old who made at least par on every hole he birdied each of the last four holes , as well as the fourth , eighth and tenth , and did n't drop a single shot in a flawless final round			1
@entity2 has a good record at the @entity5 , having finished fifth in 2008 when he was an amateur , and then tieing for third the next year			2
the 6ft 5in @entity3 was never in contention this year , however , after shooting a three over par 75 on day one			2
he recovered with a second round 70 , but a 73 on saturday halted his charge			0
getting into the swing : the @entity26 had a disappointing first three days at a competition he loves he can nonetheless take pride in an excellent round which lifted him up the leaderboard into the top 30 .			0

@entity2 finishes with four *straight* birdies to finish five under
@entity3 has good open record , with two top five finishes
poor first round this year means he was never really in contention
