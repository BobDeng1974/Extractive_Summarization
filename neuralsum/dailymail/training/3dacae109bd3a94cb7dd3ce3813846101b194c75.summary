speakers at the @entity2 's annual convention took pot shots at president @entity4 , as the man who has become the face of @entity8 's largest gun - rights group announced that the @entity2 had grown to 5 million members			1
' by the time we 're finished , that must and will be 10 million , ' said @entity2 executive vice president @entity12			2
but much of saturday 's activities at the group 's annual convention were devoted to slamming @entity4 for what speakers called failed gun control legislation for which the @entity18 has manufactured the illusion of popular support			1
he also announced that his organization had for the first time enrolled five million members @entity2 president @entity33 said @entity8 ' support for a gun - control @entity36 bill soured once they learned what was in the proposed law			1
the legislation ultimately failed despite @entity18 claims of overwhelming public support @entity43 is the order of the day at the @entity2 convention , with vendors advertising slogan - festooned signs , shirts , bumper stickers and hats the @entity18 has claimed that a massive majority of @entity8 supported the measure , which would have expanded the use of background checks before gun purchases			1
@entity4 endorsed the bill , but it failed in an april @entity36 vote			0
and many @entity58 in @entity59 have declared the gun - control season closed			1
' support for the president 's agenda began to weaken , ' @entity2 president @entity33 claimed saturday , ' as ordinary citizens began to look deeper at what was proposed			2
' @entity12 was less diplomatic , calling the bill , co-sponsored n the @entity36 by @entity69 democrat @entity68 and @entity71 @entity58 @entity70 a ' convoluted scheme tantamount to national registration of every gun owner in @entity8			0
' claiming @entity4 harbors an ' agenda to destroy our @entity76 , ' he insisted that the president ' will stop at nothing			0
then he boasted , ' that 's what he has gotten : nothing			0
' @entity18 press secretary @entity83 told reporters aboard @entity85 that as many as 23 ' executive actions ' were under consideration , which could allow @entity4 to act without @entity88 @entity4 , in @entity89 , @entity90 , may not be hearing @entity8 clearly , according to @entity12 @entity92 gov. @entity91 seemed to agree about @entity4 in a @entity94 interview published saturday			1
' his goal - well before he became president of the @entity8 - was to try to disarm the @entity8 public , ' @entity91 said			1
' he just disregards the @entity98			0
' @entity12 also blamed the @entity18 for misleading @entity8 about the content of the failed @entity36 bill			2
but ' the biggest whopper of all , ' he insisted , ' is that 90 per cent of @entity8 support his background check bill			2
during a press gaggle aboard @entity85 on friday , while en route from @entity105 to @entity90 , @entity18 press secretary @entity83 told reporters that @entity4 remains committed to ' pressing @entity88 to take action to reduce gun violence			1
' and that , @entity83 said , ' includes exploring every executive action he might be able to take ' without congressional approval			0
@entity2 lobbying chief @entity111 said gun control groups have ' spent millions on bogus polls ' - which the @entity18 then leverages politically - to create an impression that @entity8 are clamoring for firearms restrictions @entity4 's ' goal , well before he became president of the @entity8 , was to try to disarm the @entity8 public , ' said @entity92 gov. @entity91 ' we are going to press ahead , ' @entity83 added			1
' the president made clear that sometimes these efforts do nâ€™t succeed initially , but especially when you have 85 to 90 per cent of the @entity8 people supporting , in the case of background checks being expanded , a legislative proposal , this is going to get done			2
that statistic comes from a @entity131 poll conducted between march 27 and april 1			0
it found that mandatory background checks for most gun purchasers have 91 per cent of @entity8 voters , including 96 per cent of @entity136 , 88 per cent of @entity58 and 88 per cent of @entity8 in gun - owning households			1
in the same poll , 53 per cent of gun owners - the constituency gathered in @entity141 - agreed that ' universal background checks could lead to confiscation of legal guns			0
' @entity111 , executive director of the @entity145 , the group 's lobbying arm , questioned the @entity18 's number - saying that gun control groups have ' spent millions on bogus polls			2
' actor and former @entity151 drill instructor @entity149 , best known for his gunnery - sergeant role in @entity153 , told @entity154 at the @entity2 convention that president @entity4 ' does n't know who he 's fooling with ' @entity2 members are n't a shy bunch , and many wore t - shirts expressing their love for firearms - or their disdain for gun control advocates like @entity167 host @entity166 @entity12 said ' the only " 90 " the president wo n't talk about is @entity28 - his own hometown , now run by his former chief of staff			1
the president wo n't talk about @entity28 , but he should			0
because in the entire @entity8 , @entity28 rates 90th out of 90 jurisdictions in federal firearms prosecution : dead last			0
' he added that there is ' a shooting every 6.3 hours ' in the @entity28 , ' the deadliest city in @entity8 , the president 's own home town			0
' ' if the president had one clue about how to clean up violent crime , ' @entity12 said to applause , ' do n't you think he 'd do it in his own hometown ? if his policies brought us @entity28 , why would we want to listen to him on anything else ? '			0
