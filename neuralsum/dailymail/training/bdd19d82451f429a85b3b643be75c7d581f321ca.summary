by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 10:46 est , 12 december 2012 @entity3 : 10:46 est , 12 december 2012 a recently discovered asteroid gave @entity5 a close shave yesterday as it came within the moon 's orbit			2
the near - @entity5 asteroid 2012 @entity10 , which was only spotted for the first time on sunday , came within 140,000 miles of our planet the moon orbits at an average distance of 240,000 miles or so from the @entity5			1
astronomers estimate that 2012 @entity10 is about 120ft wide - big enough to cause substantial damage if it ever hits us			1
close encounter : a 60 - second exposure of @entity10 streaking through the sky on tuesday , during a flyby that brought it inside the moon 's orbit an object of similar size flattened 800 square miles of forest in @entity28 in 1908			1
' @entity29 eclipsing during an @entity5 flyby are relatively rare , ' astronomer @entity31 of the @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 , wrote on a blog on monday			0
luckily , there is thought to be no danger of it , or another recently discovered rock , hitting @entity5 - but scientists say the unique occurrence could help them learn a lot about asteroids			2
' a close analysis of the trajectory of this asteroid reveals that it will likely cross the @entity5 's shadow , causing a partial eclipse of the asteroid a few hours before reaching its minimum distance with the @entity5 , ' said @entity31 of the @entity32 , who created the animation above			0
astronomers also created this unique view of the earth - from the asteroid as it passes close by			1
this animation shows the @entity57 and the @entity5 as observed from the asteroid 2012 @entity10 , which passed close to @entity5 along with a long - studied giant space rock named @entity59			1
animation via @entity60 asteroids eclipsing during an @entity5 flyby are relatively rare , with the first known case of asteroid 2008 @entity64 which was totally eclipsed just one hour before entering @entity5 's atmosphere over @entity66 in 2008 , and asteroid 2012 @entity67 experiencing both an eclipse and a transit during the same @entity5 flyby in 2012			0
4179 @entity59 , with a shape that has been described as a ' malformed potato ' will pass 6.9 million kilometers ( 4.3 million miles ) away from @entity5 , or more than 18 times the distance from the @entity5 to the @entity74			0
four computer generated views of @entity77 based on radar images from @entity81 's @entity80 probe at 4.46 kilometers ( 2.7 miles ) long and 2.4 kilometers ( 1.5 miles ) wide , astronomers say it is considered a potentially hazardous asteroid because it makes repeated passes by the @entity5 , about every four years			2
in comparison , the asteroid that is thought to have destroyed the dinosaurs was approximately 10 km ( 6 miles ) wide			0
it 's passing will be streamed online by the @entity91 at its maximum brightness , experts say @entity59 might be barely visible through binoculars .			0

astronomers estimate that 2012 @entity10 is about 120ft wide - big enough to cause substantial damage if it ever hits us .
however , they say *impact* is *highly* unlikely
