a @entity1 convoy of trucks carrying tanks towards the @entity5 border has been seen returning without its cargo ... fuelling fears that @entity8 is already gathering his army in the country			1
the convoy of 13 military transporters had been carrying fearsome @entity14 tanks and infantry vehicles through @entity1 's @entity16 towards the border			1
the following day , the same trucks were seen returning empty			1
the images are certain to alarm the @entity21 , which fears @entity8 's forces are placing fighters and heavy weaponry across the border into rebel - held regions of @entity5			1
rebels were seen firing as they made their way through a car park , while in an area near the rebel headquarters building , residents fled when shelling began nearby			0
shops closed early , and cars with gunmen inside sped through the streets , ignoring red traffic signals			0
a few hours earlier , fighting broke out in @entity80 , a neighbourhood on the eastern edge of @entity67 that until tuesday had not seen any combat			0
a resident of @entity80 who gave his name as @entity85 said he had seen separatist fighters turning back an ambulance from the scene of the fighting , telling the crew there was no one left alive for them to treat			2
' they 're having to retreat , they 're not able to stand their ground the way they want to , ' he said of the rebels			0
the conflict has been plagued by accusations @entity1 is supplying troops and military equipment to the separatists across the border			2
number plates on seven of the trucks seen today matched those seen carrying the tanks towards the border yesterday			1
all the plates also carry the number 21 on the right hand side , indicating they are from the former @entity59 , including strife - torn @entity115 and @entity117 , which is headquartered in @entity118			0
it is now part of @entity1 's @entity61			2
the tanks and infantry fighting vehicles were seen 21 miles from the border and heading towards it			1
this is close to the frontier post where @entity1 's stalled ' humanitarian aid ' convoy is holed up			1
a man repairs a broken window in his home in @entity132 , located about 24km from @entity67 residents wait inside a makeshift bomb shelter in @entity80 as fighting breaks out across the town @entity5 forces today pressed on with their offensive in the east despite claims fleeing civilians have been killed @entity142 has refused so far to permit almost 300 trucks to enter its territory amid suspicions the vehicles - army lorries painted white - have a military purpose			1
@entity1 strongly denies this , arguing it is vital that the 2,000 tons of aid - including grain , sugar and baby food - is urgently needed in war - ravaged areas			0
the fighting in eastern @entity5 has taken a heavy human toll and has climbed today after a refugee convoy was hit by a rocket attack last night			1
fifteen bodies have so far been removed from the scene - it is understood the convoy of buses and cars was packed with civilians fleeing heavy fighting between @entity5 government forces and separatist rebels near @entity168			1
@entity5 government forces blame the attack on @entity172 separatists they are battling in the area around the rebel - held city , while the rebels have denied responsibility			1
the @entity179 says an estimated 2,086 people , including civilians and combatants , have been killed in the four - month conflict			0
that figure has nearly doubled since the end of july , when @entity5 forces stepped up their offensive and fighting started in urban areas			1
@entity168 has been largely cut off for weeks and is now in its 17th day without water and regular supplies of electricity which have hit mobile and landline phone connections			0
a statement issued by the press service of the @entity168 municipality painted a picture of misery and fear for its inhabitants			0
' overnight there was fresh shelling			0
the centre of the town has seriously suffered particularly near the central market ... as a result of the armed clashes civilians have been wounded and killed			0
there is further destruction ( of buildings ) , ' it said			0
' @entity211 is being sold from vehicles , with big queues forming ... interrupted supplies of food , medicines and fuel to @entity168 is a particularly acute problem			0
' meanwhile , president @entity8 is due to meet @entity5 president @entity219 next week for the first talks between the two in months			1
government forces have pushed on with a punishing offensive designed to win back the east a diplomatic solution would have to resolve a contradiction : with his troops advancing and victory possibly within reach , @entity219 has little incentive to offer the kind of compromises that would allow @entity8 to achieve a face - saving deal			1
the offices of the @entity5 and @entity1 presidents said both men would attend a meeting in the @entity239 capital , @entity240 , on aug. 26 , which is also to be attended by @entity243 officials , and the leaders of @entity239 and @entity245			2
officially , the meeting concerns relations between the @entity243 and a customs union involving @entity1 , @entity239 and @entity245 , but @entity5 will top the agenda			2
the meeting will be the first between @entity8 and @entity219 since a fleeting encounter in @entity250 , @entity251 , in june at commemorations of the @entity254 d - day landings			2
@entity256 officials say privately that they will keep up pressure on @entity8 to not support the rebels , but at the same time @entity5 has to be persuaded not to ruthlessly press home its advantage on the battlefield			1
that could humiliate the @entity263 and force it into an unpredictable reaction , officials say			0
the conflict , which began when street protests put a @entity268 - leading leadership in power in @entity142 against @entity271 's wishes , has dragged relations between @entity1 and the @entity21 to their worst level since the end of the @entity275			0
it has also triggered a round of trade sanctions and retaliatory measures which are hurting fragile economies both in @entity1 and in @entity243 states			0
@entity1 annexed the @entity5 region of @entity283 earlier this year			2
since then , @entity142 and its @entity268 backers say @entity1 has been arming the @entity286 rebellion in @entity1 - speaking eastern @entity5 , an allegation that @entity271 has denied			2
@entity5 forces load a @entity290 multiple rocket launcher near the eastern city of @entity292 in @entity168 @entity5 government forces and pro-russian separatists have been fighting in @entity168 for several days @entity296 soldiers passing through the trenches dug to hold their position near @entity292 @entity299 sits beside a damaged building in @entity301 , a city retaken by @entity5 forces late last month refugees pictured crossing into @entity1 from @entity5 in @entity1 's @entity118 region			1
