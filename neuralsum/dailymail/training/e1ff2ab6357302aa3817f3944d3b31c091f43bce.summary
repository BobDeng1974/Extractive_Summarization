by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam @entity3 defender @entity2 , perhaps sensing the escalation of a recent and curious epidemic , took to @entity6 on monday evening and advocated @entity7 starting yet another season under suspension			1
he wrote : ‘ still maintain that crying on the pitch should warrant a three - match ban			1
’ by then , @entity7 had just about made it down the pitch , legs shaking and chin wobbling			1
one assumes his chin was wobbling			0
it was impossible to know with any certainty because , for a matter of several minutes , his shirt was pulled over his eyes			0
broken : @entity7 was reduced to tears as @entity22 were held to a draw having lead 3 - 0 after 60 minutes hard man : @entity2 is known for his rough tackling on the pitch and his harsh words off it first when he lay on his front on the pitch , and when he made it to his haunches , then all the way to the side of the pitch as @entity36 , with the urgency of a family member at a funeral , moved to protect the privacy of last summer ’s cannibal			1
a camera was swatted away ; let @entity7 be alone at this moment of intense suffering			1
he ’s @entity7 , a rehabilitated man , and he cares deeply about this club he so very nearly left for a better option last year			1
remember the threat of a transfer request , the days he spent training with the reserves ? nine months ago to the day , he criticised the club ’s refusal to let him leave in an interview : ‘ this is about the club having agreed to something , both verbally and in the contract , which they are now not honouring			0
’ it was bitter , nasty even			0
and now the crocodile tears that are becoming increasingly common			0
in the space of a week , @entity64 has blubbed , @entity63 has shed a few and @entity66 , one of the last true hard men of @entity69 football , tried to stir a will - he , wo n’t - drama			2
speaking ahead of his last game at @entity75 last night , @entity71 ’s @entity66 , who will soon earn £ 2.5million a year after tax at @entity73 , said : ‘ you never know what ’s going to happen with emotions			2
you can try to predict but i have n’t cried yet			0
’ unstoppable : @entity79 came off the bench to score twice as @entity81 recovered to get a point inconsolable : @entity22 captain @entity36 lead @entity7 away after the end of the match at @entity85 caressed beyond : @entity7 bends around @entity2 during a @entity22 's 2 - 1 @entity86 win in march 2012 emotional : @entity64 ( left ) and @entity63 both looked drained after @entity88 's draw against @entity89 iconic : @entity91 's tears after the @entity93 semi-final defeat was the picture of the tournament then there ’s @entity63			1
what was the meaning of his tears on sunday ? is this goodbye ? has a year on the fringes heralded the end of @entity63 ’s eight - year journey at @entity88 ? a journey that , lest we forget , started when he ‘ almost crashed ’ his car because @entity109 ’s offer to keep him was only £ 55,000 a week ? football bonds are formed quickly and fickly			2
and , increasingly , it ends in tears			0
indeed , this has been the season for them			0
sometimes , they are a little more understandable			0
@entity36 ’s tears three weeks ago , after @entity22 beat @entity118 and when it looked as if they would win the @entity120 , was touching to some people , though not all			1
@entity122 , famously crying at @entity93 ( left ) , falls into the same bracket			2
but do n’t all these tears just cheapen raw , painful , tragic emotion ? one of the most moving footballing environments i have been in was @entity130 versus @entity131 on november 27 , 2011 , the day @entity127 manager @entity126 died , aged just 42			0
there , during the minute ’s silence before the match , @entity126 ’s good friend @entity132 was unable to hold back the tears ahead of kick - off			2
no - one would dare begrudge him that			2
tussle : @entity2 ( right ) playing against @entity22 's @entity139 earlier in the season you could also feel the raw devastation of @entity144 manager @entity143 at the weekend , when he broke down following the club ’s first relegation out of the @entity147 after a 94 - year stay			1
relegation means the loss of jobs , from the manager and players to the tea lady and kit man			0
less understandable is the reaction of a player who wanted to leave and who now mourns that he has fallen short of an ambition			0
if @entity7 was sad on monday night , it was for himself , for his own ambitions			1
@entity22 and their history likely had nothing to do with it			1
@entity2 ’s law might have some merit .			1

@entity2 *slammed* @entity7 on monday night
the *striker* was crying after @entity22 's dramatic 3 - 3 draw at @entity81
