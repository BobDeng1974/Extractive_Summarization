by @entity0 last updated at 8:04 am on 5th october 2011 there were tears today as villagers finally lost their battle to save a century - old tree at the heart of their community			1
despite a two - week occupation by five protesters , coming at the end of a £ 300,000 five - year legal case , the @entity10 beech is no more			1
contractors with chainsaws began felling the magnificent 55ft tree in the centre of the @entity20 village			1
behind barriers : @entity23 work started after protests from the villagers failed to save the tree			1
. the five year legal battle cost @entity28 almost £ 300,000 protected by metal barricades and five police officers , workmen lopped off its branches as the fifth and final eco-warrior climbed down in tears			1
after four nights in the tree @entity38 , 17 , stood sobbing behind the barriers as the chainsaws and clunking machinery drowned out the residents ’ last protests			1
the teenager , from @entity45 , @entity46 , said : ‘ i feel very emotional			0
the worst moment was coming down			0
i am absolutely distraught that more than a quarter of a million pounds has been spent and the tree has still not been saved			1
’ she and local residents wept , hugged each other and jeered as workmen moved in to take down the tree			2
@entity54 , 62 , who has lived in the village 22 years , said : ‘ it is the last thing i wanted to see			0
i ca n’t watch this			0
it is so very , very wrong			0
tears for the tree : the last protestor in the tree , @entity64 , is consoled as the tree is felled in @entity10 village , @entity20 ‘ the tree represented @entity68 at its best and they are just desecrating and destroying it			2
‘ this is a symbol of a rotting @entity71 and a desecration of everything we used to hold dear in this country – village life and the environment			0
’ @entity79 , 39 , who was the first to climb the tree a fortnight ago to prevent its felling , said he was ‘ absolutely appalled ’			2
‘ it is terrible news , ’ the carpenter said today			0
‘ a friend and i were offered the job of turning the stump into a bench but we would n’t touch it			2
’ mr @entity79 – dubbed the @entity91 – climbed the tree an hour before workmen were due to begin cutting it down a fortnight ago			2
when he left he was replaced by another protester , and so on , until this morning when miss @entity96 descended the tree			2
getting the axe : contractors with chainsaws began felling the magnificent 55ft tree it brought to a close a dispute that began in 2006 when @entity106 and @entity107 moved into their £ 345,000 home on @entity10 ’s @entity110			1
they said the tree , which stands by the gates to their detached home , was damaging their drive and limestone front wall and causing the drains to block			0
but their opponents called the felling ‘ wanton destruction ’ for the convenience of only two people , and asked why they had bought the house when they knew a huge tree was right outside the front gates			0
a total of 200 locals in @entity10 , which has just 150 houses , signed a petition calling for the beech tree not to be cut down and were backed by the parish council and officials at @entity134			0
before the chop : a general view of the beech tree last month , where local resident @entity79 was staging a protest in the village of @entity10 , @entity91 they issued a @entity141 , saying the loss of the beech would result in ‘ serious harm to the character of the village ’			0
because the tree is on a public grass verge it falls under the ownership of @entity28			1
despite spending £ 300,000 in legal fees to save the tree , the council was eventually forced to comply with a judge ’s order to remove it			1
taxpayers will have to pay at least £ 100,000 of the fees			1
@entity91 ’s @entity159 mp , @entity158 , said : ‘ the only people to come out of this smiling will be the lawyers who have pocketed some very fat cheques			0
’ he said the trunk would be retained as a bench and turned into ‘ the world ’s most expensive village seat ’			1
parish council vice chairman @entity167 said : ‘ we did not want to give up , but had to because of the financial cost			0
we are just a group of elderly villagers with very little clout other than what we believe in			0
’ passionate about the cause : @entity174 in late september on the third day of his vigil tyring to save a historic @entity177 tree in the village			1

the trunk of the tree is to be retained and turned into a bench
@entity28 racked up legal costs of around £ 300,000 to try and save the tree
the cost to taxpayers could be at least £ 100,000
