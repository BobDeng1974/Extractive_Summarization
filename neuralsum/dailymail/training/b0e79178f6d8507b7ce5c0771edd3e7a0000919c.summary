@entity4 @entity14 - 6.5 helpless for the opening goal but made a good save from @entity18 early in the first half and was quick off his line to deny the @entity21 after a weak @entity22 back pass			1
@entity14 was helpless to prevent a magnificent effort from @entity7 in the first half at @entity6 @entity22 ( 70 ' @entity25 ) - 4.5 gave away the free - kick that led to the opening goal and looked unsure when @entity28 attacked , even more so when he was joined by @entity7			1
his weak pass - back almost led to a one - on - one for @entity18 in the first half			0
@entity31 - 6 looked more assured after some nervy performances in recent weeks			0
he 's still not the finished article but supporters should be encouraged			0
@entity36 - 6.5 if @entity38 was hoping the defender 's time out of the side would make him hungrier , it seems to have worked			0
snapped into tackles and organised the defence well when they came under late pressure			0
@entity4 defender @entity31 tracks back to challenge @entity5 's @entity21 forward @entity18 @entity47 - 6.5 appeared to have a quiet game but the lack of chances created by @entity5 down his flank was evidence of a decent showing			1
@entity55 - 7 excellent performance - tenacious in the centre of the park and provided the basis for his side 's attacking moves			0
his partnership with @entity65 looks really promising			0
@entity65 - 6.5 strong and assured in central midfield again			0
combined well with @entity55 to consistently force @entity5 out to the wings			2
@entity68 - 7.5 another excellent performance from the @entity70			0
scored the equaliser and combined brilliantly with @entity4 's forwards throughout			1
@entity68 smiles as he watches his shot find the back of the net in the first half @entity77 ( 61 ' @entity78 ) - 6.5 worked really hard defensively against the double threat of @entity28 and @entity7 , never really got a chance to use his pace going forward but provided the assist for @entity0 's goal			1
@entity3 - 8.5 once again proved himself to be @entity4 's most effective forward			2
decent run and shot led to @entity68 's goal and dispossessed a ponderous @entity89 in the build up to the second			1
@entity0 ( @entity92 ) - 7 @entity38 recently revealed he had designed special training exercises for @entity0 to help boost the @entity96 's confidence , they seem to have worked			2
could have done more to prevent @entity7 ' shot for the first goal but more than made up for it with a brilliantly taken chance just before half time			1
manager : @entity38 - 7.5 the @entity103 manager will be delighted with the way his side played but he has to take considerable credit himself			0
@entity4 's midfield dominated the game throughout and his training methods appears to have finally got through to @entity0			1
@entity0 scored his first league goal since march after good work from the excellent @entity3 @entity5 @entity112 - 5 should have done better for @entity4 ' opening goal - his weak save from @entity3 's equally weak shot proved costly as the ball fell into @entity68 's path			1
@entity118 - 6.5 decent going forward and his pace saved @entity5 shortly after the break when @entity121 misjudged the flight of long pass			2
@entity5 's best defender on the night			2
@entity125 was dragged out of position for @entity4 's opening goal and looked exposed in the first half @entity121 - 5.5 had his hands full with @entity3 and @entity0 and did n't always impress , the poor performances of those in front of him left him exposed but some of his decision making was also questionable			1
@entity125 - 5 dragged out of position for @entity4 ' opening goal and looked as though he needed more support from @entity5 's midfielders			1
@entity28 - 6 solid at the back and got forward well in the first half but as the game wore on he found his chances limited			0
@entity144 struggled to get to grips with @entity4 's midfield and almost gave away a late penalty @entity144 - 4 second best against @entity4 's central midfielders for much of the game , struggled to deal with @entity3 and @entity68			1
only settled into the game when the hosts sat back in the second half and could have given way a late penalty			0
@entity89 - 5 like @entity144 , struggled against @entity4 's midfield			2
partially at fault for @entity4 ' second goal after he was dispossessed by @entity3 in the build up			2
this performance demonstrated how important @entity160 is for @entity89			0
@entity161 - 6.5 promising performance for @entity5 fans , some of his first half play was reminiscent of his form last season			2
his influenced waned sightly in the second half but he still looked the most likely source for an @entity5 equaliser			2
@entity161 was @entity5 's best midfielder on the night but could n't help force an equaliser @entity7 ( 61 ' @entity172 ) - 6.5 showed great endeavour to win the free kick that he eventually scored from			1
what a goal it was , too			0
@entity177 ( @entity178 ) - 5 did n't seem quite sure of his role and failed to influence the game in any meaningful way			0
@entity5 fans may wonder why he started ahead of @entity183 against a strong @entity4 midfield			1
@entity18 - 5.5 missed a good chance early in the first half struggled to have any real impact on the match			0
to be fair to the former @entity190 man he was completely isolated for much of the game			0
manager : @entity194 - 6 not an embarrassing performance by any stretch of the imagination but there was far too much sideways passing from the visitors and a number of @entity5 's forwards looked unsure of their roles in the first half			1
referee : @entity205 - 7 both sides had penalty claims turned down , stayed out of the limelight and allowed the game to flow whenever possible			0
@entity7 is congratulated by @entity18 and @entity161 after scoring @entity5 's spectacular opener			1
