on the concourse overlooking @entity1 , a six - metre high bronze statue of @entity3 proudly watched over the 80,000 @entity5 supporters who filed into the national football stadium on saturday			1
when the arena was officially opened in march 2007 , the @entity7 promised us that this magnificent structure was , first and foremost , to be used for football			1
on saturday , as fans made their way past our only @entity17 - winning captain , the ugly truth was confirmed when the lighting rigs were wheeled off the @entity1 pitch			1
the pitch quickly disintegrated under foot during @entity5 's @entity23 qualifying clash at @entity1 @entity1 's pitch was in a poor condition after the @entity27 ' victory over the @entity28 the pitch looked heavy and was cutting up after a day of steady rain as the @entity31 trained the departing circus , in this case the @entity34 , had left their calling card on a playing surface once deemed sacrosanct			1
for a few million bucks , you can trample all over @entity39 and , yes , sod the consequences			0
what a pity for @entity41			0
@entity42 was among the first out , heading over to one half of the pitch to read the words ‘ @entity47 ’ stretching , almost , from the byline to the halfway line			0
behind each goal the emblems of the @entity27 and @entity28 , the two @entity34 teams who threw each other around in the mud last weekend , remained			1
when the @entity7 send @entity57 the pictures of him receiving his golden cap in a glass cabinet from sir @entity61 , the @entity5 centurion will notice the @entity34 regulation 10 - yard lines painted on the playing surface			1
the @entity1 pitch before @entity5 's clash with @entity67 , with non-football markings still clearly visible the @entity34 markings were apparent throughout the pitch at @entity1 during the @entity23 qualifier loose dirt flies flies up at @entity1 as @entity27 ' @entity73 returns the ball against @entity28 so what happens to the @entity1 pitch now ? after next sunday ’s women ’s match between @entity5 and @entity79 , the surface will be ‘ rested ’ ( receive some serious @entity81 ) until the @entity83 final on march 1			1
will the pitch take any more poundings before crucial @entity23 qualifiers ? that would be a big , loud yes			0
two rugby union @entity17 fixtures ( @entity92 v @entity90 and @entity93 v @entity94 ) and an @entity34 match are scheduled in the three weeks leading up to the final home qualifier , against @entity97 on october 9			1
the @entity34 clash between @entity99 and @entity100 is on october 4			2
@entity1 bean - counters would point to the fact that gridiron games sell out instantly , while @entity5 football takes a bit longer			1
how about switching international fixtures away from @entity1 ? sorry , no can do			2
the @entity7 agreed a 10 - year deal to use the stadium and that does not run out until 2017			2
tickets for 10 years were sold on the back of the agreement so @entity41 ’s team will have to lump it for a little longer			0
they were not for the ‘ five - yard furies ’ , as @entity41 has taken to calling his energetic young players , to press the @entity31 in this @entity23 qualifier			0
a week was never going to be enough time for @entity1 ’s ground staff to scrub off the paint and there is n’t a lighting rig in the world that can promote grass growth at warp speed			2
these images , from a venue that is still regarded as the home of football by many visiting players , were beamed around the world on saturday afternoon			0
this is a world - class sporting facility and , if the @entity7 are to put on events with 82,305 congregating at a stadium predominantly built for football , then the team and head coach deserve an elite playing surface			1
the excuse that the wrong topsoil had been used is complete bunkum			0
what it has come down to , as @entity41 reluctantly accepted on saturday evening after his team had beaten @entity67 3 - 1 , is money			0
‘ you ca n’t expect me , as a football coach , to make claims that @entity1 should be used for @entity34 , rugby etcetera , ’ he admitted			1
‘ on the other hand i am pragmatic enough to realise this is a factor in @entity1 life			2
the @entity7 have financial decisions , but as a football person i have to be in the camp that says i would like to see this place lying fallow virtually all the year , apart from seven or eight occasions			1
’ @entity41 will be disappointed with the @entity7 's decision to host rugby and @entity34 matches at @entity1 it will already be on @entity41 ’s radar that next year the pitch will be churned up when two rugby @entity17 group games take place on september 20 and 27			1
on october 4 , the @entity34 circus comes to town again when @entity99 face @entity100			2
the football team , assuming they have n’t been forgotten about by then , play @entity97 in a @entity23 qualifier at the stadium five days later			1
@entity41 will be hopping mad			0
what we have now is a cash cow , a useful vehicle for the @entity7 as they chase the dough before those expensive debentures run out in a few years ’ time			2
until then the @entity5 team , fighting to restore their reputation after a dreadful showing at the @entity17 in @entity181 , will have to make do			0
‘ i can only say that i work for the @entity7 , ’ added @entity41			0
‘ they make the decisions they have to make			0
’ in this case , they have sacrificed the national sport .			0

the @entity7 said @entity1 was going to be used *primarily* for football
however @entity1 hosted @entity34 match days before @entity5 qualifier
@entity1 are scheduled to host rugby and @entity34 games in 2015
