@entity0 are defying @entity1 by telling voters on the doorstep they would not support a post-election deal with the @entity5			1
in an indication of a growing split in the party over its election strategy , several mps are indicating that they would not be prepared to back any arrangement with @entity12 after may			2
some are even said to be threatening to quit the party rather than be part of an administration propped up by the @entity5 , which wants to break up the @entity16			1
labour leader @entity1 is facing a rebellion in @entity18 over his plan to do a post-election deal with the @entity5 despite pressure from shadow chancellor @entity22 , mr @entity1 has repeatedly refused to rule out relying on the votes of @entity5 mps to enable a @entity26 government to take power if he fails to win a @entity29 majority			1
there is rising @entity26 panic at polls suggesting the @entity12 are heading for a landslide victory north of the border – picking up dozens of mps at the expense of @entity26 and the @entity36			1
the latest suggest that the @entity5 could win as many as 50 of @entity18 ’s 59 seats , including @entity26 strongholds currently held by @entity39 and @entity40			1
that would mean @entity42 and @entity43 holding the balance of power at @entity45 , threatening a constitutional crisis			0
one @entity26 mp said : ‘ @entity34 on the doorstep are saying “ if you vote for us we wo n’t do a deal with the @entity5 ”			1
i ’m not aware of a colleague who is advocating against that position			0
’ another mp said : ‘ there ’s no prospect of any deal with the @entity5 and i ’m making that clear on the doorstep			2
‘ but i do n’t want to be focusing on the issue of deals , and i understand why it has n’t been ruled out [ by mr @entity1 ]			2
we would end up getting diverted into a campaign that ’s all about deals , rather than our key message which is that we can have a @entity26 majority government			2
’ in constituencies where there was a strong no vote in last year ’s independence referendum , or where there are large numbers of middle - class @entity18 who traditionally vote @entity36 or @entity74 , @entity26 ’s candidates are now telling people on the doorstep there will be no pact with the @entity5			1
the move – in defiance of mr @entity1 ’s official stance - is designed to encourage tactical voting towards @entity26			1
but in more working - class areas such as the @entity85 where the independence campaign performed better , @entity34 fear ruling out a deal could make voters leaning towards the @entity89 ‘ more bloody - minded ’			2
@entity90 , @entity26 chairman of the @entity91 ruled out a deal with the @entity5 @entity90 , the @entity26 chairman of the @entity91 , is among those who insists any deal with the @entity5 is ‘ simply not credible ’			1
‘ they are simply not trustworthy , ’ he said			0
three other @entity26 candidates told the @entity97 a deal should not be ruled out , but several others have insisted it should be formally rejected			2
one politician said there is strong evidence on the doorsteps that @entity74 and @entity36 supporters are ‘ considering voting @entity26 for the first time to stop the @entity5 ’			1
“ we have to squeeze @entity74 and @entity36 voters and tell them that we wo n’t be dealing with the @entity5 , ” the mp said			2
“ but i do understand why some mps do n’t want us to rule it out			0
people who are thinking of voting @entity5 might see it as belligerent nonsense			0
if the @entity36 were somehow heading for 50 seats , we would n’t be pressed to rule out a deal with them			0
people know there ’s a problem with ruling it out , but there ’ s also a problem if we do n’t			0
’ at last weekend ’s @entity26 conference in @entity121 , mr @entity1 ducked the question haunting his election campaign and failed to rule out a deal with the @entity5			1
he repeated the line that a vote for the @entity5 makes it more likely @entity127 will return to @entity128 , which has so far failed to impress @entity18 voters			0
deputy prime minister @entity130 has upped pressure on the @entity26 leader by ruling his party out of any government involving the @entity5			1
‘ our view is that , in the same way we would not countenance putting @entity138 in charge of the @entity140 , we would not countenance putting the @entity5 in charge of a country that they want to rip apart			0
it ’s as simple as that , ’ the @entity36 leader said			0
that was seen as a rebuke to @entity149 dem business secretary @entity148 , who has mused publicly on the idea of a @entity152 - @entity5 coalition			0
yesterday , @entity26 ’s biggest private donor suggested that working with the @entity74 would be preferable to a deal with the @entity5			1
‘ if you look at what ’s happened in @entity158 and other countries where grand coalitions have happened , they have been reasonably successful , ’ businessman @entity155 said			0
@entity18 ’s first minister @entity42 said : ‘ @entity26 are all over the place			0
the polls show a majority of @entity18 want @entity5 mps providing a strong @entity18 voice in @entity45			0
’ last night former @entity26 welfare minister @entity166 warned the party leadership that a @entity26 - @entity5 deal could lead to a breakaway ‘ @entity170 ’ .			1

@entity1 is facing a rebellion north of the border over @entity5 deal
some @entity34 say they will quit the party over such an arrangement
@entity1 has refused to rule out any post-election deal with the @entity5
one leading @entity26 *member* said any such plan was ' not credible '
