by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 06:53 est , 18 december 2013 @entity3 : 07:57 est , 18 december 2013 all charges against six @entity7 @entity6 activists awaiting trial for protesting in the @entity9 look set to be dropped after the passing of a new law in @entity12			1
the 30 - member crew of the @entity6 ship was detained by @entity12 police during a protest at a floating oil rig in the @entity9			1
six @entity7 members of the group were held in prison for two months until they were finally released on bail to await their trial for hooliganism in @entity25			1
but their charges could now be dropped after @entity12 's parliament today passed an amendment to an amnesty bill			1
the 26 non-russians of the so - called @entity31 could now be free to return home as soon as they are given exit visas by the authorities			0
new law : @entity7 @entity6 activist @entity36 , from @entity37 , pictured in court in @entity25 , may finally be able to return home after a new law could see her charges for hooliganism dropped released : @entity43 , from @entity44 in @entity45 , was arrested by @entity12 authorities during a @entity6 protest in the @entity9 - he was freed on bail after spending two months in detention finally free : @entity50 from @entity51 was the final @entity7 @entity6 activist to be released from jail in @entity12 @entity7 @entity50 , from @entity51 ; @entity43 , from @entity44 in south @entity45 ; freelance journalist @entity53 ; @entity36 , from @entity37 ; @entity54 , from @entity55 , and @entity56 , from @entity57 , may now get to spend @entity58 at home			1
but @entity6 said it was not yet clear when the group will be allowed home , or what will happen to its vessel the @entity64 , which has remained impounded in @entity65 since the arrests			0
@entity67 from @entity68 , one of the activists , said : ' i 'm relieved , but i 'm not celebrating			0
i spent two months in jail for a crime i did n't commit and faced criminal charges that were nothing less than absurd			2
but now at last it seems like this saga could soon be over and it may not be long before we 're back with our families			0
' right now , my thoughts are with our @entity12 colleagues			2
if they accept this amnesty , they will have criminal records in the country where they live , and all for something they did n't do			0
all because we stood up for @entity9 protection			0
' @entity7 @entity6 activist @entity56 pictured at a detention hearing at the @entity92 in @entity25 , @entity12 freelance journalist @entity53 , pictured in court , was one of the six @entity7 held in prison for two months after being arrested by @entity12 police for a protest in the @entity9 impounded : a crew member keeps watch aboard a @entity12 coast guard boat , left , as the @entity6 ship ' @entity64 ' , right , is anchored next to it , in a small bay near @entity102 , after it was seized by @entity12 forces @entity64 captain @entity104 , of the @entity105 , said : ' i might soon be going home to my family , but i should never have been charged and jailed in the first place			1
we sailed north to bear witness to a profound environmental threat but our ship was stormed by masked men wielding knives and guns			0
' now it 's nearly over and we may soon be truly free , but there 's no amnesty for the @entity9			0
' we may soon be home , but the @entity9 remains a fragile global treasure under assault by oil companies and the rising temperatures they 're driving			0
we went there to protest against this madness			0
we were never the criminals here			0
' @entity12 's state duma voted 446 - 0 in favour of the amnesty bill , which mainly concerns first - time offenders , juveniles and women with small children			1
but the amnesty was also extended to suspects of hooliganism who are still awaiting trial , which means the charges against 30 people aboard the @entity6 ship are likely to be dropped			1
freed : @entity6 activist and the captain of the @entity6 ship @entity64 @entity104 of the @entity105 , leaves gates after being released from ' @entity146 prison in @entity25 the 26 non-russian @entity6 activists who had not been able to return home from @entity12 since being arrested the carefully tailored bill , which would also see the release of members of the @entity153 punk band , @entity154 and @entity155 , has been largely perceived as the @entity157 's attempt to soothe the @entity159 's criticism of its human rights record ahead of the @entity161 in @entity162 next year			1
despite the expansion of the bill , it is still drawing criticism because it does not cover former oil tycoon @entity167 , who has been widely described as @entity12 's main political prisoner , and only eight out of 26 defendants who took part in a 2012 protest rally on the @entity172 in @entity173 that ended in scuffles between protesters and riot police			2
opposition lawmaker @entity177 said the amnesty bill ' has buried all hopes of human rights activists and families of political prisoners that their children and family members will be set free '			1
the amnesty could happen as soon as thursday , when the bill is expected to be published in the government newspaper			2
but it allows a six - month period to carry out the amnesty , meaning that some of the prisoners could in theory wait weeks or months before getting released			2
lawyers and families of the @entity153 members insist that everyone eligible for the release ought to be allowed to walk free as soon as the bill is published			2
the two are now slated to be released in march			0
' we 're hoping that in case the bill gets passed , @entity203 and @entity155 will be released on thursday , ' @entity199 , @entity154 's husband , told @entity204			1
' there 's nothing to stop this			0

the @entity220 were detained by @entity12 police in *september*
the six @entity7 were released on bail after two months in prison
they have been awaiting their trial in @entity25
but an amendment to an amnesty bill means charges against suspects of hooliganism who are still awaiting trial should be dropped
it could also see the release of @entity153 band members @entity154 and @entity155
