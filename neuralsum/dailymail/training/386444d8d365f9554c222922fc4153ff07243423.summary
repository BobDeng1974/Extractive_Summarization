by @entity0 with a degree in communications from one of the most prestigious universities in the world , the irony was n't lost on @entity7			1
while packing up his belongings during a house move , his wife noticed a rather unfortunate spelling mistake on his graduation certificate that had been hanging proudly on his wall for years			1
instead of the first vowel in the word ' communications ' being an ' o ' , the document instead had a ' @entity18 ' so that it read ' cummunications '			1
could have done with a spell checker : @entity7 's diploma certificate for his degree in ' communications ' from the @entity23 which actually reads ' cummunications ' because of a rather embarrassing typo shocked : mr @entity7 said his wife noticed the error when she was packing up their belongings while moving house after the certificate had been hanging on the wall for years mr @entity7 earned his mass communications diploma in 2008 from the @entity23 in @entity33 , which counts @entity35 winners among its alumni , so he was completely taken aback by the error			1
speaking of the moment it was spotted , he told @entity40 : ' i just heard this big laugh from the other room			0
' she ( his wife ) actually noticed that there was this typo			0
' when i saw it , it was just shock			0

' prestigious : @entity23 in @entity33 counts @entity35 winners among its alumni his story went viral after he uploaded a picture of his diploma to @entity59			1
mr @entity7 said the university had plenty of opportunities to ensure the certificate was correct after he had been forced to send two earlier copies back because they were wrinkled			2
he admits that he thought the third one ' looked great ' and hung it in his home for years not noticing the mistake			0
but he says wo n't be in a rush to send this one back because it has become so famous			0
