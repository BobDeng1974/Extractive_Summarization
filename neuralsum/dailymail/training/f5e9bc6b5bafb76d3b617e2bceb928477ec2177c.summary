two concept images released earlier this year depicted @entity4 ’s next - generation handset with a slender chassis , as well as a larger 5 - inch screen similar to those seen on the @entity73 and @entity42			2
the first concept predicted the phone will be 4.5mm thick			0

but this is said to be causing production problems *due* to the fragile parts
these claims add to the rumours @entity4 is about to release an @entity121
it would follow the @entity38 , which is 2mm thinner than the @entity38 4
