@entity0 launched its new @entity1 this week , promising to shake up the international calendar and replace pointless friendlies with meaningful competition			1
the inaugural tournament will take place in 2018 and 2019 , helpfully filling the gap between the @entity8 and @entity9			1
but what is the @entity1 and how will it work ? we answer all the key questions for you			2
@entity14 will be one of the 54 @entity0 countries to take part in the @entity1 , to be launched in 2018 how has this @entity1 come about ? @entity0 and its members have long wanted to find a way of spicing up those largely meaningless friendlies that fill the international calendar			1
you only have to look at pictures of a half - empty @entity24 for their september friendly with @entity25 to understand why @entity14 and other countries are in favour of introducing more competitive matches that generate more interest and shift tickets			2
this idea has been on the agenda at @entity0 committee meetings since 2011 and , on thursday , @entity0 finally unveiled the finer details of the new @entity1			1
@entity14 line up to play @entity25 in a september friendly in front of a sparse @entity24 crowd so what 's the format ? the @entity1 will be comprised of four divisions ( @entity41 )			1
each of these is then sub-divided into four groups of either three or four teams ( numbered 1 - 4 )			2
@entity0 's 54 nations will be split between the four divisions , according to their position in the rankings as they stand in november 2017			2
@entity50 will include the top - ranked @entity52 nations , like @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity14 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
@entity57 will contain the minnows like @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
@entity62 and b will consist of four groups of three teams			0
@entity65 will comprise two groups of three teams and two groups of four teams			0
@entity69 will feature four groups of four teams			0
the nations in each group then play each other home and away across the double - header international weeks in september , october and november 2018			1
the format of the @entity1 , which features four divisions sub-divided into four groups each world champions @entity53 will be one of the favourites for the @entity1 when it launches the teams that finish top of the four groups within @entity50 - the top one - then progress to a @entity83 competition to be staged in june 2019			1
they will play in a knockout format with semi-finals and then a final at neutral venues to determine the @entity1 champions			2
there is also promotion and relegation between each of the @entity75 with four teams moving in each direction for the next running of the competition			1
how does this affect @entity99 qualifying ? @entity0 claim the new system will make the @entity9 qualifying more streamlined			1
the qualifying tournament will take place as usual but will take less time , being held between march and november 2019			2
the winners and runners - up from the 10 qualifying groups advance automatically to the finals as is the case now			1
the remaining four places at the finals will come from @entity1 play - offs			1
within each of the four divisions , the four group winners will advance into the play - offs , to be played in march 2020			1
they will then play semi-finals and a final to determine which four nations reach the tournament			0
if the group winners have already booked their place at @entity99 , their place will be allocated to the next best ranked team in their particular division			1
so this is a fall - back for nations who have n't reached @entity99 2020 via the usual qualifying route			2
a graphic showing how the @entity1 fits into the @entity99 qualifying tournament the @entity1 should ensure more exciting matches for @entity14 fans at @entity24 what are the advantages ? the main beneficiaries of the change will be @entity0 's smaller nations			1
those minnows placed in @entity69 will have an equal chance to reach @entity99 2020 because of the play - off system , which is designed so they 're drawn against a nation of similar ability rather than a big gun			1
for the fans , it means a big increase in the amount of competitive football on offer and more attractive fixtures to go and watch			0
wo n't it mean a more crowded calendar ? no , it should n't do			0
the international weeks will remain at roughly the same time of year as they are now			0
@entity0 even say the demands on players will be less because the games will all be in @entity0 , meaning shorter flight times			0
is this the end of friendly matches ? no , there will still be room in the calendar for friendly games against nations from outside of @entity0			1
the new competition offers hope that minnows like @entity61 can qualify for the @entity169 talk me through this then ... ok , let 's take @entity14			0
now as one of @entity0 's foremost nations , they will be drawn in @entity50 with the other top - ranked countries			2
let 's say they 're drawn with @entity178 and @entity179 in one of the three - team groups			0
so between september and november 2018 , @entity14 will play both of them home and away , meaning four matches in total			2
@entity14 beat @entity178 and @entity179 at @entity24 and draw both their away matches , meaning they finish in first place			0
this means they advance to the @entity188 and have a semi-final with , say , @entity53 in june 2019			0
it will be held at a neutral venue determined by @entity0			0
if they win , they 'll make the final , again on neutral territory			0
lose , and they 're out			0
at the same time , @entity14 will be playing through their @entity99 qualifying group as is the case now			1
this will take place between march and november 2019			0
@entity0 president @entity201 has decided @entity99 will be staged right across @entity0 if @entity14 finish first or second , they qualify for @entity99 automatically			2
but say they have a bit of a disaster and only finish third in their group			0
their performance in the @entity1 could save them			0
because they beat @entity178 and @entity179 to finish first , they 'll advance to the play - offs in march 2020			1
there , they will face the next highest - ranked nation who have not already secured their place at @entity99 in a play - off semi-final			1
win that and then the final and they will sneak into @entity99 as one of four teams who have qualified through the @entity1 play - off route .			1
