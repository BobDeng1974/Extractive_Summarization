referee @entity0 clearly does not rate @entity1			1
the @entity3 right back was six yards from goal with just @entity5 to beat when a sliding @entity6 clumsily sent him toppling to the turf			1
simple - penalty , red card			1
the latter , no. for somehow , @entity0 kept his cards in his pocket			2
the whistler 's only explanation can be that he did not deem @entity1 's chance a goalscoring opportunity			1
@entity1 , do not forget , is a defender who has netted three times already this season – he would have scored			1
as it was , @entity19 equalised from the spot – just – when his scuffed 76th - minute effort squirmed under @entity5 to cancel out @entity24 's free - kick			1
@entity3 boss @entity76 certainly felt aggrieved with @entity0			2
' we did not have any luck with the big calls , ' he said			2
' it ( @entity6 foul ) was a penalty and a clear - cut opportunity to score – it was a red card			1
' at that time we had momentum and it could have been very different			2
i was surprised he was not sent off			2
once you give a penalty away it is a red card			1
that was a major moment			2
' @entity76 – who twice signed @entity45 for @entity99 and @entity100 – also thought his former player should have been dismissed			2
' i do n't want to see players sent off but those are the rules , ' he said			0
' @entity45 had a yellow card and he got caught simulating			1
the referee saw it and went to blow the whistle but decided against it			0
the two big calls did not go our way			0
' @entity56 , meanwhile , felt that @entity0 should have shown more conviction			0
' maybe the referee thought it was close , ' he said			0
' sometimes , when a referee does n't know if it 's that close , they go 50 - 50 – give the penalty but do n't send off the player			1
me , i like it to be black or white			0
' but it was tough for the ref. too many little things in isolation made him the most important person on the pitch			0
the best referees in the world are the ones nobody remembers			0
we should n't be talking about him			0
' as it was , @entity27 finished the game with 11 men and could have made it back - to - back victories when @entity60 hacked @entity40 's header from the goal - line in stoppage - time			1
that they could have nicked three points owed much to @entity5 , as well as @entity0			0
@entity27 's @entity24 ( centre ) celebrates after scoring the opener against @entity3 from a free - kick @entity24 's curling effort from a free - kick outside the box found the bottom corner @entity6 dives in for the tackle on @entity3 's @entity1 that conceded the penalty @entity1 is felled by the challenge that led to a long period of deliberation by the officials referee @entity0 consults with his assistant after the incident inside the penalty area @entity6 remonstrates with the assistant but was lucky to not be sent off for the tackle @entity19 ' strike from the spot was unconvincing but effective as he took the @entity3 to 1 - 1 @entity162 miles @entity27 115.6 71.8 @entity24 90 12.4 7.7 @entity38 90 11.6 7.2 @entity42 90 11.5 7.1 @entity3 109.7 68.2 @entity60 90 10.9 6.8 @entity1 90 10.8 6.7 @entity28 90 10.7 6.7 the former @entity164 custodian made his first league start during monday 's 3 - 1 win at @entity167 – where he was only beaten by @entity40 's own goal – and again he impressed			1
early in the second half he twice denied a disappointing @entity67 , first smothering at the @entity171 's feet when he wanted one too many touches in the area and then brushing his top - corner - bound blast onto the angle of the goal			2
those saves allowed the hosts to take an unlikely lead when @entity24 – accepting @entity57 's invitation to locate the bottom corner from 25 yards – duly swept home a delightful free - kick			1
then , the drama unfolded			0
@entity6 escaped red , @entity19 levelled and @entity60 preserved the point with his last - gasp clearance			1
@entity76 , whose side climbed to 10th , reflected : ' we controlled the game with ease for long spells			0
we did not use that control to produce clear - cut opportunities			2
' i was extremely pleased with the reaction and the character			0
' we have shown we have the ingredients of a winning team and that pleases me greatly			0
i do n't think the table reflects the potential we have			0
' @entity27 – beaten 8 - 0 at @entity202 last month – have recovered to scramble from the foot of the table and up to 12th			1
and @entity56 added : ' the idea was to stop the negativity and all the bad things we were doing on the pitch with a few good results			0
' i am a lot happier than where we were one week ago			0
' @entity56 – who confirmed left back @entity214 needs shoulder surgery and will be out until 2015 – will now use the international break to nurse several of his walking wounded back to fitness ahead of their trip to @entity221			0
he is lucky , however , that @entity45 and @entity6 are not suspended			1
@entity3 ' @entity29 defender @entity58 executes a spectacular overhead kick clearance as @entity27 's @entity47 looks on @entity27 's @entity41 is tackled by a sliding @entity63 at the @entity223 on sunday @entity3 's @entity61 screams in pain following a challenge from @entity27 's @entity45 ( left ) , who was booked @entity61 is taken from the pitch on a stretcher not to return for the remainder of the match @entity58 checks on @entity61 as players and officials wait for the stretcher to be brought onto the pitch @entity67 heads with power as @entity3 continue to pepper @entity5 's goal members of the @entity236 march at the @entity223 as part of @entity239 proceedings players observe a minute 's silence on the centre circle on @entity243			1

@entity24 opened the scoring for @entity27 with a curling free - kick from 25 yards in *teh* 67th minute
@entity19 scored a 76th - minute penalty after @entity1 was brought down by @entity6
@entity6 was *fortunate* to stay on the field with @entity1 about to shoot
@entity45 also could have seen red after a dive when on a yellow card for tackle that ended @entity61 's day
the sides were *deadlocked* 0 - 0 at half - time despite the @entity3 having the better of the chances
