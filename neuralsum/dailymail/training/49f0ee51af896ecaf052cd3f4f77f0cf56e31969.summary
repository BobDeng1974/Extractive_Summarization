but this little chap looks like he ’s having a pretty bad day			2
with his paws clenched to his ears he seems to be letting out a yell – not unlike the subject of @entity14 ’s @entity13 painting			1
drama queen : the otter clasps its paws to its cheeks and opens its mouth wide as it floats on its back swirling waters : the sea otter , left , looks surprisingly like the @entity14 artwork @entity13 , right in his own world : photographer @entity26 , 60 , said the otter would have been grooming itself in these sweet pictures the sea otter was photographed as he swam around an @entity31 harbour on his back , just a fish ’s throw away from diners at nearby restaurants			1
@entity26 , 60 , who took the pictures , said : ‘ it is a wild otter but it was not afraid of people who were watching from the dock only a metre or two away			1
' it gathered mussels and was feeding between the boats			0
’ of course , the animal ’s apparent yell of anguish might not be that at all			2
experts suggest otters move their paws over their ears and head as part of a grooming ritual			2

one version sold at auction in may for £ 75million			0
lunchtime @entity14 : mr @entity26 says that when the otter 's hands are near its mouth , it is likely to be feeding mr @entity26 , from @entity63 , added : ' the otter was floating on its back , initially sleeping , and afterwards feeding			0
' the hand movements are feeding - when the hands or paws are in the mouth - and grooming , when the hands are on the ears or other parts of the head			0
' the otter was very close to the dock , so i was able to get sharp , high - quality images			0
' this was a unique opportunity , as most otters in this part of @entity31 are very shy and wary , as they are still hunted and shot as pests			1
' lucky sighting : the wild creature was floating on its back in an @entity31 harbour			1
