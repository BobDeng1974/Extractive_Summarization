a damning report into the horrific neglect of ten children in @entity17 , @entity18 , blamed ‘ wholly dysfunctional ’ management at the council department meant to protect them – led by @entity5			1
police found the children , aged from eight months to 16 years , filthy , starving and covered in lice following a tip - off from a member of the public in april 2009			1
an independent report into the case said the family had been known to @entity17 ’s social services department since july 2002 – seven years before the children were rescued			1
it blamed a ‘ wholly dysfunctional ’ management culture for social workers ’ failure to spot they were being abused			1
the management of the department , it found , was ‘ overbearing ’ , ‘ dysfunctional ’ and ‘ shouty ’			2
the report added : ‘ anxiety bred a culture of harassment and bullying			2
’ it said the management style left staff ‘ demotivated ’ and feeling unable to challenge decisions			2
it also noted there was a high turnover of staff who dealt with the family			2
miss @entity54 , who is not named in the report , was in charge of children ’s services in the borough between april 2005 and december 2008 , most of the time that the family was being monitored			0

the report found that between january 2007 and april 2009 , no social worker , police or health professional saw the children ’s bedrooms			0
after they repeatedly failed to turn up at school , @entity17 ’s @entity85 manager wrote a desperate email to social services in december 2008			0
it read : ‘ how can we rule out neglect if no - one has seen the children ? ’ the reply came back that their case did not ‘ meet the threshold for any kind of strategy meeting ’			1
the report found : ‘ by april 2009 , when the children were taken into police protection , it is the view of the @entity104 that they had been allowed to live in appalling conditions for at least five months too long			0
