by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's first venture into international football was cut short when @entity5 decided to invade			1
understandably , the then coach of @entity7 thought it prudent to leave town			2
but what we are seeing here in @entity13 , without such interruptions , is a demonstration of international management at its finest			1
a style of leadership that is all the more admirable because of the almost intolerable pressure @entity3 and his players are under			1
by his own admission , @entity3 played a part in creating that pressure by declaring some time ago to the @entity24 people – and he has a habit of addressing ‘ the @entity24 people ’ – that his team were going to win this tournament			1
but what else could he realistically say ? he knew very well it was the minimum expectation from the moment @entity13 were awarded this @entity31 by @entity32 back in 2007			1
the way he deals with it in a manner that both protects his players and also appears to have them completely under his spell			0
you only have to see @entity63 humbly referring to him as the ‘ professor ’ , or @entity65 becoming emotional about how ‘ @entity3 ’ supports the players ‘ at this difficult time ’			1
‘ i have to stop talking about him or i may start to cry , ’ was the @entity13 captain ’s closing line at their press conference on the eve of saturday ’s extraordinary win against @entity74			1
it was not something one could ever imagine @entity78 saying when sat alongside @entity79			0
@entity80 might disagree but there is no greater orator than @entity3 at this @entity31			1
he talks about being ‘ three steps from heaven ’			0
he candidly admits to feelings of ‘ anxiety ’ and ‘ loneliness ’			0
and he does n’t discuss @entity13 ’ s chances simply in terms of ambition and potential			1
he speaks of ‘ a promise ’ he has made to 200million fanatical @entity24			1
‘ and if you make a promise you must deliver , ’ he says courageously			0
on the spot : @entity13 fans celebrate after edging past @entity74 in a penalty shoot - out a nation expects : the @entity13 coach has ' promised ' fans that he will bring the @entity31 father figure : @entity3 wants to see poster boy @entity63 lift the @entity31 ... not @entity103 ! @entity104 says it because he knows it is what @entity24 need to hear			1
it ’s like a form of counselling ; comforting words for a nation terrified by the prospect of seeing their team eliminated and so leaving the way clear for @entity117 , for @entity103 rather than @entity63 , to lift the trophy			0
but it serves as a form of counselling for his players as well			0
he knows this @entity13 team does not boast the quality he had at his disposal in @entity127 12 years ago			2
but if he keeps telling his players they can do it , hell they might just succeed			0
he is drawing on all his experience			0
from the 22 jobs in football management , dating back to 1982 , before he took charge of @entity13 for a second time			2
@entity136 brother : @entity3 was brought in to become @entity139 manager in 2008 what went wrong ? the @entity13 boss was sacked after only seven months at @entity142 the @entity139 episode might have damaged him in our eyes , because he did n’t look comfortable towards the end of his seven - month tenure at @entity142			1
he looked shattered by the whole sorry experience , even if he can take comfort in the quality of other managers the trigger - happy @entity152 has dismissed			0
but for the most part he has been successful and never does he seem more in his element than on the international stage			0
he likes the sense of grand occasion , the huge press conferences			0
he enjoys making those presidential addresses to a nation			0
it was something that worked with the @entity162 , when he was guiding them to a @entity165 final and a @entity31 semi-final after that , and it goes down a storm here			2
they admire him for being blessed with unbreakable self - belief			0
‘ i believe firmly in astrology and since i was a kid the stars told me i was a winner , ’ he once said			0
happy homecoming ! @entity3 and @entity174 return after winning the 2002 @entity31 dual nationality : @entity3 took @entity176 to the @entity31 semi-finals in 2006 and such self - confidence makes him fearless in confrontation too			1
for instance he thinks nothing of tearing into someone even as precious to the @entity24 as @entity183			2
‘ i think @entity183 knows nothing about soccer , ’ he once remarked			0
‘ he ’s done nothing as a coach and his analysis turns out to be always wrong			0
if you plan on winning a title , you do the opposite of what @entity183 says			0
’ in @entity3 they appear to admire this as much as they admire the image of @entity104 the aggressor			1
he was managing @entity176 when he thumped @entity199 defender @entity198 but they adore him for the fact that as well as never pulling any punches , he throws the odd one too			2
indeed , when he said it was time to go back to his ‘ aggressive old ways ’ on saturday night , explaining he was too polite when the @entity205 bench turned the technical area into a ‘ war ’ , an audience of predominantly @entity24 journalists lapped it up			2
let 's go to war ! @entity3 has vowed to return to his ' aggressive old ways ' there is more to @entity3 than grand statements , of course			1
he stunned his critics during the build - up to the 2002 @entity31 by employing a three - man defence			1
but it meant he could unleash a three - man forward line of @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 and it worked rather well			1
this time there are echoes of a midfield change , the introduction of @entity224 against @entity74 much like @entity226 ’s selection for the quarter - final against @entity228 in @entity229			1
@entity13 have their stars and they have their leaders			2
before the penalties were taken on saturday @entity63 proved himself to be both , the 22 - year - old more vocal than anyone in that @entity24 huddle			1
sum of parts : @entity3 has managed to create a team , despite not having the greatest players @entity245 nation continue to dance but in that huddle there are players inferior to those under @entity3 ’s command in 2002			1
@entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254			0
from these players @entity3 has still managed to create a team			2
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts , which surely is the very essence of international management and something a succession of @entity228 managers have failed to achieve			0
beyond being a fine tactician , however , @entity3 is @entity13 ’s father figure			1
a natural leader , it is how he has managed from the beginning and perhaps explains why he struggled at @entity139			2
there he found ‘ a group of players running things ’ and it was not to his liking			0
here he runs the show , as he has done from the moment he walked into that first press conference on the eve of the tournament			0
‘ i want to say to the people of @entity13 , our time has arrived , ’ he said			2
right now , with a nation gripped by fear and players petrified of failure , with an exciting @entity289 team coming next , @entity3 is exactly what @entity13 needs .			1

@entity3 is the motivation behind @entity13 's @entity31 bid
@entity3 has ' promised ' @entity13 fans that he will win the @entity31 for them
@entity24 coach led @entity13 to *victory* at the 2002 @entity31 with @entity221
' @entity104 ' was sacked as @entity139 manager after only seven months
@entity3 led @entity176 to the 2006 @entity31 semi-finals
@entity13 face @entity289 in the @entity31 quarter - finals on *friday* 4 july
