famed for phenomenal cuisine , majestic rural landscapes and vibrant cities , @entity0 offers an undisputed sensory overload			2
but there 's one sight the becomes most engrained in the memories of even the most seasoned traveller - the wacky things people carry on the back of a motorbike or scooter			0
@entity16 's seen plenty in his 14 years as an award - winning photojournalist covering the civil war in @entity20 , the revolution in @entity22 , the tsunami in @entity24 and other extensive travels before he co-founded @entity26 , a small group flashpacking tour company			1
but even he repeatedly marvels at what the men and women of southeast @entity29 can balance and transport on just a scooter or a beaten up old motorcycle , and on one of his company 's @entity0 & @entity36 tours with a group of nine this month he was compelled to capture some of the finest			1
there 's seemingly no measure to what can be packed onto the back of a bike or scooter in southeast @entity29 the @entity26 's @entity16 captured this man with scores of live chickens in weaved baskets this month in @entity49 , @entity0 that 's one way to pop a wheelie ! a man pulls a packed trailer from a loading dock at the @entity57 river crossing in @entity0 with a motorbike in this series of images from a single 14 - day trip , he photographs a man casually puffing on a cigarette and carrying what looks like more than 20 live chickens in woven cages perched on the back of his scooter in @entity49 , @entity0			1
at a @entity57 river crossing in @entity0 he is there to watch a motorcyclist dragging a massive trailer out of a boat loading dock on a bike , with the load so heavy he continuously pops wheelies , all the while not in the slightest bit bothered his two wheels have become one			0
@entity16 enjoys the fact that what looks quirky to a @entity83 is simply every day life for the locals			0
in @entity0 alone there are more than 37 million motorbikes or scooters , most definitely the vehicle of choice in traffic that would make western country 's peak hours look tame			0
' unlike other tour companies we venture in to remote parts of @entity49 where it 's not unusual to see bikes carrying livestock like chickens , pigs and goats - it makes really great photographs but it 's just a way of life for the locals , ' said @entity16			1
in @entity110 , the capital of @entity36 , all that 's needed to move some large piles of chairs is two wheels and some clever packing getting around on two wheels is a way of life in @entity0 where there are more than 37 million motorbikes ( and only a few million cars ) ' i watched as one of the bikers tried to work out how he would carry eight goats on his bike , he fell three times before he finally got going and the goats did n't seem to happy about it ! ' a family of five and a smiling group of four adults pile onto scooters to get from a to b while another transport a giant pile of chairs stacked on a tray from one side of the city to the other with the power of just his humble two - wheeler			2
with limited resources comes innovation , as is evident with one mother who has attached a cane high chair to the front of her vehicle to make it more comfortable for her to transport her toddler around town in @entity149 , @entity0			0
' @entity150 and @entity151 are full of bikes and it makes the morning commute in @entity154 seem easy , ' @entity16 said			0
' even though most of our group was very well travelled the amount of bikes on the road still comes as a shock in these amazing countries - it 's crazy ! ' a mother fits a high chair is onto the front of a scooter for her toddler in this shot captured in @entity149 , @entity0 a bike that 's seen better days carrying pigs is not an unusual sight on the road to @entity149 , @entity0 , says @entity16 a family drive is a cosy affair for this five - some packed onto a scooter in @entity150 the man on the back of this scooter in @entity150 , @entity0 , holds a ladder and some building materials as they weave their way through traffic @entity16 says the eight goats in the cage on the back on this bike ' did n't seem happy ' as the rider tipped them over three times the commute in @entity0 makes the daily battle on the tube that @entity194 endure look easy , but they do n't seem to mind the morning commute in @entity149 is certainly less stuffy than piling into the tube on a monday morning and here are some more unique uses for scooters ... an assortment of exotic fish are in bags and ready for sale , cleverly attached to this man 's scooter , in @entity207 , @entity0 a basket vendor balances an array of products on the back of this small motorised bike in @entity149 , @entity0 there 's only one way to transport a bike that is n't working in @entity0 ... on the back of one of the country 's 37 million bikes or scooters			1
