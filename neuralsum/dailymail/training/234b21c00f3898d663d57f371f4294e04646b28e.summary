tortured : @entity0 wants to sue the @entity2 government because , he claims , it helped kidnap him and his wife and deliver them to @entity5 @entity2 courts will hear the case of a @entity9 politician who says the @entity2 government helped kidnap him and his wife and deliver them into the clutches of @entity5			1
@entity0 and @entity14 want a declaration of illegality and compensation over the @entity2 's alleged involvement in their rendition in march 2004 and subsequent torture			1
' my wife and i are gratified by the judges ' decision to give us our day in court , ' said mr @entity0			1
' our part of the " deal in the desert " - the kidnap , the secret @entity33 jail , the torture chamber in @entity35 - is as fresh and as painful for us as if it happened yesterday			2
' the case covers a period from when mr @entity0 and ms @entity14 were detained by @entity39 authorities at @entity41 airport for two days before being deported to @entity42 and held for two weeks			1
they were then flown to @entity44 , ostensibly en route to @entity46 , and later taken to @entity9 on an aircraft said to be owned by a @entity33 front company			1
mr @entity0 says that , in @entity50 , they were detained by @entity52 intelligence and he was tortured while his pregnant wife was chained to a wall			1
when they got to @entity35 , he spent six years in jail and his wife was released shortly before giving birth			0
the @entity59 's decision to allow the case to go ahead reverses a @entity62 ruling that their claim against former foreign secretary @entity64 and sir @entity65 , ex-head of counter-terrorism at @entity67 , should be struck out			1
the master of the @entity69 , lord justice @entity70 and @entity71 said that the proceedings were not barred by state immunity and the act of state doctrine , as government lawyers argued			1
@entity69 said that the allegations were of particularly grave violations of international law and human rights			0
' the respondents in these proceedings are either current or former officers or officials of state in the @entity2 or government departments or agencies , ' the judge said			2
' their conduct , considered in isolation , would not normally be exempt from investigation by the courts			0
on the contrary there is a compelling public interest in the investigation by the @entity96 courts of these allegations			0
' he added : ' unless the @entity96 courts were able to exercise jurisdiction in this case , these very grave allegations would go uninvestigated and the appellants would be left without any legal recourse or remedy			2
' notwithstanding evidence from the @entity109 that there is a risk that damage will be done to the foreign relations and national security interests of the @entity2 , we do not consider that this can outweigh the need for our courts to exercise jurisdiction in this case			0
' here , the risk of displeasing our allies or offending other states , can not justify our declining jurisdiction on grounds of act of state over what is a properly justiciable claim			2
' the judges stayed the claims pending the outcome of an appeal to the @entity131 against their ruling			2
in 2013 , mr @entity0 had offered to drop his case for Â£ 3 , an apology and an admission of liability , but this was rejected			2
in a letter sent to prime minister @entity139 , mr @entity64 , and sir @entity65 , he said : ' i am making an open offer to settle our litigation			0
' my wife and i are willing to end our case against the @entity147 and @entity148 and @entity65 in exchange for a token compensation of a @entity2 pound from each defendant , an apology and an admission of liability for what was done to us			0
' the deal in the desert : former prime minister @entity160 infamously meeting with @entity9 leader colonel @entity5 at his desert base outside @entity162 , south of @entity35 , in 2007 @entity163 from @entity164 , the legal firm which represented the family , said : ' the @entity59 has rightly recognised that the gravity of the allegations raised by our clients makes it all the more compelling for the @entity96 courts to get on and deal with their case and to reject outright the attempts by @entity64 , @entity65 and the government defendants to shield their conduct from judicial scrutiny			1
' our clients are now a significant step closer to seeing justice done in their case			0
' @entity180 , a director at @entity181 , which also represents the family , said : ' the government so fears this case going to trial that they have stalled for years by throwing up a parade of scarecrows - claiming , for example , that the @entity52 would be angered if @entity0 and mrs @entity189 had their day in @entity62 in @entity2			1
' @entity191 was right : embarrassment is no reason to throw torture victims out of court			0
the government 's dubious and wasteful delay tactics in this case need to end			2
' accused : sir @entity65 , former counter-terrorism chief at @entity67 , and @entity64 , the former foreign secretary under @entity160 , are both named in the lawsuit brought by mr @entity0 and his wife @entity204 , director of justice which intervened in the case together with @entity207 , @entity208 , and @entity209 , said : ' the government 's case would fundamentally undercut the international rule of law and undermine the global commitment to remedies for victims of human rights violations			1
' the ' they did it too ' defence traditionally has n't worked in the playground			0
yet , the @entity147 would - in expanding the ' act of state ' doctrine and the scope of state immunity - seek to enshrine it in common law			1
' ' we welcome the decision of the @entity59			0
states can not be encouraged to supplement the international law of state immunity with their own pick and mix patchwork of domestic rules on justiciability			1
' @entity207 @entity2 director @entity237 said : ' it 's only right that @entity2 officials - right to the very top if necessary - are answerable for actions that may have led to terrible mistreatment at the hands of @entity5 's henchmen in @entity9			1
' the @entity2 has been trying to place itself above the law - a shocking response to a very serious case			0
' @entity2 officials have got their paw prints all over this case and it 's far too late for them to pretend otherwise			0
' the @entity2 should now stop blocking attempts to discover the full truth about the involvement of @entity2 officials in this sordid and deeply troubling affair			0

@entity0 and his wife say they were kidnapped by @entity67 and @entity33
they claim they were delivered to @entity9 and then tortured by @entity5 's men
government had tried to claim ' state immunity ' over the allegations
@entity131 will make final decision on whether the case can be heard
