a week after their big fallout in @entity3 , @entity0 teamed up with @entity4 to help put him within sight of fulfilling his @entity7 dream			1
the two of them reformed their irregular doubles partnership to defeat @entity12 ’s @entity11 and @entity13 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 and give @entity14 what should prove a decisive 2 - 1 lead in the final			1
@entity4 will be the first match off against @entity19 in the reverse singles on sunday , and if he can win he would seal a first @entity7 trophy both for his country and himself , placing his name on the one piece of tennis silverware that lacks it			1
the two @entity14 , involved in an unseemly spat at the @entity49 in the @entity50 after @entity0 rowed with his compatriot ’s wife @entity51 , have managed to unite in common cause this week			2
@entity4 was named for the doubles an hour before the match , having had no adverse reaction in his back to his heavy beating by @entity59 on friday , his worst ever in this competition			0
having looked somewhat immobile at times in that match , he settled comfortably into the less demanding doubles environment and brought his unique set of skills to bear			0
he and @entity0 had lost their last four @entity7 doubles rubbers , belying the fact they won the @entity69 together in 2008			2
however , the @entity14 had little choice but to pair them with little strength in depth			0
the @entity14 pair of @entity4 and @entity0 teamed up to devastating effect securing a 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 victory there was a fantastic atmosphere in @entity79 for the the third match of the @entity7 tie @entity13 and @entity11 were no match for @entity4 and @entity0 on saturday the @entity12 have more options , but @entity19 was reported to have asked to sit the match out , so they went with experienced doubles specialist @entity13 and the talented but sometimes brittle @entity11			1
with @entity51 again absent the @entity14 broke @entity13 in an otherwise tight first set before another feverish crowd in excess of 27,000 inside the @entity89 @entity88			0
it was hard to believe its usual football audience provides the same noise levels			0
in the second set the @entity12 forced five break points but @entity11 , returning from the advantage court , could not convert any of them			2
they paid for it when @entity4 broke for 6 - 5 with a glorious backhand return			0
@entity4 and @entity0 in perfect symmetry during the third rubber of the @entity7 showdown in @entity79 with @entity11 , a sporadic doubles player at best , looking increasingly wobbly the superior big match experience of the @entity14 was proving a major factor			1
it was @entity4 who broke decisively at 2 - 2 when , with the @entity12 crowd now becalmed , he fired a forehand winner right down the middle of the court			1
@entity0 intervened decisively at the net as @entity4 served out the match with a minimum of drama			0
the world no 2 will be desperate to finish the job himself , and providing his back continues to improve , @entity19 did little against @entity0 to suggest he will be able to stop him .			2

@entity4 and @entity0 teamed up just one week after @entity37 spat
they saw off the @entity12 pairing of @entity11 and @entity13 in *straight* sets
@entity14 now hold a 2 - 1 advantage over @entity12 with two rubbers left
@entity4 will seal first @entity7 trophy if he beats @entity19
