by @entity0 published : 10:26 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 11:18 est , 11 october 2013 conman : @entity2 stole £ 3,000 from a pensioner claiming he knew of a miracle fix for intolerable condition , tinnitus a conman preyed on a vulnerable pensioner stealing £ 3,000 by spinning the lie that he knew a miracle fix for an incurable medical condition			1
@entity12 discovered his 73 - year - old victim suffered from tinnitus - a persistent and debilitating ringing in the ears - during a chance meeting on a bus in @entity19			1
the conniving 53 - year - old convinced his victim he knew of a clinic that could cure the intolerable condition			1
days later @entity2 claimed to have arranged an appointment at a centre in @entity24 , making sure his elderly victim was present when he posted a £ 3,000 cheque on the pensioner 's behalf - ' secure ' the alternative treatment			1
he then persuaded his victim to pay the £ 3,000 back in cash , escorting the pensioner to the building society to ensure he got his hands on the money			2
@entity2 made the scam appear more believable by telling the tinnitus sufferer he had previously been cured by the clinic			1
in addition he gave him a £ 3,000 cheque as ' compensation ' in case things went wrong			0
but when @entity2 backed out of his offer to give the pensioner a lift to his appointment , concerns grew and the unsuspecting victim discovered the promise of a cure had been a cruel con , and that the clinic never actually existed			1
the £ 3,000 compensation cheque bounced when the pensioner tried to cash it , in a bid to get his money back			0
prosecutor @entity57 told @entity58 : ' it was totally disgraceful conduct , targeting a vulnerable man			0
' there is no cure but the clinic , he said , offered alternative treatment , the victim no doubt having been told by his doctor it was an incurable condition one learns to live with			2
' he is a confidence trickster , the offending against a 73 - year - old man was particularly sophisticated			1
@entity2 , from @entity19 , was handed a suspended prison sentence after recorder @entity71 said he hoped the fraudster , who is setting up a landscaping business , would repay the money ' the clinic , despite efforts by the police to locate it , does not exist			1
' the court heard the case had previously been adjourned after @entity2 promised to repay the money back to his victim			1
but mr @entity57 said : ' not a penny has been forthcoming			0
' the cruel con took place just weeks after @entity2 cost a hire company more than £ 4,000 by failing to return a petrol lawn mower , mini-digger , strimmer and concrete breaker he had leased			2
the machinery was never recovered after @entity2 claimed they had ' been lost '			2
@entity2 , of @entity95 , @entity19 , was sentenced to six months imprisonment , suspended for two years , and ordered to pay the victim ’s £ 3,000 back to him within the next 12 months			1
he had admitted theft and fraud charges			0
mr @entity100 said : ' this offence was a particularly unpleasant and a particularly mean offence , targeting this man in this way			0
' it was a quite determined effort , you pursuing him , going to his home and getting the money in that way			0
' the judge said the sentence could be suspended ' with a good deal of hesitation ' to allow @entity2 , who claims to be setting up a landscaping business , to pay the money back			2
he told @entity12 : ' you are extremely fortunate to be leaving the court today			0
' @entity117 , defending , said ' disgraceful ' was an appropriate word for the offence , which he had not pre-planned , and said @entity2 is a former business owner who is hoping to start afresh			0
mr @entity117 said : ' he had never met the victim , there was nothing more than a chance encounter , an opportunity the defendant seized and pursued , with some determination , i accept			0
