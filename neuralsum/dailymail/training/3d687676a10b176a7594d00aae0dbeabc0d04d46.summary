by @entity0 brave : @entity2 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , was just two years old when she had her right foot amputated and all the toes on her left removed a girl has won a ' £ 1million payout ' after she had amputations on both feet because a nurse failed to realise she was suffering from meningitis - and instead , prescribed her @entity14			1
@entity2 , from @entity3 , @entity15 , @entity4 , was just two years old when her mother @entity16 , 33 , rang the out - of - hours medical phone line for advice			1
she told a duty nurse her daughter was lethargic , short of breath , wobbly and vomiting - and was advised to give the toddler @entity14 and call back if she was still concerned			1
but @entity2 , now 11 , deteriorated rapidly - and by the time she got to hospital , the bacterial blood infection septicaemia had taken hold			1
days later , surgeons were forced to amputate her right foot and all of the toes on her left			1
today , @entity2 was awarded compensation after a high court judge ruled the nurse had been negligent in failing to arrange her immediate admission to hospital			1
judge @entity34 told @entity36 's @entity35 that the company that ran the out - of - hours service , @entity39 , was liable for the medic 's blunder			1
he added that if the schoolgirl had been treated earlier , her foot and toes would probably have been saved			2
although the amount of @entity2 's compensation has yet to be confirmed , her lawyers have valued her claim at about £ 1million			1
acting on behalf of the family , @entity49 previously told the court that ms @entity16 had called the @entity53 line operated by @entity54 in the early hours of november 1 , 2004			1
battle : @entity2 's mother @entity16 ( left ) , 33 , rang the out - of - hours medical phone line for advice after her daughter became lethargic , short of breath and wobbly			1
she was told by a duty nurse to give the toddler @entity14 private company : @entity54 ( pictured ) in @entity63 runs the @entity53 's out - of - hours helpline she said the concerned mother had told the nurse that @entity2 was ' wobbly , vomiting and just not right ' , and had also been ' burning up '			1
miss @entity49 claimed the medic should have arranged for an emergency ambulance to be called - but instead , she prescribed @entity14 , an over-the - counter paracetamol syrup			2
during the night , @entity2 ' kept waking up ' and her mother called an ambulance in the morning after she noticed blemishes on her legs , the court heard			2
recovering : but @entity2 ( pictured with her mother in 2005 ) deteriorated rapidly - and by the time she got to hospital , the bacterial blood infection septicaemia had taken hold			1
surgeons had to amputate her foot and toes happy again : today , @entity2 was awarded compensation after a high court judge ruled the nurse had been negiligent in failing to range her immediate admission to hospital			1
above , @entity2 is pictured aged two the toddler was then diagnosed with meningococcal septicaemia - and spent eight days on life support in intensive care , where her hands and feet turned black			2
however , she pulled through after surgeons removed her foot and toes			2
speaking at the time , ms @entity16 said : ' she came down with a temperature and was feeling a bit drowsy - i thought it was the flu			1
success : although the amount of @entity2 's compensation has yet to be confirmed , her lawyers have valued her claim at about £ 1million			1
above , @entity2 in 2008 ' i called the emergency doctor and he said to leave her until the morning			2
next day , i noticed she had a few spots			0
' it took a couple of minutes for the ambulance to get here			0
i was shaking , but they took over			0
i did n't want to watch			0
i had to leave the bedside because it was touch and go			0
' i did n't know anything about septicaemia			0
it was n't until they put her on a life support machine that they told us			0
' they told me if i had waited for an emergency doctor to come , she would have died			0
' the first 48 hours were the most critical , whether she would pull through or not			0
it was just a matter of hoping she would			0
' her feet were really black and her hands were too			0
you could tell they were actually gone			0
her hands were saved by all the stuff she was on - the nine machines around her			0
' in a two - hour operation on december 6 , surgeons removed @entity2 's right foot and five toes from her left			1
her family remained at her bedside until she was allowed home on december 22			0
@entity2 now has a false leg			0
judge @entity34 said that , had the nurse correctly noted @entity2 's symptoms , @entity39 's computer system would have prompted her to call for an ambulance straight away			2
he added that had @entity2 been admitted to hospital by about 1am that night - rather than more than 10 hours later - she would swiftly have been given antibiotics , and the double amputation would probably not have been necessary			2
@entity39 admitted the nurse had been negligent in failing to arrange for a doctor to call at the family home			0
but the firm disputes claims the medic should have called for an ambulance immediately - saying that if she had , it would have made no difference to the outcome			0
the amount of @entity2 's compensation will be calculated at a further court hearing , unless final settlement terms are reached before then .			2
