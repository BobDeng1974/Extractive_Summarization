and yesterday , the former education secretary ’s @entity5 puppy proved just how useful he could be - coming runner - up in the annual @entity9 competition			0

asked what lessons he had applied from dog ownership to his current role as chief whip , he told the @entity41 : ‘ i think it ’s vitally important to recognise the critical necessity of hugging people close at certain times and then at other times rubbing people ’s noses in it			1
’ victorious mr @entity15 said he was ' thrilled ' for @entity18 , adding : ' i am very proud that he has been part of an event that promotes responsible dog ownership			2

inside the chamber , @entity16 mp @entity92 had been sparring with @entity28 frontbencher @entity94 about whether or not mr @entity0 was ‘ gainfully employed ’ in his current role			1
mr @entity92 said : ‘ i understand the government chief whip and his dog @entity10 have just come runners - up in the @entity100 competition so i withdraw the implication he has n’t got much to do with his time			1

@entity85 , chief executive of the @entity85 , said : ' the @entity9 competition is so much more than a canine beauty pageant			0
