@entity0 has questioned why there has been limited reaction from the current @entity4 set - up in the wake of @entity7 's controversial claims in his autobiography			1
@entity7 's book , released last week , sent shockwaves through the cricket world , with the 34 - year - old criticising an alleged ' bullying ' culture led by the bowlers within the @entity4 dressing room			1
while several former professionals have commented on the allegations , - including former spinner @entity18 , who , @entity7 claims , was among the ringleaders - only @entity4 captain @entity20 and seamer @entity21 among the current number have spoken out in defence of the team			1
' i believe @entity20 and others should get on the front foot a bit more , ' he said in an interview with the @entity42			0
' when you and your system are challenged you need to fight back , this sentiment is always expressed in team meetings , never take a backward step have the courage of your convictions			2
stand up and stand tall for your country			0
@entity7 poses with his new autobiography during a book signing in @entity53 last week ' the players may have been told to maintain silence but if i was still part of that dressing room i would want to have my say irrespective of any media strategy from the suits			1
' @entity0 has become the latest person to question @entity7 's version of events and launched a staunch defence of former coach @entity65 , who was described by @entity7 as ' sour ' and ' dour '			1
' i call @entity4 's anchor , ' said @entity0			1
' as head coach he created a calm and committed atmosphere in the @entity4 dressing room			2
' he had great determination to prepare for every format of the game			0
he always looked to promote attacking ideas to win matches			0
he brought a new belief to players following a period of turmoil - at least that 's what i noticed during my involvement as batting coach			1

there are always disagreements within teams and things said in the heat of the moment			0
but the way it has been portrayed is not my recollection of the atmosphere within the team			0
' @entity7 was also scathing of @entity100 , with an entire chapter dedicated to the wicketkeeper - batsman			2
but @entity0 added : ' @entity100 is nothing but a team man and nothing but positive			2
i considered him the glue of the side and a brilliant batsman who could adapt his game to suit any situation			0
' he was also a world - class wicketkeeper , one of several world - class players we 've had over the past few years ' @entity114 calls @entity26 report ' an embarrassment '			0
