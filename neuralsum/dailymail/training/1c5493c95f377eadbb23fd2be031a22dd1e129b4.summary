@entity1 ’s loan spell at @entity2 took a turn for the worst on thursday night after he was booed by his own supporters			1
the @entity6 striker , who signed for the @entity7 after an encouraging @entity8 for @entity9 in the summer , missed a penalty in the @entity11 in a 3 - 0 defeat against @entity13			1
costing @entity15 £ 10million , @entity14 ’s year back at @entity2 was seen as a chance to hone consistency in front of goal			2
on - loan striker @entity1 had a @entity11 night to forget against @entity13 after he missed a penalty it is 923 minutes since the striker has scored and the fans showed their anger as they booed him off the pitch the 19 - year - old is on loan from @entity6 for the rest of this season following his £ 10million summer move but the teenager has now gone a staggering 923 minutes without finding the net – his last goal coming against @entity13 at the beginning of october			1
games : 19 goals : 4 games since his last goal : 10 and enough was enough for @entity40 fans , who heckled @entity14 ’s every touch after his penalty was saved by @entity44			2
they are worrying signs for @entity15 , whose own front men have spectacularly failed so far this season			2
without @entity49 – sold to @entity50 – and missing the injured @entity51 , @entity6 have scored just 19 goals in the @entity53			1
@entity6 striker @entity49 celebrates scoring against @entity54 during the 3 - 2 win in the @entity53 @entity51 has not played for @entity6 since august and will remain out until next year due to a thigh injury @entity51 scores for @entity6 during their 2 - 1 victory over @entity58 on the first day of the season @entity60 has failed to live up to expectations since arriving at @entity62 for £ 16m this summer by this stage last season @entity49 had 15 @entity11 goals			1
so far this term , it 's a totally different story for @entity6 front men ... @entity60 – two goals in 14 games @entity71 – two goals in 18 games @entity51 – one goal in three games in all competitions , it ’s been 442 minutes since a @entity6 striker last scored for them ( @entity6 ) last season 's second top goalscorer @entity51 has been sidelined for a number of months after suffering an injury whilst on @entity84 duty in early september			1
since then he has not played a single minute for @entity6 , having been hit with another injury ( thigh ) that will keep him out until the @entity88			2
the 25 - year - old formed a formidable partnership with @entity49 , scoring 21 @entity53 goals for the @entity7 last term			0
@entity51 has featured for @entity15 ' side just three times in the @entity11 this season , scoring once against @entity58 on the opening day			0
his replacements have not been much more prolific either			0
controversial £ 16million summer signing @entity60 has netted only twice in 14 shows for the @entity101 club			0
manager @entity15 has backed his decision to take a gamble on 24 - year - old striker @entity60 in addition , the former @entity106 striker regularly attracts the spotlight for his behaviour off the pitch , as well as on it			0
with former @entity112 manager @entity111 saying on thursday that the 24 - year - old is wasting his career , he will be hoping to improve on his poor start to life in @entity6 as he returns from a groin injury to face @entity118 on sunday			1
also on the list of misfiring forwards at the @entity62 club is @entity71 , who joined his hometown club in the summer			0
dream move it may have been , but the former @entity58 man has an even worse record in front of goal than that of fellow strike partner @entity60 - just two in 18 games			0
to make matters worse , manager @entity15 hauled him off at half time as @entity6 were eliminated form the @entity132 after their 1 - 1 draw with @entity134			1
@entity71 ( centre left ) looks dejected after conceding a goal in tuesday 's @entity132 draw			0

@entity1 is *spending* this season on loan following move to @entity6
@entity2 striker was booed off after missing a spot - kick against @entity13
the @entity40 side have failed to win in all competitions since september
