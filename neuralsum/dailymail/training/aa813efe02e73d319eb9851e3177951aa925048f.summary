@entity0 credited his wife @entity1 for backing him at his lowest ebb earlier this summer as @entity3 celebrated a triumphant 3 - 1 win over @entity5			1
the @entity3 captain had been considering his future in june as his side faced defeat by @entity10 , but he was all smiles after a feeble @entity5 were trounced by an innings and 244 at @entity13			1
asked to name the most important factor in his decision to stick with the job , @entity0 said : ‘ the support of my wife			2
you can bare your soul quite often to @entity22 , and she ’s very good at getting me back on the straight and narrow			0
’ both @entity0 and man of the series @entity32 — who finished only three wickets short of @entity35 ’s @entity3 - record 383 test victims — claimed the dressing - room had been helped by @entity5 ’s insistence on trying to get @entity32 banned following his altercation with @entity39 at @entity40			1
' it 's right up there ... it 's the best i 've probably bowled , yeah , ' @entity32 said of his own form			2
happier times : @entity0 had been considering his @entity3 future in june parading the trophy : @entity0 holds the series trophy after @entity3 won the 5th @entity49 against @entity5 @entity50 and @entity51 reach record heights he continued on @entity53 : ' the way the whole group has bowled has been outstanding since @entity56			1
' we 've got on top of their batsmen and not let them get back in any of the games we 've played			0
we 've created pressure non-stop			0
' that 's a credit to all - not just the four seamers , but @entity67 as well			2
' on what had changed since the loss at @entity71 , he said : ' we decided to concentrate not on plans for particular batsmen , but on what we do well - hitting the top as much as we could , challenge their outside edge , challenging their forward defence			0
and i think as we 've gone on through last three tests we 've improved on that in each game			0
