we all noticed @entity2 's assets making a guest appearance when she strode onto the red carpet wearing no bra beneath her black dress at the @entity7 on tuesday			1
but rather than being an anomaly , such public ditching of one 's support act has become a recent trend among tars including @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
and while we 've all heard horror stories of what will happen if we plump for bralessness - breasts that swing down below our knees , back pain that could land us in hospital - new research suggests that wearing a bra could actually contribute to these problems			1
researchers at the @entity35 found that not wearing a bra increases the strength of the breast muscles , which results in them sagging less over time			1
professor @entity39 , who led the study , said he believed the ' absence of a bra could keep breasts in shape ' and prevent back ache			1
he explained : ' the decision not to a wear a bra appeals to women in terms of comfort and aesthetics			2
contrary to popular belief , the breast does not fall , but tightens and lifts , and the quality of the skin improves			0
’ ' professor @entity39 said 42 per cent of the women ' felt discomfort ' for the first three months of not wearing a bra , but then it disappeared			2
none were in pain , however , nor were they hampered from doing daily activities , including sport			0
but do n't set your bra alight just yet			0
despite his findings , professor @entity39 said women should not get rid of their bras			0
his study only involved a small number of women , and the long - term effects of not wearing a bra are unknown			2
@entity14 ditched her supporting act for @entity75 last year indeed , previous research has shown that women who do not wear a sports bra while exercising could be damaging their breasts			1
the ligaments which support the breasts are not elastic , and can be irreversibly stretched when the breasts bounce during repetitive or high impact sports			0
( luckily , high - energy activity at award ceremonies is kept to a minimum , so celebrities remain safe when they go braless for the red carpet			0
) and aside from health effects , a lack of support can do damage to your career : research carried out by the @entity96 discovered that those who go braless at work are less likely to be promoted to high executive levels			2
( unless , of course , said role is as a presenter on @entity103			0

celebrities including @entity15 and @entity16 have gone braless
@entity33 research suggests bras could do breasts more harm than good
not wearing bra could maintain shape , and prevent sagging and back ache
but women going braless are less likely to be promoted in workplace
