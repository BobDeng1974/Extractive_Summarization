by @entity0 published : 05:35 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 17:59 est , 30 august 2013 ' genius ' : poet and writer @entity4 has died aged 74 in @entity5 , it emerged today his fans adored him , especially women			1
the most devoted , who followed him round the circuit of literary festivals , were dubbed the ‘ @entity11 ’			1
and with his majestic voice , and the twinkle in his slanting eyes – one friend joked that he looked like a drunken @entity16 – @entity4 was a man who exuded kindness and warmth			1
but the @entity20 - winning poet , who died yesterday aged 74 after a short illness , had a tougher side too			1
he fought harder than anyone to reverse the decline in how we speak and write @entity26			1
in an era of text - speak and @entity28 , when schools were busily scrapping rules on grammar , spelling and vocabulary , @entity4 taught people to love @entity26 by encouraging them to learn its poetry by heart			1
with @entity38 , the future poet laureate , he compiled a glorious collection , @entity40 , which since it appeared in 1982 has become the best - loved schoolbook in @entity42			1
his ambition was to collect a panorama of poems that could easily be committed to memory into a single volume			1
he and @entity38 had an infallible instinct for lines that , once read , would never be forgotten			1
when education secretary @entity51 was widely criticised for saying children should learn poetry by rote , @entity50 leapt to his defence			1
‘ i believe in people learning poetry by heart – definitely , ’ @entity4 said			1
‘ most poets have chunks of poetry memorised			1
at 12 he won a scholarship to @entity88 , a @entity84 boarding school , where budding politician @entity89 was also a pupil			1
both men would go on to win a @entity20 ; @entity4 got his for literature in 1995			1
while at @entity93 ’s , tragedy struck when @entity4 ’s younger brother , @entity0 , was knocked down by a car and killed			1
ten years later , in a 1966 collection of his poems , @entity103 , @entity4 remembered seeing the four - year - old boy ’s little body in its coffin : ‘ wearing a poppy bruise on the left temple / he lay in the four foot box as in a cot ... a four foot box , a foot for every year			1
’ the image is stark and the language is simple			2
@entity4 prided himself on plain poetry that was never pretentious			2
that did n’t always impress his contemporaries , who were writing wild streams of consciousness and hallucinatory blank verse			2
@entity4 was ‘ far from unfathomable , ’ said one critic tartly , as if being unfathomable were a virtue			2
but @entity4 ignored the critics , continuing to write in his own clear , rational style			2
‘ in the @entity121 , seventies and @entity123 , ’ he admitted , ‘ there was a notion that order and discipline meant you were a dictator in the making and certainly you were supporting [ the war in ] @entity131			2
’ in fact , said @entity4 , ‘ formal verse is easier			2
’ much loved : @entity4 's work made him world famous but it was his sense of humour that also won him a great deal of affection he believed in the power of poetry to change the world			2
‘ when there ’s a crisis like 9/11 , a bomb or something like that , there is a wish for a language that will help , not comprehension but acceptance or standing up to it			2
’ though @entity4 fiercely loved the @entity26 language and its history , he did n’t take kindly to being called an @entity154			2
he refused the offer to become poet laureate after @entity38 died , and responded in furious verse when his work was included in an anthology of @entity42 poets			1
‘ be advised , my passport ’s green / no glass of ours was ever raised / to toast the @entity166 , ’ he warned , before signing off , ‘ @entity42 , no , the name ’s not right			2
/ yours truly , @entity4			0
’ he wrote elegies for friends killed in the @entity169 but refused to condone the violence , and kept his distance from politics			0
life : @entity4 was born in april 1939 , the eldest of nine children , and went on to forge a fantastic writing career , pictured right reading a poem at an event in june meeting : @entity4 is introduced to the @entity166 by @entity69 president @entity179 during @entity181 's historic visit to @entity83 in 2011 ' between my finger and my thumb , the squat pen rests ; snug as a gun ' - from his poem digging			0
' wearing a poppy bruise on the left temple , he lay in the four foot box as in a cot			0
no gaudy scars , the bumper knocked him clear			0
a four foot box , a foot for every year ' - from his poem @entity103			0
' when history says , do n't hope , on this side of the grave			0
but then , once in a lifetime the longed - for tidal wave of justice can rise up , and hope and history rhyme ' - from the play @entity204 and quoted by then @entity76 president @entity75 in a speech about the @entity83 peace process delivered in @entity86 in 1995			1
' it 's like being a little foothill at the bottom of a mountain range , you hope you just live up to it ' - @entity4 on receiving the @entity20 and being regarded as the equal of @entity213 ' it was like opening the back door of our own house , looking out on the fields ' - @entity50 on the influence of reading his fellow poet , @entity220			1
' the life of poetry at its most vital is a life of fear i think and panic that it will leave ' - @entity50 describing his worry that his poetic inspiration might run out			0
he once said he had ‘ an early warning system telling me to get back inside my own head ’ whenever politics was discussed			0
though he left the countryside and taught @entity26 first in @entity232 and then in @entity5 as a young man , he did not forget his farming roots			1
he fondly remembered watching his grandfather cutting turf for peat , and taking a bottle of milk to the old man who would straighten up just long enough to drink it before bending over his spade again			0
he pictured himself working in the same way , digging out words with the nib of his pen			0
unfortunately for his besotted female fans , he was – almost uniquely among poets – a happily married family man			0
he had two sons and a daughter with his wife @entity65			0
he and @entity65 met in 1962 , and they fell in love during evenings spent with @entity38 and his then lover @entity255 , drinking ‘ poteen ’ – home - brewed potato whiskey – and reciting poems , while @entity65 sang folk songs			0
unlike many literary men , @entity4 did not enjoy feuds			0
he was amiable and quick to give praise , which won him friends			0
even the notoriously grumpy @entity38 was happy to work with him			0
when @entity38 died , @entity4 gave the eulogy at @entity266 and said that no death outside his own family had grieved him so deeply			1
but there was one notable enmity			0
@entity4 disliked the downbeat poetry of @entity272			0
a poet ’s job , said @entity4 , was to lift up a lyre , or harp , and play music to the gods			1
@entity272 ’s work , he implied , was more like someone drumming on a kitchen sink			0
he continued to win over fans until the end of his life			0
at one recent reading , a young student was heard lamenting , ‘ i love @entity4 ! i just want him to give me a hug ! ’ with his passion for poetry and his genius for selecting verses we all could learn easily by heart , @entity4 gave us much more than the promise of a hug			0
he restored our love of the @entity26 language .			0

@entity302 writer had suffered ill health for some time and has died in @entity5
@entity306 in 1995 ' for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth '
@entity75 describes the late poet as ' a powerful voice for peace '
