by @entity0 this is the moment one of the bravest animals in @entity4 showed why it has so much respect - as it battled a whole pride of lions			1
the plucky honey badger was caught out in the open in the @entity12 , @entity13 , and unluckily became the target for a group of lions			1
stranded and weighing just 20lbs the badger decided to fight back against at least four young lions each 15 times its size			1
surrounded : a pride of young lions circle the honey badger which , rather than running in the opposite direction , chooses to stand and confront its giant predators out in the open at the @entity12 the honey badger 's tough hide and surprising strength and ferocity made it a tricky customer for the lions who struggled to deliver the killer bite			1
incredibly the pint - sized battler managed to resist the massive predators ' attack for more than 30 minutes			1
wildlife photographer @entity37 watched as the badger kept the lions at bay and eventually had to leave the scene still seeing the badger fighting back			0
he said : ' a scene like this is extremely rare to witness , the lions - all young lions by the way - tried their best to kill the young honey badger			2
' it was probably their first time to try out their hunting skills on this animal and try as they might , they could not deliver a killer blow			0
refusing to go down quietly , the honey badger does its best to evade the grip of an attacking lion last stand : one of the lions eventually manages to clamp its jaws around the tiny frame of the honey badger			0
but because of its tough hide the animal continues to put up a fight ' the honey badgers skin is so though that the ions could not suffocate it or pull it apart - something lions certainly do n't struggle with other less tenacious victims			0
' half an hour passed with the lions biting , chewing , clawing at the badger - but still the young honey badger just kept growling and fighting			2
' we left the scene with the lions still passing around the badger between them - none of them knowing what to do to kill the animal			0
' honey badgers are found all over @entity4 and @entity86 and are known for their intelligence and ferocious attitude even when confronted by animals much bigger than them - with documented fights with lions , hyenas and even rhinos			0
against all odds : the brave honey badger does its best to wriggle free from the lion 's grip in a fight lasting more than 30 minutes honey badgers are found all over @entity4 and @entity86 and are known for their intelligence and ferocious attitude even to animals much bigger than them - with documented fights with lions , hyenas and even rhinos it is a mustelid and bears some similar characteristics to both a badger and the much smaller weasel			1
in popular culture throughout @entity4 , the animal - also known as a @entity110 - is known for its fighting nature and the @entity114 military have a vehicle named after it one famous @entity114 honey badger named @entity117 was made famous in the @entity118 documentary @entity110 : masters of @entity120 aired on good friday this year			2
@entity117 repeatedly outfoxed his keepers escaping from his enclosure and even breaking into his owner 's house to raid the fridge .			0
