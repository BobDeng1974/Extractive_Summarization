the fighting was as fierce as i have ever known it			1
last night , 36 hours after world leaders agreed peace , a @entity6 base near the front line of the war was being violently , ruthlessly pounded by those who wished to be ruled by @entity10			1
here in @entity11 , the notion that conciliation could be found any time soon seemed ludicrous			0
this city is a key prize for the @entity17 separatists			0
@entity18 raged at the front lines on its eastern outskirts all day as the rebel tanks tried to push ahead			0
@entity6 positions were bombarded ceaselessly by rebel artillery in a bid to hoist the @entity10 flag over the town hall tonight			1
the deputy commander of the @entity6 37th @entity29 told me the rebels attacked 12 times			1
he expected the shelling of government positions that started at 5am yesterday to continue throughout the night			0
the officer said : ' our scouts and intelligence people saw the enemy bringing up scores of new , modern @entity10 tanks and armoured personnel carriers along the road from their positions at the town of @entity46 east of here			1
earlier , a @entity6 soldier who had been in the thick of fighting all day at the nearby town of @entity76 told me of the @entity17 separatists ' dawn mass attack			1
he said @entity6 forces replied with artillery and small groups of men with anti-armour weapons who moved forward to try to knock out rebel tanks			1
he said : ' we had to commit a lot of our forces there to prevent them from outflanking us			0
we 're managing to hold our positions but the fighting was hellish			0
' he reported casualties both among @entity6 troops and civilians			2
@entity96 's leaders are desperate to tamp down the conflict in @entity6			1
no wonder : it has intensified dramatically in the last week , leading to real fears of a full - blown war between the @entity57 and @entity10			1
@entity6 have watched their outgunned and outnumbered forces taking heavy casualties over the past days			2
ironically , the one event of the last week that actually cheered them was the one that @entity106 rightly feel most queasy about : the advance shipment of 20 @entity109 armoured cars to @entity6 , with another 55 on the way			2
the rugged vehicles , which are @entity112 , have since 1970 transported soldiers through battle zones			0
here , they have lifted morale			0
at one pub in the @entity6 capital of @entity121 on friday evening , a table of people stood up as someone toasted ' glory to the @entity124 '			2
@entity125 : ' @entity6 have watched their outgunned and outnumbered forces taking heavy casualties over the past days ' price of war : pro-russian separatists stand next to the body of a soldier who died just hours before a ceasefire with @entity6 soldiers was enforced the @entity134 have been delivered by a private firm which now owns them ; but are a hugely symbolic totem of @entity109 material			1
to many , they represent the ' tooling up ' of @entity6 by the @entity57 – the first palpable evidence of @entity106 having an interest in a conflict against @entity10			1
indeed , there is speculation here that the arrival of the @entity134 might herald a split in ranks with @entity150 and @entity151 , which are steadfastly against arming @entity6			2
on friday , @entity6 president @entity152 paraded himself proudly by one of the @entity134			2
soon they will be fitted out with guns			0
what will the effect be of images of @entity17 victims of @entity109 hand - me - downs ? no wonder alarm bells are ringing in @entity162 and @entity163			0
meanwhile , @entity164 and @entity165 have indicated they might supply @entity6 with weapons if the @entity17 forces break the ceasefire			1
@entity10 , predictably enough , has said it would view weapons supplies to @entity6 as a direct threat to its security			1
@entity174 's position is , of course , absurd			0
he denies supplying weapons and men to the rebels in @entity6 – but both @entity179 and @entity181 intelligence have no doubt he is lying			2
they say there is plenty of proof that @entity10 has not only been supplying the rebels with heavy weaponry but that @entity10 regular soldiers are fighting alongside the separatists			1
@entity164 ambassador to @entity6 , @entity191 , yesterday said satellite photos showed large numbers of weaponry being massed on the border with @entity6 and said that some of the tanks being used ' are @entity10 military , not separatist systems '			1
@entity191 added : ' the separatists now have more tanks , @entity200 , artillery and missile systems than some @entity96 @entity179 countries			0
' so now the ominous question is : are we being sucked , day by dangerous day , into a desperately perilous scenario ? are we being dragged into the unthinkable : a war with @entity10 ? conflict : @entity10 - backed separatist sniper plays with a dog as he and others wait for transport preparing to leave towards frontline , in the village of @entity216 , just outside @entity217 , eastern @entity6 consider this : the last time i was in this port city , last summer , i accompanied @entity6 forces who took it from @entity17 rebels after a short but vicious battle			1
then , both sides were poorly armed , mostly with @entity227 and a few mortars			0
most of the rebels fled and about 20 were killed			0
there were no civilian casualties or buildings destroyed			0
now the rebels – who want to carve out a @entity17 state and make no secret that they eventually would like to be absorbed into the @entity10 – have @entity10 tanks , armoured personnel carriers , artillery and multiple rocket launchers			2
the rebels ' arms can only be coming from @entity10			2
many western countries believe they are working according to a plan by @entity174 to rebuild a new @entity10 - led empire			1
those western politicians arguing for arming @entity6 compare @entity174 's actions to those of @entity249 snatching @entity250 , warning that appeasing him would only increase the dangers of more @entity253 aggression			0
others fear that it would be impossible to contain the conflict within @entity6 's borders and it would spill over into neighbouring countries that were former components of the @entity262 empire but are now @entity179 members – such as @entity264 and the @entity266 countries			1
@entity174 was a reluctant member at the peace talks last week			0
today will show whether he will risk edging @entity96 into an unimaginable conflagration … that is , unimaginable to anyone who knows nothing about the @entity272 .			0

@entity6 base bombed 36 hours after world leaders agreed ceasefire deal
@entity53 : ' the fighting was as fierce as i have ever known it '
conflict has raised fears of a ' full - blown war between the @entity57 and @entity10 '
