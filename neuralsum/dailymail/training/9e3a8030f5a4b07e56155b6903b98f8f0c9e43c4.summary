the @entity0 may have to scrap its plans to aggressively promote a 40 per cent national minimum wage hike now that the nonpartisan @entity3 found that the move would likely cost the @entity5 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016			1
the @entity3 's report , released tuesday afternoon , also estimated that it would pull 900,000 low - income americans above the federal government 's poverty line			2
the @entity0 did n't answer questions about whether that trade - off is acceptable to president @entity14 , but @entity16 @entity15 have pushed hard for legislation that would implement his goal of driving the minimum wage far above its current $ 7.25 level			1
but it quickly scheduled an afternoon conference call for reporters with @entity25 chairman @entity24 , and published a blog post so lengthy that it suggests the @entity0 had advance notice of the @entity3 's findings			0
president @entity14 posed with a group of workers before signing an executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $ 10.10 an hour -- but his larger effort , which requires @entity36 to act , is now meeting with the @entity3 's brick wall the @entity3 says as many as 1 million jobs might be lost after a minimum wage hike to $ 10.10 per hour , but determined that its ' central estimate ' was 500,000 jobs that article did n't mention the report 's 500,000 - job estimate , but argued more vaguely that @entity3 said ' raising the minimum wage would increase income for millions of middle - class families , on net , even after accounting for its estimates of job losses			1
' the president signed an executive order on february 12 setting $ 10.10 as the minimum wage for employees working on new federal contracts , and has said he wants legislators to expand his order to the entire country			1
a conservative policy group , the @entity58 , has predicted the @entity3 's findings for years , saying that a $ 10.10 minimum wage would kill between 360,000 and 1 million jobs , mostly those of young , low - skill workers who would be the first to go if employers were forced to pay higher salaries out of the same pool of money			1
the group 's research director , @entity67 , said tuesday that @entity14 's plan would be ' a blunt instrument to fix the very complicated issue of poverty in @entity5			1
' ' nearly 60 percent of the working - age poor do n’t have a job and would n’t be affected by a raise , ' he said			0
' of those who would receive a raise , a forthcoming study from @entity79 and @entity80 economists find just 13 percent live in poor families			0
' @entity86 @entity85 senator @entity85 quickly piled on			0
' whether it 's @entity88 , a minimum wage hike or a trillion - dollar stimulus bill charged to the nation ’s credit card , the bottom line is the president 's big - government experiment kills jobs , ' he said			1
' it has made things worse not only for @entity5 who continue to look for a job , but also for the millions of @entity5 who have altogether given up looking for work			0
' @entity102 labor has organized protests across the country to demand a minimum - wage hike , since many union contracts include higher wages that rise whenever the minimum wage goes up @entity16 @entity110 minority leader @entity110 's re-election campaign issued a statement after the @entity3 published its report , comparing its dour findings to news about @entity88			1
liberals , he said , ' promise a world full of prosperity , but the reality of their policies is fewer jobs and less opportunity for our most vulnerable			0
' but the @entity14 administration went on full alert			0
in his conference call , @entity24 told reporters that the @entity3 was dead wrong , and its report ' does not reflect the consensus view of economists who have said the minimum wage would have little to no impact on employment			2
' tuesday 's news will put pressure on @entity15 and labor unions to justify their call for a higher minimum wage as a net benefit to the @entity5 economy			1
' it goes outside the consensus view of economists when it comes to the impact of the minimum wage on employment , ' he said			0
' our view is that " zero " is a perfectly reasonable estimate of the impact of the minimum wage on employment			0
' the @entity0 has planned to spend much of next week promoting president @entity14 's plan as a boon to jobs and the economy , and as a social justice issue aimed at better treatment of @entity5 's poor			1
the president and his surrogates are likely to point to the @entity3 's other findings , including that ' many more low - wage workers would see an increase in their earnings , ' and that ' a few higher - wage workers would owe their jobs and increased earnings to the heightened demand for goods and services that would result			2
' @entity3 's economists called a loss of 500,000 jobs its ' central estimate , ' but said there is great uncertainty attached to it			2
a ' very slight ' reduction in jobs could also result , they cautioned , or job losses as large as 1 million			0
overall , 16.5 million @entity5 workers would see higher pay if the minimum wage were increased			2
the president claimed in his weekend radio address that ' raising the minimum wage ... would lift wages for about 28 million @entity5			2
it would lift millions of @entity5 out of poverty , and help millions more work their way out of poverty – without requiring a single dollar in new taxes or spending			0
separately , the @entity3 wrote last week that the @entity88 , the president 's signature health insurance overhaul law , would drive the equivalent of 2.5 million full - time jobs out of the @entity5 economy by the year 2024			1
--- mr. @entity195 has worked in the past for the firm that manages the @entity58 .			0

president @entity14 has demanded a national hike in the minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour
he signed an executive order last week making that move for federal contract employees
but the @entity3 now says a national push for that wage floor would likely remove 500,000 jobs from the @entity5 economy
the @entity0 had planned to spend next week promoting the wage hike idea , *hoping* to *convince* @entity36 to act
the @entity3 also said that 900,000 @entity5 would be hoisted above the poverty level if the wage went up according to @entity14 's plan
