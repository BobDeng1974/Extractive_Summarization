by @entity0 @entity1 , the tv detective , has always been good at collaring her man , but not so efficient at finding one for herself			1
the first three series of the popular @entity6 drama have been all about her police work rather than her private life , but as the fourth series gets underway , @entity3 , who plays her , suggests that may be about to change			1
' watch this space , ' she teases			1
' my feeling is that @entity1 had romantic attachments in the past ... and she may do again in the future			1
i know the public would like her to become romantically involved			2
i get letters from all over the world suggesting it			2
" @entity1 , " they write			1
" why she no boyfriend , she lovely ! " ' @entity3 says that the fourth series of @entity1 might see a more personal side to the detective @entity3 herself has been with her partner @entity25 , the former head of graphic design at the @entity27 , for three decades and they married in june 2010			1
they 've obviously cracked it as far as compatibility is concerned , but @entity3 is n't about to go all mushy when she reveals their secret to domestic bliss			1
' i think it helps that i 'm up in @entity38 half the time filming @entity1 , so long may it continue , ' she laughs			1
' but seriously , i genuinely think it 's about having our own space			2
we have a place on the coast in my hometown of @entity46 in @entity47 , and even when we 're there we sit in separate rooms , @entity25 with his music in one , me with my crossword in another			2
we have so little in common but the relationship obviously works			2
@entity25 makes me laugh like nobody else does , and i think he likes me for my honesty and my kindness			2
' although the honesty can irritate him			2
i 've sometimes come home from auditions and told him i 've recommended somebody else for the role rather than me , and that really gets on his nerves			2
" why do you always put yourself second @entity3 ? " he says			1
" why do you talk about who else would be good for the part , rather than you ? do n't do that ! " @entity3 receives fan mail asking why @entity1 has n't got a romantic partner ' but i ca n't help it and i do n't think it 's damaged my career			1
i could n't have wanted the part that much if i were recommending somebody else , and if i were thinking about a particular person for the role the chances are the producers were too			2
' but i have an urge to be honest , whatever the situation			2
i 'm trying to sell my home in south @entity80 at the moment , and i know i 'd have to tell any potential buyer all its little flaws , and @entity25 knows i would too			2
no wonder the estate agent does n't want me around while he 's showing people the house			2
' @entity3 , 68 , is refreshingly honest about pretty much everything			1
when she says she never wanted children , for example , you absolutely believe her			0
' @entity92 i 've wished i had but it 's been so fleeting that it 's not been a bother to me			0
the things i wish i had done i 've done , wherever possible			0
i wanted to run a marathon so i did the @entity80 one in 2002 , 2003 and 2004 and was really pleased with myself , although i thought i might be brought home in a box ! but i had to do it even though i was never the quickest			0
the person next to me on the starting line one year , a gentleman of 93 , was quicker than me ! ' now my aim is to learn a foreign language because one of the greatest regrets in my life has been not doing that			0
i studied @entity108 for a movie i did called @entity110 about five years ago			0
i went on a crash course for three weeks but then i forgot it all , so now i 'm taking @entity108 lessons again whenever i go down to @entity46			0
i 'm determined to crack it			0
' comparisons between @entity3 and @entity1 are not easy to find			1
the actress is far more glamorous than her alter ego			0
slim and glowing , @entity3 arrives for our meeting in a black chiffon blouse and a cream trouser suit , topped off with stylishly coiffed copper - coloured hair , while @entity1 's happy to waddle around in several layers of unflattering clothing and a green fisherman 's hat			1
when asked at a wedding recently why @entity1 's so frumpy , @entity3 replied , ' because that 's the way she 's written in @entity130 ' original books			1
making her glamorous would be like making @entity131 a vegetarian			0
' it is @entity3 's total dedication to a role that led her to two @entity137 nominations , for her performances in @entity139 in 1996 and @entity140 two years later			1
and she takes @entity1 , which regularly attracts more than 6 million viewers , just as seriously			1
@entity3 says that her character @entity1 is so frumpy because that is how she is written in the novel while she 's up in the north - east filming for months on end @entity3 immerses herself in local life to give herself a better understanding of @entity1 's @entity151 culture			1
' i love it when people feel they own @entity1 , ' she says			1
' when they know we 're filming in the area they come out of their homes with tables and chairs and watch us , offering us cups of tea and cakes and occasionally glasses of wine			0
i love the fact that people want to be close to the show and that they like it so much and pay me compliments when they see me around @entity171			0
' and i do whatever i can to make it successful			0
i made the mistake of losing @entity1 's distinctive hat a while ago , and although i found it again i made sure there 'd never be an occasion where @entity1 was potentially hatless again			1
i tracked down the same hat to a fishing shop in @entity171 and bought one , and then i ordered four more like it online			0
' ' making @entity1 glamorous would be like making @entity131 a vegetarian			1
' one of nine children , @entity3 - born @entity184 - had a poor but happy upbringing , and remains refreshingly down - to - earth despite being one of our most in - demand actresses			1
' to be good at what i do means everything , ' she says			0
' i 'm a working - class girl and i 'm really happy when the producers and directors are happy with what i 'm doing on @entity1			1
i 'd find failing at my job embarrassing and humiliating , and i know @entity1 would too			1
she 's been known to bend the rules , but she always tries to do the right thing and always knows what the right thing to do is			0
i 'm not sure people necessarily know what the right thing to do is any more , or are even allowed to do it in our society			0
' when i was growing up we were all taught you should n't answer a policeman back , that there were consequences if you were n't considerate or stole something			0
now you get several chances before you even get reprimanded			0
' things started to change when discipline was taken away from parents and teachers			0
i do n't condone corporal punishment and i know laws were brought in because children were being abused			0
but have the abusers stopped ? i doubt it			0
and parents and teachers who would have disciplined their children are n't allowed to do it any more			0
something 's gone wrong with society and it needs to change			0
' @entity1 , tomorrow , 8pm , @entity6 .			1
