by @entity0 published : 20:19 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 06:42 est , 15 june 2012 court battle : @entity2 outside the @entity3 in @entity4 where he is fighting for his £ 650,000 jackpot a gambler dubbed ' the man who could n't lose ' after winning £ 650,000 in just three hours of online gaming is facing a @entity3 bid to strip him of his jackpot			1
@entity2 , 41 , was left ' euphoric ' after turning the € 20 in his account into a whopping € 707,000 - then worth roughly £ 650,000 - whilst playing @entity16 's ' @entity15 ' game in 2009			1
but @entity18 - based @entity17 , which operated the website , insists a software bug meant chance had nothing to do with it			1
as he was mistakenly charged for only one in six of his bets , his winnings are null and void , the company claims			0
@entity17 refused to pay up , sparking a legal battle - which judge @entity30 said reminded him of the 1935 film , ' @entity8 '			1
the film , inspired by a @entity34 music hall song based on the story of @entity8 , is a romantic comedy which tells the story of a former @entity39 aristocrat who wins 10million francs playing baccarat at a casino			1
the casino sends a beautiful woman to lure him back to the gambing tables and he is eventually left penniless			0
pet shop worker , mr @entity2 - who had won only meager sums in his previous two years using the website - says he logged on from his home in @entity50 , @entity51 , on january 28 , 2009 , completely unaware of what was about to unfold			1
the company claims an error caused by a software upgrade meant mr @entity2 was charged for only one in six of the 6,670 wagers he placed , dramatically increasing his chances of winning the lottery - style game , which has since been removed from the internet			1
@entity61 , for @entity17 , said the bug meant it was ' mathematically inevitable ' that mr @entity2 would keep hitting the jackpot			1
the court heard the @entity51 started playing at 8.18pm , placing his usual 20 cent bet , but began increasing the stakes as his apparent luck continued			1
he had won 5,000 euros by 9pm , and racked up winnings of 200,000 euros by 10.10pm , as he frantically placed as many multiple wagers as the website would allow			2
speaking through an interpreter , mr @entity2 told the court : ' i had always lost previously ... but when i started to win i had a very good feeling			1
i 'm a player and my instincts told me to keep betting			0
' mr @entity2 played the @entity77 game for three - and - a - half hours comparison : high court judge @entity30 said case reminded him of the 1935 film @entity8 , starring @entity82 the ' original ' man who broke the bank at @entity85 was @entity8 ( 1841 – 1922 )			1
his exploits were celebrated in the popular @entity34 music hall song of the same name , written in 1892 by @entity89			0
in @entity94 , if a gambler wins more chips than are available at a table , they are said to have ' faire sauter la banque ' , which literally means to ' blow up the bank ' but is usually translated as ' breaking the bank '			0
on the event all the chips were won a black shroud was placed over the table until replacement chips were brought in			0
in july 1891 @entity8 went to @entity85 with £ 4,000 that he had defrauded from investors with his bogus invention of a ' musical jump rope '			1
in an eleven - hour session @entity8 won a million francs as he ' broke the bank ' twelve times			1
at one stage he won 23 times out of 30 successive spins of the roulette wheel			0
@entity8 returned to @entity85 in november of that year and won again			2
during this session he made another million francs in three days , including successful bets on the roulette coming up on the number five for five consecutive turns			0
@entity8 used a risky ' martingale system ' , where the gambler doubles his bet after every loss , so a win recovers all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake , and he admitted his success was just a lucky streak			2
the song helped @entity8 to become a celebrity			2
but he died penniless after losing all his money on failed inventions , having also defrauded his investors			0
mr @entity135 challenged him , saying he must have realised that something was wrong , but mr @entity2 insisted : ' how could i realise there was an error ? ' there was no message , i was just drawing , i did n't have a clue ...			2
i thought i was very lucky			0
' the @entity51 , who disputes that any error took place , stopped playing shortly before midnight , having amassed a colossal 707,665 euros in 217 heady minutes			2
when asked why he called it a day , mr @entity2 replied : ' i realised the amount that i was winning and i realised that i had to stop			2
i had been lucky enough ... i am only human			0
i was taken by the emotions and there was a lot of euphoria			0
' he added : ' i 've never had so much money ... it 's a very big win ; it 's not something that happens every day			0
' mr @entity2 , who offered to come to @entity156 to pick up his winnings in cash , said an operator told him ' this is incredible , but it does happen ' as he transferred some of his winnings to a different online account			2
the company , based in @entity164 , is refusing to pay mr @entity2 , saying the bets breached the website 's terms and conditions , and his winnings amounted to ' unjust enrichment '			1
refuting those claims , mr @entity2 's barrister , @entity170 , said : ' mr @entity2 denies any software error as alleged by the defendant			1
' the defendant has failed to establish that mr @entity2 broke any rules of the game whilst playing and obtaining the winnings			2
' he added : ' mr @entity2 performed his part of the game by completing various steps and screens presented to him by the defendant on the website , and paid for his bets on the game from the funds in his account			0
' he did everything that was required of him to pay for the bets			0
' if his account was not charged at any time for the repeat bets , which is not admitted , that omission was due to the defendant 's failure to completely perform its obligations to him , and to comply with its regulatory requirements			0
' the hearing , taking place at the @entity197 , continues			0
@entity18 - based @entity17 , which operated the @entity51 website , insists a software bug helped mr @entity2 win			1

@entity2 , 41 , won £ 650,000 off £ 18 stake in just three hours
@entity18 - based site insists a software bug meant chance had nothing to do with the @entity51 's winnings
high court judge said case reminded him of the 1935 film , ' @entity8 '
