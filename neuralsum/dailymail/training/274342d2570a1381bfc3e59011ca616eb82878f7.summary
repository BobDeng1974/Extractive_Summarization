by @entity1 reporter published : 22:47 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 23:01 est , 17 august 2012 the @entity3 military trainers handed the new recruit , @entity4 , his @entity5 to defend his remote @entity7 village			1
he turned around and immediately used it , spraying the @entity3 with bullets and killing two - the latest of nine @entity3 service personnel gunned down in two weeks by their supposed @entity7 allies			1
the shooting in western @entity14 province was not the only such attack friday			0
hours later a few provinces away in @entity18 , an @entity7 soldier wounded two more coalition servicemen			2
one turncoat attack per month raised eyebrows last year			0
one per week caused concern earlier this year			0
but when @entity7 forces turn their guns on international trainers twice in a day - as they now have two weeks in a row - it 's hard to argue there 's not something going on			1
the question is , what is it ? infiltration : inside attacks on coalition forces in @entity7 have risen from 11 in 2011 to 29 so far in 2012 the @entity3 - led alliance says it 's too soon to tell what 's behind the rash of insider attacks			1
the most likely explanations : either the @entity40 are increasingly infiltrating the @entity7 police and army , or relations between @entity7 and @entity3 forces are turning toxic - or both			1
' there 's no positive spin on this , ' said @entity49 , an analyst with the @entity51 - based @entity50 who has advised the top @entity3 generals in @entity54			2
he said the number of @entity7 insider attacks has risen beyond what can be explained as isolated incidents			1
that 's bad news for the @entity3 exit strategy for @entity7 , which has seen @entity51 spend more than $ 20 billion on training and equipping a nearly 340,000 - member @entity7 security force on the assumption that it would eventually be strong enough to fight the @entity40 on its own			1
the coalition has downplayed the insider attacks as anomalies and mostly a result of personal grievances , even as their numbers soared from 11 last year to 29 so far in 2012			1
the alliance says only about 10 per cent of the attacks were related to infiltration by the @entity40 insurgency			0
but that analysis was done before the latest furious spate of seven attacks in 11 days , a frequency that suggests some type of coordination			2
@entity3 defense secretary @entity82 called the recent attacks ' sporadic ' and not a long - term trend ' whether or not these specific events turn out to be insurgent - initiated ... we 're just going to have to do the investigations and figure that out , ' said @entity89 , a spokesman for the @entity3 - led coalition			1
the problem has become so pronounced in the @entity7 war that all @entity3 forces there are now being instructed to carry loaded weapons - even on base - as a precaution against insider attacks , a @entity3 official said friday in @entity51			1
the official spoke on condition of anonymity because policy forbids discussing military procedures			0
some historians are hard - pressed to find precedent for this in previous wars			0
' i have never heard of anything in @entity110 comparable to what we have recently experienced in @entity7 , ' said @entity113 , a political science professor at @entity114 in @entity115 who has written extensively about the @entity116			2
a @entity118 military expert on colonial wars , @entity120 , said the level of these types of attacks were ' almost unheard of ' in any conflict he 'd studied			0
@entity49 said the insider attacks have ' tremendous strategic impact ' beyond the 36 coalition forces killed this year because they damage morale among international troops and further weaken support for the war in the @entity3 and other @entity133 nations training @entity7 soldiers and police to take over security nationwide by 2014			1
what 's unclear , he added , is how much influence the @entity40 actually have in organizing the increasing numbers of attacks			0
discord : @entity7 security personnel said in a may 2011 @entity144 survey they found @entity3 troops ' extremely arrogant , bullying and unwilling to listen ' the insurgents have been happy to take credit			1
the @entity40 's supreme leader , mullah @entity149 , boasted thursday that the insurgents ' have cleverly infiltrated into the ranks of the enemy ' and were killing a rising number of @entity3 - led coalition forces			2
defense secretary @entity82 told @entity1 in an interview this week that the attacks may reflect the @entity40 's use of unconventional tactics against a coalition force it can not defeat on the battlefield			0
he added that @entity3 military commanders say such attacks still remain ' sporadic ' and not a long - term trend			1
' the enemy is infiltrating because they see it 's very easy ' friday 's deadly shooting in @entity14 , at least by the accounts of local @entity7 officials , seemed unlikely to be a personal dispute			0
@entity4 , a man in his 30s , had joined the @entity172 just five days earlier			0
he opened fire during an inauguration ceremony attended by @entity3 and @entity7 forces in @entity178 village , @entity14 provincial police chief @entity173 said			1
' as soon as they gave the weapon to @entity4 to begin training , he took the gun and opened fire toward the @entity3 soldiers , ' @entity173 said			2
the police chief added that he had warned @entity3 forces organizing and training the community not to move too fast to recruit in the village , which he said is heavily influenced by the @entity40			2
vulnerable : @entity7 military analyst @entity191 says the @entity40 is infiltrating @entity7 security forces ' because they see it 's very easy ' @entity7 military analyst @entity191 has no doubt that @entity40 infiltration of @entity7 security forces is rising			1
he said that despite new methods of screening , it 's simple to forge documents and invent references in @entity7			0
' the gate is wide open			0
the enemy is infiltrating because they see it 's very easy , ' @entity191 said			0
but the turncoat attacks may also reflect growing mistrust and resentment among @entity7 working with international forces			2
@entity7 soldiers interviewed by the @entity1 earlier this year offered their own explanations : the @entity7 feel disrespected , the soldiers said			0
they complained of getting inferior equipment and condescending treatment by @entity3			0
in may 2011 , a @entity144 team led by a behavioral scientist compiled a survey that indicated many @entity7 security personnel found @entity3 troops ' extremely arrogant , bullying and unwilling to listen to their advice			1
' ' i think infiltration is easier to address , actually , ' @entity49 said			0
' i think the worse thing is , if your entire strategy going forward from the next three or four years depends on partnering with @entity7 forces , then if relations have already devolved to this degree , you 're really worried			0
' the @entity228 late friday strongly condemned coordinated terrorist attacks in various parts of the country on tuesday and wednesday and reiterated its serious concern ' at threats posed by the @entity40 , @entity234 and illegal armed groups to the local population , national security forces , international military and international assistance efforts in @entity7			1

the @entity3 military has spent more than $ 20 billion on training and equipping a nearly 340,000 - member @entity7 security force
insider attacks have risen from 11 in 2011 to 29 so far in 2012
