by @entity0 published : 06:53 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 18:57 est , 26 february 2013 @entity1 and @entity2 always knew they wanted a baby of their own			1
but with @entity1 unable to have children because of a rare genetic condition , they realised they might need some help to make their dream of a family come true			1
in the end , that help came from close to home			0
@entity2 ’s older sister , @entity18 , and @entity1 ’s younger sister , @entity19 , joined forces to help them bring their daughter @entity21 into the world			1
@entity19 provided the egg while @entity18 carried the baby for nine months			0
sibling support : @entity2 and @entity26 ( back ) with their surrogate baby @entity21 born from @entity1 's sister - in - law @entity18 ( front right ) using eggs donated by her sister @entity19 ( front left ) ‘ if it was n’t for our sisters we would still be childless , ’ said mrs @entity26 , 31			1
‘ it ’s the best gift ever and we love them so much for it			0
i always knew i wanted to be a mother			0
it was just a question of how			0
’ mr @entity2 , 33 , added : ‘ we still ca n’t believe we are parents			2
we feel like the luckiest couple alive			0
‘ @entity21 is our little angel and we ’ll forever be thankful to our sisters for making our dream come true			1
’ mrs @entity26 , a primary school teacher , has a genetic condition that means she has no reproductive organs			1
it was diagnosed when she was a girl and she remembers tearfully telling @entity19 of her sorrow that she would never be a mother			0
it was then that @entity19 promised to donate one of her own eggs when the time came			0
years later , married and desperate to start a family , mrs @entity26 asked her little sister if she had really meant what she said			1
proud : @entity2 and @entity1 are the proud parents of a baby girl who was created with the help of their amazing sisters mother and daughter together : @entity1 and @entity2 decided to call her @entity21 - the middle name of the nan whose bequest financed their treatment ‘ i cried when @entity19 said she would still donate her eggs for me , ’ she recalled			1
‘ it meant that , genetically , the baby would be linked to both me and @entity2			1
’ but @entity19 , who had a boyfriend , and no children of her own , decided against carrying the baby for her sister as well			2
‘ we knew she would n’t be a surrogate too because the baby would feel too much like hers , ’ mrs @entity26 said			1
‘ it would have been hard for her to have her first pregnancy and then hand the baby to me			0
’ the @entity80 , who live in a £ 400,000 detached house in @entity82 , @entity83 , were reluctant to find a stranger to act as a surrogate after hearing stories about women who demanded to keep the baby at the last minute			2
but when mr @entity2 told his older sister @entity18 , 35 , about the problem she offered to help			2
promise : @entity1 's sister @entity19 ( left ) came to her aid by keeping a childhood promise to donate her eggs which were fertilised by @entity2 whose sister @entity18 ( right ) then acted as a surrogate girl power : @entity26 ( centre ) on her wedding day with her sister @entity19 ( left ) and sister in law @entity18 after three children with her printer husband , @entity105 , she felt her family was complete and was sure she would be able to happily hand the baby over after nine months of pregnancy			1
so the agreement was made			0
mrs @entity26 ’s sister would provide the egg , mr @entity2 would fertilise it and it would be implanted into his sister , who would carry the baby			1
our beautiful girl : newborn baby @entity116 taking a bath over the next few months , mr @entity2 ’s sperm was frozen , while his sister and sister - in - law were given hormone injections – one to build the lining of her womb and the other to help her produce more eggs to be harvested			1
two embryos were implanted in @entity18 in december 2011 and she discovered she was pregnant on @entity127			0
the 20 - week scan revealed the family were expecting one baby , a girl			0
she was named @entity21 and given the second name @entity116 – in honour of her great - grandmother , who had left a bequest that paid for the £ 8,000 private @entity137 treatment			2
@entity21 was born at @entity138 , @entity82 , on september 1 last year			2
mrs @entity26 said : ‘ i held her for the first time and looked at @entity19 , @entity18 and @entity2			1
it was incredible that every single one of us had helped bring @entity21 into the world			2
‘ @entity21 is very much our own – our own little miracle			2
’ @entity19 , a 27 - year - old charity administrator , who lives with the @entity80 , said : ‘ i just adore @entity21 , she ’s absolutely wonderful			0
‘ but although my eggs were used to create her , she will always be my niece			0
’ @entity18 , who runs an after - school club , said : ‘ carrying the baby was something i was happy to do for them			0
i knew that she was n’t mine and i focused on that			0
’ long search : @entity1 and @entity2 started exploring the possibility of finding a surrogate stranger - but were put off by stories of some who dropped out or became too attached to the baby , then there sisters came to the rescue family affair : how one caring family came together to help their loved ones have the baby they 'd always dreamed of			1

@entity26 has a rare genetic *disorder* meaning she can never have children
@entity1 and husband @entity2 used @entity1 's sister 's eggs while @entity2 's sister acted as a surrogate
@entity1 and @entity2 's dream has now come true and they are mother and father to baby @entity21
