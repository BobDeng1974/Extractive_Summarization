nearly half the families in the country have just one child , according to an official analysis			1
it found the number of one - child families has increased by almost 700,000 in 15 years , and they are likely to be in the majority within a decade			1
the @entity8 said larger families are under pressure because of ‘ the greater challenge of combining work with childcare with three or more children compared with one or two ’			1
almost half of families now only have one child , new analysis from the @entity8 reveals many families can no longer afford to have more than a single baby , experts said			1
most mothers now have to go out to work to pay the bills			0
and those who stay at home to bring up their children are increasingly penalised by the tax and benefit system			2
when the @entity28 started asking about the size of families in 1996 , there were just over three million with a mother , father and one child – around 42 per cent of all families with children			1
last year there were 3.7million , or 47 per cent of all families with children			1
some critics fear the decline of the traditional family with 2.4 children may lead to a generation of ‘ little emperors ’ , a phrase coined in @entity44 , where the rule of one child for every couple is said to have produced millions of spoilt youngsters			1
the survey found there are now three million families with two children , roughly the same as in the mid- 1990s			1
but as a share of all families , two - child households had fallen from 41 per cent to 39 per cent			1
since 1996 , one - child families have increased in number to 3,663,000 , while the number of larger families has fallen the average number of children in a family is now 1.7 , compared to more than two a generation ago , while the @entity8 found larger families are more like to not have a parent in work dr @entity65 , of @entity66 , says : ' there is a concern that singletons will not learn to share , and will grown up " spoiled "			1
there is however little evidence for this			0
' though children do learn a great deal from siblings , and generally benefit from the cooperation and competition they practice on a daily basis among siblings , singletons also live in a world populated by other people , with whom they identify and with whom they have to compete , and with whom they learn to share			2
' they have many opportunities to learn from their friends about closeness and conflict ; they have many opportunities to learn that they can not have everything their own way ; they have many opportunities to learn that they gain a great deal through sharing			0
' humans are naturally social beings , and generally want to contribute to their society			0
' incidentally , singletons tend to be very curious about what having a sibling would be like , and wonder what kind of a sibling they would make			0
' @entity103 , research assistant at @entity66 's @entity104 adds : ' research to date seems to indicate that it is the quality of family relationships , rather than the number of people in a family , that matters most for children 's social , psychological and emotional well - being			1
' some of our latest research has been on single women who have used a sperm donor to have a child			1
some of these homes are comprised of mother and ( only ) child and these children seem to be functioning well			1
' the biggest decline came among families with three or more children			2
there were more than 1.3million such families in 1996 , but only 1.1million in 2012			1
they formed 14 per cent of all families with children , compared with 17 per cent in 1996			1
the number of big families has remained relatively high largely because of the impact of @entity133 and @entity134 migrants , among whom there is less expectation that mothers should work and bigger families are more common			2
the report said high proportions of families with three or more children can be found in @entity141 , parts of the @entity143 , including @entity144 , and parts of the @entity146 , including @entity147			1
it added : ‘ this may be related to the ethnicities of people living in these areas , as previous research has shown fertility rates in the @entity155 are higher among women born in @entity134 and @entity133 than women born in the @entity155			2
’ the authoritative survey , based on a sample of 130,000 people across @entity155 , found parents with large families are more likely to live on state benefits than those with smaller ones			2
only 5 per cent of couples with one or two children are workless , the report said , but 13 per cent of those with three or more are dependent on benefits			0
‘ families with one or two dependent children are more likely to have at least one employed parent than those with three or more dependent children , ’ the report said			2
the insurance company @entity176 , which monitors the cost of raising children , said : ‘ our latest @entity179 unearthed a similar trend to the @entity8 data			0
‘ the practicalities such as feeding and clothing are expensive enough , but if a parent wants to return to work and childcare fees come into play , this takes the cost of a child to a whole new level			0
one - child families could well become the norm			1
’ a map of @entity196 and @entity197 reveals larger families concentrated in areas with higher proportions of women born in @entity134 and @entity133 around 15 per cent of households in the @entity155 have three or more children , putting it seventh in the @entity205 league table @entity206 with her daughter @entity207 parents who choose to have only one child face being called lazy and selfish , according to mother - of - one @entity206			1
she said she has been challenged repeatedly by friends and families over when she and husband @entity212 are planning a younger brother or sister for daughter , @entity207 ‘ the idea of a huge close - knit ¬ family , living constantly in each other ’s pockets , never held any attraction for me			2
it sounded far too chaotic and claustrophobic , ’ she wrote last year			0
‘ my rule of thumb has always been that there should never be more children than bathrooms in a home			0
‘ before you have children , people hold back a little			0
after all , you may have undisclosed fertility problems and be secretly desperate for a baby			0
‘ but once you ’ve had one child , it ’s open season			0
people just ask outright as if they ’re talking about the local bus service : ‘ so , when ’s number two going to arrive ? ’ ‘ my view is that , unlike parents of large families , we will be able to devote all our time , money and love into turning @entity207 into a happy , confident little girl			2
and a raft of recent research backs us up			0
‘ obviously one key factor is that we ’re all feeling the economic pinch , with parents simply unable to afford the extra cost of another child ( a staggering £ 1,800 before they ’re even born , according to one survey last month )			0
‘ another huge factor in the rise of single - child families is the trend for women to have babies later in life			1
@entity155 birth records show that a woman having her first child at 35 is much less likely than a 25 year old to have more children			2
as fertility declines post- 35 , many women just run out of time			0
‘ at the end of the day , it ’s not about romance , money , the agony of childbirth or all the research that proves how damaging sibling rivalry can be			0
‘ the honest truth is that @entity207 is all i want			0
she ’s perfect and i ’m done			0
so no matter how many times i ’m asked when i ’ll be having my next one , i wo n’t be changing my mind			0

in 1996 there were *3.1million* only - child families , rising to 3.7million in 2012
money worries and women waiting to have children *blamed* for change
one in four families have three or more children in parts of @entity141
