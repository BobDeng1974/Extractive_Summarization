a chilly @entity1 summer has left 533,000 more square miles of ocean covered with ice than at the same time last year – an increase of 29 per cent			1
the rebound from 2012 ’s record low comes six years after the @entity9 reported that global warming would leave the @entity1 ice - free in summer by 2013			1
instead , days before the annual autumn re-freeze is due to begin , an unbroken ice sheet more than half the size of @entity15 already stretches from the @entity17 islands to @entity19 ’s northern shores			2
on september 4 , @entity30 , based at the @entity34 , stated on its website that in august 2013 the @entity1 ice cover recovered by a record 2.38 million sq km – 919,000 sq miles – from its 2012 low			1
news of this figure was widely reported – including by @entity39 - on september 8			1
but on september 10 , the @entity30 quietly changed it to 1.38 million sq km ( 533,000 sq miles ) – and replaced the original document so the old figure no longer shows up on a main @entity44 search			1
it can now only be found on an old ‘ cached ’ page			0
the figures in this article have now been corrected			0
prompted by an inquiry from ‘ green ’ blogger @entity50 , the @entity30 ’s spokeswoman @entity48 said the mistake was a ‘ typographical error ’ , telling him : ‘ there are no plans to make a statement on the change because it was not an error in the data			2
’ the @entity60 from the @entity61 to the @entity62 has remained blocked by pack - ice all year			1
more than 20 yachts that had planned to sail it have been left ice - bound and a cruise ship attempting the route was forced to turn back			1
some eminent scientists now believe the world is heading for a period of cooling that will not end until the middle of this century – a process that would expose computer forecasts of imminent catastrophic warming as dangerously misleading			2
the disclosure comes 11 months after @entity77 triggered intense political and scientific debate by revealing that global warming has ‘ paused ’ since the beginning of 1997 – an event that the computer models used by climate experts failed to predict			1
in march , this newspaper further revealed that temperatures are about to drop below the level that the models forecast with ‘ 90 per cent certainty ’			0
the pause – which has now been accepted as real by every major climate research centre – is important , because the models ’ predictions of ever - increasing global temperatures have made many of the world ’s economies divert billions of pounds into ‘ green ’ measures to counter climate change			1
those predictions now appear gravely flawed			0
the continuing furore caused by @entity77 ’s revelations – which will now be amplified by the return of the @entity1 ice sheet – has forced the @entity104 ’s climate change body to reconsider its position			1
the @entity104 @entity106 ( @entity106 ) was due in october to start publishing its @entity107 – a huge three - volume study issued every six or seven years			1
it will hold a pre-summit in @entity110 later this month			2
only six years ago , the @entity9 reported that the @entity1 would be ice - free in summer by 2013 , citing a scientist in the @entity25 who claimed this was a ‘ conservative ’ forecast			1
perhaps it was their confidence that led more than 20 yachts to try to sail the @entity60 from the @entity61 to the @entity62 this summer			2
as of last week , all these vessels were stuck in the ice , some at the eastern end of the passage in @entity121 , others further west at @entity123			2
shipping experts said the only way these vessels were likely to be freed was by the icebreakers of the @entity17 coastguard			0
according to the official @entity17 government website , the @entity60 has remained ice - bound and impassable all summer			1
the @entity9 ’s 2007 report quoted scientist professor @entity131 , who based his views on super-computer models and the fact that ‘ we use a high - resolution regional model for the @entity1 and sea ice ’			1
he was confident his results were ‘ much more realistic ’ than other projections , which ‘ underestimate the amount of heat delivered to the sea ice ’			2
also quoted was @entity142 expert professor @entity143			0
he backed professor @entity131 , saying his model was ‘ more efficient ’ than others because it ‘ takes account of processes that happen internally in the ice ’			2
he added : ‘ this is not a cycle ; not just a fluctuation			0
in the end , it will all just melt away quite suddenly			0
’ leaked documents show that governments which support and finance the @entity106 are demanding more than 1,500 changes to the report ’s ‘ summary for policymakers ’			2
they say its current draft does not properly explain the pause			0
at the heart of the row lie two questions : the extent to which temperatures will rise with carbon dioxide levels , as well as how much of the warming over the past 150 years – so far , just 0.8c – is down to human greenhouse gas emissions and how much is due to natural variability			2
in its draft report , the @entity106 says it is ‘ 95 per cent confident ’ that global warming has been caused by humans – up from 90 per cent in 2007			1
this claim is already hotly disputed			0
@entity25 climate expert professor @entity178 said last night : ‘ in fact , the uncertainty is getting bigger			0
it ’s now clear the models are way too sensitive to carbon dioxide			0
i can not see any basis for the @entity106 increasing its confidence level			0
’ she pointed to long - term cycles in ocean temperature , which have a huge influence on climate and suggest the world may be approaching a period similar to that from 1965 to 1975 , when there was a clear cooling trend			1
this led some scientists at the time to forecast an imminent ice age			0
professor @entity198 , of the @entity199 , was one of the first to investigate the ocean cycles			0
he said : ‘ we are already in a cooling trend , which i think will continue for the next 15 years at least			0
there is no doubt the warming of the 1980s and 1990s has stopped			0
then ... @entity28 satellite images showing the spread of @entity1 sea ice 27th august 2012 ... and now , much bigger : the same @entity28 image taken in 2013 ‘ the @entity106 claims its models show a pause of 15 years can be expected			1
but that means that after only a very few years more , they will have to admit they are wrong			0
’ others are more cautious			0
dr @entity216 , of @entity217 , drew the graph published by @entity77 in march showing how far world temperatures have diverged from computer predictions			0
he admitted the cycles may have caused some of the recorded warming , but insisted that natural variability alone could not explain all of the temperature rise over the past 150 years			1
nonetheless , the belief that summer @entity1 ice is about to disappear remains an @entity106 tenet , frequently flung in the face of critics who point to the pause			1
yet there is mounting evidence that @entity1 ice levels are cyclical			1
data uncovered by climate historians show that there was a massive melt in the 1920s and 1930s , followed by intense re-freezes that ended only in 1979 – the year the @entity106 says that shrinking began			0
professor @entity178 said the ice ’s behaviour over the next five years would be crucial , both for understanding the climate and for future policy			1
‘ arctic sea ice is the indicator to watch , ’ she said .			0
