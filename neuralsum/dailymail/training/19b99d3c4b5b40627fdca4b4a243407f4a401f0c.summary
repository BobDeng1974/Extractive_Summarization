the editor of the magazine embroiled in the scandal of feminist t - shirts being made by women paid just 62p an hour has dismissed the controversy as ‘ misogynistic ’			1
an investigation by @entity8 uncovered the shocking conditions in a factory making t - shirts bearing the slogan ‘ @entity14 ’ for a campaign by the @entity13 backed by @entity1			1
a union leader described the factory in @entity17 as a ‘ sweatshop ’ after the @entity20 report in november revealed that employees were sleeping 16 to a room			1
shocking : an investigation by @entity8 uncovered the conditions in a factory making t - shirts bearing the slogan ‘ @entity14 ’ ever since , those involved – including fashion retailer whistles – have repeatedly refused to concede that the workers ’ conditions were unacceptable or reveal the findings of their own investigation			1
the latest rebuttal came yesterday as @entity1 editor @entity36 claimed , ‘ this was not a sweatshop by any standard ’ – despite the cramped dormitories and employees being paid below the living wage			1
it has also emerged that the @entity13 – which works for women ’s rights – had reacted to the report by saying @entity8 ‘ is not a friend of women ’			1
mrs @entity36 told @entity48 that what bothered her most about the controversy was the inference that ‘ these silly women working on a magazine had n’t done their research			2
we are not responsible for the living wage in @entity17 , but this was not a sweatshop by any standard			0
’ apparently in reference to the furore over workers ’ conditions , mrs @entity36 added : ‘ the reaction was misogynistic , but that ’s what happens when you poke the bear			1
’ the t - shirts , which sold for £ 45 in @entity69 , had featured in @entity1 ’s ‘ feminism issue ’ and were worn by @entity72 deputy leader @entity71 in the @entity73 , along with @entity74 and @entity75 and actors including @entity77			1
last night a leading union official in @entity17 reacted with fury to mrs @entity36 ’s comments			1
@entity81 , who represents more than 36,000 workers , said : ‘ these factory workers have the worst possible conditions			2
they work long hours for low wages and are exploited			0
‘ i invite the magazine editor to come to see this factory and find out what a sweatshop looks like			2
' how would she like to sleep in a factory dormitory where you share your bedroom with 15 other people ? ' it ’s all very well her being given reassurances by the factory owner , but when you speak to the people who work there then you see the true extent of desperate poverty			0
’ mrs @entity81 said mrs @entity36 ’s implication that the wages were acceptable by @entity17 standards was wrong			1
‘ the magazine editor is mistaken because the textile workers do n’t even earn as much as the living wage			0
' they earn 6,000 rupees ( £ 120 ) a month , but a living wage is 14,685 rupees ( £ 300 ) , ’ she said			0
meanwhile , the @entity13 was criticised after the emergence of a blog posting by chairwoman @entity112 that was sent to people on its mailing list			0
she wrote : ‘ a well - intentioned project which was bringing much - needed attention to feminism from a younger audience and raising much - needed funds … then ran into trouble with @entity8 – not a friend of @entity123 or women in general			2
' but , you know , when newspapers like @entity8 go for us it means we are doing our job well			0
’ former vice-chairwoman of the @entity13 , @entity131 , said : ‘ it is outrageous that @entity112 has dismissed the investigation into female exploitation			1
‘ if it was n’t for @entity8 ’s exposé we would n’t have found out about the dire conditions these workers are facing			0
i wonder what the newspaper ’s female readership would make of her comments ? ’ last night mrs @entity112 could not be contacted for comment			0
in a further development , @entity144 , the @entity13 and @entity1 were accused of a ‘ cover - up ’ over their failure to deliver on a promised investigation into the factory after three months			1
after the @entity20 first broke the story , whistles and @entity1 released a joint statement to say the factory had already been ‘ ethically audited ’ and the women were being paid more than the minimum wage of about £ 87.50 a month			1
the audit has yet to be published			0
the @entity13 said the audit did not raise concerns about working conditions			0
following the @entity20 report , @entity144 pledged to inspect the @entity162 factory as ‘ a matter of urgency ’ , but it is refusing to comment on whether it has followed up on promises to send a ‘ senior member ’ to @entity17			2
all three have ignored repeated requests by the @entity20 over the past three months for an update on the investigation			0
@entity72 , a leading charity campaigning for textile workers ’ rights , called on @entity144 to be honest about the investigation			0
policy co-ordinator @entity175 said : ‘ by not being upfront and honest , @entity144 is denying justice to those people working in its factory			0
it smacks of a cover - up			2
’ asked about the accusation of a cover - up , ms @entity112 said : ‘ it ’s @entity144 who are conducting the investigation and i ’m afraid it ’s them who will have to provide an update			1
’ @entity144 spokeswoman @entity191 said : ‘ no comment at this end for you			0
’ a spokeswoman for @entity1 said : ‘ we have no further comment to make			2
