just over a month ago , @entity0 dialled @entity2 ’s mobile number , not the first to be quite unsure whether he was about to be deafened with a sonic boom of anger — or to be treated to ‘ @entity6 ’s ’ quick - witted and generous bonhomie			1
the programme director of @entity9 tv station @entity8 needed to make the peace			0
@entity2 had taken umbrage at the ‘ stupid question ’ of @entity8 front - man @entity13 in the aftermath of @entity16 ’s clinical 3 - 0 destruction of @entity17 in the @entity19 quarter - final first leg			1
‘ that ’s the tie over ? ’ @entity13 asked the notoriously volatile and edgy @entity17 manager			2
‘ how can i accept my salary this month if i stand here and say that ’s us out ? ’ @entity2 reasonably demanded			2
‘ it ’d be just as stupid of me to say we are definitely going to hammer them			0
i can stand here and give stupid answers to stupid questions but i ’m not going to any more , ’ @entity2 finished before calmly walking off			2
complex character : @entity17 's coach @entity2 did not hold any grudges against the tv station @entity0 discovered that @entity2 bore no malice			1
that he ’d ‘ forgotten ’ about the whole thing			0
two things emerged from the incident			0
@entity17 roasted @entity16 2 - 0 in the return leg , not taking the tie to extra time for the simple reason that @entity43 played miraculously well			2
secondly , that was the low point of a brutally testing season			0
the 3 - 0 defeat to a team which the previous season they ’d beaten twice , eliminated from the @entity19 semi-final and scored a grand total of eight goals against must have felt like the straw which crippled the camel			2
instead it was a point of inflection			0
they have rallied — winning 3 - 0 at @entity57 10 days later and qualifying for the @entity58 next saturday in @entity59 ... against @entity57			1
set against the backdrop of sudden disharmony in @entity62 ( @entity64 ’s methods under question , an inability to properly value a @entity68 title won in record time and a 4 - 0 home thrashing by @entity16 in the semi-final second leg ) @entity17 are already finishing their season with a more optimistic vibe than seemed possible at any time from september onwards , let alone after the 3 - 0 @entity16 rout			1
@entity2 admits : ‘ it ’s been a tremendously difficult season , since the beginning , full of extraordinary challenges and what is , in my experience , an unprecedented injury crisis			1
‘ but i ’ve always said that it ’s not necessary for us to be the “ best ” team in the world , just that we are capable of beating the “ best ” team in the world			0
’ his point is well made			0
of the 10 most - used @entity17 players in the @entity68 last term ( @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 ) only five feature in the top 10 this season			2
bad night : @entity103 helped @entity16 beat @entity17 3 - 0 of the others , @entity97 is gone ( to @entity57 ) , @entity98 has effectively missed the season , @entity95 and @entity100 have played fewer than 24 league games between them and mainstay central defender @entity108 , 41 matches last season , has played 16 times this			1
add to the mix that , in january , @entity92 confirmed he ’d be moving to @entity57 , too — and it ’s tough to imagine more hostile working conditions			0
saying his goodbyes : @entity92 will leave @entity17 this summer this time last year @entity2 was comparing @entity57 to ‘ a @entity129 villain ’ , in which case there were stages this season when @entity122 , licensed to lose his temper , was strapped to the lab table and @entity126 ’s laser was cutting up close to his nether regions			1
so , ahead of the big showdown with @entity131 next saturday , how has he coped ? shaken , but not stirred it seems			0
getting better : @entity17 have won more points than last season plenty to play for : @entity17 face @entity57 in the @entity58 final @entity17 have more points than last season , have conceded fewer @entity68 goals , came through the hardest @entity19 group ( @entity140 , @entity140 , @entity140 ) , earned around € 25million by reaching the quarter - finals , won the @entity142 that they lost to @entity57 last term and , if they regain the @entity58 ( from which the super-villains also eliminated them with a back - post goal from @entity146 and a toe - poke from @entity148 last season ) , there will be the double joy of pleasing the 80,000 yellow - and - black clad fanatics who are travelling to the @entity9 capital , ticket or no ticket , and ruining @entity57 ’s summer			1
should his @entity17 side inflict its third win of the season over @entity64 ’s @entity57 and lift the @entity58 in @entity59 then , who knows , @entity129 may be asked over to the ‘ dark ’ side in @entity62 this summer			1
uncomfortable to think of him saying ‘ yes ’ , is n’t it ? but then , you only live twice .			0

@entity2 aims to end @entity17 season on a high with @entity58 win over @entity57
@entity17 have won more points and conceded less goals than last season
