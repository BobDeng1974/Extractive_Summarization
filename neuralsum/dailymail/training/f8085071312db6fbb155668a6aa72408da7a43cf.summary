@entity0 always thought the manager of @entity2 should be @entity3			1
he said it privately , he said it publicly			0
he stated it very passionately one night in @entity7 , when the dwindling embers of the @entity10 era were being raked over following a @entity12 match			0
@entity0 was adamant , defiant , that @entity2 should resist the appeal of a foreign coach			1
in his eyes this meant giving @entity10 more time but it was plain that , even if a change had to be made , @entity0 felt the successor must hail from within these shores			1
it was what made @entity2 unique , he said			1
it was part of the culture of the club			2
a @entity3 manager affording opportunity to young @entity3 players			1
it was what set @entity2 apart			1
sunday , september 14 , 2014 , is the first day of the new @entity2			1
against @entity24 at @entity50 , a foreign coach will preside over a starting xi of mostly foreign , expensively - acquired , players			1
if there are @entity55 names on the team - sheet they will have been purchased for a king ’s ransom , just like the rest			2
if @entity60 or @entity61 does make the starting line - up , they will merely be keeping that seat warm until the injury list shortens or the next transfer window signals another round of improvements			2
the vow these days is to buy the equivalent of one @entity70 every year			0
@entity71 says @entity2 will continue giving youth its chance but , like @entity0 , he sounds like a man out of time			1
a project that intends to take a team from seventh place to automatic @entity12 qualification in one season is in too much of a hurry to rely on old - style youth development			2
new signings @entity83 and @entity85 ( right ) are both expected to face @entity24 on sunday ( from left ) @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity83 and @entity85 share a joke doubts remain about where @entity92 and @entity93 fit into @entity25 's team @entity2 celebrate their @entity12 success in 1999 , beating @entity97 in the final @entity25 ’s overhaul has cast out some ordinary players , but it can not help but scratch the odd gem , too : one of its first casualties would appear to be @entity92 , the rising star of the previous campaign , now pegged behind a who ’s who of world football			1
his starting opportunities would appear bleakly limited , short - term at least			2
it is n’t that @entity2 ’s spending spree is immoral — they ’ve got it , so why not flaunt it — or even that towards the end the purchases seemed to be based on what was available , rather than what was required			1
everyone agreed significant investment was needed			0
the class of 92 was a beautiful windfall , but @entity2 have not produced talent in any depth since then and waiting for the next generation would have seen the club slip further from the elite			1
@entity124 , the executive vice-chairman , took a big gamble , but a necessary one , the @entity126 having got away with reduced investment for so long			0
positively thinking , there is a genuine sense of anticipation and wonder around the team @entity134 will field tomorrow , the biggest buzz in @entity55 club football for several years			0
but is it @entity2 ? no. not the one @entity0 , @entity71 and many others thought they knew			1
not the @entity2 that sir @entity34 nurtured			2
@entity139 ( left ) , @entity140 ( right ) and their manager @entity35 hold the @entity12 aloft in 1968 @entity2 have yet to produce another batch of youngsters like their famous class of 92 ' @entity71 , @entity0 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 were stars for @entity2 @entity71 ( left , with @entity152 at training ) says @entity2 will always gives home - grown players a chance @entity0 has concerns about how the club he played for his entire career is being run now sir @entity34 applauds the @entity2 fans as he makes his way off the @entity50 pitch it is united as @entity163 , as @entity164 , as @entity165 or @entity166			1
it is @entity168 , the way every modern elite club , with one or two exceptions , is now a melting pot of star names and contracted performers , passing through as if on tour			0
@entity176 was an unforgettable force for good at @entity2 but , ultimately , his team was @entity165			2
@entity50 was a mutually beneficial stop on a career path that began at @entity181 and ended at the @entity182			0
@entity26 talks of staying at @entity2 for many years , but this is a vague notion also			1
he was ‘ eager to start the challenge ’ and ‘ very happy ’ at @entity184 , too , a year ago			0
‘ i have chosen this project , ’ he announced			0
now he has chosen another one			0
so this team may achieve great things , but it is not like the old days			0
one does not see @entity26 , @entity83 and @entity85 sinking their savings into @entity193 10 years from now			1
and with this new dynamic come changing attitudes , in the boardroom and also the cheap seats			0
no club ends up with the most expensively assembled squad in the @entity200 , and settles for life outside the @entity12 just three games into the season			1
@entity176 was a great player for @entity2 but his true love was @entity165 @entity150 said he had a special relationship with the @entity2 fans during his time at the club @entity71 is one of the only remaining links to the old @entity2 left at @entity50 @entity2 may be in 14th place now , but that is only seven points from the top and five behind the automatically qualified third - placed team , currently @entity215 , who nobody thinks will be there come the end of the season			1
there are 105 points up for grabs from here , including home and away fixtures against every current @entity200 club that has ever qualified for the @entity12 in its modern format			1
with the names on their roster , @entity2 ’s owners now have every reason to expect to make the top three this season			2
and that is a sign of shifting times , too			0
@entity10 would undoubtedly have been given a longer run , if only his first season had not been such a disaster			0
@entity134 ’s reputation may buy him indulgence , but there will also be irritation if he does not turn this ship around , and fast			0
the board will not see the mitigation of a squad brought together in haste and on the hoof ; they will see numbers , big numbers , and with them comes a demand for results			0
@entity253 is one of the young players that @entity25 has given a chance this season striker @entity256 is seen as a player who could break into the @entity2 first team in the future at @entity50 , too , there may be an unfamiliar atmosphere			1
the majority of @entity2 fans were steadfastly supportive of @entity10 even when they knew his regime was damaged beyond repair			2
there will be a huge sense of excitement around tomorrow ’s game — but what if the change in fortunes is slow to unfold ? not against @entity24 , now viewed more as cannon fodder than tomorrow ’s opposition , but against @entity164 on october 26 , @entity163 on november 2 or @entity275 on november 22 ? the club that @entity0 and @entity71 knew enjoyed a special relationship with its home - produced players			1
@entity150 summed it up last week			0
‘ when you are a young player at @entity2 , when you are there from a young age and are home - grown , you feel it from the fans , ’ he said			1
# ‘ you have a really special bond and association with them			0
when we were successful , when we were winning @entity292 cups , leagues and @entity294 , it felt really personal from the fans , like how i feel when i see my son score a goal , or how my parents felt when they saw me win a championship			0
you feel like you have 75,000 parents watching you in the stands			0
that ’s how @entity2 have always been			2
’ @entity305 ( centre ) was sold by @entity2 to @entity215 during the january transfer window @entity308 ( centre ) surprisingly moved from @entity2 to @entity275 for £ 16m so while the new signings are not exactly orphans — @entity176 was loyally supported , too , after the 2006 @entity312 — they will not be as tenderly indulged through the difficult times			1
it was easy to support @entity176			0
he was a budding genius , and an important part of a very successful team			0
yet what of a striker earning in the region of £ 300,000 who is not performing , in a team that has failed to click ? even @entity323 , with @entity2 from the age of 11 , spoke of the oppressive tension around the club last season			1
what if this continues ? will @entity26 feel he has 75,000 parents too ? or will he be like @entity330 at @entity275 , or @entity331 at @entity164 , judged in relation to his transfer fee , salary and performance ? @entity336 gets an easier ride than @entity330 ever will , for the reasons @entity150 identified			2
so this is it for @entity2			2
day one of a new era			0
the club @entity341 thought he knew no longer exists			0
@entity2 will look the same and sound the same tomorrow — they may even play the same if @entity134 can overcome the time - poor restrictions of the international break to restore some of the old swagger			1
yet they are not the same			0
@entity2 are like the rest from here : only richer , grander and with great , great expectations .			2

@entity2 have prided themselves on having @entity3 managers and players
this summer has seen the club adopt a different *policy* by hiring @entity25 and signing the likes of @entity26 and @entity83
home - grown @entity308 has been sold , while @entity323 has gone on loan to @entity215 with his contract up in the summer
@entity2 's *approach* has been *criticised* by former player @entity0
assistant boss @entity71 insists club will give home - grown stars a chance
@entity2 are preparing to face @entity24 in the @entity200 on sunday
