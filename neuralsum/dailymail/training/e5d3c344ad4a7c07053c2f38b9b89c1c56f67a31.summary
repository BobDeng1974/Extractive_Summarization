opinion : @entity1 caused a @entity3 storm with a tweet about @entity6 sniper @entity8 actors continue to fire @entity3 salvos at each other over actor @entity1 ’s controversial tweet about movie @entity5 , based on @entity15 @entity14 ’s experiences in @entity16			1
he wrote that the movie reminded him of a @entity19 propaganda film about a sniper that appeared in @entity23 ’s acclaimed @entity22			1
such is the furore surrounding the tweet that he felt obliged to further clarify his comments with another tweet underlining that he has nothing against war veterans and was not comparing the movie to @entity19 propaganda			1
now @entity32 has leapt to the defence of the @entity35 actor , after @entity36 weighed in with a tweet claiming that he had no right to make the comment in the original tweet because he ’d never fought in a war			1
@entity36 , known for his role as @entity43 , wrote : ‘ @entity1 ... i like your films , but right now , i wan na kick your ass			1
’ however , @entity32 retorted : ‘ did @ @entity50 threaten @entity1 ? and is n't that the same kind of troubled thinking that got @entity14 killed ? ’ the @entity54 film is a profile of @entity14 , who was described as the most lethal sniper in @entity6 military history			1
while critical reviews have been generally positive and the movie has been nominated for @entity61 for @entity62 and @entity63 , it has also drawn fire for being jingoistic or propaganda for the @entity6 military			1
filmmaker @entity67 caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were ' cowards ' since his uncle died by a @entity72 sniper shot in @entity73 taking to @entity3 in rage , the fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed : ' my uncle killed by sniper in @entity73			1
we were taught snipers were cowards			2
will shoot u in the back			0
' @entity67 later backtracked those comments on @entity85 , writing that he thought the film was well made but could have done a better job at contextualizing the @entity88			1
@entity1 has now also sought to calm the @entity3 storm down with another explanation of his tweet sent on january 19 that referenced the @entity19 sniper			1
he wrote : ‘ it appears i need to further clarify a tweet i sent a few days ago			1
i said a sniper movie kind of reminded me of a scene in another movie that involved a sniper movie			2
i did n't compare the two at all			0
i merely said that one kind of reminded me of the other , because they both involved plots about the most lethal of snipers			2
he used apples and oranges as an example ‘ people then claimed that i compared the movie @entity5 to @entity19 propaganda , something i would never do ( i 've already publicly explained that i enjoyed @entity5 ) and also implied that i somehow have something against @entity14 and veterans in general , neither of which are true in the least			2
‘ my grandfather was a veteran			0
my comment about the movie was not meant to have any political implications			0
any political meaning was ascribed to my comment by news commentary			0
i 'm sorry if this somehow offended anyone , but that was not my intention			0
i hope this clears things up			0
’ this follows an earlier attempt at clarification			0
@entity1 insisted on that occasion as well that he was n't comparing @entity5 with the parody vignette in @entity22 , but was saying that one reminded him of the other			1
he tweeted : ‘ apples remind me of oranges			0
ca n't compare them though			0
' @entity1 , 32 , then threw in a small dig at the media , accusing the press of blowing his opinions ' out of proportion '			2
the interview star wrote that he is happy to keep the fires burning on the controversy			2
@entity23 's @entity156 culminates with an assassination attempt on @entity158 at the premiere of a fictional propaganda film called ' @entity161 ' which translates to @entity22			2
one of the characters of the film is a haughty @entity165 soldier who plays himself in @entity22 , a movie about how he killed 200 @entity167 soldiers from a clock tower in one battle			2
controversy : @entity1 said @entity6 sniper ( still on the right ) reminded him of @entity22 ( still on the left ) , a fake @entity19 propaganda film from @entity23 's @entity73 film @entity22 true story : @entity5 is based on @entity14 's memoir , which was written before his tragic death in february 2013 at a shooting range @entity61 - tipped : @entity54 's ( left ) movie is hotly - tipped to pick up a few @entity61 , including @entity63 for @entity180 ( right ) @entity5 on the other hand stars @entity180 as @entity14 , the real - life man who became the deadliest sniper in @entity6 military history , saving hundreds of @entity6 lives with at least 160 kills			1
the film , based on @entity14 's memoir , ends with his tragic death in @entity190 , allegedly at the hands of a fellow soldier with @entity193 he was trying to help			0
kid rock was one of the first stars to wade in on the debate stirred up by @entity1 and @entity67 , tweeting : ‘ : ' f — you @entity67 , you ’re a piece of s — and your uncle would be ashamed of you			1
@entity1 , your uncle probably molested you			0
i hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon			0
' @entity205 bless you @entity14 , thank you for your service			0
' @entity5 , directed by @entity54 , raked in $ 105.3million during its opening weekend in @entity6 .			0
