@entity1 star @entity0 has revealed how friends distanced themselves and ' abandoned ' her after learning of her battle with depression			2
the actress , who plays @entity6 on the @entity8 soap , said people battling mental illness should be encouraged to share their fears with those close to them			1
the 57 - year - old , who has fought depression and attempted suicide in the past , told @entity17 it was easy for sufferers to feel isolated and alone			1
' i had one person say to me , and we 'd been friends for a long time , " i do n't think we should see each for a while because you 're not yourself and you 're not good for me " , ' she said			0
the 57 - year - old has battled depression for years , and has attempted suicide ' we actually got way beyond that , but at that time i felt abandoned by lots of people - and i think many people do			1
' @entity0 said she believes the stigma attached to mental health issues can prevent people discussing their problems with family and friends			1
she said : ' we say to someone " how are you ? " but more often than not we actually do n't wait for the answer			0
' if you just get the feeling that someone you know is suffering is sad say , " how are you ? do you want to talk about it ? " ' and if you are the person being asked that question , try to talk about it			2
' the actress spoke out as a new survey revealed almost 60 per cent of people with mental health problems wait more than a year to tell the people closest to them			1
the survey , carried out by campaign group @entity62 , also found 64 per cent of respondents believe the stigma and discrimination they experienced was as bad as or worse than the mental health problem itself			1
the group is calling for people to ' break the silence ' surrounding mental health problems and to spend five minutes today discussing the subject			1
@entity73 , director of @entity62 , said : ' it 's shocking to see that so many people are still waiting over a year to talk to their nearest and dearest - it 's hard to imagine this happening with other health issues			1
the actress , who plays @entity6 on the @entity8 soap , said people should be encouraged to talk to those closest to them when dealing with mental health issues ' we know that talking openly about mental health is a vital first step towards breaking down stigma and discrimination , so we are asking people to take five minutes on february 5 to do just that			1
' with major employers , politicians , universities , schools and tens of thousands of individuals taking part , we 've come a long way towards breaking the silence			0
' but this new data shows there is still much further to go until talking about mental health is an ordinary and unremarkable thing to do			1
' @entity0 , who was forced to take five months off from @entity1 in 2009 after checking into @entity104 for depression , spoke in 2013 of how her mental health problems had affected her work			1
' i think some people see you as unreliable and flaky and that you might not be able to do your job as well as you could , ' she told the @entity112			2
' and i was very aware that some people at @entity114 felt like that about me at the time			2
i did n't want to be talked about like that because , if i take something on , i usually finish it to the very end and do the best that i can			0
' in 2007 , @entity0 revealed how five years after a hysterectomy in march 1991 - carried out as treatment for cancer - she began to feel ' life was a battle ' and dreaded going to work			2
after a year of increasing despair , the day came where she broke down on set			1
@entity0 , pictured with her on - screen ex-husband @entity129 , played by @entity130 , spoke out as the campaign group @entity62 launched a campaign encouraging people to talk about mental health issues for five minutes a day ' the pretence was over			1
my heart was beating fast , i was sweating - i did n't have a shread of self - esteem			2
' it was then that the @entity8 doctor diagnosed the actress with depression			2
' i was shaking and felt numb , ' she said in an interview			0
' when he said i had clinical depression it was a surprise			0
i never thought that i would suffer depression			0
' fifteen months later , @entity0 collapsed at home and was admitted to @entity104			0
then , two years after her first diagnosis , she learned the problem was actually her ovaries			0
they were no longer producing enough oestrogen - a hormone that affects mood and cognition			0
she was prescribed the antidepressant @entity156 along with the oestrogen supplement @entity158 , and a testosterone supplement @entity160			0
slowly , she began to have days when she felt less miserable			0
