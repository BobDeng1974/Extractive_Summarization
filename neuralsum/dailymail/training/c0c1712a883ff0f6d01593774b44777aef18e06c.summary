sex therapist dr. @entity0 has just turned 100 years old , and the bedroom - related issues she treats today are markedly different from those she did when she started out in the @entity4			1
' the biggest problem now is a lack of desire , ' she tells @entity8			0
' and i ’m shocked at the lack of connection between people because of @entity13 - even though i love my @entity13 ! there is so much less of actual physical connection			2
' dr. @entity0 , who still practices in @entity17 , adds : ' you have to look at your priorities			1
we need touching to make us feel wanted and loved			0
that ’s lacking so much in this generation			0
lack of looking , lack of touching , lack of smiling			0
i do n’t get it			0
i do n’t get how people are n’t missing that , and do n’t seem to think they are			0
' the biggest problem now is a lack of desire , ' she says , blaming our busy lives and our @entity13 fixations dr. @entity0 was born at the start of @entity41 and graduated from @entity42 in 1934 , in the same class as revolutionary chef @entity44 , no less			1
her gynecologist husband performed one of the first legal abortions in @entity17			0
she started working as a sex therapist at a time when a sudden need sprung forth - just as the birth control pill was legalized			2
back then , she says , sex was a good deal more ' frantic ' than it is today			2
she recalls the race to see and feel everything , because sex was no longer just about having babies , it was about ' pleasure			2
' back then , a lot of women came to dr. @entity0 because they found they could n't reach orgasm , for which she generally prescribed exploratory masturbation			1
' lack of looking , lack of touching , lack of smiling ... i do n’t get how people are n’t missing that , and do n’t seem to think they are ' these days , however , she sees a lot of people for whom masturbation is actually the cause of sexual problems ; particularly men , and particularly as a result of the internet porn explosion			2
' i see that a lot in some single men who do n’t make the effort to go out in the world to face the issues , face the possible rejection , ' she remarks			1
' they satisfy their sexual needs sitting in front of the computer and masturbating			0
' a generation of porn - addicts : a lot of dr @entity0 's male patients today do n't get out into the ' real world ' to risk facing rejection			1
' they satisfy their sexual needs sitting in front of the computer and masturbating , ' she says on the cultural transition of ' casual sex ' from the @entity4 to now , she points to the @entity100 crisis of the @entity101 as one of the factors which slowed us down and encouraged a more measured approach to sex			1
but do we now make love too little ? dr. @entity0 claims that between the rat race of our busy careers and our non-stop push for attaining ' more ' on every level , we are often literally too ' exhausted ' to get it on with our partners			1
still , she may specialize in sex - or the lack thereof - but dr @entity0 maintains that at the end of the day , no matter what generation we live in , our bedroom antics do n't trump all			1
' sexual pleasure is just one part of what men and women want from each other , ' she states			0
' they want intimacy , they want closeness , they want understanding , they want fun , and they want someone who really cares about them beyond just going to bed with them			0

dr. @entity0 has been practicing since the @entity4 , when sex was ' frantic '
she claims *modern* men watch porn rather than face real - life *‘* rejection ’ and that we *'re* all too ' exhausted ' to get it on
