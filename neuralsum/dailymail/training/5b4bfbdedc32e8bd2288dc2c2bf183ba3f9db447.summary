the striker said after the match that the action was a tribute to his friend , @entity22 comedian @entity21 , and insisted that he did not mean to cause any offence			1
a statement from @entity7 on monday read : ' @entity3 was asked to explain his goal celebration by caretaker head coach @entity26 within minutes of the game finishing at @entity9			1
' @entity3 said that he performed the gesture to dedicate his goal to a friend and vehemently denied having any intention to cause offence			1
' upon reporting for training this morning , @entity3 was asked by sporting and technical director @entity34 to give a full explanation about his goal celebration , during which he again strongly denied intending to cause offence			1
investigation : the @entity38 is continuing its investigation into the seriousness of @entity3 's goal celebration bittersweet : @entity3 performed the salute after scoring the first of two goals in a 3 - 3 draw with @entity9 read the match report from @entity47 here ' the club fully acknowledge that @entity3 ' goal celebration has caused offence in some quarters and has asked @entity3 not to perform the gesture again			1
@entity3 immediately agreed to adhere to this request			2
' the club is aware that the @entity38 is investigating the matter and has offered its full cooperation			2
the club will continue to make its own enquiries - a process which will remain confidential between the club and @entity3			1
' @entity3 is eligible for matches whilst the @entity38 carries out its investigation			1
therefore @entity3 will remain under consideration for first team selection whilst the @entity38 and the club continue their enquiries			1
' @entity26 added : ' @entity68 has trained normally			0
he has been out there on monday and trained like he did last week			0
' he has made the comment in terms of the situation			0
he did n't mean to offend anyone			0
that 's all we can say			0
' it would have been nice to have talked about his performance but there is a distraction to it and we will have to find out on tuesday how it all is			0
' when asked if the row had taken the shine off his spell in charge , @entity26 said : ' i would like to have concentrated on the football , it has been a real examination for the football club - including myself and the players			0
friends : @entity7 acting head coach @entity26 says that the gesture was a dedication from @entity3 ( right ) to his @entity22 comedian friend @entity21 ( left ) , which @entity3 reiterated on @entity96 doubling up : @entity3 ( left ) is on the spot to score @entity7 's second goal of the afternoon @entity99 the @entity101 defender was pictured twice doing the gesture , once with @entity21 , lastmonth			1
but he later said he did not know what it meant and had been ‘ tricked ’			0
@entity105 the @entity106 forward tweeted a picture of @entity3 ’s celebration and wrote : ‘ @entity3 is a legend i love him is a best french striker ’ and included a message of support for @entity21			1
' we have come through a very difficult period after the shock news of the manager going and the players have responded positively			0
' @entity3 faces a minimum five - match ban from the @entity38			1
he is set to become the first player sanctioned under rules brought in by @entity122 football ’s governing body in may to combat racist behaviour			0
the @entity124 have called for police involvement and for @entity3 to receive the same punishment that would be handed down for a @entity16 salute			1
on sunday night the @entity128 said it takes all allegations of hate crime seriously and will consider whether action is required			0
the @entity38 are consulting anti-racism campaigners @entity132 and @entity134 community groups			2
the new guidelines mean that @entity3 , if found guilty , can receive at least five matches and it could be ‘ significantly ’ longer			2
no timescale has been placed on when a decision will be reached			0
it is not a fast - track case and could take some time due to the sensitivities and seriousness of the allegations			0
@entity3 , 34 , a practising @entity146 , is said to be astonished at the controversy and tweeted that he was only giving a ‘ special dedication ’ to his comedian friend @entity148 , who regularly uses the gesture on stage			1
@entity21 has convictions for spreading race hate , and last week interior minister @entity154 announced that ‘ all legal means ’ to ban @entity21 from making public appearances were being considered , saying : ‘ he attacks the memory of @entity159 victims in an obvious and unbearable way			0
’ controversial : this picture of @entity162 ( left ) apparently performing the ' quenelle ' was on social media sites @entity21 and his supporters claim it is merely an @entity167 , anti-establishment signal and the 47 - year - old has threatened to sue those suggesting otherwise			0
the gesture has gone viral on social media and two soldiers were sanctioned by the @entity22 army in september for performing it in uniform in front of a @entity178 synagogue			1
a @entity180 page in support of the pair published a picture in november of @entity162 apparently performing the gesture outside @entity186 's training ground			0
the picture was republished on @entity96 the day after @entity3 's celebration at @entity47 but @entity189 understands @entity162 was unaware of the anti-semitic or political connotations surrounding the gesture			1
support : @entity194 defender @entity193 tweeted a message to @entity3 after his celebration he is believed to have performed the act because of its popularity among people in @entity22			1
he is also believed to know nothing about the controversy surrounding it			0
and @entity194 defender @entity193 was on @entity96 supporting @entity3 after the @entity9 game			1
the message is difficult to translate as it is in @entity22 text speak but it is close to ' i congratulate you on the beautiful @entity208			2
' @entity3 was also on @entity96 on sunday night to insist that his gesture had no religious or anti-semitic connection			1
he wrote : ‘ meaning of quenelle : anti-system			0
i do not know what the word religion has to do with this story ! ’ fooled : @entity101 defender @entity99 ( right ) was pictured making the same gesture as @entity3 but later claimed he was tricked into doing it ‘ the quenelle is a dedication to @entity220			1
with regard to the ministers who give their own interpretations they are the ones who create the confusion and controversy without knowing what the gesture really means ! i shall therefore ask the people not to be duped by the media			2
and of course , i am neither anti-semitic nor racist			0
’ @entity21 applauded @entity3 in a post on his @entity180 page			2
‘ excellent live quenelle by @entity3 , ’ he wrote			2
‘ thanks for the support			0
’ but @entity3 ’s actions were roundly criticised elsewhere			2
@entity239 , the @entity22 sports minister , said : ‘ @entity3 ’s gesture is a shocking , disgusting provocation			1
there is no place for anti-semitism and incitement to hatred on the football pitch			0

it is not worth arguing about interpretation			0
we must be clear about our values			0
’ @entity124 president dr @entity259 wants @entity3 dealt with as if he ‘ had made the infamous outstretched arm salute ’ of the @entity261			1
‘ it is sickening that such a well - known footballer would make such an abusive and hateful gesture in front of tens of thousands of spectators			2
we expect that the @entity269 officials as well as the police will give @entity3 the appropriate punishment			2
’ political protest : a man poses with a drawing showing a @entity134 character covering the mouth of an other character with a gag reading ' freedom of speech ' during a protest in support of @entity21 defiant : a group performs the ' quenelle ' salutes in front of the theatre @entity21 's performing at a lengthy ban for @entity3 may signal the end of his career , with rumours of his retirement already emerging earlier this season			2
@entity106 forward @entity105 tweeted a picture of @entity3 ’s celebration and called him a ‘ legend ’ while expressing support for @entity21			2
other footballers have been pictured making the gesture , including @entity99 last month			0
but the @entity101 defender later said he had been tricked			0
when @entity7 striker @entity3 scored the first of his two goals in saturday 's 3 - 3 @entity269 draw at @entity9 , he celebrated by making a gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of @entity122 football			1
but the salute , known in @entity22 as ' la quenelle ' , is the subject of a fierce national debate that has reached the @entity22 interior ministry and stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across @entity3 's homeland			1
