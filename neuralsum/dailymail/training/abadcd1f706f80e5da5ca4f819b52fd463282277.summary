@entity0 has come under fire for making public @entity3 's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of @entity6 's @entity5 qualifier with @entity7			1
the @entity9 star told the @entity6 manager that he was too fatigued to start the match in @entity12 after shouldering a heavy burden this season for both club and country			1
@entity0 then made @entity3 's comments public ahead of the match , which @entity6 won 1 - 0 thanks to @entity21 's second - half free - kick			1
@entity31 pundits and former @entity9 players @entity33 and @entity34 both criticised @entity0 for not keeping their conversation private			1
@entity33 said : ' i would never have dreamed of saying that [ i 'm too tired ] to an @entity6 manager , but then i picked up a lot of injuries			1
' i 'm sure @entity40 would have been leaning on him , [ saying ] you need a break and this is an opportunity to get one			0
' why on earth did @entity0 say it though ? @entity48 is not the best policy			2
why has @entity0 got into this ? he could have said ' i want to freshen this up			2
' this would n't even be a conversation			0
' @entity31 pundit @entity33 said @entity0 should have kept the conversation with @entity3 private @entity34 , also talking on @entity31 , agreed that @entity0 should have used more discretion @entity34 agreed that discretion would have been a better idea : ' me as a player , i would never give a manager a chance to leave me out			1
' but keep it between yourselves , just come out and say @entity27 played well last game and say @entity3 needs a rest			1
but now we are having a debate on it			0
' @entity0 could have been more careful , but i do n't think @entity40 would have been involved			2
' @entity3 , 19 , came off the bench to win the 74th - minute free - kick that led to @entity6 skipper @entity21 curled in for his 43rd international goal			1
@entity0 said after the game : ' people do n't like it when you simplistically tell the truth			2
we were training at @entity79 doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically			0
@entity0 chats to @entity3 during training on the eve of the match in @entity12 , which @entity6 won 1 - 0 @entity3 's @entity9 teammate @entity27 started in his place in the @entity6 midfield diamond ' just before we started , @entity3 had done the warm up and he came to me and said '' look i really am feeling a bit tired , i 'm not in my best form at the moment because i am feeling a bit tired ''			1
' so i said best thing is @entity27 starts the game and you rest and i have got you to bring on from the bench , simple as that			0
' as you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he is n't suffering from anything			0
' it was a question of having two players , who both did pretty well against @entity105 and one is telling me he is a bit tired and jaded , the other one is full of beans			0
' we 'll put the one on who is full of beans and keep the other one up your sleeve			0
' i think it would be wrong of players to try to fool me into think they are ready and that they 're 100 per cent when they are n't because they are robbing somebody else of an opportunity			0
i thought @entity27 had a good game			0

@entity0 revealed that @entity3 had told him he was feeling fatigued prior to @entity6 's @entity5 qualifier with @entity7
@entity3 was dropped from the starting line - up in place of @entity27
the @entity9 man later came on as a substitute as @entity6 won 1 - 0
@entity0 was criticised by @entity31 pundits @entity33 and @entity34 for making @entity3 's admission of tiredness public
@entity21 's free - kick preserved @entity6 's *perfect* start to qualifying
