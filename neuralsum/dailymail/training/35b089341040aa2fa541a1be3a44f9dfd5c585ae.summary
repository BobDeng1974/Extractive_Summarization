with her golden tan , plumped breasts and lips and bleach blonde hair extensions it would be easy to mistake 28 - year - old @entity7 star @entity6			1
and that 's exactly what the @entity10 lookalike is hoping for , having spent £ 20,000 on surgery and cosmetic procedures to emulate her favourite celebrity			1
@entity15 , who dubs herself ' @entity16 ' is now a professional lookalike , posing as the @entity19 actress in personal appearances and at events around @entity10			1
but the petite blonde wants one more procedure to complete the transformation : @entity6 's barbed wire tattoo			1
the best : @entity15 says she 's also an improvement on the original by virtue of being from @entity10 model @entity15 , from @entity29 in @entity30 , has been obsessed with the buxom star since childhood and has put herself at risk numerous times in her quest to become a body double for 46 - year - old @entity6			1
as well as getting @entity37 , lip fillers , teeth whitening and false eyelashes applied she regularly injects herself with @entity42 , an unregulated tanning drug , and has been using sunbeds since the tender age of 10 - years - old , now spending up to 15 hours a week in her father 's sunbed shop			1
following a chest augmentation in 2004 she has twice suffered with exploding breasts as her dd implants burst under sunbed lamps			2
the model needed seven operations to repair the damage but that has n't stopped her pursuing her idea of @entity6 perfection			2
@entity15 , who changed her name to @entity6 by @entity59 in 2009 , told @entity60 : ' i ’ll admit it – i ’m hooked			2
i ’m what they call a tanorexic			0
but i could n’t live without a tan – it ’s a part of who i am			0
and i would n’t leave the house without one			0
@entity16 : @entity15 uses her blonde bombshell looks to help her in her career as a @entity6 impersonator ' i used to watch @entity72 growing up and thought she was beautiful			1
i was delighted to think i looked like her			0
i became a bit obsessed with her in my teens and rewatched all the @entity7 shows			0
i just think she ’s great			0
' any woman can have big breasts and blonde hair but she ’s captured everyone ’s attention for decades			2
it ’s more than looks – she has charisma and intrigues people			0
that ’s what i love and want to emulate			0
' mother - of - two @entity6 had a barbed wire tattoo inked on her bicep as part of her role in the 1996 @entity94 sci - fi film			1
now super fan @entity15 is planning on getting a carbon copy of the etching , telling the @entity97 : ' it 's an iconic image that everyone associates with @entity6			1
' i actually really like the tattoo			2
' @entity15 is signed to @entity101			0
she is tweeting @ @entity102 the resemblance is clear in this picture of @entity15 as a teenager before all the surgery carolyn as she appears now			0
she started dying her hair blonde when she was just 12 - years - old on the job : @entity15 in her @entity6 get - up during a paid appearance at a party @entity6 shows off her barbed wire tattoo at the 1996 @entity113			1

@entity115 , 28 , from @entity10 is dubbed the @entity16
