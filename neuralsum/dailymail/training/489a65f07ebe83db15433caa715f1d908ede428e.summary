an @entity1 official has said reaching a deal with the @entity3 over its nuclear programme by tomorrow is ' impossible '			1
the official said the discussion may soon have to shift from trying to reach an agreement to extending negotiations past tomorrow 's deadline for the end of this round of negotiations			1
western powers had hoped the talks in @entity15 could open the door to ending economic sanctions on @entity1 , an energy - rich nation of 76million people , after decades of hostility with the @entity3			2
@entity1 foreign minister @entity21 , front left , former @entity24 foreign policy chief @entity23 , rear second left , and @entity27 secretary of state @entity26 , right , wait for the start nuclear talks in @entity15 but sources have now confirmed what officials close to the talks have been predicting privately for weeks : that a final deal is still too far off to hammer out by the deadline			1
' considering the short time left until the deadline and number of issues that needed to be discussed and resolved , it is impossible to reach a final and comprehensive deal by nov. 24 , ' @entity1 's @entity36 news agency quoted an unidentified member of the country 's negotiating team in @entity15 as saying			1
' the issue of extension of the talks is an option on the table and we will start discussing it if no deal is reached by sunday night , ' the official said			2
a @entity56 official who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity said : ' to reach a comprehensive deal seems physically impossible			0
even if we were to get a political agreement the technical annexes are not ready			0
' a @entity56 source said on saturday there was no decision yet on extending the talks : ' it 's the ministers ' decision , but talks on an extension could begin sunday or monday , ' he said			2
@entity1 and @entity72 diplomats close to the negotiations have been telling @entity74 for weeks the two sides remained deadlocked on the key issues of @entity1 's uranium enrichment capacity and the pace of lifting sanctions			1
the @entity1 official quoted by @entity36 said the sides ' were trying to reach a framework accord on major issues like ... the number of centrifuges , enrichment capacity and the timeframe of lifting sanctions			1
' the @entity27 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 began the final round of talks with @entity1 on tuesday to clinch a pact under which @entity97 would curb its nuclear work in exchange for lifting economic sanctions			2
' the meeting between @entity21 , @entity26 and @entity103 was good , ' an unidentified @entity1 official was quoted as saying by another @entity1 news agency , @entity104			1
' however , we still have a lot to work on and it is too early for the final judgement			0
' national pride : @entity1 students hold placards to show their support for @entity1 's nuclear program in a gathering in front of the headquarters of @entity1 's @entity117 in @entity97 ' we do n't accept any limitation ' : another student holds a placard to show a support for the nuclear program the talks aim to end @entity72 suspicions that @entity1 is seeking an atomic bomb capability , while allowing @entity1 to have the civilian nuclear programme it says is its right under international treaties			1
in a breakthrough preliminary deal reached a year ago , the @entity27 and @entity24 agreed to ease some sanctions on @entity1 while @entity97 agreed to some curbs on its nuclear programmes			1
but a final deal has proved elusive			0
sanctions , tightened sharply since 2010 , are inflicting severe damage to @entity1 's economy , while the @entity27 and its ally @entity137 have said they reserve the right to use force to destroy any @entity1 nuclear bomb programme			1
@entity142 would also have to win acceptance from regional allies @entity137 , which already has nuclear weapons , and @entity146 , both avowed enemies of @entity1			2
@entity26 briefed @entity137 prime minister @entity148 by phone on saturday and @entity146 's foreign minister @entity150 in person at the @entity15 airport today			0
' @entity1 must not be allowed to set itself up as a nuclear threshold state , ' mr @entity148 said about his conversation			2
' there is no reason for it to retain thousands of centrifuges which would allow it to enrich uranium for a nuclear bomb in a short period of time			0
' officials say an extension of the talks could last from several weeks to several months			0
neither side wants negotiations to collapse , but @entity72 officials are afraid extending talks again could make it harder to get a final deal			0
a section of the @entity172 : @entity1 's nuclear programme first began in the 1950s with the help of the @entity27 @entity1 's secret nuclear programme was revealed in 2002 , when an opposition group leaked details of a uranium enrichment plant at @entity180 and a heavy - water reactor at @entity182			1
the government subsequently agreed to inspections by the @entity185 ( @entity185 ) , but the watchdog ruled it was unable to confirm @entity1 's claims that its nuclear programme was for purely civilian purposes			1
enriched uranium can be used for civilian purposes , but if the concentration of the active uranium isotope is 90 per cent or above it can also be used to build nuclear bombs			0
and a by - product of the nuclear process in heavy water reactors is plutonium , another material useful for making an atom bomb			0
ironically enough , @entity1 's first nuclear programme was launched with aid from the @entity27 in the 1950s as part of the @entity205 programme			1
it was severely hampered after the @entity206 when international cooperation from @entity72 nuclear powers was all but withdrawn			0
at the same time the first @entity209 , @entity210 , disbanded a clandestine research programme because he considered it forbidden under @entity213 ethics			0
throughout the 80s and 90s @entity1 's nuclear programme operated in fits and starts with help from @entity217 , @entity93 , @entity218 and @entity92 , but continuing opposition from the @entity27 @entity185 officials visited @entity1 nuclear sites and reported that all their observations were consistent with peaceful use of atomic energy			1
nevertheless , rumours persisted that the @entity227 was seeking to build an atom bomb , suspicions which came to a head when the secret enrichment plant was publicly revealed in 2002			0
since then , at the instigation of the @entity185 and @entity72 powers , the @entity232 has passed eight resolutions on @entity1 , demanding it suspend its uranium enrichment activities			1
the @entity185 has consistently stated it is unable to conclude that @entity1 's nuclear program is entirely peaceful			1
although the @entity1 airforce is a hotch potch of various aircraft from all over the world , including the @entity27 , it is not known to have any strategic - type bombers			2
however the country has a number of ballistic missiles in service and in development , as well as a space programme that , in a similar way to the @entity27 - @entity92 @entity252 space race , could provide it with dual - use rocket technologies			0
the @entity255 and 3 missiles currently operational have a range of up to 2,000km with payloads of 1,200kg and 990kg respectively , making them potent enough to strike @entity137 and other regional rivals such as @entity146			0
@entity1 also has 12 @entity260 long range cruise missiles purchased without nuclear warheads from @entity262 in 2001			2
they can fly up to 3,000km to their targets			0
the country 's most advanced missile , the @entity265 , has an unknown range but is estimated to be 2,500 km. the missile is radar evading and can strike targets simultaneously using multiple warheads , but has a payload of only 800kg .			0
