by @entity0 published : 12:46 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 13:25 est , 13 may 2013 it is every new parent 's worry that their child might be born with a serious medical condition			1
but 6,000 @entity8 parents each year are dealt the double blow of being told their child is not only very ill , but that doctors are limited in what they can do to help because they do not know what the problem is			1
this is the plight of families affected by @entity16			0
six - year - old @entity17 is one of the 40 per cent of disabled children in the @entity19 who suffer with what doctors have termed as @entity22 ( @entity23 ) @entity23 is not a condition or a diagnosis and it does not refer to one specific syndrome or condition			1
it is used as an umbrella term to describe all those conditions that medical experts do not understand			2
it is though that around 40 per cent of disabled children in the @entity19 suffer with @entity23			1
many @entity23 children remain undiagnosed because it is highly likely that they have a very rare syndrome or condition			1
at six years old , @entity17 has only just reached the milestone of being able to sit up unsupported			1
he still can not walk , talk or feed himself			1
yet doctors are entirely unable to explain what is causing his assortment of seemingly unrelated symptoms			2
he has undergone a barrage of tests and not one has suggested that there is anything wrong with him			0
however , he is profoundly disabled , unable to speak or stand , and has to be fed through a tube directly into his stomach			1
for the first few months of @entity17 ’s life his parents @entity50 , 39 , and her husband , @entity51 , believed their son had nothing more than clubfoot			2
however , at nine months old , a health visitor noticed that he was not able to sit up unsupported so referred him to a specialist for tests			0
he was seen by physiotherapists and underwent a range of genetic tests but all of them came back normal			0
mrs @entity64 said : ‘ as soon as we took him to the hospital they realised there was something severely wrong			0
‘ however , they never had any idea what was wrong with him			0
@entity17 's mother @entity50 says that despite his serious disabilities he brings a huge amount of joy to the family and that he is full of energy and always laughing ‘ nobody ever even suggested what it could be			2
all we know is that it is probably something genetic			0
’ she added : ‘ we have now run out of things to test for			0
’ @entity17 would not eat any solids until he was over a year old , he is dependent upon a wheelchair , and he is totally disinterested in food			1
mrs @entity64 said : ‘ his development is very delayed – he is behind his one - year - old sister			2
‘ no one knows why he is not interested in food but he would not survive without his tube because he will not eat – at one point he went three years without putting on any weight			0
’ mrs @entity64 , who is @entity17 ’s full - time carer , explained what it is like to have a child with @entity23			1
@entity100 - is the term used to describe disabled children who are thought to have a genetic syndrome that doctors are unable to identify			1
about 50 per cent of children with learning disabilities , and 60 per cent of children with multiple congenital problems , do not have a definitive diagnosis			2
the parents of @entity23 children often find their situation very isolating as no one is able to answer questions about their child 's future			1
she said : ‘ when you first find out your child is disabled you cling to the idea that it will be diagnosed – i pushed for lots of tests because i was desperate to know what was wrong , but the tests always came back normal			1
‘ some people worry that a diagnosis will be worse than not having one , but i think i would rather know because the fear of the unknown is worse than knowing what is going to happen			0
‘ at least if i knew what the future holds for him i could prepare myself , but we are always having to second guess with him			0
’ she added : ‘ it can be quite frustrating because we do not know why things are happening			0
‘ if we had a diagnosis we would have an idea of the eventual outcome – i would like to know what the future holds , to have a label			0
’ mrs @entity64 and her husband , an it specialist at the @entity143 , also have an eight - year - old son , @entity145 , and a 21 - month - old daughter , @entity146			2
they have a child minder who helps them care for @entity17 so that they can dedicate time to their other children			1
mrs @entity64 said : ‘ i struggled a lot at the beginning , having to come to terms with having a disabled son			0
but my husband is fantastic – he helps out with the morning and evening routine			0
‘ i think that having @entity17 as a brother will make my other children much more caring adults			1
‘ my oldest son just sees @entity17 as a brother – it is as simple as that , he does not see him as disabled			1
‘ @entity17 brings a huge amount of joy to the family – he is a very happy child , he has a lot of energy and he is always laughing			1
‘ he does n’t let his disability get in the way of having fun			0
he is an absolute delight and he is always making people laugh			0
’ mrs @entity64 says that she has been given a huge amount of support by the charity @entity19 which provides support to families with @entity23 children			1
she said : ‘ @entity19 is just amazing – so many people are in the same position as us and to be able to talk to them is invaluable			0
you need that support to know that you are not on your own			0
’ @entity188 , director of care @entity189 , a charity which also provides support to the families of children with life limiting disabilities and illnesses , including @entity23 , said : ‘ having a sick child can be a very isolating experience and when your child does not have a definite diagnosis , that sense of isolation can be magnified greatly			1
‘ there may not be other parents or families with whom you can identify , or share experiences , and other sources of support such as disease specific groups may not be available to you			0
‘ there are an increasing number of children living with complex health needs , many of whom may not have a “ name ” for their condition and who may have an increased need for support which is where organisations like @entity221 , which support families with or without diagnosis , are invaluable			2
