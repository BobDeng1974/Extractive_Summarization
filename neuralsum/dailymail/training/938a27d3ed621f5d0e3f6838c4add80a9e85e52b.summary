a @entity1 official said friday that the resignation of @entity4 undersecretary @entity3 was not voluntary , despite previous reports that he resigned out of anger with the @entity7			2
' there is no question that this is a termination of his job there before he was planning to go , ' @entity1 chief of staff @entity8 told @entity16 chief @entity1 correspondent @entity14 for an interview to air on @entity18 this sunday			1
@entity19 , the undersecretary for health care at the @entity21 , resigned abruptly on friday , just a day after telling a @entity23 committee that he knew in 2010 about a memo describing ' inappropriate scheduling practices ' now blamed for as many as 40 deaths at @entity21 medical centers			1
@entity19 , a 40 - year veteran of the @entity21 system and its undersecretary for health , tendered his resignation even though he was already scheduled to retire later in the year			1
the @entity1 announced his successor on may 1 but said @entity19 would remain in his job until @entity52 , director of the @entity21 's @entity54 - based @entity53 , wins @entity23 confirmation			1
secretary @entity56 requested and received @entity19 's resignation but has steadfastly insisted upon staying put himself , despite calls from prominent @entity59 and @entity60 for his ouster			1
@entity1 press secretary @entity62 released an approving statement late in the afternoon about the resignation , which was announced just an hour after his final daily press briefing of the week concluded			1
' the president supports secretary @entity56 ’s decision , ' @entity62 said , adding that president @entity69 ' has asked @entity70 to conduct a review of @entity73 practices and procedures at its facilities nationwide to ensure better access to care , and that review is ongoing			2
' ' the president and @entity70 take the allegations around misconduct very seriously , ' he added			0
@entity56 said in a statement that ' most veterans are satisfied with the quality of their @entity21 health care , but we must do more to improve timely access to that care			1
' on thursday , both @entity56 and @entity19 men testified in a @entity90 hearing			2
@entity56 said then that he was ' mad as hell ' about the growing scandal but would n't terminate any underlings until an inspector general report was completed			1
that report 's conclusions are expected in early june			0
@entity19 acknowledged to lawmakers that he had seen a 2010 memo titled ' @entity99 , ' which described failures in several of the @entity21 's 21 service regions			2
@entity56 , seated next to him , insisted that ' i was not , i am not ' aware of it			0
recent revelations blame shoddy management for the deaths of dozens of former soldiers , airmen , sailors and @entity110 , as administrators in @entity112 – and possibly elsewhere – maintained a secret off - the - books waiting list for veterans in need of critical care			1
official lists were kept short so the agency could appear to be doing its job despite some waits being more than a year long			0
in one case , a @entity112 official was awarded bonuses based on fraudulent statistics as veterans died waiting for medical care			1
' we have been working continuously to try and identify where those sites are and what we need to do to prevent that from happening			0
it 's absolutely inexcusable , ' @entity19 told lawmakers thursday			2
' the individuals are ... held accountable , ' he insisted , while admitting that ' i ca n't give you an example specifically			0
' ' but if someone were found to be manipulating inappropriately the scheduling system , they would be disciplined			0
' ' i do n't know whether anybody was specifically disciplined around that issue , ' he later conceded			0
next to go ? @entity19 ( r ) is out , but va secretary gen. @entity56 ( c ) is refusing to resign standing guard : members of the @entity149 have attended hearings and applied pressure throughout the @entity21 scandal , demanding @entity56 's resignation at every turn @entity156 @entity60 sen. @entity155 grilled @entity56 about the allegations of wrongdoing and demanded to know if he would ask the @entity159 to investigae			1
' we have more than allegations at this point , ' @entity155 said thursday			0
' we have evidence , solid evidence , of wrongdoing within the @entity21 system , and it is more than an isolated instance of wrongdoing – it ’s a pattern and practice			0
' @entity56 would say only that he would ' make that [ option ] available to the @entity21 inspector general ' if that ’s his request			1
' @entity4 secretary @entity56 's future is a delicate subject : he 's a decorated veteran , twice wounded in the @entity176 , a former army chief of staff , and a @entity179 - @entity178 who retired as a four - star general in addition to the @entity112 scandal , @entity21 offices have reportedly destroyed more than 1.5 million medical orders in recent years without confirming that patients received the treatment they were supposed to get			1
similar reporting has shown that backlogs of medical appointments in @entity190 and @entity21 facilities were wiped off the books to make appointment backlogs appear far shorter than they were			0
the @entity1 has expressed continued confidence in @entity56 , a wounded warrior who rose to the rank of four - star general before taking on the thankless job of managing the @entity21			1
key to the @entity69 administration 's defense of its leading veteran advocate is the ongoing inspector general investigation			2
but members of @entity203 are still smelling blood and want @entity56 to resign next			0
@entity206 ’ affairs chairman @entity205 , a @entity207 @entity59 , said in a statement friday that ' @entity19 's " resignation " is the pinnacle of disingenuous political doublespeak			2
@entity19 was already scheduled to retire in 2014 and president @entity69 has already announced his intention to nominate @entity19 ’s replacement , so characterizing this as a " resignation " just does n’t pass the smell test			0
' “ desperate to get ahead of a delays in care crisis that is growing by the day , yet apparently unwilling to take substantive actions to hold any of its leaders accountable for negligence that harms veterans , @entity21 has resorted to what it does best : splitting semantic hairs to create the illusion of accountability and progress , ' @entity205 added			2
@entity230 @entity229 sen. @entity229 said thursday that @entity69 ' needs to find a new leader to lead this organization out of the wilderness , and back to providing the service our veterans deserve			0
' @entity237 , chief policy officer for the @entity238 , told @entity239 that ' we do n’t need the @entity21 to find a scapegoat ; we need an actual plan to restore a culture of accountability throughout the @entity21			0
