@entity5 's side fell to their third league defeat of the season at @entity8 on sunday after defender @entity9 was sent off			1

@entity0 , who was an unused substitute in the match , wrote on his blog : ' playing away against @entity8 is always challenging because they have a big offensive potential , as it was shown , but having one player sent off in the first half just makes things more complicated			1
' this is the fifth [ it is actually third ] time this season that one of us gets a red card , so unfortunately we already know what it means to have one player less			2
' but even if @entity49 scored and we were just 10 , our team showed pride and almost tied the game , although this time it was not possible			0
' to be honest , right now , rather than looking at the table we have to focus on our path in order to improve and to win games			0
' the defender had been booked minutes earlier for charging down a @entity13 goal kick @entity49 won the contest for @entity8 on 63 minutes with his 12th goal of the season @entity1 manager @entity5 described @entity9 's dismissal as ' stupid ' @entity0 added that the defeat was ' hard to accept ' and that the ' whole team is very upset			1
' the defeat , @entity1 's fourth in succession against their rivals , leaves them 10th in the table with their lowest points return since 1986 , the year @entity69 took over			2
@entity0 added : ' obviously this situation is not what we wanted , but in this moment the team must stick together and keep on going			0
i 'm sure we will do it			0
' in addition to the three reds , @entity1 have also racked up 19 yellow cards in their @entity2 games so far			0
