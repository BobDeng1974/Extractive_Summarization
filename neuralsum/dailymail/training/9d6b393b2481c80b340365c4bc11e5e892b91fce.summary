the @entity8 's granddaughter , a keen horsewoman herself , attended every single day of the @entity9 meet , and every appearance was accompanied by a stunning outfit - and topped with an eye - catching hat			1
today 's offering was a design by milliner @entity16 , a wide - brimmed trilby trimmed with clutch of long pheasant feathers			0
the flamboyant piece perfectly set off a simple @entity21 coat in a light camel wool , which had crushed velvet flourishes at the cuffs , collar and pockets			0
smart choice : @entity1 nailed racing style yet again in a taupe coat with velvet collars , cuffs and pockets worn with a black trilby trimmed with long pheasant feathers today 's @entity35 hat was trimmed the latest in a sequence of spectacular headpieces @entity1 had been in the saddle herself last week , as she competed on her horse @entity39 at the @entity41 , and also rode to victory on @entity43 at the same event			1

famously thrifty , princess @entity45 recycled a favourite coat for the occasion , a green and grey coatthat she wore for the @entity54 church service last year			1
the princess royal is no stranger to reusing outfits she has had for many years - indeed we had seen the burnt orange coat she chose for @entity62 two days ago at the @entity63 last april			0
in 2007 , princess @entity45 wore a dress for a wedding that she had previously worn 27 years earlier for @entity66 and @entity68 's ceremony			1
thrifty : @entity45 , who has said in the past she has no qualms recycling outfits she has worn before , wore a green and grey patterned coat she wore to church last @entity54 day - with the same boots too recycling royal : princess @entity45 had worn the smart patterned coat before , for the @entity54 day church service at @entity79 lucky coat ? princess @entity45 wore today 's burnt orange overcoat at last year 's @entity63 too , right the royal two were among 50,000 fans who gathered to enjoy the first of four days of racing at @entity62			1
