by @entity0 and @entity1 , mail online deputy political editor nearly three quarters of countries will not accept passports given 12 month extensions under plans to alleviate the crisis , it has been revealed			1
home secretary @entity10 last week announced that expat @entity11 who need to renew their passports would be given one - year extensions			1

‘ people are still stuck without their passports unable to travel at what is the busiest holiday period of the year			0
while it ’s good that some will be able to travel on an extended passport , the @entity68 still have n’t got some of the most popular destination countries in the world to agree			0
‘ thousands of people will be looking forward to going to places like the @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 this summer but might not be able to because of the home secretary ’s passport backlog , and many major business locations like @entity44 and @entity43 are n’t accepting the extended passport scheme either			1
it ’s just not good enough from the home secretary and she needs to urgently get a grip and realise how important this is to people			0
‘ it ’s been months since we first learnt of the passport crisis created by @entity10 ’s mismanagement , and yet this news shows again that the government still have n’t realised how serious this is , and simply are n’t doing enough			2
in january responsibility for issuing these documents shifted from the @entity115 ’s seven overseas centres to the @entity116 in the @entity11			0

speaking in a @entity165 debate on the passport crisis on wednesday mrs may said : ' her majesty 's passport office is dealing with the highest demand for passports for 12 years while the surge in demand usually experienced during the summer months started much earlier in the year			2
' as a result , a number of people are waiting too long for their passport applications to be processed			1
' i would like to say to anybody who is unable to travel because of a delay in processing their passport application that i am sorry and the government is sorry for the inconvenience they have suffered and we are doing all we can to put things right			2
' but @entity109 heard that crisis is likely to get worse before it gets better this summer			0
@entity190 chairman @entity189 said : ' we have not yet reached the peak			0
we actually do need a timetable to get the " work - in - progress " working quickly			0
' he also claimed that @entity28 staff were ' profiting from the public 's hardship '			2
the @entity28 is making almost £ 13 on each application and should use the money to deal with the delays blighting @entity11 ' holiday plans , mr @entity189 said			1
he said officials should have realised in january that action was needed to avert the current crisis caused by a surge in demand , after being given updated figures by the @entity28			0
' it appears that the @entity28 is making a surplus of £ 13 on each application			1
it should not be profiting from the public 's hardship			0
' there are still 490,000 applications being dealt with and staff have had to work the equivalent of nearly £ 1 million in overtime in one month			0
the surplus from last year , and this , should be used to employ more staff to process the backlog quicker			0
' today 's commons debate came after it was revealed that the backlog of passport applications almost doubled in just three months this year			1
@entity28 chief @entity108 admitted almost 500,000 people are now waiting for their travel documents - some 200,000 higher than last year after a surge in applications in the first five months of the year			1
