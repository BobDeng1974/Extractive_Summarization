by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 05:31 est , 26 november 2013 @entity1 : @entity2 warned @entity3 could face a tax hit of more than £ 1,000 a year if they vote for independence scots face an income tax bombshell of more than a £ 1000 a year if they break away from the @entity9 , the @entity8 has warned			1
the stark message of the true cost of separation was set out by chief secretary to the treasury , @entity2 , in a letter to @entity3 first minister @entity15			1
he warned that @entity3 would have to find an extra £ 3 billion a year to plug the black hole in its finances if it became independent			1
it would amount to an eight percentage point rise in income tax for basic rate payers , taking their average tax bill up from £ 2,517 to £ 3,523 - an extra £ 20 a week			1
only if @entity3 came up with economic growth that was unseen in @entity26 for half a century could it avoid the tax rise			1
the damning finding deals a blow to the @entity32 ’s attempts to convince @entity3 of the case for independence as it prepares to publish its 600 page white paper making the case for independence today			0
but ahead of its publication , former chancellor @entity40 , chairman of the @entity43 campaign , said : ‘ if they ignore the cost of independence or claim that a vote by @entity3 can force other countries into doing what @entity15 wants , it will be a work of fiction			2
’ last week the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) published a report warning the basic rate of income tax in @entity3 would have to rise from 20p to 28p or make massive public spending cuts			1
@entity3 ’s ageing population and the predicted drop in oil revenues could leave it facing spending cuts or tax rises of 1.9 per cent of its national income			2
a further analysis of the @entity52 figures will be issued by the @entity8 today			0
in a letter to the @entity3 first minister , mr @entity2 said : ‘ one week ago the independent @entity52 ( @entity52 ) projected that under independence @entity3 public sector net debt could rise above 100 per cent of national income by the early 2030s and above 200 per cent of national income over 50 years			1
‘ this is not a sustainable position			0
even under the most optimistic scenario the @entity52 considered , in 2021 - 22 an independent @entity3 could have to find permanent tax increases or spending cuts that would be equivalent to £ 3 billion in today ’s terms			1
@entity8 officials had calculated that this would mean ‘ an average increase for basic rate tax payers in @entity3 of around £ 1000 per year ’			1
report : the findings may deal a blow to the @entity85 s attempts to convince @entity3 of the case for independence as it prepares to publish its 600 - page white paper making its case today an independent @entity3 would also have to grow by around 4.2 per cent a year for the next half century to reduce its debt to the same share of national income as the @entity9			1
it is a growth rate that no @entity26 country has managed for the last 50 years , mr @entity2 said			0
in response to mr @entity2 ’s letter , a spokesman for @entity97 finance secretary @entity96 said : ‘ this rushed and panicky letter from @entity2 shows just how rattled the no campaign are by the launch of the @entity103 and its positive vision for @entity3 ’s future			2
‘ the reality is the policies of his @entity109 - led government have cost many ordinary @entity3 far more than £ 1,000 each since they came to office			2
’ last night @entity3 secretary @entity112 issued a rallying call for non-scots to make their voices heard in the independence debate			0
‘ i am eager to hear from people in @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 as well			0
it should not just be @entity3 saying they want to remain in the @entity9 , ’ he told the @entity117			0
‘ there are more families than ever in @entity3 that have family in @entity128 , @entity119 and @entity120			0
these people do not want borders and barriers to be put up			0
’ education secretary @entity131 said he would remain a politician at @entity133 if @entity3 voted to go independent			2
but he added : ' one of the things i 'd find very difficult is accepting that the country which i grew up in , which defines my identity , was no longer part of the @entity140			0
' it would be ... a remarkable development when the identity with which we grew up had been shredded , ' he told @entity146 's @entity145 .			0

chief secretary to @entity8 wrote to @entity3 first minister @entity15
warned independent @entity3 would have to find £ *3billion* per year
eight percentage point rise in income tax for basic rate payers , he said
