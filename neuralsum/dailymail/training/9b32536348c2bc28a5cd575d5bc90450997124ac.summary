the @entity1 ice sheet is more unstable than first thought with a new study suggesting melting began 5,000 years earlier than previously believed			1
the study reveals that shrinking of the vast ice sheet accelerated during eight distinct periods between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago causing a rapid sea level rise			1
during one period 14,600 years ago , melting glaciers released so many icebergs into the ocean that sea level rose 6.5ft ( 2 metres ) in just 100 years			1
pictured is one of many icebergs that sheared off the continent and ended up in the @entity18 the results provide the first clear evidence for dramatic melting in @entity1 's and reflect predictions for the region 's future			1
it also follows recent news that destabilisation of part of the @entity1 ice sheet has already begun and could be ' unstoppable			1
' the study was conducted by an international team including researchers from @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			0
the group examined two sediment cores from the @entity18 between @entity40 and @entity41 that contained ‘ iceberg - rafted debris ’			1
this is debris that has been scraped off @entity40 by moving ice and deposited via icebergs into the sea			0
as the icebergs melted , they dropped minerals into the seafloor sediments , giving scientists a glimpse into the past behaviour of the @entity1 ice sheet			1
an international team examined two sediment cores from the @entity18 to uncover the history of the @entity59			1
in this image researchers aboard the @entity62 @entity61 are shown recovering the sediment cores periods of rapid increase in iceberg - rafted debris suggest that more icebergs were being released by the @entity1 ice sheet			1
the researchers discovered increased amounts of debris during eight separate episodes beginning as early as 20,000 years ago , and continuing until 9,000 years ago			1
up until now , the melting of the @entity1 ice sheet was n't thought to have started until 14,000 years ago			1
‘ conventional thinking based on past research is that the @entity1 ice sheet has been relatively stable since the last ice age , that it began to melt relatively late during the deglaciation process , and that its decline was slow and steady until it reached its present size , ’ said lead author @entity71 , a scientist from the @entity72 in @entity33			1
as the icebergs melted , they dropped minerals into the seafloor sediments , giving scientists a glimpse into the past behaviour of the @entity59			0
pictured is the @entity87 aboard the @entity62 @entity61 which was used to retrieve the sediment cores ‘ the sediment record suggests a different pattern – one that is more episodic and suggests that parts of the ice sheet repeatedly became unstable during the last deglaciation , ’ professor @entity71 added			1
the research has provided the first solid evidence that the @entity1 ice sheet contributed to what is known as ‘ @entity98 ’ , @entity98 was a period when sea levels rose rapidly from between 52 to 79ft ( 16 to 24m ) around 14,600 to 13,500 years			1
the largest of the eight episodic pulses outlined in the new nature study coincides with this event			0
‘ during that time , the sea level on a global basis rose about 50 feet in just 350 years – or about 20 times faster than sea level rise over the last century , ’ said professor @entity105 , an @entity106			2
‘ we do n't yet know what triggered these eight episodes or pulses , but it appears that once the melting of the ice sheet began it was amplified by physical processes			2
’ the group examined two sediment cores from the @entity18 between @entity40 and @entity41 that contained ' iceberg - rafted debris			2
' this is debris that has been scraped off @entity40 by moving ice and deposited via icebergs into the sea vast glaciers in @entity40 seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries , according to scientists			0
in a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 feet ( 1.2 to 3.7 metres ) to current sea levels			2
a @entity135 study looking at 40 years of ground , airplane and satellite data of what researchers call ' the weak underbelly of @entity40 ' shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted , crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino - like process			0
evidence shows ' a large sector of the @entity1 ice sheet has gone into a state of irreversible retreat ' , says lead author @entity150 of the @entity151 , and @entity135 's @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity154			2
the coastal ends of the glaciers rest on bedrock below sea level , holding back a vast weight of ice and making them vulnerable to melt , he said			1
' it does seem to be happening quickly , ' says @entity164 glaciologist @entity163 , lead author of a separate study into the same phenomenon			0
' we really are witnessing the beginning stages			0
' it 's likely because of man - made global warming and the ozone hole which have changed the @entity1 winds and warmed the water that eats away at the feet of the ice , researchers said at a @entity135 news conference monday			2
' the system is in sort of a chain reaction that is unstoppable , ' continued @entity150			0
' every process in this reaction is feeding the next one			0
it 's passed the point of no return			0
' scientists say curbing carbon emissions wo n't be able to stop the collapse of these glaciers , but may slow the process and at least prevent the them from melting at their current speed the researchers suspect that a feedback mechanism may have accelerated the melting , possibly by changing ocean circulation that brought warmer water to the @entity1 subsurface			2
‘ this positive feedback is a perfect recipe for rapid sea level rise , ’ said co-author @entity197 , a climate researcher at the @entity35 at @entity199			0
some 9,000 years ago , the episodic pulses of melting stopped , the researchers say			1
‘ just as we are unsure of what triggered these eight pulses , ’ professor @entity105 said , ‘ we do n't know why they stopped			0
‘ perhaps the sheet ran out of ice that was vulnerable to the physical changes that were taking place			0
‘ however , our new results suggest that the @entity1 ice sheet is more unstable than previously considered			2
’ today , the annual calving of icebergs from @entity1 represents more than half of the annual loss of mass of the @entity1 ice sheet – an estimated 1,300 to 2,000 billion tonnes			1
earlier this month , @entity135 said vast glaciers in @entity40 seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries , according to scientists			0
in a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 ft ( 1.2 to 3.7 metres ) to current sea levels			0
scientists say the early stages of collapse have already begun and there 's nothing we can do to stop it			0

ice sheet melt increased in 8 periods between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago
during one period 14,600 years ago , melting glaciers released so many icebergs into the ocean that sea level rose 6.5ft ( 2 metres ) in just 100 years
discovery was made after analysing sediment cores from the @entity18
melting of ice sheet was n't thought to have started until 14,000 years ago
it follows news that destabilisation of @entity1 has already begun
