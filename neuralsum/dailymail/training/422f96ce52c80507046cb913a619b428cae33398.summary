by @entity0 published : 06:23 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 07:46 est , 20 august 2013 the number of men opting for beard transplants has rocketed in the past year , according to new research			1
figures have revealed that the amount of men having the procedure - which usually involves patching up areas rather than transplanting an entire beard - has risen by 13 per cent in just 12 months			1
the facial hair transplant is now three times as popular as the rhinoplasty or nose - job among men			1
this shows how a facial hair transplant can help fill in sparse patches of hair , such as in the sideburns			1
most men opt for patch transplants rather than entire beard transplants , according to surgeons it is thought that the celebrity trend for facial hair is driving the boom , with famous faces such as @entity29 and @entity30 proving to be influential			1
recently @entity32 's @entity31 caused a @entity34 storm after he was seen to be sporting a full bush of beard growth after returning from holiday			1
one patient to have had the novel surgery is a 48 - year - old farmer , who chose to have a hair transplant to fill in his meagre sideburns			0
@entity29 24 per cent @entity42 20 per cent @entity43 13 per cent @entity30 11 per cent @entity31 10 per cent @entity44 8 per cent @entity45 6 per cent @entity46 4 per cent @entity47 3 per cent @entity48 1 per cent he said he had ' always felt his masculinity had been undermined by not being able to grow proper " mutton chops "			1
' his operation was carried out by the @entity53 's surgeon @entity52 , who has also performed hair transplants on a number of celebrities			1
during the operation hair was harvested from the back of his head via follicular unit extraction ( @entity62 ) , where individual hairs are taken and implanted into the area being treated			0
the procedure usually takes around three hours			1
during the unnamed patient 's procedure specifically , mr @entity52 transplanted 200 grafts - there are between one and three hairs in each graft - into each of the patient 's sideburns			2
mr @entity52 claimed he had witnessed a 25 per cent rise in the number of procedures over the last three years as beards have become more fashionable			0
celebrities including @entity29 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) are thought to have fuelled the boom in facial hair transplants			1
the procedure is now three times more popular than the male rhinoplasty or nose - job he said : ' a proper , full - grown beard has been the ultimate definition of masculinity for centuries			2
' but many men struggle to grow beards , sideburns and moustaches			2
' they have significant gaps in their facial hair and the end result can look patchy and unconvincing			0
he added that patchy facial hair was often a genetic problem			0
he said : ' if the father had trouble growing a beard then there is a good chance the son will also have patchy facial hair			0
dr @entity52 has carried out two hair transplants on embarrassing bodies star @entity108			0
dr @entity108 turned to him after being taunted on @entity34 about his thinning hair			0
and mr @entity52 is n't the only person to wiotness a shrp rise in business			0
having pioneered the world â€™s first facial hair transplant in 1996 , dr @entity113 , founder of the @entity114 , claims he has seen a six-fold year on year increase in the amount of men having surgery to boost their facial follicles over the last five years			2
trendsetter ? @entity31 caused a media storm when he appeared on @entity32 with a hairy accessory on his face he said : ' a full beard is very much a statement look , and it goes in and out of fashion			1
for the last 12 to 18 months , there has been a noticeable rise in the number of men coming to my practice wanting to fill in bald patches or thicken wisps of hair			1
' according to the @entity138 , more than 4,500 procedures were carried out in the @entity139 last year , 13 per cent more than those performed the previous year			0
this is over 300 per cent more than the 1,043 rhinoplasties undergone by men in the @entity139 during the same year			2
but while having a full face of bristles may boost a man 's self esteem , the effect appears to be lost on many women			0
a recent survey of how beards are perceived by the opposite sex found that two - thirds of women preferred the clean - shaven look to a beard			0
however , no hair is n't necessarily better - the poll revealed that 48 per cent of women found stubble sexier than a bare face .			2

it is thought hirsute celebrities including @entity29 , @entity30 and even @entity31 are driving the trend for hairier faces
most men are having patches of sparse growth filled in and some are undergoing the procedure to have the perfect ' *designer* stubble '
