' everything used within the tips can be found in a make - up bag or made with things that you can find at a supermarket or online			2
' what you 'll need - @entity191 cleanser - hair pin or band - @entity196 ( a mix of silicon and a curing agent ) or porridge oats and petroleum jelly - @entity203 filler or seedless raspberry jam and cooking glycerine - @entity205 - cuticle stick - @entity208 paint palette ( red , yellow , brown , purple colours ) - sponge , paint brush , wet wipes , fixing agent or talcum powder - fake blood - hairspray a comb and hair conditioner here we go : she applies ghostly foundation as the transformation gets under way how to do it top tip : ensure you are n’t allergic to any new products you might use by performing a patch test on the wrist 24 hours before you begin step 1 : preparation massage some cleanser into the face to create a base			0
this will allow the skin to be moist and eases the removal at the end of the process pin back hair to see the full face and to stop stray hairs getting into the make - up step 2 : create cuts and scars use sculpt gel to create cuts and scars across the face apply the gel to the face , using a cuticle stick to move the gel around and create shapes – get creative and think about how your walker wound got there ! do n’t be too even			0
nature does n’t work in straight lines and symmetry is seen as traditionally beautiful so we want to avoid this ! top tip : sculpt gel can be bought online or within specialist make up shops			0
porridge oats mixed with petroleum jelly make a great back up if you ca n’t find it @entity271 ’s tip : think about what happened to the @entity273 for them to look like this and begin to tell a story through the make - up step 3 : dry the wounds when you know where you want the wound , use a hair dryer on a low heat setting and work quickly to shape the cut using a cuticle stick getting ready : massage some cleanser into the face to create a base			0
this will allow the skin to be moist and eases the removal at the end of the process step 4 : add dark shadows to the recesses of the face using a grease paint palette of just a few basic darker colours - you can get these from fancy dress shops or specialist make up stores - and a sponge or paint brush to apply add dark shadows under the eyes , temples and the nose			0
you want to really exaggerate where the natural shadow is for this top tip : think of a skeleton ’s face when doing this and try and mimic that look ! step 5 : create a unifying base use a yellow grease paint and a sponge and blend it to create an even base tone you can also highlight certain areas around the darker patches using complimentary colours to create a gaunt look top tip : check out a colour wheel before you start to decide on which colours work best together step 6 : highlight wounds using light red colouring and a sponge , highlight the dried wound and make it standout you can remove any excess with a wet wipe , but smudging and smears give a more authentic walker look – it should n’t look too perfect ! top tip : less is more here ! @entity346 touches : fill in the wounds with wound filler which you can get from specialist make up shops , dabbing it with a paint brush to build up in layers step 7 : exaggerate features go over the eyelids and lips with a purple or brown hue using a paintbrush to really exaggerate those features you ’re aiming here to give the areas a bruised look top tip : stand further away from the mirror so you can see yourself overall rather than focussing on one area step 8 : fill the wounds fill in the wounds with wound filler which you can get from specialist make up shops , dabbing it with a paint brush to build up in layers highlight the highs and lows with a range of bruise tones , giving the wounds depth and a less uniform colour you can go over the wounds with a fixing agent or talcum powder so the colour does n’t run top tip : you can make your own wound filler by mixing seedless raspberry jam with cooking glycerine step 9 : add blood paint fake blood on to the wounds to give it a more gory look you can also flick the blood onto the face with a toothbrush for a more authentic splattered look @entity271 ’s tip : think about how your @entity273 got their injury and use that to consider how you should apply the blood and where to			0
for example , a gunshot wound will look different to a cut step 10 : dress the hair apply a little conditioner and back comb the hair in sections spray with hairspray to achieve the messy look top tip : finishing touches and accessories really make the look , so consider everything from your clothes to your hair in your overall presentation			0
