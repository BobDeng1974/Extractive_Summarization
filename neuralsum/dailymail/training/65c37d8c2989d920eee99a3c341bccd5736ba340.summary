they went through so much after they were born			1
' i feel so lucky to have them all here			1
' it was hilarious watching them fiddle with wrapping paper and scoff their cake			2
i was tearful a number of times			2
' it 's strange in a way because i felt so happy to be celebrating with them , but their birthday also brought back memories of how difficult and scary things were at first			2
@entity13 , a former medical secretary , and gardener husband @entity14 , 30 , could n't wait to have children - and started trying immediately after their wedding in may , 2010			2

eventually , the little boys were transferred one by one to the @entity93 in @entity94 , where they stayed until they were allowed home on february 18 , still three weeks short of their march 6 due date			1
@entity13 said : ' it was a very strange time for us			2
' while the boys were in hospital , especially at first , it was almost like an out - of - body experience			2
we existed in our own bubble inside the hospitals			2
every day it seemed there was a new emergency and we were constantly terrified and exhausted			2
' ' @entity108 was the worst			0
@entity7 and @entity6 had been transferred to @entity94 , but @entity5 was still in @entity71			1
we spent half a day with each , and wound up having pizza for dinner			1
we did n't buy the boys any presents - we did n't dare in case they did n't make it			0
' this year will be completely different			0
we 'll have presents and a big dinner at home before heading off to see family			0

initially , @entity13 was breastfeeding all three boys - for three hours at a time , with just a one hour break in between			0
now , her day is a series of feeds , nappy changes , play time and chasing the boys around from 5.30am to 7pm , when she collapses on the couch with a glass of wine to watch @entity145			0
she said : ' my life completely changed with the boys			0
i have very little time to myself			0
in fact , we hardly leave the house because it 's so difficult			0

' my parents take the boys for one weekend each month , just so i have some time to sit and think			0
sometimes we 'll meet friends at a pub , but often we 're too tired			0
our marriage has had to go on the back burner to be honest			0
but we keep going because we know one day it will be back to normal , when the boys are older			0
' sometimes it 's lonely being a mum of multiples - spending so much time at home			0
but i would never wish my boys away			0
' they melt my heart and i 'm so happy to be a mum of three			0
