for 50 years , @entity0 has been one of football ’s most colourful and outspoken characters			1
now he ’s written a book every fan will want to read			1
in his new book ' a man walks on to a pitch ' - serialised exclusively by @entity9 this week - @entity0 explores the decline of @entity12 managers in the modern game			1
@entity14 could n’t have done a better job with @entity16 than @entity17 did last year			1
yet did his heroics in the @entity19 and @entity20 create even a ripple at @entity22 ? was @entity17 , a great competitor and wonderful player for @entity24 , even considered for the @entity24 job ? ok , a few times in his career it has n’t worked out but that would be true of @entity30 , too , if he had spent his managerial life at clubs like @entity33 , @entity34 or @entity16			1
i do n’t understand why owners suddenly lost faith in @entity39 managers			1
unless @entity41 or @entity42 gets the job , do you really see @entity44 appointing an @entity12 to @entity45 ? or even a @entity39 manager ? maybe @entity47 might come into the frame , but would he leave @entity49 for @entity50 ? foreign players , foreign coaches , foreign owners			1
@entity17 led @entity16 to the @entity55 last season where they lost to @entity57 in extra time at @entity59 @entity17 played more than 300 games for @entity24 during his spell with the @entity22 club @entity64 - @entity63 @entity66 - @entity65 @entity17 - @entity16 @entity67 - @entity68 @entity70 - @entity69 @entity0 - @entity71 @entity73 - @entity72 @entity75 - @entity74 i ’ve got a great relationship with the @entity71 owner @entity78 — and i ’m too old to be a creep , so believe me , i mean it — but not every manager is as lucky			1
club chairmen talk to current players , they talk to ex-players , they talk to agents , to a ring of yes - men — and then they come away thinking they know more than the manager			2
sometimes a foreign coach gets the benefit of the doubt , but @entity39 managers are increasingly coming under particularly harsh scrutiny			1
i do n’t see the new breed of owner — with their ‘ keep throwing money at it and eventually you ’ll be all right ’ approach — giving @entity39 coaches a chance			1
it was a real setback that @entity105 did not do better at @entity24 , although it was always going to be hard to be the man who followed sir @entity107			2
and where ’s the next generation of @entity12 managers coming from ? will the current top tier of @entity12 players go through the leagues to prove themselves , as @entity17 has done ? lads who have had 10 seasons at @entity45 in the @entity44 years wo n’t get out of bed for what the manager of @entity118 gets paid			1
now he ’s finished at @entity45 , would he really want to take a job at , say , @entity121 , the way i worked at @entity124 ? he probably earned three times as much in one week as the @entity121 manager does in one year			1
will @entity41 want to drop down the divisions as a manager when he hangs up his boots for good ? @entity0 pictured at @entity124 , where he started his managerial career and stayed for nine years @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 make @entity0 's modern era @entity135 @entity136 would have solved @entity12 's problems ... he was born to play left wing @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 make @entity0 's early era @entity135 @entity143 heralded a change in @entity12 football ... he introduced @entity146 and scouting reports @entity148 has the class of @entity150 but his attitude is holding back his talent @entity153 and @entity139 are warriors ... they were even prepared to do battle while working on tv ! @entity153 nearly crossed @entity157 to join @entity158 ... and @entity159 was close to signing too pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players ... the @entity19 killed all that ! @entity9 's @entity166 interviews @entity0 about his new book let ’s face it , if you ’ve been earning £ 200,000 a week , are you going to take a job for £ 80,000 a year that involves going out every night watching inferior games and inferior players on the off - chance of finding a gem ? i greatly admire anyone from the modern generation who fancies putting themselves through that			1
i ’ve been around plenty of @entity19 dressing - rooms and i do n’t hear many players talk about watching matches from the lower leagues			1
i do n’t see guys like @entity189 rushing to take a post in the lower divisions , though i hear he is doing his coaching badges and i ’d like to see him get into it			2
@entity136 has gone into coaching , but it was never even considered that he might follow the @entity197 route and end up at @entity198			2
it was always going to be at @entity24 or nothing			2
if @entity201 had phoned him i think it would have been the shortest conversation of all time			0
so @entity136 has not taken that risk			0
why would he test himself against a guy like @entity208 at @entity209 ? @entity208 will never get a @entity19 job , but his record as a lower - division manager is outstanding			1
he gets in a lot of trouble over his comments to referees and officials , but he has proven himself a promotion expert with both @entity219 and @entity209 in recent seasons			0
would @entity136 know what he was doing in a lower division up against him ? @entity208 knows where to look for players , he ’s out grafting all the time and he knows how to put a @entity227 or @entity228 team together			2
@entity136 would n’t have a clue by comparison			0
@entity208 ( left ) wo n't get a @entity19 job but would @entity136 challenge him in the lower leagues ? @entity233 ( centre ) and @entity235 have established themselves as leading pundits on @entity238 the modern players are as likely to want to be media men or agents as run a team , and i do n’t blame them			1
@entity139 is working in the game at @entity245 and @entity246 , but it seems a real shame to have a man of his stature outside @entity24			2
would they have come seventh last season if @entity139 had been around to pull the players up ? he would have been after them as he always was in the peak years , when there were no short - cuts at @entity24 and those messages were passed from sir @entity107 , through @entity139			0
there is a story of him laying into @entity262 , the goalkeeper , for turning up late on his first day of training			0
@entity262 said he ’d got lost			2
@entity139 ’s point was that on his own first day at the club , he got up early , hired a taxi and followed it to the training ground in his car to ensure he arrived on time			0
he had incredible professional standards and expected the same of everybody			0
it ’s great to have a player like that in your team			0
every manager wants a @entity280 , a @entity42 or a @entity139 , a player who will have a go			2
i know @entity139 had a reputation for being high maintenance but i never found him that way			0
he was as good as gold as a manager and if you asked him about players you always got excellent , straight opinions			2
@entity139 is @entity245 's assistant manager but @entity24 missed his presence last season @entity139 's influence at @entity24 might have ensured they did better than finish seventh last campaign @entity42 is another influential player			1
he ’s one of those that change a club			0
if we could take him to @entity71 from @entity45 i would feel very confident , just with that one signing alone , that we would stay up			1
he gets people at it , he ’s a talker , he takes charge of the dressing - room			0
it ’s hard to find leaders , though i ’m lucky enough to have @entity133 with me			0
it ’s hard to find talkers , organisers			0
i do n’t know why , but it is so hard to find a player prepared to speak his mind			0
everyone now is waiting to receive information ; they all exist in their own little worlds			0
they do n’t talk to each other off the pitch or on the coach			2
everyone sits there with headphones , looking at an @entity324 or playing a computer game			0
is it any wonder modern players lack communication skills ? @entity45 captain @entity42 is one of the games ' best leaders and takes charge of the dressing room @entity42 is the modern day @entity280 and a throwback in the way he bosses his team @entity42 is a throwback in the way he bosses a team			1
i ’ve got a lot of time for @entity42 , even though i know his career has not been without controversy			0
the modern @entity280 — i ca n’t pay him a higher compliment than that			0
some people may think @entity42 is a dubious role model , but i would have no hesitation in saying to any of the young academy defenders at @entity71 : ‘ go and watch @entity45 tonight , go and watch @entity42 , study him all game ’			1
if they pay attention they will learn more in that 90 minutes than in a month of training sessions			0
if @entity45 ever lose faith in @entity42 , i ’d take him like a shot			1

@entity0 's latest book , a man walks on to a pitch , is being serialised by @entity9 this week
@entity14 could n't have done a better job at @entity16 than @entity17
@entity71 boss questions why owners have lost faith in @entity39 bosses ?
@entity44 is unlikely to appoint an @entity12 manager at @entity45
likes of @entity41 are unlikely to want to start off in lower leagues
