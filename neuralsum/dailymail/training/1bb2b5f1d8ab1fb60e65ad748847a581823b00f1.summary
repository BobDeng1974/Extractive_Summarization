by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 13:26 est , 10 march 2014 a 22 - year - old woman who was told by doctors she would never get pregnant naturally has revealed her joy at being @entity6 's youngest mother of identical quadruplets			1
@entity8 defied 25 million - to - one odds when she gave birth to four girls two years ago			1
she had previously been warned she would probably never have a family without @entity14 treatment			0
@entity8 , 22 , has become @entity6 's youngest mother of identical quadruplets after it was discovered that @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 are identical			1
she is pictured with her partner , @entity19 so ms @entity8 was stunned when she conceived naturally and was told she was carrying four babies			1
on december 11 , 2011 she gave birth to 3lbs 6oz @entity16 , 3lbs 4oz @entity17 , 2lbs 9oz @entity22 and 2lbs 6oz @entity15			1
doctors initially believed she had two sets of identical twins but after the girls ’ father , @entity19 , struggled to tell his daughters apart dna evidence revealed all four girls are identical			1
it means ms @entity8 , a trainee neo-natal nurse , is @entity6 's youngest mother of identical quadruplets which could see her enter the record books			1
the mother , from @entity35 , @entity36 , said : ‘ i always knew my girls were special but now they could be record breakers too			2
‘ i really ca n't believe the girls are identical			1
it was initially thought ms @entity8 was carrying two sets of identical twins because scans revealed there were two sacs inside her womb ‘ we paid to have the dna tests done because i was noticing they all looked so alike and @entity19 was struggling to tell them apart			1
‘ we got the results last week which showed the girls are all identical			1
‘ after looking on the internet the only other youngest mum of identical quadruplets was 27			1
i was 19 when i carried them and 20 when i had them			2
i 'm sure i must be the youngest			0
’ it is most common for quadruplets to occur when four separate eggs are fertilised by four separate sperm			2
if this happens , none of the babies are identical			1
however , quads can also occur when one fertilised egg splits into four - this causes four identical babies			1
quads can also be made up of identical triplets and another baby , two sets of identical twins or one set of identical twins and two non-identical babies			1
quads are most common in women undergoing fertility treatment			0
women with a family history of multiple births , @entity80 women and older mothers are also all at increased risk of multiple births			0
the chances of having quads in the @entity6 is one in 142,000			0
for mothers not undergoing fertility treatment , the chance of having quads is one in 729,000			0
ms @entity8 was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries when she was 15			1
the condition restricts ovulation dramatically reducing a woman 's chances of becoming pregnant			2
but five years later she stunned doctors when she conceived naturally and was dumbfounded when she discovered she was expecting four girls			2
worried doctors advised her to abort two of her babies over concerns all four would struggle to survive in the womb			2
but she refused and today she has four identical healthy baby girls			2
she said : ‘ i never expected to fall pregnant so it was a real surprise when i was told i was expecting			2
‘ when the doctors said i should abort two of the babies i was devastated			2
i said “ no , just no. it 's murder			0
” i do n't believe in abortion			0
‘ i 'm so happy i stuck to my guns because i have four healthy babies			2
‘ i had a scan at six weeks and it looked like there were two different sacs which meant i was going to have two sets of twins			0
‘ the labour was fine up until 24 weeks when i was admitted to hospital and then i was transferred up to @entity120 where i stayed until they were born			0
‘ i nearly died because my weight dropped , i just could n't eat enough for all of us			0
i was eating enough for the babies but not for me			0
‘ i do n't really remember the labour which was when i was 30 weeks , i just remember seeing three heads			0
ms @entity8 was told she would probably not be able to have children naturally because of polycystic ovaries ‘ we were kept in hospital and the girls were in a neo-natal unit but we were all home eight weeks later			1
‘ luckily the girls have always been really good and have always had a good routine			0
‘ as they got older we realised how similar they all looked but we had always been told by the doctors they were two pairs of twins			0
‘ we did n't bother to question it at first but then we thought we would check because we knew how rare it was			0
’ at christmas ms @entity8 , who is engaged to the girls ' father , @entity143 , 27 , decided to pay for a dna test on her daughters			1
mr @entity143 , who works at @entity147 , said : ‘ it was a big shock to the system			0
dna test results have now revealed that the quadruplets are definitely all identical ‘ to find out you 're having one is enough of a surprise , but four is very different			1
‘ it feels extremely special now we know they 're identical but i 'm going to have to find a way of telling them apart			0
‘ i can struggle to tell them apart and i 'm always getting them confused			0
‘ they soon tell me though when i call them the wrong name , i am sure they will be using it to their advantage when they are older			0
’ the girls will now join 70 sets of all - identical quadruplets worldwide .			1
