by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:13 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 18:06 est , 13 august 2013 as @entity4 ’s fearsome interrogator , @entity2 has become notorious for extracting the truth from business leaders and politicians			1
now , however , he is putting his own employer under the spotlight			2
the presenter has accused the @entity11 of pogonophobia – that is , an irrational fear of beards			2
and he is launching a one - man crusade to end discrimination against unshaven men			2
although reactions to his new look were divided – with some viewers saying he looked like a ‘ rubbish @entity41 ’ – @entity2 insisted he would not bow to demands to shave it off			1
he said : ‘ i have grown a beard for the last few summers , and suddenly wondered whether i really needed to shave it off			0
‘ unless you ’re lucky enough to be @entity48 on @entity49 , @entity50 or @entity51 , the @entity11 is generally as pogonophobic as the late - lamented @entity53 dictator , @entity52			2
‘ i may keep it or i may shave it off , but i think i ’ll make my own decision			0
’ communist @entity52 , who ruled @entity57 for 40 years until his death in 1985 , made all beards in the country illegal because he regarded them as unhygienic			0
spot the difference : the broadcaster on @entity64 on monday night and , right , a clean - shaven @entity2 some had a similar aversion to @entity2 ’s effort when he unveiled it for the first time on monday night			1
' unless you ’re lucky enough to be @entity48 on @entity49 , @entity50 or @entity51 , the @entity11 is generally as pogonophobic as the late - lamented @entity53 dictator , @entity52 ' @entity2 within minutes of his appearance , it became one of the most talked - about subjects on @entity24			1
@entity2 ’s colleague @entity26 responded by joking : ‘ right that ’s it			1
i ’m working on a moustache for thursday ’s @entity4			1
’ before long , doctored photos of @entity78 sporting a pair of handlebars were circulating online			0
she posted the image on her own @entity24 profile , saying : ‘ i remind myself of @entity83			0
’ shortly after @entity2 ’s comments , other @entity11 presenters came forward with their own tales of beard discrimination			1
comparison : @entity2 said that apart from @entity48 ( left ) from @entity49 , and hook - handed hate preacher @entity90 ( right ) , the @entity89 had a phobia of beards @entity93 , who shot to fame on @entity95 in 2000 before presenting @entity96 , said : ‘ lots of stories about beardism out there			1
i was once told i ’d lose my job if i did n’t lose the beard			0
i have @entity2 beard envy			2
‘ every time i grow one i get told to shave by television execs			0
tv hates a good beard			0
’ ' i was once told i ’d lose my job if i did n’t lose the beard			0
i have @entity2 beard envy ' @entity93 , @entity96 presenter meanwhile @entity110 , the retired presenter of @entity111 ’s @entity113 programme , said : ‘ i was told that if i seriously wanted to do more , i would have to get rid of my beard			1
’ other @entity11 stars to face anti-beard diktats include newsreader @entity117 , who was ordered to shave in 1999 after returning from a family holiday , and @entity119 , who said he was taken off the shortlist to host the @entity121 because of his beard			0
@entity2 has not always been such a staunch supporter of the right to grow facial hair			1
on @entity4 in 1997 he questioned why @entity127 mp @entity126 had been made health secretary , adding in an exasperated tone : ‘ but he ’s got a beard ! ’			0

stern 63 - year - old broadcaster left viewers ' in shock ' with new facial hair
fellow presenter @entity26 : ' i *'m* working on moustache for thursday '
some viewers say @entity2 looks ' *louche* ' , ' distinguished ' and ' *gorgeous* '
others compared him to ' @entity144 ' , a *castaway* or a ' rubbish @entity41 '
