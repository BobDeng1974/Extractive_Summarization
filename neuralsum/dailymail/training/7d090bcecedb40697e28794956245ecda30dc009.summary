the @entity0 is backing away from an idle warning issued sunday by secretary @entity2 , who had said a @entity5 terror group 's threat against the @entity6 would complicate the possibility that his agency could be partially shut down by the weekend			1
@entity9 is still battling over a @entity0 budget that it put on a short leash in december , with republicans threatening to put the agency in default rather than allowing president @entity15 to move forward with a plan to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants			1
' if anyone is planning to go to the @entity6 today , they have got to be particularly careful , ' @entity2 told a @entity22 audience on sunday			1
he steered most of the interview toward dire warnings about what would happen if his budget remains in limbo past its feb. 27 expiration date			0
' @entity45 , the most active jihadi group in @entity5 , released a video saturday online that recalled its involvement in a 2013 @entity62 attack in @entity63 , @entity64 , and urged @entity65 to attack three shopping meccas			1
the terror network 's named targets include the @entity6 , @entity69 in @entity48 and @entity51 's @entity50 corridor			1
do n't defund me : secretary @entity2 is already blaming @entity73 in @entity9 for an expected partial agency shutdown that may hit @entity0 after its funding runs out on friday night the @entity64 mass - shooting killed 67 and injured at least 175			1
saturday 's video showed the @entity6 and the shopping center 's gps coordinates			2
it called for ' @entity62 - style ' attacks against ' @entity42 or @entity82 shopping centers			0
' the @entity6 welcomes about 42 million shoppers every year – more than eight times @entity85 's entire population – and employs 12,000 people , pumping more than $ 2 billion into the state 's economy			1
overall it occupies 4.8 million square feet , a large enough space to fit seven @entity91 stadiums			0
@entity85 is the epicenter of @entity5 immigration into the @entity42 , hosting more than 25,000 refugees from the northeastern @entity96 nation			2
that 's more than 28 per cent of the more than 85,700 such @entity5 who live in the @entity42			2
scenes from the @entity99 : of the 85,700 @entity5 refugees living in the @entity42 , 25,000 live in @entity85 – and some might be sympathetic to their countrymen in @entity45 playground : mall of @entity42 puts more than $ 2 billion into the @entity85 economy every year its head office in @entity107 , @entity85 said in a statement that it would ' continue to monitor events with the help of federal , state and local law enforcement agencies			1
as always , we take any potential threat seriously and respond appropriately			0
' ' @entity6 has implemented extra security precautions , some may be noticeable to guests , and others wo n't be			0
we will continue to follow the situation , along with law enforcement , and will remain vigilant as we always do in similar situations			0
' @entity122 , a former @entity123 assistant director in @entity124 , told a @entity126 audience on sunday that the @entity123 has a ' huge job in front of them			0
' ' you look at the @entity6 , you look at all the malls then you start to backtrack and say you know it would be nice if we knew what comes and goes into the country , ' he said			0
' we do n't have a clue			0
' @entity139 , 2013 : @entity45 claimed responsibility for the @entity62 shooting that killed more than 60 people @entity2 remarked on @entity22 that it 's significant to see @entity45 and the @entity145 terror army urging muslims to launch attacks in the @entity69 on their behalf			1
' we 're beyond the phase now where these groups would sendforeign operatives into countries after being trained someplace , ' the @entity0 chief said			0
on monday he appeared for a brief press conference in which he pilloried congressional republicans for threatening to hold up his agency 's budget			2
a ' shutdown ' would n't affect more than 80 per cent of @entity0 's workforce , since they are considered ' essential ' national security personnel – although they would have to wait to get paid until after the stalemate ends .			2

@entity2 warned on sunday that ' if anyone is planning to go to the @entity6 today , they have got to be particularly careful '
*veiled* threat was meant to *underscore* his complaints that @entity0 will be defunded if @entity9 does n't approve a 2015 budget by friday night
but the agency walked the whole *episode* back on monday , *insisting* ' we are not aware of any specific , credible plot '
the @entity5 terror group @entity45 threatened to target the shopping mecca , along with @entity69 in @entity48 and @entity51 's @entity50 shopping corridor
the @entity6 *attracts* 42 million *visitors* per year – more than 8 times the population of @entity85 – and employs 12,000 people
