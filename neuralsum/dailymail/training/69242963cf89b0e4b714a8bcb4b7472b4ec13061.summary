by @entity0 @entity1 have made another enquiry for @entity4 defender @entity3			1
the 29 - year - old @entity5 is valued at £ 20m by the west @entity7 club , but @entity4 could be reluctant to let him go considering the losses they have already suffered in the transfer market			0
@entity4 have already rebuffed one approach by @entity14 's club , but with the departure of @entity16 to @entity17 , @entity1 are keen to get in reinforcements			0
@entity29 , who was on loan at @entity32 's side for the past three seasons , has also moved back to @entity1 , his parent club			2
the prospect of then losing another key player from their title - winning defence would be a bitter one indeed but @entity4 's financial problems are well documented and they could be willing to sell @entity3 , were the right price to come in			0
