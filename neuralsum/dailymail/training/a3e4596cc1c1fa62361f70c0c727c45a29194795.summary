by @entity0 published : 17:56 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 05:45 est , 7 october 2013 @entity1 gave the fraudster cash handouts , tickets to football matches and paid for dinners @entity1 reveals today how he was conned for three years by a fake jockey who he bankrolled in return for racing tips			1
the football manager was introduced to the ‘ promising apprentice ’ one evening at the @entity12 casino @entity13			1
@entity1 tells the story in his autobiography @entity15 , which is serialised in the @entity16 this week			2
in the series he slams the @entity18 as ‘ clueless ’ , tells of his battle to clear his name over tax fraud charges and describes the devastating effect of the case on his wife @entity24			0
the young man at the casino was introduced to him as ‘ @entity27 ’ – the name of a real jockey – and @entity1 , then in charge of @entity32 club @entity31 , recalled how he seemed a ‘ nice kid ’			1
‘ he was n’t dressed too well , looked like he could do with a few quid , but very open and chatty , ’ wrote @entity35			0
‘ if you like a bet , he seemed like a good man to know			0
’ conversation between the pair turned from racing to football and the ‘ jockey ’ told how he ‘ loved @entity31 – the only problem is i can never get a ticket ’			1
but thanks to the generosity of @entity1 , that was about to change			2
‘ suddenly , he was at near enough every home game , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’d ring me up , give me a few tips for horses – they usually got beat – and then arrange to come to the match at the weekend			0
’ ‘ @entity27 ’ would even enjoy games in the directors ’ box at @entity57 and @entity58 – and for one game sat in a private box next to billionaire @entity62 owner @entity61			2
on occasions @entity1 would treat his young friend to dinner and was amazed at how the apprentice , who would need to be at a certain weight in order to meet handicapping requirements , would ‘ tuck into his food ’			1
@entity1 said : ‘ i took him to a lovely @entity73 in @entity62 and he was eating steak and drinking wine and i said , “ @entity27 , how can you eat all this if you ’re riding tomorrow ? ’ ’ and he said , ‘ “ do n’t worry ‘ @entity79			1
i ’ll go for a run at 5am and sweat it all out in the sauna			0
” ’ the former @entity31 manager , pictured at @entity84 , is a keen horse racing fan			1
right , the real @entity27 at one stage , the young man told @entity1 that he had been offered the chance to ride for the famous @entity90 stable in @entity91 where he could win big prize money			1
then he explained that he could not afford the air fare			0
the @entity32 manager lent him £ 500			0
‘ i never saw that again , prize money or not , ’ he recalled			0
after @entity1 left @entity31 and had taken over at @entity97 his jockey friend switched his allegiance and in may this year he had a place in the directors ’ box at @entity102 when @entity97 travelled to play @entity103			1
after the game he said he did not have the train fare to get to the races at @entity84 the next day			0
it has been a turbulent year for @entity1 whose @entity97 team was relegated from the @entity32 in may once again , @entity1 felt sorry for him and bankrolled him with £ 150			2
weeks later @entity1 fielded a call from football agent @entity111 who asked if he was still in touch with his friend ‘ @entity27 ’			1
‘ yeah , he ’s always ringing me , more losers than winners , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ he ’s not @entity27 , ’ said @entity111			2
‘ he ’s a potman at a boozer in @entity120			0
he picks up glasses – he ’s not a f * * * * * * jockey			0
’ @entity1 wrote : ‘ three years he ’d had me			1
the best seat in the house , good restaurants , lifts here , there and everywhere – and heaven knows what in handouts			0
’ ironically , the conman was only found out after he had given @entity111 a ‘ rare , successful ’ tip and the agent happened to be at a @entity134 race meeting where the real @entity27 was riding			1
@entity111 spotted @entity27 standing with his back to him in the paddock			2
he tapped him on the shoulder , introduced himself as ‘ @entity1 ’s mate ’ and thanked him for the winning tip. @entity1 said : ‘ the jockey stared at @entity111 as if he was mad ... then @entity111 began to study the lad ’s face			1
‘ it was n’t the “ @entity27 ” he knew , the one he had met with me at @entity145			1
’ @entity1 said he always regarded himself as streetwise but the fake jockey had been in a ‘ different class ’			1
‘ he was a conman preying on the racing scene and the little rogue had us all			0
’ a spokesman for the real @entity27 , 24 , who has ridden around 100 winners , said he did not wish to comment			1
it has been a turbulent year for @entity1 whose @entity97 team was relegated from the @entity32 in may			2
in february he was cleared of tax fraud at @entity158			0
the case had centred on £ 189,000 in an offshore account he set up in @entity161 .			0
