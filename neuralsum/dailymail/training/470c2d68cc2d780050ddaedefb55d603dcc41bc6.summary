when @entity2 and @entity3 's daughter @entity1 was born eight weeks early , the couple were overcome with shock and worry			1

' he 's always been told growing up of the stories of him when he was a premature baby and his parents going to visit him in hospital for months , ' mrs @entity10 told @entity14			1
@entity3 and @entity10 , from @entity15 in @entity16 , with daughter @entity1 who was born eight weeks early when mr @entity3 was born he was also premature - born three months early due to a condition that causes extremely high blood pressure and can lead to seizures and organ failure ' his dad 's wedding band fit around his thigh			1
' if you 're always told those stories it becomes real when you have a premature baby			0
' mrs @entity10 , 31 , from @entity15 in @entity16 , had a complicated pregnancy because she suffered from the condition placenta previa			1
her placenta totally covered her cervix giving her no way to have a natural delivery			0
' i was sort of in and out of hospital throughout the pregnancy with bleeding and then was already in hospital when i had another episode and they just decided to deliver her at 32 weeks , ' mrs @entity10 said			2
' i 'm the optimist but my husband 's the pessimist and he was just completely scared			0
mrs @entity10 , 31 , had a complicated pregnancy with @entity45 because she suffered from placenta previa when @entity1 was born she had jaundice and had to be placed in a head box to concentrate the oxygen around her so she could breathe ' he was just thinking " are we going to survive this with a baby to take home ? " and it was quite traumatic and scary because it was quite dangerous for us			1
' when @entity1 was born she had jaundice and had to be placed in a head box to concentrate the oxygen around her so she could breathe			2
but mrs @entity10 said the most difficult part of the ordeal was having to leave her precious new daughter at the hospital for 19 nights while she and her husband slept at home			2
' i was allowed to stay for four nights and once i recovered from my caesarean , you know , they ca n't just keep us there to be with our baby , ' she said			0
' it 's a hard thing to explain because you have this beautiful little girl who completes your family , and you 're so excited to meet her and going through all these emotions because you 're absolutely falling in love			0
@entity45 ( left ) was conceived via @entity81 like her older brother @entity82 , two , which mrs @entity10 says makes premature birth more likely @entity45 is now a healthy , happy baby and is about to celebrate her first birthday ' but you 're scared for her too … you have this perfect baby who is just wonderful but you ca n't bring her home			1
' mrs @entity10 says that in terms of premature births , her family was fortunate			2
many do n't survive and if they do they usually have to stay in hospital until the date they were originally due			0

' my husband was in hospital for three months			0
' mrs @entity10 is sharing her family 's story ahead of @entity101 this sunday , to help raise awareness for @entity104 's @entity103 which she says was an important source of support and information following @entity1 's birth			1
mrs @entity10 says that in terms of premature births , her family was fortunate she still does n't know what caused her condition , but she does not believe it was genetic as the reasons for mr @entity3 and @entity45 's premature births were unrelated			1
mrs @entity10 says the fact @entity1 was conceived through @entity81 made her more prone to giving birth prematurely , but her older son @entity117 was also conceived through @entity81 and was born at full term			2
@entity45 is now a healthy , happy baby and is about to celebrate her first birthday			0
' she 's hitting all her milestones , ' mrs @entity10 said			2
