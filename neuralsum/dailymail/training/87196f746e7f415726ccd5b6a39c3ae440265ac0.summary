@entity0 has slammed @entity1 for reacting to @entity3 's ' long - ball @entity5 ' comments - labelling the @entity7 's outburst ' bizarre '			1
the former @entity9 midfielder believes @entity11 , as manager of @entity5 , should have ignored the @entity14 manager 's comments , which were made following the 1 - 1 draw at @entity16 on sunday			1
the 63 - year - old turned up for his press conference ahead of @entity5 's game against @entity20 on wednesday with a four - page dossier , which he insisted dispelled the claims made by @entity3			1
@entity0 ( left ) says @entity1 's reaction to @entity3 's ' long - ball @entity5 ' remark was ' bizarre ' @entity0 , speaking on the @entity26 show , was unimpressed with the @entity5 manager 's reaction the @entity5 manager brandishes part of his dossier as he attempts to prove that @entity5 are not a long - ball side @entity11 looks unimpressed as he tells a packed press conference about his tactics the statistics quoted in the @entity37 pamphlet , which were put together by @entity11 's analysts , claim @entity14 sent a higher percentage of their long passes forward than @entity5 during the match			1
the exact figures showed 71.1 per cent of @entity14 's ' long passes ' - of over 25 metres - went forward whereas @entity5 's percentage was just 49.9 per cent			1
however , @entity0 , speaking on the @entity26 show following @entity46 's win over @entity47 on tuesday night , said there was no need for the @entity5 manager to react			1
he said : ' why would you react to a @entity14 manager , it ’s different if it ’s a rival manager like @entity54 or @entity55 's , but at the end of the day you 're the @entity5 manager			1
' i found it all bizarre to be honest with you , as i felt @entity3 's comments were light - hearted in the first place			1
' @entity14 boss @entity3 labelled @entity1 's side ' long - ball @entity5 ' following sunday 's 1 - 1 draw @entity11 was clearly annoyed at @entity3 's comments and he had the pamphlet on his desk waiting when he fielded the first question about the @entity14 manager 's jibe the former @entity70 boss insisted his team only started launching balls forward after 6ft 4in @entity73 came on in the 76th minute of the draw against @entity14 the 63 - year - old hands the pages of his dossier to journalists during tuesday 's press conference this sheet suggests @entity5 had a 56 per cent success rate of their 41 ' long and forward ' passes during the match at @entity14			1
the blue arrows indicate a successful pass @entity0 later went on to question @entity11 's decision to deploy @entity87 in midfield rather than as a striker this season , as well as expressing his disappointment at the level of @entity5 's performances			1
he added : ‘ it ’s not great to watch - put it that way			0
i 've heard @entity11 say recently that @entity5 ca n't take risks , but what message does that send to the fans ? ' it ’s all about taking risks as a @entity5 player and having the balls and tenacity to go out and attack the opposition			2
@entity14 made just 11 of their 32 ' long and forward ' passes during the match , according to boss @entity11 @entity11 claims @entity5 made 49.9 per cent of ' long passes forward ' in comparison to @entity14 's 71 per cent @entity11 freely admits that @entity5 played more long balls when @entity73 was introduced when a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then , yeah , you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context i believe			1
i think the media is also coming to the match and you have a lot of opinion about me , or the game , or the players and now you say that you have no opinion			0
when you have 0 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls ? yeah , long balls , in the width , to switch the play			0
you have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls , but long balls wide , rather than to the striker			0
a ball to the forward striker is mainly caused by long - ball play			2
because i expected this question , i have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then i have to say that it is not a good interpretation from @entity3			2
it is not so difficult also to read that			0
i am sorry , but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed , in spite of many chances in the second half , then i changed my playing style			0
then , of course , with the quality of @entity73 we played more forward balls and we scored from that , so i think it was a very good decision of the manager			0
but , when you see overall the long ball , and what is the percentage of that , then @entity14 have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49			2
so , i give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult , which is why i began with the explanation of ball possession			0
when you have 60 per cent ball possession you can not play long balls			0
so again , they did it 71 and we 49 , and i give it you , you can copy it and then maybe you can go to @entity3 and he will get a good interpretation			0
' they 're ( the fans ) used to watching @entity5 teams that play high intensity football and score plenty of goals - and that just has n't happened this season			0
‘ the two centre forwards - whoever has been playing up there in different games this season - have not been good enough either			0
‘ he ( @entity87 ) scores goals , creates them and gives endless amounts of energy - this is @entity87 - how many goals has he scored for @entity5 and @entity9 ? ' he 's wasted in midfield or on the wing , he 's got to be playing upfront			2

@entity0 says @entity1 's *pre-match* press conference on tuesday was ' bizarre '
the @entity5 manager hit back at claims made by @entity3 after the draw at @entity14 that the @entity199 are a long - ball side
@entity3 suggested @entity5 deployed long - ball tactics during the game
but @entity11 turned up at the press conference on tuesday with four sheets of @entity37 paper which , he claims , *rubbishes* @entity3 's theory
@entity0 , though , was unimpressed with @entity11 's comments
