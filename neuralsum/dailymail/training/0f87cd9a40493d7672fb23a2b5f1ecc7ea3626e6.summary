according to a source close to the couple , who have just returned from a sun - filled getaway in @entity14 with their beloved daughter , @entity1 is threatening to move into the spare room of the couple 's luxurious home in @entity20 , @entity21 because he is so fed up with the situation			1
' @entity0 is a bit too protective when it comes to their baby and @entity1 has insisted that she needs to get an expert to help sleep train @entity6 , ' the source revealed to @entity30			1
' it is causing a fair amount of friction			0
' a second source added : ' @entity0 is incredibly protective of the baby and loves having her sleeping in her bed			1
@entity1 is slightly less tolerant of the situation			0

a host of other celebrity mothers , from @entity79 and @entity80 to @entity81 and @entity82 , have all spoken out in favour of co-sleeping with their children			0

' it ’s probably why i work as hard as i do - i do n’t want to look back and see the things i did n’t do			0
' according to parenting expert @entity108 , many mothers find it hard to leave their babies in a separate room at night , particularly when the baby is having trouble sleeping , and tends to wake crying at regular intervals			1
however , @entity108 warned that @entity0 and @entity1 need to try and tackle the issue as soon as possible - or risk @entity6 developing into an overly dependent toddler			1
' it 's really tough when you have a baby that does n't sleep well , ' she told @entity30			1
' and as the baby is ten months old then they really need to change things , otherwise they are going to have a dependent toddler , as they have set themselves up for being in demand 24/7			2
' @entity108 suggested that the devoted parents start to implement a few smaller changes in their day - to - day routine , before trying to sleep separately from @entity6 , in order to make their daughter feel as happy and comfortable as possible			1
' they need to get the baby into a flexible , natural routine , ' she added			2
' at ten months a baby would naturally need a nap every two and a half hours , and they would be having between two and three milk feeds and three meals a day			0
time to make a change : sleep expert @entity108 suggested that @entity0 and @entity1 , pictured in @entity141 with daughter @entity6 , start trying to put their daughter down for naps in her own room @entity145 boots get them in black at @entity149 visit site she ’s a doting mom and needs to hit her style high spot without sacrificing on comfort so she can run around after her babe all day			1

' [ @entity0 ] still needs to nurture her baby , [ give her ] cuddles and meet her baby 's @entity200 issue is that if she is still having their baby in the bed , this can really take its toll on relationships , and @entity206 gets relegated to the spare room			1
' [ that ] should send warning bells that maybe things should change			0
and she can still nature her baby [ without needing to sleep with her ]			0
' and while some might accuse @entity1 of being insensitive to the needs of his wife and daughter , @entity108 insists that issues like this can be especially hard on the fathers			2
' i think it 's really tough for dads , especially if it 's been ten months of sharing their bed , ' she said			0
' he still needs to feel part of a family rather than it being mummy and baby and then him			0
' he would need to support her to make the changes - she still needs help to feed the baby and help to get the baby to sleep - but in in separate space			2
