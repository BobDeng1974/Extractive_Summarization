by @entity0 last updated at 12:20 pm on 5th november 2011 @entity1 was jailed for two years last july but who has now been freed a scout leader jailed for sexually assaulting an 11 - year - old girl on a camping trip is appealing to the @entity6 to be taken off the @entity7 claiming it breaches his human rights			1
@entity1 , who was jailed for two years last july but who has now been freed , said that being on the list was making his life ' a misery ' and made it ' almost impossible ' to go on holiday and see friends			1
the 51 - year - old has written to the court in @entity18 in a bid to have his name taken off the register			1
there are around 30,000 perverts on the @entity7 , which monitors the activity of convicted sex offenders and tries to ensure they can not commit crimes again again			1
in his letter to the court , @entity1 states that the register is ' draconian ' and that it is making it hard for him to go on holiday or visit friends			1
he said he has to continue reporting to a local police station at least once a year to sign the register and said the police can visit his house unannounced at any time			2
@entity1 said at each visit photographs and other details like his national insurance number and car registration are taken			1
letter : mr @entity1 has written to the @entity6 in @entity18 to have his name taken off the register he wrote : ' being on the register also means that every time i leave the country for work or holiday , for more than three days , i have to go to the police station and give them full details of my visit including the destination address and length of stay			1
' also if i am to visit friends or family within the @entity59 and my aggregate stay anywhere is more than seven days , again i have to register that address with the police			2
i would like to appeal against one of the most draconian pieces of legislation being implemented in @entity59 , which is the ‘ sex offenders register ’			2
being on the sex offenders register means that even after finishing my full sentence , i will have to continue reporting to a local police station at least once a year to sign the register and / or the police can visit my house unannounced any time of their choosing			2
at each visit my photographs and other details like my national insurance number and my car ’s registration number are also taken			2
being on the register also means that every time i leave the country for work or holiday , for more than three days , i have to go to the police station and give them full details of my visit including the destination address and length of stay , also if i am to visit friends or family within the @entity59 and my aggregate stay anywhere is more than seven days , again i have to register that address with the police			2
in other words u have to register the details of my friends and family as well who have not committed any crime			0
this makes me seriously wonder that would most of my friends and family would want to keep ties with me knowing that their names and addresses are going to be on a police register as part of the sex offenders register			0
i strongly believe that keeping me on the @entity7 is in serious breach of not just mine but my family ’s human rights , fundamental freedoms , freedom of movement and @entity117 to respect for private and family life			1
it also prevents us from returning to any kind of normal life after doing my sentence and paying my penance			0
being on the sex offenders register is just like getting out of a smaller prison and then living the rest of your life in a bigger prison			0
i would be grateful for your intervention to have my name removed from the @entity59 sex offenders register			0
' in other words you have to register the details of my friends and family as well who have not committed any crime			0
' this makes me seriously wonder that would most of my friends and family would want to keep ties with me knowing that their names and addresses are going to be on a police register as part of the sex offenders register			0
' in the letter , also published in @entity149 , he added : ' i strongly believe that keeping me on the @entity7 is in serious breach of not just mine but my family 's human rights , fundamental freedoms , freedom of movement and right to respect for private and family life			1
' it also prevents us from returning to any kind of normal life after doing my sentence and paying my penance			0
' @entity165 @entity164 heard in july last year how @entity1 was arrested after he reported the girl he had sexually abused after she contacted him and told him she would go to the police if he did n't give her money to keep quiet			1
when police interviewed the girl , who was 19 last year , on suspicion of blackmail they discovered the truth and arrested @entity1 at his home in @entity175 , south @entity176			1
the girl told them that @entity1 had repeatedly sexually assaulted her during a summer outing in 2002 when she was just 11			1
forcing her to perform sexual acts on him			0
@entity1 admitted two counts of gross indecency with a child , two indecent assaults and breach of trust and was jailed for two years and banned from being in the company of children under the age of 16 last july			1
he was also put on the @entity7 for 10 years			0
recorder @entity190 , in sentencing the pervert , told him : ' the sentence will bring your career and your work in the community to an end			0
' i accept it was you who stopped the contact			0
it was a reflection on the mess you made of your life			0
' but you should never ever have done that to a little girl			0
