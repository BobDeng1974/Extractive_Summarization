the last four inmates on death row in @entity4 will live out their final days in prison , the state 's governor ruled wednesday ( left , @entity21 and right , @entity34 ) news of their changed penalties comes more than one year after outgoing @entity7 leader @entity6 scrapped the death penalty in @entity4 ( left , @entity40 and right , @entity19 , @entity20 ) the governor 's office argued the sanction does not deter crime , can not be administered without racial bias and costs three times more than maintaining a prisoner for life			1
policy makers also highlighted that a mistake can not be reversed if an innocent person is put to death by lethal injection , electrocution , firing squad , hanging , or gas chamber			0
@entity6 ruled that capital punishment in @entity4 would be replaced with a sentence of life without parole			0
since this change came into play , there have been ongoing arguments over what to do with the remaining death row inmates			2
@entity6 noted in a statement wednesday that outgoing @entity7 attorney general @entity67 recently asserted that carrying out prior sentences would be illegal in the absence of an existing statute			1
' the question at hand is whether any public good is served by allowing these essentially un-executable sentences to stand , ' @entity6 said			2
the governor 's office argued the punishment does not deter crime , can not be administered without racial bias and costs a considerable amount ' in my judgment , leaving these death sentences in place does not serve the public good of the people of @entity4 - present or future			1
' the governor said he had met or spoken with many of the relatives of the people killed by the inmates , and he thanked them for talking with him about the cases			0
but he said that his failing to act at this point in the legal process would ' needlessly and callously subject survivors , and the people of @entity4 , to the ordeal of an endless appeals process , with unpredictable twists and turns , and without any hope of finality or closure			0
' @entity17 , @entity18 was sentenced to death together with drug kingpin @entity19 in 1984 for the 1983 murders of @entity106 and his sister - in - law , @entity107			2
@entity16 @entity15 received the same penalty in 1996 for the double murder of seniors @entity111 and @entity112			0
and lastly , @entity21 was convicted two years later for the robbery and murder of @entity115			0
the four men have submitted various pleas over the years in a bid to get their sentences altered			0
the latest ruling will no doubt divide opinion , however many have have congratulated @entity6 's ' progressive stance ' on the matter .			0
