archaeologists have disproved popular preconceptions that the rich dined on imported delicacies including flamingo , while the poor survived on gruel , by revealing that all classes of people enjoyed a rich and varied diet			0
the researchers discovered sea urchin and the butchered leg of a giraffe among less exotic foods like grain and eggs , in a poorer area of the ruined city			2

a drain from a central property in the district revealed a rich variety of foods as well as imports from outside @entity64 , such as shellfish , sea urchin and even delicacies including the butchered leg joint of a giraffe			0
archaeologists said their finds prove the richness , variety and range of a non-elite diet as well as the long - distance trade in exotic and wild animals at the time			1
the international team of researchers spent more than a decade analysing the homes , shops and businesses of a lower to middle class district in the @entity3 city , where earlier buildings date back to the 6th century			1
the area covers 10 separate building plots and a total of 20 shop fronts , most of which served food and drink			0
archaeologists examined waste in drains as well as 10 accident latrines and cesspits to discover charred food waste from kitchens , including fully - process foods like grain , as well as human waste			2
@entity30 , an associate professor of classics at the @entity32 , said : ‘ the material from the drains revealed a range and quantity of materials to suggest a rather clear socio - economic distinction between the activities and consumption habits of each property , which were otherwise indistinguishable hospitality businesses			1

‘ that the bone represents the height of exotic food is underscored by the fact that this is thought to be the only giraffe bone ever recorded from an archaeological excavation in @entity64 , ’ professor @entity30 said			0
‘ how part of the animal , butchered , came to be a kitchen scrap in a seemingly standard @entity131 restaurant not only speaks to long - distance trade in exotic and wild animals , but also something of the richness , variety and range of a non-elite diet			1
’ deposits discovered also included imported spices from as far away as @entity171 , highlight the incredible reach of the @entity3			0
‘ the traditional vision of some mass of hapless lemmings – scrounging for whatever they can pinch from the side of a street , or huddled around a bowl of gruel – needs to be replaced by a higher fare and standard of living , at least for the urbanites in @entity5 , ’ professor @entity30 said			0
exotic delicacies discovered : while inexpensive food such as grains , fruit , nuts and eggs were found , the archaeologists also found rich foods including sea urchin ( illustrated left ) and the leg of a giraffe in the drain of a property in a relatively poor part of the @entity3 city one of the deposits dates to the 4th century and is rare since few other deposits survived the early stage in the development of @entity5			1
professor @entity30 and his international team aim to reveal the structural and social relationships over time between working - class @entity131 households , as well as to work out the role that the middle classes played in shaping the city			2
‘ however , one of the larger datasets and themes of our research has been diet and the infrastructure of food consumption and food ways , ’ he added			0
the research will be presented at the joint annual meeting of the @entity222 ( @entity222 ) and @entity223 ( @entity223 ) in @entity224 this weekend			0
professor @entity30 , who led the research , believes it disproves traditional views that the poor and middle classes living in @entity5 ( pictured ) were ' hapless lemmings ' who scrounged for scraps of food or survived on gruel			2

archeologists led by the @entity32 said the discoveries of exotic meats prove the richness , variety and range of a non-elite diet
the international team of researchers spent more than a decade analysing the homes , shops and businesses of a non-elite district in @entity5
inexpensive food , such as grains , fruits , nuts , olives , local fish , small cuts of meat and eggs were also found in latrines and drains in the area
