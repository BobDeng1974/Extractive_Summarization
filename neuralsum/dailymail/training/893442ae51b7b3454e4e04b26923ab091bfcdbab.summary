@entity0 is entering what could well be the final weeks of his managerial career			1
after six weeks of sustained defeats , the boardroom tittering at @entity4 is becoming more pronounced and a decision whether to cut short their relationship is drawing near			2
@entity0 watched his side lose their fourth game on the bounce when the well - organised , albeit limited , @entity12 scored twice in five minutes to stretch their hosts ’ winless run to eight			1
@entity4 manager @entity0 issues instructions to his side during their home defeat to @entity12 on saturday one fan shows her support to @entity0 with a flag dedicated to the under pressure @entity4 boss that includes an @entity25 humbling at @entity26 last week , as well as an alarming zero points from two games against @entity29			1
they have won just twice since september 17			0
talk is growing louder that owner @entity32 is growing restless			1
it is a sorry state of affairs for a man whose popularity at the @entity36 should not wane because of a gamble that has not paid off			0
for @entity0 , @entity4 represents his last chance at building a career as a no 1			1
there would be no coming back if he were to be potted so soon in surroundings he should thrive in			0
‘ in myself , yes , ’ @entity0 said when asked if he believed he would still be in charge next week			2
‘ i do n’t make that judgment call but the one thing this football club needs is togetherness			0
' any manager would be disappointed not to be given the time they need to finish a job , but if you ’re asking me whether i ’m very disappointed at this moment in time , yes , i am			2
forest fans show their support to former player and now manager @entity0 during saturday 's game @entity0 looks anxious as he watches his side crash out of the @entity61 to @entity62 in september the @entity26 players celebrate with @entity64 after his penalty gave the hosts a @entity25 win over @entity4 ‘ all eyes are on me , whether it ’s the media , the boardroom , the players , the supporters			1
i have to be rock solid and i can tell you i wo n’t be buckling , and the players have to take strength from me			0
’ @entity0 is idolised for playing glories - he spent 12 emotional years at the club - and that , quite rightly , will never change			1
but regardless of the past , those who control @entity4 need to stick or twist - and let their fanbase know why			1
it is not as if they have n’t been supportive			0
yes , there were issues surrounding the sales and subsequent loans of @entity86 and @entity87 to @entity88 , but @entity0 was given in the region of £ 9million in the summer			2
@entity4 owner @entity32 could sack @entity0 if results do not improve on the field quickly @entity93 , pictured here scoring against @entity94 in september , cost @entity4 around £ 5million half of that was spent on @entity98 striker @entity97 ; the idea was that this was an appointment for the long haul			1
unfortunately such grand gestures can not legislate for the results they are enduring			0
something has to give , but nobody around the club is wholly sure what			0
@entity0 points towards a lengthy injury list as reason why they have fallen 10 points behind the play - offs , while others suggest his tactics and inability to get the best of out of his substitutions			1
as ever , the truth lies somewhere in between			0
the supporters are now split			0
they are all willing the 52 - year - old to do well and some assert that six months simply is n’t long enough to garner which direction this will eventually head			2
others do not afford @entity0 that sentiment			2
after waiting the best part of three years to at least show signs of competing at this level , the facts remain that results are not good enough and performances are lethargic			0
and any discussions as to whether @entity4 should part ways with a sixth permanent manager in three seasons will doubtless take into consideration mistakes of the past , including @entity139 ’s farcical three - month reign			1
they are a club craving stability , but at what point do you draw the line and cut your losses ? pursuing a strong figurehead who assimilates what the club stands for is laudable - @entity4 clearly went into this with the best of intentions - but they ’ve picked the wrong man			1
next up for @entity4 is a trip to promotion - chasing @entity155 , a fixture former manager @entity156 ( above ) was sacked after on the back of a 5 - 0 thumping back in march @entity159 , @entity156 and now @entity0 might have appeared the right fits at the time but football has moved on without them			1
it should not be overlooked that @entity0 had n’t been in club management for seven years prior to his homecoming and it ’s showed			2
@entity167 reported last week that @entity32 took the unusual step of seeking counsel from first - team players over the former @entity173 international ’s management style			1
‘ we are trying to imitate @entity176 at a lower level , ’ the owner said last month			2
he was at the game on saturday and may have to revise that statement following an afternoon where @entity4 managed just three shots on target			1
the word crisis is one banded about far too easily - they are nowhere near that state at present - although those at the top are twitching			0
what lies ahead at the @entity189 on saturday should bring matters to a head			0
@entity156 was sacked after losing 5 - 0 against @entity155 back in march ; the same fate may befall his successor if another east @entity196 embarrassment is dished up by @entity139 and co. in a way , it ’d be somewhat fitting			1
good week for ... @entity199 now out of the @entity201 relegation zone , @entity199 are on a four - match unbeaten run for the first time since the backend of last season			0
they have also managed to renew the loans of @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 until the end of the campaign			0
@entity199 boss @entity214 will be pleased to have seen his side move out of the @entity201 relegation zone bad week for ... @entity216 another defeat - this time at the hands of @entity223 ’s @entity220 - meant the @entity221 called time on @entity222 ’ tenure as manager			2
hardly surprising , really , given they ’ve got steadily worse throughout the season			0
@entity222 might ’ve even taken them down			0
@entity222 walks off the pitch at the final whistle for the final time at @entity216 boss after defeat to @entity220 @entity233 : @entity234 ( @entity235 ) might have come to the attention this weekend because of his opening goal in the 4 - 0 win against @entity239 , but @entity234 has been a steady performer at wing - back for the @entity241 and helped @entity243 ’s side become the meanest defence in @entity201			1
@entity234 celebrates after his goal gave @entity201 leaders @entity235 the lead against @entity239			0

@entity4 are without a win in eight games in all *competitions*
@entity253 appears to be running out for manager @entity0
a 2 - 0 defeat at home to @entity258 *wednesday* on saturday has seen the pressure increase on the former @entity4 player even more
owner @entity32 has had *reservations* over the playing style
the @entity265 lie 13th in the @entity267 points off the play - offs
