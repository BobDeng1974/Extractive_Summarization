by @entity0 published : 08:49 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 06:42 est , 13 august 2012 a disinfectant that is harmless to humans but deadly to superbugs is poised to become the latest weapon against hospital infections			2
the germ - destroying product called @entity7 , works at low concentrations according to a study from the @entity10 in @entity11			1
researchers tested the compound against bacterial spores of @entity15 that attach to surfaces and are difficult to destroy			2
cleaning : bacteria found in hospitals can survive on surfaces for long periods of time previous work by the group has shown @entity7 is also effective at low concentrations against strains of @entity27 and e coli			1
@entity29 - forming bacteria including @entity15 and @entity27 can survive on surfaces for long periods of time			2
spores are heat - tolerant and can continue for a number of years in a dehydrated state before they are reactivated			0
most chemical disinfectants control or prevent spore growth rather than irreversibly destroying them			0
the latest study showed that @entity39 was able to destroy @entity41 bacterial spores , suspended in water and attached to stainless steel or glass surfaces , at concentrations well below one per cent after just 90 seconds ' treatment			1
it was equally as effective at more dilute concentrations ( below 0.1 per cent ) if left to act for longer periods			1
lead researcher dr @entity50 , explained the advantages over other chemical compounds currently used against bacterial spores			0
' most disinfectants have to be applied at much higher concentrations – typically between 4 - 10 per cent - to properly get rid of bacterial spores			1
' unfortunately such high levels of these compounds may also be harmful to humans and other animals			0
@entity7 is non-corrosive , non-irritable , odourless and is effective at very low concentrations , ' he said			1
' bacterial spores demonstrate a remarkable resistance to physical and chemical agents as well as ordinary antiseptics			0
on top of this micro-organisms are becoming increasingly resistant to disinfectants as well as antibiotics			0
' our latest study shows @entity7 is effective at destroying these spores as well as bacteria that are known problems in healthcare environments			1
' the product is produced by @entity78 , which is based in @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity11			0
the study is reported online in the @entity82 .			0

*scientists* said @entity39 was non-irritable , odourless and effective at ' low concentrations '
