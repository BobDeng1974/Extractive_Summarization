by @entity0 and @entity1 former @entity3 gov @entity2 took the witness stand this week in his official corruption trial			1
pictured above arriving at the courthouse on friday , august 22 after former @entity2 @entity2 took the witness stand in his public corruption trial , a narrative worthy of a nighttime soap opera got even juicier			1
@entity2 currently faces charges he performed ' official acts ' to benefit star scientific ceo @entity13 , a man who appears to have had an emotional affair with @entity2 's wife @entity15			1
more details of the high - profile couple 's relationship were revealed in court on friday , when the defense introduced @entity2 's melancholic letter to his ‘ soulmate , ’ professing his love for her and gratitude for their life together , apologizing for his shortcomings , calling her out for hers , and begging her to work with him to save the marriage			1
‘ i am lonely sometimes , ’ @entity2 wrote on @entity32 2011			1
‘ i want to be in love , not just watch movies about it			1
’ he was not specific about his faults , but clear about hers : ‘ i am so spiritually and mentally exhausted from being yelled at			1
i do n't think you realize how you are affecting me and sometimes others with your tongue			1
’ jurors and everyone following the story that has dominated front pages across @entity3 for four weeks had already heard how his wife , @entity15 , had turned the stately and seemingly serene @entity46 into a house of workplace horrors with her incessant yelling at employees			1
they also heard how she sought the attentions of a slick vitamin entrepreneur while her husband was away or preoccupied with his job			2
then the man once widely considered a possible running mate for @entity58 presidential aspirant @entity57 told his story , laying bare the most intimate details of his personal life			2
and there were other revelations from his testimony : he got in the habit of working late to avoid going home and dealing with his wife 's rage			1
he moved out of the family home and into the rectory of a @entity73 for the duration of the trial for much the same reason			2
he had no idea how tight his wife and the vitamin guy , @entity13 , had become and was ‘ hurt ’ to learn they had exchanged 950 phone calls and text messages			1
but neither @entity2 nor any of the other witnesses believed the relationship was sexual — and @entity13 had testified that it was not			1
scroll down for full letter @entity87 : at trial this week , a private letter sent from @entity89 to his wife @entity15 ( in red ) was revealed , in which he reaches out to her to repair their broken relationship			1
mrs @entity95 pictured leaving the federal courthouse on friday affair : @entity2 stands accused of performing ' official acts ' to benefit @entity13 ( left )			1
but his defense team is arguing that he did not conspire with his wife @entity15 ( right ) because they were n't communicating			1
so far , it appears @entity15 was having an emotional affair with @entity13 the marital discord is a key element of the defense as the @entity106 fight charges that they performed ‘ official acts ’ to benefit @entity13 , the @entity109 ceo who showered them with more than $ 165,000 in gifts , trips and loans			1
the theory is that the @entity106 could not have conspired because they were barely communicating			2
to illustrate the point , @entity2 said his wife did n't even respond to his letter pleading for reconciliation			1
defense attorneys had prepped the jury for @entity2 's woebegone testimony by calling a parade of former @entity95 associates who portrayed her as petulant , suspicious , secretive , manipulative , accusatory and prone to angry outbursts			1
from : @entity2 sent : mon 9/05/2011 12:54 pm ( gmt -4 ) to : @entity127 subject : ( no subject ) i love you			1

i love being married to you and having a family			1
we have shared much good life together			2
i have made plenty of mistakes in my life which i wish i could fix			2
i am so sorry for all the times i have not been there for you and have done things to hurt you			2
i know i am a sinner and keep trying to do better			2
but i am completely at a loss as to how to handle the fiery anger and hate from you that has become more and more frequent			2
you told me again yesterday that you would wreck my things and how bad i am			2
it hurt me to my core			2
i have asked and prayed to @entity154 so many times to take this anger away from you and heal whatever hurt is causing it ...			2
some going back years and years			2
he has not yet answered those prayers			2
i often lie awake at night thinking what i can do to try to make things better			0
i admit that i do keep away from you sometimes and do n't talk to you about important things or problems to avoid confrontation			0
my whole life is spent trying to help my family and other people			0
overall i am incredibly blessed to lead the life we have lead , and you are too			0
more great children , good jobs , material comforts and friends than most people ever have			0
i fight to continue to be humble and thankful for all @entity154 has done			0
l was very excited about this weekend to spend 3 days with you to do what we wanted			0
we started tough friday night but we agreed to a reset			0
i wanted yesterday to show we could work together			0
i planned to open gifts , walk to the river with you , talk to you ( like you did when you bared your sweet soul a little about your childhood on the @entity190 trip this summer ) read , watch a movie and catch up on personal business			1
somehow the best plans with us never work out			0
it makes me very sad			0
i want to be in love , not just watch movies about it			1
you are doing a really great job as first lady ... better than any i 've seen and better than you probably expected as you were nervous taking the @entity202 job			0
l 'm so proud of your public actions			0
our private life though has great heartache			0
you tell me all the time how bad your life has been with me and how unhappy you are			0
l do not understand this			0
i am so spiritually and mentally exhausted from being yelled at			0
i do n't think you realize how you are affecting me and sometimes others with your tongue			0
as you told me many times and bought the book , " do n't sweat the samll stuff '			0
and everything is small stuff ( @entity218 )			0
i beg of you to think about conflict resolution in a peaceful manner			0
ironically that was the focus of the readings at @entity223 and @entity224 homily yesterday			0
there is no problem we ca n't work out if we are calm and talk nicely and respect each others position			0
i am not preaching ! l love you and want to help make you happy and our family endure			1
i will do anything possible to try to fix our marriage if you will work with me			0
today i will spend on the many tasks i need to do : working on dads estate ( sad ) , paying bills , 2010 taxes , student loans , getting our files in order , letters to kids , sandbridge properties , etc. and taking at least a little time to read something for my soul ! l know you work hard too to run a good office			1
let me know if you want to talk softly			0
@entity2 sent from my @entity248 it 's a character portrait that could bolster the notion that @entity15 schemed behind her husband 's back to solicit most of the gifts and loans , and engender sympathy for the former governor			1
but it also could backfire , said @entity259 law professor @entity258 , who specializes in criminal procedure and evidence			0
‘ it 's a strategy that 's fraught with danger , ’ he said			1
‘ normally doing something unchivalrous like throwing your wife under the bus does n't play very well with regular people , which is what you have with a jury			1
’ nevertheless , the former governor could beat at least some of the charges in the 14 - count indictment if he is convincing enough , @entity258 said			0
@entity276 is n't on the jury and has n't been in court , but the 34 - year - old @entity279 resident said he has been following the case closely and believes @entity2 is guilty of nothing more than using poor judgment			1
supporter : @entity2 pictured leaving court with his daughter @entity284 on friday ‘ it seems like his wife has expensive taste and is a little greedy , ’ @entity276 said friday as he stopped by a suburban coffee shop			1
‘ i think it 's more on her shoulders than his			1
’ @entity276 said he feels some sympathy for the former governor , and he believes the jury might too			0
@entity296 , 59 , of @entity279 also has kept up with the daily news reports			0
he said that while @entity2 could get some sympathy from jurors , the former governor is getting none from him			1
‘ they absolutely should be convicted , ’ @entity296 said			0
‘ it does n't absolve them of guilt because their marriage was falling apart			0
’ before the former governor took the stand , prosecutors had tried to discredit the marital discord theory by pointing out frequent hand - holding and other public displays of affection by the @entity106			0
they will get a chance to tackle the issue head on when they cross-examine @entity2 , perhaps as soon as monday .			1
