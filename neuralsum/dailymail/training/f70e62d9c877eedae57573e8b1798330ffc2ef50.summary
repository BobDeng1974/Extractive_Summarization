by @entity0 @entity2 levels are slowly rebuilding inside @entity3 , a volcano in @entity4 around 100 miles south of @entity5 , that erupted in 1980 and killed 57 people the roughly 8,300 - foot volcano erupted in an explosion of hot ash and gas on may 18 , 1980 , spewing debris over some 230 square miles and causing more than a billion dollars in property damage			1
@entity14 scientists say there is no sign of an impending eruption and the volcano has been quiet in recent years			1
looking out : recent analysis of @entity3 shows that the volcano remains active and has accumulated additional magma , but there are no signs of an impending eruption entire forests were crushed and river systems altered in the blast , which began with a 5.2 magnitude earthquake			1
within minutes , the north face of the symmetrical peak collapsed , spewing volcanic ash and unleashing rivers of hot mud and scorching pumice that obliterated everything in their path			2
the violent eruption lasted nine hours , causing catastrophic damage to the surrounding area and claiming 57 lives			2
' the magma reservoir beneath @entity3 has been slowly re-pressurizing since 2008 , ' the @entity42 said in a statement on wednesday			1
monitoring : since the end of the 2004 - 2008 eruptions at @entity3 , scientists at the @entity46 and the @entity47 have been monitoring the subtle inflation of the ground surface and minor earthquakes ' it is likely that re-pressurization is caused by ( the ) arrival of a small amount of additional magma 4 to 8 km ( 2.5 to 5 miles ) beneath the surface			1
' the @entity42 said this is to be expected with an active volcano and does not indicate ' the volcano is likely to erupt anytime soon			0
' helicopter pilot @entity61 recalls flying into the volcano before it erupted in 2004			1
he says the volcano is monitored by @entity65 and seismic systems as well as other sensors that tracks carbon dioxide and thermal temperatures			0
' i flew into the crater and noticed the same area we had landed the previous day was fractured			0
it was a startling and troubling observation , ' @entity61 told @entity75			0
discovery : this photo of a simmering @entity3 was taken five weeks before the may 1980 eruption ' the monitoring stations measured a deformation in the flanks of the volcano as the magma was raising to the surface			1
not long after that , the volcano erupted			0
' ' this is giving long - term ( data ) that it 's getting ready to erupt again , but it could be decades before it does something again , " @entity87 said			0
" it 's getting ready , but it 's not there			0
the reassuring thing is : when it 's really ready to erupt , it gives lots and lots of signs			2
' the @entity42 , and the @entity47 at @entity100 , closely monitor ground deformation and seismicity at the volcano			2
this summer , they will also measure its released gases and gravity field , measurements that can be used to monitor subsurface magma and forecast eruptions .			0

there are no signs of an impending volcanic eruption on @entity3
ever since the *sudden* *reawakening* of @entity3 in 2004 , scientists have been monitoring the volcano closely
@entity2 reservoir beneath @entity3 has been slowly re-pressurizing since 2008
re-pressurization of a volcano 's magma reservoir can continue many years without an eruption
