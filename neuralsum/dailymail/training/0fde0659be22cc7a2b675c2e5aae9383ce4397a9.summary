by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a father who saw his son fatally shot by @entity6 police on live television has filed a $ 20 million wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against the city			1
the suit filed on behalf of parents @entity12 and @entity14 on thursday alleges officers violated the @entity16 and state law when they fatally shot @entity18 , 51 , who was unarmed			1
@entity12 , an injured veteran , was shot on december 13 after police officers pursued him for nearly an hour for allegedly reckless driving			1
the chase ended when his @entity22 hit a car in an intersection , seriously injuring the other driver , and then spun onto a downtown sidewalk			2
the lawsuit alleges that officers were inadequately trained , used excessive force and committed battery and negligence			1
it states that the shooting is the ' fruit of the @entity34 's longstanding unconstitutional customs and practices with respect to the use of deadly force ' and criticized the department for a rising number of police shootings recently with little consequence for most officers			1
' this has contributed to a culture of impunity , subject to which officers believe that they can open fire without consequences , ' it states			2
killed : footage shows the moment that @entity12 exited his car before he was shot multiple times by cops @entity72 : police had chased his car for nearly an hour and claimed he had been driving erratically @entity6 police @entity74			1
@entity76 said the department does n't comment on pending litigation			0
chief @entity79 said in a statement in december that he was ' very concerned ' after reading a preliminary report on the shooting			0
@entity79 has placed three officers on leave until the investigation ends , when they may receive discipline or further training			2
after the shooting last year , @entity29 said that he had turned on the tv after his panicked son called him while on the case			1
he insisted he had done nothing wrong			0
' pull over , ' @entity29 told his son , ' he said he was going to do it , but he did n't do it			1
' he then watched in horror as the crash and shooting unfolded - initially thinking he son has only been hit by a @entity100 gun			2
crash : the chase only came to a stop when he hit another car , pictured			0
the driver suffered injuries ' i just ca nâ€™t seem to get over this , ' he said			0
he added that his son suffered from severe paranoia after brain tumor surgery that caused him to be discharged from the military - a condition that fueled his impulse to speed away			1
attorney @entity115 , who is representing @entity12 's parents , said the shooting is indicative of a larger problem nationally that needs to be addressed			0
@entity115 said there have been more than 10,000 police shootings in @entity121 over the last 30 years but ' not one criminal prosecution of a police officer for a shooting			0
and that is why many members of the public think the system is unfair			0
' he added : ' if anyone other than a police officer had done that shooting ( of @entity133 ) that would be first - degree murder			0
they would be in jail without bail			0

@entity18 , an injured veteran who reportedly suffered from paranoia , was shot multiple times following a high - speed chase last year
he had called his father , @entity29 , to insist he had done nothing wrong and when the older man *switched* on tv , he saw his son being shot
his lawsuit alleges the officers were not properly trained and used excessive force in the *tragedy*
