1/4 @entity0 , 11/4 @entity1 , 50/1 @entity2 , 80/1 @entity3 selected odds supplied by @entity5 - correct at time of publication @entity1 and @entity0 are set for a @entity8 showdown after personal triumph this year			1
while @entity1 clinched his second world championship title in @entity11 on sunday , @entity0 claimed the @entity12 and @entity13			1
he just hits the ball , he does n’t need the car			0
@entity1 has been terrific and i listened to him clinch the title while driving home , with some outstanding radio on @entity33			1
he did n’t win the award last time he was world champion and i fear he will miss out again			0
there seems to be a disconnect with the @entity38 public , but he is doing everything he can to change that			0
@entity41 , chief sports reporter - @entity0 @entity0			1
credit to @entity1 for securing a second world title but you ca n't ignore the fact that he 's won a two - horse race this season			1
@entity0 , however , has now proved himself the world 's finest golfer			1
an amazing year for him			0
@entity51 - @entity1 both are great sportsmen but only one wants to be known as @entity38 and , despite living in his second tax haven , that man is @entity1			1
@entity0 , by declaring himself @entity56 for @entity58 purposes , should not be handed a @entity38 bauble			1
@entity0 is all smiles as he lifts the @entity61 after winning the @entity62 at @entity63 in july @entity1 celebrates his second world championship triumph after clinching victory in @entity11 @entity66 - @entity0 it has to be @entity0			1
so much more difficult to win a major golf championship than an @entity69 , which were effectively two - horse races this season with both competitors from the same stable			0
@entity73 helped win the @entity74			0
@entity75 - @entity0 @entity0 should win by a mile ahead of @entity1			1
@entity0 does not enjoy a huge technological advantage over his opponents and in real sport everyone competes on level terms			2
@entity81 - @entity1 he should have won it in 2008 after clinching the @entity69 title in the most dramatic of circumstances but was beaten to the punch by sir @entity86 and i fancy @entity0 will get the better of him this year , too			1
a pity because @entity1 deserves it			2
a winner of 11 races this year under huge pressure , and is n’t it time @entity38 motor racing was recognised at @entity8 ? @entity94 was the last winner , a mighty 18 years ago			1
@entity0 holds aloft the @entity13 after claiming the @entity13 at @entity96 @entity1 is drenched in bubbly after posing for a photo with his @entity99 crew in the @entity11 pit - lane @entity101 - @entity0 let 's see ... the guy who has just compiled the finest season in the entire history of @entity38 golf or the bloke who came first in a two - car race			1
i think it might just be @entity0			2
@entity111 - @entity0 @entity0 – even went so far as to sacrifice his starry girlfriend so as to rescue his game			2
@entity114 - @entity0 because the golfer competes in a sport where all participants begin equal			2
@entity118 - @entity0 @entity119 seems a vibrant young man , the sort you would enjoy having a chat and drink with			2
in a contest judging sporting achievement and personality it is no contest			0
@entity0 sprays champagne as he celebrates @entity130 's victory in the @entity74 at @entity131 in @entity132 @entity1 was visibly emotional in the immediate aftermath of his victory @entity135 - @entity0 @entity0 for me			1
consistently brilliant and a refreshing personality			0
outside those two , perhaps a nod to @entity3 for his @entity140 heroics			0
@entity141 - @entity0 without doubt @entity0			2
while he beats opponents with the craft of his two hands , any @entity144 driver is only as good as his car			0
@entity1 is very good , of course , but so are the @entity99 mechanics			2
@entity0 has recovered his mojo and is accelerating at a rate that could challenge the all - time greats			2
just to recap : he won the @entity12 , the @entity13 and the @entity74 this year			1
in such a wide and talented field that is remarkable			0
he also has that personality bit			0
@entity157 - @entity0 @entity1 's achievement is fantastic but it has to be @entity0 for me			1
technology just plays too big a part in motor racing for it to be pure sport			0
@entity164 - @entity0 it 's @entity0 for me			0
it 's harder to win a golf major than a grand prix			0
and you 've got no one to help you			0
@entity172 : @entity173 12 - 2 @entity174 @entity1 , still with his helmet on , is given a kiss by his popstar girlfriend @entity177 after his victory			0

@entity1 and @entity0 are set for a @entity8 showdown
@entity1 claimed his second @entity182 in @entity11
@entity0 won the @entity12 and @entity13 earlier this year
