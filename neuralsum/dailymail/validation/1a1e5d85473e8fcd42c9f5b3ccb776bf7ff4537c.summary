despite the rather clunky acronym , @entity1 's @entity0 has been a runaway success on the quiet			1
though not cheap , at up to £ 40,000 , they 're selling like hot cakes — largely as a company car because of the massive tax advantages			0
now there 's good news for those whose budgets ca n't stretch to one , because there 's to be a smaller , mid-size sibling			2
the prototype xr - @entity0 ( @entity16 is a compact , lightweight suv powered by a new hybrid electric system			1
clearly aimed at top - selling @entity20 country , expect prices either side of £ 20,000 when the production model hits the market in a couple of years ' time			2
@entity1 's @entity27 ( @entity28 ( pictured ) will cost up to £ 40,000 ( prototype pictured ) @entity1 says of its baby phev : ' the system is estimated to achieve very low co2 emissions of below 40g/km while also delivering gutsy and smooth performance with its 163bhp electric motor			1
' it adds that it is developing plug - in electric hybrid systems best suited to each model in its line - up with a view to introducing them in the near future			1
the @entity0 can be charged overnight at home , run on electric - only power or operate in hybrid mode , switching automatically between petrol and electric power , depending on which is most efficient			1
it continues to charge itself as it runs on fossil fuel			2
the result is great fuel economy and low co2 emissions			1
but its real benefit — and one secret of its success — is on the tax front			0
it would be chancellor @entity58 's worst nightmare if everybody had one , as his tax take would plummet			2
here 's why : bought outright privately , the @entity0 costs £ 28,249 to £ 39,999 , which includes a taxpayer subsidy of £ 5,000			1
but company car drivers can look forward to an increase in their pay packet equal to an average of more than £ 4,000 every year , says @entity1			1
its twolitre petrol engine linked to two high - efficiency electric motors gives a combined range of 510 miles , of which 32.5 miles can be in pure electric mode			1
average co2 emissions are a tiny 44g/km and combined fuel efficiency is 148 mpg			1
but here 's the rub , get one as a company car and you pay just 5 per cent ' benefit in kind ' tax , compared to the 25 per cent that most business users pay			2
so , for example , a 40 per cent taxpayer with an @entity83 with a @entity85 taxable benefits value of £ 37,899 will pay just £ 758 in company car tax			0
that compares to £ 4,301 for a @entity89 2.2 i - @entity91 auto costing £ 33,605 , which is taxed at 32 per cent of its p11d value			0
that 's equivalent to a tax saving of £ 3,543 over a year or £ 10,730 over three			2
the new prototype 's big brother is the @entity98 ( pictured ) plus , its low co2 emissions mean you are exempt from road tax — and in @entity103 , the congestion charge , too			1
there 's a benefit for firms , too , notes @entity1 : ' a company purchasing an @entity0 is able to write down 100 per cent of the cost of the car against its profits chargeable for corporation tax in year one			1
' this is compared to a traditional company vehicle where a maximum of 18 per cent per annum of the cost is allowable to write down against the profits chargeable for corporation tax			0
' this means any business with even a small fleet could save tens of thousands of pounds in corporation tax in the first year			0
' less than a year on from its @entity122 launch last april , @entity1 has sold more than 10,000 outlander phevs			1
it 's overtaken every other plug - in hybrid and pure electric car , even passing vehicles that have been on sale since 2011 , such as the @entity128 , to become the @entity122 's favourite plug - in vehicle , says @entity1			1
its @entity122 managing director @entity130 adds : ' this is a satisfying achievement , but more significantly indicates this newly developing market is beginning to decide which electric vehicle technology delivers the right balance of low emissions , value , economy and practicality			2
' seat 's @entity141 concept car is pictured at the 85th @entity143 in @entity144 2015 seat has also jumped on to the growing sports utility bandwagon with a sporty off - roader shown at @entity144			2
the company , part of @entity151 giant @entity150 , is understood to be planning three crossover or @entity154 - style vehicles — with at least one gunning for @entity128 's @entity20 — dubbed the cash cow for the profits it 's earned for @entity128			0
seat 's chief executive @entity158 said : ' this is the first step in a family of suvs			0
the car is a lighthouse for our brand			0
' expect this look to carry through on models launched from 2016 to 2020			0
you do n't have to be a member to attend this year 's @entity171 at @entity172 next weekend , where drivers including @entity174 's @entity175 , @entity177 drummer @entity176 and singer - songwriter @entity178 of @entity180 fame will be racing			0
for the first time the @entity182 is opening the event to non-members			0
the biggest party ever held at @entity172 is also promised			0
the aim is to recreate the excitement of the @entity189 ( @entity189 ) held at @entity172 from 1949 to 1966			0
