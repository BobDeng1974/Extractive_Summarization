by @entity0 and @entity1 campaign : calls are growing for an independent inquiry into @entity5 , pictured in 1971 , as his victims demand ' proper justice ' the @entity8 faced growing demands last night for an independent inquiry into the @entity5 paedophilia scandal			1
mps , campaigners and lawyers for the victims dismissed @entity17 ’s ‘ legalistic ’ attempts to deny responsibility on the grounds that the horrifying abuse happened before he was party leader			2
they criticised mr @entity17 ’s cursory initial investigation into @entity5 ’s activities in 2012 – which the @entity8 leader said had not found evidence that the party knew of the predatory politician ’s four decades of molesting children			1
sir @entity28 , former chairman of the @entity29 , said the @entity8 had ‘ not got a good record in this area ’			2
and he said the party should set up an independent probe because they were ‘ relying on internal people who may have a vested interest in arriving at a particular conclusion ’			1
he also criticised mr @entity17 for making a ‘ legalistic ’ distinction between the @entity38 and the @entity8 who were formed in 1989 following a merger between the @entity41 and the @entity42			1
‘ people would see a political continuum from the @entity41 to the @entity8 , ’ sir @entity28 said			2
‘ in an organisational sense , many of the same people were there , so it is appropriate to properly investigate whether there had been any wrongdoing at that time			0
’ solicitor @entity53 of law firm @entity54 , who is representing six men abused by @entity5 as boys , echoed sir @entity28 ’s call for an independent probe			1
he said it was ‘ inconceivable ’ that senior liberals heard nothing about the allegations			0
mr @entity17 said on tuesday that @entity8 whips contacted every current mp and peer and trawled through all the party ’s records after @entity5 ’s vile sexual abuse was finally exposed by @entity70 mp @entity69 in @entity71 in 2012			1
no one admitted to hearing anything about the allegations – even though former @entity8 leader @entity75 was told in 1979 about complaints that @entity5 had abused boys			1
and a @entity8 spokesman later admitted the archives that were searched contained material dating almost exclusively from after the party ’s formation in 1989			1
under pressure : @entity17 , pictured during an interview on @entity85 , has been criticised for making ' legalistic ' excuses over the @entity5 scandal the records examined did not include documents from the old @entity38 to which @entity5 belonged when he was elected as mp for @entity91 in 1972			1
he served for 20 years until 1992 by which time he was a @entity8 , and died in 2010 aged 82			2
@entity92 , the former @entity93 reporter and anti-sleaze mp , said the @entity8 should follow the example of the @entity93 over @entity95 and hold a proper inquiry into how @entity5 ’s sex abuse was allowed to continue unchecked for so long			1
more than 7,500 people have signed a new online petition calling on @entity100 to launch a public inquiry into @entity5 ’s sexual abuse so that his victims can get ‘ proper justice ’			1
@entity75 , who nominated @entity5 for a knighthood in 1988 , refused to comment when approached by the @entity106 on tuesday			2
he has previously said that he received no complaints about @entity5 ’s activities as a @entity38 mp and that the obese politician denied any wrongdoing when he questioned him in 1979 about the allegations of ‘ unusual behaviour with boys ’			1
a @entity8 spokesman said last night : ‘ @entity5 ’s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined			1
his actions were not known to , or condoned by , the @entity38 or the @entity8			1
‘ these are extremely serious allegations and include suggestions that there was a cover - up by the police and security services			0
‘ allegations made in the @entity106 and elsewhere also include prominent members of the @entity70 and @entity130 parties			0
‘ such serious allegations , involving a range of institutions , must be a matter for the police			0
’ open secret : campaigners argue that rumours of @entity5 's abuse of young boys were widely known both in @entity140 and his constituency fresh evidence that rumours of @entity5 ’s sickening activities were widely known emerged yesterday , raising damaging new questions for @entity17 and the @entity8			1
it was alleged that claims that @entity5 abused boys were raised on the floor of a @entity38 conference , but that nothing was done about it			2
separately , a former campaigner for the @entity42 described how senior party officials panicked during the 1983 election because of fears @entity5 would be exposed as a child abuser			2
the @entity42 was in an electoral alliance with the @entity38 , which @entity5 represented as mp for @entity91 , and would later merge with it to form the @entity8			1
@entity161 , an @entity42 activist in @entity162 , said a warning came down from party headquarters in @entity165			0
‘ there was kind of an alert , an alarm that one of the other parties had got hold of the fact that @entity5 had interfered with boys yet again , ’ he told @entity167 ’s today programme			0
' turning a blind eye ' : it is alleged that claims about @entity5 , pictured relaxing in a deckchair at @entity182 ahead of a party conference , abusing boys was raised on the floor of a @entity38 conference but no action was taken meanwhile , new details were also revealed yesterday of @entity5 ’s fears that he would be ruined when a local @entity91 newspaper published an article in 1979 disclosing that the police had investigated complaints that he abused boys at a hostel in the town			2
@entity196 , who was 15 and working for @entity5 ’s election campaign team at the time , recalled that @entity5 was terrified of the effect the story would have on his political career if it was followed up by national newspapers			0
‘ he said something along the lines of “ this will destroy me ”			0
he was white as a sheet , ’ he said			0
but about two days later @entity5 ’s brother @entity208 walked into the campaign office and said they had ‘ seen to it that the story would go nowhere ’			0
mr @entity196 added : ‘ after that day , @entity5 was back to his old self			0
’ @entity70 mp for @entity91 @entity69 told the @entity93 yesterday he believed the rumours of @entity5 ’s activities were raised at a @entity38 conference			2
he said : ‘ i spoke to a @entity8 student activist from the mid- 70s who said these allegations actually got raised on the floor of conference for the @entity41			0
lots of people are aware of it			0
’ mr @entity69 , author of an explosive new book about the cover - up of @entity5 ’s abuse serialised by the @entity106 , said the rumours were well known in @entity91			0
he also alleged that @entity5 was protected in @entity140 because he was part of a ‘ paedophile network ’ there after becoming an mp in 1972			0
he said he believed it included other senior figures – and that to have exposed it could have toppled the government .			0

the @entity38 merged with the @entity42 in 1989
@entity5 was then a member of the @entity8 until 1992 when he retired
but @entity17 's initial investigation only looked at archives from 1989
more than 7,500 have signed a petition calling for an independent probe
