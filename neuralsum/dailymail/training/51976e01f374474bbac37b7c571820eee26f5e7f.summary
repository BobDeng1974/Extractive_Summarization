@entity0 has surprised audiences with the announcement of the @entity3 - a phone with a screen that curves around the phone on one side			1
the technology is something that has appeared in several fan concepts for the upcoming @entity10 , but it appears @entity0 have got there first			0
the screen was described by @entity0 's @entity13 as working like a ' ticker ' , with notifications and news scrolling along it			2
the @entity24 ( shown ) has a curved right hand side that can display notifications like a ' ticker ' the @entity24 's unique curved touchscreen that provides quick access to frequently used apps , alerts and device functionality			1
processor : 2.7 @entity34 display : 5.6 inches ( 141.9mm ) @entity36 ( 2560 x 1440 ) operating system : @entity38 4.4 ( @entity39 ) rear camera : 16 megapixel auto focus camera with @entity42 front camera : 3.7 @entity44 memory : 32/64 gb internal and @entity46 ( up to 64 gb ) @entity47 : @entity48 dimensions : 151.3 x 82.4 x 8.3 mm weight : 174 grams as it pops out of the phone it can even be used when the cover is closed			1
the curved screen can also display notifications at the top and bottom while viewing a video without disruption			1
the right hand side of the edge , which is curved , is where notifications and other icons appear			1
the @entity3 was announced at the @entity65 trade show in @entity66 on wednesday , alongside the new @entity24 note 4 phone , which lacks the side screen , and a virtual - reality headset called @entity70			1
they are due for release in october - in time for holiday shopping - and aim to compete with @entity20 's new @entity74 due to be unveiled next week			2
the edge uses @entity0 's flexible - display technology , which came out with much fanfare last year but has seen little use beyond a phone and a fitness device with displays that were slightly curved			1
with the edge , @entity0 is offering a practical use for the curvature			0
while the main screen remains flat like previous phones , the right edge extends and curves until it reaches the back			0
that creates a side display so information such as weather and time can be seen from the side when the phone is laid on a table or nightstand			2
with the side display , the phone 's camera functions more like a stand - alone , point - and - shoot camera , as the shutter button and other functions appear on top when the phone is held horizontally			1
the @entity109 sports a @entity107 rear - facing camera ( right ) and a @entity111 front camera ( left )			1
it comes on a big day for announcements that included the @entity114 and the @entity115 developed in tandem with @entity118 - owned virtual reality company @entity117 @entity120 television presenter @entity119 showed off a virtual - reality headset called @entity70 during the @entity0 event ahead of the consumer electronic fair @entity65 in @entity66			1
the headset has sensors to gauge the head 's position and tells an attached @entity129 phone which part of a 360 - degree image to display the side display of the edge also provides one - tap access to various apps normally found on the home screen			1
the announcement of a phone with a curved side comes less than a week before @entity20 is expected to announce at least one similar curved device			2
the unique look is seen at eventually being a key selling point for mobile and tablets , but it does n't feature heavily in many devices yet			0
' an edge - based display will give @entity0 's smartphone clear differentiation in a crowded market , ' said @entity151 , an analyst covering the mobile industry at @entity153 in @entity154			1
' but for @entity0 to maximise the potential of an edge display it needs third party apps to support the display with additional @entity0 - specific functions			2
' it will also have a panel of tools , like the flashlight and stopwatch , akin to what @entity20 offers in the @entity166 with a swipe up from the bottom			0
@entity0 will look to app developers to find new ways to use the feature			0
@entity0 did n't announce prices , though			0
in the @entity174 , last year 's @entity173 went for about £ 425 ( $ 700 ) without a contract , or £ 180 ( $ 300 ) with one			0
prices are likely to be similar when the @entity114 comes out in october			2
@entity177 , however , will likely cost more			0
analysts said the new display feature could cut both ways			0
' an edge - based display will give @entity0 's smartphone clear differentiation in a crowded market , ' said @entity151 , an analyst covering the mobile industry at @entity153 in @entity154			1
' but for @entity0 to maximise the potential of an edge display it needs third party apps to support the display with additional @entity0 - specific functions			2
' a visitor holds a new @entity195 smartphone after its presentation at the unpacked 2014 episode 2 event today ahead of the @entity198 show in @entity66 another new announcement recently from @entity0 was the @entity70 s smart watch , seen here at a media launch event today in @entity202			2
the @entity203 is the fourth smart watch @entity0 has released in a year it was a day of several big announcements for @entity0 at @entity65 in @entity66 , as the much - rumoured @entity206 was also unveiled			1
the latest version of the large smartphone has an improved interface , including a new @entity211 feature that enables users to minimise and resize different screens on their phone for multi-tasking in much the same way you would on a desktop computer			0
the device will go on sale next month			0
initial reaction within the industry suggests @entity0 has responded well to profit drops earlier in the year , with operating profit dropping by 25 per cent in the company 's second quarter results			0
@entity227 , mobiles expert at @entity228 , said : ' when it comes to @entity0 , bigger is usually better , and its fourth generation phablet is no exception			0
' size-wise , the @entity114 is no bigger than the @entity173 , but it 's still bigger than most pockets			0
' the @entity233 , shown , features a rounded 5.6 - inch screen			0
' an edge - based display will give @entity0 's smartphone clear differentiation in a crowded market , ' said analyst @entity151			1

@entity19 - based @entity0 has surprisingly revealed a curved ' phablet '
beats @entity20 to the punch , who are apparently also planning curved devices
the @entity24 has a curved right hand side that can display notifications like a ' ticker '
it also sports a @entity107 rear - facing camera and a @entity111 front camera
it comes on a big day for announcements that included the @entity114 and a virtual reality headset developed in tandem with @entity117 called @entity70
@entity0 has not yet announced how much the @entity24 will cost
its release date is not known either although the @entity114 and @entity70 will be out in october this year
