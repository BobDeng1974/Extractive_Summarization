by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:54 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 19:07 est , 29 september 2013 several @entity4 mps are planning to run on ‘ joint tickets ’ with the @entity7 @entity6 at the next general election , it emerged last night			1
a handful of mps were said to be considering a ‘ @entity12 ’ campaign to prevent @entity13 capitalising on a split vote following a surge in support for @entity18 ’s party			1
the sitting @entity4 mp would stand as a @entity4 - @entity6 candidate			1
in return for its support , @entity6 would expect to be able to influence @entity4 policy			1
banned : @entity6 leader @entity18 to due to appear at three events at the @entity4 party conference , but has been erased from the official guide @entity19 mp was the first to float the idea earlier this year , saying she would be ‘ having that kind of conversation ’ with activists in her constituency and that many conservatives have ‘ huge empathy ’ with @entity6			1
eight @entity4 - held seats are said to be at high risk of being lost because of @entity6 splitting the traditional @entity4 vote and letting in either @entity13 or the @entity37			1
the proposal comes as the latest @entity40 poll shows that @entity13 has surged ahead , mainly at the expense of the conservatives who are losing voters to @entity6			1
the poll puts @entity13 on 42 per cent , the @entity44 on 31 per cent , @entity6 on 13 per cent and the @entity37 on 9 per cent			1
rejection : foreign secretary @entity45 ruled out the idea of a pact with @entity6 to prevent the loss of @entity4 votes @entity50 pledged yesterday to remove all commitments to ‘ ever - closer union ’ from @entity54 treaties			1
in a hardening of his stance , the prime minister said he wanted to go as far as erasing the @entity54 ’s original mission statement , which commits nations to closer integration			2
he said : ‘ others can sign up to an ever - closer union , but @entity7 should not			2
i ’m determined to make sure we get out of that			2
’ speaking at the @entity4 conference , foreign secretary @entity45 also told delegates that more countries were coming round to @entity7 ’s view that powers should be returned to individual countries			1
miss @entity19 said yesterday : ‘ i know other mps in marginal constituencies are in talks about entering into agreements			2
it ’s going to be very difficult in the general election when you ’ve got two candidates espousing the same sort of values			2
‘ we ’ll have a conservative candidate calling for a referendum , being strong on crime , immigration and grammar schools , and the @entity6 candidate saying much the same sort of things			1
so there ’s a case for running on a joint ticket			2
’ @entity93 yesterday stamped on the claims , saying joint tickets would not be allowed and any mp who tried would not have their nomination papers signed			0
but it comes as a hard - hitting report out yesterday by @entity99 , a right - wing think tank , warned that @entity4 membership is ‘ dying ’ and could be overtaken by @entity6 in just five years ’ time			1
among its recommendations to reverse the trend are a pact with @entity6 , initiatives to attract younger members online , and for candidates to be selected without interference from the party ’s central command			1
yesterday , a cabinet minister said that core @entity4 voters ‘ must be made aware that if they vote @entity6 they could get @entity114 ’			1
and @entity116 , @entity4 mp for @entity117 , a marginal seat which could be lost to @entity6 , said : ‘ the right thing for an honest politician to do is stand on a manifesto he or she truly believes in			1
the wrong thing to do is run scared and sign up to a set of someone else ’s beliefs just for personal , short - term electoral gain			2
’ banned : @entity50 has revealed women could be prohibited from wearing @entity131 veils in courts the @entity131 veil could be banned in courts , schools and immigration centres , @entity50 signalled yesterday			1
the prime minister said he was ‘ happy ’ to look at whether the government should issue national guidelines to limit the use of full - face veils			0
he insisted there was no question of legislation to prevent @entity131 women wearing the niqab veil completely , but voiced strong support for the right of judges , juries , teachers and immigration officers who demand that they are removed			0
mr @entity50 also suggested patients being treated in hospitals should have a right to see the face of any doctor or nurse treating them			1
the prime minister told the @entity162 ’s @entity161 : ‘ we are a free country and people should be free to wear whatever clothes they like in public or in private			0
but we should support those institutions that need to put in place rules so that those institutions can work properly			0
‘ so for instance in a school , if they want that particular dress code , i believe the government should back them			0
the same for courts , the same for immigration			0
‘ we should back those institutions that want to have sensible policies that actually have a particular purpose			0
’ earlier this month a judge in @entity181 ordered a @entity131 defendant to remove her veil to give evidence			0
judge @entity185 said it was crucial for the jury to see the woman ’s face so they could assess her demeanour and expression			0
but , in a case that made legal history , he said she could retain the veil for all other parts of her trial			0
and he asked politicians for clearer instructions on veils in court			0
asked if he would support calls for national guidelines on the wearing of the niqab in court , mr @entity50 said : ‘ i ’m very happy to look at that			2
‘ obviously , in court the jury needs to be able to look at someone ’s face			0
i ’ve sat on a jury , that ’s part of what you do			0
‘ when someone is coming into the country , an immigration officer needs to see someone ’s face			0
‘ in a school , it ’s very difficult to teach unless you can look your pupils in the eye			0
’ the issue of veils in schools erupted earlier this month when students , staff and visitors to @entity230 were told they must have their faces visible at all times so they are ‘ easily identifiable ’			0
following an outcry , the college reversed the decision .			0
