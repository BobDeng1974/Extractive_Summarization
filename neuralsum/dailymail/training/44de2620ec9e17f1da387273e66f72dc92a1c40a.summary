sealed with a kiss : @entity0 celebrates winning the @entity5 after his straight sets win over @entity11 @entity0 said : ' he brought just , in the team , a very relaxed atmosphere , besides extremely huge knowledge			1
' at the beginning when we started to work , we sat together and @entity2 told me that my game and my tennis has to be aggressive tennis			2
' i ca n't play too much tactically , because most of the times before i was dealing too much with the tactics against players and not focusing on my game			0
' it was n't easy to change my perspective and to change completely my mindset			0
it took even five , six months of the tournaments to be able to sink that into me and that i know on the court that 's the right way for me to play			0
celebration time : @entity2 celebrates as @entity0 wins the @entity5 ' definitely my serve has improved enormously , and then everything else has followed			1
' @entity0 , 25 , will now move up to no 9 in the world rankings after claiming a title which seemed unthinkable prior to the tournament , even for the man himself			1

i was dreaming about this all my life , and suddenly the last four , five days everything started to change , and with my tennis especially			0
overcome with emotion : @entity0 falls to the floor after winning the @entity5 final in straight sets ' it means everything			1

this is just the peak of the world			2
' despite a disappointing end to the tournament , @entity11 's run to the final was impressive considering that he missed both the @entity68 and @entity69 last month after having a cyst removed from his right foot			2
he 's done it : @entity0 punches the air after winning his first grand slam title at @entity76 the @entity77 24 - year - old - who will move to a career - high no 8 in the rankings - will take the positives from his fortnight at @entity76 , which included two stunning consecutive victories against @entity84 and world no 1 @entity86			1
@entity11 said : ' it was one of the worst matches i played today , but also he was very aggressive and very fast			2
i was , i have to say , a little bit nervous			0
' i did n't expect anything coming here			0
before i was injured and [ had ] little practice			0
following in the footsteps : @entity0 became the first @entity6 since @entity2 to win a grand slam ' there is so many positive things for sure that i can have from these two weeks beating @entity84 and @entity86 again			1
' i think i showed i can beat anybody now			2
so if i can keep training hard and also practice hard , i think i have more chances coming up			0

@entity0 beat @entity11 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 in the @entity5 final
