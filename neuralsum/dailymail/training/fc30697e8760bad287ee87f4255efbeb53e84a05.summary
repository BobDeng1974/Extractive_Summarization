this @entity1 home may look like a normal house from the outside - but hidden behind its walls is an organ more complex than many found inside churches around the world			1
and while the one - bedroom property is on the market for $ 129,000 , the rare instrument would take music - lovers five years to assemble to the tune of $ 1 million dollars , experts say			1
the 85 - year - old organ was bought in 2002 from a @entity17 church by homeowner @entity18 , who died this year at 72			1
he was long obsessed with organs - even though he never knew how to play			0
the instrument , which has three sets of keyboards and pedals , is next to the kitchen table and when it is played , a giant blower can be heard in the basement , @entity21 reported			0
music to your ears : this modest @entity33 , @entity1 house is home to an organ with around 2,300 pipes complex : the home is on the market for $ 129,000 - even though the organ costs around $ 1 million hidden : a room at the back of the house is filled with pipes , with the tallest standing at 17 feet but while the keys are the only part of the instrument on show , the organ 's extensive web of pipes take up a third of the entire house			1
pipes of all sizes are hidden in a room at the back of the house			2
the longest pipe is 17 feet and , in total , there are around 2,300 pipes - each providing a different music note			1
@entity18 , who adored organ music but worked as a car mechanic , had wanted a pipe in his home ever since he was a boy - but he could only ever look at it			1
' he could n't play it , but he wanted an organ in his house so he had it put in , ' realtor @entity70 told @entity21			2
web : a giant blower is in the basement , while pipes fill up so many other rooms that there is just one bedroom and one - and - a - half bathrooms inside the house			2
the organ took the previous owner years to build work of art : each of the pipes provides a different note - and the house is well insulated to prevent noise extravagant : it would cost $ 100,000 to re-install the pipes elsewhere - and $ 1 million to completely replicate grand : the organ 's previous owner , who passed away this year aged 72 , could not even play the instrument he found the organ , which dates from the 1990s , in need of serious repair in @entity17 and installed it with the help of friends and @entity103 , the @entity104 reported			1
@entity18 , who had no surviving family members , bequeathed the home to @entity107 , the owner of @entity109 , and his partner , @entity110			2
because of the @entity113 organ , the house has just one upstairs bedroom and one - and - a - half baths , but the garage where @entity18 worked as a handyman is heated and air - conditioned			0
@entity107 said re-installation would cost about $ 100,000 , and he estimated that duplicating the entire ' irreplaceable treasure ' would likely cost close to $ 1 million			0
despite its size , insulation inside the house means the neighbors wo n't complain about the noise			0
unassuming : from the outside it is impossible to tell that the rare instrument fills up rooms inside much - needed space : as well as the house , the property has a garage that is heated and air - conditioned it 's ' probably not any more [ noise ] than your average church would leak sound , ' @entity70 said			1
he said he 's received calls from across the country , and some potential buyers want to salvage the organ and re-sell the home			0
@entity107 said they hope to find a buyer who possesses the same passion and dedication to the merger of the home and instrument as his late friend			0
' we really would like somebody to buy it who likes the organ and appreciates it for what it is , ' he said .			0

the owner of the home , which is in @entity33 , @entity1 , passed away this year , aged 72
even though he could not play the organ , he worked for years to install the instrument inside his home after buying it from a church in 2002
it has 2,300 pipes , *including* ones that reach 17ft , hidden behind the walls
