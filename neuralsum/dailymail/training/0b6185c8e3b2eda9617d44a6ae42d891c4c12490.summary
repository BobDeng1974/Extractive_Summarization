most of us boast @entity3 friends that number in the hundreds but a new study has found that online friendships bear little resemblance to the real deal			1
being counted as a real friend means meeting up at least twice a month and indulging in eight phone chats over the same period			1
what 's more , friendships must last for at least three years before best friend status can be conferred			1
@entity14 actually have a very strict criteria for whom they consider to be considered a close friend the findings are the result of a new study which looked at the impact of social media on offline friendships			2
far from boosting friendship , the study found that the majority of @entity14 only speak to one in nine of their @entity3 friends on a regular basis			1
the 2,000 adults asked also said that in order to qualify as a real friend , shared experiences such as holidays and weddings are essential , as are shared life events such as pregnancies			1
friends should also know plenty about each other , including who their first lover was and what their favourite food is			2
real friendship requires speaking on the phone or texting up to eight times per month men had lower expectations in terms of how often they speak to and see close friends , with the majority claiming to see their best friends less than once a month			1
people aged between 24 and 35 have the most close friends , with 10 apiece , while those aged between 56 and 65 had the fewest			2
those living in @entity54 are the most popular in @entity14 , with one in five boasting more than 10 close friends			0
meanwhile , @entity56 are the least popular , where a paradoxically lonely one in five claim to have no one they consider to be close friends			0
buying thoughtful presents at key times like @entity63 and birthdays , along with gifts to commemorate weddings , new babies , new homes and wedding anniversaries , was also considered important , with an average spend of Â£ 25 per occasion			0
more 25 - 34 year olds reported having more than 10 close friends than any other age group ' these days , most people spend a lot of time keeping in touch via social media , ' said a spokesman for @entity79 , which commissioned the research			0
' but our study shows that this alone does not make for meaningful friendships , and most of us still believe that the traditional values of friendship			0
' spending quality time together , being there for key life experiences and doing thoughtful things such as giving presents on special occasions are the things that really matter to most			0

real friendship requires eight calls and two meetings a month
*relationships* must last for three years before best friend status is given
by contrast , most speak to just one in nine of their @entity3 friends
