by @entity0 a @entity2 paramedic is lucky to be alive after experiencing first hand how life can change in an instance just two weeks ago			1
@entity6 and his ambulance partner were dispatched to a woman 's home after a mental health assessment said she needed to be taken to hospital			1
but the 27 - year - old had no idea he was about to face off with a near death encounter when he knocked on that very door			0
' then she suddenly pulled out a knife - it must of been up her sleeve - and she charged at me with it and just swung it at me , aiming for my throat			1
' it was mr @entity6 's quick reflexes that saved him from becoming a casualty			2
' i arced my head back and the knife was about 10cm away from my throat , ' he said			1
' then i remember calling out " knife , knife " as i fell back into my colleague and the police who were behind me			2
' from that moment , a 90 minute siege ensued as officers - including mr @entity6 and his partner - backed into a corridor behind a glass door			1
' the police had their pistols drawn and were trying to hold the door shut because it did n't have a lock on it , ' mr @entity6 said			2
' the woman was still shouting at us , threatening to kill us , then she walked over with a pot of boiling water and told us she was going to pour it through the cracks of the glass panel			2
' mr @entity6 said about 30 police arrived at the scene and were eventually able to verbally de-escalate the situation			1
the 27 - year - old says this is n't an isolated incident as paramedics are increasingly experiencing violence and aggression however , the incident has left mr @entity6 traumatised			1
' at the time i was in work mode but after it ended , i remember saying â€œ what the hell was that ? i nearly lost my life " , ' he said			0
' after going back to the branch and debriefing , when i was finally alone i felt a huge amount of grief , ' he said			0
' there are times i feel waves of emotion like a tsunami force where i get smacked down and would just break down in tears			0
' my sleeping patterns are getting better and the nightmares are decreasing but i 'm still not sleeping well			0
' but mr @entity6 says his recent confrontation is n't an isolated case			2
' it 's not just me and mine is n't a unique situation , ' he said			0
' hundreds of paramedics go through similar incidents			0
this happens to ambos across the board			0
' mr @entity6 says paramedics are increasingly experiencing violence and aggression when they 're called out to jobs			1
he believes the high prevalence of mental illness and the growing amount of drug use in society is a huge contributor			0
' it 's just ridiculous the amount of violence we encounter , ' mr @entity6 said			1
' but no one is talking about it so that 's why i 've decided to speak out so i can raise awareness about the kind of risks we as paramedics face on a daily basis			0

@entity6 was dispatched to a woman 's home two weeks ago
upon his arrival , she was verbally *abusive* and pulled out a knife from her sleeve , *swinging* just 10cm away from his throat
police , who were already on the scene , called for back up and a 90 minute siege ensued
the @entity2 paramedic said there has been an increase in aggression and violence
