@entity1 coach @entity0 has named an unchanged side for sunday 's @entity4 match against @entity5 but has not yet ruled out injured captain @entity6			1
the @entity8 loose forward was forced to sit out @entity1 's opening 32 - 26 win over @entity11 in @entity12 on saturday after failing to recover from a quad muscle injury sustained in his club 's @entity15 defeat by @entity18 earlier this month			1
@entity0 says @entity6 is continuing to make progress in his recovery and could yet be drafted in for the match at @entity23 's @entity22			1
@entity1 keep the same line - up team that beat @entity11 last weekend , but can still make changes captain @entity6 is ' definitely improving ' according to @entity27 , and could make a return @entity1 train at their @entity31 base on tuesday , and could still change things before playing @entity5 @entity1 , who are also thought to be monitoring scrum - half @entity34 and hooker @entity36 after they picked up knocks against the @entity11 , have followed protocol by naming their team early in the week but have the right to change it			1
' we have named the same 17 as last week , ' said @entity0			0
' a few of our blokes have n't been able to train fully during the early part of the week			0
' even though we have named the same side , there could be a change or two at the back end of the week			2
' those that were unable to train are making decent progress			0
@entity6 is definitely improving and we will continue to monitor him throughout this week			2
@entity1 beat @entity11 32 - 26 in @entity12 on the weekend but @entity0 admits ' there is room for improvement ' @entity54 fends off @entity1 's @entity34 during a hard - fought win for @entity0 's side in their first game ' it is really difficult to name a team earlier in the week			1
a firmer decision will be made towards the weekend , when we arrive in @entity62			0
' @entity1 have stayed at their base on @entity64 's @entity31 following their opening match and will travel to @entity62 on thursday to complete their preparations for a victory bid which , if successful , would take them through to a first @entity70 or @entity4 final in the southern hemisphere			1
@entity1 's last victory against @entity5 was the 1995 @entity74 opener at @entity75 , when the hosts won 20 - 16 , although @entity78 's @entity77 beat the @entity79 23 - 12 in the @entity80 in 2006 in @entity81			1
the last time @entity1 beat @entity5 was in 1995 , when they won their opening game of the @entity74 @entity11 made @entity1 work hard for their win on saturday , and are just one win away from making the final @entity6 is the only member of the 24 - man squad to have ever tasted success against @entity5 , having played in both the 2004 and 2006 @entity80 tournaments			1
if he fails to make the line - up , @entity89 will lead the side , as he did against the @entity92 , who twice held the lead and pushed @entity1 all the way at @entity96			2
' it was a hard - fought win for us against @entity11 , ' @entity0 said			0
' there is room for improvement within our game			0
we had to overcome a very talented and tenacious team with limited preparation in extreme heat			0
@entity11 twice took the lead , but @entity1 came back to win against ' a very talented and tenacious team ' ' i was pleased with the way we dug in and found a way to win in extreme circumstances			2
we will have to show that same resolve this week			0
' the organisers have decided not to go with neutral referees , appointing @entity117 @entity116 for sunday 's game while new zealander @entity119 will be in charge of the @entity122 ' clash with @entity11 in @entity123 on sunday .			0

captain @entity6 not in side but could be drafted in late on
@entity6 still *unavailable* following quad muscle injury
@entity1 looking for first victory over @entity5 since 1995
win would see @entity1 reach final in southern hemisphere for first time
