pregnant : equalities minister @entity0 is due to give birth on @entity2 the heavily pregnant minister who stood throughout prime minister 's questions has insisted she does not think it would have been ' sexist ' if an mp had offered her a seat			1
a major row erupted in @entity9 after aides to @entity12 equalities minister @entity0 suggested she thought it was ‘ quite sexist ’ to claim she was not capable of standing			1
but in an attempt to diffuse the row , which saw @entity16 insist offering a seat was the ' decent thing to do , miss @entity0 has insisted that all seat offers are ' welcome ' and ' definitely not sexist '			1
the incident reignited the debate about whether people should offer their seat to pregnant women , and whether expectant mothers should assume they would			2
mr @entity16 made clear that giving up a seat for a pregnant woman was the ' decent thing ' to do			1
miss @entity0 champions women ’s rights in government and has called for a change in attitudes to new parents			0
but onlookers were alarmed to see the 33 - year - old standing during throughout @entity35 yesterday , while @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity12 backbenchers sat nearby			1
as @entity16 took questions in the commons at midday every seat was taken , leaving a large group of mps standing by the main doors			1
miss @entity0 , who is due to give birth on christmas day , was among them			2
but none of the mps sitting just feet away offered her a seat – to the surprise of @entity9 observers			0
@entity51 , political editor of @entity52 , wrote on @entity53 : ‘ quite remarkable that no mp has offered @entity0 , who is seven months pregnant , a seat			2
' really shocking lack of manners and decency			0
’ conservative mp @entity58 , who was in another part of the chamber , said : ‘ i saw her standing and i thought someone should have made the gesture of offering her a seat			1
she is very heavily pregnant and it ’s just the decent thing to do			0
‘ if i see someone on the tube or the bus who ’s pregnant , i will absolutely always get up for them			0
’ yesterday aides to @entity73 claimed the idea that she was not capable of standing was ' sexist '			1
a source close to the minister said : ‘ the suggestion somehow that people should be outraged on her behalf is ridiculous			1
the idea that just because she is seven months pregnant she has lost all ability to stand on her two feet or fend for herself is quite sexist			2
' she did not think it was an issue			0
if she had wanted to sit down she would have asked to sit			0
she is quite capable of fulfilling her functions as a minister – including standing and walking – while she is pregnant			1
she is not somehow severely incapacitated			0
’ but miss @entity0 last night tried to play down the claims			0
she wrote on @entity53 : ' about to get on the tube - seat offers welcome & definitely not sexist : o ) but i was happier standing at pmqs yesterday			1
' and today she praised a ' lovely man who put my case in the overhead locker on last night 's flight home '			0
standing room only : none of the mps who had secured a seat for prime minister 's questions gave up their place for @entity73 ( circled ) the issue of whether to offer up a seat to a pregnant woman has become increasingly vexed			1
in one camp are those that argue expectant mothers are more likely to be tired - they are carrying around another person after all - and will appreciate the option of sitting down			0
but critics say the idea that a pregnant woman can not stand up on a train or a bus is sexist and patronising			2
last year mother - to - be @entity121 hit out at ' barbaric ' passengers on a packed @entity124 tram who refused to give up their tram seat - even though she is eight months ' pregnant and needs crutches to walk			1
when @entity127 , five months pregnant , was presented with a ' @entity128 ' in march last year she joked she would ' wear it at home '			0
yesterday the source close to @entity73 said the minister did not want to ‘ give a running commentary ’ on whether she had been offered or accepted seats in other circumstances , such as on public transport			1
‘ sometimes she ’s in the middle of a carriage surrounded by people who are also standing so other passengers may not see her , ’ the source added			1
‘ she does not necessarily feel aggrieved about that			0
’ miss @entity0 is a junior business minister working with @entity143 , and has pushed for greater equality for women at work			2
she has admitted the pressure of carrying a baby was taking its toll on being a minister in the government and @entity12 mp for @entity153			0
however mr @entity16 's official spokesman insisted the prime minister thought anyone should give up their seat for a pregnant woman			1
' take the example of public transport - i think if you see someone who is in greater need of a seat than yourself i think offering that seat is a good thing to do ... a decent thing to do , ' the spokesman said			2
asked if mr @entity16 would offer his seat to a pregnant woman if he was on a bus , the spokesman said : ' i 'm sure he would			1
' pressed on whether that would be a sexist thing to do , the spokesman said : ' offering one 's seat to someone who is in greater need than oneself on public transport ? i think that 's a very understandable thing to do			2
' once tipped as a future @entity185 secretary , she admitted she will not be able to lead the charge in next year ’s independent referendum			0
‘ clearly , there will be a period when i wo n’t be able to be quite as active on the doorsteps , ’ she told the @entity188 on sunday last month			2
‘ but , yes , i want to be strongly involved in that campaign because i believe it ’s so important for the future of @entity185 and , indeed , for the future of the @entity196			0
’ she is also adamant that she will not take ministerial red boxes while on maternity leave			0
‘ i am still very committed and enjoy my job and want to come back to continue doing that , but i think having a bit of time to do that early bonding is also really important			0
