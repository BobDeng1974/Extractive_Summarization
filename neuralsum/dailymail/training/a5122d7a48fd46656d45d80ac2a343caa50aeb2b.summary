@entity1 was planning on ending up in @entity18 via @entity15 transfer
the former @entity3 *frontman* 's plane from @entity16 was diverted to the north west but @entity1 was forced to stay on the plane

@entity1 had to fly to @entity15 before travelling back to @entity18 to meet with family
the @entity110 striker , who now owns *racehorses* , had been to the @entity12 meeting
striker is in hot water with @entity84 sport after *choosing* to watch his horse race rather than cover @entity3 's clash with @entity27
