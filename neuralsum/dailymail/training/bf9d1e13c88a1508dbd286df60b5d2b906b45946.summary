by @entity0 published : 03:12 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 03:17 est , 7 august 2013 a computer designed to tell witty one - liners has been criticised for being sexist and un-pc			1
scientists at the @entity4 created the software to tell one - line jokes using a simple set of rules in which a statement is followed up with an amusing punchline , such as ' i like my coffee like i like my war ... cold '			1
however , some of the lines the computer has produced have been criticised for being sexist or in bad taste including ' i like my men like i like my acorns ... buried ' and ' i like my women like i like my gas ... natural			1
' a computer designed by the @entity4 to tell witty one - liners has been criticised for being sexist			1
the software creates jokes using a simple set of rules but has ended up comparing men and women to different objects such as ' i like my women like i like my gas ... natural ' i like my women like i like my gas ... natural			1
i like my men like i like my acorns ... buried			0
i like my boys like i like my sectors ... bad			0
i like my men like i like my monoxide ... @entity36			0
i like my men like i like my court ... superior			0
i like my coffee like i like my war ... @entity41			0
i like my relationships like i like my source ... open			0
i like my fish like i like my text ... @entity47			0
i like my business like i like my fish ... small			0
the software was based on the comedy of stars such as @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 - all renowned for their one - line humour			1
yet the software has ended up with a politically incorrect approach to the comedy by producing jokes that some people consider to be sexist			1
while other jokes are more surreal than funny			2
the computer software works by finding ' unlikely pairings of words and to make a connection between them			1
' according to reports in @entity71 , the computer most commonly creates jokes that compare men or women to objects			1
such jokes include : ' i like my women like i like my gas ... natural ' , ' i like my men like i like my court ... superior ' and ' i like my men like i like my acorns ... buried			2
' jokes that erred more on the side of surrealism included ' i like my men like i like my court ... superior ' and ' i like my fish like i like my text ... raw			2
' @entity89 , a computer scientist who helped develop the software , told @entity71 that volunteers laughed when they were told the computerised jokes			2
however , they laughed more at man - made humour			0
@entity89 added that the software would need to ' develop cultural awareness ' if the jokes were to improve			2
he told @entity71 : ' computers have an advantage over people in that they can process masses of information , so we fed computers a wealth of material from which they extracted creative and unusual word combinations to fit our joke template			0
dr @entity89 is presenting the software at the @entity110 conference in @entity111			0
comedians including @entity52 , pictured , @entity54 and @entity55 are renowned for their brand of one - liner comedy			1
the software was created to try and mimic this type of humour but needs more ' cultural awareness ' to become as funny as human comedians			2

software creates comedy by finding a connection between pairs of words
it then produces one - liner jokes based on the comedians *nicluding* @entity52
however some of its jokes have been criticised for being sexist
