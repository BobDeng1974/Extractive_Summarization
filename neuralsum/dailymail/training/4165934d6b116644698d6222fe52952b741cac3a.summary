by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the party line from @entity3 as destiny awaits the world champions in the @entity6 is that tiki – taka football is alive and well and the era goes on			1
the private whisper is that they may be bracing themselves to turn and run with the wind of change which is blowing up an electrifying storm of goals in this @entity17			1
d - day against the red - hot @entity20 peppers who gave @entity22 a recent roasting at @entity24 stands not only for destiny but also decision			2
stick or twist ? @entity43 - who describes his team ’s 5 - 1 collapse against @entity46 at the opening of their title defence as ‘ unexplainable ’ – confronts a choice which he has no need to tell us is unenviable			1
@entity43 , who accepts his job will be on the line if they fail to qualify from the group , says : ‘ tactically it will be a different game from @entity46 because @entity20 are brave and quick and risk attacking all the time			2
’ @entity58 , a possible replacement for @entity60 , says : ‘ i hope we can win playing our style at a high level but if not we have to win any way we can			1
’ it is an enormous risk for any team to change tack in the midst of a major tournament			2
for the winners not only of the last @entity17 but also two successive @entity71 , a change so drastic will be condemned as heresy if it fails			1
video we 're still hurting choices : @entity43 must be considering changing the way his team play so far as the eve of a match which could be pivotal for the development of the world game as well the outcome of @entity83 2014 , the word is only that @entity3 are in profound deliberation			1
we are unlikely to get the verdict until an hour before the kick - off here , when @entity43 hands in his team sheet			1
for ‘ uexplainable ’ and unenviable read unthinkable in the minds of many if he sacrifices the high priests of tiki - taka , @entity95 and @entity96 , on the altar of accelerated pace , urgency and aggression			1
if the names of @entity106 , the only real speed merchant at the @entity109 academy of possession football , and @entity111 , the midfield energizer of @entity104 ’s remarkable season , take their places then it will be new - game on			0
perhaps he has still to make up his mind			0
maybe that was why he closed the doors of the @entity6 to prying eyes after the first 15 minutes of @entity3 ’s supposedly open training session there 24 hours before kick - off			1
@entity120 : @entity3 out ? @entity60 could lose his place in the starting line - up after a poor performance against @entity46 but he has laid the ground for such a possibility by saying : ‘ if we make changes after what happened in the second half against @entity46 we wo n’t be pointing a finger at anyone			1
all the players have our support but we have to manage the situation we are in			0
‘ we are capable of turning things around			0
we will keep doing several things the same way – but we are flexible			2
’ not unnaturally , given all their successes over the past six years , most of the players are defensive of a winning system			0
@entity141 will be the beneficiary if @entity43 comes to the conclusion that @entity143 was probably right all along and drops @entity144 after his horror show against the @entity146			2
@entity148 ’s goalkeeper says : ‘ this team is not dead			0
we will reverse the notion that this is the end of an era			0
’ @entity43 , one of the finest managers of any epoch , will be more open - minded			1
@entity154 was not his creation but that of @entity156 at @entity109 and @entity43 is not as wedded to it as the man who has taken the style on with him to @entity160			1
false nine : @entity161 could also be set for a starting place if both @entity60 and @entity58 are dropped versatile : @entity163 ( left ) and @entity58 hope @entity3 can win any we they can @entity166 : @entity163 this @entity37 inquisitor is very much his own man			1
he will be wise to the trends here			0
he will be aware that at the start of play on @entity173 of this tournament more than 40 goals had already been scored compared with barely 20 at the same stage in @entity176 four years ago , where @entity3 beat @entity46 with the only goal of the final			2
@entity43 will be acutely aware of why this is happening			2
he has seen @entity180 amplify the alliance of power , pace and non-stop work - rate to high - technique , which is now one trademark of the game			0
he was too close for comfort as @entity46 demonstrated another , counter-attacking at blistering speed			0
preparing : the @entity37 players train ahead of their match against @entity20 on wednesday shocker : @entity3 suffered a 5 - 1 defeat at the hands of @entity46 in @entity195 last week @entity163 summed it up best : ‘ at times , as well as keeping the ball , we will have to be faster and more direct			1
now we have to win anyhow that works			0
’ @entity20 are not unlike the @entity146 in that tactic			0
although not quite as adept on the break as @entity203 and @entity204 , these @entity201 do have a deadly rapier of a forward in @entity206 and they work flat out to supply him with chances			0
this is a dangerous game			0
so is changing a playing philosophy on the hoof			0
@entity43 may settle for injecting some additional quickness but without fundamentally altering @entity3 ’s basic structure			1
such a compromise would be fraught in itself but if anyone can pull off this trick without falling between two stools it is the manager from @entity219 .			0

@entity3 may have to lose their tiki - taka style if they are to *progress* further in the @entity17
@entity43 must decide whether to change his team *'s* style *mid-tournament*
@entity58 and @entity163 are prepared to play ' any way ' to get a win
@entity43 claims @entity3 will do things the same way but can be ' flexible '
