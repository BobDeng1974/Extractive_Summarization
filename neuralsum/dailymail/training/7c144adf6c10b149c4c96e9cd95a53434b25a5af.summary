by @entity0 , @entity1 editor the flags of @entity3 are being unfurled , supermarkets are bombarding us with special offers on beer and crisps , and the usual television schedules are about to be obliterated			0
in case you had n’t noticed , the @entity10 is about to kick off			0
but despite the relentless chatter and endless advertising onslaught , it seems the nation is n’t quite as behind the @entity18 team as you might expect			1
uninterested ? @entity18 fans at a @entity22 friendly - but not everyone is in the mood			1
a survey has found four in 10 @entity26 people do n't care about the team 's chances , and 30 per cent are n't supporting them at all for a survey claims that four in ten people living in @entity18 could n’t care less what happens to @entity32 and his team - mates when they kick off their campaign on saturday night			1
according to market researchers @entity35 , 30 per cent go as far as to say they will not be supporting @entity18 , while a further 9 per cent say they do not care either way what happens to @entity41 ’s side			1
older people are particularly turned off by the hype , with the over- 65s the least likely to care whether the @entity18 team make it to the latter stages of the tournament or return home humiliated			1
the survey found the @entity50 of @entity18 is the most patriotic area with two thirds saying they will be supporting the @entity18			1
the @entity52 ranks second and @entity54 third			0
perhaps unsurprisingly , support for @entity18 tails off even further among those living in @entity57 and @entity58			2
north of the border , some 72 per cent of people have taken an ‘ anyone but @entity18 ’ approach to the tournament , while 5 per cent said they had no strong opinion			1
and in @entity57 60 per cent of those surveyed said they did n’t care what happened to the @entity26			0
anticipation : @entity18 's @entity68 and @entity70 's @entity69 during a pre-tournament friendly the research suggests that even those @entity18 - based fans who are actively supporting the team may have adopted second teams to follow during the tournament in case @entity18 crash out early – with some surprising choices			1
@entity35 trends expert @entity80 said : ‘ many bookies have @entity18 as only third favourites to emerge from @entity83 , so there might be an element of @entity18 fans hedging their bets in declaring their support for “ second teams ”			1
’ he added : ‘ in @entity58 , 24 per cent are supporting a team other than @entity18 , and @entity58 supporters have traditionally embraced @entity92 and @entity93			1
‘ but we ’re also seeing @entity18 supporters adopt these former footballing enemies as their second teams – and this is likely to be due to the fact that they have several @entity101 stars in their ranks			2
’ the research suggests one reason for a reluctance to follow @entity18 is the poor behaviour of the fans , both at home and abroad			2
families are predicted to splash out £ 335million in a @entity10 spending spree that will include the latest supersize tvs , football shirts and party food and drink			0
new @entity115 will account for half of the spending at £ 170million , according to @entity35			2
@entity118 has already seen a 47 per cent rise in tv sales compared with last year			0
figures suggest families will spend an extra £ 300 each on average as a consequence of the @entity10			0
somewhere behind all those @entity18 flags is the home of patriotic football fan @entity127			1
the 46 - year - old spent weeks covering the entire front of his four - bedroom terraced property ( right ) with more than 300 flags , shirts and fluffy dice to cheer on the @entity18			2
the decorations even cover his front door and windows – but the @entity139 fan says the lack of sunlight is worth it			0
mr @entity127 , from @entity143 , said : ‘ i just wanted to show my support for the lads			0
’ his wife @entity146 , a carer aged 44 , hated the display at first but has now grown to love it			0
but neighbours still seem far from convinced			0
one said : ‘ i think it is a bit scruffy			0

researchers said 30 *%* of nation will not be supporting @entity18 team at all
older people are the most *immune* to the hype , especially the over- 65s
survey firm @entity35 said the @entity50 was the most patriotic area
