by @entity1 reporter published : 05:27 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 09:52 est , 7 may 2013 the @entity2 has accused @entity3 of sponsoring cyber-attacks on @entity6 government computers as part of a campaign of cyber-espionage			1
this is the first time the @entity2 's annual report has directly linked such attacks to the @entity14 government			1
the annual @entity2 report claims that at least some attacks on @entity6 government and other computer systems appeared to be ' attributable directly ' to the @entity3 government and military			1
the new wording in the report continues an escalating effort by @entity6 officials to call out the @entity3 on the cyber-attacks and to press for a more open dialogue with @entity14 on the problem			1
the @entity2 report also criticises a ' lack of transparency ' in @entity3 's military modernisation programme and defence spending			1
the report from the @entity6 @entity2 states : ' in 2012 , numerous computer systems around the world , including those owned by the @entity6 government , continued to be targeted for intrusions , some of which appear to be attributable directly to the @entity3 government and military			1
' @entity3 has rebuffed the claims , with its @entity57 repeating that it opposes cyber-attacks as well as ' all groundless accusations and hyping ' that could harm prospects for cooperation			1
suspicions : a hacking attack on the servers of @entity66 broadcasters and banks is believed to have come from @entity68			0
this shows a row of broken cash machines after the network shutdown ' we are willing to hold even - tempered and constructive dialogue with the @entity6 ' about cybercrime , a spokesman said			2
the issue was highlighted in february with the issuing of a report by cyber-security firm @entity80 that claimed to have traced several years of cyber-attacks against 140 mostly @entity6 companies to a @entity3 military unit in @entity84			1
the firm identified the @entity87 's @entity84 - based @entity86 as the most likely driving force behind the attacks			0
it said says the office block is linked to stolen technology blueprints , manufacturing processes , clinical trial results , pricing documents , negotiation strategies and other secret data from more than 100 companies			0
more alarmingly , it claimed the unit , known as the @entity86 , also made incursions into the computer networks that control oil pipelines , power grids , water plants and other pieces of key state infrastructure			0
hacked : the @entity109 office in @entity110			0
the newspaper has reported that its computer system was breached by @entity3 hackers @entity80 executives say attacks originating in @entity3 have continued since then , with the exception of those from @entity84 - based @entity86 that had been highlighted in its earlier report			2
@entity3 hackers were also accused of being responsible for hacking the @entity118 and the @entity109 earlier this year			0
and just last month , hacking attacks on the servers of @entity66 broadcasters and banks originated from an ip address based in @entity3			2
but @entity3 says it is impossible to tell the true origin of cyber-attacks , and accuses hostile forces of blaming it out of prejudice or a desire to put @entity14 on the defensive			0
senior col. @entity131 , a @entity87 researcher , described the accusations as ' irresponsible and harmful to the mutual trust ' between the two countries			0
col. @entity131 , who is based at the @entity135 in @entity14 , one of the @entity87 's main think tanks , told the official @entity138 : ' the @entity3 government and armed forces have never sanctioned hacking activities			2
' under attack : the @entity118 spent most of 2012 trying to deal with @entity3 hackers who infiltrated their computer network			0

@entity6 government computers and firms have been targeted in recent months
@entity2 claims attacks can be attributed directly to @entity3 government
it is the first time the @entity2 's annual report has linked attacks to @entity3 's government and military
@entity3 officials have rebuffed @entity6 's ' groundless accusations '
