footage has emerged from deep inside the mysterious crater that has suddenly appeared in @entity2			1
the crater on the @entity4 - known as the ' @entity5 ' to locals - was caused by aliens , a meteorite , a stray missile , or an explosive gas cocktail released due to global warming , according to theories last week			1
@entity14 scientists recently returned from the first expedition to look inside the giant hole which was previously spotted by helicopter			1
the two new craters follow the discovery of a larger hole earlier this month around 230ft ( 70 metres ) in diameter			1
now the new holes - smaller in diameter but similar in shape - are posing a fresh challenge for @entity14 scientists their footage highlights a darkening around the rim which was earlier seen as evidence of heat possibly from an explosion during the crater 's creation			1
' they found the crater - around up to 300ft ( 70 metres ) deep - has an icy lake at its bottom , and water is cascading down its eroding permafrost walls , ' said @entity47			1
‘ it is not as wide as aerial estimates which earlier suggested between 164ft and 328ft ( 50 and 100 metres )			0
’ @entity50 , senior researcher at the @entity51 of @entity52 , revealed that satellite mapping imagery is being used to establish when the phenomenon was formed , thought to be in the last year or two			2
this giant crater measuring around 262ft and found in far northern @entity2 is believed to have been caused by rising temperatures in the area - not a meteorite @entity59 , a senior researcher at the @entity60 of the @entity61 , who travelled to investigate the crater , said there were no traces of an explosion the discovery eliminates the possibility that a meteorite had struck the region in the @entity4 - the name of which translates as ' the @entity5 ' mr @entity50 said the enormous crater appears to be made up of 80 per cent ice which adds to the theory that it was caused by the effects of global warming the darkening around the inner rim of the crater also indicates ' severe burning ' which scorched the crater 's edges , researchers said the darkening around the inner rim of the crater indicates ' severe burning ' that scorched its edges one of the more popular theories is that the giant hole was caused by a phenomenon known as a pingo			1
this is a subsurface accumulation of ice that has been covered by land			0
when the ice melts it can leave behind a gaping hole that it once filled			0
the other favoured theory is that the hole was caused by an explosion of methane underground			1
the @entity4 is rich in natural gas , with its resources extensively tapped by @entity14 , and a mixture of water , salt and gas could result in an explosion			1
the other theory is that it was caused by a meteorite , but most experts have ruled this possibility out as the phenomenon does not resemble normal impact craters			2
' the crater has more of an oval than a circular shape , it makes it harder to calculate the exact diameter , ' he said			0
' as of now our estimates is about 98ft ( 30 metres )			0
if we try to measure diameter together with soil emission , the so - called parapet , then the diameter is up to 197ft ( 60 metres )			0
the structure is so fragile that the scientists could not climb deep into the lake and had to send a camera down instead			2
one theory is that the feature is a ‘ pingo , ’ reports the @entity132			0
a pingo is a large chunk of ice that is located underground that can create a hole in the ground when it melts			1
‘ certainly from the images i ’ve seen it looks like a periglacial feature , perhaps a collapsed pingo , ’ dr @entity139 of the @entity140 said			0
‘ this is obviously a very extreme version of that , and if there ’s been any interaction with the gas in the area , that is a question that could only be answered by going there			0
’ dr @entity50 added the hole was most likely the result of a ' build - up of excessive pressure ' underground , due to the region 's changing temperatures			1
he said 80 per cent of the crater appeared to be made up of ice and that there were no traces of an explosion			1
the discovery eliminates the possibility that a meteorite had struck the region			0
' could it be linked to the global warming ? well , we have to continue ourresearch to answer this question , ' said dr @entity50			0
' two previous summers - years 2012 and 2013 were relatively hot for @entity174 , perhaps this has somehow influenced the formation of the crater			2
@entity179 frost is seen near the hole in this photo			0
some said the hole could have been formed by a meteorite striking the spot , but that no longer seems to be the case scientists working at the site measure some of the soil and debris around the crater until the expedition took place , shown , scientists had been baffled by the appearance of the giant hole thanks to their readings ( shown ) the team now believes the cause was increasing temperatures it 's not yet known if this event , which scorched the ground nearby ( shown ) , could occur again in the area very remote : the crater has appeared in @entity174 - a large peninsula jutting into @entity61 waters , which is @entity14 's main production area for gas supplied to @entity211 the @entity212 is area known for its permafrost and pingos the mysterious hole is in the @entity217 , some 20 miles from the @entity219 gas field the predominant theory so far is that the feature is a ' pingo '			1
this is a large chunk of ice that is located underground that can create a hole in the ground when it melts ' but we have to do our tests and research first and then say it more definitively			1
' after the hole was discovered , there was speculation online about the crater indicating ' the arrival of a @entity238 craft '			0
ruling out extra-terrestrial intervention , dr @entity50 said : ' we can say for sure that under the influence of internal processes there was an ejection in the permafrost			0
' i want to stress that was not an explosion , but an ejection , so there was no heat released as it happened			0
' the latest expedition organised by the @entity174 authorities included experts from @entity14 's @entity254 of the @entity61 , and also the @entity255 of the @entity256			1
they took samples of soil , air and water from the scene and were accompanied by a specialist from @entity14 's @entity263			2
@entity264 from the @entity265 , previously said the crater was formed by a mixture of water , salt and gas igniting an underground explosion , a result of global warming			1
gas accumulated in ice could have mixed with sand beneath the surface , and then mixed with salt			2
global warming may have caused an ' alarming ' melt in the under - soil ice , released gas and causing an effect like the popping of a @entity287 bottle cork , ms @entity264 suggests			2
@entity174 , a large peninsula jutting into @entity61 waters , is @entity14 's main production area for gas supplied to @entity211			1
dr @entity50 said : ' i 've never seen anything like this , even though i have been to @entity174 many times			0
' the crater is different from others on @entity174			2
the experts say the phenomenon maybe a restarting of a process not seen for 8,000 years when the lake - pocked @entity174 landscape was formed on what was once a sea			2
this maybe ' repeating nowadays ' , he said			0
' if this theory is confirmed , we can say that we have witnessed a unique natural process that formed the unusual landscape of @entity4			0
' scientists are seen here on the way to the crater during their expedition shown is a piece of soil that was ' ejected ' out of the original crater			0
the crater is different from others on @entity174			0
the experts say the phenomenon maybe a restarting of a process not seen for 8,000 years when the lake - pocked @entity174 landscape was formed on what was once a sea here can be seen permafrost , soil below the freezing point of water , near the crater the edge of the terrifyingly large , original crater is seen here			1
one favoured theory is that the hole was caused by an explosion of methane underground a bird is seen here on top of the crater 's wall the @entity174 crater is visible in this aerial view another aerial view shows how out of place the hole looks in the environment			1

enormous crater appeared suddenly in part of @entity14 , @entity174 , where name translates as ' the @entity5 '
some thought the rare and unusual structure , which was up to 300ft ( 70 metres ) deep , was caused by a meteorite
@entity59 from @entity60 of the @entity61 says crater was formed due to rising temperatures
one theory is that a chunk of ice that is located underground that created a hole in the ground when it melted
another is that the crater was formed by a mixture of water , salt and gas igniting an underground explosion
recent expedition revealed that the crater has an icy lake at its bottom , and water is cascading down its walls
