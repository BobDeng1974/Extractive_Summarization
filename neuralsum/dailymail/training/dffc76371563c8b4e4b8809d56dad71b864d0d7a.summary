@entity0 says drone strikes in the @entity2 on @entity2 citizens are hypothetically possible , but only in extreme circumstances attorney general @entity0 says the @entity5 could kill @entity2 on their home soil using drone strikes			1
he did not rule out potential scenarios where a drone could target an @entity2 in the @entity2 , but said it has not happened so far and only in the most extreme of circumstances could he ever see it being considered			1
his comments came in testimony yesterday before the @entity15			0
senator @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , asked @entity0 whether he believed it would be constitutional to target an @entity2 terror suspect who was simply ' sitting at a cafe '			1
' no , ' @entity0 replied , calling the use of domestic drone strikes ' entirely hypothetical ' and adding that the government has no intention of carrying out drone strikes against its own citizens			1
his comments come in the wake of senator @entity29 demanding that he or the president or issue a statement assuring the unmanned aircraft would not be used in the @entity2 to kill @entity2 terrorism suspects as part of his 13 hour filibuster blocking the nomination of @entity38 as director of the @entity40			1
@entity29 started just before noon wednesday by demanding the president or attorney general @entity0 issue a statement assuring the unmanned aircraft would not be used in the @entity2 to kill terrorism suspects who are @entity2 citizens			1
he was n't picky about the format , saying at one point he 'd be happy with a telegram or a tweet			0
the @entity50 administration has said the federal government has not conducted such operations inside @entity2 borders and has no intention of doing so			1
@entity29 said he recognized that he ca n't stop @entity38 from being confirmed			1
but the nomination was the right vehicle for a debate over what the @entity50 @entity58 believes are the limits of the federal government 's ability to conduct lethal operations against suspected terrorists , he said			0
he spoke almost continuously for five hours before majority leader @entity76 tried but failed to move to a vote on @entity38			0
@entity29 snacked on candy at the dinner hour while continuing to speak			1
at one point , sen. @entity80 , @entity81 , who walks haltingly with a cane because of a stroke , delivered a canister of hot tea and an apple to @entity29 's desk , but a doorkeeper removed them			1
rep. @entity91 , a conservative from @entity18 , stood off to the side of the @entity15 floor in a show of support			0
other well - wishers with privileges to be on the floor shook his hand when he temporarily turned the speaking over to his colleagues			0
held up : @entity74 leaders had hoped to hold a final vote by the full @entity15 to confirm @entity38 ( pictured ) on wednesday sen. @entity16 , @entity103 , read @entity105 messages from people eager to ' @entity107			0
' the @entity108 , said @entity16 , is ' blowing up			0
' and as the night went on , @entity16 spoke for longer periods as @entity29 leaned against a desk across the floor			1
@entity16 , an insurgent @entity17 with strong tea party backing , read passages from @entity115 's ' @entity114 ' and lines from the 1970 movie ' @entity118 , ' starring @entity119			0
dressed in a dark suit , white shirt and red tie , @entity29 read from notebooks filled with articles about the expanded use of the unmanned weapons that have become the centerpiece of the @entity50 administration 's campaign against @entity131 suspects			1
as he moved about the @entity15 floor , aides brought him glasses of water , which he barely touched			0
@entity15 rules say a senator has to remain on the floor to continue to hold it , even though he can yield to another senator for a question			2
drones , unarmed craft that carry missiles , are a key weapon in the @entity2 @entity145 ' no president has the right to say he is judge , jury and executioner , ' @entity29 said			1
not all @entity17 were so enthusiastic about @entity29 's performance			1
sen. @entity151 , @entity152 , said the prospect of drones being used to kill people in the @entity2 was ' ridiculous ' and called the debate ' paranoia between libertarians and the hard left that is unjustified			1
' rep. @entity160 , @entity161 , the chairman of the @entity162 , echoed @entity151			0
he said it is unconstitutional for the @entity2 military or intelligence agencies to conduct lethal counterterrorism operations in the @entity2 against @entity2 citizens			1
suggesting they can or might , @entity160 said , ' provokes needless fear and detracts attention from the real threats facing the country			0
' the president , if the circumstances arose , could theoretically launch a drone strike on a @entity2 citizen on @entity2 soil later in the evening @entity29 , who is the son of former @entity18 congressman and libertarian leader @entity179 , offered to allow a vote on @entity38 if the @entity15 would vote on his resolution stating that the use of the unmanned , armed aircraft on @entity2 soil against @entity2 citizens violates the @entity186			1
@entity76 , @entity188 , said he planned to file a motion to bring debate over @entity38 's nomination to an end , if not on thursday , then friday or next week			0
@entity76 had pushed for a confirmation vote wednesday			0
technically , the @entity15 had not even started the debate on @entity38 's nomination before @entity29 took control of the floor almost immediately after @entity17 successfully blocked a vote on a federal appeals court nominee			2
along with @entity16 and @entity73 , @entity17 sens. @entity198 of @entity199 , @entity200 of @entity201 and @entity202 of @entity203 joined @entity29 briefly three hours into the debate but turned it back to him			2
@entity73 has long pressed for greater oversight of the use of drones			2
sen. @entity209 , @entity210 , appeared later in the evening to trade questions with @entity29			2
the record for the longest individual speech on the @entity15 floor belongs to former sen. @entity215 of @entity216 , who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the @entity217			0
@entity0 came close to making the statement @entity29 wanted earlier in the day during an exchange with @entity16 at a @entity15 hearing , according to @entity29			2
never - ending : @entity29 appears on a television screen in an office at the @entity2 @entity223 as he spoke for more than 13 hours on the @entity15 floor in opposition to @entity38 's nomination @entity16 asked @entity0 if the @entity186 allowed the federal government to kill a @entity2 citizen on @entity2 soil who does n't pose an imminent threat			1
@entity0 said the situation was hypothetical , but he did not think that in that situation the use of a drone or lethal force would be appropriate			2
@entity16 criticized @entity0 for not simply saying ' no ' in response			0
in a letter sent tuesday to @entity29 , @entity38 said the @entity40 does not have authority to conduct lethal operations inside the @entity2 @entity0 told @entity29 in a march 4 letter that the federal government has not conducted such operations and has no intention of doing so			1
but @entity0 also wrote that he supposed it was possible under an ' extraordinary circumstance ' that the president would have no choice but to authorize the military to use lethal force inside @entity2 borders			2
@entity0 cited the attacks at @entity252 and on sept. 11 , 2001 , as examples			0
@entity29 said he did not dispute that the president has the authority to take swift and lethal action against an enemy that carried out a significant attack against the @entity2			1
but @entity29 said he was ' alarmed ' at how difficult it has been to get the administration to clearly define what qualifies as a legitimate target of a drone strike			2
@entity38 's nomination won approval tuesday by the @entity266 after the @entity58 broke a lengthy impasse by agreeing to give lawmakers access to top - secret legal opinions justifying the use of lethal drone strikes against @entity131 suspects overseas			2
if confirmed , @entity38 would replace @entity272 , the @entity40 's deputy director who has been acting director since @entity274 resigned in november after acknowledging an affair with his biographer			0
@entity38 currently serves as @entity50 's top counterterrorism adviser in the @entity58			0
