by @entity0 published : 08:08 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 10:14 est , 9 march 2012 police will pay out a five - figure sum to the grieving family of @entity4 who killed herself and her disabled daughter after a decade of unchecked abuse by yobs			1
officers failed to protect the mother who turned her car into a fireball while she and 18 - year - old @entity12 , who had severe learning difficulties , sat inside			2
the pair , who were repeatedly targeted by gangs of youths , were found in a layby in october 2007 a couple of miles from their home in @entity21 , @entity22			0
ignored : @entity4 killed herself and her disabled daughter @entity23 , 18 , after a gang taunted them for ten years an inquest into their deaths two years later heard police were contacted 33 times in 10 years about anti-social behaviour - but the family only received eight visits from officers			2
a jury returned verdicts of suicide and unlawful killing , and said the response of @entity40 and two local councils had contributed to what happened			1
a claim for damages against the force on behalf of ms @entity4 's son , @entity47 , 21 , who has learning difficulties , and her mother , @entity50 , 74 , was lodged at the @entity51 last year			2
it sought damages of between £ 15,000 and £ 50,000 , and alleged there was a ' substantial chance ' ms @entity4 and her daughter would not have died if officers had taken decisive action			2
the papers stated : ' @entity4 was driven to take this tragic action by the stress and anxiety she was suffering as a result of on - going anti-social behaviour , harassment , victimisation and bullying			0
' @entity40 tried to have the application dismissed , arguing its officers could not have foreseen that ms @entity4 would kill herself and her daughter			1
the bodies of @entity4 , 38 , and her daughter @entity72 , 18 , were discovered in a burnt out car but the force has now settled the claim with what is believed to be a five - figure sum , although it stopped short of admitting liability			2
the family 's solicitor , @entity79 , said : ' it was important for the family to achieve justice after going through a horrendous few years following the deaths of @entity4 and @entity12 and it has given them a modicum of financial security going forward			1
' the case also had enormous public interest because of public concern about the treatment of vulnerable and disabled people in society , and the case dealt with what duties the police have to protect people like @entity4 and her family from anti-social behaviour and hate crime			0
' ms @entity4 was driven to taking her own life and the life of her daughter @entity12 after being bullied by a teenage gang in @entity21			0
this was their house the family 's claim stated that as a result of the alleged breaches by @entity40 , they suffered ' a very real loss of very close and loved family members and resulting grief and bereavement '			1
it contained details of dozens of incidents reported by the family between 1997 and 2007			0
it added : ' over the entire period there were numerous occasions on which @entity4 and @entity12 did not leave their home as @entity4 was so anxious about the abuse and anti-social behaviour they would otherwise suffer			0
' @entity40 were accused of failing in their duty , under @entity131 of the @entity132 , to have suitable systems in place for investigating , controlling and suppressing harassment of members of the public - in particular vulnerable ones - and for managing the effects of such harassment on them			1
following an @entity143 probe , four @entity40 officers faced misconduct charges			1
but they were cleared after a series of internal hearings			0
an @entity143 report also found that the force had failed to identify ms @entity4 and her daughter as vulnerable			0
speaking after its hearings , @entity152 , deputy chief constable of @entity40 , said the failings were of ' an organisational nature due to the systems and processes in place at the time '			1
speaking after today 's announcement , @entity22 police chief constable @entity158 said : ' i can confirm that the civil claim has been settled out of court – this has been done without admission of liability			1
' this is a tragic case and i felt that it was the right thing to do to , for everyone concerned , to draw a line under the litigation			0
' since the sad events in october 2007 the force has made significant changes to the way anti-social behaviour is dealt with and the way in which vulnerability is identified to ensure that the right support is given			0

@entity40 will pay but have *n't* admitted liability
@entity183 's solicitor said ' achieving justice ' was important
it comes after four officers were cleared of misconduct
