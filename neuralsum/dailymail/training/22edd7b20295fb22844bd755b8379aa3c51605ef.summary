by @entity0 professor sir @entity1 said studies had created ' misleading uncertainty ' over statins doctors are putting lives at risk by exaggerating the side effects of statins , an expert warns			1
professor sir @entity1 said recent studies had created ' misleading uncertainty ' about the drugs			1
he claimed unjustified concerns about side effects meant statins were not being prescribed enough , possibly causing more deaths than the @entity17 scandal			1
but critics accused him of ' fear - mongering ' , and said it was important for patients to be warned about the potential dangers			0
more than seven million @entity23 with high cholesterol take statins to cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes			1
the @entity28 says the drugs save 7,000 lives a year			0
proposed changes to prescription guidelines mean they could soon be prescribed to 12million patients			0
but two recent articles in the @entity35 have claimed statins cause harmful side effects , and do not necessarily reduce mortality			1
professor @entity1 , of @entity40 , said the papers by @entity42 , from @entity43 , and @entity23 cardiologist @entity44 were misleading			1
he added : ' statins are given to people at elevated risk of heart attacks and strokes			2
' if people at elevated risk stop taking their statins – or do n't start taking their statins – then they will have unnecessary heart attacks and strokes , there will be unnecessary deaths from vascular causes			1
this is a serious disservice to medicine			0
' he said the uncertainty over statins was more serious than the @entity17 scare , when a researcher claimed the jabs could cause autism , leading to many parents refusing to have their children vaccinated			1
he added : ' the papers are far worse in terms of the harm they have done , and [ the uncertainty ] is probably killing more people ... than that on the @entity17 vaccine			1
' @entity35 editor dr @entity77 said the articles were well referenced and peer reviewed , and insisted that significant medical issues deserved to be debated openly			0
( @entity83 picture ) more than seven million @entity23 with high cholesterol take statins to cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes she added : ' it 's important that the public understand when we 're talking about extending statins to people at low risk , that the balance between benefits and harms becomes much more important			1
' statins are offered to those with a 20 per cent risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next ten years			2
but following a study by professor @entity1 , health chiefs recommended in february that they should be given to those with a 10 per cent risk			1
but critics say over-prescribing to low - risk patients could lead to muscle weakness , kidney problems , diabetes and depression			0
dr @entity42 said his study showed statins did not cut deaths by much , adding : ' dr @entity1 is fear - mongering when he says lives will be lost as a result of our calculations			1
' @entity44 , of @entity118 in @entity119 , said pills were a poor substitute for a good diet and more exercise			0
but analysis at @entity125 of 29 trials of statins involving more than 80,000 people said the drugs had almost no side effects			2
statins could ease the symptoms of lung - disease patients , researchers said last night			2
they found the drugs could be an alternative to long - term antibiotic treatment for those with chronic lung problems			0
although statins are prescribed for people at risk of heart attack , they also have anti-inflammatory properties			2
researchers at the @entity145 gave the drugs to patients with a lung condition known as bronchiectasis			0
the life - threatening and disabling disease affects one in 1,000 adults , leading to inflammation in the lungs and airways that causes debilitating coughing fits and chest infections			0
the team found a high daily dose of statins over six months reduced the amount of coughing for 12 out of the 30 patients in the study			1
patients could also better tolerate gentle exercise and walk further than before , and had fewer flare - ups of the disease and less inflammation in their airways			0
@entity170 stopped taking statins before the study ended because of side effects such as headaches , but there were no serious adverse reactions			2
the findings , published today in the journal @entity178 , suggest statins could offer an alternative to long - term antibiotic treatment , which raises the risk of infection from antibiotic - resistant strains of bacteria such as mrsa or clostridium difficile			0
the cause of bronchiectasis is not known for most patients , but it has been linked to infections such as whooping cough and pneumonia			0
study leader dr @entity193 said : ' there are few effective treatments for bronchiectasis , so these are encouraging findings			0
larger studies are needed to find out whether statins could be useful as a long - term treatment for patients			2
