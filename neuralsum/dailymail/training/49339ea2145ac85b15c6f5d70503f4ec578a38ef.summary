' they were just using a regular roof box and set up pitch right by the beach			0
' for two weeks the roof box was redundant			0
' but as a yacht surveyor i had the mad thought that it may be possible to design a roof box that could also be a boat			2
' there are two models of the box - a 650 litre version and a 700 litre version - which both come with a set of oars , rowlocks , the necessary hinges and securing clasps			0

' it 's a genuinely good product - no more expensive than a posh roof box on the high street and yet it is so much more			0
' it is a really large roof box - just about the biggest available and it is also very strong			0
' both versions of the box come with a set of oars , rowlocks , the necessary hinges and securing clasps			0
