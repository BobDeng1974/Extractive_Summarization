in the @entity1 , @entity0 transports herself back to @entity2 by clicking the heels of her ruby slippers three times			0
and while this is clearly fiction , designers have created the next best thing - a device that calls you a taxi simply by hitting your feet together			0
called @entity0 , the system features an accelerometer that can be attached to any shoe and connects to a smartphone app to call a cab automatically			2
@entity0 was created by @entity20 - based @entity19 and is powered by an @entity22 micro-controller with a built - in @entity24 chip , accelerometer , and a cell battery , all inside a clip called @entity29			1
the @entity29 attaches to any shoe ( pictured ) and connects wirelessly to the @entity32 app @entity0 is the brainchild of @entity34 , managing director at @entity20 - based @entity19			1
it powered by the @entity36 - an @entity22 micro-controller with a built - in @entity24 chip , inside a clip called @entity29			1
this system also features an accelerometer , and a coin cell battery			2
the @entity29 clips onto any shoe and connects wirelessly to the @entity32 app. a ‘ trigger ’ is activated using three distinct clicks of the heel , but these triggers can be customised			1
a ‘ trigger ’ is activated using three clicks of the heel , and these triggers can be customised			2
the prototype version ’s triggers include receiving a call , sending a template text to three friends , or ordering a taxi ( pictured ) , but the firm is working on developing more options @entity0 is powered by the @entity36 - an @entity22 micro-controller inside a @entity29 insert			1
it also features an accelerometer , and a cell battery			2

the prototype version ’s triggers include receiving a call , sending a template text to three friends or ordering an @entity75 taxi			1
when the onboard accelerometer detects clicks , it sends a signal to the connected phone via @entity24			0
the prototype version ’s triggers include receiving a call , sending a template text to three friends , or ordering an @entity75 taxi			1
when the onboard accelerometer detects clicks , it sends a signal to the connected phone via @entity24 and the action is automatically taken			0
@entity75 uses the gps on the user ’s phone to know where to send the car			0
@entity34 said @entity0 can also be used to get out of an awkward situation , by faking a phone call discreetly , and it can even be used a security measure to alert people when the wearer is in trouble			0
‘ while this is our initial prototype , we ’re currently exploring models as small as third of its current size , potentially built into an insole , ’ explained @entity34			2
@entity34 told @entity108 that the priority is to make the device smaller before discussing a release date or price			1
he did add that in the ‘ near future ’ , he ’s planning to add extra trigger actions such as ordering a pizza			0
he is also asking people to suggest triggers via the @entity0 homepage			0
the @entity0 gadget was inspired by the ruby slippers worn by @entity121 in the 1939 film @entity1 ( pictured )			0
