' i look better than ever and i work out less			1
i ’m never in the gym for [ more than ] 45 minutes , ' she said			1
' as i ’ve gotten older , i ’ve learned that it ’s about being physical every day			1
you do n’t have to go to the gym if that ’s not your thing			2
you can go outside your door and walk around your block			2
' one thing that @entity8 was keen to open up about in the interview with the magazine was her husband , @entity9 , explaining that their relationship is stronger now than ever , despite the rumours that have persistently dogged their 17 - year romance			1
better than ever : although she displays an enviably toned physique in the new imagery , @entity8 maintains that she takes a relaxed approach to her fitness and never works out for longer than 45 minutes relaxed approach to fitness : @entity8 says that as she has gotten older , she 's learned that it 's about being physical every day - even if that means going for a brisk walk strong bond : over the years , she and @entity9 have been accused of unfounded infidelities , of having an ' open marriage ' and have even had their sexualities questioned , all of which she shrugs off ' @entity9 , to me , encompasses everything			1
it ’s almost as if calling him " my husband " is too small of a word for what he means in my life , ' she said			2
married for 17 years , she reveals how their relationship has changed over time			2
' we used to have all these rules , [ but ] as you go on in your relationship , you just get into a flow … i had a very stuck idea of what a husband looks like , what a wife should be			2
' once i broke all of that , a whole new world opened for me and man , oh , man , i got to see him in all his glory			2
and so that ’s what it ’s evolved into			0

we can laugh because it ’s so ridiculous			0
i do n’t take it personally			0
' female empowerment : @entity8 puts her fame and power to good use - she once visited @entity118 to testify on sex trafficking and now she 's working with @entity120 on a documentary about it as well as the state of their own marriage , the @entity8 ’s were at the centre of media scrutiny earlier this year when 13 - year - old daughter @entity128 found herself amidst controversy when an @entity131 picture of herself in bed next to topless 20 - year - old actor @entity133 went viral			1

you guys are projecting your trash onto it … and you 're acting like covert paedophiles and that 's not cool			0
