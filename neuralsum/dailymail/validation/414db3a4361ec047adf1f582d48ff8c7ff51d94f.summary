a creepy video shows how a black spider , believed to be a @entity2 , refusing to let the force of the powerful flush button get the better of the courageous critter			1
the extraordinary fight in the creature would be admirable if it was not so scary as it does n't matter how many times it gets dumped into the toilet bowl the spider wo n't give up			1
the spine - tingling footage of the eight - legged furry fella suggests that maybe spiders also have nine lives as it keeps coming back for more as it keeps springing back into action			0
the creepy crawly appears from under the toilet bowel due to the pressure of the flush and get dumped into the water ( left ) and then climbs it way up thee porcelain several times with gangly legs ( right ) as soon as the flush button is pressed the creepy crawly appears from under the toilet bowel due to the pressure when it seems safe to presume it only has a matter of seconds before disappearing down the pipe and never to be seen again			1
just when you think you can let your guard down - the spider fights extremely hard for its life by desperately trying to cling onto the side of the porcelain with its legs as it lands in the water numerous times			0
when the flushing stops the spider curls into a ball and leads you to believe that it has surrendered to the violent loo but then suddenly bounces back to life and climbs back up the bowl			2
the critter kept going into a ball which misled you to believe that all was lost but then miraculously stretch its long legs all the way to the top of the bowel but the remaining running water knocks it back down again and the spider goes back into a ball for long enough to think that it has to be all over for creepy critter by now			1
after being washed back down a few more times it manages to miraculously stretch its gangly legs and stride up the bowl yet again			0
when the spider realises that it 's free of the dreaded giant flush - the exhausted creature takes a few seconds to catch it 's breath before going back up under the bowl - the opposite side to where it appeared at the beginning of the traumatic experience			2

black spider appears from under toilet bowl as the flush button is pressed
believed to be a @entity2 , it gets *repeatedly* *dunked* into the water
but the dark creepy crawly continues to fight for its life over and over again
every time it looks to have lost all hope the critter sprang back into action
