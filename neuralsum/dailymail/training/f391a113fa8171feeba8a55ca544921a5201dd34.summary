by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 29 march 2012 updated : 02:11 est , 30 march 2012 @entity2 mp : ' they think we are better off , they think we are toffs ' @entity5 and his cabinet are seen as well - fed toffs living in a different world , @entity2 warned last night			1
in a devastating analysis , the former @entity10 leadership contender said the prime minister needed to ‘ get a grip ’ in order to convince voters he shared their fears and aspirations			1
mr @entity2 said appearing out of touch could damage the prime minister ’s prospects , just as sleaze had undermined @entity24 ’s premiership			1
although the intervention has angered @entity10 high command , senior officials admit mr @entity5 is aware of the dangers and will push working - class ministers into the political frontline over the coming weeks			1
in an interview with the @entity32 , mr @entity2 warned that @entity34 decisions to cut the top rate of tax while imposing a ‘ granny tax ’ and a ‘ pasty tax ’ have created a new class divide and left poor and middle income earners feeling like they have been ‘ pushed off the escalator ’			1
he also warned that the decision to cut child benefit had convinced voters that @entity46 mr @entity5 and chancellor @entity47 ‘ do n’t know how we feel and work , what our lives are like ’			1
man of the people ? @entity52 may munch a pastry - but can @entity5 keep a grip on his party 's image ? mr @entity2 , who grew up in a council flat , said : ‘ it ’s an unfair allegation , but it ’s a powerful one , and it works against us			1
they think we ’re toffs			2
‘ the truth is , they look at the front bench , they see them all very well dressed , well turned out , well fed , and perhaps feel that they ’re in a different world to them			0
@entity69 undermined @entity24 - could ' being a toff ' undo @entity5 ? the “ we ’re all in this together ” phrase is very important – but at the moment it ’s not working			1
‘ governments always have to watch this , that they do n’t get stuck with an impression that plays against them			0
in @entity24 ’s day it was sleaze			2
today this may be its equivalent			0
if it sticks it makes almost everything you do impossible to make work			0
’ a senior government source indicated that @entity87 with more humble backgrounds would now put the case to voters that the @entity87 are on their side			0
foreign secretary @entity92 is expected to be asked to undertake more media appearances , along with communities secretary @entity94 and party chairman @entity95			2
‘ take a step back and look at people like @entity92 , @entity94 , @entity99 ( chief whip ) and @entity95 , ’ the source said			0
‘ people do n’t care about the prime minister ’s background			2
what they care about is that he is competent and he has got a grip			2
’ but @entity10 mp @entity104 , secretary of the @entity105 , warned the best option was a ministerial reshuffle to get ‘ greater representation of people from all sorts of backgrounds ’ on the front bench			0
’ @entity112 : @entity113 to represent the pasty eaters he said : ‘ those people that perhaps have struggled at some point in their life to pay the electric bill or have perhaps arrived in school in a @entity121 rather than a @entity122 are more likely to have empathy with those people who are currently struggling			2
’ doubts were also expressed about @entity47 ’s chancellorship and his prospects of succeeding mr @entity5			1
‘ @entity47 is no longer fit to be prime minister , ’ one junior minister told the @entity129			0
mr @entity5 faced fresh embarrassment over the ‘ pasty tax ’ last night after his main justification for the raid collapsed			1
he has claimed it was simply ironing out a loophole that has existed since @entity137 imposed vat on hot fast food in 1984			0
but @entity140 last night released a letter written by @entity137 from that year showing he had never intended pasties to be hit			0
the letter said : ‘ it does not apply to food and drink which has cooled to room temperature by the time it is sold , or to things like pies and pastries which are sold warm because they happen to be freshly baked .			0

former party leader @entity151 warns @entity5 to ' get a grip ' on @entity153
' it ’s not an *insuperable* *problem* yet , but it ’s one they ’ve got to solve - they think we *'re* toffs '
follows fuel *shortage* panic and anger from pasty fans over vat
