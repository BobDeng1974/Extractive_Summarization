the earliest recorded supernova was viewed by @entity2 astronomers in 185 ad , but today stellar explosions can be captured using telescopes - even those small models set up in amateur astronomers ' gardens			1
this incredible series of photographs were shot from one man 's back yard and show spectacular clouds of gas surrounding stars			1
@entity15 captured supernovae , which are normally invisible to the naked eye , over the course of the past year from his home in @entity20			1
out of this world ! this incredible series of supernovae photographs were shot from a back garden and show spectacular clouds of gas surrounding stars			1
a supernova is the explosion of a star and the largest explosion that takes place in @entity31 are often seen in other galaxies but are problematic to spot in the @entity33 because dust blocks our view the 70 - year - old research chemist used different filters on this five telescopes to draw attention to the shapes and patterns created by different gases that have absorbed energy from nearby stars			1
‘ i shot these images from the comfort of my back garden and because i love to see the pretty figures and shapes in the night 's sky , ’ mr @entity15 said			1
‘ the gases , hydrogen , oxygen and sulphur in these nebulae absorb the light energy from the nearby stars and re-emit it at very distinct wavelengths , ’ he explained			1

two of his works of art are pictured above to get his professional - looking images , mr @entity15 takes three separate images using his array of telescopes , sometimes on different nights			1
he uses filters to select different wavelengths and then layers up his images to make the perfect picture ( shown above ) ‘ my filters select for each of these wavelengths			1
so i take three separate images , usually on three separate nights to get the perfect images			2
’ the telescopes are connected to a computer , which applies a colour to each filter			0
mr @entity15 then combines the images so that one multi-coloured picture including all three gases is @entity105 images are called @entity107 palette pictures			1
mr @entity15 spends all night out on his deck taking pictures with an exposure as long as 15 minutes			2
it has to be very long to allow as much light in as possible , so the telescope has enough light to capture the shapes clearly			0
one picture can be the culmination of three nights or up to 20 hours work			0
a supernova is the explosion of a star and the largest explosion that takes place in space			1

a supernova ( pictured ) occurs in two different ways when there is a change in the core of a star			2
the first type happens in binary star systems - two stars that orbit the same point - when one of the stars - a white dwarf - steals matter from its companion			1
eventually the white dwarf acquires too much matter and explodes in a supernova a supernova occurs in two different ways when there is a change in the core of a star			2

alternatively , an explosion is caused at the end of a star 's lifetime			0
as it runs out of nuclear fuel , some of its mass flows into its core , which becomes so heavy that it ca n't withstand its own gravitational force			0
the core collapses , resulting in a supernova			0

scientists have also determined that supernovae play a key role in distributing elements throughout the universe			0
when the star explodes , it shoots elements and debris into space that travel through space to form new stars and planets			2

when the star explodes , it shoots elements and debris into space and many of them found on @entity219 are made from the core of stars			2
these elements travel on to form new stars , planets and everything else in the universe			0

@entity15 captured the stellar explosions , which are normally invisible to the naked eye
he used five telescopes set up in his back garden in @entity20 to see the incredible sights
the 70 - year - old amateur astronomer used different filters on this five telescopes to draw attention to the shapes and patterns created by different gases that have absorbed energy from nearby stars
he takes images *focusing* on different wavelengths which he layers up to create the perfect supernova images
