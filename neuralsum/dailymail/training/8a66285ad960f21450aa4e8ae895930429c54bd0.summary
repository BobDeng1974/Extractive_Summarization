by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 20:11 est , 15 january 2013 you 're picking your way carefully along an icy pavement when suddenly – thwack ! – a snowball thrown by an unseen hand hits you on the back of the head			1
as you stop to dry off , you look round for the pesky little brat who threw it , but there ’s no one to be seen			1
irritating , of course , but hardly a matter for the police ... unless , that is , you live in @entity16			1
spoil sports : these children had fun in the snow but youngsters in @entity22 could be arrested if they are caught throwing snowballs ( file pic ) the force there provoked derision yesterday after threatening to arrest children found throwing snowballs at cars or bystanders			1
it announced that its officers would crack down on anyone caught lobbing them at those who do n’t wish to partake in a snowball fight			2
posting a message on @entity42 , police from the @entity38 in the town of @entity40 said : ‘ @entity43 are aware that it has been snowing and that people are going to have fun in it , however if anyone is caught throwing snowballs at vehicles or on to the road , they could be arrested			1
' likewise , if anyone throws snowballs at persons ’ homes or at people who do not want to be involved in the snow games , they could be arrested and it will be classed as anti-social behaviour			2
’ an arrest for anti-social behaviour is normally dealt with by a fixed penalty order			2
but the police warning received widespread ridicule online , with residents saying that throwing snowballs was a centuries - old tradition that could not be stopped by a @entity42 message			1
one , @entity67 of @entity68 , said : ‘ what an absolute joke			2
i ca n’t believe the times we live in that police would see fit to make such a ridiculous pronouncement online			1
‘ i can understand them doing it if people had put stones in the snowballs , but that ’s not what they mean , is it ? ’ no joke : @entity83 publised on its @entity42 page that children would be arrested if they were caught throwing snowballs @entity87 , of @entity88 , accused officers of ‘ sucking the fun from everything ’			1
and @entity92 said : ‘ we ’ve had one thrown through our slightly ajar backdoor and it knocked the fabric softener off the top of the tumble dryer			2
i would have done the same when i was younger			0
’ @entity101 said they did not want to spoil fun or ban snowballs completely , but were simply issuing advice			1
a spokesman said : ‘ it might seem like innocent fun but it could have serious consequences			1
the problem in @entity40 is no worse than anywhere else , but the team thought they would head the problem off at the pass			0
’ no arrests have yet been made			0
the move came after plummeting night - time temperatures and snowfall across large parts led to treacherous conditions on the roads and underfoot			0
and while much of the country escaped any serious snowfall yesterday , it remained bitterly cold			0
in parts of @entity126 , residents were bracing themselves for temperatures of @entity128 ( @entity129 ) tonight			0
in @entity131 more than 40 schools were forced to close for the day and @entity133 airport also had to shut for a time			0
the @entity135 estimated it has seen a 30 per cent rise in the number of breakdowns since the cold snap started , while the @entity140 has put extra patrols on the roads			0
the @entity143 has a 500 - strong fleet of salt spreaders and snowploughs on standby			0
the @entity147 issued an amber weather warning , predicting severe weather for all of @entity150			0
the icy conditions are likely to last into the weekend and beyond , with a risk of snow and ice next week .			0
