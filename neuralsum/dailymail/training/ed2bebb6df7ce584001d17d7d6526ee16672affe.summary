by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 nearly 900 footballers in @entity3 are out of contract next month with many of them still unsure of their futures			1
the majority are already aware they will not receive a new deal and the players ’ union , the @entity10 , will be braced for another summer of upheaval when the final figures are confirmed at the end of the month			1
it is a stunning reminder of the uncertain world of professional football , where in recent summers around 500 footballers have been searching for new clubs			1
there is @entity32 leaving @entity33 and @entity34 departing from @entity35			1
there are young professionals who have been unable to break through into the @entity38 and are looking at their options			1
players like @entity41 , who is leaving @entity42 and looking to go abroad after loan spells at @entity44 in @entity45 and @entity46 in @entity47			1
there are established @entity50 stars like @entity51			0
wait : @entity24 's @entity23 contract is running out but he is expected to sign a new deal the 28 - year - old striker scored five goals in five games for @entity57 at the end of the season but is not wanted by new manager @entity60			1
there are those like @entity63 who will call it a day at the end of full and rewarding careers — and many more forced to accept at a young age that they will not have a career in the game			1
this will be the area where the @entity10 ’s expertise and specific exit and retraining programmes are vital to many individuals			0
much flux surrounds promotion and relegation issues — those clubs in the play - off finals do not yet know which division they will be in — and down the pyramid the trend is towards short contracts which guard against a sudden worsening of fortunes			2
this appeals to experienced players seeking new challenges , like @entity90			2
he has turned down a year at @entity92 for a one - year deal at @entity94 , and another season at the top at the age of 35			0
@entity98 and @entity99 are poised to sign new deals at promoted @entity94 , while 31 - year - old @entity101 seems set to opt for the security of a longer deal at @entity104 rather than another 12 months at @entity94			0
the influx of foreign players has limited the opportunities for @entity109 players but some , like @entity110 21 international @entity41 , are willing to broaden their horizons and look overseas for opportunities , and not only on the well - trodden routes into @entity115			2
going : @entity35 have confirmed that @entity34 ( left ) and @entity116 will leave the club out of favour : @entity32 joins the long list of players who will be released by their clubs off : @entity51 is n't wanted by @entity60 despite an impressive run in the @entity57 side ‘ i ’ve not really been looking in @entity3 because i do n’t want to stay here , ’ said @entity41 , on loan at @entity46 until the end of this month			1
the @entity47 club are managed by former @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity132 striker @entity131 , but the versatile 21 - year - old @entity41 expects his future to be elsewhere			2
‘ i ’ve been looking around @entity134 a lot , ’ he said			0
‘ i prefer it abroad and the football is more suited to my style of play			0
there has been interest from @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			0
you ca n’t limit yourself			0
people get blinkers on and just want to play in @entity3			1
on the move : @entity90 has signed for @entity94 after leaving @entity92 ' i want to play in the @entity38 , of course i do			0
it is the best in the world and it ’s where everyone wants to play - but there are other options			2
‘ there are lots of places to go and play football at a high level where you can experience other cultures and lifestyles			0
personally , i could n’t have asked for more from my loan experiences in @entity47 and @entity45			0
’ others have taken a similar route			0
@entity171 - born @entity170 played in @entity146 last year after joining @entity172 from @entity173 and @entity174 , son of former @entity3 international @entity175 , signed for @entity176 in @entity177			1
calling it a day : @entity179 forward @entity63 joins the list of retiring players			2

@entity22 , @entity32 and @entity34 will all be searching for new clubs
