fine at @entity1 car park : @entity2 , 54 a disabled pensioner was given a £ 90 parking fine for taking too long to shop at @entity1			1
@entity2 , 85 , who suffers from osteoarthritis , went shopping for @entity8 presents and food with her daughter @entity3 , 54 , at the supermarket ’s store in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the mother - of - two - who admits she is ‘ slow ’ and takes more time than an average person to get up and down the aisles - was shocked after a letter came in the post a week after their trip			1
the pair , who admit not noticing the signs in the car park which notified customers of a 90 - minute free parking restriction , had already spent £ 95.88 in the store when they broke the time limit by 15 minutes			1
mrs @entity30 said : ‘ i am very upset , i am very angry and i do not think it is fair what happened to us			1
i walk with a stick and i take a very long time to get around places			2
‘ i rely on my daughter to take me around and now she has been given a ticket because of me			0
i feel awful and i feel like a burden to her			0
it is a horrible thing to feel all because of a parking ticket			2
‘ it takes me a lot longer to get round the shops than a normal person and i was doing a big shop because i wanted to stock up for @entity8			1
my daughter was also very angry			0
‘ there was no ticket on the car but we got a letter in the post around a week later			0
we were only 15 minutes over the time , and it is so unfair that we have been fined			1
‘ it is a shame because i will not be going back to the shop again and they have lost my money now			0
it has been a very stressful time for me and my family - this is a lot of money			1
supermarket : @entity1 said that customers who have overstayed in one of its car parks should ' provide us with proof of purchase and we will appeal the charge on their behalf ' ( file picture of a @entity1 store ) ‘ we have basically paid double for the shopping just because i am slow			2
i am so very upset and angry			0
’ her daughter , a printer , who lives with her mother in @entity12 , said : ‘ i have never had a fine before and we had no idea there was a limit			1
‘ my main concern at the time was getting my mother in and out of the shop			2
if i ’d known , i would n’t have taken her there because she is handicapped and it takes time with an older person to go round a shop			1
‘ she ’d not been there before and wanted to have a good nosey round and we ended up spending a lot of money			0
‘ i appreciate that the store is near the station and they do n’t want people taking spaces for too long but other supermarkets give customers two - and - a - half to three hours			2
‘ it would be pretty obvious to anyone who saw us on camera that my mother walks with a stick and is slow			0
but i ’ve been to @entity1 and they ’ve said it ’s all done by a private company and it ’s nothing to do with them			0
‘ during this season people are doing bigger and longer shops than they normally do so i want to make people aware of the situation because the signs are not obvious			0
’ previous incident : blind @entity112 ( left ) , 73 , told the @entity114 in august how her carer @entity115 ( right ) got a £ 90 fine because they had exceeded the 60 minutes allowed in a @entity1 car park in @entity118 , @entity119 a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ while the vast majority of our store car parks do not have any car park management systems in place , we do have procedures in place in a small number of our store car parks , to help manage the availability of car parking spaces and ensure that our customers take priority			1
‘ some of these car parks are managed by ourselves or accredited contractors and some are managed by our landlords			0
in retail parks where we do not own the car parks , we are , consequently , not in charge of the management of those car parks			0
‘ we do however encourage any genuine @entity1 customers who have received a parking charge notice to get in touch with us directly via our customer services hotline number			2
‘ customers who have overstayed in one of our car parks should then just provide us with proof of purchase and we will appeal the charge on their behalf			0
‘ customers who have special requirements and may have difficulty with the parking restrictions in place should also get in touch with our customer services team who will find a solution to their car parking needs			0
’ it is not the first incident of its kind - after a blind pensioner who needs a carer to help her around supermarkets received a parking fine at another @entity1 store because she took too long to shop			1
