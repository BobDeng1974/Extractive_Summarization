after missing the win over @entity4 , the world ’s leading fly - half @entity0 is expected to return to the @entity5 controls against @entity6 at @entity7 this weekend			1
the @entity5 camp were tight - lipped on their team , to be announced on thursday but , while some leading names are expected to be rested , the man who took over the ‘ no 1 - @entity11 ’ tag from @entity10 is in line to continue his recovery from a leg fracture			1
having made it clear that he would not divulge the team early , backs coach @entity20 was then asked how he would like @entity0 to play against @entity6			1
all @entity5 star @entity0 could make his comeback against @entity6 at @entity7 this weekend @entity0 carries the ball in training while his team - mates close him down during session in @entity27 @entity0 watches on as team - mate @entity28 receives attention from physio @entity30 smiling , he replied : ‘ i guess you are asking me what i want our 10 ( stand - off ) to do on saturday … regardless of who plays			1
‘ i think we ’ve stated before that we are keen for @entity0 to get significant game time on this tour so , whether he ’s starting or off the bench he ’s likely to be there in some form , but for him he ’s got to just carry on doing what he ’s doing			1
‘ he took some good steps in @entity46 and i think he got a lot of confidence out of getting back on the park and getting used to the systems			2
it [ the @entity6 game ] is clearly going to be a pretty significant step - up from that so it ’s just getting timing , getting used to the speed of the defence coming at you and still getting your focus to give yourself a chance to make the right decisions			1
those are the little things that just come from time in the saddle			2
‘ it ’s not easy – it does n’t matter how many @entity68 you have played – to come back in after a break and perform , and so i guess both @entity0 and @entity71 have been asking lots of questions			1
‘ but mainly it is just getting them feeling the way the team is flowing and getting their involvement in that			2
i think we ’ve been able to speed up the process , largely because of their attitude and their desire to get it right			2
’ @entity20 , whose playing career spanned the amateur and pro eras at @entity88 and the @entity89 , leads on the @entity5 attack and he admitted that he was impressed with what he saw from @entity6 in their five - try , 41 - 31 win over @entity93 on saturday - especially the way in which the core of @entity97 players had carried their club form into the test arena			1
@entity0 took part in a kicking practice session at @entity103 at the end of last week the 32 - year - old brought on water for his team - mates during @entity5 's win against @entity4 ‘ i think they certainly showed the benefits of that combination , ’ he said of the virtually all - warriors back line			1
‘ it does n’t always work out like that when you transition from club to internationals , so clearly they ’ve done a good job in how they prepared their group last week and they ’ll be pleased with the result			2
‘ they showed a desire to play and are obviously feeling pretty good about that , so i guess what it has done is raised the bar a little bit with us about the challenges which will come on saturday			0
’ while @entity20 is acutely aware of the skills at his disposal @entity135 , one of his most astute and versatile backs , is still to catch up on @entity6 ’s game against the @entity138			0
still , the @entity140 utility man is excited about the @entity141 ’ style of rugby			0
‘ i think it ’s good that they ’re wanting to play expansively , and move the ball when they can , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s the good thing about rugby , i think , that that kind of play gets rewarded , so it ’s good to see that @entity6 have embraced that kind of rugby and i ’m sure it will make for good entertainment on saturday			0
‘ there are some quality players throughout their back line			0
[ @entity159 ] @entity158 the full - back is a very dangerous runner and the likes of [ @entity164 ] @entity163 and their back three are pretty dangerous , so they ’re not unknown at all			1
the guys have a good amount of respect for this @entity6 team and we know we ’ll have to be on our game this weekend			0
’ pushed on whether complacency might creep in when facing a team they have never lost to , @entity135 added : ‘ we ’re not complacent at all - we have a big challenge ahead of us			2
‘ we ’ve looked at the game against @entity4 and how we can improve and i ’m sure as we go through the week we ’ll have a good look at @entity6			0
but we know that they are a team that likes to play expansive rugby ; they ’re a dangerous team			0
‘ they are definitely a team that is improving on the international stage … and if they ’re going to get better it ’s through playing the kind of rugby that they are			0
they ’ve got a good coach and so , yes , we ’ve got to prepare really well because it ’s going to be a big battle come saturday			0
