by @entity0 published : 12:32 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 12:32 est , 8 january 2013 the distraught parents of a child who died in hospital just eight hours after she was born have called for changes after claiming staff failed to respond to warning signs			1
@entity7 and @entity9 - @entity8 are not pursuing compensation , but they want @entity11 , @entity12 , to apologise and admit liability over the death over their daughter @entity15			1
they want to ensure staff are properly trained to assess when a heart monitor flags up an issue so that no more parents have to suffer the agony of losing a child like they did			1
@entity7 and @entity9 - @entity8 and their 21 - month old daughter @entity23 : they want @entity11 to apologise and admit liability over the death over their daughter @entity15 , who died at just eight hours old complications during labour meant @entity15 was n’t breathing when she was born and had inhaled meconium - a baby ’s first stool passed when in distress in the womb			1
she also had a second infection from the placenta and had to be revived , but she died when she was just eight hours old			2
mr and mrs @entity8 claim warning signs of their baby 's distress were n’t taken seriously by staff , and that they waited so long for an emergency caesarean that @entity15 instead had to be delivered using forceps			1
' the cord was around her neck and she had inhaled meconium so it was pouring from her nose and mouth , ' said mrs @entity8 , 28			2
' if the caesarean section had been done at 3am when we signed the papers , or earlier if they ’d listened to our concerns about the warning bleeps on the monitor , my daughter would have stood more of a chance to fight the infections			2
' @entity15 lies in intensive care at @entity11 : complications during labour meant @entity15 wasn ¿ t breathing when she was born and had inhaled meconium - a baby ¿ s first stool passed when in distress in the womb mr @entity68 , 29 , a teacher at @entity69 , @entity70 - on - @entity12 , said : ' the monitor was flashing up concerns , but we were told there might be something wrong with the machine and they reset it			1
' they should ’ve taken it more seriously			2
' though the waters broke at 8pm and there was no sign of meconium , the monitors and also @entity83 ’s high temperature were indications of a problem			1
' looking forward : mr and mrs @entity8 are not looking for compensation but they want to make sure staff are properly trained to potential problems mrs @entity8 was told her fever was a side effect of the epidural , but she had no problem with her first child , @entity23 , who is now 21 months			1
her husband added : ' there must be a point where they have to take all these problems seriously			1
' an emergency caesarean was decided at 3am , but another woman considered more urgent was admitted to theatre first			2
the parents , from @entity106 , were told a second theatre could be opened if there was no more progress in an hour , but nothing happened until 6am when mrs @entity8 needed to push			1
@entity111 worked for half an hour to get @entity15 breathing and she was rushed to the special care baby unit			2
however doctors warned the couple their child may be brain dead or severely brain damaged			0
mr and mrs @entity8 made the heartbreaking decision to turn off @entity15 ’s life support at 3.15pm on september 30 last year			0
she weighed a healthy 7lbs 12oz			0
@entity15 should ’ve survived if things were taken seriously and they had acted sooner , ' said mr @entity68			0
mrs @entity8 added : ' it was so unexpected			0
she was a healthy baby			0
' this @entity124 was horrible but we had to make it special for @entity23			0
i went to a cold grave to see my baby girl when it should ’ve been her first @entity124			0
' i feel so sad for @entity23 to never know her sister			0
' pupils where mr @entity68 teaches have been busy fundraising for @entity136 in memory of his daughter			0
@entity139 have held two charity weeks raising money for the hospital where @entity15 was due to be transferred to for specialist treatment , but sadly never made it			0
mr @entity68 was also treated there as a four - year - old boy for a non-malignant tumour behind his eye			0
students have raised about £ 3,000 from a charity seafront walk and other events held in school and an online page has £ 1,360 donations			0
to make a donation visit @entity155 mr and mrs @entity8 have called for the hospital to apologise and admit liability , but they are not pursuing a compensation claim			1
the couple want to ensure changes are made so that staff are properly trained to assess when potential problems appear on heart monitor monitors , so no other parent has to go through the the grief they have suffered			1
they also called for high risk pregnancies to be scanned towards the end of a birth to show difficulties with the placenta , and the cord and blood tests to be done to check for infection levels			0
an inquest is yet to be held into @entity15 ’s death			1
@entity11 says it has supported the family with meetings with clinicians and the head of midwifery and set up counselling for them			1
@entity186 , director of nursing , said : ' we fully understand the distress the loss of a baby brings and once again offer our sincerest condolences to @entity68 and mrs @entity8 in their grief following the death of @entity15			2
' the family have met with our clinical teams and our head of midwifery and we will continue to support and advise them during this very difficult pre-inquest period			0
