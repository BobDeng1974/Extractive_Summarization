his medals tell the story of extra-ordinary acts of gallantry and a flying career so distinguished it helped to change the course of the @entity8			2
yesterday former @entity10 pilot @entity9 remained a hero to the last – by putting them up for sale in honour of his fallen comrades			2
the 95 - year - old @entity17 squadron leader , now the only surviving pilot of the legendary raid , is to auction the medals to help pay for the upkeep of @entity22 ’s recently built memorial to the 55,573 airmen killed in the war			1
yesterday he revealed he was inspired to make the selfless gesture after being moved by a visit to the @entity28 in @entity29			2
the medals are expected to fetch around £ 50,000 when they are sold with his flying logs and other memorabilia this month , but @entity59 has pledged to donate the proceeds to the @entity61 , the welfare charity that maintains the memorial in @entity63			1
he said he wanted to do so ‘ out of comradeship ’ for the airmen who never came home			0
he added it was a ‘ travesty ’ that the ‘ magnificent memorial ’ – dedicated to @entity22 and @entity70 airmen and ground crew after a campaign led by the @entity73 and others – was not unveiled until 2012 , more than 67 years after the war ended			1
@entity59 is described as ‘ one of the great heroes ’ of @entity27 , the elite air crew responsible for some of the most strategically critical bombing successes of the war			0
remembered : the @entity28 is dedicated to the 55,573 airmen and ground staff killed during the @entity8			2
it costs £ 50,000 a year to maintain , and @entity9 wants to help pay for it service : @entity9 leaning out of the cockpit of his @entity87 , which he flew on the @entity27 raid			1

but permanent memorial for @entity108 was n't built for 67 years due to the controversy of thousands of @entity42 civilians who died during the bombings of its cities			1
in 2010 @entity42 politicians called for plans for the memorial to be abandoned out of respect for the civilian casualties			1
backed by @entity122 , their country 's biggest daily newspaper , they said the idea was offensive to the 25,000 victims of the raid on @entity127 in 1945			0
@entity129 singer @entity128 , a key supporter , said at the time : ' anyone speaking against it should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves			0
' the whole world , including @entity42 , is free today because of @entity108 's sacrifice			2
' but 67 years after the war ended the £ 3.5million @entity17 memorial was created at the @entity139 entrance to @entity63 in @entity29			1
built from @entity141 , it is open to the sky with the entrance made from sections of a @entity146 bomber shot down during the war			0
a sculpture inside marks the loss of the plane 's seven crew			2
foremost among them was the 1943 precision raid that destroyed dams in @entity42 ’s industrial heartland , crippling armament factories along the @entity158 valley			1
the ‘ bouncing bomb ’ attack was immortalized 12 years later in the film @entity162 , starring @entity163			0
@entity9 , then a flight lieutenant , was piloting one of the @entity87 bombers to the dams when the aircraft was hit by flak , smashing a gaping hole into the rear fuselage , damaging equipment vital to sighting the target and wiping out all communications			1
the crew realised they would be ‘ a menace ’ to their fellow airmen without radio contact , and could jeopardise the entire mission by carrying on			0
against difficult odds , @entity9 saved the lives of his crew by flying the plane home safely , still carrying its specially designed mine			1
the raid claimed the lives of 53 of the 133 crew on the mission , among them eight commanding officers			2
wing commander @entity190 , who led the mission and received the @entity191 , said he was ‘ a most charming fellow – one of those types who can always be relied upon to do the right thing at the right moment ’			0
@entity9 , promoted afterwards to squadron leader , went on to lead successful raids on @entity42 arms factories , rocket sites and u-boat pens all over @entity52			1
after the war he returned to his native @entity37 , where his @entity203 - born father had emigrated in 1903 to become a shepherd and start a family			0
his @entity37 medals for post-war service in regional politics are being sold with his other medals and campaign stars at the auction in @entity29 on march 25			0
@entity212 , of auctioneers @entity213 , described him as ‘ a remarkable man whose spirit of adventure never left him ’			0
@entity219 , @entity61 director of strategy and fundraising , said : ‘ @entity9 will consider it a small sacrifice compared to the sacrifice made by thousands of comrades in the war			0
’ old friends : @entity9 ( left ) shares a joke with wing commander @entity228 , who took over as @entity27 commander , at a 1986 reunion in @entity37			0

@entity9 , 95 , flew @entity87 on raid on dams using bouncing bombs
he hopes to raise £ 50,000 for upkeep of the central @entity29 @entity17 memorial
built to remember 55,573 aircrew and *groundstaff* who died in @entity8
not finished until 2013 after row with @entity42 over respect for their dead
@entity251 's @entity87 bomber was hit by @entity253 fire over @entity90 on raid
but he flew plane back to @entity22 with a gaping hole , saving lives of his crew
