as the clock ran down in a 2 - 1 win for @entity2 at @entity12 , @entity13 ’s nasty tackle provoked an irate response from @entity1 who went for his opponent and deliberately clashed heads			1

@entity3 was charged with a breach of disciplinary rule 200 , exhibiting ‘ serious foul play by stamping or attempting to stamp on an opposing player , namely @entity1 ’			0
@entity1 , for his retaliation , was charged with breaching the same disciplinary rule 200 by exhibiting ‘ violent conduct by headbutting or attempting to head - butt an opposing player , namely @entity3 ’			2
poor timing : @entity3 clipped @entity1 during a tackle at @entity12 demolition derby : @entity1 and @entity48 ( @entity49 ) had to be separated at full time @entity2 quickly announced that @entity1 would not be contesting the ban , with a spokesman saying : ‘ @entity2 has today received a notice of complaint from the @entity27 against @entity1 for an incident that took place in sunday ’s derby win over @entity4			1
the club has accepted the offer of a two - game ban and will not be appealing			0
