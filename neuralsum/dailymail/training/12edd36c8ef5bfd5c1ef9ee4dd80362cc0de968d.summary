by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 descended into chaos as manager @entity3 and owner @entity4 argued about the £ 7million sale of @entity6 and @entity7 to @entity8			1
a furious @entity3 claimed that the deal involving two of @entity1 ’s best players was agreed behind his back , but @entity4 responded by insisting that the new boss was consulted and that the transfers were necessary for the club to meet financial fair play rules			1
in a twist likely to cause further disharmony between the pair , last night @entity20 moved in for forwards @entity21 and @entity23			0
@entity1 , in turn , have approached @entity25 for their 24 - year - old winger @entity26			2
@entity38 , 20 , and goalkeeper @entity7 , 23 , will be loaned back to @entity1 this season with their wages being picked up by @entity8 — and while @entity3 is grateful for that , he believes their value in the market would have been substantially higher next season			1
@entity6 , who was the subject of a £ 5m bid from @entity47 in 2011 , signed a four - and - a - half - year contract in march , while highly - rated @entity7 had three years left on his deal			1
@entity3 takes charge of his first competitive match since returning to @entity1 when @entity52 visit @entity53 on saturday but before then will seek talks with @entity55 , who was forced to deny accusations that he would meddle in team affairs when @entity3 was unveiled back in april			1
the pair were at loggerheads yesterday as each made public his own version of events			0
@entity3 said : ‘ i am not prepared to fluff things when it comes to what was said and done behind the scenes			1
two players were sold against my will			2
‘ if it was my money , the boys would not have been sold			2
when it is out of my hands , there is not a lot i can do about it			0
all i can do is make a recommendation to people			0
i thought i could push their value up and that they would be worth more in the long run			0
‘ the first i heard about things was when @entity6 told me that he had a medical at @entity8			1
new boss : @entity3 said he was extremely disappointed with the decision ‘ i would like to think that , somewhere down the line , they would back my knowledge , with respect of the amount of time i have been in the game			1
‘ the chairman @entity92 has been in @entity93 the whole of this summer so i ’ve not had a conversation with him regarding the players			0
but i did with other financial people at the club			0
‘ they asked my opinion about what i thought of the offer and i said do n’t do the deal — but the deal was done			2
‘ i do n’t know the financial constraints the club are working under			0
i plan to find that out , very soon			0
then perhaps i can understand this decision			0
’ making his mark : @entity4 purchased the @entity110 club back in 2012 in a statement released on the club website , @entity55 countered : ‘ the manager and i openly discussed the proposed sale of @entity7 and @entity6 and he was aware of the negotiations throughout			1
the business side of football is changing and the requirement to increase revenue means , unfortunately , difficult decisions have to be made			0
‘ should the pair ’s proposed move to @entity8 be completed as expected , the transfer fees will significantly help us meet the stringent @entity126 criteria , all the while allowing us to retain two high - quality players for the 2014 - 15 season , paying nothing towards their wages			1
‘ sadly for me , there is no room for sentimentality in the running of a football club and it is up to me to start making some tough decisions to preserve the long - term sustainability of @entity1			2
‘ but while balancing the books is a hugely significant part of my role , it remains my job to ensure the manager has the best possible squad to work with as we pursue a place in the @entity148 added on @entity149 shortly afterwards : ‘ @entity3 and i work together as a team , and not work behind each other ’s backs to bring the best out of this club			2

@entity4 says @entity3 was involved in negotiations throughout

@entity3 said he was extremely disappointed as he wanted to keep duo
