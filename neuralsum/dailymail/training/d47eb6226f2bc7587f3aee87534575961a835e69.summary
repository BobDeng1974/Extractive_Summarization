@entity10 , 50 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , is charged with murdering former @entity14 sergeant @entity13 , 49 , in 2008			1
however she claims he was an abusive , reckless and terrifying man			0

but she has pleaded not guilty , claimed self - defence and drawn the attention of domestic violence activists			1
tears : @entity10 , 50 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , is charged with murdering former @entity14 sergeant @entity13 , 49 , and she fell apart on the witness stand during the trial on wednesday ( file picture ) ‘ i 'm afraid i 'm going to get sick , ’ @entity13 said in court on wednesday , barely able to glance at the .38 - calibre revolver that lay on the witness stand next to her			1
‘ i do n't want to do it			0
’ @entity13 was hammered with questions on her husband 's life insurance policies and the moments leading to the shooting by @entity38 , prosecuting , during the third day of cross-examination			1
@entity13 was often contradictory and claimed to not remember signing cheques her two children had written to her - proceeds from their father 's life insurance policies			1
she said that they helped her pay the bills , but that she did not specifically benefit from the money			0
her two children , @entity52 , 25 , and @entity13 , 21 , have both said that their father abused them and their mother , and that they lived in fear of him			1
together : @entity13 , right , claimed her husband @entity13 , left , was an abusive , reckless and terrifying man they are expected to testify at the trial , and both wept with their mother as she composed herself in a courtroom pew after she was asked to hold the revolver			1
law in @entity12 does allow people to defend themselves - but only to a certain extent			1
it is legal under state self - defence laws to kill a person if that is required to remove yourself or someone else from danger to your life or lives			2
however the law is only to provide protection - so @entity12 are not allowed to assault beyond removing the threat someone poses			1
it could therefore be argued that you are only allowed to shoot someone to the extent where a dangerous situation is diffused			0
@entity87 and her mother both wore purple to show support for victims of domestic violence			1
many other women in the courtroom were also seen wearing the colour			0
prosecutors tried to show on the shooting day in february 2008 @entity13 was not fearful for her life			1
she proofed her son 's school paper , drank coffee and made travel arrangements for a trip to @entity105			0
@entity13 claimed she did n't want to go with her husband on vacation but was pretending to out of fear because he had said he would kill her if she did n't come			1
the fight prompted the fatal argument			0
he dragged her out of bed the morning of the shooting and threw her out of the house in her pyjamas , saying she could n't come back until she agreed to go with him , she told the court			2
allegations : @entity13 shot her husband 11 times using two handguns that he kept loaded , prosecutors say but she stood outside nearly an hour in the winter cold before agreeing to come			1
the retired officer kept loaded his loaded service weapon , a @entity127 handgun , and an off - duty gun , the revolver			1
often he kept one holstered to his side - and the other on his ankle			2
' living with the man i lived with , i tried to survive the best i could ' @entity10 ‘ living with the man i lived with , i tried to survive the best i could , ’ she testified			1
assistant district attorney ms @entity38 asked repeatedly whether @entity13 ever called 911 or a domestic violence hotline in the hours leading to the shooting			1
the answer was always no. after her husband got into the shower , she left to go to a friend 's house , where she was frantic			2
‘ i did n't know what to do , ’ she said			0
she went back home to get the $ 1,700 in cash she had stashed in her drawer and said she planned to tell her husband she was going to get dog food but never come back			2
evidence : @entity13 is pictured in a grey jacket and white blouse at the @entity150 on tuesday she saw the revolver in the bedroom , took it and walked to the hall			2
her husband was in the bathroom , recently showered , the glock by his side on the vanity table			0
that 's when it happened			0
' i do n't know what i was thinking then - i was so scared			0
i thought he 'd come after me and kill me			0
i could see his face , and his eyes , and his hand and the gun			0
i knew he was going to kill me ' @entity10 during testimony , @entity13 was barely understandable through tears - her head down , face in her hands , shielding her eyes from ms @entity38 , as she said he pointed the gun at her and she fired			1
‘ i do n't know what i was thinking then - i was so scared , ’ she said			0
‘ i thought he 'd come after me and kill me			0
’ but prosecutors sought to suggest he did not point the gun at her , and noted he never fired			0
‘ i could see his face , and his eyes , and his hand and the gun , ’ she said , her voice rising with every word			0
‘ i knew he was going to kill me			0
’ but @entity13 would not answer specific questions , such as where she was standing when the shooting happened and how she ended up with both guns			2
team : @entity13 , centre , is pictured with her daughter @entity52 , and her defence lawyer @entity190 she also refused to answer whether she later told her mother that her husband had been laughing at her with the gun , and that was why she shot him			1
‘ was he naked ? ’ ms @entity38 asked			0
‘ i do n't know , ’ @entity13 wept			2
‘ was he shaving ? ’ she asked			0
‘ i do n't know , ’ @entity13 replied , later adding that she did n’t know what he was wearing either			2
on several occasions , ms @entity38 asked @entity13 to show the jury how she held the gun at her husband , and each time she said she was physically unable to do it			1
the revolver sat on the witness stand , and @entity13 cowered from it			1
‘ does this have to be there ? ’ she asked			0
‘ it 's part of evidence , ’ answered acting @entity206 @entity205			0
