talk about making an entrance			2
the teams were out for the second half , the spectators were seated and the referees were ready to get going but there was one problem : two players were missing			2
so @entity9 waited patiently , expectantly and then they got what they wanted : emerging from the tunnel , wearing no 7 and no 9 , came @entity13 and @entity14 , two of this stadium ’s most revered former sons			2
this was an afternoon for nostalgia , a chance for @entity20 to embrace the past and pay homage to some returning heroes and they grabbed their chance when @entity13 and @entity14 took to the field for this all - star charity match , between teams captained by @entity28 and @entity29			1
@entity28 ( third left ) is congratulated by former @entity31 strikers @entity14 ( second left ) and @entity13 ( third right ) at @entity9 @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity28 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 pose for a photograph after the game @entity40 , who has n't shown his best form since arriving at @entity31 for £ 16million in the summer , scored a brilliant goal from long range @entity44 @entity44 added a second goal to put @entity29 's side 2 - 0 up , latching on to a pass and rounding goalkeeper @entity48 to score @entity28 converted a penalty to bring his team back into the game on a sunny afternoon at @entity9 in the all - star charity game a second penalty of the afternoon followed for @entity28 in the second half and he duly converted that one too to level the scores @entity28 's xi : @entity48 ( @entity57 78 mins ) , @entity58 , a @entity28 ( @entity59 46 ) , @entity60 ( @entity61 46 ) , @entity62 ( @entity63 46 ) , @entity28 ( @entity64 81 ) , @entity34 ( @entity64 32 ) ( @entity65 46 ) , @entity66 ( @entity67 46 ) , @entity68 , @entity69 ( @entity14 46 ) , @entity70 ( @entity13 46 )			1
manager : @entity72 @entity29 's xi : @entity36 ( @entity74 61 ) , @entity75 ( @entity76 32 ) , @entity29 , @entity77 , @entity37 ( @entity78 46 ) , @entity79 ( @entity80 72 ) , @entity81 ( @entity82 46 ) , @entity83 ( @entity84 46 ) , @entity85 ( @entity86 46 ) , @entity44 ( @entity33 46 ) , @entity40 ( @entity87 46 )			1
manager : @entity89 attendance : 44,903 @entity91 , who was sold to @entity92 for £ 50million two days after @entity13 joined @entity31 in january 2011 , had admitted to being unsure what kind of reception he would receive , given the circumstances in which he had left			1
there was also the fact that his last touch on this ground came on april 27 last year , when he slipped the ball past the stranded @entity104 to @entity105			2
the upshot , of course , was the @entity109 scoring and @entity92 blowing a hole in @entity31 ’s title challenge			1
he need not have worried			0
his name was cheered before the game , he was hailed on to the pitch and his was the first name sung in the second half of a ‘ contest ’ that should see local charities benefit to the tune of more than £ 1m			2
it was n’t just about @entity91 , though			0
this was an opportunity for many big names from @entity31 ’s past to say proper goodbyes , for men like @entity34 , @entity36 , @entity13 , @entity62 and the non-playing @entity35 to bring closure to certain chapters in their respective careers			2
@entity34 , for one , had waited six years for this			0
he could have had a reunion last october with @entity132 in the @entity133 but he had been sold to @entity134 two months before			0
@entity34 found out about the emotional draw moments after completing his medical in @entity137			0
he , clearly , enjoyed the 30 minutes he was on the pitch , as did everyone else involved in the game , which came from an idea @entity28 had to say thank you to @entity31 as a city before he starts his new venture in @entity146			1
@entity44 puts an arm around @entity148 midfielder @entity66 as stars from across @entity28 and @entity29 's careers came out to play @entity83 plays a pass with his left foot as @entity92 captain @entity60 and @entity31 captain @entity28 , playing on the same team , watch on @entity40 opened the scoring at @entity9 after just eight minutes , getting ahead of opposition captain @entity28 to slam in a long - range shot @entity29 and his @entity157 colleague @entity70 share a laugh and a high five after the former defender thwarts his friend 's chance @entity44 doubled the lead after deceiving goalkeeper @entity48 with a step - over and then coolly finishing into the empty net at the @entity168 end @entity92 's @entity170 centre forward has scored 11 goals against @entity31 during his long career so it was no surprise to see him score at @entity9 take @entity60 and @entity44			1
for so long these two @entity92 stalwarts have been regarded as the enemy but both were given generous receptions for helping the cause , particularly @entity44 when he scored the second goal of the game for @entity29 ’s team on 31 minutes			1
the first had been scored by @entity40 and a cracker it was too , the @entity184 whipping a 25 - yard drive that fizzed into the corner of @entity168 net on nine minutes			1
he was n’t put under great pressure but the finish still smacked of class			0
at one stage it looked as if @entity29 ’s side , managed by @entity89 , would saunter to victory but @entity28 has made comebacks a fixture of his @entity31 career and he ensured this match did not end in defeat			1
he scored two penalties , one in the 36th minute after @entity77 had adjudged to trip @entity69 and another just after the hour when @entity29 quite clearly barged @entity13 over			1
some would say the @entity202 columnist was lucky not to make it into @entity205 ’s book			0
the icing on the cake would have been a goal for either @entity14 or @entity13 but , despite the best efforts of the @entity211 in particular , it never arrived			2
a draw was an appropriate end to a memorable day			0
the smiles on the faces as a lap of honour was completed confirmed that			0
@entity40 and @entity44 share an embrace after their goals gave @entity223 the lead from early on in the charity game @entity134 midfielder @entity34 leaves the field at @entity9 to a warm ovation and an embrace with @entity31 manager @entity72 @entity69 was brought down by @entity77 inside the @entity230 penalty area to give @entity28 the chance to pull a goal back @entity36 does his best to put his old team - mate off ahead of his attempt from the spot , but the jibes were all good - natured between the pair @entity28 was obviously not phased by @entity36 's antics , and he sent the @entity240 keeper the wrong way from the spot , shooting to his left two former @entity31 strikers entered the field as half - time substitutes , with @entity13 and @entity14 both returning to @entity9 @entity14 holds off the challenge of current @entity31 midfielder @entity79 as he got back into the experience of playing on @entity249 @entity28 tucks away his second penalty of the afternoon to level the scores for his team after they came from two goals behind afterwards @entity28 told @entity255 : ' it has been absolute brilliant , more than anything the charities have done well with a full house			1
' the hairs on my neck were standing up			0
there were times i did n't know who to pass to			0
people have gone out of their way to come here			0
' it has been absolutely magical			0
every player who was asked to come here did , whether they had to drive for an hour or get three flights			0
' @entity13 plants a kiss on the head of his former captain after he converted the penalty won by the @entity211 to make it 2 - 2 at @entity9 @entity65 tries to get the ball away from @entity79 in midfield as the two teams enjoyed a well - fought but fair game on sunday afternoon @entity29 and @entity36 , who spent years together at @entity9 , enjoy a moment out on the pitch as they renewed their defensive link - up @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity28 , @entity35 and @entity37 ( left to right ) gather for a photo together after the full - time whistle the famous @entity9 scoreboard shows the names of two of the stadium 's most famous players after their two teams played out a 2 - 2 draw @entity40 posted this photo after the game captioned : ' legends			1
always nice to see you guys , @ didierdrogba you are welcome for my pass @entity44 , @entity14 and @entity60 pose together as they caught up on their days at @entity92 together in the @entity9 dressing rooms after the game			1
