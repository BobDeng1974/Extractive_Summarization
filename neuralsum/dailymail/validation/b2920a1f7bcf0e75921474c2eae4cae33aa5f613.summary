@entity0 scored his 30th league goal of the season but could n’t prevent @entity3 dropping two points in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity6			1
he is now only one goal from his tally for last season with 12 games left and has become the first striker to score 30 goals a season for the fifth consecutive campaign in one of @entity17 ’s top leagues but he left the pitch annoyed at @entity3 ’s failure to pull away from @entity20 at the top of @entity22			2
they are now just two points clear of their rivals with a trip to the @entity27 later this month still to come			0
@entity0 celebrates with @entity28 and @entity29 after putting @entity3 1 - 0 up from the penalty spot @entity0 , who won the penalty himself , looked to have put the hosts in control when he sent @entity34 the wrong way from the spot @entity37 celebrates after scoring the equaliser that @entity6 's quality and endeavour deserved , and his side held on for a point @entity43 makes a stunning goal - line block with his head , diving behind @entity3 keeper @entity47 to keep the score at 0 - 0 @entity3 : @entity47 , @entity43 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity28 , @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity54 72 mins ) , @entity55 ( @entity56 78 ) , @entity29 * ( @entity57 81 ) , @entity0 subs not used : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62			1

the @entity90 loanee was bundled over by @entity49 in one of @entity6 ’s first attacks and from the free - kick the visitors won a corner which led to their first clear cut chance			0
it fell to @entity37 but with only @entity47 to beat he shot straight at @entity99 keeper			2
when the rebound ran to @entity72 his effort was dived - headed to safety by @entity43			0
the keeper congratulated the full - back – both had saved certain goals			0
@entity28 was seeing plenty of the ball down the @entity3 right although he was at times handicapped by his preference for crossing with his left			1
he should have been awarded a penalty when @entity68 grabbed his arm at a corner and stopped him taking off to connect with @entity52 ’ kick			0
it was a spot - kick but the referee waved away the @entity120 ’s appeal			0
from another @entity52 corner on the half hour @entity28 this time jumped unimpeded and headed just wide			1
@entity50 came even closer shaving the post from another corner kick as @entity3 pushed for the opening goal			0
as the half went on @entity3 took more and more risks with @entity51 flying forward and throwing himself at an @entity55 pass but failing to connect effectively			2
@entity28 then hit the top of @entity34 ’s bar with a cross-shot from the right and @entity0 blasted a free - kick over from 35 - yards			1
@entity0 fights for the ball with @entity71 as @entity3 found @entity6 difficult to break down at the @entity135 on sunday night @entity29 gets up above @entity6 defensive pair @entity136 and @entity66 but he could n't direct his header past @entity34 ronaldo apologies to @entity51 after failing to play the @entity141 in when well - placed during a frustrating night for the @entity143 champions @entity6 had defended well and for the first time in the league since august @entity3 went down the tunnel at half - time with the score at 0 - 0			1
the @entity135 crowd had not helped with the usual nervous whistles for @entity28 when one of his passes went astray			1
he had shown more than most for the home side and in the second half his pass to @entity0 brought about the opening goal			2
as the ball was played in @entity158 tried to take the @entity159 for a dance grabbing him around the waist and and spinning him around			0
the referee pointed to the spot and @entity0 stepped up to score goal number 30 in the league this season			0
he could have got his second moments later from another @entity28 assist but this time @entity34 blocked the effort and took an accidental @entity0 knee to his face in the process			1
@entity0 then returned the favour to @entity28 but the he pulled his shot high and wide			1
@entity3 now looked in complete control having broken @entity6 ’s dogged resistance but they were in for a shock			0
with a sweeping eight - pass move from one end of the pitch to the other @entity6 went from keeper @entity34 to striker @entity37 who leveled the scores			0
he played a one - two on the edge of the @entity3 area with substitute @entity185 and shot past @entity47 to silence the @entity135			1
@entity186 keeps a close eye on the @entity188 , who was not at his best against the @entity190 ronaldo probes at the @entity6 defence , but he and his expensively assembled team - mates struggled to find a way through @entity28 failed to have much of an impact , with the exception of one cross which looped up onto the crossbar late in the first half @entity52 expresses his frustration as @entity3 missed the chance to extend their lead over @entity20 to four points @entity3 were almost back in front from their next attack but when @entity0 ran on to @entity55 ’s pass and shot goalwards @entity34 blocked the effort			1
@entity28 then crossed from the right and @entity0 rose highest in the area but against @entity210 made the save brilliantly tipping the ball over his bar			1
@entity214 risked the wrath of the @entity135 by taking off fans favourite @entity55 to put on @entity217 and he even threw on @entity57 for @entity29 but @entity57 failed to make a difference going down dramatically in the area but not convincing the referee to point to the spot			2
@entity221 fell over when clean through with only @entity47 to beat and he then saw the @entity99 keeper brilliantly turn away his diving header			0
for @entity54 shot wide with the goal gaping after @entity34 dropped the ball but a point was the very least @entity6 deserved			0
@entity227 goes to ground in an attempt to stop @entity28 getting past him , but the @entity120 got the better of the defender @entity28 gets up above three defenders , but for all their chances real were unable to find a crucial winning goal			0

@entity28 hits the cross bar as @entity3 fail to break their *opponents* down in difficult first half
