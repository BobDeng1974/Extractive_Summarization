a @entity1 do - gooder whose weapon of choice is the short sell has waged war on companies engaged in fraud as the ' @entity8 ' of the financial markets			1
styling himself after the @entity11 , @entity12 , a 32 - year - old investor linked to the firm @entity13 , has gone up against several corporations and won			1
@entity13 's strategy is to perform ' due diligence - based , special situation investing , ' which in practice means short selling targeted companies then publicizing the fraud			1
activist : taking his inspiration from @entity8 , @entity12 , a 32 - year - old investor linked to the firm @entity13 , has gone up against several corporations and won in april , @entity25 went after @entity26 , a @entity28 firm , alleging that ' 42 % -80 % of @entity26 's profits are suspect ' in a report unceremoniously tweeted one morning			1
' @entity26 was little more than a country club until 2008/2009 , ' the report continues , but began reporting ' google-esque ' profit margins two years later			0
after the report was published , the outsourcing and consulting corporation 's stock price tumbled 39 percent in a single day according to @entity38			0
@entity26 's chief exec later resigned , along with the company 's finance director and a third employee , after several other missteps			1
@entity12 has been hesitant to reveal too much of his identity , not wanting to open himself up to the animosity that short selling can attract			2
instead of @entity48 , @entity12 hides out in his home on @entity50 , the @entity47 reports			2
apart from his @entity52 education and work as a hedge - fund analyst , little is known about his life			0
crusader : @entity12 's stance is that authorities and regulators often lack the resources to go after bad actors , leaving the work up to activist investors like @entity13 on july 1 , @entity25 struck again , alleging that @entity66 telecom @entity64 could legitimately claim only around 10 percent of the sales they reported on the books			1
stock fell 46 percent and a week later , the firm was filing for insolvency , its chief executive officer resigning and admitting the last four years of financial results were fraudulent			1
' if you pay close attention to @entity8 , he always worked within the spirit and the letter of the law , ' @entity12 told @entity38 by phone ( the media shy investor denied the @entity47 an interview )			1
' he ’s not a vigilante			0
he realizes that the authorities have scarce resources and limited personnel			0
we are driven by the desire to show people that the world does n’t belong to seemingly untouchable wrong - doers			1
' @entity12 reportedly soured on the financial markets after a big bet in @entity94 went bust along with the mortgage lender in 2008			2
@entity25 , which has also gone after tech stocks @entity97 and @entity99 , as well as @entity100 , has not disclosed how much it has made off its pursuit of deceitful corporations			2
the practice is similar to other small short sellers , such as @entity106 's @entity105 , which targets ' inflated ' @entity108 corporations			0
@entity106 reportedly visited one targeted company , @entity112 , back in 2012 , disguised in street clothes and a baseball cap and claiming to be a hedge fund investor , the @entity110 reports			0
@entity106 's publicised pursuit of the commodities and supply chain service helped knock 21 percent off the share price			0
online , @entity12 alternates between discussing weaknesses in the financial markets and tweeting martin luther king , @entity125 , and @entity127 quotes			0
' it seems that if one truly cares about justice , one must be equally concerned about plight of poor , oppressed , etc. , as the falsely accused , ' he recently opined from behind the veil of his @entity133			0
an earlier version of this article stated that @entity25 had ‘ brought down ’ outsourcing company @entity26			1
we are happy to clarify that while @entity25 research investigated its practices , @entity26 continues to operate			2
we apologise for any contrary suggestion .			0

@entity12 , 32 , and his firm @entity142 forced @entity66 @entity144 service @entity64 to admit to filing fraudulent financial records
@entity25 also attacked outsourcing company @entity26
the activist investor short sells stocks before publicizing *critical* reports
@entity12 compares himself to the @entity8 , saying he 's driven to show that the world does *n't* belong to ' untouchable wrong - doers '
