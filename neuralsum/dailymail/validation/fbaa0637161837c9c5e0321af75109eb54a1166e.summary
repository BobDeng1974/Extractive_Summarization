@entity0 stood up to hecklers at a performance in @entity3 on friday night			1
at one point during the show a man stood up and yelled ; ' 38 women spoke up and called you a rapist			1
38 women ! ' as fans of @entity0 screamed ' shut up ! ' at the man , he quieted the audience and spoke directly to the protester			1
' i am going to handle this the way i want it handled , ' he said			0
38 women ! ' ( protesters from outside his @entity27 show earlier this year above ) ' just remain calm , ' @entity0 told the audience according to the @entity30			1
' we are here to enjoy my gift			2
we are not here to argue			0
we will find them and ask them to leave			2
' a few minutes later , the man was located and escorted out of the 2,500 - seat @entity39 , which was notably empty			0
this as venues have stopped selling water during @entity0 's performances , afraid someone may throw it at him during his set			1
one attendee said he only got tickets after a friend 's wife refused to go following the recent allegations , and he was more there to see the hoopla surrounding the event than the actual show			2
this happened on the same day two more women ( above with @entity56 ) came forward to say they were drugged and raped by @entity0 outside the venue , over 30 protesters greeted guests as they went into the auditorium , along with two individuals who were there in support of @entity0			1
' i have been sexually assaulted , ' one of the supporters , @entity65 , told the @entity67 ' i know what it feels like			0
but the man has n't been charged with a crime , and the man has n't gone to court			0
the @entity74 says , " judge not , lest you be judged			0
" ' earlier that day , two more women , @entity77 and @entity78 , came forward to claim they were drugged and raped by @entity0 as teenagers			2
@entity0 has continued to maintain his innocence .			0

@entity0 's performance in @entity3 was filled with protesters and at least one heckler in the venue
during his show a man stood up and screamed ; ' 38 women spoke up and called you a rapist . 38 women ! '
fans of @entity0 told the man to ' shut up ! ' while @entity0 urged everyone to be quiet while ushers looked for the man to escort him out
' we are here to enjoy my gift . we are not here to argue . let those people speak . we will find them and ask them to leave , ' said @entity0
meanwhile , venues have stopped serving *beverages* during the shows for fear someone may throw a drink on @entity0
