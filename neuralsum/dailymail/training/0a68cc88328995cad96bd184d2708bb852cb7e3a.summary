it 's a modern - day equivalent of @entity1 – the 1970s hit tv comedy in which middle - class couple @entity3 and @entity5 set out to live self - sufficiently from the produce of their suburban garden			1
the co-operative of residents living on the @entity11 in @entity12 generate their own energy , grow their own food , rear their own animals and supply their own water			1
the difference is that in this 2014 version , the residents enjoy ‘ all mod cons ’ : dishwashers , fridges , freezers , wi - fi , broadband and satellite tv			1
green room : a four - bedroom eco-pad - and a stake in the unique community at the he @entity11 in @entity12 - is on sale for £ 500,000 the project , which comprises five eco-houses , was set up in the late 1990s by @entity34 and a group of friends interested in sustainability			1
now a rare opportunity to join this select community has arisen , because @entity34 is leaving to build a new eco-home from scratch and is selling his four - bedroom eco-pad – and his stake in the unique community – for £ 500,000			1
he is quick to point out that among the benefits , the buyer will no longer have to pay heating bills or water rates			1
‘ instead of utilising a central heating system , ’ he says , ‘ the houses act as a thermal store for radiant heat from the sun , so the conservatories at the front of the building , which are south - facing , heat the fabric of the building			1
’ @entity58 on the roofs helps to seal in the warmth			0
@entity62 neighbours : residents @entity64 and @entity65 with their five - year - old son @entity66 hot property : the solar panels on the roof of the @entity11 , left , and right , the property for sale ‘ when it comes to power , the houses utilise photovoltaic panels and wind turbines to provide electricity , ’ @entity34 says			1
he adds : ‘ across the whole year we ’re net producers of power			0
the houses actually produce more electricity than they consume			0
’ the homes are connected to the @entity83 , allowing the community to fall back on mains electricity if necessary			0
‘ we have a drinking - water system that takes rainwater from the conservatory roofs and treats it , ’ @entity34 adds			1
he says that the washing - water system , which produces a slightly lower quality of water , takes water from the land , treats it through sand filters and then feeds it back to the houses			1
@entity34 believes he saves about £ 1,500 a year on electricity bills and a further £ 300 a year on water bills			1
the co-operative is spread across ten acres			2
there are vegetable plots , a greenhouse , an orchard – with apples , pears and plums – and land for sheep , chickens and bees			0
a lake on the site provides fish			2
‘ the experience of living here – waking up in the morning and looking out on to a lake with water lilies and fish swimming in it – always raises the spirits , ’ @entity34 says			1
the residents , who meet every week to discuss how best to maintain their green existence , are expected to clock up a set number of hours working the land			2
‘ one of the differences between this place and an ordinary house is that you have more contact with your neighbours , ’ @entity34 adds			0
‘ the community works by virtue of co-operation			0
you have the opportunity to plan things together and achieve things that you would n’t normally do			0
’ @entity34 will be moving out together with his new partner			0
he says : ‘ my family has grown up and moved away so it ’s come to the time really to think about moving on			0
' the house is probably larger than i need now and that ’s not very sustainable			0
’ green living : the kitchen in the eco house of @entity146 at the @entity11 in @entity147 , @entity12 the houses are sold on a leasehold basis			1
the leases run for 999 years and all began in 1998			0
the ground rent is £ 30 per year			2
the leases grant rights to all the services required to run the houses – water , electricity , waste - water treatment – and ensure that the leaseholders maintain the land co-operatively between the five households			1
the eco-pads have become a magnet for middle - class professionals			2
an illustrator , a psychologist and an acupuncturist are just some of the people who have left behind conventional households for the eco-retreat			0
company director @entity64 and @entity170 advocate @entity65 swapped a cramped two - bedroom flat in @entity172 for a house in the community , where they live with their five - year - old son @entity66			1
they now combine working from home with commuting to @entity172 or @entity178			2
they have an electric car which they use to buy the commodities not supplied by the project			0
‘ before moving to @entity185 we lived just off @entity186 in a top - floor flat – pretty noisy but it was great being in the centre of things , ’ @entity65 says			2
‘ but we had been to visit here and learned that one of the houses was up for sale			0
we were very keen to move out of @entity172 , and thinking about starting a family			0
’ she explains how the community shares the workload : ‘ we divide up the way that we grow our food so each family will be responsible for a different thing ; so we grow the peas and the beans and we also grow peppers and chillies			1
i ’m particularly keen on making more use of our poly - tunnel so that we can grow food for a longer season through the year			1
’ @entity209 adds : ‘ a lot of people expect composting toilets because it ’s an eco-house but it ’s just a normal home			2
we live a normal life , we just reduce our energy bills significantly			0
‘ there are aspects of living in @entity172 that we miss , but i certainly prefer living here			0
