but the 50 - year - old teacher still carries the mental scars from 1978 when she was sexually assaulted three times in one night by @entity12			1
she was only 14 at the time and the events of 36 years ago had an immense impact on her life			0
her daughter @entity17 explained : ‘ it shows in the way she relates to people			2
' i see it in the way she lacks confidence in so many things , and how she questions herself			0
it ’s like she carries these injuries which do n’t ever go away			0
’ @entity6 , 50 , still carries the mental scars from 1978 when she was sexually assaulted three times in one night by @entity12 being on a train or a bus in close proximity to other passengers , miss @entity6 would shake uncontrollably and the smell of aftershave or sweat made her nauseous			1
miss @entity6 was staying at a motel on the outskirts of @entity40 with her parents and brother when the assaults took place			1
‘ i had never so much as held hands with a boy – @entity12 took advantage of my complete naivety and inexperience with men , ’ she recalls			1
‘ i can never forgive him for that			0
’ one evening @entity12 arrived in the dining room with @entity5 environmentalist @entity53			1
‘ the two of them were very loud , very boisterous , singing dirty ditties and moving about the room sort of showing off and drawing attention to themselves , ’ remembers miss @entity6			1
@entity12 was encouraged to join a nearby group for drinks and later serenaded miss @entity6 ’s mother and another woman with sexual innuendo			1
miss @entity6 was keen to interview mr @entity53 for a school conservation project and he invited her to his room for a chat			1
she said : ‘ leaving my parents in the restaurant i followed mr @entity53 and @entity12 followed both of us into the lift			1
as soon as we were in the lift , @entity12 began to touch me			1
‘ initially his behaviour was like childish teasing , he was poking me in the ribs , tickling me , he called me “ little miss spaghetti legs ”			2
she was only 14 at the time and the events of 36 years ago had an immense impact on her life ‘ he pinched my buttocks and seemed to think it was funny that i was embarrassed by this			0
‘ i felt very uncomfortable with the way he was touching me but it was difficult to object because it was projected as innocent , playful teasing			0
when we got out of the lift his behaviour became more intrusive			0
‘ @entity12 walked behind me and as he did , he pressed his stomach and groin into my back and put his arms over my shoulders in a kind of hug , except that his hands were cupped over my breasts			1
‘ he was making a pinching action with his fingers more or less tweaking my breasts in time to a sing - song nursery rhyme tune			2
‘ i remember he called me a “ little wriggly one ” and sang something like “ legs like spaghetti and breasts like ripe plums ” which rhymed with “ tiddle um pum pum ” – i now know this is a line from one of his songs			2
‘ this was incredibly humiliating for me			0
the behaviour of @entity12 was absolutely devastating			1
’ minutes later , @entity12 assaulted her again			1
miss @entity6 said : ‘ as i was walking along the corridor i realised i did n’t have a pen or paper , so i went back along the corridor and into my room			1
‘ i was in the motel room , putting an ink cartridge into my pen when @entity12 entered the room behind me			1
he asked me what i was doing and took the pen and cartridge from me			0
in doing so , he spilled ink all over my school rucksack			0

when i held my hands up , he took my wrists and raised my hands toward his neck and shoulders and started to try to make me hug him			0
‘ he was saying “ come on , how about you give an old bloke a hug , @entity146 deserves a cuddle does n’t he ? ”			0
‘ he was speaking in a coaxing voice and seemed to ignore that i was clearly uncomfortable with this			0
i was holding my hands like closed fists so that he could not imagine that i had any intention of hugging him and i was pulling away from him			0
‘ he released my wrists and moved his arms under mine , preventing me from lowering them and he reached around and grabbed my buttocks and lifted me up toward him and he crouched down in an awkward stance , bending his knees into a grotesque posture			0

she went on : ‘ i returned to the lift			2
there was no sign of @entity12			1
but as i was in the lift and the doors were closing he reappeared and put his arm or leg between the closing doors to make them re-open			0
‘ he made this all seem very dramatic , bouncing into the lift and bumping into the back wall and then in front of me			0
‘ as soon as the lift closed , he stood in front of me , put one arm around me as though to hug me , but grabbed my wrist and held me in an arm lock , which effectively forced my back to arch and pushed my chest toward him			0
‘ in the same action he put his other hand inside my shirt and put his hand over my breasts , commenting in a matter of fact voice that “ my breasts really were like lovely ripe plums ”			0
‘ this happened very quickly and his actions were very fluid and in retrospect , seemed rehearsed – as though he was very practised in this motion			0
‘ this attack lasted altogether maybe ten to twenty seconds			0
it was very sudden , forceful and entirely against my will			0
‘ his behaviour was not about sexual gratification , it was about disempowering women , humiliating them			2
it reflects his whole attitude to women – he is simply a vicious bully			2
