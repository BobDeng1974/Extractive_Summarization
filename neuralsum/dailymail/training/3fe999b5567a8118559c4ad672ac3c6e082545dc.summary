by @entity0 published : 17:25 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 17:37 est , 29 september 2013 @entity1 was buried beneath the waves by a cataclysm aeons ago			1
addicts of @entity6 ’ tv will know the cataclysm had a name : @entity9			1
the man from @entity1 was a sci - fi drama featuring @entity9 , future star of the @entity13 soap opera @entity14 , as the last survivor of that mythical submerged city			1
he had webbed feet and gills , and he could live off seaweed at the bottom of the ocean			2
action packed : @entity1 promises to be a romp through @entity25 fables the problem was , @entity9 ’s acting was so wooden that he floated			1
the man from @entity1 was washed up after one series			1
keen to avoid any confusion with this disastrous prototype , the producers of @entity31 ’s new family adventure serial , @entity1 , have changed everything			1
@entity1 is n’t an undersea kingdom , for a start — it ’s a hot and dusty walled city on a @entity25 island			1
the hero @entity39 does n’t have gills			2
in fact , he is half drowned when the story starts : half drowned and completely naked			2
just as the @entity46 ’s previous saturday evening serial , @entity47 , tended to have @entity48 and his knights shirtless , @entity1 star @entity44 is going to be spending a lot of time bare - chested			1
this is family entertainment , after all , and @entity53 needs to be entertained as much as anyone			1
@entity47 was a wild romp through @entity57 fables and legends , and @entity1 promises to treat @entity25 myths in the same cavalier fashion			1
great viewing : we had romance , sword fights , supernatural beasts , prophets , mad kings , daring princesses and lashings of humour within minutes , @entity39 was fighting off a two - headed dragon , dodging arrows fired by the city guards and being rescued by a mathematician and a demigod — @entity76 and @entity77			2
the show gets away with it because hardly anyone knows more than a few fragments of the original tales			2
in @entity85 times it was very different : the myths were treated as serious historical accounts			2
only 225 years ago , @entity89 ’s @entity88 dated @entity39 to @entity90 , placing the @entity91 four decades later			2
mind you , dr @entity89 calculated that the world had been created in exactly @entity94			0
even his dictionary , however , did n’t believe in @entity1 : ‘ its situation is unknown , ’ he said , ‘ and its existence is doubted			1
’ potential : their sketch show was promising , the question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out so the producers of this big - budget show are free to mix history , legend and wild imagination on a gigantic scale , and they take full advantage			1
we had romance , sword fights , supernatural beasts , prophets , mad kings , daring princesses and lashings of humour			0
@entity120 , best known to fantasy fans for his role in @entity123 as king @entity124 , played @entity77 with a @entity126 accent			0
@entity127 was the nerdy @entity76 , prone to panicking and shouting things like : ‘ they ’ve released the hunting lions ! ’ the pace faltered only when the seeress @entity132 was grimacing and rolling her eyes , serving up her @entity134 with thick slices of ham			0
she ’ll probably get better with practice			0
carry on veteran @entity139 saucily recalled , in his portrait , on @entity141 , that when he worked with @entity143 in the @entity144 , the great actor was secretly gay			0
@entity146 ’s male lover was ‘ @entity147 , one of the best actors you could get , ’ @entity139 confided			0
whoever could he mean ? @entity1 has brought high jinks and family fun back to saturdays			1
it promises to be unmissable , as @entity153 , who directed the first three episodes , explains			0
‘ even i do n’t know where the story is heading , ’ he told me			0
‘ the actors were running from one set to another , filming different sequences , even different episodes , and it all comes together in post-production like a massive jigsaw			0
‘ i could read the scripts and find out			0
i could demand to see the future episodes			0
but i chose not to … because i want to watch it fresh			0
i want to keep it special , to sit and watch it on a saturday with my kids			0
’ also making their debut this weekend were the stars of the @entity176 comedy festival , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 , in @entity180 , @entity181 ( sunday , @entity182 )			0
their sketch show was promising			1
it had seagulls mugging chip shops , @entity187 cypher - breakers trying to decode the female mind and a ventriloquist ’s doll that was planning to elope with another puppeteer			0
the question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out.and they should do something about that abysmal name — at least change it to the @entity198 .			1

@entity1 has brought high jinks and family fun back to saturdays
the @entity203 and @entity204 was promising , but they should change the abysmal name
