@entity1 host @entity0 has said he believes the @entity2 and the @entity3 are ' inherently flawed ' and that the @entity2 needs an amendment changing its stance on same - sex marriage			2
the bold statements come days after the @entity9 journalist divided @entity10 with his strict stance on gun laws following the @entity14 massacre , even sparking e-petitions to deport him			1
while interviewing pastor @entity16 on his @entity1 show , he said : ' both the @entity2 and the @entity3 were well intentioned but they are basically , inherently flawed			2
hence , the need to amend it			0
' @entity16 , who is against same - sex marriage replied : ' not a chance			0
what i believe is flawed is human opinion , because it constantly changes			0
' my point to you about gay rights for example - it 's time for an amendment to the @entity2			0
you should compile a new bible			0
' with @entity16 responding that he believes that the @entity2 reveals the truth - and the truth is never outdated - @entity0 quipped : ' we â€™re going to agree to disagree on that			0
' his remarks sparked anger among conservatives , including @entity48 , the executive director of @entity49 at @entity50			0
' it 's remarkable to watch secular liberals like @entity0 assume unto themselves the extraordinary authority to divine what in the @entity2 is true and what is not , what is flawed and what is not , and where certain " amendments " supposedly need to occur , ' he told @entity59			0
movement : it comes after he upset @entity10 with his stance on guns , sparking petitions to deport him now a second petition on the @entity67 website now insists he must stay in the @entity10 , not only because he has a constitutional right to free speech but also ' more important ' because ' no one in the @entity9 wants him back ' it is just the latest of @entity0 's outspoken opinions to be spotlighted after he offended thousands of @entity10 with his anti-gun remarks			1
he has demanded tighter @entity10 gun laws following the @entity14 massacre and last week on @entity75 , he interviewed a gun advocate and called him an ' unbelievably stupid man '			1
on december 21 , a man in @entity80 launched a petition on the @entity67 e-petition website demanding @entity0 be deported immediately for ' exploiting his position as a national network television host to stage attacks against the rights of @entity10 citizens '			1
the petition accuses @entity0 of engaging in a ' hostile attack against the @entity10 constitution ' by targeting the @entity92 - the right to bear arms			1
anger : people took to @entity96 to lambast his latest remarks , adding to the voices who want him deported it has already garnered more than 84,000 signatures - far exceeding the 25,000 signature threshold required to get a @entity67 response			1
but @entity0 seemed unfazed by the effort to oust him			0
in a series of @entity96 messages , he urged his followers to sign the petition and in response to one article about the petition even said : ' bring it on '			2
he wrote : ' if i do get deported from @entity10 for wanting fewer gun murders , are there any other countries that will have me ? ' but a second petition on the same website now insists he must stay in the @entity10 , not only because he has a constitutional right to free speech but also - ' more important ' - because ' no one in the @entity9 wants him back '			1
response : the @entity67 defended the freedom of speech and the press on wednesday in a long - awaited response to an online petition to deport @entity1 host @entity0 over his views on gun control hundreds have signed the ' keep @entity0 in the @entity10 ' petition after it was proposed by @entity130 , a @entity131 - based website designer			1
to add to the former newspaper editor 's embarrassment , a third petition is calling on home secretary @entity135 to stop him from returning to @entity9			1
appearing on the @entity10 website change.org it has so far attracted more than 100 signatures and states : ' we got rid of him once and why should we have to suffer again			2
the @entity10 wanted him so they should put up with him			0
