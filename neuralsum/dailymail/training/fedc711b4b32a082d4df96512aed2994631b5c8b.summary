by @entity0 published : 18:26 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 18:26 est , 5 november 2012 backing a winner ? former vp candidate @entity2 has backed @entity3 for the @entity4 @entity2 held off until the eve of the 2012 presidential election to reveal that she had decided to back @entity3 and @entity7 for the @entity4			1
the former @entity9 governor posted a lengthy message on @entity11 detailing the reasons as to why she was behind the @entity15 candidates - and it was mostly a negative assessment of @entity16 's past four years			1
she wrote : ' on tuesday , please vote for governor @entity3 and the commonsense conservatives running for office in your states			1
' following her failed run for vice president alongside @entity22 in 2008 , @entity2 has been a vocal commentator on the race - but has stopped short of endorsing a candidate			1
at the primaries stage , she gave her vote to @entity15 hopeful and former house speaker @entity28			1
in the 19 - paragraph message posted on monday , @entity2 launched a scathing attack on president @entity16 , where she wrote : ' in 2008 , @entity16 promised to fundamentally transform @entity32			1
' and for all his failures and broken promises , that ’s the one thing he has delivered on			1
he ’s transformed us from a nation of hope to one of anxiety			2
it does n’t have to be this way			2
' almost 48,000 people ' liked ' @entity2 's message on her @entity11 page and it was shared close to 4,000 times			1
before now , @entity2 had not formally endorsed a candidate but her political action committee last week donated $ 5,000 to @entity3 's campaign			1
another one in the ballot box : @entity3 , pictured with wife @entity55 today in @entity56 , @entity54 has been backed by @entity2 backed by the a-list : he may not have @entity2 's vote but @entity16 can rely on the support of @entity60 and @entity61 , seen here today in @entity62 , @entity63 @entity2 , who is currently writing a motivational fitness book , has been prolific in her @entity11 posts during the 2012 campaign			1
she was mired in controversy last month when she took to the social network to say that @entity16 should end his ‘ shuck and jive shtick ’ over the death of @entity32 ambassador to @entity72 @entity71			1
the phrase has racist connotations among african - americans and is used to denote somebody being deceitful			2
she also weighed in on the vp debate between @entity7 and her adversary four years ago , @entity81			2
@entity2 said that moderator @entity82 had been ' tough ' on @entity7 and allowed @entity81 the run of the conversation			1
memories : @entity2 herself debated against @entity81 during the 2008 presidential election this tuesday our country ’s future is in our hands			1
what ’s past is prologue			2
we know what we will get from a second @entity16 term because we ’ve all endured his first term			1
we know how well he kept his 2008 campaign promises			1
do we really believe he ’ll keep his 2012 promises ? do we believe the word of a man who promised he would n’t raise taxes on the middle class , but then slammed the middle class with a massive tax hike in the form of @entity107 ( and do n’t forget that his own lawyers argued before the @entity110 that the individual mandate is a tax ) ? do we really believe he wo n’t raise taxes even more on every @entity32 in order to pay for his wasteful spending and his crony capitalism ? do we believe that the same president who increased the debt in his first term by more than all the first 41 presidents combined will suddenly decide to cut the deficit in his second term ? do we believe that the president whose reckless spending led us to the first credit rating downgrade in our nation ’s history will suddenly become a responsible fiscal manager if we reelect him ? do we really believe that a president who promised us that job creation was his number one priority despite month after month of dismal job numbers now has a credible ' plan ' for the job growth that eluded him for the past four years ? do we believe that the same president who shut down the @entity137 and blocks domestic oil and natural gas development at every turn is somehow going to reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil and lead us to energy independence ? do we really believe that our country ’s national security is safe in the hands of a president whose administration denied security and assistance to our consulate under attack on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on @entity32 , and then blamed that consulate attack and the death of our ambassador on a “ spontaneous ” protest over an obscure @entity160 video despite all the real time evidence to the contrary ? do we believe that a president who was caught on a hot mic telling the @entity166 president that he would have “ more flexibility ” after his reelection is being honest about his plans for a second term ? we know what we will get from a second @entity16 term			1
we will get the same failed policies			2
we will get @entity107 locked into law without any chance of undoing this dangerous legislation and any chance to seek real patient - centered health care reform			2
we will get a debt crisis			0
we will get more inflation and higher gas prices			0
we will get tax increases			0
we will get fewer jobs			0
we will get more small businesses collapsing under the weight of higher taxes and unfair regulation			0
we will get more corruption and crony capitalism favoring the @entity16 administration ’s friends			1
we will get less domestic energy development and increased dependence on terrorist sponsoring foreign regimes for our energy needs			0
we will get a “ blame @entity32 first ” foreign policy that bows to our enemies and snubs our friends like @entity200 and leaves @entity32 and the world less safe			1
we will get less opportunity and security for ourselves and for our children			0
in 2008 , @entity16 promised to fundamentally transform @entity32			1
and for all his failures and broken promises , that ’s the one thing he has delivered on			1
he ’s transformed us from a nation of hope to one of anxiety			0
it does n’t have to be this way			0
tuesday is our chance to turn things around			0
@entity3 and @entity7 have offered a credible alternative to @entity16 ’s failed policies			1
governor @entity3 understands how the free market works			2
his pro-growth economic policies will benefit all @entity32			0
he has promised to move us toward energy independence , deficit reduction , and responsible entitlement reform that honors our commitment to our seniors and keeps faith with future generations			0
governor @entity3 deserves a chance to lead			2
president @entity16 had his chance			1
he ’s failed , and we ca n’t afford to go backwards			0
we must also remember the many good @entity15 candidates who are running for the @entity4 and @entity231 this year			0
they deserve our support as well			0
if you are like me , you have watched these campaigns , learned about the candidates , and know where they stand despite the skewed lens of a partisan media bent on keeping liberal leadership in power			0
we saw the destruction a @entity243 controlled @entity4 , @entity244 , and @entity231 brought us after the 2008 election			0
our country ca n’t afford that again			0
your vote is the only safeguard against that happening			2
on tuesday , please vote for governor @entity3 and the commonsense conservatives running for office in your states			1
voting is our duty and our right			0
we must never forget the immense sacrifices generations of @entity32 , including our brave men and women in uniform today , have made to give us this right			0
and we must never forget the duty we owe to generations of @entity32 yet to be born to exercise our right to vote prudently			2
the @entity4 and control of the @entity231 is in the balance in this election , and every vote will count			2
i firmly believe it is our responsibility to restore this country and secure the blessings of liberty and prosperity for our children , just as it was secured for us			0
this is our sacred duty to the past and to the future			0
we will succeed in this so help us @entity279			0
@entity279 bless you and @entity281			0
with an @entity9 heart , @entity2			1
