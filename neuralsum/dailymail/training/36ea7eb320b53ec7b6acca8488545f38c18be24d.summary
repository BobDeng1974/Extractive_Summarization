by @entity0 published : 11:29 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 05:31 est , 13 august 2013 a band of forgotten women were hugely influential in the rise of @entity4 but their contribution has been neglected by the mainstream churches , a leading expert has claimed			1
professor @entity8 of the @entity9 has identified dozens of forgotten @entity11 women who were influential in the first and second centuries , during a period when @entity4 was - in some respects - more progressive towards women than today			1
she believes that women played a central role in spreading the new @entity11 faith through informal friendship and family networks			1
@entity21 of @entity22 , is believed by second century @entity11 to have been one of @entity25 's disciples			2
legend has it that @entity21 rebelled against her family to refuse marriage - an unthinkable act at the time their authority within @entity11 communities was earned through their role as parents , community organisers , and small business owners			1
one , @entity43 the purple - seller of @entity40 , remembered in the @entity42 ’s @entity41 , was the first person to sponsor @entity25			0
another woman , @entity45 , who lived in @entity46 at the end of the second century , was famous at the time for refusing to denounce her faith , choosing martyrdom against her father ’s wishes			0
her diary , written while she awaited execution in prison , was a radical document which would be seen in today ’s world as extreme and very unlike the official @entity11 views of what the @entity11 woman should be , said professor @entity60			2
one of the most important , she said , is @entity61 , believed by second century @entity11 to have been one of @entity25 ’s disciples			2
though there is no strong evidence that @entity21 existed , her story was hugely influential in the first few hundred years of @entity4 referring to the ‘ @entity66 ’ , an anonymous second century text , professor @entity60 shows how @entity21 rebelled against her family to refuse marriage - an unthinkable act at the time			1
' though there is no certain evidence that @entity21 existed , her story was hugely influential in the first few hundred years of early @entity4 , ' said professor @entity60 , who has written a new book entitled @entity73 : the @entity74			1
the influence of her story was far - reaching , in that it became the root of the @entity79 theology of chastity and virginity			0
' every major @entity11 male writer in the fourth century had a sister , and these young women were encouraged to follow @entity21 ’s example			1
' rather than criticising her for disobeying her mother , the early @entity86 celebrated her courage			0
' @entity4 was quite revolutionary in the way it treated its women , especially when you realise how sexist the ancient world was			2
' so it ’s sad that @entity21 and her contemporaries are not properly remembered and honoured today			0
they should be an inspiration : for example to the people campaigning for women bishops and priests			0
' women , says professor @entity60 , regularly preached the gospel in the first two centuries of @entity4 , and in some communities women carried out baptisms			1
it was n’t until the roman emperor @entity111 ’s conversion to @entity4 , in around 313 ad , the religion became institutionalised : male bishops were now government officials and women came to be seen as players in the background rather than public figures			1
professor @entity60 added : ' these women – saints who had a radical and powerful presence in the early church – have been hidden in plain sight			0
' @entity122 stories , for example – such as the story of @entity125 in the @entity126 – can tell us far more about women ’s role if we stop to pay close attention – something male writers have not done			2
' the ancient sources mention the women , but over time less and less attention was given to their role			0
really , they have been airbrushed out of history			0
' it is quite sad that a religion which began with a mother and her wonderful baby should still have so much difficulty with remembering to honour the contribution of its women			0

professor @entity8 of the @entity9 has identified dozens of women who were influential in the first and second centuries
their authority within @entity11 communities was earned through their role as parents , community organisers , and small business owners
but when @entity111 converted to @entity4 in 313 ad , the religion became institutionalised with male bishops and members of *clergy*
