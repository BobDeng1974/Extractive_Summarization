@entity0 has announced the latest in a long line of merchandise inspired by its hit animated movie frozen - a range of princess @entity6 and @entity8 beauty products			1
the make - up collection includes an eyeshadow palette - complete with separate @entity6 and @entity8 color schemes - three lipsticks , four nail polishes , and a set of rollerball eye pigments , however , much to the dismay of @entity19 fans everywhere , the products can only be purchased at @entity0 's @entity21 - based theme parks in @entity22 and @entity23			1
unsurprisingly , each of the different items has been given a suitably wintry moniker , with shades such as ' @entity28 ' and ' frozen queen ' among some of the names included			0
last week it was revealed that @entity19 has become the most profitable animated @entity0 movie of all time , with profits now estimated at more than $ 1.1 billion , a number which is continuing to increase at a rapid rate , despite the fact that the film was released more than a year ago			0
but this latest range of frozen - themed products is believed to be aimed at a slightly older audience than those sell - out items that have proved so successful with children around the world			1
according to @entity67 , the make - up launch signifies @entity0 's attempt to ' reach out to grown - up fans ' of the animated musical by enabling them to recreate their favorite look worn by the central characters in the film			1
for the powerful princess @entity6 , that means cool - toned purples and sparkling silver shades , while the younger @entity8 has been given a much warmer palette of browns , golds and pinks			2
are you an @entity6 or an @entity8 ? the range includes an eyeshadow palette which can be used to create two looks , based on the movie 's central characters			1
for @entity6 ( @entity87 ) that means cool purple tones , while the colors for @entity8 ( r ) are much warmer @entity51 favorites : @entity93 @entity0 's most popular merchandise the launch of the beauty range has come at the perfect time for @entity0 , which is eagerly capitalizing on the continued success of its big - screen hit at every available opportunity			1
twelve months after its release , and with the festive season fast approaching , @entity19 hysteria has reached fever - pitch , with dozens of big name stores , from @entity106 to @entity107 , reporting that they have sold out of almost every @entity19 toy , with the most popular @entity6 and @entity8 dolls selling out months ago , as parents attempted to get in ahead of the @entity51 rush			2
as early as march , @entity0 had shifted half a million @entity8 and @entity6 dolls at $ 94 each			2
two months later they had sold out of dolls altogether , only for desperate parents to discover them re-appearing on @entity116 , being auctioned for four times their retail price			0
last month , the company revealed that it had sole more than 3 million frozen princess costumes this year alone , with many designs still sold out			0
child psychologist dr @entity121 told the @entity123 's @entity122 that little girls ' desire to emulate their friends is helping fuel the demand for more frozen goodies			0
' peer pressure and pester power hit their peak at six or seven , ' she said			0
' children want to fit in , and having the popular toy becomes important			0

the beauty products are only available to buy at @entity137 and @entity138
it is hoped that the beauty items , which are inspired by the film 's central characters @entity8 and @entity6 , will appeal to an older audience
