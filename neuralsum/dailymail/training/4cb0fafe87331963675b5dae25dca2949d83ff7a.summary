by @entity0 published : 11:00 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 5 august 2013 the september glossies are the most important magazines of the year for the fashion industry i have just spent the last two days immersed in the september issues of our great @entity7 glossies			1
the september issue , as fans of the documentary of the same name might recall , is the most important of the year			1
its job is to plug the new autumn / winter collections , and thus garner valuable advertising spend			2
so , you expect the most surprising covers , the funniest writing , the most insightful edits of the many , many clothes out there , and great new ideas we can all @entity24 , am i now poised , credit card in hand , to purchase my new winter wardrobe ? do i have a wealth of beauty tips at my disposal ? plus relationship advice , ideas on what to read and see ? um , not exactly … today , i am reviewing @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			1
tomorrow , i will tackle @entity38 , @entity39 , and online magazine @entity40 , brought to us by @entity40			1
vogue , £ 3.99 cover star : @entity45 supermodel @entity44 , wearing a frankly old - hat orange biker jacket by @entity47 , over a tartan sweater by @entity49			2
it ’s a fresh - faced , casual photo , but i ’d have liked something more polished and @entity53 fashion : @entity35 has shot my favourite look of the new season – @entity57 ’s black negligee dress , £ 1525 – on model @entity58			1
she appears over 26 pages , a mix of editorial and ads. the shoots are stupendous , but why has @entity35 ditched more dash than @entity66 in its entirety ? features : interviews with @entity70 and @entity71 ( the latter makes me wonder : why ? )			1
an investigation into the fur trade has a staggering statistic : 69 per cent of designers used fur in their autumn / winter collections			1
this is @entity80 , frequently lauded as the @entity81 : ‘ fur gives an added depth of luxury			1
’ deputy editor @entity85 is won over : mink live in ‘ straw - filled cages ’ , and ‘ do n’t show distress ’			1
she watches the mink killed , aged six months : ‘ they are taken from their huts and gassed			2
in 20 seconds they are asleep , gone			2
’ foxes are electrocuted , ‘ it ’s instantaneous , i promise you ’			0
@entity85 points out farmers ‘ rely [ on the astrakhan trade , where lamb foetuses are aborted for their pelt ] on the trade … are we right to remove that income ? ' celebrity muttering : @entity70 says , ‘ i weigh myself every day … i have three baths a day			0
’ and he has a new baby			0
how on earth does he fit it all in ? most useless piece of advice : let a strap fall off one shoulder @entity113 on the cover of this month 's @entity36 @entity36 , £ 3.90cover star : @entity113			1
i mean , who cares , really ? in @entity119 fashion : page after page of @entity121			2
lots of catwalk pictures , which to me spells @entity124 : the most sycophantic backstage report from @entity57 , viz : ‘ an unprecedented invitation to the pre-show @entity130 green room is offered			0
talk about final fashion frontiers			2
i am giddy with anticipation			0
a couple of models have been up since 2am			0
beautiful fabrics , beautiful furs … ’ celebrity muttering : at @entity137 , @entity136 reveals , ‘ i was so tired i kept falling asleep at the film premiere ; there was a lot of shouting which woke me up			0
’ most useless piece of advice : create a mood board to help show your hair colourist the exact shade you are after … @entity37 wins the battle of the glossies @entity37 , £ 4cover star : @entity151 in tweed @entity153 shorts , which have the effect of truncating her legs @entity157 fashion : the best of all the magazines , with the most pages			1
i love the way they do day and night looks with one key garment , and the respect paid to @entity166 versions of all the key looks			0
i really ca n’t fault the coverage , plus there is much less ‘ advice ’ from the dreaded interns , which i felt devalued @entity37 ’s stance as being in the @entity173 : i ’m not wild about new columnist @entity175 so far , and while the feature on what successful women were up to aged 25 was a good idea , it did n’t quite come off			1
but at least this magazine tries to be @entity182 muttering : @entity151 does n’t know what @entity183 means			0
it is explained to her			0
‘ i ’m going to remember that word ’			0
most useless piece of advice : the feature headline ‘ is your lunch break ageing you ? ’ is a bit daft			0
another page tells readers … how to wash their hair !			0
