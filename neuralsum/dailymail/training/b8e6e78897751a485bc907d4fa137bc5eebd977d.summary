@entity5 , 16 , and her friend @entity6 , 15 , vanished from their @entity8 homes earlier this year			1
soon afterwards they posted images of themselves branding @entity13 rifles , surrounded by armed men - photos which @entity1 police feared were acting as militant recruitment posters for young girls			1

on the right is 15 - year - old @entity6 who went with her - it is believed one of the girls is now dead @entity5 and @entity6 in a photo they posted online			1
last week , police expressed their fears that the two were inspiring other girls to flee to @entity3 to take up holy war it is not yet known which one of the teenagers has been killed as the death is yet to be officially confirmed by the @entity1 government			1
@entity35 , spokesperson for the @entity36 , told @entity37 : ' we also have this information and have checked it , but can not say with absolute certainty that it is true			0

the motivations of the two @entity53 girls are unclear but before leaving , they had contact with @entity56 youths , and visited a mosque in @entity8 's second district			1

the fears appeared to be validated with the @entity1 @entity36 confirming two other girls from @entity8 had attempted to flee to take up the call for holy war			1
little information was given about the latest pair hoping to join @entity4 apart from the fact that one was 16 and the other was 14 and their parents were apparently from @entity83			0

meanwhile , two @entity121 were intercepted in a @entity123 border town on the way to @entity3 via @entity1			0
@entity1 @entity36 spokesman @entity35 said they were noticing an increasing problem with youngsters wanting to leave the country for the same reason			2
