by @entity0 health officials are worried about recent @entity3 measles outbreaks that have caused more illnesses than at the same point of any year since 1996			1
authorities say 129 cases in 13 states were reported by mid-april , the bulk of them in @entity11 and @entity12			1
most were triggered by travelers who caught the virus abroad and spread it in the @entity3 among unvaccinated people			1
the @entity3 numbers remain relatively tiny , but officials are worried to see case counts growing			1
since 2000 , the highly contagious disease has been considered eliminated in the @entity3 , aside from occasional small outbreaks sparked by overseas travelers			1
for most of the last decade , the nation was seeing only about 60 cases a year but since 2010 , the average has been nearly 160			1
' this increase in cases may be a “ new normal , ” unfortunately , ' said dr. @entity41 , an infectious disease expert at @entity43 in @entity44			1
a double - edged sword is causing part of the problem : decades of measles vaccination campaigns have been so successful that many doctors have never seen a case , do n't realize how contagious it is , and may not take necessary steps to stop it from spreading			1
' new normal ' : dr @entity54 says that the increasing rate of measles cases in the @entity3 appears to be a growing - and steadying - trend among the 58 cases reported from @entity11 , at least 11 were infected in doctor 's offices , hospitals or other health - care settings , according to a report released thursday by the @entity64			1
@entity12 health officials say two of their 26 cases were infected in medical facilities			2
' it 's a shock to younger physicians that their own waiting room or emergency room is where people can get measles , ' said the @entity64 's dr. @entity76			0
also on thursday , a medical journal — the @entity78 — released a commentary warning doctors to prevent that kind of situation			2
' we must ensure that our facilities do not become centers for secondary measles transmission , ' wrote dr. @entity87 , an infectious disease specialist at the @entity89			2
she urged doctors who suspect a measles case to place the patient in an isolation room with special ventilation that keeps the air from circulating around the building			2
doctors and nurses should also wear surgical masks or respirators to protect themselves from getting infected , and to ask the infected patient to wear a surgical mask too			2
the measles virus spreads easily through the air , and in closed rooms			0
infected droplets can linger for up to two hours after the sick person leaves			0
it causes a fever , runny nose , cough and a rash all over the body			0
in rare cases , measles can be deadly , and is particularly dangerous for children			1
infection can also cause pregnant women to have a miscarriage or premature birth			0
before a vaccine became available about 50 years ago , nearly all children got measles by their 15th birthday			0
in those days , nearly 500 @entity3 died from measles each year			1
a bad resurgence of measles hit the nation in 1989 to 1991 , when 55,000 cases were reported			2
that flood of cases was blamed on a widespread failure to vaccinate uninsured children			2
in reaction , the federal government started a program in 1994 to pay for vaccines for kids who are uninsured , in the @entity139 program , or meet other criteria			0
anti-vaccination : the number of @entity3 chosing not to get vaccinated has gone up in recent years and a host of celebrities - including @entity145 ( left ) and @entity146 ( right ) have been outspoken in their support of mothers opting out of the shots for their children in a report released thursday , @entity64 officials estimated that the program and other childhood vaccination efforts will prevent 322 million illnesses and 732,000 premature deaths over the course of the lifetimes of children born in the years 1994 through 2013			1
wrapped into that estimate are 71 million measles cases , nearly 9 million measles hospitalizations and 57,000 measles deaths			2
there has been no measles deaths reported in the @entity3 since 2003			1
' but the way we 're going , we feel it ( another ) is inevitable , ' @entity76 said			0
today , the measles vaccination rate is above 95 per cent for children of kindergarten age			0
but there has been a small but growing trend of parents seeking exemptions for their children from school - entry vaccination requirements for religious or philosophical reasons			0
other parents have tried to space out , or delay , measles vaccinations because of fears that the shot will trigger autism or other problems			0
measles outbreaks are more common in communities where such beliefs are more common , experts say			0
' it 's often concentrated there			0
folks who think similarly tend to live in the same neighborhood or attend the same religious organization , ' @entity41 said			0
the @entity64 national tally may already be outdated			0
also on thursday , @entity197 officials announced a new cluster of 13 suspected cases in rural @entity200			1
at least three traveled to the @entity21 last month on a religious humanitarian mission			1
about 17 per cent of @entity3 cases this year were vaccinated			1
health officials say that although the vaccine is very effective , it 's not perfect .			0

so far this year there have been 129 cases in 13 states
annual average was about 60 per year until 2010 and since then the number has shot to about 160
doctors say most of the cases have stemmed from travelers arriving in @entity3 after visiting the @entity21 , where a epidemic has broken out
the travelers spread the disease to the growing number of unvaccinated @entity3
many @entity3 doctors are so *unfamiliar* with the disease because it is so rare that they are *misdiagnosing* the cases or *unaware* of the
