the @entity1 , may 21 , 2008 : as @entity3 and @entity4 ’s players are hit by a wall of sound as they emerge for the @entity7 final , a young coach is dreaming			1
all around , flashbulbs are popping as cameras capture images of the players who are about to contest the greatest game in club football			0
gleaming on a platform in the distance is that unmistakable trophy , the one that defines careers			0
at that moment , @entity19 — youth coach under @entity3 manager @entity20 — knew his life ’s ambition			1
@entity19 talks to the media ahead of his debut as a @entity7 manager on tuesday night ‘ i remember walking out of the tunnel when the teams were coming out , ’ says @entity27 ’s manager			1
‘ i was behind them and i was picturing myself as the manager in a @entity7 final			2
i was wondering what it might be like			0
‘ with all the experiences of games in that period , they all helped me because in my mind i was looking at the game and making decisions as a manager			0
to arrive and be at that level is great			0
@entity44 shows his agony after missing a penalty in the 2008 @entity7 final shootout @entity48 and sir @entity49 celebrate @entity4 's victory over @entity3 in @entity51 ‘ when we were walking out in @entity51 , i was framing the mindset that one day — if this was to happen to me — then i will have been here before			1
hopefully , it is something that becomes real			0
’ @entity19 is not suggesting that he envisages that dream coming true in @entity58 ’s @entity57 next june but , for now , to lead @entity27 in the competition after a five - year absence is a step in the right direction			1
when he arrived at @entity64 two years ago , @entity19 ’ mission was to get @entity27 back in the @entity7 but it is only in the past two days , as he prepared for tuesday night ’s tussle with @entity68 ’s @entity67 , that he has truly appreciated the significance			1
this , after all , is the tournament that enchants the five - time winners like no other			0

with @entity92 champions @entity91 also in @entity93 , another famous @entity64 night may be just around the corner			0
‘ it hits home as soon as you actually see ourselves back in the @entity7 how much it can actually be missed , ’ says @entity19			1
‘ i looked at the footballs ( with the @entity7 logos ) at @entity101 the other day			2
little simple touches like that let you know this is where this club has to be			0

at 41 — to be able to get the chance — it ’s really young but it ’s something i ’m looking forward to			0

@entity122 has been elevated to this position as reward for the progress he has made since @entity19 has been at the club			2
as @entity122 prepares to take another significant step forward , @entity19 believes the same is true of @entity27 as a club			1
‘ @entity130 is someone who represents a lot of what we are about , ’ said @entity19			2
@entity122 ( left ) has emerged as a key player for @entity27 under @entity19 ‘ he and @entity138 are the moral compass of our group : how they conduct themselves on and off the field , how they train , how they work			1
