by @entity0 last updated at 7:10 pm on 16th november 2011 @entity1 : @entity2 is set to name his new @entity4 government today economist @entity2 today formed a new @entity4 government without a single politician - drawing from the ranks of bankers , diplomats and business executives to make sure @entity4 escapes looming financial disaster			1
the 68 - year - old former @entity13 competition commissioner told reporters he will serve as @entity4 's economy minister as well as premier for now as he seeks to implement ' sacrifices ' to heal the country 's finances and set the economy growing again			1
@entity2 and his new cabinet ministers will be sworn later wednesday , formally ending @entity23 's 3 1/2 - year - old government as well as his 17 - year - long run of political dominance			1
@entity2 said he would lay out his emergency anti-crisis policies in the @entity27 on thursday , ahead of a confidence vote			1
a second vote , in the lower @entity30 , will follow , likely on friday			1
he stressed that @entity4 's economic growth is a top priority			1
hopes for @entity4 's new administration won it some respite in financial markets today			1
the yield on its ten - year bonds dropped 0.16 percentage point to 6.77 per cent			1
in the last week , that borrowing rate had flirted over 7 percent - the level that forced fellow eurozone members @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 to seek international bailouts			2
up until summer , @entity4 had mostly avoided the @entity48 debt turmoil despite having a jaw - dropping amount of debt : 1.9 trillion euro , or nearly 120 per cent of its gdp			1
but after frequent delays and backtracking on austerity measures , markets lost faith that any @entity23 government could fix @entity4 's economic issues			1
restoring confidence in @entity4 's financial future is crucial because , as the third - largest economy in the eurozone , it is too big for @entity48 to rescue			1
a debt default by @entity4 would threaten the euro itself and shake the global economy			1
new government : mr @entity2 poses with the new members of the @entity4 government after the swearing in ceremony at the @entity75 presidential palace in @entity76 discussions : @entity2 ( centre ) sits yesterday during a meeting with industrialists and union representatives at the @entity27 , in @entity76 , as he tries to form a new government @entity2 gave few hints about his political programme today , sidestepping a question about whether the government would dip into citizens ' bank accounts as it did decades ago during another debt crisis			1
' you may ask , he replied , but went no further			2
explaining why his cabinet contained no one from @entity4 's fractious political parties , @entity2 said that his talks with party leaders led him to the conclusion ' that the non-presence of politicians in the government would help it			1
' his ministers include @entity100 , ceo of @entity4 's second - largest bank , @entity101 , to head development and infrastructure ; @entity104 , a longtime chairman of @entity107 utility company , as @entity109 and @entity110 minister in a country heavily dependent on tourist revenues ; and the current @entity4 ambassador to @entity114 , @entity113 , to be foreign minister			1
@entity116 's ruling socialist government is expected to tumble on sunday			2
voters braving sky - high unemployment , the sting of austerity , piles of debt and a bleak future are expected to dump the @entity125 at the country 's general elections			2
the opposition conservative party , the @entity128 ruled by @entity129 , is riding high in the polls			2
but it could come after @entity116 's yields on 10 year bonds break the critical 7 per cent barrier , which forced @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity43 to be bailed out by the eurozone			2
the interest rate currently stands at a dangerous 6.39 per cent			2
a historian of the @entity138 with close ties to the @entity140 , @entity141 , was named minister of international and domestic cooperation , a choice that seemed to reward @entity146 lawmakers in @entity147			2
a @entity2 government is ' an historic and significant turn of events ' , said @entity151 of the @entity146 centrists			2
still , his choices raised some eyebrows			2
critics have pointed out that @entity4 will now be governed by a band of ' non elected pipe smoking and tweed wearing university dons ' - although @entity2 does have the backing of all the major @entity4 political parties			1
' this government , ties to banks , to business , to the @entity140 , to private universities - to the usual names - is the opposite of what this country needs , ' said @entity171 , leader of @entity172 , a tiny , far - left party			2
@entity100 also sits on the board of directors of @entity175 's @entity174 , which forms @entity4 's business elite			1
@entity2 is currently the head of the @entity174			2
but analysts gave @entity2 's selections a top mark , insisting the cabinet ministers were independent			0
' i think the quality of the people is very high , ' said @entity185 , a political science professor at @entity76 's @entity186			1
' all these people are very high - caliber , and highly respected , independent			0
' @entity4 's economy is hampered by high wage costs , low productivity , fat government payrolls , excessive taxes , choking bureaucracy and low numbers of college graduates			1
but @entity2 says @entity4 can beat the crisis if its largely polarized citizenry - often bitterly divided over @entity23 's long tenure - can pull together			1
he has also met with union leaders and business representatives			0
' i hope that , governing well , we can make a contribution to the calming and the cohesion of the political forces , ' @entity2 told reporters			1
the head of @entity4 's largest union confederation , @entity210 , backed @entity2 but hoped he ' wo n't put his priority on pensions '			1
@entity147 on saturday voted to raise the retirement age as part of an austerity package to 67 by 2026 and 70 by 2050 , but critics say those reforms are meaningless because they are so far in the future			0
the new changes also call for the sale of state property and privatizing some services but contain no painful labor reforms			0
they also offer tax incentives to companies that hire young workers to fight @entity4 's 25 percent unemployment rate for people ages 15 to 24			1
the shift in power away from career politicians had caused bickering within @entity23 's conservative @entity234 , which eventually endorsed @entity2			0
but @entity23 's main coalition ally , the @entity235 , has announced it will stay in the opposition during @entity2 's government			0
out of sight : a torn poster of outgoing prime minister @entity23 's @entity240 reads ' ready to double			0
thank you @entity23 ' @entity151 predicted on @entity242 that @entity2 's government would win the confidence votes and last until the end of the legislature in spring 2013 , to the dismay of many of @entity23 's allies , who want elections in a few months			0
' the economic crisis wo n't be solved in a brief time , ' he noted			0
not everyone was enthusiastic about an unelected , technocratic government			0
' when governments of technocrats are needed , it means democracy and politics are considered useless , so it 's something negative that has to be for a limited period of time , ' said skeptic @entity262 on the streets of @entity76			0
@entity43 's new government was today expected to easily survive a vote of confidence , despite cracks already appearing in the crisis coalition			0
new prime minister @entity270 will then face the daunting task repairing the shattered public finances			0
new era : @entity270 ( left ) has taken over as @entity43 pm from @entity274 ( right ) polls show @entity270 , former vice president of the @entity276 , has the backing of three in four @entity43			1
a @entity43 electricity workers ' union has flipped the switch on the country 's health ministry building in @entity284 in protest at unpaid state bills			0
a union statement said the four - hour power cut was decided as the ministry owes the @entity290 ( @entity290 ) 3.8 million euro			0
it said the state has run up a total debt of 141 million euros			0
the ministry said the building was expected to be reconnected at 12noon			0
the @entity290 workers ' union is protesting over a new property tax which is being levied through household electricity bills - with people who do not pay facing the prospect of having their power supply cut			0
but the need to implement painful tax rises and spending cuts to secure fresh loans and stave off bankruptcy will sorely test that support			0
at stake are an 8 billion euro loan tranche @entity43 needs to meet debt repayments due next month and a new bailout worth 130 billion euros			0
@entity43 needs some 80 billion euros of that second rescue package in early 2012			0
@entity270 's national unity government brings together bitter rivals , the conservative @entity316 of @entity317 , the @entity318 of fallen prime minister @entity274 and the far - right @entity321 party			0
the vote is scheduled for 1pm but may be delayed			0
on the eve of the confidence motion , @entity316 lawmakers defied the @entity327 's request for a written pledge from the three parties on meeting the terms of @entity43 's bailout			1
the party said it would not bow to @entity333			0
@entity316 mp @entity334 said orders ' from @entity333 can not be a legitimate policy ' .			0
