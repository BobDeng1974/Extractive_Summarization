in a bizarre revelation , former @entity7 peer @entity6 revealed he had nominated the @entity3 president for his recent actions in @entity11			1
however the @entity7 moved quickly to disown the idea , insisting it was not party policy to give a gong to the president			1
gong : @entity3 's president @entity2 has been nominated for the @entity16 wreckage : a damaged vehicle is seen on a street with buildings damaged by what activists said was shelling by forces loyal to @entity11 's president @entity22 in the besieged area of @entity24 last week @entity6 took the @entity25 by surprise at question time by announcing that he had taken the unusual step over nominating @entity2 for the prize			1
instead the prize this week went to the @entity31 , the international body overseeing the destruction of @entity11 's chemical arsenal			0
@entity6 , who sits as a non-affiliated peer after being suspended for misconduct in 2009 , said : ‘ many people would argue that the @entity3 - led @entity11 peace plan is the most significant peace initiative this year			1
@entity6 , who nominated @entity2 , was kicked out of the @entity7 four years ago ‘ to recognise this and encourage @entity3 in its peace - making endeavours , a few hours ago , i nominated president @entity2 for the @entity5 peace prize			1
’ the peer , who has written a biography of the president , asked if the government would dissent from such a move			0
but this was sidestepped by cabinet office spokesman @entity51 of @entity52 , who told him : ‘ this has been a joint @entity55 - @entity3 peace initiative			0
it 's not purely a @entity3 - led peace initiative			0
‘ we welcome the constructive response @entity3 is now making on @entity11 and we hope and expect that the @entity3 will ensure president @entity22 and his regime are represented at the @entity62 peace conference at the end of november			2
’ however @entity7 frontbencher @entity64 told peers : ‘ i should make clear that it 's no part of the official opposition 's policy to nominate president @entity2 for the @entity5 peace prize			2
’ the initiative to destroy @entity11 's chemical weapons was ‘ plainly welcome ’ but there was still much more to do to secure peace , he said			2
@entity6 and another @entity74 were suspended for six months in 2009 after being found by a @entity25 committee to be willing to change laws in exchange for cash			0
the two men denied the allegations made by the @entity81			0
@entity6 , who resigned from the @entity7 , argued he has been made a scapegoat .			0

tells the lords how @entity3 president helped secure peace in @entity11
but shelling and *bloodshed* has *continued* on both sides for months
@entity7 moved quickly to disown the idea from the *disgraced* peer
