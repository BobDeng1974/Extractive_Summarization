@entity1 swimming champion @entity0 has spoken about his life - changing five - week stint in an @entity5 rehab clinic this year , confessing that his addiction to @entity8 sleeping pills played a major role in him seeking help			1
the gold medallist also said that a ' sustained amount of pressure and stress ' and his bitter divorce from @entity17 singer @entity16 led him to get treatment			1
speaking exclusively to @entity19 about his rehab experience for the first time , he said he was reluctant and ' scared ' to go to the @entity23 clinic - but was persuaded to go by his dad			1
' i was in denial about [ help ] for a long time , i thought i could manage everything and anything , ’ he said on thursday			2
after his initial reluctance , the 34 - year - old admitted he formed ‘ great relationships ’ from the experience			1
' there was a bit of reluctance because you do n’t know what you ’re getting yourself into , ’ @entity0 said			0
he confessed he was a ‘ little bit frightened ’ and a ‘ little bit scared ’ before boarding the plane to @entity23 but he has now described his time away as a ‘ great personal development ’ lesson and has spoken about the great friends he made inside the clinic			1
' i got a real insight into myself , what motivates me , where i ’ve had difficulties throughout my life , ' he said			0
' a lot of people in there were really high - achieving individuals who had just been through tough periods			1
' it 's a very safe environment where you feel you can make yourself vulnerable and recover properly			2
through the course of that vulnerability you do make great relationships , ' he said			1
it was initially reported @entity0 entered rehab because of an addiction to @entity74 , a prescription anti-anxiety drug and sleeping pill that is given to patients to treat insomnia and anxiety			1
until now he has declined to say that the drug actually led to his admittance			0
' it was n’t really that to be honest , i have to steer a bit clear of that because of legal proceedings … but what i can tell you is that yes , definitely , i was using sleeping medication for a little while there , but that was n’t the only thing , ' he confessed			2
divorced : the olympian 's troubles came after his divorce from @entity17 singer @entity16 in august 2013 panicked : the olympian was seen wondering the foyer of @entity37 , @entity38 , half - naked in february he also said his hectic life as an executive at @entity101 , a presenter at @entity102 , studying for a master ’s degree and ' going through a very very public divorce that was extremely difficult to cope with ' meant he did n’t give himself the time to rest			1
' i was doing that not for weeks or months – i did that for years , it ’s just not a sustainable way of living			2
' @entity0 and @entity16 first announced their separation in 2012 and divorced in august 2013			1
' because of my athletic background i thought it was a weakness to say " i need help " , ' he said			0

long term use : @entity0 was first prescribed @entity74 over ten years ago by doctors to help him wind down after competitions ' extremely difficult ' : @entity0 confessed he was going through ' a very very public divorce ' and did not give himself enough time to rest he said what rehab really helped him to do was get to the root of his problems and thus rid himself of his reliance on the medication			1
' why was n’t i sleeping ? why was n’t i feeling like i was on top of it ? ... it ’s more getting to the crux of it and also getting rid of those band aid solutions			0
' doctors first prescribed @entity74 over ten years ago , to help him switch off at night after competitions			1
' sometimes you ca n't come down after those events			0
that 's why i used @entity74 back then			1
it was the particular medication that doctors prescribed			2
10 odd years ago they said " this is the medication to use " because it does n’t have too many side effects … and it 's got no hangover effect , ' he explained			1
@entity0 has battled with an addiction to the drug previously and in 2012 he called it ' evil '			0
he said when he was first prescribed the pill it was ‘ absolutely innocent ’ and he holds no grudges against the doctors who gave it to him			2
' you could wake up the next morning and compete at the highest level again , so that was the rational and logic behind it			0
' ' sometimes you ca n't come down after those events ' : @entity0 is one of @entity17 's most decorated olympians but said he 's also an ' over thinker ' sleeping aid : @entity0 has battled with an addiction to @entity74 previously and in 2012 he called it ' evil '			1
he said when he was first prescribed the pill it was ' absolutely innocent ' @entity0 said although not all athletes have trouble switching off at night he is the ' sort of person with a very analytical mind '			1
' i ’m a real thinker so often for me to do that , switch off , is not necessarily as easy as it is for the average person , ' he explained			2
his advice to any young athletes looking for help now would be to ' avoid it all costs '			0
these days @entity0 turns to more natural remedies , including meditation and mindfulness to wind down			0
' it 's not the sort of stuff i was a big believer in before … but i try and do that at the end of each day just to get out of my own head so to speak			2
' and his personal life is also back to a ' very happy place '			0
