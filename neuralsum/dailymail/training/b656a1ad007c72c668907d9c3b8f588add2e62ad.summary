@entity0 , who has been jailed for 40 months after stealing more than £ 2.5million from friends to fund a lavish lifestyle dressed immaculately in designer clothes with @entity5 accessories , @entity0 simply reeked of success			1
seduced by her perfectly groomed appearance , a ' @entity10 lifestyle ' and tales of her success refurbishing properties , friends were persuaded to sink huge sums of money into her business			2
but the investments were used to fund her taste for luxuries , which included a converted barn home with @entity22 furniture , trips to top restaurants and five - star holidays – one on a @entity28 cruise with a personal butler			1
when police caught up with her she had burned through more than £ 2.5 million			2
one victim lost £ 1,050,000 and others lost six - figure sums			1
they are unlikely to get much back as @entity34 , 63 , was £ 8,000 overdrawn when she was arrested			1
she has now been jailed for more than three years after a judge told her she had ' swindled and cheated ' her friends , some of whom needed treatment for stress and depression			2
one victim , a friend of @entity34 's husband @entity44 for 45 years who lost £ 115,000 , said : ' i trusted her like a sister and did n't think anything was wrong			1
i knew about her lavish lifestyle and just thought it was because her business was doing well			1
' another victim , who had known her for ten years and handed over £ 43,000 , said : ' she 's an awful woman			2
she showed no remorse at all			0
' financial adviser @entity55 , from @entity56 , who lost over a million pounds , declined to talk yesterday			2
but in a victim impact statement read out in court , he described how he had spent 40 years working hard so that he could enjoy his retirement			1
' i now feel guilt and shame having to live with this error for the rest of my life and knowing my family will suffer , ' he said			1
a former next - door neighbour who went shopping and holidayed with the conwoman suffered a nervous breakdown after giving her £ 722,500			1
@entity34 was a well - known figure in @entity72 , @entity73 , where she lived in an £ 800,000 detached house with an integrated speaker system piping music into every room			1
a @entity77 and a new @entity78 were parked outside			0
she and her husband , who is believed to be retired , would regularly go on holiday			0
@entity83 @entity82 heard she spent about £ 60,000 a year travelling and would fly first class			1
life of luxury : her @entity88 villa was ' like something out of @entity91 's wives ' favourite destinations included @entity93 , where she stayed in the @entity95 , a favourite haunt of the ultra-rich and the famous			2
she also visited @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 in @entity88 , where she had a four - bedroom villa which was described as ' like something out of @entity10 '			2
when in @entity104 she visited the @entity105 and she even treated one victim 's family to afternoon tea at the @entity109 in @entity110			0
but the enviable lifestyle was built upon her victims ' misery			1
the greedy property investor , whose primary business was in @entity117 , began encouraging friends to hand over money and would string them along with excuses to avoid paying them back			2
one victim even hired a private investigator when she stopped returning calls and disappeared from her home for a while			0
she was finally arrested in september 2012 when a victim contacted the police – eight years after the scams began			0
@entity34 's scheme was based entirely on goodwill			0
her victims did n't enter into formal contracts when they handed over the life - changing sums			1
instead , they relied on the trust they had built up with an old friend			2
they were told the money was being invested in buying properties before they were sold on for a profit			0
when they enquired about their investments , they were assured they were safely locked up in deals			0
some had no idea they were a victim of theft until the police contacted them in 2012			0
some of @entity34 's victims were in the public gallery at @entity83 @entity82 , pictured , and watched as she was led away to begin her sentence prosecutor @entity158 told the court on monday : ' no doubt in the past she had been a successful businesswoman working in property refurbishing , renting and selling in @entity117			1
' but a time came when , for reasons best known to herself , she started to steal from her friends and associates			0
' some of @entity34 's six victims were in court when she was sentenced to 40 months in jail after admitting seven charges of theft			1
during the hearing it emerged her house had been repossessed			0
her husband is now understood to live in a nearby village			0
recorder @entity178 said that her victims had suffered ' substantial losses '			0
he added : ' the money has been spent by you on lavish and extravagant luxuries			1
' the impact on their lives has been immense			0
your behaviour has ruined them			0
you built up a relationship of trust and you breached that trust			0
