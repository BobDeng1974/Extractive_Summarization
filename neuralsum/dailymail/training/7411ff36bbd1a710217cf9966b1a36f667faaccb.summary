by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 17:32 est , 1 july 2013 updated : 01:33 est , 2 july 2013 form of expression : this gesture is commonly used by @entity4 as a sign of disbelief waving your hands in the air is as undeniably @entity10 as buffalo mozzarella , bankruptcy and bunga bunga			1
but the well known tradition of gesturing is not just an expression of their extensive range of emotions – @entity10 use around 250 distinct hand signals in everyday conversation , experts have revealed			2
gestures , most of which originated in @entity24 , generally include fingers flying horizontally from the chin , exaggerated shrugs and upheld palms , and lots of exasperated cries and raised eyebrows			1
some are offensive – meaning ‘ gay ’ or ‘ cuckold ’			2
but many are mundane : ‘ can i have a cigarette ’ , ‘ call me ’			0
or ‘ tastes good ’ , virtually all now internationally recognised gestures			1
perhaps the best known is the one used regularly by @entity38 to express disbelief at the stupidity of what someone is saying			0
the hands are slightly cupped , with the finger tips forming upward - pointing cones which are shaken more or less violently , depending on the degree of exasperation			0
very common in @entity24 , it translates as ‘ what do you want ? ’ professor of psychology at @entity54 and an expert on gestures , @entity51 has identified 250 individual signs , that she says are akin to a language in their own right			1
the signs can have quite complex meanings , she told the @entity63 ; ‘ there are gestures expressing a threat or a wish or desperation or shame or pride , ’ she said			1
the sign for ‘ i do n’t give a * * * * ’ is an act of defiance			0
: ‘ it ’s a rebellion against power , a way of reacquiring one ’s own dignity			0
’ the only thing that separates hand gestures from sign language is that they are used individually , she said			1
meaning : the range of signs can have quite complex meanings , from desperation to shame			2
here , @entity4 seems to be pinching his lips , telling someone to stop talking talking with hands : the only thing that separates hand gestures from sign language is that they are used individually no one knows for certain why the system of gestures developed			1
one theory is that @entity10 developed them as an secret language of communication during centuries of foreign occupation — by @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 in the 14th through 19th centuries , professor @entity51 said			2
and in busy cities like @entity24 , gesturing was a way of marking one ’s territory			1
‘ to get attention , people gestured and used their whole bodies , ’ she added			0
recognisable : some of the signs are easy to decipher			0
here , the @entity10 minister for integration @entity114 is raising her hand to stop someone mid-speech salute : @entity120 deputy governor @entity119 gestures during a meeting			2
the hand movements developed from a time when people gestured with their whole bodies hand gesturing appears to be an ancient phenomenon			0
gestures used by the figures painted on ancient @entity130 vases found in the @entity24 area can be easily compared to those used by today ’s @entity133			1
@entity10 writer @entity134 wrote in a letter to his wife from @entity137 in 1901			0
‘ it seems that in this country , i ’m actually a laughing stock on account of my way of gesturing ... @entity143 in pockets - only then can you speak @entity146			0

gestures originated in @entity24 are now internationally recognised
complex system of gestures began in 14th century to mark territory
