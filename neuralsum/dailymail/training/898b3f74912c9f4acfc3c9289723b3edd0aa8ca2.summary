artist @entity0 has gone nuts for the @entity2 and carved five faces of @entity5 football legends on a handful of @entity7			1
armed with a scalpel , a magnifying glass and a 99p bag of @entity7 , he spent around four days on each one to perfect his portraits of @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and current @entity18 star @entity17			1
line - up : ( @entity20 ) @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity13 , @entity16 and @entity17 appear as nuts pick them out : the @entity24 nuts were carved by micro artists @entity0 meet you there : @entity17 is already out in @entity28 ahead of @entity18 's @entity2 training camp he said he worked through more than 50 nuts in the challenge , set by tv channel @entity33 to celebrate its @entity2 coverage , before he got it right			1
he said : ' when @entity33 asked me to carve the faces of five of @entity18 ’s most loved football legends out of @entity24 nuts i knew it would be a challenge			0
' the nuts can be very oily and extremely brittle but i think i managed to successfully capture the essence of each these football heroes			0
miniscule : @entity0 carved the nuts to launch @entity33 's @entity2 television coverage @entity2 heroes : @entity14 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) at the @entity2 in @entity49 in 1990 ' my final piece , @entity13 , proved to be a tough nut to crack with his large ear span reducing the already tiny surface area i had to work with			2
after over 20 attempts , many broken ears and all hope lost , i finally perfected it			0
' on another note , i know @entity33 is a comedy channel , but an @entity61 man carving @entity5 footballers into @entity24 nuts is a real joke is n’t it ? ' the channel is showing a succession of shows around @entity24 2014 including specials on @entity18 ’s football heroes , its best goals and its worst gaffes			2
