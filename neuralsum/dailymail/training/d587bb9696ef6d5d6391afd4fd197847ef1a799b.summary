when @entity1 decided to pull her music off @entity3 earlier this month she said she was unhappy that listeners could stream her songs for free			2
yet based on the number of streams that her massive hit @entity10 enjoyed during the month of october , @entity3 will have paid out somewhere between $ 280,000 and $ 390,000 in royalties for that one song alone			1
the popular music streaming service has repeatedly come in for criticism from musicians who claim that it does n’t pay them enough for their craft			0
@entity1 's hit @entity10 was the most streamed song on @entity3 during october , but so far this year @entity19 takes the accolade for his song summer which has been streamed more than 203 million times in the wake of @entity1 ’s departure , the company ’s ceo @entity23 was quick to point out that @entity3 had paid more than $ 2 billion to music labels and publishers since 2008 , while illegal downloads do n’t provide any revenue for artists			1
but @entity1 did n’t sound convinced when she spoke to @entity32 about her decision			0
‘ i think there should be an inherent value placed on art. i did n’t see that happening , perception-wise , when i put my music on @entity3 , ’ she said			0

those figures cover payments to labels , publishers and distributors , who then pass them on to artists and songwriters			1
shake it off , the first single from @entity1 ’s latest album 1989 , amassed an astounding 43.6 million plays on @entity3 during october which means the singer - who co-wrote the song with producers @entity62 and @entity64 - will be entitled to a large share of the estimated $ 390,000 in revenue it has generated			1
@entity1 pulled @entity68 if off from the service after only seven weeks and by doing so will actually loose out on a lot of additional revenue			0
