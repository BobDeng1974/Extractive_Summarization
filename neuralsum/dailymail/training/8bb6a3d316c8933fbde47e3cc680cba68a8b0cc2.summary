@entity1 chairman @entity0 held surprise clear - the - air talks with @entity5 president @entity4 in @entity6 this week			1
the two are understood to have had a convivial private conversation for about 45 minutes at @entity5 headquarters , where @entity0 was attending a gathering of the governing body ’s fair play and social responsibility committee			1
@entity0 had a private meeting with @entity5 president @entity4 in @entity6 such a meeting had seemed highly unlikely			1
in june @entity4 accused @entity17 media of ‘ racism ’ for demanding an investigation into allegations of corruption over @entity24 ’s @entity23 bid			1
@entity0 said the comments were ‘ offensive and completely unacceptable ’ and that the @entity5 chief should ‘ stop attacking the messenger ’			1
@entity0 has since made clear his distaste for @entity5 and instead has concentrated on building relationships with @entity30 — until wednesday ’s meeting instigated by @entity4 ’s @entity17 advisor			1
meanwhile , @entity34 ’s @entity33 , @entity5 vice-president for @entity35 , has emerged as a possible candidate to stand against @entity4 for the presidency			1
@entity30 , who want a credible rival to emerge from somewhere in the world , would certainly consider supporting an @entity42 bid			0
@entity44 ’s book - tour jibes about former players who propagate a @entity50 - style ‘ @entity47 - land with f * * * * * * @entity49 running around ’ have been given extra mileage by former captain @entity52			1
a paid @entity47 ambassador , @entity52 ( right ) is among the old boys @entity44 ridicules for their ‘ propaganda ’			1
@entity52 asked a @entity57 forum in @entity58 : ‘ is it necessary ? if you are going to come out with a book , why not talk about what you have done in the game , the good things , rather than criticise people when there is no need ? ’ but he conveniently ignored the fact that former @entity47 manager sir @entity69 had been just as critical about @entity44 — and others — in his own best - sellers			1
chairman @entity72 missed the end of @entity75 's 6 - 0 demolition of @entity76 when @entity75 chairman @entity72 failed to return after leaving the directors ’ box during tuesday ’s @entity83 match against @entity76 , many suspected he had been summoned to arrange the exit of marginalised chief executive @entity78			1
in fact , @entity72 had prearranged to talk to @entity86 @entity85			0
in any case , @entity75 insist @entity78 made his own decision to leave , despite being due to represent the club at a conference in @entity91 next month			0
@entity93 barb stings @entity94 @entity95 have paid the best part of £ 1billion for the @entity83 next season			0
so they will not be impressed with @entity93 , one of their star presenters , slating the tournament			0
@entity93 ’s numerous tweets included : ‘ would n’t bother me so much if tv did n’t treat @entity83 like some elite night			2
this bulls * * * is just like the early rounds of @entity106 ... it ’s got like @entity108 where any nutcase can join in … might as well let @entity110 into the precious @entity83 next year			2
’ @entity112 ’ reputation as a rugby - obsessed nation is not reflected in current ticket sales for the @entity116			2
record demand has seen 23 out of 48 games sold out , but seats are still available for all eight matches at @entity122 ’s @entity121			0
@entity125 ’s upcoming £ 10million lottery - funded campaign to persuade more women to enjoy sport , revealed by @entity128 on thursday , may seem excessive			2
but there is work to be done			0
a study puts the @entity17 in third place in the list of males under 24 active in sport across @entity136			0
however , in the female table the @entity17 sits in 19th place			0
@entity139 cool @entity141 fever hopes for an @entity139 franchise at @entity141 have been raised , with departing @entity1 general secretary @entity144 calling it a priority and chancellor @entity147 promising tax breaks			2
but the @entity139 will not be bounced into taking a permanent home at @entity141			0
they want more trials , including testing support with back - to - back matches next year when it is expected there will be no increase on three matches over here			0
the @entity139 , whose @entity141 agreement expires in 2016 , will also examine other @entity160 options before committing to @entity141 .			0

@entity1 chairman @entity0 met @entity5 president @entity4 in @entity6
the pair had a 45 - minute private conversation at @entity165
@entity44 ’s book - tour jibes given extra mileage by @entity52
