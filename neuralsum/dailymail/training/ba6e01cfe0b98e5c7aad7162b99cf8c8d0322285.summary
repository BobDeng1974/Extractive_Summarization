@entity0 refused to comment on his @entity2 future on @entity3 on saturday night			1
the @entity5 midfielder , who is currently being treated for an unspecified injury ahead of the @entity7 , joined former @entity9 presenter @entity8 in @entity10 in the build - up to the @entity13 final			1
and when asked where he was going to be playing next season , @entity0 was vague in his response			1
no comment : @entity0 failed to respond when asked where he would be playing next season late birthday present ! @entity8 presented @entity0 with this cake while on the @entity3 programme asked by keys if @entity2 fans could expect to see him in their sky blue colours next season , @entity0 replied : ' that ’s a good question			1
i think , to be honest with you now , there ’s been a couple of rumours , a couple of things going out , but as a player you always want to focus and keep calm			0
' as well as that , the fact that the fans look up to you and the people love you , they always want to question you and they always want an answer from you , but for my part i have come to @entity41 to try and recover from an injury and to prepare myself for the @entity7			1
' after the @entity7 i will make a statement but there is a lot of things in the media and as a player that ’s sometimes difficult and i have to manage that			1
the @entity7 is very important for my country and i need to focus on that			2
' keys tweeted : ' we know how to look after a guy			0
no encouragement for @entity59 tho			0
he would n't say he 's staying			0
' @entity0 was presented with a cake during his time on the station , ironic in the fact his future was thrown into doubt after not receiving a birthday treat at @entity2			1
ambition : toure has been linked with a return ' home ' to @entity71 after a lack of respect from @entity2 comments : @entity0 's agent @entity75 has been in the public eye over the last week @entity75 later clarified his remarks , saying that @entity0 was disappointed nobody from a senior position at the club wished him happy birthday			2
and on thursday he added : ' of course some players congratulated him ( on his birthday ) but not the sporting director , not the general director , not the chairman , nobody			0
' ( the manager ? ) no , nobody			0
snub : toure was upset by @entity90 not giving him a birthday message slice it up : the controversial cake his agent @entity94 insisted the midfielder was upset over the lack of respect , and the 31 - year - old backed up his claims			0
but a video published by @entity2 in which @entity0 was presented with a birthday cake has since been widely circulated while many also pointed out that the club had tweeted a happy birthday message at the time			2
