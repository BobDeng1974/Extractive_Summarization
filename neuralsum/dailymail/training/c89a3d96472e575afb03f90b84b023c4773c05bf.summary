by @entity0 published : 01:13 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 14 may 2013 it is one of the most highly - discussed and tested @entity4 pictures - and now it will go under the hammer for at least £ 1,000,000			1
the @entity8 painting of the @entity9 , which is considered to be one of @entity12 's masterpieces and believed to be a prototype for the @entity14 , will be sold in the first online auction of its kind			1
it has been the subject of 30 years of scrutiny and research by experts keen to discover the artist behind the intricate work and whether it was the model for the @entity14			1
the ' de @entity24 ' painting , which depicts the central figures of the @entity4 master 's famed @entity14 it began to attract attention after an art collector snapped it up in a house sale where it had hung over a fireplace			1
mrs @entity34 of @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , hung the @entity24 above the open fireplace in her bedroom			2
the painting was known to have existed in the @entity42 art collection for generations			2
after her death in 1981 , collector @entity46 bought the masterpiece at auction in the december of that year , the official @entity45 website said			1
the history behind it is rich and involves royalty and debt			2
an infra - red examination of the painting 's reverse flap of canvas revealed a monogram similar to the personal monogram of @entity61			2
sir @entity62 was @entity63 and receiver general to @entity61 from 1629 to 1649 and responsible for settling her art collection accounts , many of which were given to her by the @entity69 to bolster her catholic faith			0
it is understood that the queen owed money to sir @entity62 after he made her a substantial loan and the @entity24 was given to pay off the outstanding debt - or it was presented to him as a gift to him from the @entity69 for his services			0
the two figures are practically identical and the original has undergone intensive research and tests it is believed that it was passed down until it reached his distant relative , mrs @entity88			1
since then it has undergone countless tests to try and substantiate the theory that it was painted by @entity12			1
professor @entity92 from the @entity93 , who carried out an extensive examination on the materials used in the painting			0
he said : ' in september 2004 i undertook @entity100 spectroscopic analysis of paint samples from the @entity103 's tondo painting of the @entity9			0
' the analysis found clear evidence of the use of the yellow ( lead monoxide , @entity109 ) pigment massicot			0
this pigment is considered to be in pre- 17th century usage by artists			0
' the presence of lead white was also registered in the analysis			0
' the analysis also indicated that the medium was not an oil or resin nor made from gum , animal glue or egg white			0
it is therefore most likely to be of a vegetable - derived , starch based glue ( considered to be typical of @entity4 practice )			1
' from these analytical findings , i am entirely confident that the @entity24 painting is consistent with an early , pre- 1700 , @entity4 work			1
' the complete @entity14 is recognised throughout the world - and now a painting believed to be its prototype is up for auction further tests show that the drawing has been made with similar techniques to @entity12			1
the website said : ' x-ray analysis shows pounce - marks exclusively across the knuckles and around the fingers of the @entity9 's right hand and around the upper bicep of the child			0
' this indicates use of an auxiliary cartoon – a technique peculiar to @entity12			2
' the pentimenti - underdrawing - and details of both the @entity103 and the @entity14 are practically identical , adding weight to the the theory that it was a blueprint for the latter picture			0
potential buyers have until june 21 at 5pm to put in their bid - with offers opening at £ 1,000,000 .			0
