a ballet dancer is on target to waltz his way to fame with a series of gravity - defying photographs which could well be the ultimate self portraits			2
tourists wandering through the cobbled streets of @entity8 would stand in awe as they saw @entity10 performing his dance routines ranging from ballet to more modern moves			1
snapping away with their cameras as @entity16 performed pirouettes through the air , old and young alike would then share their magical pictures with the dancer			2
@entity10 seemingly floats through the air as he chats to a woman while people enjoy a picnic in the background , @entity26 , who now lives in @entity27 , said seeing the snaps inspired him to start his own project , enabling him to marry his love of dance with photography using a variety of locations as a backdrop			1
' tourists would quite often photograph and film me dancing in @entity8 , and after seeing the pictures they 'd taken of me , i figured that i should try it out for myself , ' said @entity26			1
after wandering around the @entity42 art gallery in @entity8 for inspiration , @entity26 bought a camera of his own and pored over the manual until he knew exactly how to use all the features and time his dance moves to coincide with the shutter speed			1
poised as if to pick a flower , @entity26 strikes a pose mid-air over the past three years , he has collected an assortment of snaps which show him dancing through the air for his 365 photo project			2
i ’ve spent three years working on this 365 photo project and it will probably take another three years to finish it , ' he added			0
uploading the photographs onto his website , viewers will be able to see @entity26 almost floating through the air on a beach , beside a hotel and in woodland			0
the 30 - year - old said he puts a lot of thought into the location of his photographs with some of the snaps taking minutes to shoot and others much longer			1
' i pick out a location , and then i set - up my tripod and i have a remote control that i press , ' he said			2
' of course , i also adjust photographic settings such as the aperture , but the tripod and the remote control is how i manage to photograph myself			0
' taking a picture can take anywhere from five minutes to an hour			0
sometimes i get lucky and have lots of time to take a picture , but sometimes i have constraints and no time at all , for instance if the sunlight changes or the other people in the picture ca n't stay			0
' @entity26 said that while it looks like there is just him at a particular spot , there is usually a throng of people behind the camera			0
' passers - by often stop and ask what i 'm doing or even take pictures of me taking pictures of myself , ' said @entity26			1
' i 've had groups of 50 people cheer me on as i take a picture , which kind of feels like a sports match , but with dancing ! ' in a scene which could have come straight from a science fiction film , @entity26 floats through a woodland @entity26 said that while the self - portraits are a hobby , he does occasionally sell them as well			1
' eleven of my pictures are currently hanging up at a bar in @entity27 , the @entity111 , @entity112 93 , ' he said			0
' this project is very personal to me , but i 'm always glad if people enjoy my pictures			0
i used to work in marketing in @entity8 , but now i 'm based in @entity27 and working as a photographer 's assistant to get some more experience			1
' i began dancing when i was 18 and i actually like anything to do with exercise and will do stretching most days			1
' @entity26 , who said his dream job would be to work as a fashion or commercial photographer , said children watching him dancing and taking photographs often tried to copy him			0
' when i 'm doing the splits , i often see little children trying to do them as well - it 's really cute , ' he added			0
anyone who would like to see more of @entity10 's work can do so at www.facebook.com/mickaeljouphotographydance or @entity134 using a piece of material , @entity26 demonstrates his athletic prowess and near weightlessness on a bridge a mirror helps create the illusion of air travel as @entity26 strikes a pose a move which is familiar to ballet fans everywhere , @entity26 gives it a special twist by performing it near the sea going outside to stretch your legs takes on a whole new meaning when you 're @entity10 @entity26 stands out from the crowds above as he poses among some wood tripping the light fantastic under the watchful eye of a woman on the balcony above			2
