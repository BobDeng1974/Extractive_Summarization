since being held in jail , the 19 - year - old from @entity36 has been keeping her 15 - day old baby , @entity21 , with her in the crowded cell in @entity4 's @entity30			1

' as she waited in the cell , nervously puffing on a cigarette , @entity24 added that she and her co-accused boyfriend were married ' in spirit '			2
she said : ' he has made us a ring each to wear from his side of the prison			0
she held up a hand revealing a red plastic ring			0
' @entity81 is blue , ' she added			0
it will now be up to the defence team to try to get the sentence reduced , or even thrown out			0
the court will resume next week when the defence begins its case			1
jail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime			1
a teary @entity24 hears the prosecution case today and her and @entity7 's defence lawyers will begin their arguments to have the sentence reduced - or the case thrown out - next week the 19 - year - old from @entity36 looks glum and downbeat as she cradles baby @entity21 in a holding cell @entity7 , 21 , bows his head in the dock - he has admitted killing his girlfriend 's 62 - year - old mother , battering her to death with the metal handle from a heavy fruit bowl the 21 - year - old gazes at his baby daughter , held by a relative , before his sentence demand hearing @entity7 was spotted gently holding his baby daughter , @entity21 , for the first time today in his holding cell @entity24 has said she never wanted her mother to die , but ' panicked ' after her boyfriend attacked her in the hotel @entity24 looked protective of her young daughter as she was greeted by a scrum of photographers at court @entity24 claimed her daughter - who had to return to hospital shortly after her birth with jaundice - has six fingers on her left hand dressed in matching orange waistcoats , the couple are escorted by a court officer to the courtroom @entity7 has admitted hitting the victim with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self - defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase , which was then loaded into the boot of a taxi they had ordered			1
the couple did not board the taxi , however , instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit			0
they tried to leave @entity4 through the airport but they did not have their passports , which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel - and @entity24 was allegedly the only person who had permission to open the box			1
