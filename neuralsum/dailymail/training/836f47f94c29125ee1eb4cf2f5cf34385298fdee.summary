figures released by the @entity14 watchdog revealed that the @entity2 union , led by far - left firebrand @entity3 , was again @entity5 ’s biggest donor , contributing £ 772,195 between april and june			1
in total , the unions gave @entity5 more than £ 2.4million in the second quarter , out of a total of just over £ 3million , which included lump sums of £ 485,830 from the @entity19 and £ 458,080 from @entity20			1
@entity5 ’s reliance on union cash is particularly stark since the figures also show that @entity5 is in a staggering amount of debt , with outstanding loans of £ 12.8million , compared with £ 2.6million for the @entity27			1
the party was forced to increase its overdraft facilities by £ 2.4million earlier this year with the troubled @entity30			2
among the @entity32 donations was a controversial £ 117,300 from @entity33 , an oil and gas company promoting offshore windfarms			1
in may last year the company ’s subsidiary @entity37 won a £ 640,000 contract from the @entity39 to build the foundations for offshore wind farms			0
the @entity27 topped the donations list and raked in a little over £ 4million in the same period , compared with £ 801,000 for the @entity44			0
but in another sign of the shifting sands in @entity48 politics , donations to the @entity48 @entity50 doubled between the first and second quarters of the year from £ 74,000 to £ 153,000			0
that included £ 50,000 from businessman @entity53 and regular donations from long - time supporter @entity55 , the spread betting magnate			0

@entity7 's dependence on the unions to fund his election war chest highlights the gamble he has taken by pledging to change the financial link with the unions mr @entity7 ’s dependence on the unions to fund his election war chest highlights the gamble he has taken by pledging to change the financial link with the unions , ending automatic payments from union members to the party			1
the @entity77 gave the @entity44 donations totalling £ 65,000 just weeks before the nightclub ’s boss @entity79 accepted a peerage			2
the company made a donation of £ 50,000 to the central party on june 6 , and on june 30 a further £ 15,000 was given to the @entity86 and @entity87 local association of @entity44 deputy leader @entity88			2

news of the donation was pounced on by @entity5 last night as an example of the @entity44 ’ hypocrisy			2
@entity100 mp said : ‘ @entity95 pledged before the election to “ take the big money out of politics ”			0
now we know he meant he wanted to put his biggest donors in the @entity94			0
’ last night a spokesman for the @entity44 said : ‘ @entity79 is a long - time supporter and donor			0
it should surprise no one that he continues to support the @entity44 ’ aims			0
’ @entity32 chairman @entity111 said : ‘ despite @entity7 ’s promise of change , these independent figures prove his @entity5 is still dominated by the trade unions			1
they choose the candidates , pick the leader and remain @entity5 ’s biggest donors , providing three - quarters of the party ’s money			2
‘ until @entity7 stops taking his union paymasters ’ cash , he will be too weak to stand up for hard - working people			0
instead , he can only offer what the union barons want in return for their money : the same old @entity5 policy of more spending , more borrowing and more debt , exactly what got us into this mess in the first place			1
’ the largest donations to the @entity32 were £ 280,770 and £ 263,600 respectively from party co-treasurers @entity138 , a hedge fund manager , and @entity140 , an investment banker			0
@entity5 released figures showing the @entity27 had been given £ 1million from donors who attended private dinners with @entity144 and other senior ministers			1

shadow justice secretary @entity149 said : ‘ the @entity27 have raked in over £ 1million from private dinners with @entity144 and senior ministers in the last quarter			2
and more than two thirds of that comes from the @entity153 – the bankers and hedge fund bosses whose taxes @entity144 cut			0
