more than 3,000 @entity47 and merchant seamen died between 1941 and 1945 on the convoys			2
only about 200 veterans are still alive			0
the very first @entity17 was awarded to commander @entity50 , 93 , who has battled tirelessly for 16 years for the convoy heroes to be recognised			1
he received his award from general sir @entity53 , the head of the @entity54 , at a special ceremony in his home city of @entity57 because of illness			1
@entity59 , released from hospital three weeks ago after suffering a heart attack , was too poorly to attend the main ceremony with 41 comrades in @entity37			1
heroes : pictured in their youths are @entity67 lieutenant commander @entity28 , ( left ) who served on 16 arctic convoy missions , surviving on a daily diet of a single piece of bread and corned beef , and @entity26 , one of the leading veterans in the campaign to award the @entity6 seamen a medal but he received a letter of congratulations from the prime minister , who announced in december that the @entity17 would be awarded , along with the new @entity80			1
it praised @entity59 ’s campaign and the ‘ extraordinary bravery and fortitude of a very special group of men ’			2
victory for campaign : the @entity44 in december last year @entity59 , who survived ten minutes in the icy @entity90 waters before he was rescued after his ship @entity92 was bombed in may 1942 , said : ‘ it is absolutely wonderful			2
we deserve this but it has been a frustrating battle against bureaucratic injustice			0
‘ it is sad that so many of my comrades are not alive today to receive their medals			0
’ sir @entity19 , the @entity101 , asked to personally present @entity59 ’s medal ‘ on behalf of the nation ’			1
he said : ‘ it ’s a very , very special day for all of us in the @entity54 , but especially for a small group who are still with us who did some very special things way back in the @entity31			1
‘ it ’s hard to comprehend what you and your comrades did battling against an enemy intent on your destruction			0
‘ what @entity50 and his comrades did was to ensure @entity119 could stay in the war at a very , very difficult time			1
if they had been beaten by the @entity122 then probably we would have been beaten			0
‘ so a small group of people played a vital role in something as massive as winning the war			0
’ the @entity6 were perilous missions to keep @entity119 supply lines open			1

in total , 87 merchant ships and 18 @entity157 warships were sunk			0
but the @entity159 meant it was politically difficult to give the survivors a medal for assisting the @entity162 and it is only now that the @entity6 veterans have been properly recognised			1
mr @entity19 ordered the medals amid concerns many veterans would die before they were awarded			2
hosting a special ceremony in @entity36 , he told the survivors : ‘ i am only sorry that it has taken 70 years to get to here and to say thank you for what you did			2
‘ you were involved in the most important struggle of the last 100 years when you were supplying one of our allies in the battle to defeat @entity177 and to defeat fascism in @entity179			0
' you are a group of heroes			0

‘ i am not a hero , i am a survivor but the guys who went up there they really had it rough and a lot of them did n’t come back			0

i honestly did n’t think it would happen			0
‘ he ’s in ill - health , he has only been out of hospital for three weeks now , he had been in since last october and there were two weeks when we thought he would n’t make it			2
‘ he had two cardiac arrests where they brought him back to life and then there was the heart attack			0
he certainly is a fighter and i do not think he ’s stopped grinning since he got that thing ( @entity17 ) in his hand			0
