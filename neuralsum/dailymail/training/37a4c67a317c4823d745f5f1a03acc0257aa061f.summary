by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 05:38 est , 22 august 2012 hundreds of barges are today stranded by low water on the @entity3 near @entity4 , @entity3 , after the @entity5 closed an 11 - mile stretch of the drought - parched waterway for dredging and to replace missing navigation buoys			1
the worst @entity11 drought in 56 years has left the river there at its lowest point since 1988 , a year when a similarly dire drought also stalled commercial traffic on the major shipping waterway			1
a lack of rain in the area in recent months has reduced water levels , exposing sandbars that experts warn could be deadly quicksand			1
however , 97 vessels were yesterday stranded by low water in the region unsafe : a lowering river allowssand bars to emerge in the @entity3 near @entity4			1
experts have warned that these could be deadly quicksand waiting it out : hundreds of barges are stuck north and south of @entity4 ( left ) , while the extent of the drought is clearly visible ( right ) the sandbars that are revealed look like beaches , inviting boaters , fishermen and hikers to venture out			1
experts agree that can be a very bad idea			2
@entity51 , emergency management chief for the @entity54 office in @entity55 , said the exposed sand looks dry on top but it is really saturated mud			2
combined with the undercurrent of water in the fast - moving rivers , that creates a true danger			1
mr @entity51 said : ' if it 's really wet sand and there 's flowing water underneath it , that 's what quicksand is			1
' the other issue is that as the river flows by it undercuts			2
you think you 're on a sandbar but you 're basically on a ledge			0
you put enough weight on it and you end up in the river			0
' dredging operations near @entity81 were halting river traffic for 12 hours at a time on monday as the @entity54 worked to keep a shipping lane wide enough and deep enough for commercial barge tows hauling everything from grain and fertiliser to steel and coal , industry sources said			2
shippers have been told for weeks to limit the amount of cargo loaded onto barges by at least 30 per cent so that they sit higher on the water , and to limit the number of barges in tows , but numerous vessels have still run aground up and down the river			1
vegetation accumulates in the sand bar in the middle of the @entity3 near @entity4			1
the worst drought in 56 years has left the river at its lowest point since 1988 exposed : a low watermark can be seen on the @entity3 bridge in @entity4 no other option : a barge and its towboat accumulates alongside the bank of the river at least three vessels , all with lighter - loaded cargo , ran aground in recent days between @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity55 , @entity117 , the @entity5 said			1
the various river shipping restrictions have reduced the flow of goods to and from @entity122 export terminals and driven up the cost of shipping as cargo volumes have declined but fuel and labour costs have not			2
some shipping lines have idled a portion of their barge fleets due to the currently unprofitable freight rates			0
@entity132 , senior agricultural economist at @entity133 , said : ' all of the grain export houses are impacted by the closures on the river and , when the river is open , by the reduced drafts			2
it drives up the costs of delivering grain to the port and it makes logistics a bit of a nightmare			0
' @entity147 freight rates were only marginally higher yesterday since only minimal volumes of grain were being shipped to @entity122 export terminals			0
but the upcoming @entity150 corn and soybean harvest could propel freight costs higher if river traffic remains severely restricted			0
the backup at @entity4 included 57 southbound vessels and 40 northbound vessels as of monday afternoon , said @entity157 petty officer @entity157 , adding that there was no timetable yet for reopening that stretch of the river			1
he said : ' there 's a @entity163 on scene surveying and remarking the channel ( with navigation buoys ) right now			0
' ongoing battle : a winch and a crane keep a dredging apparatus steady as it sucks up sand from the bottom of a navigation channel near @entity55 water is churned up at the end of a dredging pipeline connected to a @entity54 ' dredge parked up : at least three vessels , all with lighter - loaded cargo , ran aground in recent days between @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity55 hold - up : trucks and their loads accumulate alongside a grain processing operation the river was closed on friday , according to shipping industry sources , although navigation restrictions have been in place in the area since a vessel ran aground at the location on august 11			1
earlier this month , an 11 - year - old girl had to be rescued after sand swallowed her up to her waist while she and her family fished along the @entity3 near @entity194 in southeast @entity116			1
firefighter @entity195 said the girl began to sink and the more she struggled , the faster she descended			0
mr @entity195 and another firefighter found a slab of concrete debris to stabilise themselves , then had to dig the girl out by hand			0
she was scared but unharmed			0
he said : ' when you get to knee depth , you ca n't get out			0
it just starts sucking you down in it			0
it 's really like heavy goo			0
it looks dry on top but really it 's waterlogged			0
' lt @entity211 of the @entity5 said the best suggestion is to stay off sandbars			1
otherwise , he urged the use of lifejackets for anyone in or near the water .			2
