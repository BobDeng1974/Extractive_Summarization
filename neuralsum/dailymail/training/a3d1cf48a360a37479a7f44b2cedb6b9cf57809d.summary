by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ an unfamiliar scent of stability is wafting through the @entity5 air			0
following the bedlam of recent years , when a @entity9 's chicken was a surer bet to last longer than a @entity9 's football manager , @entity6 have now staggered into some stability with the forthright @entity13			1
appointed only 15 months ago in march 2013 , @entity13 is , incredibly , the eighth longest - serving manager in the @entity14			0
under @entity13 , the storm clouds engulfing this club have mellowed into a gentle breeze and for the first time in a long time , optimism abounds ahead of the season opener at home to @entity22 on friday evening			2
following this spirited draw against @entity24 , @entity6 remain undefeated in five pre-season games and they have not lost a football match since march , ending the last campaign with a 12 - match unbeaten run and falling only two points short of a play - off place			1
goal hero : @entity24 's @entity34 , pictured alongside @entity35 and @entity36 , got himself on the scoresheet striking for goal : @entity34 scored an equaliser for @entity24 against @entity6 at @entity40 @entity6 : @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 85 ) , @entity44 ( @entity45 70 ) , @entity46 , @entity47 ( @entity48 73 ) , @entity49 ( @entity50 87 ) , @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 76 ) , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 89 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 70 )			1

' now we have to try and improve again			0
the players here are not happy with finishing eighth			0
we want to do better			0
' against @entity24 , @entity6 , an organised and committed side , demonstrated why supporters are slowly but surely falling back in love with this football club			1
it was rovers that opened the scoring shortly before half - time , as @entity57 darted in front of @entity66 to glance a header past @entity62 in the @entity24 goal			1
in their anxiety to conform to @entity97 regulations , @entity6 's summer transfer window has brought only a small number of loan moves and free transfers			1
in @entity57 , however , @entity6 possess one of the most clinical strikers in the @entity104 game and his new contract may prove to be the most significant movement that @entity107 will make			1
@entity24 - despite being without a win in pre-season - are a patient and enterprising side under @entity112 and they gradually reasserted their foothold on the game , with @entity34 , signed from @entity114 , demonstrating his credentials once more with a fine strike from 25 yards that flew past @entity41 in the @entity6 goal			1
we will soon learn whether he can indeed hack a wet , windy night at the @entity123 but in the sunshine at @entity6 , the 23 - year - old - who once kept @entity120 out of the @entity114 team - was head and shoulders above all those on show			2
' he 's a quality player , ' @entity112 smiled			2
' it 's not just his finishing ability but his ability to pick a pass in tight spaces			2
even when there are a lot of bodies around him , he always seems to have time on the ball and that is a reflection of a great player			0
we will benefit from that , certainly			0

@entity24 summer signing @entity34 gets himself on the scoresheet at @entity40
@entity34 's goal cancelled out @entity6 striker @entity57 ' opener
@entity24 have two more pre-season *friendlies* before they take on @entity151
