so it ’s little wonder that when asked what he ’d do if he had a time machine , sir @entity7 ’s response was simple : ‘ go back and spend time with my mum			1
’ he made the touching reply in answer to a fan from @entity15 , whose question was picked from more than 10,000 submitted to his website in a new monthly feature			1
sir @entity7 ’s mother , @entity19 , was a midwife			1
she died at the age of 47 from an embolism , following surgery to treat breast cancer			1
sir @entity7 , her eldest son , was just 14			1
' i would spend time with mum ' : @entity7 , pictured left aged six , said he would go see his mother @entity19 , pictured right with his four - year - old brother @entity29 , if he had a time machine @entity31 : @entity7 mccartneysaid his mother inspired the hit @entity33 song @entity35 after appearing to him in a dream the 70 - year - old @entity33 has previously described how his mother inspired the song @entity35 , which he wrote after she appeared to him in a dream			1
he said @entity19 contributed ‘ a good half ’ to the family income			2
the @entity41 were too poor to have a car , but they ‘ just about had a television ’			0
he added : ‘ at night when she came home , she would cook , so we did n’t have a lot of time with each other			0
but she was just a very comforting presence in my life			0
' and when she died , one of the difficulties i had , as the years went by , was that i could n’t recall her face so easily			0
that ’s how it is for everyone , i think			0
' as each day goes by , you just ca n’t bring their face into your mind , you have to use photographs and reminders like that			0
' of the dream , he said : ‘ my mother appeared , and there was her face , completely clear , particularly her eyes , and she said to me very gently , very reassuringly : “ let it be ”			2

i woke up with a great feeling			0
it was really like she had visited me at this very difficult point in my life and gave me this message : be gentle , do n’t fight things , just try and go with the flow and it will all work out			0
‘ so , being a musician , i went right over to the piano and started writing a song : “ when i find myself in times of trouble , @entity19 comes to me … speaking words of wisdom , let it be			2
” ’ he added that he got together with @entity95 , his first wife , shortly afterwards , saying ‘ it was as if my mum had sent her ’			0
sir @entity7 continued : ' so those words are really very special to me , because not only did my mum come to me in a dream and reassure me with them at a very difficult time in my life - and sure enough , things did get better after that - but also , in putting them into a song , and recording it with the @entity33 , it became a comforting , healing statement for other people too			1
