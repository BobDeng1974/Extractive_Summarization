by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:13 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 06:32 est , 24 july 2013 he was born on monday afternoon , but it was n't until yesterday evening that we got the first glimpse of @entity6 , held by his proud parents @entity8 and @entity9			2
to us , he just looked like a scrunched up little ball of baby , but to them he is the most beautiful thing in the whole world , and no doubt they have spent their private time with him trying to see if he has @entity19 's nose , @entity21 ' eyes , @entity23 's ears and @entity25 's fingers			1
@entity26 has put together a family album of royal baby photos ... so who do you think the new addition most resembles ? spot the family resemblance ? @entity6 , left , the day after his birth , and the @entity19 at @entity34 in june , right the @entity35 with their new baby , the unnamed prince of @entity37 , who is only two days old but is already third in line to the @entity40 throne @entity19 and the @entity41 with sons @entity42 , right , prince @entity21 , centre back , @entity44 and daughter @entity45 in the garden at @entity47 , @entity48 @entity19 in 1929 ( left ) prince @entity41 as a toddler in 1922 ( right ) prince @entity21 in 1948 princess @entity45 in 1952 prince @entity42 in 1960 @entity44 in 1964 @entity50 in 1979 @entity51 in 1983 prince @entity9 in 1984 prince @entity52 in 1987 @entity53 in 1989 princess @entity54 in 1991 lady @entity55 in 2011 @entity56 , @entity57 in 2010 @entity6 was born on 22 july , 2013 , at 16.24 , weighing 8lbs 6oz			1
according to his father @entity9 : ' he 's a big boy , he 's quite heavy			0
' in fact , the not - so - little prince is the heaviest royal baby on record			0
so how do his relatives compare ? 1926 queen elizabeth : 2:20 am , no weight recorded1948 @entity21 : 9:14 pm , 7lbs 6 ounces1950 princess anne : 11:50 am , 6lbs even1960 prince @entity42 : 3:38 pm , 7lbs 3 ounces1964 prince edward : 8:20 pm , 5lbs 7 ounces1977 @entity50 : 10:46 am , 7lbs 9 ounces1981 @entity51 : 8:15 pm , 8lbs 1 ounce1982 prince @entity9 : 9:03 pm , 7lbs 1.5 ounces1984 prince @entity52 : 4:20 pm , 6lbs 14 ounces1988 princess beatrice : 8:18 pm , 6lbs 12 ounces1990 princess @entity54 : 7:58 pm , 7lb 1.5 ounces2003 @entity55 : 11:32 pm , 4lbs 9 ounces2007 @entity56 , @entity57 : 4:20 pm , 6lbs 2 ounces			0
