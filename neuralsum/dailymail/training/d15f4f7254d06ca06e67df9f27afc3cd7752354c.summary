take a good long look at @entity1 and @entity2 in action for @entity4 and enjoy them while you can			1
for it will be a miracle if they are still standing , let alone still playing in 18 months time , without some serious rest periods			0
a look at @entity4 ’s schedule in that time , particularly the nine - month period from the middle of april next year to the middle of the following january , is confirmation that the cricketing world has gone well and truly mad			2
there is so much international cricket , including an extraordinary 17 tests in that nine - month spell , that it will surely finish off @entity4 ’s big two fast bowlers and seriously shorten the careers of many an elite player to come			1
this is all about money			0
i have long believed that there is far too much international cricket , that the bottom line is pursued at the expense of the quality of the product			0
the concept of less is more , that every international match should mean something , is evidently lost on administrators obsessed with short - termism			0
now comes the tipping point			0
now comes a year , once the relatively low - key build - up to @entity50 is complete , which will jeopardise the longevity of players careers and undermine the quality and intensity of almost every @entity4 match			2
in january @entity4 undertake a triangular one - day series in @entity57 , also featuring @entity24 , before they begin the elongated @entity58 in february			1
as soon as that is over , at the end of march , @entity4 will be off to the @entity61 for a three @entity63 series before returning , via a one - day international in @entity65 , for an @entity67 summer which also features a @entity63 and one - day series against @entity69			1
had enough yet ? there ’s more , much more			0
as soon as the @entity67 , surely the priority of the whole lot , are contested and another one - day and @entity74 series against @entity57 is complete @entity4 will be off to the @entity75 to face @entity76 in a three - @entity63 series , plus the usual 50 - over and @entity74 matches , before a full tour of @entity79			1
and on it goes into early 2016 when there is a @entity74 tournament in @entity24 and beyond			0
mind games : @entity84 returned from the @entity67 tour after suffering a stress related illness who will be left standing ? @entity4 have been asked to play 17 test matches over the next nine months @entity91 @entity4 's @entity1 cleared for fourth test against @entity24 no rest for the cricket ! @entity4 's calender now you might point out that players are well paid these days and an inevitable consequence of the wages they demand is that there has to be a full itinerary to pay the bills			1
but a test every fortnight for nine months ? @entity4 playing virtually on every third day throughout the whole of 2015 ? crazy			2
it ’s impossible to know how much the demands of a life lived constantly out of a suitcase , with each pressurised match rapidly following another contributed to @entity84 ’s illness which forced him home from @entity57			1
but there is no doubt that the @entity114 are playing a dangerous game with the physical and mental well - being of their top players who , like @entity1 and @entity2 , simply will not be able to continue playing both @entity63 and one - day cricket			1
then there are spectators who pay big money to watch @entity4 and are entitled to expect to see the best players performing to the maximum of their ability			2
how often is that going to happen ? there are many reasons why there have been more empty seats at @entity4 matches this summer than usual but the sheer volume of expensive cricket has to be at the forefront of them			2
and , what ’s more , the power grab of the @entity136 by @entity24 , @entity4 and @entity57 will inevitably mean that those @entity138 spectators who pay top dollar will watch more and more matches against the old enemy @entity57 and @entity24			1
exhausted ! fans could miss the chance of seeing @entity4 stars like @entity1 if they are rested too much of a good thing ? the @entity67 will be contested for the third time in just over two years in 2015 familiarity will not only breed contempt , as we are seeing between @entity4 and @entity24 , but also indifference			1
the @entity67 are special because , like football @entity151 and rugby ’s @entity154 tours , they should not come around too often			0
yet next year will be the third @entity67 series in little more than two years			0
when will the magic disappear ? some time soon , surely			0
but do n’t worry because even when @entity4 are not playing @entity57 and @entity24 they will be playing someone else			1
too much of a good thing ? unquestionably			0
and hugely worrying for both players and supporters alike .			0

@entity4 have been asked to play 17 tests in the next nine months
schedule will put physical strain on players , especially pace bowlers @entity2 and @entity1
the mental strain can also trouble players as seen with @entity84
@entity4 must travel to @entity57 , the @entity58 , the @entity61 and a third ashes in just over two years
