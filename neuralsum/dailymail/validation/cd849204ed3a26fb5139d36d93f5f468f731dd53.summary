@entity0 insisted yesterday his party was ' here to stay ' as he predicted the @entity2 would defy the odds to serve a second term in government			1
despite consistently dismal poll ratings , the @entity2 leader claimed it would win more seats than forecast and could still hold office with fewer mps			1
attacking his conservative coalition partners , he compared @entity13 to ' @entity14 in a white tie ' and declared : ' @entity16 , dogs bark – and @entity18 cut			0
it 's in their dna			0
but he ruled out a formal coalition deal involving the @entity29 or @entity28			2
he went so far as to claim that only his party could stop a ' rag - tag mob ' of mps from @entity28 or the @entity29 from holding the balance of power after the election on may 7			1
the latest polls have consistently put the @entity2 on just 7 per cent , with experts predicting they will lose at least half the 57 seats they won at the last election			1
but , bizarrely , mr @entity0 compared their hopes for the future to last november 's landing of the @entity53 space probe on the surface of a comet			1
' what an audacious , optimistic thing to have ever dreamt of attempting , ' he said			0
speaking at the party 's spring conference in @entity25 , he added : ' i want us to take just a little bit of the spirit of that audacious project and to think big			0
' mr @entity0 , who appeared to have matched his pink tie with the bubblegum - pink dress worn by his wife @entity68 , watching from the front row , said his party would ' defy the odds and win this may '			1
he added : ' i have a message for all those who are writing us off again : the @entity2 are here to stay			2
i 've heard the predictions , i 've seen the polls			0
but let me tell you this : we will do so much better than anyone thinks			0
' however , his upbeat speech was overshadowed by an attack from left - winger @entity83 , who is thought to want his job			0
mr @entity83 , the @entity2 ' former president , said a second coalition with the @entity18 would tarnish the party 's reputation ' over the next generation '			2
he said he would give the party just two out of ten for its handling of coalition government			0
mr @entity0 , who appeared to have matched his pink tie with the bubblegum - pink dress worn by his wife @entity68 , watching from the front row , said his party would ' defy the odds and win this may ' wife @entity32 and women 's minister @entity99 listen to the keynote speech in @entity25 the deputy prime minister said : ' i have a message for all those who are writing us off again : the @entity2 are here to stay ' former leader @entity107 was unable to suppress a yawn as he watched mr @entity0 deliver his speech but former leader @entity107 said yesterday that mr @entity83 should keep his ambitions in check			1
@entity107 , who struggled to stifle a yawn during the conference , said of mr @entity83 : ' i think his well - known ambitions would be better served with a little more patience and a little more judgment			0
' @entity83 is a very able guy but judgment is not his strong suit			0
' @entity2 insiders firmly believe the party could be back in ministerial posts even if they emerge with as few as 30 seats on may 8			2
they expect the @entity18 to emerge as the largest party , and hope they will be within 30 seats of a majority – 326 seats – so the @entity2 can prop them up			2
mr @entity0 's 46 - year - old wife – a partner at a @entity34 law firm – does not get on stage to embrace her husband as other political wives do after their speeches			1
yesterday , it was mr @entity0 who came down the steps – as at previous conferences – and hugged her before they left to cheers from the party faithful .			1

mr @entity0 claims @entity2 will will more seats than forecast in may election
says his party can stop a ' rag - tag mob ' of mps from @entity28 or @entity149
