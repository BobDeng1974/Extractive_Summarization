by @entity0 to date we know of only one star in the universe that can host life : our sun. this has led astronomers to believe that stars similar to our own could host life , in addition to ones cooler than ours			2
but new research suggests we should n’t rule out hotter stars either , as they may also allow life to flourish			2
a new paper suggests that stars hotter than our sun might be able to host alien life			1
previously it was thought that the additional ultraviolet radiation would be detrimental , such as on an exoplanet closely orbiting a star ( pictured ) , but researchers say that is not necessarily the case there are various different types of stars classified as , from hottest to coolest , @entity28 , @entity29 , a , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , of which our @entity34 is a g - type star and sits in the middle of the ' main sequence ' on the @entity40 diagram			1
at the top end o and b stars are far too hot and live far too short lives of just a few million years to support the evolution and survival of life , considering life on @entity48 took half a billion years to establish itself			2
but f - type stars , while once thought to be inhospitable , could be prime candidates for habitability			1
f - type stars have a mass about 10 to 60 per cent more than our sun. this also gives them a surface temperature ranging from 5,800 to @entity58 ( 10,500 to 12,500 ° f ) – our @entity34 is just under 5,500 ° @entity59 )			1
they are also thought to remain stable for 2 to 4 billion years , which led the researchers to estimate there would be a sufficient window of opportunity for life to get a foothold			2
hotter , brighter stars ( top ) are thought to have larger habitable zones than our sun ( middle ) , although exactly how habitable they are remains to be determined			1
red dwarf stars ( bottom ) , meanwhile , which are dimmer than our sun , have a smaller habitable zone ‘ it has been argued that the most likely host candidates for exobiology should be k - type or even m - type stars based on their relatively long life spans and high frequency compared to the other types of main sequence stars , ’ paper co-author @entity77 , a professor of physics at the @entity79 , and lead scientist of the project , told @entity82			1
‘ but the only case known for life to exist is the environment of our sun , identified as a relatively hot and massive g - type star			1
‘ therefore , it appears to be fully appropriate to explore the possibility of exobiology for stars even hotter and more massive than the @entity34 ’ the researchers say that f - type stars are probably at the upper range of where life can survive			1
any hotter and the amount of ultraviolet radiation emitted destroys molecules like dna that are regarded as essential ingredients for life			2
the study suggests beings on a planet in orbit around an f - type star would receive up to 7.1 more radiation damage than we receive on @entity48			2
but an atmosphere or ocean could provide sufficient protection to allow the alien life to survive			0
this is a scatter graph used to classify stars in the universe			0
it was created in 1910 by @entity125 and @entity126			0
it shows the relationship of a star ’s magnitude ( how bright it appears to us ) and luminosity ( how bright it actually is ) to its temperature			0
as stars evolve they move to different points on the graph			0
based on stars we have observed , the graph shows us how a star will change over time			0
through the middle runs the ‘ @entity143 ’ of stars , upon which most stars begin			0
some will evolve into giants in the top right , while others will ultimately become white dwarfs in the bottom left			0
our sun will become a red giant in about 4 billion years			0
our sun is a g - type star and sits in the middle of what is known as the ' main - sequence ' of stars on the @entity40 diagram			1
the next ' level ' up in stars is f - type , which can be up to 60 per cent more massive then the sun and emit up to 7.1 times as much radiation in addition , increased ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation can provide the source of energy life needs to evolve			1
‘ broadly speaking , uv should be considered both a friend and a foe to the principal possibility of life , ’ @entity77 said			0
‘ at the present stage of @entity48 in regard to many of its life forms , the lack of an ozone layer would be truly harmful to most types of surface life			0
‘ on the other hand , in regard to life 's origin and early stages of evolution , a notable uv intensity could be important for facilitating the onset of life by triggering relevant early - stage biochemical reactions			0
’ another promising aspect of f - type stars is that they could have larger habitable zones , the regions around a star where liquid water can exist			1
this means that more planets in orbit around the stars have a chance to form water			0
however as f - type stars are rarer than smaller ones like our sun , their is less chance to study them in detail			1
nonetheless , the researchers conclude that astronomers should not limit their hunt for habitable planets to stars like our own , and should instead also consider some of these hotter stars .			2

researchers have said that stars hotter than our sun could support life
previously it was thought such f - type stars would be inhospitable
this is because they emit more harmful radiation onto *nearby* planets
but @entity77 and his team say the radiation could actually be *helpful*
it could stimulate evolution and the stars also have a bigger habitable zone
therefore we should not rule out larger stars in our search for life
