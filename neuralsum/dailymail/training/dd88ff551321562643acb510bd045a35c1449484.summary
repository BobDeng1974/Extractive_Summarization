by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 01:42 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 02:14 est , 9 december 2013 @entity3 returned sunday from a devastating injury to the @entity6 lineup after an eight month absence			1
mr @entity3 almost had a double - double , with nine points and eight rebounds in his season debut for the @entity6 , but the team fell 106 - 94 to the lowly @entity12			1
he began his 18th @entity15 season by going 2 for 9 with four assists and eight turnovers in 28 minutes			0
he 's back ! : @entity3 ( 24 ) drives to the basket against @entity12 shooting guard @entity19 ( 10 ) during the second half the sure - fire hall - of - famer had n't played since tearing his @entity22 in april and underwent months of rehabilitation to return for @entity25 ' 20th game this season			1
adoring fans cheered @entity3 's every move and forgave every misstep , but @entity3 could n't rally the @entity6 late despite another huge game by @entity25 ' reserves			1
the 35 - year - old perennial all - star had n't played since getting hurt in a home game against @entity34 on april 12 , making two free throws on a torn @entity22 before limping to the @entity37 locker room			1
he had immediate surgery , vowing to return close to full strength - and after working his way back into practices with the @entity6 in the last few weeks , he pronounced himself ready			1
the building had the buzz of a playoff game before the opening tip , with most fans in their seats with cameras trained on @entity3 during opening warmups			0
the building erupted in loud applause at every mention of @entity3 , who was introduced last in the starting lineup to the thunderous strains of ' @entity57 ' - @entity56 's theme from ' @entity58			2
' still an intense competitor : @entity3 reacts to a whistle shortly after turning over the ball in the second half the crowd roared again the first time mr @entity3 touched the ball , and he found @entity65 underneath the hoop for an assist on @entity25 ' first possession			0
with his wife , @entity70 , and two daughters sitting courtside , he hit a free throw for his first point in the second quarter , followed shortly by an 8 - foot , double - pump , left - handed bank shot for his first field goal			1
the @entity6 never led , and @entity12 improbably snapped its five - game losing streak despite playing without forward @entity81 , who is expected to be traded to @entity82 on monday as the centerpiece of an apparent seven - player deal			2
@entity85 had 23 points and eight assists , and @entity19 added 10 of his 26 points in the final 4:35 of the @entity12 ' first road win over the @entity6 in 11 tries since dec. 28 , 2001			2
his family came to support him : @entity92 , right , wife of @entity6 ' @entity3 , sits with their daughters @entity95 , left , and @entity96 , center , @entity98 scored 19 points for the @entity6 , who went 10 - 9 without mr @entity3 this season , forging a winning record without the five - time @entity15 champion and with little help from fellow injured former mvp point guard @entity106			1
@entity107 scored 17 points off the bench , and @entity110 added 14 for the @entity6			2
the @entity12 had 11 players available after holding out mr @entity81 , center @entity112 and forward @entity114 , all set to head to the @entity82 in exchange for @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			0
that turned out to be plenty , thanks to two @entity25 natives			0
@entity124 , who attended nearby @entity125 , went 14 for 17 and surpassed his previous career high early in the third quarter			0
mr @entity124 did n't take a shot in the fourth , but @entity130 product mr @entity19 and mr @entity85 held off the @entity6			0
mr @entity3 added a signature 22 - foot face - up jumper later in the period , but also showed clear signs of rust and unfamiliarity with his new teammates .			0

@entity3 played sunday for the first time since tearing his @entity22 in april
he scored eight points and had nine rebounds - almost a double - double
the @entity6 failed to win despite having their superstar player back
