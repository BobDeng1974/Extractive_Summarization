@entity7 pledged to @entity10 chapter in 2001

frat brothers were filmed singing about lynching on their way to a party
@entity7 said the fraternity he joined was not racist - and video shocked him
the @entity10 chapter has been shut down , and members *kicked* off of campus
university president is considering legal action against those responsible
