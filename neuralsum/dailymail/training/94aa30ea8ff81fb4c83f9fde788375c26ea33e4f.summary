by @entity0 published : 12:42 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:45 est , 20 february 2014 bankers have been accused of acting like pigs , snakes and rats			2
but scientists in @entity8 now believe they act more like teeth - baring monkeys			1
the researchers claim that primate social networks could provide valuable lessons that will help predict and prevent future financial crisis			2
the study at the @entity15 argues that captive rhesus macaque monkeys and bankers both take part in comprise complex networks			1
the study at the @entity15 argues that captive rhesus macaque monkeys ( left ) and bankers ( illustrated , right ) both take part in complex social networks that mirror each other researchers propose that crises are sometimes caused by breakdowns in these internal networks rather than by external factors			1
they argue that catastrophic collapses could be avoided by monitoring changes in these complex and often mysterious internal structures			0
‘ admittedly , comparing monkeys to a financial system is unconventional , however , we believe the comparison is compelling , ’ said @entity33 , a professor of statistics and the study ’s lead author			2
‘ we argue that it ’s possible to detect when a crisis is likely to set in - whether in a primate social group or an industry like banking - by modeling the evolution of the breakdowns across the system ’s networks , ’ said co-author @entity41			0
' there may not be much teeth - baring in the banking industry , however we did determine that interbank lending would be the network in that system that is of comparable importance to subordination signalling in a monkey colony , ' professor @entity50 said a chimpanzee in @entity61 has been shown to outperform 94 per cent of @entity61 's investment funds with her portfolio growing by three times in one year			1
several years ago , @entity65 reported how circus chimp @entity66 chose eight companies from a possible 30 to invest her one million roubles - around £ 21,000			0
the money-wise ape was given cubes representing different companies and asked : ' @entity66 where would you like to invest your money this year ? ' pausing briefing to think , she then picked out her eight cubes			0
@entity66 's top picks included banks where shares soon rose a stunning 600 per cent after large - scale support from the @entity80 to weather the crisis			0
she missed out on telecommunications which scored a 240 per cent profit , but went for mining companies , up 150 per cent			0
the researchers first examined the power structure and significant points , or nodes , that comprise the networks in the monkey social group and applied them to comparable networks in the banking industry			2
for example , the networks in a community of captive monkeys are based on behaviours such as mutual grooming , fighting , assisting in fights and displaying status signals such as teeth - baring			1
in the banking industry , the primary activities revolve around interbank lending , loan syndication , bond - issuing services and insurance			1
the researchers determined that the most important activities within each system are those that influence other relationships			0
in monkey society , for instance , teeth - baring and other status behaviour that signal who is the boss comprise the ‘ main network ’ because they govern close , long - term relationships and aggression between individual monkeys			1
‘ there may not be much teeth - baring in the banking industry , however we did determine that interbank lending would be the network in that system that is of comparable importance to subordination signalling in a monkey colony , ’ professor @entity50 said			1
these main networks are critically important because they significantly influence the stability of other relationships or networks within each respective system , she said			0
the researchers argue that by looking at changes in the connectivity patterns within the main network , it ’s possible to measure growing disturbances within the system , detect a mounting problem .			0

scientists say bankers act in some ways like rhesus macaque monkeys
researchers in @entity8 examined the power structure of both groups
monkeys use mutual grooming , fighting , and signals such as teeth - baring
bankers , meanwhile , assert status using interbank lending , loan syndication , bond - issuing services and insurance
