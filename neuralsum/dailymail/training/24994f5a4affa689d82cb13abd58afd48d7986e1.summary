by @entity0 last updated at 3:55 pm on 12th august 2011 perhaps it ’s just time to close the doomed thing forever			2
an amusement park in @entity5 last night again shut a rollercoaster from which an amputee @entity8 war veteran fell to his death last month			2
a chain snapped on the @entity12 & @entity14 's @entity13 , which stranded 32 riders near the top of one of the rollercoaster 's hills			1
tragic accident : @entity8 veteran sergeant @entity21 visited the theme park with several members of his family , including his two daughters everyone could walk down the side of the track safely and the ride remains closed , park officials said			1
army sergeant @entity21 , 29 , was riding the same ride on july 8 when he was lifted from his seat , thrown to the ground and died			1
operator error was to blame for the father - of - two ’s death from blunt force trauma and the park had improperly trained workers , state officials said			0
sergeant @entity21 , who was travelling at 50mph when he flew out of his seat , lost both of his legs to a roadside bomb in @entity8 in 2008			1
investigators said the ride was mechanically fine and safety devices were working properly but operators did not follow rules posted at the ride 's entrance , which require that riders have both legs			1
two violations : the theme park was cited for not properly training the ride 's operators and operators being unfamiliar with the coaster 's safety requirements reopened to the public : the ride of steel roller coaster reaches speeds in excess of 70mph and its highest peak is 208ft a seatbelt and metal bar restrain riders by the legs , shins and lap. but sergeant @entity21 was noy wearing his prosthetic legs when he shifted from his wheelchair into a front seat of the ride			1
this was n't the first serious accident on the @entity13 that first launched following a $ 12million improvement to the park in 1999			0
shortly after its grand opening , @entity84 , then 37 , of @entity85 , fell out of his seat 10ft to the ground as the ride was braking on its final approach near the station house			1
mr @entity84 suffered multiple rib fractures and internal injuries in the accident			0
@entity94 , the operator of the park at the time , had argued that the injuries resulted because @entity84 , who weighed more than 300lbs , was too large for the seat 's lap - restraint bar to engage			0
park officials later added safety belts			0
but a @entity101 jury found the park fully liable and awarded a $ 4million verdict to mr @entity84 , before the case was eventually settled for $ 2.85million			0
the @entity105 said @entity12 did not properly train the ride 's operators on the safety and operations restrictions and operators were unfamiliar with the coaster 's safety requirements			1
the ride , which had been closed since the accident , was re-opened on july 22 after operators received fresh training in safety procedures and clearer safety signs were posted			1
managers were told to review all safety restrictions on every ride before the start of each operator 's shift and there were due to be more random , unannounced audits to make sure rules are followed			2
' we were all devastated by this tragedy , and are committed to doing everything we can to prevent something like this from ever reoccurring , ' the park ’s general manager @entity128 said			0
thrill ride enthusiasts said at the time the accident did not deter them from riding the roller coaster			2
' stuff happens , ' said @entity139 , 30 , of @entity140 , who rode the coaster a few minutes after it reopened the first time			0
inspiring figure : sergeant @entity21 , pictured with charity workers , often spoke of his desire to stay active ' people get in car accidents all the time			1
they do n't stop driving cars			0
' @entity151 of @entity152 , who was in the first car along with his 11 - year - old daughter @entity154 , said : ' @entity155 tightened everything a little tighter			0
' he called the death ' a tragic and unfortunate accident			0
' sergeant @entity21 came out of his seat and its restraints on the last and second - highest of three hills on the coaster , which reaches speeds in excess of 70mph and whose highest peak is 208ft			1
the veteran struck the front of the eight - car train and fell about 150ft , landing on a grassy area			0
he was on the ride with his nephew , @entity174 , when the tragic accident happened .			2
