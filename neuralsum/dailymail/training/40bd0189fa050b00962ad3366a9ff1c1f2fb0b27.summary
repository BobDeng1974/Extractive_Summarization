@entity7 ' talent for impersonating his idol has taken him from @entity10 karaoke bars to the spiritual home of all @entity5 fans - @entity13			2
the 28 - year - old - who changed his surname by deed poll in honour of the rock and roll icon - travelled all the way to @entity21 , where he saw off competition from 250 other acts to be named the world 's best @entity7 impersonator			1
scroll down to watch the @entity26 ... career change : @entity7 , 28 , used to deliver beer barrels to pubs in his native @entity30 before he moved to the @entity31 and became a tribute artist judges at the contest praised mr @entity7 ' authentic walk and mannerisms as well as his singing voice			1
' the judges said when i walked on stage i was @entity7 , ' he said			0
' the way i walked and moved the microphone from hand to hand and my singing			0
' the only thing @entity46 - who is originally from @entity30 and now lives in bilston - struggles to emulate is @entity5 's famous southern drawl			2
' i am from @entity30 so my accent is obviously nothing like @entity7 , ' he said			2
' and the fact that i have lived in the @entity10 for four years means i have a @entity54 accent as well			0
' the tribute artist has come a long way from delivering beer barrels to pubs back home in @entity30 - his occupation before he moved to the @entity10 in 2008 to pursue singing full time			1

likeness : @entity7 has built up a repertoire of more than 350 @entity5 numbers - along with a wardrobe full of spangly jumpsuits ' @entity30 is a very small place and i wanted to sing @entity7 songs to a much wider audience , ' he said			1
' i knew the only way to do this full - time was to move to @entity68			0
' the work is very different in @entity30 - it 's a small island so my act would only really be for the tourists			0
i did karaoke and people were encouraging me			0
' a guy in a karaoke bar was saying i should impersonate @entity7 for a living and i thought , why not ? ' inspiration : pictured left , @entity5 on stage in @entity90 in 1973 , and pictured right , @entity7 on stage at @entity94 's @entity93 after arriving in the @entity68 mr @entity7 , who is engaged to fiancee @entity95 , entered a contest for @entity7 tribute acts in @entity98 , @entity99 , and won , spurring him on to continue impersonating his idol			1
