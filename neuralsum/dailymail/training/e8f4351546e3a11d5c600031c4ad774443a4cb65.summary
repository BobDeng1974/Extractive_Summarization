the former @entity9 football captain called rival player @entity10 a ‘ f * * * * * * black c * * * ’ and a ‘ f * * * * * * k * * * head ’ after @entity10 goaded him for sleeping with model @entity16 , it was alleged			1
@entity10 – brother of @entity21 star @entity19 – did not realise he had been racially insulted until he saw footage of the incident on @entity24 , @entity18 was told			0
evidence : @entity10 leaves the court yesterday with friends the incident came in front of 20,000 fans – as well as a tv audience of two million – in a clash between @entity3 ’s @entity27 and @entity10 ’s @entity56 on october 23 last year			1
the row began after @entity3 failed to return the ball to @entity56 during the last few minutes of a tense game at the latter team ’s ground in @entity62			2
annoyed , @entity10 began to make lewd ‘ fist - pumping ’ hand gestures at 31 - year - old @entity3			1
his opponent understood the gesture to ‘ refer to the well - publicised allegation ’ that he had had ‘ an extra-marital affair with a team - mate ’s wife ’ , prosecutor @entity65 said			0
in response , @entity3 began shouting at @entity10 , using a string of swear words , mr @entity65 said			1
the prosecutor added : ‘ the words were abusive and insulting in a straightforward sense			0
’ they were ‘ uttered as an abusive insult demonstrating hostility based on mr @entity10 ’s membership of a racial group ’			2
@entity10 said he had not heard the word ‘ black ’ – only swear words that he reacted to by raising the issue of @entity3 ’s affair			1
after the game , @entity3 called @entity10 to his team ’s changing room , where he is alleged to have said : ‘ it ’s handbags innit – it ’s what happens on the pitch			1
’ the pair shook hands but – after watching footage of the incident with his then girlfriend – @entity10 believed that @entity3 had made a racist comment and became ‘ livid ’ over what had happened			1
no special treatment : @entity3 was ordered to take his place in the dock after his lawyer asked if he could sit beside him in the dock : @entity3 watches on as his alleged race abuse victim @entity10 gives evidence in this artist 's impression of proceedings watching : @entity108 , mother of murdered teenager @entity109 , arrived at court yesterday with @entity10 's mother @entity111 when he was questioned by police over the incident , @entity3 admitted using a racist jibe but claimed he had said it ironically , believing @entity10 had just accused him of making that same remark			1
‘ whilst footballers are used to industrial language , saying racist terms is completely unacceptable whatever the situation , ’ he said			0
‘ i was completely taken aback by this remark as i have never been accused of something like that			0
’ the @entity9 defender added that he had not been offended by the taunts about his alleged affair , because ‘ it ’s not the first time i ’ve heard it , so it ’s with a pinch of salt ’			2
@entity3 , a married father of two who earns £ 160,000 a week , denies a racially aggravated public order offence , which carries a maximum fine of £ 2,500			1
fraternal affection : @entity136 tweeted support to his brother @entity138 ahead of the hearing more than 100 photographers and cameramen lined the entrance to the @entity143 awaiting his arrival yesterday morning			0
wearing a tailored grey suit and pink tie , he was bundled by his security team through a side door to avoid the huge crowd of press and public at the front of the court			0
scandal : @entity3 's alleged comments came in response to taunts by the other player about his alleged affair with an ex-team - mate 's girlfriend , @entity16 , pictured , the prosecution said at the start of the hearing , the @entity9 player asked if he could sit next to his barrister rather than in the dock			1
chief magistrate @entity168 rejected his request although he briefly permitted him to leave the dock so he could watch as footage of the incident was played to the court			0
giving evidence yesterday , @entity10 said : ‘ when someone brings your colour into it , it takes it to another level and it ’s very hurtful			0
’ but he said he had initially avoided giving a statement to police because he wanted the incident to be dealt with by officials at the @entity185			2
‘ this is a footballing issue that happened on the football pitch where we work , ’ he said			0
he denied a suggestion that he went to police only when persuaded to by his publicist @entity192 , who also works for @entity19			0
@entity10 said : ‘ no , i made up my own mind , i wanted to do it			0
’ the decision to investigate the former @entity9 captain was taken when police received a complaint from a member of the public after the @entity42 match			1
a lip reader gave evidence saying she had studied the footage and confirmed the use of the word ‘ black ’			2
@entity3 , whose @entity27 team won the @entity208 and the @entity209 in may , was part of the @entity9 side that reached the quarter finals of @entity213 last month			2
he was stripped of the national team ’s captaincy for a second time this february after the date for his race row trial was set			0
@entity10 has played for @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity56			2
his brother was @entity3 ’s former defensive partner in the national side			0
@entity108 , mother of murdered black teenager @entity224 , attended yesterday ’s hearing and sat in the public gallery			1
the trial , which is expected to last five days , continues			0
key moment : @entity3 and @entity56 's @entity10 clash during the @entity42 match at @entity231 tension : @entity3 and @entity10 will argue the question over five days this week trust in @entity3 : a fan shows his backing for the footballer by standing with an - almost - lifesize poster of the player outside the court sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			1
