by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 08:47 est , 18 march 2014 a man who dragged a cardboard cut - out of a policeman onto a petrol station forecourt and kicked it to pieces in full view of @entity8 has been fined £ 90			1
police tracked down the 23 - year - old after the bizarre attack at a @entity13 petrol station in @entity14 , @entity15 , where the two - dimensional officer was supposedly being used to deter shoplifters			1
they used his car numberplate to trace him to his home in nearby @entity22 and issued him with the fine for criminal damage			0
@entity25 : a 23 - year - old man has been fined for kicking a cardboard policeman similar to the one pictured crime fighters : the £ 100 cut - outs were introduced in a trial by @entity15 police in 2009 and scrapped the next year			1
some have since been reintroduced			0
pictured left : @entity36 @entity35 and sgt @entity37 ( file photo ) police viewed footage of the incident , which happened in broad daylight on march 1 , and attended the man 's home on tuesday last week where he admitted the attack			2
sgt @entity46 , from the @entity47 , said : ' this man obviously thought it would be funny to take this cut - out to the forecourt and kick it to pieces			1
@entity53 spent £ 760 on eight so - called ' cardboard cops ' for a trial in 2009 , where they were put at petrol stations to deter fuel thieves			1
the trial was abandoned a year later after the force admitted they were not having the desired effect - and some were being stolen			2
amid headlines the force removed the effigies from forecourts , shops and supermarkets			0
but the two - dimensional crime fighters were recently reintroduced at supermarkets and petrol stations around @entity22 , paid for jointly by @entity72 and @entity53			2
the destroyed cardboard policeman has not yet been replaced at the @entity13 petrol station			0
it is not the first bizarre crime at the @entity14 branch of @entity13			0
last august , a brazen thief stole a @entity81 children 's ride from outside the shop in broad daylight			0
' whatever he may have thought , this cutout was there for a reason			0
' we did manage to track down this man using @entity8 and he was dealt with by way of a £ 90 fine			2
' @entity53 would not name the man because he was not charged with a criminal offence			0
fixed penalty notices are used to punish low - level crime to avoid giving an offender a criminal record			0
for criminal damage cases , a fixed penalty notice can be given at an officer 's discretion if the value of the damage was less than £ 300 and the victim knows they will not receive compensation			0
@entity53 introduced the cardboard crime fighters in a 2009 trial supposedly to deter shoplifters			1
but some of the £ 100 life - size cut - outs became victims of crime themselves , being stolen by pranksters , youths or criminals			1
the official trial was scrapped in 2010 with police in @entity15 admitting the cardboard figures failed to reduce crime			1
but new cut - outs were funded recently by the local @entity47 , which works in partnership with the council			1
they have been used in several areas including @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , where the @entity129 force alone spent £ 13,260 in two years on 52 cutouts costing £ 255 each			0
@entity131 added : ' these cardboard cut - outs have received some bad press in the past			1
' we do not use them to replace officers , instead they are a tool that we use to deter shoplifters			2
' we have seen a reduction in shoplifting offences at the stores where these cut outs are located			0
' crime scene : the attack was caught on @entity8 at this @entity13 petrol station in @entity14 , @entity15 interest : two shoppers look at a cardboard cut - out after they were originally introduced in @entity15 ( file photo )			1

cardboard cut - out was ' kicked to pieces ' at @entity153 in @entity14 , @entity15
incident caught on @entity8 and man was traced through his numberplate
two - dimensional officers cost £ 100 and police claim they deter shoplifters
@entity15 trial of the cut - outs was scrapped in 2010 but they were reintroduced
