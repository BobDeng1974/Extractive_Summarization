a study has found that a quarter of teenagers in @entity3 have received explicit pictures on their cellphones almost four in ten teenagers in @entity3 have received explicit pictures on their cellphones , new research reveals today			1
the study , by the @entity11 , also found that a fifth of youngsters have also sent a nude picture of themselves to someone else on their smartphone			1
this has prompted researchers to warn that the practice could be more widespread in schools and colleges than first thought			1
and they added that although the survey took place in the @entity3 , experts believe that the findings are applicable in most western countries where smartphones are widely used			1
the study surveyed 1,130 undergraduate students about their experiences of sending x-rated snaps in high school			0
nearly 20 per cent reported they had sent a nude photo of themselves to another via cellphone while 38 per cent had received such a picture			1
of the number who had received one of these messages , nearly one in five had forwarded the picture to someone else			2
professor @entity46 , who conducted the study , said the risks of using a mobile phone to send intimate messages goes well beyond that of sharing print photographs as a form of flirting			2
he said : ' nothing has changed in that realm - except that the technology makes it easy and thus , more vulnerable to misuse			0
' you lose control of the image the moment you push send			0
' from there the risks , which can be especially grave for teens , range from embarrassment and humiliation to unwanted sexual advances to cyberbullying and blackmail , and though rare , possibly to felony charges for pornography trafficking because they are minors			2
' the research was published online in the journal computers in @entity75 and was conducted over a three - year period			0
participants were students enrolled in undergraduate psychology classes and queried about their experiences of sending explicit messages during high school - after 2007 , when it became more commonplace			2
though the research was completed at a single , public institution , a quarter of the students surveyed attended high school outside @entity85 , and seven per cent outside the @entity3 , providing a measure of economic and geographic diversity			1
the researchers have also warned that the practice of sending explicit pictures is more widespread in schools than first thought prof @entity46 added : ' sexting is far from a rare occurrence and the ability of a recipient to forward on a sext to others can be problematic , especially for young women who share an explicit photo			1
' because once a sext has been sent , the sender has no control over who , or how many , will eventually see that picture			0
other than the adolescent mentality that overestimates benefits over risks , we do nâ€™t yet know why teens are choosing to put themselves at risk			0
' the research also found that both men and women send explicit messages but significantly more males had received an initmate picture on their mobile phone			1
professor @entity46 concluded that there are still a number of important questions about teen sexting that need reliable answers before adults can decide how - or even if - they should respond to the popular phenomenon			0
he said further study is needed to better understand teen motives , get a clearer sense of their appreciation of possible consequences of sexting and whether sexting increases or decreases initiation of physical sexual interaction , among other issues .			0
