rules which mean the secret services , bomb disposal units and organ transplant deliveries have to stick to the speed limit are to be torn up			1
changes to motoring laws mean officers in @entity16 and @entity17 will be able to break speed limits when national security is at stake			1
law breaker : spies like @entity23 will be able to break the speed limit without falling foul of the police the idea of giving more people the same rights on the road as ‘ blue light ’ services like the police , ambulance and fire brigade was backed by 9 out of 10 of those who responded to a government consultation			1
under the move exemptions from having to stick to the speed limit will be expanded			2
but before spooks can put their foot down they will have to undergo a driver training course			0
it means scenes of @entity23 speeding through the streets of @entity48 and the @entity4 meant 007 was actually breaking the law			0
transport minister @entity50 is expected to give them the green light to speeding when the responses to the consultation have been considered			2
vehicles used to carry organs for transplant , bomb disposal units , and mountain rescue teams are also set to be added to the list			1
bomb disposal units will also be able to ignore speed limits when rushing to security incidents it is understood that 93 per cent of those who replied to the consultation on the issue backed extending the speeding exemption to those involved in ‘ the protection of life and limb or national security ’			1
the @entity74 said : ‘ the strongest support came from the @entity76 who gave their full backing to this proposal			0
‘ most of those that commented agreed that emergency response drivers must be appropriately trained for what can be extremely demanding circumstances			0
‘ it therefore made sense to regulate and prescribe high speed training to those who can demonstrate a need to be exempt from speed limits			0

ministers to allow @entity16 and @entity17 to speed if national security is at stake
bomb disposal , organ deliveries and mountain rescue also exempted
93 *%* of respondents to a government consultation back the move
