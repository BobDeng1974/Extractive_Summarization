@entity3 's controversial @entity2 advert has become the most complained about @entity5 advert of all time with more than 5,200 complaints so far , the @entity0 said today			1
the advert , which offered ' money back if he walks ' or @entity2 is found not guilty of killing his girlfriend @entity11 , is to be withdrawn with immediate effect after it received an ' unprecedented number of complaints '			1
an @entity0 spokesman said : ' we consider the ad may be seriously prejudicial to the general public on the ground of the likely further serious and / or widespread offence it may cause			1
upset : @entity3 's @entity2 advert has become the most complained about @entity5 advert of all time with more than 5,200 complaints so far pulled : the advert , shown here in its internet version , offered ' money back if he walks ' and is to be withdrawn with immediate effect after it received an ' unprecedented number of complaints ' ' we are also concerned that the good reputation of the advertising industry may be further damaged by continued publication of this ad			1
' the advert featured a photograph of @entity2 , a double amputee @entity39 racer and a @entity42 gold medallist , mocked up as an @entity44 statuette			1
it took the title of the most complained - about @entity5 ad of all time from @entity49 , whose 2005 campaign featuring call centre workers singing with their mouths full drew 1,671 complaints			1
the @entity0 had previously said it was investigating whether the advert was offensive for trivialising several issues , including the fact it is a murder trial , ms @entity11 ’s death and @entity2 ’s disability			1
prejudice : the @entity0 said the @entity2 advert could be seriously prejudicial to the general public probe : the @entity0 had previously said it was investigating whether the advert was offensive for trivialising several issues , including the fact it is a murder trial , ms @entity11 's death and @entity2 's disability on trial : @entity2 is surrounded by security personnel as he leaves the @entity70 this afternoon after the third day of his murder trial , in @entity72 a spokesman said that it was also looking at whether , in doing so , it brings the reputation of advertising into disrepute			1
@entity0 chairman @entity79 took the unusual step of directing the advertiser to withdraw the ad from circulation pending the outcome of the investigation , which had been fast tracked			1
only in exceptional circumstances do the watchdog ’s procedures under the @entity88 allow it to take interim action and have ads amended or withdrawn pending investigation			1
the national advertising campaign featured the words : ' it ’s @entity95			1
money back if he walks			1
we will refund all losing bets on the @entity2 trial if he is found not guilty			1
' tragic : prosecutors allege @entity2 shot model @entity11 through the bathroom door at his home on @entity105 in 2013 the @entity0 ’s decision comes as a @entity108 online petition demanding that @entity3 ' please remove your offensive betting on the outcome of the @entity2 trial and donate any profits so far to a women ’s charity fighting violence against women ' drew more than 120,000 supporters			1
protesters from around the globe who have signed the petition condemned the bet as ' reprehensible ” and ' shameless behaviour '			1
others declared that @entity3 had gone ' too far this time , too far ' and that the ' death of a woman should not be used as a publicity stunt			2
a new disgusting low for the @entity5 '			2
the petition was addressed to @entity3 ’s chief executive @entity129 and stated : ' please consider the vast surge of public outrage against the terrible decision you have taken to offer bets upon the outcome of the @entity2 trial			1
' ( @entity11 ’s ) death is not and should never be a source of entertainment or profit			1
' i have seen your attempt to explain the decision and it is unacceptable			2
138 women died in the @entity5 last year as a result of male violence against women			2
' this is not something that should be seen as ‘ sport ’			2
in order to salvage the situation it would be an act of reparation and humanity to donate any profits to relevant women ’s charities working in the area of domestic violence and abuse			2
' the advert coincided with the @entity95 ceremony in @entity166 and the first day of @entity2 ’ trial in @entity168 , where he formally pleaded not guilty to four charges including the murder of @entity171			1
prosecutors allege @entity2 , 27 , shot his model and reality tv star girlfriend through the bathroom door at his home on @entity177 ’ day in 2013			1
@entity2 claims he mistook her for an intruder			1
complaints : a change.org petition calling for @entity3 to pull the advert garnered more than 120,000 supporters @entity184 , director of @entity185 , said of the ad : ' they are making a game out of murder and the brutal killing of a young woman , which is unacceptable			1
' it is not just that this is a bit sick - it also actually contributes to a culture in which violence against women is trivialised or made into a bit of a joke			2
' this is a really serious problem			2
it is recognised as a human rights issue both here in the @entity5 and in @entity168			2
they should withdraw the ad			2
