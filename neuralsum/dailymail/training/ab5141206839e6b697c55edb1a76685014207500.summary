why have n’t they been able to defend ? among the many head - scratching aspects of @entity4 ’s season , nothing has baffled more than that particular question			1
ultra-reliable last year , with a record that was third best in the @entity8 , this campaign has been miserable ; individual errors , combined with a lack of continuity in personnel and consistency in performance , has led to a hole being blown in @entity4 ’s ambitions			1
during a run of four consecutive defeats – their worst sequence since december 2005 – it led some to ask whether @entity21 should pursue a more prosaic approach			0
if you do n’t concede , you do n’t get beaten but @entity4 have conceded too often and been beaten too frequently			1
@entity24 was imperious in defence for @entity4 during their 1 - 1 draw with @entity28 @entity4 defender stones tracks @entity28 playmaker @entity30 ( right ) at this point 12 months ago , they had conceded 19 goals ; now the tally is 34			1
facing up to one of the most fearsome attacks in @entity39 , then , you would not have expected much to change but , at long last , we were given a glimpse of those characteristics that have served @entity4 so well down the years			2
this was how they should be			0
the minimum requirement of an @entity4 team is to ally prodigious hard work with a refusal to be second best and from the early exchanges in this collision with @entity28 , you could see a return to old fashioned values			1
‘ i thought it was an old - fashioned game with a lot of character and grit , ’ @entity21 observed			2
‘ in the first half , i thought we allowed @entity28 too much space but we defended well			2
we stopped @entity30 and @entity60 being effective in the areas they can operate really well			0
’ @entity21 wants his defenders to play the ball elegantly out from the back but this crowd also likes to see their defenders doing the basics and in @entity69 and @entity24 , @entity4 had the game ’s best pairing at centre - half			1
@entity69 has not had a campaign to remember but , with stones back alongside , this was much more like it			0
tackles were made , interceptions were read and orders were barked out , as @entity4 battled to keep @entity28 at arms ’ length			1
@entity74 gets himself between his goalkeeper @entity83 and @entity28 striker @entity84 ( left ) @entity21 's side looked far stronger at the back with @entity74 in the heart of their defence stones , meanwhile , was outstanding			1
had you never watched a game of football before and were brought into @entity92 with the task of picking out which defender cost £ 32million , you would have picked out this young man from @entity96 , not @entity97			0
if @entity97 found it all happening too quickly , stones – who was being watched by @entity102 head coach @entity101 – exuded calmness , not least when in the first half he took control of a high ball on his chest , turned into space away and started a move with nonchalance			0
most importantly , however , @entity74 showed he could do the dirty work too			0
he was the player @entity97 signed as @entity4 manager two years ago			2
this performance showed why he could prove to be the perfect parting gift .			0

@entity24 was *excellent* for @entity4 against @entity28
@entity117 cancelled out @entity119 's opener in 1 - 1 draw
@entity4 have let in 34 goals this season , *compared* to 19 at this stage last
