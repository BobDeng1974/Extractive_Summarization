as a three - star @entity2 chef renowned for his whacky concoctions such as snail porridge , he was n’t the obvious choice to create a picnic fit for the @entity7			1
but that is exactly what @entity9 did			2
the world - renowned @entity12 chef conjured up a remarkable five - course menu for 12,000 lucky guests who secured free tickets for today ’s @entity17 at @entity18			1
the classic hampers featured traditional @entity12 dishes such as coronation chicken and @entity23 mess with a @entity9 twist – although , unfortunately , there was n’t a puff of his trademark liquid nitrogen in sight			1
lavish affair : a couple find a spot away from the crowds in the grounds of @entity18 to enjoy their special five - course picnic guests began with a chilled country garden soup comprised of baby plum tomatoes and a mint - infused oil , followed by @entity42 tea - smoked @entity41 salmon and @entity44 chicken			1
@entity9 was keen to include the chicken dish as it was originally devised to celebrate the @entity7 ’s official crowning in 1953 and is , surprisingly , a particular favourite of the chef himself			1
@entity51 , 43 , from @entity52 , gave a mixed reaction to @entity9 's @entity54 , an update of @entity43 which was created to mark the @entity7 's coronation in 1953			1
' i tried the little chicken dish and made it into a sandwich			0
i 'm not a lover of @entity62 chicken but it 's certainly edible			0
' ‘ my family used to go for picnics in @entity67 and i used to try and wolf it down before everyone else			0
it ’s just the ultimate curry , ’ he said			2
his included a special secret blend of @entity73 spices with mayonnaise , shredded chicken , coriander and peppery nigella seeds			0
it was followed by a @entity79 with fruit from the @entity7 ’s own estate , meringue , cream and an oat - crumble topping as well as tiny chocolate cakes featuring gold crowns and topped with popping candy , lemon and caraway madeira cake and a cheeseboard			1
there was also vegetarian , dairy and gluten free options			0
apparently the @entity7 tried each and every dish – which took six months to create with the help of royal head chef @entity97 - and gave her seal of approval			1
mr @entity9 told the @entity99 : ‘ despite my name i am @entity12 through and through and very proud of it			0
who would have thought when i was chopping onions a few years ago that i would now be cooking for the @entity7			1
’ the hampers were provided by the @entity7 ’s warrant holder , supermarket @entity106			1
chief executive officer @entity108 said : ‘ her majesty has personally tasted every dish and has been involved in creating everything that goes into the hamper			0
her attention to detail is legendary and we are very proud to be involved in creating them as our jubilee gift to her			0
’ @entity9 's hamper : coronation chicken , @entity9 style , crunch crudites , lemon and cardamon madeira cake , a cheeseboard featuring @entity126 and @entity128 crunch , and the @entity129 ' @entity119 oat cakes in the spirit of things : partygoers opted for flamboyant attire as they geared up for celebrations at @entity18 wacky dress sense ! @entity137 opted for a colourful @entity138 while @entity139 from @entity140 in the north of @entity142 wore some eye - catching shades members of the public queue up to get into @entity18 for the afternoon picnic and evening concert each wicker basket also included a voucher for a glass of @entity152 champagne or @entity153 – ‘ very civilised ’ , as one palace aide put it			2
given sunday ’s inclement conditions , it was also prudent of the palace to have included a waterproof poncho as well as a patriotic @entity159 – although thankfully only a few spots of rain could be felt			2
and as the gates opened at 3pm , a throng of people – many dressed in patriotic red , white and blue – poured through the entrance and into the gardens to devour their treat as a steel pan band from @entity171 and @entity172 optimistically played ‘ @entity174 ’ @entity173 ’			0
among them was @entity176 , from @entity177 , who was celebrating her 60th birthday			0
‘ i almost did n’t come as i forgot to check my emails which told me i had been successful – so what a marvellous present , ’ she said			0
@entity139 , 63 , and husband @entity182 , 65 , from @entity140 , @entity181 wore eye - catching @entity184 flag headbands they had been given at a street party on sunday			2
@entity139 said : ‘ i had a lump in my throat when i came back here , the palace looks unbelievable , it 's such an honour			0
royal chef @entity97 and @entity9 present their jubilee feast @entity9 was interviewed outside @entity18 by @entity194 as guests tucked into his picnic what 's in the bag ? @entity194 reporters opened their hamper to reveal the contents which were created by experimental chef @entity9 palatial setting : an aerial shot of @entity18 and its grounds time to refuel : guests at the @entity207 spent time relaxing in the palace grounds after queuing for several hours ‘ i entered the ballot because i wanted to see @entity211 then i totally forgot about it and bought tickets to see him at the @entity214 next week for £ 87			1
‘ then i got my tickets , so i 'm going to see him next week as well anyway			0
’ @entity217 , a 40 - year - old primary school teacher from @entity218 , was dressed in a @entity184 flag suit she had bought over the internet			2
‘ it ’s a once in a lifetime opportunity so you might as well go for it , ’ she said			2
towards the end of the mini garden party , several members of the royal family – the @entity227 and his daughters , princess @entity229 and @entity230 , @entity231 and the @entity232 and @entity233 – arrived at the palace to meet and greet some of the @entity7 ’s guests			1
‘ this day just could n’t get any better , ’ said 29 - year - old @entity238 , from @entity239			2
and that was before the concert had even started			0
