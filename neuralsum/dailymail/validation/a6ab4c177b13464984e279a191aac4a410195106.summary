the men , who were suspended from their positions as soon as the evidence came to light , pleaded guilty to the abuse , which took place in october and december 2012			0

but now the company which runs @entity11 near @entity12 , north @entity13 , has introduced a policy banning covert cameras			1
relatives have been told that any devices found during inspections of rooms will be removed and the footage retained			0
@entity61 says the ban is down to ' legal issues around filming people without their consent '			1
@entity66 , head of safeguarding and compliance at @entity61 , said : ' @entity70 healthcare condones the use of cameras so long as they are installed in a way that complies with the @entity75 and is in the best interest of the service user			0
' given the legal issues around filming people without their consent and the ability of those who may not have the mental capacity to give proper permission for this to take place , we ask relatives and residents to discuss the placement of cameras with us before they do it			1
' that way , we can have an open dialogue with the family to address the reasons behind why they want to place cameras in the service user 's room , and also to ensure that when cameras are installed it is done so in a way that complies with @entity101 law , regulation and is in the service user 's best interest			2
' but families say the policy ' negates the whole purpose ' of hidden cameras , which bring them peace of mind			1
