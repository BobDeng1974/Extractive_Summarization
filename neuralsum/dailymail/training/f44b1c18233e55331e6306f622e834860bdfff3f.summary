prisoners using mobile phones from behind bars will be cut off under plans to stop them running their criminal empires from their cells			1
ministers are to compel phone firms to act by law to disconnect the mobile numbers of handsets used in jails across the country			2
it follows a warning from home secretary @entity15 that 7,000 known organised criminals are housed in jails , co-ordinating illegal activity in the outside world			1
prisons will use new , cheaper technology to detect where mobile phones are being used and record their numbers , before getting a court judgement forcing mobile firms to disconnect them there were 7,451 mobile phones and sim cards seized in 2013 , according to latest figures			1
however , they are likely to have been replaced by hundreds more smuggled in by visitors and possibly corrupt prison staff			0
mobile phone companies had previously insisted they would not act voluntarily and would require a change in the law to disconnect numbers tracked by prison officers			2
a memo written by mrs may said : ' there are over 7,000 known organised criminals in prison in @entity42 and @entity43			1
' we know of cases of serious crimes including large drug imports , escapes and murders being organised from prison , enabled by illicit mobile phones , ' the @entity44 reported			1
being caught using a mobile phone in prison carries a sentence of up to two more years in jail and an unlimited fine			0
mrs may 's memo added : ' the mobile network operators have told us they are unwilling to disconnect these phones unless compelled by law			0
' for the last three years prison governors have been able to use specialist equipment to block or scramble phone signals to stop them being used by criminals			2
but there have been complaints that installing the technology across all prisons would be ' prohibitively expensive '			1
the @entity70 estimates it would cost £ 300million to install the devices at every prison , with operating costs of £ 800,000 a year			0
there were 7,451 mobile phones and sim cards seized in 2013 , according to latest figures ( file image ) however , acting to disconnect specific numbers of illicit phones will cost around £ 300,000 , with mobile firms £ 212,000 worse off			1
details of new powers will be unveiled tomorrow by ministers who insist it will ' significantly increase ' their ability to tackle the problem			0
prisons will use new , cheaper technology to detect where mobile phones are being used and record their numbers			1
governors could then go to a county court with all the numbers from each prison and young offenders ' institution and obtain a blacklisting order from the court			0
it would mean there would be no need to find and seize the actual handsets from prisoners			0
prisons minister @entity105 said : ' we will never tolerate the use of mobile phones in prisons			2
this proposed new legislation will significantly increase our ability to tackle this problem			0
' he added : ' by ordering a phone to be cut off once it is identified , we will be able to reassure victims and prevent further criminal activity faster and wider than ever before			0
