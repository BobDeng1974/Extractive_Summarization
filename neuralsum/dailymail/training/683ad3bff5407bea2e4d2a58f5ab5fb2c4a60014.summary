@entity0 vowed @entity1 can still topple the @entity2 if the two sides clash in next year 's @entity4 , despite saturday 's loss at @entity6			1
the @entity1 captain shrugged off the bitter ' frustration ' of a fifth successive defeat to the world champions inside a year			1
@entity0 and his players were left devastated having again pushed @entity2 all the way , only to walk off the rain - soaked @entity6 pitch on the wrong end			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 suffers in the @entity6 rain as @entity1 fall to defeat against @entity2 they had so badly wanted to make their own statement of intent just 10 months before @entity1 2015 kicks off at that very ground			1
but the @entity24 flanker , whose side led 14 - 11 at halftime before going down by three points , claimed : ' we could still beat them , especially at home			1
the crowd were fantastic today and will be right behind us in the @entity4			2
we had them on the ropes in that first half and we must remember that			2
' we had the best team in the world on the ropes and we just need to be able to finish them off and put in a similar second half performance			2
@entity2 celebrate scoring their final try against @entity1 to earn a narrow victory ' it 's extremely frustrating to come so close to beating them but just not getting across the line			1
we wanted the win but did n't get it			0
' we wanted to be the pace - setters and impose ourselves on them because they were coming to our place and we needed to put them on the back foot			0
' we did just that with @entity54 may scoring an incredible try from 50 metres or so which really got the crowd going			0
@entity58 celebrates @entity1 's first try ' but then we were a little ill - disciplined and allowed them to kick some goals and we lost the momentum			1
' unfortunately , the second half is where we need to take a look at ourselves			0
' @entity0 defended his decision to go for a scrum and a try rather than kicking a quick drop goal and saving some time when there were just 90 seconds left on the clock			1
he insisted : ' i still think it was the right choice			0
we wanted to win today so i would make the same decision again			0
' @entity0 is confident his team will bounce back and go on to enjoy success in the remaining autumn clashes , with @entity79 up next on saturday followed by matches against @entity81 and @entity82			2
he said : ' we 'd much rather have started with a win but this will set us up nicely for @entity79			0
that 's going to be another massive physical test for the guys but we will be ready for them			0
it 's important to get this result out of our system quickly and get back on the training ground to prepare for the @entity79			0
