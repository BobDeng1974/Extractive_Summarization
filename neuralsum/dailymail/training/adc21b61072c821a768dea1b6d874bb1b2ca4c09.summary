a fist - pumping run down the line , a rare win and a red card for the new boy			1
life is rarely dull for @entity5 and his start to life as a manager in @entity9 was no different			1
he waited six months for this chance , first eyeing a position in the @entity12 and then , in time , the vacancies at @entity14 and @entity15			0
some of his calls around the houses were answered , a few were ignored			0
no - one seemed to want a man who led @entity21 to a win over @entity23 not so long ago			1
so here he is at @entity24			1
they were bottom of the championship going into this one ; they finished it with only their second win of the season and their new boss in the stands			1
@entity24 defender @entity33 ( centre ) scored the only goal of the match heading home on 20 minutes @entity38 ( right ) is congratulated by his team - mates for his goal which moves the @entity41 off bottom spot @entity38 ( left ) celebrates his strike with @entity5 ( centre ) as he scores the first goal of his reign as @entity24 boss he demonstrated his energy for management with a @entity51 - style dance down the line when @entity33 headed @entity24 in front in the first half			1
he ended up in the stands for leaving his technical area one too many times when @entity24 won a late penalty , which @entity59 missed			1
‘ a few times the lady ( the fourth official , @entity61 ) warned me , ’ @entity5 said			1
‘ i tried dealing with it with a bit of humour			0
i wanted to make a decent impression			0
‘ she said i was consistently doing it			0
but you have to understand it was my first game			2
’ and with it , @entity24 are off the bottom of the table			1
‘ it is a start , ’ @entity5 said			2
‘ let ’s get out of the bottom three quick as we can			0
one out of one is all i can ask			0
for us it is a huge win - a clean sheet away and three points			1
i am delighted for the club			2
’ for @entity82 , it means they have now won only once in 11 games in all competitions			2
it is a run made more understandable when you consider how they defended in the first half here			0

with deliveries of quality from @entity106 , it was only going to be a matter of time before they found themselves in a familiar situation			0
it was from a @entity106 cross after 20 minutes that @entity38 headed past @entity114 for the winner			0
yet this was as much a game where @entity82 could have taken a point , such were the chances they had			1
@entity121 and @entity122 both hit the bar , while @entity122 drew two other good saves from @entity125			0
‘ we are frustrated , ’ said @entity82 manager @entity126			2
‘ it seems to be that way ( at the moment )			0
we do n’t get our rewards			0
’ @entity114 was sent off for fouling @entity59 in the 83rd minute , prompting @entity5 to leave his area to advise @entity106 or @entity133 to take the penalty			2
he was sent off and the message did n't get through			0
@entity59 ( left ) won a late penalty for @entity24 after being brought down by @entity114 @entity114 ( left ) was shown a red card by referee @entity139 for the foul but @entity59 missed the penalty			1
