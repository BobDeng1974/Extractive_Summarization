20 - year - old engineering student @entity0 says his latest big idea came naturally			1
‘ it kind of tied in with engineering in that it ’s innovative , it 's not wanting to do the same old , same old , ’ he told @entity2			0
‘ i came back from a trip overseas and said to my mate : ‘ let ’s stop talking about this and just go do it ! ’ so they did			0
in july this year , @entity0 and friend @entity11 from @entity12 got busy fitting out an old van with donated washing machines to start @entity15 : @entity17 ’s first mobile laundry service for the homeless			1
and it ’s already proving a hit with many of the city 's 300 people who sleep rough each night			1
' we 're still at the stage where people see us and are kind of like ' what 's going on here ? ' but word is definitely getting around and the feedback has all been positive , ' says @entity0			1
otherwise , people have to pay $ 5 - $ 6 to do a wash at a laundromat			0
' and $ 6 is a lot of money for someone without a roof over their head , ' says @entity0			2
the @entity15 van , which is installed with two industrial washing machines and two dryers , is currently doing the rounds of six different test locations in the @entity53			1
' we 're trying to link in with some of the morning @entity55 and food vans offered by different groups around the city each day , ' says @entity0			2
' we actually try and get there before the food vans and say to the guys : " @entity62 , we 'll get you through before everyone turns up to watch the show			0
" ' it 's been interesting because some of these guys are pretty set in their ways and some people are a little hesitant until they know us - so its been about us establishing a bit of regular schedule			2
' @entity0 says his favourite part of the job is being able to sit and ' chat with interesting people ' while the washing machines are churning away one load takes about an hour and 15 minutes to wash and dry			1
@entity0 says the thing he enjoys most about the rounds is being able to sit and chat with interesting people in that time			2
' i was chatting with a guy the other day who used to be a chemical engineer			0
it 's just a very grounding experience to see how quickly things can go wrong for people , ' he says			1
' @entity89 is the kind of issue that people turn a blind eye to but i hope that in the future , we 'll be able to engage supporters and even school kids to come out with us in the van , volunteer and get talking to people			2
' in fact , @entity0 says one of the reasons behind the idea for @entity15 was what he and @entity11 saw as a lack of accessible volunteer opportunities for recent school leavers in @entity12			1
picking up the donated industrial washing machines fitting the machines to the old van was a bit of a challenge , ' but we squeezed them in , ' @entity0 says he said there were one or two moments when the friends thought the idea would n't get off the ground			1
the first was trying to fit the washers into the van			0
' the architect who helped us said : " they 'll probably fit " , but we found we needed to build a platform above the wheel arches - it was n't very scientific but we ended up banging the wheel arches out a bit and taking some panels off			0
' the other issue was going through all the legal hoops to operate as a charity			0
' it was very frustrating for @entity137 and i as we 're both pretty impatient people , but we were determined not to let this keep us from hitting the road ! ' @entity0 and @entity11 with their machines donated by @entity143 and @entity144 and the name ? ' well it 's our favourite colour but it 's also the name of a song we really love by @entity148 , ' says @entity0			1
' the song is about helping your brothers and sisters and @entity152 and i , not in a religious way or anything , but we live our lives by the golden rule of treating others as we 'd want to be treated and living to help other people - everyone deserves clean clothes right ? ' @entity15 hopes to be able to expand to provide more mobile laundries nation - wide in 2015			0
‘ i came back from a trip overseas and said to my mate : ‘ let ’s stop talking about this and just go do it ! ’ says @entity0 ( pictured right ) ' @entity15 is an awesome song about helping your brothers and sisters , ' says @entity0 ( @entity170 )			0

@entity12 friends have fitted out an old van with donated washing machines to provide free laundry service for the city 's homeless
300 people sleep rough across @entity12 every night
' it 's just a very grounding experience to see how quickly things can go wrong for people , ' says @entity0
