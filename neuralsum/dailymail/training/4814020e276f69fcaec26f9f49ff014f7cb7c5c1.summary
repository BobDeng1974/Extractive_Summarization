things are going from bad to worse for @entity1 after his spokeswoman went off on an expletive - laden rant about a former campaign intern after she wrote an unflattering expose of his faltering @entity6 mayoral campaign			1
@entity7 was so incensed by @entity9 's actions that she lost her cool - apparently unaware that she was talking on the record - when she was being interviewed by politics website @entity11 about another matter			1
@entity1 's communication director called the former intern a ' fame hungry b * * * * who sucked at her job , ' she also called @entity9 a ‘ s * * * bag , ’ ‘ t * * * , ’ and ‘ c * * * ' and threatened to sue her			1
she claimed many interns had only joined to get closer to @entity1 's wife , @entity31 , in the hope of landing a role in any potential presidential campaign for @entity35 in 2016			1
she claimed that one campaign staffer had left because he had only been paid one - third of what he was promised and that @entity1 incorrectly referred to her and other interns as ' @entity39			1
' @entity7 released a statement on tuesday night apologizing for her outburst			1
need a break ? @entity6 mayoral candidate @entity1 's campaign is in meltdown after a former intern revealed what it was like to work for him and his comms director lost her cool in a very public manner ‘ in a moment of frustration , i used inappropriate language in what i thought was an off the record conversation , ’ she said			1
‘ it was wrong and i am very sorry , which is what i said tonight when i called and emailed @entity9 to apologize			1
’ in the controversial article @entity9 said ‘ a lot ’ of @entity1 ’s staff had ‘ short résumés , ’ including @entity7 , who @entity9 had mocked because she ‘ last worked as the press secretary for the @entity66 state education commissioner			1
’ ‘ i ’m dealing with like stupid f * * king interns who make it on to the cover of the @entity28 even though they signed @entity71 and / or they proceeded to trash me , ’ @entity7 told @entity11 , referring to a non-disclosure agreement that @entity9 would have signed			1
‘ and by the way , i tried to fire her , but she begged to come back and i gave her a second chance			0
’ not how we roll : in a slick new ad , pictured , @entity1 states : ' i know that there are newspaper editors and other politicians that say , " boy , i wish that guy @entity1 would quit " ' @entity7 went on to suggest in her conversation to @entity11 that @entity9 would be unable to ever get another job in @entity6 politics as a result of her actions			1
' f * * * * * * s * * * bag			0
nice f * * king glamour shot on the cover of the @entity28			0
man , see if you ever get a job in this town again , ' said @entity7			2
she also described @entity9 ’s allegation as ‘ b * * * * * * *			2
’ @entity9 is believed to have stopped interning for the campaign four weeks ago and worked on the campaign for about a month			1
@entity7 said @entity9 ’s initially showed some enthusiasm for working for @entity1 , but claimed that her ability left much to be desired			1
she like was n’t good at setting up events			0
she was clearly there because she wanted to be seen			0
like it was , like , terrible and i had to like - she would like , she would just not show up for work , ’ said @entity7			2
‘ for the four weeks she worked there - she did n’t work weekends , so twenty days total			0
of those twenty days , she missed probably five because she would just like not show up and not tell me she was n’t going to be there			0
so , yeah , so there ’s that			0
’ she has n’t commented or tweeted since @entity7 's outburst but has - rather amusingly - updated her @entity112 profile to include several of the expletives used to describe her			1
beleaguered : a glum @entity1 looks distracted as he listens to responses at the forum in @entity116 also on tuesday @entity1 declared in a new ad that he would not quit the mayoral race because quitting ' is n't the way we roll in @entity6 ' despite looking exhausted and miserable at a public appearance just hours earlier			1
in the advert , posted on his campaign website , @entity1 stares straight at the camera and says : ' i know that there are newspaper editors and other politicians that say , " boy , i wish that guy @entity1 would quit			1
" ' but the prolific sexter insists he owes it to @entity6 to stay in the race			2
' this is n't about me			2
this is about helping @entity6			2
because they understand that this is about them			0
this campaign has reminded me about it again and again – in all kinds of ways			2
' the ad was posted on @entity1 's campaign website just hours after photographs showed him rubbing his eyes and sitting glumly in @entity148 , suggesting his latest sexting scandal was finally taking its toll			1
end of the road ? the former congressman has dropped to fourth in the polls and it looks like it is taking its toll he hit out at the media claiming : ' they do n't know @entity6			1
they certainly do n't know me			2
" @entity161 " is n't the way we roll in @entity6			1
' in the video , @entity1 talks directly to the camera about the circus - like scandal dominating news headlines and how it has made him even more keen to serve @entity6			1
' you know , if someone wants to come out with something embarrassing about you in your private life , you got to talk about that for a little while , ' he said			0
' but it 's also reminded me that – citizens , when they come up to you , and they want to talk about a situation on their block , or at their child 's school or something going on at their job site – that that 's what this campaign is all about , ' he added			2
earlier on tuesday , the beleaguered mayoral candidate looked defeated during a forum on small businesses in @entity116			2
but his former sexting partner could not have appeared happier			0

she added : ' i think i am a little bit angry with him , i feel like he lured me in to this situation			0
and then he did n't want to own up to it			2
on the campaign trail [ he was ] saying , " oh i 've changed " and trying to act like he has this perfect marriage now			0
i 'm proof that you have not changed			0
' in another sign that she is enjoying the spotlight , she was seen leaving the @entity234 porn headquarters , and when @entity197 asked her about appearing in @entity236 movies , she hinted it could be a possibility			0

' we 'll see what happens			0
' as well as @entity199 ' refusal to go away , @entity250 is dealing with news that he has plunged to fourth place among @entity254 in a poll taken since the affair emerged			0

and a majority of those same voters said @entity1 - who once led the pack - should withdraw from the race entirely , by a 53 - 40 margin			2
' with six weeks to go , anything can happen , but it looks like former congressman @entity1 may have sexted himself right out of the race for @entity6 mayor , ' said @entity271 , director of the @entity258			1
black voters were the only demographic group that seems to be hanging on to their support for the embattled former congressman , whose latest round of sexting accusations have brought his long - suffering wife out of the shadows to defend him once more			0
all smiles : @entity1 is all smiles at this monday campaign stop at a senior home in @entity284 , @entity6 black voters say @entity1 should stay in the race , by a 53 - 42 margin			1
