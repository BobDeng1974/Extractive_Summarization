now , leaked footage reveals just how close @entity8 's firm came to success , with a close - up view of the daring attempt shot on a @entity13 camera a deleted tweet by @entity8 says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from ' stiction in the biprop throttle valve , resulting in control system phase lag			1
' this means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine was n't moving fast enough			0
as a result , the actions from rocket 's computers could n't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster caused by a gust of wind			1
the video , which appeared on @entity43 , reveals how the rocket overcompensates for its extreme tilt			1
a deleted tweet by @entity8 says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from ' stiction in the biprop throttle valve , resulting in control system phase lag			2
' this means the valve designed to control the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine was n't moving fast enough			0
as a result , the actions from rocket 's computers could n't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster			1
earlier this week @entity0 has released its own dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the @entity5			1
the video , taken from a plane , shows the @entity2 booster lowering itself onto the platform , before exploding on impact			2
the maneuver was attempted following the launch of the @entity2 rocket a few minutes earlier from @entity69 in @entity70			2
soon after the launch , billionaire @entity0 founder , @entity8 , tweeted : ' ascent successful			1
@entity76 landed on droneship , but too hard for survival			0
' the unverified video shows the rocket drifting into view in slow motion and floating onto its target before a gust of wind topples it over pictured is the moment of impact			1
a deleted tweet by @entity8 says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from ' stiction in the biprop throttle valve , resulting in control system phase lag			2
' this means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine was n't moving fast enough landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky			0
@entity0 once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand			1
the autonomous spaceport drone ship is 300ft by 100ft ( 90 by 30 metres ) , with wings that extend its width to 170ft ( 50 metres )			0
@entity8 had put 50 - 50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year			0
despite being destroyed , the booster 's flyback marks another step in the company 's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown , potentially slashing launch costs			1
' this might change completely how we approach transportation to space , ' @entity0 vice president @entity120 told reporters during a prelaunch press conference			2
the @entity2 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb ( 1,950 kg ) of food , clothing and science experiments to the @entity131 - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts			1
the supplies today arrived at the @entity131 the rocket was was due to take off on monday , but the launch was scrubbed due to bad weather			1
the video , taken from a plane on tuesday , shows the the @entity2 booster lowering itself onto the platform , before a gust of wind sways it to one side on board the dragon capsule was an experimental espresso machine intended for @entity131 astronaut @entity148 of @entity149			1
' we 're very , very happy to have it here , ' @entity148 radioed to mission controllers in @entity153 today			0
the @entity149 in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee - drinking in space			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first - stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off @entity70 's northeastern coast , near @entity162			1
@entity163 has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named ' @entity166 ' in 2019			0
@entity166 will use new engines , mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on - orbit manoeuvres			0
the company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow @entity0 ' launch of @entity2 , which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable			1
the aim of both @entity0 and @entity163 is to end @entity178 dependence on @entity180 - built rocket engines , but the technology has so far proven difficult			1
@entity163 's plan is to skip returning the whole booster , an approach favoured by rival @entity0			1
it hopes to separate the engines after launch , inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air			0
the booster managed to land on the barge but @entity8 said that ' excess lateral velocity ' caused it to tip over @entity8 tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to @entity197			1
@entity8 had put 50 - 50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year the booster was programmed , following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff , to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed ' just read the @entity206 ' in the @entity5 @entity8 's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world , to reduce launch costs			2
first - stage boosters normally just slam into the @entity5 and sink			0
the booster was programmed , following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff , to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed ' just read the @entity206			0
' @entity216 — the only supply ship capable of returning items intact — will remain at the space station until around may 21			0
during a previous landing attempt in january , the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins , causing it to crash into the platform			2
a second attempt in february was called off because of high seas , but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart			2
at liftoff time , the orbiting lab was soaring over @entity231			0
the delivery of food and equipment arrived today the launch sequence as it happened			0
all stages of the launch went to plan , except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket			0
@entity0 once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand @entity8 recently unveiled the images of the @entity2 failed second landing after persuasion on @entity249 by the game pioneer behind @entity251 , @entity252			2
the images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month 's attempt			1
after it fails to reduce its speed , the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding			0
@entity261 described the event simply as a ' rapid unscheduled disassembly '			0
this is the @entity266 - based @entity0 company 's seventh station supply run since 2012 , all from @entity69			2
@entity0 is one of two companies hired by @entity269 to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles			2
as well as a recently extended 15 - flight , $ 2 billion contract with @entity269 , @entity0 is working on a passenger version of the @entity277 and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit			2
the company also is working on a heavy - lift version of the @entity2 rocket , which uses 27 engines , compared to the nine currently flying			0
the @entity285 is expected to make its first test flight late this year			0
while the booster landing did n't go to plane , the launch was successful			0
it took place at 4.10 et from @entity70 under perfect conditions , after a attempt had to be scrubbed on monday due to lightning			0

on tuesday , @entity0 made a third attempt to land booster on a barge
but the booster tipped over after hitting its target and was destroyed
new footage reveals how rocket overcompensated for its extreme tilt
