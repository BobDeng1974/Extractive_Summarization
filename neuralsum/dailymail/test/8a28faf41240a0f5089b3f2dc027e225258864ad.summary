it is still @entity1 - but not quite as we know it			1
the fierce rivalry between @entity5 and @entity6 has dominated @entity8 football for much of the past decade , reaching its crescendo when the two titans met in the 2013 @entity12 final at @entity13			1
for a while , @entity1 represented the pinnacle of @entity17 football			2
briefly , it carried as much relevance on the continental stage as @entity21 between @entity22 and @entity23 - maybe even more			0
@entity24 of @entity6 looks dejected after @entity25 of @entity5 scored an equaliser during @entity1 between the teams at the @entity28 in november @entity29 eventually grabbed the winner five minutes from time as @entity5 defeated @entity6 2 - 1 former @entity6 striker @entity25 ( left ) battles with defender @entity32 during the recent @entity34 clash at the @entity28 but as these two prepare to meet in front of an 80,000 audience at the @entity39 on saturday evening , some of that lustre has been lost			1
there is something unsettling about @entity5 and @entity6 being separated by nine @entity34 places and a whopping 31 points			1
it just does n't seem right , they should be no 1 and no 2			0
it feels very weird that nothing is riding on the outcome , at least so far as the title race is concerned			2
a @entity5 win will confirm what we already know , that they will be champions for a third successive season			1
@entity5 's @entity29 scores past @entity6 's goalkeeper @entity54 during the 2013 @entity12 final at @entity13 @entity5 defeated @entity6 2 - 1 at @entity13 to win the @entity12 - a period in which @entity1 was one of the highlights on the @entity17 football calendar a @entity6 win would make a little dent in @entity5 's 10 - point lead but is n't likely to derail their serene progress to retaining the shield			1
it would , however , boost their hopes of qualifying for @entity66			0
therein lies the problem - these two have experienced contrasting seasons in the extreme , to the point where the transferable @entity1 tag could soon be applied to another fixture - perhaps @entity5 vs @entity73 or @entity5 vs @entity74			1
having been rock - bottom at the beginning of february , @entity75 's @entity6 embarked on a seven - match unbeaten run , winning five , and could salvage a modicum of respectability from a disastrous season - and perhaps offset a summer exodus of their best players - by finishing in the top six			1
@entity85 celebrates scoring for @entity6 with @entity25 in their 1 - 0 win at @entity5 in november 2011 - both have since joined @entity5 as @entity6 have slipped down the table for @entity75 , whose reputation around @entity66 has taken a battering this season , insists that @entity1 is still as significant as ever			1
' we 've got to try to beat @entity5 and where that can take us in the league is secondary , ' he said			2
@entity85 refuses to celebrate after scoring for @entity5 against @entity6 in november 2013 ' although we 're 10th , and although there 's a huge points gap between us , and although a lot is different compared to the past , it 's still a @entity6 home game			1
' i do n't recall us gifting any of these games in the past			0
@entity102 have shown us how it 's done			0
@entity73 have also beaten them , but it 's not all that easy			0
' @entity6 do have positive recent memories in this fixture to draw upon			2
they won 3 - 0 at the @entity28 at the tail end of last season , for example , though it came far too late to alter the destination of the title , which @entity5 won by 19 points			1
they completed the double over their rivals en route to winning their back - to - back @entity116 in 2010 - 2011 and 2011 - 2012			0
but those great moments seem a long time ago now and the fixture is harder to hype without so much riding on it			0
another source of optimism for @entity75 is @entity5 's mounting injury list , with winger @entity125 , who has a recurring ankle problem , joining @entity29 and @entity127 on the sidelines			2
not that club chief executive @entity129 was panicking : ' we can not change it and it would be a mistake if @entity5 started to lament now			0
another thrilling climax to the season awaits for @entity135 and his team - they are coasting to a 25th championship , travel to @entity140 in the last eight of the @entity142 and @entity143 in the same stage of the @entity12			0
another @entity145 looms for this all - conquering side			0
and , for a change , @entity6 are in no position to affect that .			0

@entity6 host @entity5 on saturday at @entity39
teams contest @entity155 's biggest *domestic* game , @entity1
but little is riding on it with @entity5 *cruising* to @entity34 title
@entity6 hope home win will keep them in shout of @entity163 spot
