in 1491 , @entity1 cartographer @entity0 created a map of the world that would help @entity4 navigate the @entity5			1
today , the map holds secrets about what @entity8 in the 15th @entity10 knew about geography			0
but unfortunately much of its historic text has faded			2
but now a team of researchers in the @entity16 is using a technique called multispectral imaging to uncover the hidden information that @entity4 had at his fingertips			1
in 1491 , cartographer @entity0 created a map of the world that would help @entity4 navigate the @entity5			1
today , it holds secrets into what 15th century @entity8 knew about geography the @entity30 map depicts the @entity32 's surface from the @entity5 in the west to @entity34 in the east and is surrounded with descriptions in @entity37 of various regions and civilisations			1
for instance , a text box over northern @entity41 describes the ' @entity44 ' people who ' live without wine or wheat and get their nutrients from deer meat '			2
but much of the other text is illegible			0
scientists working as part of the @entity52 are now using a technique which involves capturing multiple images of the map at specific frequencies of light , including ultraviolet and infrared			1
the images are digitally combined and processed in a way that uncovers information otherwise hidden to the naked eye			1
the @entity30 map depicts the @entity32 's surface from the @entity5 in the west to @entity34 in the east and is surrounded with descriptions in @entity37 of various regions and civilisations			1
pictured is the @entity30 map during preparations for multispectral imaging scientists are now using a technique which involves capturing multiple images of the map at specific frequencies of light , including ultraviolet and infrared			1
the images are digitally combined and processed in a way that uncovers information otherwise hidden to the naked eye ' the @entity30 map is an incredibly strong candidate for this kind of technology , ' said @entity83 , a map historian and the team leader for the project			1
' you just know it 's going to pop. ' the @entity88 was created in 1491 by @entity1 cartographer @entity0			0
it 's said that @entity4 used this map or one like it to persuade @entity90 and @entity91 to support him in the early 1490s			2
the map was made by a @entity1 cartographer living in @entity94 and reflects the latest theories about the form of the world and the most accurate ways of portraying it on a flat surface			0
it seemed to prove that , as @entity4 argued , there was n't a great distance between @entity8 and @entity104 by sea			0
the map is also the first to record the rounding of the @entity108 in @entity109 by the @entity110 in 1488			0
this proved that there was n't a land link to @entity41 in the south - and that @entity8 could reach the riches of the @entity115 by sea without having to go through @entity118 - held lands			0
according to a report by @entity121 in @entity122 , the team scanned the map last month and expect to start extracting text in the next few months			0
as well as professor @entity83 , the project involved @entity126 , a professor of @entity127 at @entity128 , dr @entity129 , an associate professor of @entity130 at the @entity131 and @entity132 , chief executive of @entity133			0
as well as uncovering hidden details about civilisations depicted in the map , multispectral imaging could shed light on the history of map building			1
for instance , the @entity30 map has similarities to @entity145 's world map of 1507 – the first map to apply the name ' @entity16 ' to the @entity148			2
in 2012 , professor @entity83 had infrared and ultraviolet images taken of the @entity30 map , which revealed enough of the hidden text to show that the map was a key source for @entity145 's 1507 map			1
' one of the most exciting images i 've ever seen of a map is an ultraviolet image of the @entity30 map taken in the early ' 60s , ' professor @entity83 told @entity122			1
' if you look at eastern @entity41 with natural light , if you look closely , you get a hint that there 's text there , but if you look in ultraviolet light suddenly you see that there 's text everywhere			0
' he added that extracting legible text from all those images will take a lot of imaging processing and analysis			2
the project is expected to be complete sometime next year			0
