the majority of the messages are too disgusting to print here			2
in an early grooming text to the girl , who had just celebrated her 14th birthday , @entity2 tells her : ‘ you are just amazing , you really are			1
’ soon after , he promises her that he will ‘ make you toast in the morning , make you laugh and smile and never hurt you and always be there to catch you and everything ’			0

xxx ’ bombarded : excerpts from three of the messages , most of which are too explicit to be printed then he demands : ‘ just try xxx i want to know what you ’d do to me			2
’ then he says : ‘ or you just want me to make you ... and you can			0
xx ’ the girl changed from a confident , happy , outgoing teenager to becoming increasingly withdrawn and secretive as the messages from @entity2 became more graphic and insistent			1

‘ she is blameless , but feels as if she has done something wrong			0
judge @entity95 suspended @entity2 's sentence after he heard glowing references ‘ i never imagined that she would be in danger from someone that she knew and who came from a family with decent , hard - working parents			1
