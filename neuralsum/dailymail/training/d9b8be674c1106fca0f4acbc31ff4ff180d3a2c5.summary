@entity1 , 24 , who is subject to a @entity12 ( @entity12 ) for previous offending of a similar nature , attempted to steal the woman 's shoe as she walked home from a takeaway on her birthday night out on october 5 last year			1
his barrister , @entity19 told @entity20 that her client ' likes stiletto heeled shoes , particularly those which are larger than five inches , and gets sexual gratification from holding such shoes '			1
jailing @entity1 for 16 months , judge @entity26 told him : ' you are a high risk to the public , particularly to lone females , and you have a fetish with high heeled shoes with stiletto heels			1
' @entity33 , prosecuting , told @entity20 : ' at the end of the evening , on the way home , she called into a takeaway , ' he said			1
' she was sitting on the bench outside with a friend as they ate their takeaway when she noticed a man hanging around nearby			2
' she began the short walk home alone and saw the same male walking close behind her			2
he tried to engage her in conversation and she became very concerned			2
' she had almost reached the safety of her home when the defendant approached her and attempted to remove her shoe			1
' she kicked out with some force and the defendant made off			2
' the defendant , who was convicted of robbery for an earlier offence when he succeeded in taking a shoe off another woman , was made the subject of a @entity60 in 2010 and was placed under a three - year @entity61			1
mr @entity33 added : ' there was a clear underlying sexual motive in this case			0
' the woman has clearly been extremely unnerved by the offence and that has had an affect on her life			2
' he said the victim was more vulnerable because the offence took place late at night and she had been walking alone , although the degree of force used had been minimal			0
@entity1 , from @entity73 , @entity74 , who insisted he had been at home with his partner on the night of the incident , later pleaded guilty to the charge of attempted theft			1
@entity19 , defending , told the court : ' rarely do such cases come before the court			0
' referring to a psychiatric report , mrs @entity19 said : ' mr @entity1 likes stiletto heeled shoes , particularly those which are larger than five inches , and gets sexual gratification from holding such shoes			1
' for his victim it must have been a very frightening experience			0
it was not his intent to harm her and he did not intend for her to feel threatened			0
' the gravity of this offence is the fact he has caused the distress			0
it was to satisfy his own sexual needs and urges			0
' he has problems which he acknowledges and he would be willing to take any help that could be provided			0
@entity1 's barrister , @entity19 told @entity20 ( pictured ) that her client ' likes stiletto heeled shoes , particularly those which are larger than five inches , and gets sexual gratification from holding such shoes ' this man is moved by desires and needs that he does n't know how to cope with			1
' it is low level offending but it is the nature of the offence which makes it troubling			0
' according to a psychiatric report written in 2010 , @entity1 ' has a lack of empathy , understanding and motivation ' and so no therapy could be offered by the court			1
judge @entity26 , speaking at @entity3 , said : ' you have the conviction of robbery in similar circumstances			0
' you were in breach of the @entity12 and the @entity61 when committing this offence			1
' you spotted the woman you later followed when you heard her high heeled shoes going down the street			2
there is no doubt she was terrified			0
' since then , suffered from a lack of confidence and felt very upset			0
she worries that she might be attacked again			0
' you are not motivated to change and so can not be helped medically at this stage			0
you are a high risk to the public , particularly to lone females , and you have a fetish with high heeled shoes with stiletto heels			1
' the previous @entity61 did not prevent you from committing this offence and neither did the @entity12			2
' @entity1 was given a custodial sentence of 16 weeks and a restraining order has been placed on him to prevent any contact with his victim .			1
