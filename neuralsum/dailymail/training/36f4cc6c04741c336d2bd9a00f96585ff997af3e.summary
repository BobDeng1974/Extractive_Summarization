by @entity0 published : 22:18 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 03:23 est , 9 august 2013 workmen spent a morning ripping up a woman 's drive before realising they had been sent to the wrong address			2
@entity6 , 50 , returned home to find her concrete and pebble driveway reduced to rubble			1
at first she thought her home in @entity12 , @entity13 , had been targeted by vandals			1
uh oh : @entity6 returned home to find her concrete and pebble driveway reduced to rubble then she realised the same workers were busy digging up another drive a few doors down - the one they were supposed to have done in the first place			1
@entity22 , owner of @entity23 , in @entity24 , @entity13 , admitted it was his blunder and had sent the men to the wrong address			1
mrs @entity6 made a frantic call to husband , @entity29 , 37 , before discovering the ' culprits ' had set to work on another driveway further down her road			1
mrs @entity6 , who 'd been away for five hours , said : ' i came home from work to find my driveway had been completely ripped up			1
' i simply could not believe my eyes			2
i called my husband and was screaming down the phone that someone had torn our drive up			2
' i went to a neighbour to see if they had seen anything			2
mix - up : @entity6 thought her home in this street in @entity12 , @entity13 , had been targeted by vandals ' they had watched the whole thing , but thought we knew about it and did n't question it ! i just wandered around in a bit of a daze and then spotted workmen down the road			1
' mrs @entity6 confronted the workers from @entity24 - based @entity60 on monday			1
she said : ' they had got a text from their boss asking where they were because the real client had called him saying they were n't there			0
' they replied they were there and had just dug the drive up			0
then they realised they had been sent to the wrong number			0
' after discovering the mistake the workers went to work at the right address , but later returned to remove all the smashed rubble from mrs @entity6 's front			1
after the initial shock , the couple saw the funny side			0
mrs @entity6 said : ' we finished up laughing hysterically			1
' it was just a mistake and the company is going to replace my driveway			1
' we were going to do it anyway , but just not so soon ! and i 've even paid a bit more to get an upgrade so i will soon have a nice cobbled driveway			2
' @entity22 , owner of the company , carried the can for the mix - up			1
he said : ' the guys just went to the wrong house after i gave them the wrong number			0
i got mixed up with another job			0
' when i got a call from the customer asking where we were i thought it was strange and then realised they were at the wrong house			0
' i went up there to sort it out for her			0
we will be putting in a new drive for her later this week and , yes , she has gone for an upgrade			0
' mr @entity22 , 46 , added : ' she was very nice about it			0
some people would have got more angry but she took it well			0
i do n't think they guys would have dug it up if it had n't looked so bad			0
i think she is pleased she is getting a new drive			0
' the customer who had been expecting the company were unaware of the mix - up at the time .			2

@entity6 returned home to find her driveway reduced to rubble
owner of firm said the company has *agreed* to *re-pave* the driveway
