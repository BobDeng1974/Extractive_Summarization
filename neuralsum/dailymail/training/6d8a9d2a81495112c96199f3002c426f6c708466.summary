by @entity0 published : 10:11 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 10:32 est , 2 january 2013 january @entity1 are clearly unheard of in @entity3 's @entity2 , judging by the look of this hyena			1
the series of images show the wild animal breaking out into what appears to be manic laughter			0
the butt of the joke is , however , anyone 's guess			1
photographer @entity15 who captured the hilarious sight said : ' the hyena with his motley pattern coat entertained us like no other			1
' like a truly talented ' @entity31 ' , he left this laugh for last - seeming to grin from ear to ear			1
' he did not wait for the encore , just disappeared in the grass like a soft breeze			0
' hyenas make a variety of vocalisations , including howling screams , wailing calls , and the well - known ' laughter ' used to alert other clan members up to three miles away of a food source			1
researchers found that the pitch of the hyena 's laughter reveals its age			1
variation in the frequency of notes indicates whether an animal is dominant or subordinate			0
younger hyenas tend to have high - pitched ' giggles ' while the dominant females of the group make a narrower range of sounds			1
the cackles are usually produced when hyenas are squabbling over food			1
but the scientists say they may also be a sign of frustration or used to summon help			2
having a wild time : looks like the hyena is in unstoppable belly laugh mode scientists believe the cackles reveal much about the hyena			1
the pitch can reveal its age , and variation of notes indicates whether an animal is dominant or subordinate			0
this may allow them to establish feeding rights and organise their feeding activities			0
the laugh may also help hyenas fend off lions who muscle in on their kills			1
a solitary hyena has no chance when confronted by a lion , whereas a hyena group often can ' mob ' one or two lions and get their food back			2
the other explanation , of course , is that they are just high on life ' the hyena 's laugh gives receivers cues to assess the social rank of the emitting individual , ' said dr @entity105 , who led the study at the @entity107			1
' this may allow hyenas to establish feeding rights and organise their food gathering activities			2
' he said the laugh could also help hyenas fend off lions who often muscle in on their kills			1
' a solitary hyena has no chance when confronted by a lion , whereas a hyena group often can ' mob ' one or two lions and get their food back , ' he said			2
' @entity122 could therefore allow the recruitment of allies			0
' when a member of the same hyena clan hears the call , it can identify the laugh and decide whether to answer or ignore it			2
hyenas , which usually move about on their own , live in groups of up to 80 led by a single female			2
they are extremely noisy and their whoops , cries and cackles can be heard up to three miles away at night			0
although known as scavengers , they are actually efficient hunters , tracking down wildebeest , zebra , buffalo and gazelles			0
a single hyena can devour up to 30lb of meat a day and a group can demolish a zebra in half an hour			0
they can clamp their jaws with a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch - strong enough to crack the bones of a giraffe			0
creasing up : and the laughter continues			0
no january blues for this one watch : hyenas breaking out into uncontrollable laughter			0

amazing moment captured in @entity3 's @entity2
scientists believe laugh helps hyenas fend off lions
