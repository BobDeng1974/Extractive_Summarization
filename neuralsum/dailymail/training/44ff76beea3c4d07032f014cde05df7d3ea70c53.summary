by @entity0 published : 08:55 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 10:43 est , 17 october 2013 @entity1 was the first ever plus - size winner in the history of @entity4 and has since launched a plus - size dating site , worked with @entity6 and fronted hundreds of campaigns			1
so , it made perfect sense to call on the 26 - year - old to launch new plus - size @entity12 magazine and denim brand beauty in @entity14 ’ pop - up boutique yesterday			1
@entity1 , who won the modelling show back in 2008 , told @entity17 that she ’s extremely proud to be representing the new boutique because it goes where no other designers have gone before			1
new opening : @entity1 launches @entity14 boutique yesterday and is carrying the torch for curvy women after being the first ever plus - size model to win @entity4 in 2008 ‘ @entity26 , who curated the store , travels to @entity28 and searches the markets for good quality pieces that are worth the money , instead of polyester crap that many designers sell , ’ she said			1
@entity1 believes that the @entity35 plus - size market is seriously lacking			1
‘ in @entity37 , there are n’t that many plus - size options or designers			1
the @entity35 is behind in identifying with the plus - size consumer			1
i ’m not sure that @entity41 has embraced it necessarily but they have got the products			2
’ sharing her top tips on dressing , @entity1 emphasised one key point : ‘ wear clothes that fit you , ’ she said			1
‘ that ’s the number one issue			0
women try and cover themselves up so they wear clothes that are too big but it makes them look frumpy			2
i cut the sizes out of everything - you do n’t need to know			2
@entity57 : @entity1 recently starred in a @entity59 lingerie campaign and says she will never bow to pressure to lose weight for the sake of fashion ‘ there will never be one perfect size			1
@entity66 is a size 8 and some people say she ’s too fat and she looks like a cow			2
‘ we are never going to be a size that is generally accepted by everyone so you have to get over it			2
especially with airbrushing , we are trying to look like an image that literally does n’t exist			0
' there will never be one perfect size			2
@entity66 is a size 8 and some people say she 's too fat and she looks like a cow , ' says @entity1 ‘ plus - size starts at a size 6 ( @entity35 size 10 ) in the @entity41 but the average woman is a size 10 ( @entity35 size 14 ) so we are telling people that even if you ’re half the size of the average woman , you ’re too fat			1
why ? probably because it sells ; it makes women feel bad about themselves and they buy more products			2
‘ if men were only attracted to women who looked like @entity95 , then we would all look like her			2
but they ’re not and that ’s why we are all different shapes and sizes			0
’ @entity1 has taken it upon herself to spread her message to the masses in her role as an ambassador for the @entity103			1
she travels to @entity104 all over the @entity105 and attends global charity events to support the cause			0
speaking about her work , she said : ‘ after winning the show i knew i wanted to be involved in philanthropy and as the only plus - size model in the history of the show i knew i needed to do something in touch with that ; it felt like a good fit for me			1
‘ @entity104 age is when you ’re deciding who you ’re going to be for the rest of your life so i love that i ’m impacting on people			0
’ and it seems like her hard work is paying off			0
she was recently named one of the most influential women in the world , beating off stiff competition from the likes of @entity131 and @entity132			2
‘ it was a really big deal , i was totally surprised by that and i did n’t realise the impact of what i do , ’ she said			0
one thing @entity1 refuses to do is bow to pressure to eat less or exercise more in the name of her figure			1
‘ i travel all the time , i have n’t been home in over a year because i am literally on a plane every other day ’ ( she recently shot 200 outfits in one day during a shoot in @entity146			2
) ‘ when i can and i have the energy , i run because it ’s the easiest thing to do but i do n’t ever do anything i do n’t want to do			0
‘ i ’ll eat what i want to and i think that ’s the problem – people stop listening to their bodies and start listening to the media			0
‘ we have a multi-million pound diet industry that wants us to think we are fat so they succeed , they get our favourite celebrities on board and the problem is that no one is listening to themselves			0
‘ if i want a steak and chips , i am going to eat it and when i feel like going on a run , i will			0
contender : @entity1 was recently named one of the most influential women in the world by wesbite msn.com , ‘ but i ’m never going to force myself to do that			1
life is too short ; i could walk outside and get hit by a bus so i may as well eat what i want to eat , ’ she said			0
‘ i think what is hard about the plus - size industry is that you ’re never the right size			1
i ’ve had people telling me to lose weight as well as gain weight			0
‘ at the end of the day , you have to look in the mirror and say : “ this is it , this is the only body i ’ve got			2
” ‘ i ’ve definitely been criticised for marching to the beat of my own drum but i take pride in that			0
you ca n’t listen to anyone			0
i ’ll get called a fat cow or that i am huge			0
the show is in over one hundred countries so i get hate mail from lots of people but the fan mail is worth so much more than that			0
‘ i get letters saying “ my daughter had bulimia for two years and because of you she has sought treatment ” , and just that one fan letter is worth more than all the hate letter in the world			0
‘ it ’s so much more motivational than one saying “ you ’re fat ”			0
’ hard worker : @entity1 worked with @entity6 on a @entity213 campaign , as well as working with @entity215 star @entity214 , who she says is ' hilarious ' and has a great plus - size clothing collection on top of helping young women beat their demons , @entity1 has been working non-stop			1
earlier this month she posed in her underwear for a @entity59 campaign ( and she ’s already shot another one with the lingerie label ) and she is about to pen a column in @entity12 magazine about her life as a plus - size model			1
she even scored an opportunity to work with superstar @entity6 in a @entity213 commercial			1
' life is too short ; i could walk outside and get hit by a bus so i may as well eat what i want to eat ' ‘ she was really nice actually , her posse was really kind of rude but she was one of the first celebrities i worked with and she was telling me i was beautiful			1
wow , ’ she said of the surreal experience			0
another fellow celebrity she has huge respect for is @entity215 star @entity214 , who she once worked with			2
‘ @entity214 did n’t know who i was but she kept telling me i should be an impersonator for @entity244 , she ’s hilarious			0
‘ she has some pretty maxi dresses in her plus - size range			1
she ’s a great spokesperson and has undoubtedly grown up a plus - size girl and did n’t have a lot of options			1
’ despite hanging out with superstars , @entity250 - born @entity1 does find that the hard work takes its toll			1
‘ there ’s times when i wake up and i do n’t know what country i ’m in and i did it alone for a long time but now i have a boyfriend and he is travelling with me so that ’s really good			0
‘ we met at high school and randomly got back in touch recently			0
he is amazing and unbelievably supportive			0
it ’s hard for guys to date someone who does what i do			0
’ big break : @entity1 walks on the catwalk at a @entity272 fashion show as part of the final series 10 @entity4 show while she has been occupying her days with @entity276 shoots and fashion campaigns , her ultimate dream is to open a bakery			1
‘ i have a @entity281 channel called @entity282 and i make pumpkin bread , sugar cookies , chocolate covered peanut balls and snicker doodles			0
‘ my boyfriend was a chef			0
i would love to open a bakery with him when i settle down and slow down at work , ’ she said			2
but for now , she is happy carrying the torch for her fellow curvy females			2
‘ the reason i went on top model was because i wanted to live out my motto : “ you must be the change you wish to see in the world ”			0
‘ there was no other plus - size model that was really outspoken about the industry and i feel like i have accomplished everything that was on my check - list			1
‘ if i did stop modelling tomorrow , i would be satisfied with the work i have done			0
’ @entity305 and @entity306 in @entity14 have opened a pop - up shop on @entity308 , @entity37			2
both aim to create beautiful and well fitting clothes for curvy women , and the store features jeans and occasion wear			1
beauty in @entity14 are a premium denim brand who use clever tricks ( like in - built shapewear and perfectly positioned pockets ) to give women the ultimate slimming jeans			1
@entity305 describes itself as a ' highly curated , luxury fashion boutique for women size 16 +			1
