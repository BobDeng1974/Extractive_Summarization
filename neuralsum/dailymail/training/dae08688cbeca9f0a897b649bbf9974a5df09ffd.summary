middle aged women who regularly do aerobics , @entity2 or step classes are protecting themselves against breast cancer , research shows			1
doing half an hour ’s vigorous activity a day – including squash or a spinning class – reduces the risk by a fifth			2
scientists also found that obese women are over 50 per cent more likely to develop the illness than those who are slim			2
women who did three hours of vigorous physical activity a week were found to be at 21 per cent lower risk than those who did little or no exercise around one in eight women in the @entity20 eventually get breast cancer – around 50,500 a year – but there is growing evidence that a healthy lifestyle can hugely lower this risk			1
researchers at @entity27 spent three years following 126,000 women who had been through the menopause , and recorded whether they developed the disease			1
they also filled in detailed questionnaires about how often they exercised , their weight , diet and drinking and smoking habits			0
women who did three hours of vigorous physical activity a week were found to be at 21 per cent lower risk than those who did little or no exercise			1
this includes intensive gym classes such as spinning or dance workouts – but not gentle jogging , walking or cycling			0
and women with the highest body fat were 55 per cent more likely to have developed the illness than those who were slim			2
scientists have known for some time that being overweight or obese increases a woman ’s risk of breast cancer			1
they think that fat cells increase levels of the hormone oestrogen , which encourages the growth of tumours			0
but the @entity27 team suspect that exercise may provide greater benefits in protecting against cancer , aside from simply preventing weight gain			2
one theory is that intensive physical activity further lowers the amount of oestrogen			0
figures show that fewer than half of women meet the @entity73 ’s recommended exercise guidelines of at least two - and - a - half hours a week a breast cancer drug rejected by the @entity73 rationing body can extend survival times by five months , a study has revealed			1
@entity78 could benefit up to 1,200 @entity20 women a year – but was turned down by @entity80 in 2012 because of a lack of evidence			1
however a study involving 1,800 women found it increased survival time by three months for those with a type of breast cancer known as @entity91 negative			1
and for women with another form called triple negative , the average survival time increased by five months , scientists at @entity93 found			2
the drug – which costs many thousands of pounds a year – is given as an injection at the same time as women have chemotherapy			0
the findings will be presented at the @entity103 in @entity104 today , and have been hailed as ‘ encouraging ’			0
campaigners hope the research will prompt @entity80 to re-assess whether the drug could be given to patients on the @entity73			0
professor @entity109 , a @entity110 scientist from the cancer epidemiology unit at @entity27 , said : ‘ what ’s really interesting about this study is that [ reduction in breast cancer risk ] does not appear to be solely due to the most active women being slimmer , suggesting that there may be some more direct benefits of exercise for women of all sizes			1
' we do n’t yet know exactly how physical activity reduces risk ... but some small studies suggest that it could be linked to the impact on hormone levels in the body			0
’ he said that more research was needed to look at the link between women ’s hormone levels and the apparent prevention of cancer			2
women who are slim and fit in middle age have probably been so for most of their lives , so will have been experiencing any potential cancer - protecting benefits for years			1
but professor @entity109 said that taking up exercise or losing weight in middle age could still help prevent the illness			0
figures show that fewer than half of women meet the @entity73 ’s recommended exercise guidelines of at least two - and - a - half hours a week			0
but @entity151 , head of cancer prevention at @entity110 , said this study ‘ confirms that the benefits of staying active go beyond just burning calories ’ .			0

healthy lifestyle can hugely lower the risk of developing breast cancer
