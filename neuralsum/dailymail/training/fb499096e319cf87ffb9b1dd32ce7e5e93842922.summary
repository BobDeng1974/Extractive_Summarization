by @entity0 a fascinating set of maps show the the relentless spread of slavery in the early @entity5 as the need for crops drove farmers , and the enslaved humans who toiled for them , ever westward starting at the dawn of the 19th century			1
the federal government created a massive data map measuring 2 - feet by 3 - feet as the @entity15 began to appear inevitable			2
it was an early version of the data maps so popular on the internet today and showed the exact percentage of enslaved people in each @entity5 county			1
@entity22 himself used it as he and his generals hashed out their strategies of war			0
fast forward to now and modern day historian @entity28 has used the impressive example of early data maps as inspiration for his own cultural cartography			1
on their backs : a @entity36 history ph.d. candidate has created a series of maps that reveal the expansion of slavery in early @entity5 as men in bondage helped carry the nation west loads of data : historian @entity28 used data from the very first @entity5 census in 1790 through the 1860 census just before the @entity15 zooming in : the maps give a county - by - county look at the enslaved population of rapidly growing @entity5 and reveal that the regions where slavery was most prevalent remained constant through the antebellum years @entity55 expansion : @entity28 finds that instead of through intensification in the regions with the most agricultural activity , slavery grew by leaps and bounds up until the @entity15 through westward expansion @entity28 's maps begin with the first @entity5 census in 1790 and continue until the days leading up to the @entity15			1
they reveal how shockingly pervasive and seemingly unstoppable the spread of slavery truly was			2
they also show the areas where slaves made up the greatest proportion of population : notably in the famously agricultural regions of the @entity73 along the mighty @entity74 , the seemingly more northern @entity75 , and all along the southern @entity77 coast			0
here , though , @entity28 's data strikes a surprising note as it shows that -- while enslaved men and women were common here -- the density of slaves remained largely constant throughout the antebellum years			2
@entity28 finds that it was through expansion , and not intensification , that the numbers of enslaved reached nearly 4 million in these years			1
' in other words , slavery was not the paternalist institution that its apologists made it out to be , ' @entity28 writes on @entity94			0
' it was an relentlessly exploitative system where the fundamental relation of owner to enslaved was defined by the markets			0
' the face of @entity5 growth : agriculture was the driving force behind the westward movement of slaves and behind much of the massive early growth of @entity5			2
@entity28 's work shows all too well exactly what made these human economic engines commodities rather than people the @entity5 federal government created this 2 - foot by 3 - foot map , one of the earlier examples of data maps , in 1861			1
the map shows the exact percentage of the population in each county that was enslaved at the time			0
@entity22 himself used the map as he and his generals planned the @entity15 tactics inspiration : a zoomed - in portion of the 1861 map shows the counties along the @entity74 along with their shockingly high proportion of enslaved inhabitants			0
this map was par tof what inspired @entity28 to create his series of maps			0

fascinating maps based on @entity137 census data clearly show the spread of enslaved workers as agriculture pushed ever west
the maps use dating stretching as far back as the first @entity5 census in 1790 and show slavery grew through expansion not intensification
the maps are an example of the first data maps , which appeared in the 19th century
