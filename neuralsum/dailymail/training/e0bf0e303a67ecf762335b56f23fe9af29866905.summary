by @entity0 published : 18:38 est , 8 october 2013 @entity2 : 11:32 est , 19 november 2013 its stock in trade is cut - and - blow - drys rather than @entity7 ginger cake , mops and pineapple chunks			1
but now the net - curtained @entity11 hair salon is ready for a makeover of its own - to turn it back into the setting for stammering , skinflint @entity18 ’s corner shop			2
with @entity20 about to return to our screens after nearly 30 years for a @entity23 special , the end - of - terrace shop is once again to be the setting for the late @entity26 ’s grocery store			1
the salon in the @entity29 suburb of @entity30 , @entity31 , was used as the exterior of the overcrowded , old - fashioned grocery store run by @entity18 and his put - upon assistant @entity34 , played by sir @entity36 , in the original hit series			2
@entity41 used to own the @entity47 salon where exterior shots for @entity20 were filmed front : the hair salon in @entity30 , @entity31 which was used as the exterior of the grocery in the classic comedy - and will be again yesterday @entity41 , 82 , who started the hair salon in 1962 , said she believed the show ’s makers chose her shop back then because its writer @entity59 ’s father used to have a corner shop and @entity59 was local to the area			1
for the series that ran from 1976 to 1985 watched by 17million viewers a week , producers fitted a fake shop sign , stacked tins in the windows and piled vegetables and cooking pots on tables outside as they transformed @entity11 into @entity18 ’s			0
it was there , at the end of each episode , that @entity18 would reflect on the events of the day as he packed his wares away			0
ironically , before mrs @entity41 began her business the shop had actually been a greengrocer - and when she took it over her late husband had to remove lots of tinned goods from the cellar			1
after she retired aged 67 , she passed the shop on to her daughter @entity45 , a hairdresser , who has run it ever since , although the salon now only opens twice a week			2
yesterday mother of two mrs @entity45 said ‘ a man from the @entity95 ’ came to the shop last thursday with regard to filming the one - off @entity23 special there and told her it was ‘ all a bit top secret as they had n’t been given the go ahead yet ’			1
‘ then he rang me last night and said it ’s going ahead			0
it is definitely going to happen in november for about three days , ’ she said			1
transformed : the shop as the famous grocery store where owner @entity18 , played by the late @entity26 , tormented his nephew @entity34 , played by @entity36 in the show that ran from 1976 to 1985 recalling how the salon was first chosen back in the 1970s , mrs @entity41 said : ‘ the producer rang me and asked ‘ could we borrow your shop ? ’ and i said ‘ you ’re joking are n’t you ? ’ , but he said he was n’t			1
‘ he came and met us at the shop and then the rest is history really			0
i ’d like to see another episode filmed , it was good			0
’ she can also clearly remember mingling with stars @entity36 and @entity26 when they were on set			2
‘ i think they came about four of five times , they came once and they were in for three weeks , ’ she said			0
‘ they would come at three weeks at a time and they would pay us to use the shop			2
‘ at one time i was that busy they rented me another shop to do the hairdressing in , just up the road			2
’ in 2006 , the shop was threatened with demolition after council chiefs warned that pre- 1919 housing may have to be demolished in a regeneration drive			0
but luckily for mrs @entity45 - and , as it turns out , @entity20 ’ makers - it survived			1
@entity135 : @entity136 and @entity137 in their shop the @entity140 in @entity141 , @entity142			0
before his death aged 78 last year , @entity143 revealed that @entity26 took inspiration from the shop stars : @entity26 ( left ) pictured in three years before his death in 2002 and sir @entity36 who is to revive his character @entity34 for a @entity151 double act : @entity26 played the tight - fisted , lecherous , lovable shopkeeper @entity18 with @entity36 as his long - suffering nephew and assistant @entity34 @entity20 was an affectionate comedy set in a grocery shop on the corner of a sloping street in a @entity31 town plans for the @entity23 special were announced by the @entity95 earlier this week			1
in it , sir @entity36 will once again play @entity34 , but this time he is in charge after @entity18 has died and passed the son on to his nephew in his will			2
last night a @entity95 source said : ‘ it ’s still early stages and we ’re still planning exactly when and where filming will take place			1
’ meanwhile , a corner shop thought to have inspired the classic tv sitcom @entity20 has long since closed and been turned into a family home			1
@entity179 , which was run by @entity143 in @entity141 , @entity142 , shut for the last time in 1998 after 70 years			1
it was run by his father @entity180 before him			0
before his death aged 78 last year , @entity143 revealed that @entity26 was a frequent customer when the comedian had a holiday cottage six miles away at @entity185			0
‘ i recall him coming to the shop for boiled sweets - bull ’s eyes , if i remember rightly			0
no one realised he was taking away the inspiration for a series as well , ’ he said			0
yesterday his daughter @entity192 said : ‘ @entity26 famously said that he took inspiration from everywhere he went and everything he saw so it is entirely possible @entity196 and his shop were an inspiration			0
