@entity1 scientists believe that @entity3 's largest and deepest underground lake could contain thousands of different tiny organisms and even fish			1
scientists say that the icy darkness of @entity8 , which has been cut off from the outside world for 15 million years under 3,700 metres of ice , provides a glimpse of the planet before the @entity13			2
research from @entity15 , @entity16 , suggests that the lake harbours plenty of life from bacteria to complex organisms			0
not only had most scientists believed @entity8 completely inhospitable to life , some thought it might even be sterile			1
drilling into history : @entity1 researchers have found evidence of bacterial life in ice samples taken from @entity30 after two years of computer analysis of dna sequences from ice samples , the final results showed that @entity8 contains a diverse set of microbes , as well as some multicellular organisms			1
over 3,500 dna sequences were identified in samples of ice ' as clear as diamonds ' extracted from the ice , of which 95 per cent were associated with types of bacteria			1
the remaining five per cent of the samples contained hints of more complex organisms called eukaryokes and two of them were linked to one - called organisms called archaea			0
dr @entity53 , a @entity15 professor of biological sciences and his team found sequences that are similar to types of fungi as well as water fleas , arthropods and a mollusk			0
interestingly come of the bacteria are generally found in fish guts , suggesting that there could be fish in the subterranean lake , according to the research published in the @entity69 journal			0
most scientists believed @entity8 ( pictured from above ) was completely inhospitable to life			1
but new research suggests that it contains a diverse set of microbes , as well as some multicellular organisms ' the bounds of what is habitable and what is not are changing , ' said dr @entity53			0
@entity8 is located 800 miles from the @entity80 and 35 million years ago , when the climate was warmer , was thought to have been open to the air and surrounded by forests			2
the researchers said : ' at that time , the lake probably contained a complex network of organisms			0
' they think that the organisms were sealed in the lake , which is around a quarter of a mile deep , by the thick ice approximately 15 million years ago			2
they said : ' while the current conditions are different than earlier in history , the lake seems to have maintained a surprisingly diverse community of organisms			0
' these organisms may have slowly adapted to the changing conditions in @entity8 during the past 15 to 35 million years when the lake converted from a terrestrial system to a subglacial system			2
' several of the sequences are similar to organisms that live near deep sea thermal vents , leading researchers to believes that @entity8 might contain similar features in its icy depths			1
dr @entity53 of @entity15 found dna sequences that are similar to types of fungi as well as water fleas , arthropods and a mollusk , from ice samples taken from @entity8 ( research station pictured )			1
he believes there could be fish and deep sea thermal vents in the lake ' hydrothermal vents could provide sources of energy and nutrients vital for organisms living in the lake , ' the scientists said			1
@entity131 researchers suggested that a unique form of bacteria had been discovered in water samples from the 15 million year old lake			0
however , their findings were later said to be because of contamination			0
the @entity1 researchers were keen to say that they took great pains to prevent contamination of their samples and said that the various sequences were the type that many scientists expected to see in a subglacial lake			1
' most of the organisms appear to be aquatic ( freshwater ) , and many are species that usually live in ocean or lake sediments , ' dr @entity53 said .			0

@entity1 scientists believe that @entity3 's largest and deepest underground lake could contain thousands of different tiny organisms and even fish
many researchers had thought that the @entity8 , buried *underneath* two miles of ice , was completely inhospitable to life and even sterile
dna sequences from ice samples hint that there could be deep sea thermal vents to provide energy and nutrients vital for organisms living in the lake
