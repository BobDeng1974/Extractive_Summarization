@entity45 reported that leaders of the @entity6 appeared receptive to @entity48 â€™ statements			2
mr @entity9 told the network : ' it 's a dialogue that continues to be difficult for many people			1
but the members of our community are the ones that pay the price , not the organization as a whole			0
' @entity59 , who will not attend the event , said she is not optimistic			0
getting the message out : both mr @entity9 and ms @entity22 have said spoken out in interviews ms @entity22 was honoured for her fight against the @entity6 ' decision on stage at the @entity67 in @entity68 last month			1
mr @entity9 , whose defence of his own lesbian mothers and civil unions before the @entity72 has been viewed on @entity73 more than 2.5 million times , said gay rights advocates are aware of many @entity77 leaders who support change			1
' i think it 's a lot closer than people might expect , ' @entity9 said			1
he added : ' it 's very clear that there 's a lot of support even within the @entity6 ... what we 're trying to do is make sure we give them some real credence so they know that they have external support , that there are a lot people that have their back when it comes to actually changing this policy from a national perspective			1
' but later , the @entity6 indicated it would not be changing its policies			2
@entity0 's honour : mr @entity9 ' defence of his own lesbian mothers and civil unions before @entity11 lawmakers last year has been viewed on @entity73 more than 2.5 million times @entity107 , @entity6 director of public relations , said in a statement to @entity45 : ' @entity6 teaches its members to treat those with different opinions with courtesy and respect at all times			1
' today , scouting officials accepted signatures from an online petition and shared the purpose of its membership policy			0
' the statement went on : ' scouting maintains that is youth development program is not the appropriate environment to introduce or discuss , in any way , same - sex attraction			0
parents and caregivers should have the right to decide when and how to discuss the issue with their children			0
' the @entity6 in 2000 famously won a 5 - 4 @entity136 @entity135 ruling allowing the organization to ban gays whose conduct , the @entity6 argued , violated its values			2
mr @entity9 , his lesbian parents and @entity59 found that local @entity77 leaders and parents accepted them regardless of the parents ' sexual orientation			2
' it was a complete non-issue after people got to know me and know my parents , ' he said			0
ms @entity22 said she was assured by her local cubmaster that her sexual orientation was not a problem and she was even drafted to be den leader			2
celeb backing : among the stars who have signed the petition are chat show host @entity40 , pictured left with partner @entity158 , and singer @entity44 , right however , later , when she became treasurer and pointed out some financial discrepancies in the books , someone told the pastor of the church that chartered her den that she was gay , and the @entity6 dismissed her			1
' the fact is the [ @entity77 ] organization is still run by a lot of older folks who grew up in a time and culture where quite frankly this was not something that was discussed , ' mr @entity9 said			0
on the @entity20 web page hosting @entity59 's petition , supporter @entity174 was one of several former scouts who posted comments critical of the anti-gay stance			0
' it is stuff like this that really demeans all i worked for to become an @entity0 ... i am so grateful for everything the @entity6 taught me and i am proud about being an @entity0 , but this really diminishes everything i accomplished , ' @entity174 wrote			1
the @entity6 is one of the biggest @entity136 youth organizations , claiming some 2.7 million youth members and over 1 million adult volunteers at the end of 2011			0
