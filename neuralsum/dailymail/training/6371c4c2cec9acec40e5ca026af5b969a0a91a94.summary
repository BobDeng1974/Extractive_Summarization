close allies of @entity10 say mrs @entity11 , the surprise choice to replace @entity13 , should take a more aggressive stance and trumpet her predecessor ’s radical school reforms more clearly			1
one @entity18 source said : ‘ i do n’t think there ’s any question that she ’s stumbling			2
she will have to be told			2
’ mrs @entity11 ’s department has been nicknamed ‘ the @entity27 ’ in @entity28 , because of what is perceived as the non-combative nature of the @entity0 and her junior ministers , the source revealed			1
by contrast , @entity28 has a reputation of being male - dominated and some ministries in particular – such as the @entity32 under mr @entity13 – were seen as having an aggressive ‘ macho ’ culture			1
mrs @entity11 has also been dubbed ‘ ms u-turn ’ after reversing her opposition to gay marriage , watering down a list of approved punishments teachers can use against errant pupils and launching a consultation on whether teachers are overworked			1
last night mrs @entity11 , 42 , hit back at the criticism , saying sniping colleagues had little or no understanding of how toxic their attitude was to @entity49 chances in marginal seats such as her own			1
a source close to the @entity0 said she made no apology for ending mr @entity13 ’s ‘ war against all ’			1
mrs @entity11 , who is also minister for women and equalities , believes a more consensual approach stands a better chance of ensuring that mr @entity13 ’s reforms endure			1

other ministers claim mr @entity13 ’s new role as chief whip allows him to interfere in mrs @entity11 ’s work , hampering her ability to carve out her own identity			1
‘ i think it ’s fair to say that @entity13 retains a very strong interest in what is going on in his former department			2
i ’m sure that does n’t help matters , ’ said one			0
a @entity100 spokesman strongly denied that mr @entity10 had been disappointed in her performance			0
‘ that ’s not his view at all , and anyone criticising @entity0 does not speak for him , ’ he said			2
