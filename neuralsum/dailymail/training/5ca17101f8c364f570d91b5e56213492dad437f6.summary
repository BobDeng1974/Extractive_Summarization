spending less than $ 1,000 ( £ 620 ) on an engagement ring ( stock image ) increased the chances that the marriage will last @entity29 professors from @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , surveyed 3,000 adults who had been married at some point during their lives			1
they discovered that participants who spent between $ 2,000 ( £ 1,250 ) and $ 4,000 ( £ 2,500 ) on an engagement ring were 1.3 times more likely to get divorced			1
the ideal cost of an engagement ring is between $ 500 ( £ 310 ) and $ 1,000 ( £ 620 ) because spending any less than this is also linked to higher divorce rates			1
furthermore , the economists found that weddings that cost in excess of $ 20,000 ( £ 12,445 ) were 3.5 times more likely to end in divorce , compared to couples who spent between $ 5,000 ( £ 3,111 ) and $ 10,000 ( £ 6,223 ) on their big day			2

the big day : weddings costing in excess of $ 20,000 ( £ 12,445 ) were 3.5 times more likely to end in divorce			2
the average cost of a wedding in the @entity73 and @entity74 is now around $ 30,000 ( £ 18,668 )			0
debt : a 2013 survey by insurance firm @entity76 revealed that 12 per cent of @entity73 couples have more than £ 3,000 of debt to pay as the result of splashing out on their big day			0
it found that one in eight newlywed couples have sold wedding gifts to try and recoup costs and over half of them think wedding costs are out of control			0
this may be bad news for many couples , because according to figures by @entity93 , the average wedding costs $ 30,000 ( £ 18,668 ) in the @entity74 and almost exactly the same amount in the @entity73			0
a recent survey by insurance firm @entity76 found that one in eight newlywed couples are selling wedding gifts to pay for their nuptials , and more than half of couples think wedding costs have spiralled out of control			0
the economists believe that the link between expensive rings and wedding days , and divorce rates , may be down to the financial stress put upon bride and grooms			2

in contrast , those who spent less than $ 1,000 ( £ 620 ) were up to 93 per cent less likely to be stressed out by the cost of their wedding			1
the economists wrote in the paper : ‘ our findings provide little evidence to support the validity of the wedding industry ’s general message that connects expensive weddings with positive marital outcomes			0
’ they did however find that big weddings are best if done on a shoestring			0
having more guests at a wedding increases the chance of a long marriage , they concluded			0

@entity29 professors from @entity30 surveyed 3,000 adults
participants who spent between $ 2,000 ( £ 1,250 ) and $ 4,000 ( £ 2,500 ) on an engagement ring were 1.3 times more likely to get divorced
but *buying* a cheap ring - less than $ 500 ( £ 310 ) - also saw high divorce rates
spending $ 1,000 ( £ 620 ) or less on a wedding *decreased* the chances of getting divorced - *possibly* because of fewer financial worries
