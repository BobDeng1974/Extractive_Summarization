@entity1 said the 1,100 - kilogram ( 2,425 - pound ) @entity8 satellite , which ran out of fuel in october , re-entered the atmosphere at about 0000 gmt monday			1
it followed a descending orbit that extended across @entity12 , the western @entity13 , the eastern @entity14 and @entity15			1
the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) claims one of its sleek research satellites , dubbed the ' @entity4 of space ' has plummeted somewhere into the @entity6 most of the satellite disintegrated in the high atmosphere , but tracking data from both the @entity22 and @entity23 suggests the surviving debris fell just off the coast of @entity26 , south of the @entity27			1
with a sleek , aerodynamic design responsible for its @entity4 nickname , @entity8 was the first uncontrolled re-entry of a @entity1 ( @entity1 ) satellite since 1987			2
prior to its descend , @entity1 estimated that the chance of an individual being struck by the debris would lower than being hit by a meteorite			0
@entity8 re-entered the atmosphere at about 0000 gmt monday on a descending orbit pass that extended across @entity12 , the western @entity13 , the eastern @entity14 and @entity15 full name : gravity field and steady - state @entity41 launched : 17 march 2009 launcher : rockot ( with @entity47 upper stage ) by @entity48 launch site : @entity50 , @entity51 nominal life : 20 months cost : $ 466million orbit : about 161.5 miles altitude , polar , @entity55 - synchronous mass : 2,000lbs dimensions : 17.4 feet long , about 3.3 foot body diameter propulsion tank : 88.2lbs of xenon gas mission : measuring @entity63 's gravity field and modelling the geoid with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) had been orbiting @entity63 since march 2009 at the lowest altitude of any research satellite			1
it 's been gradually descending over the last three weeks after running out of fuel october 21			1
@entity1 says its information is now being used to understand ocean circulation , sea level , ice dynamics and the @entity63 's interior			1
during its mission , it has produced a unique model of the ‘ geoid ’ , which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another			0
@entity8 ’s ion engine , responsible for keeping the satellite at an incredibly low orbit of under 260 km , together with its accelerometer measurements have also provided new insight into air density and wind speeds in the upper atmosphere			2
an international campaign involving the @entity91 and @entity1 ’s @entity92 monitored the reentry			0
the above illustration shows key features of @entity1 's @entity8 satellite which disintegrated in the atmosphere in the early hours of this morning			1
around 25 per cent of the satellite is thought to have plummeted into the @entity6 tracking data from both the @entity22 and @entity23 suggests the surviving debris fell just off the coast of @entity26 , south of the @entity27 ' the one - tonne goce satellite is only a small fraction of the 100 – 150 tonnes of man - made space objects that reenter @entity63 ’s atmosphere annually , ” said @entity106 , head of @entity1 ’s @entity92			1
' in the 56 years of spaceflight , some 15 000 tonnes of man - made space objects have reentered the atmosphere without causing a single human injury to date			0
' under @entity116 ’s @entity115 created in september of 1972 , should a space fragment cause damage upon re-entry , the country that launched the satellite would be held accountable , @entity117 reported			0
the treaty , which has been ratified by 88 countries as of january 2013 , guarantees that the state responsible will pay compensation			0
in the case of @entity8 , the satellite was launched from @entity51 , so that country would be on the hook for any damage			2
during its mission , @entity8 has produced a unique model of the geoid , which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another			0

@entity8 was launched in 2009 to map *variations* in @entity63 's gravity
it ran out of xenon fuel october 21 and had been losing altitude since
the satellite broke through @entity63 's atmosphere at around *midnight*
it descended across the @entity13 , the @entity14 and @entity15
data suggests surviving debris fell into the @entity6 , just off the tip of @entity26 , south of the @entity27
