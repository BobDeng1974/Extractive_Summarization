the moves came in response to the police shooting of @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			2
@entity1 called the get - together ' a historic meeting that the president and vice president sat with all of us and law enforcement to commit to not just another commitment , another study ... but that he would put his full weight behind it			1
' ' we live in a country that we must support law enforcement but law enforcement must support justice , ' he said			2
in a brief statement to the press , @entity0 said that the @entity14 shooting in @entity15 ' laid bare a problem that is not unique to @entity35 ... and that is a simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color			1
' ' he cited civil rights leaders ' opinion ' that in a country where one of our basic principles , perhaps the most important principle , is equality under the law , that too many individuals – particularly young people of color – do not feel as if they 're being treated fairly			1
the @entity2 said in august that it agreed with the idea in principle			0
' we support the use of cameras and video technology by law enforcement officers , and the @entity92 continues to research best practices for implementation , ' the administration wrote in response to a public petition that attracted more than 154,000 supporters on the @entity2 website			2
the new initiative will provide 50 per cent of the funding for cameras , but will not pay for them entirely , at a cost of $ 75 million			0
it will also provide new training resources and funds to study how to reform police practices			0
it 's unclear why officer @entity109 did n't wear a camera during his fateful encounter with @entity14			2

' @entity0 – meeting with @entity1 is n't what 's going to change conditions			1
those days are long gone , ' she wrote			0
paramilitary : police in the war - torn @entity16 suburb of @entity15 , like many local forces large and small , participates in a federal program that arms them with surplus battlefield weapons , armor and combat vehicles @entity16 lt. gov @entity167 said monday morning on the @entity168 that @entity1 ' is an inciter of mobs and he demands mob justice			1
' the @entity118 program that supplies military equipment to police forces has moved more than $ 5.1 billion in gear – including guns , tactical vehicles and even aircraft – since its inception			1
about $ 500 million in hardware was passed out this year alone			0
but @entity2 press secretary @entity181 explained during a briefing monday that ' the ‘ majority of the funds ’ spent through those programs ‘ has not been used to purchase law enforcement specific equipment ’			1

@entity181 told reporters that the program should be tweaked to ' enhance crime prevention while at the same time strengthening the bonds with the communities they are sworn to protect			0
' he said the president had no plans to visit @entity15 personally but had n't ruled it out			0
black communities , especially in @entity15 , have complained that the federal government is arming their local police to the point where they more resemble paramilitary armies than law enforcement agencies			1

@entity16 gov. @entity214 was criticized later for not deploying the @entity215 , a fully militarized force , in downtown @entity15			0
@entity0 said during an august 18 press conference that it would be ' useful for us to review how the funding was done , how local law enforcement has used grant dollars , to make sure that what they 're purchasing is stuff that they actually need			1
' ' there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement , and we do n't want those lines blurred			2
that would be contrary to our tradition , ' he said then			0
@entity181 said monday that the president would appoint a new task force , led by @entity238 police commissioner @entity237 and former assistant attorney general @entity239 , to study what the @entity2 has called ' best practices ' in policing			1

' but it did not respond to a request for information about who else , other than @entity1 , would attend its civil rights meeting			1
the @entity271 reported that @entity0 's meeting with the civil rights community would focus on challenges posed by ' mistrust between law enforcement and communities of color			1
' that topic was a major point of emphasis when the president addressed the nation one week ago as @entity15 burned			0
' the fact is , in too many parts of this country , a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color , ' @entity0 said on nov. 24			1
' some of this is the result of the legacy of racial discrimination in this country			0
and this is tragic , because nobody needs good policing more than poor communities with higher crime rates			0
' ' the good news is we know there are things we can do to help , ' he added			0
' and i 've instructed attorney general [ eric ] holder to work with cities across the country to help build better relations between communities and law enforcement			2

@entity109 resigned his post over the weekend			0
@entity0 's cabinet meeting concerned ' federal programs and funding that provide equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies , ' according to the @entity2			1
