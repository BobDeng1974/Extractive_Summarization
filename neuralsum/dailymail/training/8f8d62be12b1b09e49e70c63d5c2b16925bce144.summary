a shipwrecked fisherman who miraculously survived in the @entity1 by clinging to a foam icebox for two days has revealed how he was just minutes from drowning when he was rescued			1
father - of - five @entity3 was plucked from the water in a ' terrible ' state by the @entity7 @entity6 some 20 miles off the coast after his small fishing boat capsized			1
he spent the two freezing nights clutching the cover of a @entity13 drinks cooler after deciding not to take lifejackets apparently because they were deemed too expensive and unnecessary			1
speaking to @entity15 while recovering at home in his fishing village of @entity18 , mr @entity3 says his entire body aches and still feels seasick , but is thrilled to be alive			1
' i was about to die , ' he said			0
' i could n't hold out any longer			0
by 1am on saturday , mr @entity3 and mr @entity34 hauled up their nets and filled the ice box with red snapper			2
but then the 22ft - long fibreglass boat began filling with water due to high waves and , possibly , a leak			1
the two men tried to bail out the water , but it came in even faster and the boat sagged to one side			2
they tried to jerry - rig a sail out of a tarp to catch the wind and right the boat , but it was too late			2
mr @entity3 had bothered to take a lifejacket because he felt he was a very good swimmer			2
@entity63 , another fisherman from @entity64 , also said hardly anyone in the village owns a lifejacket because they are expensive and – when all goes well - unnecessary			1
instead , mr @entity3 grabbed the cover of the @entity13 ice box , broke in in two , gave one piece to mr @entity34 and clung to the other			2
incredible : video footage released by the @entity7 @entity6 captures the exact moment sailors spotted mr @entity3 floating in the open ocean tied to the buoyant icebox the sailors manoeuvred their warship towards mr @entity3 before a diver jumped overboard to save him he also removed his belt and , with a flashlight , fashioned himself a headlamp			1
then the boat went down			0
at that time , they were only a few miles off the coast but , in the dark , they could n't get their bearings to swim in the right direction			0
by sunrise on saturday , they realised they were going the wrong way			0
' the current kept taking us farther out to sea , ' @entity3 said			1
' we could no longer see the shore			0
we were both swimming and both getting tired			0
' the @entity7 @entity6 has an emergency telephone line for such cases			1
its vessels are constantly patrolling the @entity104 often in search of drug traffickers who move cocaine to @entity108 and @entity109 in fast boats and even homemade submarines			0
this coastal region is remote and nearly road-less thus people get around on ferries , speed boats and canoes			0
incident : mr @entity3 , 47 , and a friend set sail from the town of @entity38 in the south of the country on friday , but two days later strong winds caused their vessel to overturn 21 miles from the coast lucky : mr @entity3 was rushed back to short and taken to hospital , but despite his near - death ordeal , was found to be suffering from nothing but dehydration			1
he is expected to make a full recovery when motors break down or vessels run aground , the @entity6 is often called in to pick up marooned passengers			2
but mr @entity3 and mr @entity34 had told family members that they expected to return home late sunday , so no - one in @entity18 thought to call the @entity6 's rescue line			1
by sunday morning , with mr @entity34 growing weaker , the two men drifted apart and mr @entity3 lost track of his fishing partner			2
now 22 nautical miles off shore , he prepared for the end			0
' my life was nothing , ' mr @entity3 said			2
' what mattered to me was my family '			0
by sheer coincidence , the @entity7 @entity6 's @entity148 corvette was at that moment plowing through the sea nearby			1
just before midday , the ship 's spotters , who are on deck 24 hours a day , in part , to avoid accidents with tiny fishing boats , spied something suspicious floating in the water			2
@entity3 saw the @entity6 vessel and started yelling			1
' the ship was not on a mission to look for him , ' says lt. @entity162 , a @entity6 press officer			1
' it was out patrolling , doing normal operations like looking for drug boats			0
it was almost a miracle that we found him			0
' incredible video footage released by the @entity7 @entity6 captures the exact moment sailors spotted mr @entity3 floating in the open ocean			1
miraculous : @entity3 , 47 , survived two nights in the open ocean by clinging to a @entity13 icebox sailors tossed him a flotation device , but by that point he was too weak to swim for it			1
a navy diver jumped in to help the bedraggled castaway who was still grasping the ice box cover			0
clad in a t - shirt , green short and his homemade headlamp , the exhausted survivor was hoisted aboard on a stretcher			0
' he was in terrible condition , ' said captain @entity186 , the ship 's commander			2
' we got there just in time			0
' @entity3 was taken to a @entity6 hospital and treated for dehydration and sunburn			1
then , he caught a boat back to @entity18 where villagers had no idea he 'd almost died			0
it was a bittersweet homecoming because @entity34 is still missing			0
@entity3 , who is taking antibiotics , remains weak but is expected to recover			0
' fishing is his life , ' said lt. @entity162 , of the by - the - book @entity6 , who frowns at @entity3 's disregard for safety but marvels at his resourcefulness			1
' he is a sea wolf			0
' @entity3 's story has captivated @entity7 where maritime lore is rife with miraculous tales of survival			1
the most famous incident involved the sinking of a @entity6 ship overloaded with contraband and its sole survivor , a sailor who climbed aboard a life raft then fought off thirst , sharks and the blazing sun for the next 10 days			1
published in 1955 in daily newspaper installments , ' @entity218 ' was written by an aspiring @entity7 novelist named @entity221 .			0
