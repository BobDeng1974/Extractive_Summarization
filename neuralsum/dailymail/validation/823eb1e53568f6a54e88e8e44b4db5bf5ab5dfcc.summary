a couple accused of claiming £ 42,500 in benefits while sending their children to a top private school and living in a £ 1,950 a month house were cleared today			1
judge @entity6 threw out the case against @entity8 and @entity9 because the @entity10 lost letters written by mr @entity12 that would have supported his case			1
the 67 - year - old from @entity15 insisted he had written to the @entity10 notifying them of a change in his financial circumstances			0
during the trial the government department denied ever receiving these letters but in evidence yesterday @entity23 , a @entity10 investigator , conceded there was a computer record of letters being received from him			1
cleared : @entity9 and @entity12 were accused of claiming £ 42,000 of benefits while getting an income from businesses and £ 50,000 in the bank - but the @entity10 lost a series of important letters , collapsing the case she said they could not be accessed to check their contents because they had been ‘ archived ’ and were not longer retrievable			1
judge @entity6 ruled that because the prosecution was unable to produce the letters to show whether they contained what mr @entity12 alleged it would be unsafe to leave the case to the jury			1
he directed the jury to find the couple not guilty of defrauding the @entity10 between 2009 and 2011			2
the couple had been accused of falsely claiming £ 42,500 , consisting of £ 19,000 of pension benefit , £ 19,000 of housing benefit and £ 4,500 of council tax benefit to fund their lifestyle			1
@entity9 , also received a £ 40,000 payment from her parents and was drawing income as a director of three companies during the time she and husband @entity8 , 67 , were claiming benefits , @entity53 heard			1
mr and mrs @entity9 say they were penniless as a number of businesses went bust and needed state support			1
this was received while mrs @entity9 got money from her mum , there was income from the pair 's businesses and business account were being used for personal expenditure , it was said			2
prosecutors also say they had around £ 50,000 in the bank , but today a second forensic accountant told the court she felt that the @entity79 had no income entering their bank accounts			2
mr @entity12 , 67 , had been receiving pension credit since november 2007 , despite running his wife 's companies , @entity84 , @entity86 and @entity87 , prosecutors claim			1
funds were used to sent their children to @entity90 in @entity15 , @entity91 , and to pay for expensive child care and high rent			0
investigations into their affairs began when questions were raised about how they were able to pay £ 1,950 a month rent with just £ 775 a month housing allowance			2
mrs @entity9 was questioned by benefit officials in may 2010 and said that her parents had paid the rent shortfalls and school fees			1
top private school : the @entity79 ' children attended £ 32,000 - a - year @entity90 in @entity15 while the couple was claiming benefits , the court heard the couple , from @entity15 , claim that the firms they were involved in at the time were in liquidation			1
on wednesday a forensic accountant told the court that after analysing the pair 's bank accounts it was clear they had more than £ 48,000 available to them			2
@entity119 explained that between them the pair had four bank accounts and his job was to analyse the accounts to decide what was ' personal ' income and what related to the business			0
he told the jury that he assessed each payment made and even went through nine ring binders full of receipts to try and ascertain where cash had been spent			0
in his report he also asked : ' what is income ? luxury items such as school fees , extravagant holidays , expensive purchases , nice clothes , could all mean an income			1
' if you 're spending on these things there must be a source to do it '			0
he told that £ 40,000 of that had come from mrs @entity9 's mother			1
the defence argued that it therefore counted as a gift , but when prosecutor , @entity152 , asked the witness : ' would a gift of £ 40,000 be eligible for pension credit ? ' he responded : ' i believe so '			2
mr and mrs @entity9 both deny falsely claiming pension credits and housing and council tax benefit without declaring they had other income			1
but defence witness @entity163 - a forensic accountant - said the couple were clearly struggling with money as a number of their businesses went under			0
she explained how @entity169 , a coffee shop opened in @entity171 and @entity172 , was hoped to become a chain but it collapsed shortly after opening			0
instead the pair opened a restaurant called @entity177 in @entity15			0
the couple also opened @entity179 , a company aimed at running fast food outlets which ran for just two months			0
the couple 's building companies , @entity84 and @entity86 also went into liquidation			0
hearing : judge @entity6 threw out the case at @entity53 ( above ) after a @entity10 blunder mrs @entity163 also argued that the £ 40,000 given to @entity9 by her mother was clearly a loan and did not count as income			1
she said : ' they were struggling			0
they were doing their best to make things work			0
they had a number of businesses and they had become accustomed to a certain lifestyle			0
' their businesses went under but they were trying to maintain that level of living			0
' it took them about a year to try and get back on their feet financially			0
' i do n't believe they were receiving any income			0
i understood the money to be a short term loan from mrs @entity9 's mother to get her back on her feet			2
