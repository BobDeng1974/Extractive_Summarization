in the image the militant is seen wearing camouflage gear as he proudly brandishes the weapon on a shopping street			0
he is understood to have been killed alongside two @entity21 jihadis during fierce clashes in the @entity14 desert town of @entity24			1
he is just the latest in a steady flow of @entity4 militants to be killed fighting for @entity13 in the @entity27 - a figure that has grown dramatically towards the end of the year as @entity31 - led airstrikes target the group 's strongholds and @entity35 and @entity36 forces retake land from the terrorists			1
today it was revealed that @entity31 - led air strikes in @entity14 and @entity41 have killed more than 1,000 jihadis in the past three months , nearly all of them from the @entity44			1
' at least 1,171 have been killed in the @entity46 and international air strikes [ since september 23 ] , including 1,119 jihadists of the @entity44 group and @entity49 , ' said the @entity50 , which relies on a network of activists and medics across the war - ravaged country for its information			0
among the dead were 1,046 members of @entity59 , which has seized large chunks of @entity41 and @entity14 and is the main target of the air campaign			2
seventy - two of those killed were members of @entity67 's branch in @entity14 , the @entity49 , while another was a jihadist prisoner whose affiliation was unknown , an @entity50 statement said			0
the remaining 52 were civilians			0
@entity1 's death was announced on social media by a fighter of @entity75 origin who goes by the @entity76 and who claims to have trained alongside the militant in @entity14			2
he said the @entity12 was killed in @entity24 alongside two militants of @entity21 origin named @entity81 & @entity82			2
@entity13 supporters on social media raised the possibility that the pair could be @entity89 - raised brothers @entity87 and @entity90 , who joined @entity13 in august having only recently converted to @entity91			0
details of @entity1 's true identity are not known and reports of his death could not be independently verified			0
the @entity96 said it was aware of reports of the death of a @entity4 national , but could not confirm their legitimacy due to the lack of consular presence in @entity14			2
he is just the latest in a long line of @entity4 killed fighting for @entity13 in @entity14 and @entity41 in recent months - many of them having travelled to join the group after its declaration of a so - called caliphate in the vast swaths of territory it controls , and @entity113 's self - appointment as a caliph			1
claim : @entity1 's death was announced on social media by @entity116 , who said the @entity12 was killed alongside two @entity21 jihadis during fierce clashes in the @entity14 town of @entity24 reunion : @entity116 claims to have trained alongside the dead @entity4 militant in @entity14 @entity11 was killed in @entity24 alongside two militants of @entity21 origin named @entity81 & @entity82			1
@entity13 supporters on social media raised the possibility that the pair could be @entity89 - raised brothers @entity87 ( left ) and @entity90 ( right ) @entity127 , who joined @entity13 earlier this year @entity21 's @entity90 bothers ( @entity87 pictured ) joined @entity13 in august having only recently converted to @entity91 @entity1 was killed in @entity24 alongside two militants of @entity21 origin named @entity81 & @entity82 - @entity128 the number of @entity4 deaths has risen dramatically towards the end of the year , as the fighter 's naive expectations of @entity135 - style warfare are replaced by the brutal reality of fierce battles with the group 's enemies : @entity67 - affiliated @entity49 , the @entity140 , @entity14 and @entity41 regime armies , @entity142 tribes , @entity144 militias , and a number of other rebel groups in the area			1
their fight is made even harder by near constant airstrikes from warplanes sent by the @entity31 and its @entity46 allies in @entity14 ; and from @entity31 , @entity153 , @entity21 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and of course @entity4 itself in neighbouring @entity41			1
the greatest number of @entity4 killed fighting for @entity13 , however , have been killed in street battles with @entity35 and @entity36 troops , who have been making huge gains in northern @entity14 and western @entity41 since september , having lost vast swaths of territory to @entity13 earlier in the year			1
in recent weeks there have been a number of reports of @entity4 militants expressing their desire to return to @entity4 having grown disillusioned with the reality of fighting for @entity13			1
professor @entity170 from @entity172 's @entity171 for the @entity173 says he was contacted by a man representing a group of up to 30 @entity4 militants , all of whom wanted to return to the @entity4 but were worried about being arrested on their return			0
he believes as many as a fifth of @entity4 fighters in the country could be trying to find a way out of their current situation and claimed less - hardened jihadists could be used to show would - be recruits that the reality of battle may not match the image presented by @entity13 propaganda			2

the @entity225 says over 550 individuals of interest to the security services have travelled to the region from the @entity4 since the start of the conflict			0

dead : @entity261 is one of the last images of @entity236 , a @entity4 national who died fighting in @entity14 last year relaxed : briton @entity264 ( white shirt ) was seen pointing up the sky while posing for photos moments before driving a truck full of explosives into a prison killing himself and many others in february in october it emerged that a fourth man from @entity208 , @entity274 - @entity273 , 19 - had died fighting in @entity201 , the scene of fierce fighting between @entity277 and @entity13			1
three others from the same city - @entity279 , 23 , @entity281 , 24 , and @entity204 , 25 - have also been killed after travelling there in october 2013			0

anger : in recent weeks three @entity4 men of @entity296 descent are known to have died fighting for @entity13			2
they include @entity297 ( left ) who previously featured in a chilling @entity13 propaganda video filmed in @entity300 , and @entity301 as - @entity302 ( right ) names of other @entity4 nationals known to have died in @entity14 include @entity264 - a 41 - year - old suicide bomber from @entity305 ; @entity209 - a 30 - year - old father of three from @entity210 who blew himself up in july ; and @entity308 and @entity309 , whose names are known but whose life and death details remain clouded in speculation			1
in recent weeks three @entity4 men of @entity296 descent are known to have died fighting for @entity316 , @entity301 as - @entity302 , and @entity317 as - @entity302			2
all three are understood to have been killed fighting in @entity14 , with @entity297 having previously featured in a chilling @entity13 propaganda video filmed in @entity300			1
while the escalation in deaths of @entity4 nationals fighting for @entity13 may way put off some would - be jihadis joining the terror group , it may not have quite the impact many would expect			1
fingers raised : the third @entity4 man of @entity296 descent killed fighting for @entity13 is @entity317 as - @entity302 ( pictured left alongside the aforementioned @entity297 the fear is that the deaths may actually attract more would - be jihadis to join @entity13 , as young @entity332 are sucked into the warped romance of martyrdom in the name of religion			1
those killed are referred to my their jihadist friends as ' green birds ' in reference to passages in the @entity343 that talks about martyrs living in the hearts of green birds in paradise			0
in fact references to green birds are so prevalent among @entity91 extremists that the easily influenced claim to pray for death to come quickly to hasten their arrival in the afterlife			0
a @entity225 spokesperson said : ' the @entity4 advises against all travel to @entity14 and parts of @entity41			2
anyone who does travel to these areas , even for humanitarian reasons , is putting themselves in considerable danger of harm			0
' ' the best way for the public to help is to donate to or otherwise support @entity4 - registered charities that have ongoing relief operations			0
