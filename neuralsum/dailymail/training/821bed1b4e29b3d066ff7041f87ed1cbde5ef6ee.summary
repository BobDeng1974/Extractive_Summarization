a hairdresser has had one of her fingers amputated after a bite from a false widow spider led to her catching a flesh - eating bug			1
@entity6 was told she was just hours away from death after she was bitten on her left hand while playing outside with her children in @entity10 , @entity11			1
the 44 - year - old had assumed it was just an insect bite , but within hours it had doubled in size			1
within hours the bite had doubled in size			1
she was left in agonising pain and soon the bite began to leak black pus , the @entity23 reports			1
the mother - of - four rushed to @entity27 where she was kept for six weeks as doctors battled to remove the poison from her system			2
she said : ' you could see the poison tracking up the vein in my arm , the veins were changing colour , it was like something out of a horror film			2
' the doctors told me it was a spider bite because they could see two fang marks			1
they said if i ’d gone to hospital a couple of hours later the poison would have reached my heart and i ’d be a goner			1
' she was later ­ diagnosed with the flesh - eating disease necrotising fasciitis , which medics said had been caused by the insect bite			1
ms @entity6 underwent 14 operations on her finger but eventually it had to be amputated			1

ms @entity6 shows off her post-amputation hand just a scar is left where ms @entity6 's finger used to be after doctors decided to amputate the putrid digit ms @entity6 at home with her sons @entity64 , four , and @entity65 , ten they 've inspired terror into millions , sparking complaints that their danger has been over-hyped			1
so what are false widow spiders ? much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow , which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children , ill or elderly people			1
although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow ( above ) is not known to have caused any deaths in @entity82			0
by comparison , around four @entity82 each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction			0
false widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny , black flesh , bulbous bodies , thick legs and skull - like patterns			2
millions of false widows , @entity82 's most venomous spider , are found across the @entity82 and the population is growing			0
also known by its @entity99 name @entity98 , its first @entity82 sighting was in @entity100 , @entity101 , in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern @entity102			0
but the @entity103 says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north , a theory backed by wildlife sightings			0

as @entity82 's most venomous spider species , false widows made headlines last year when victims told how they had suffered huge wounds and almost lost limbs			0
an entire secondary school was shut in october last year in the @entity124 , @entity125 , after an outbreak of the arachnids in its @entity129 block had to be fumigated			0
in the worst cases , suspected bite victims have been treated in hospital or complained of ongoing health problems several months later			2
but many experts insist the spiders are not particularly dangerous and will only bite if approached or handled			2
there have been no reported deaths from the spiders in @entity82 , where they are believed to have arrived on crates of fruit from the @entity142 in the 1870s			0
it is thought many of the worst reactions happen when bites become infected , rather than being linked to the spider 's venom itself			0
