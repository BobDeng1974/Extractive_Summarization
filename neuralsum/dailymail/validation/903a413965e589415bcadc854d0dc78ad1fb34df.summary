there 's no doubt @entity2 has been the darling of @entity4 this season			1
the brunette reality star - turned - supermodel has been spotted at @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and every glitzy fashion party thrown			1
and always wearing a pair of towering heels			1
the 19 - year - old catwalk star has picked up a few tricks to surviving all night ( and day ) in uncomfortably high heels on her travels around the world 's red carpets , and now she 's sharing them with us			1
but clearly @entity2 took one look and decided she was going to rock it herself to the after party			2
and while the half - sisters have very different body shapes they both looked gorgeous in this vampish ensemble			2
it looks like a dress but is a top and skirt and we love the ruffles and slightly @entity58 vibe			0
and of course if you want to add an element of luxury to your look then velvet is a surefire way to do it			0
this mini looks great with bare legs and high heel sandals but worked just as well with opaque black tights on @entity36			0
but we do have to say we love the addition of the belt by ms @entity71			0
it really accentuates her tiny waist			0
@entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 have all got velvet dresses that will give you @entity2 's look for less			2
so then the only question is , who wore it best ? @entity75 velvet dress ( now reduced to $ 44 ) visit site missguided velvet dress visit site @entity89 midi dress visit site boohoo velvet mesh sleeve dress visit site speaking to @entity93 , @entity2 revealed that her top trick is to distribute the pressure of the heels by alternating her weight on each foot			1
' i switch off from one foot to another a lot , like this			0
[ she crosses one foot behind the other in her now - signature pose			0
] ' @entity2 went on to explain : ' you have to keep moving your feet ! ' although this seems rather counter-intuitive , the point is to never keep the pressure on the ball of one foot for too long , but rather to regularly shift the weight to alleviate the pain			1
the model sported lower heels for the recent @entity117 show , but her top tip works for all heel heights after the show comes the after - party ! @entity2 still sporting sky - high heels after the @entity9 show with bff @entity126 in the interview , @entity2 also went on to reveal a physical attribute that makes heel - wearing even more painful			1
' i have the longest toes in the world ; they 're spider toes			0
