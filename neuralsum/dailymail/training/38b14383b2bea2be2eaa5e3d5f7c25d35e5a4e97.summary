by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , 35 , a firearms officer with the @entity3 , has been awarded £ 37,000 after suffering race and sexual discrimination @entity7 leaked information about the arrest of a glamorous firearms officer in a bid to ' deflect ' negative publicity surrounding her discrimination case , it has been found			1
@entity2 , 35 , won a racial and sexual discrimination case against the @entity17 force in july this year , after judges ruled she had been ' bullied ' while serving in the @entity3 ’s 700 - strong @entity19			1
today , mrs @entity2 received £ 37,000 in damages after the tribunal branded the treatment of police chiefs towards the officer as ‘ malicious , insulting and oppressive ’			1
the force was heavily criticised for releasing details of @entity27 ’s arrest and suspension from duty over an unrelated dispute with her ex-husband			1
tribunal judges found the force had leaked the information as a way to ' deflect attention ' and to ' portray her in a negative light ' , once the tribunal had found in her favour			1
the force was also accused of deliberately deleting findings of discrimination from internal reviews			1
and mrs @entity2 was awarded an extra £ 10,000 over the fact the @entity3 's commissioner sir @entity45 had failed to issue an apology to the officer since the ruling			1
after the hearing , mrs @entity2 , from @entity49 , @entity50 , said she was glad the tribunal had recognised the force 's ' dirty tricks ' to ' smear ' her name , but said that no amount of compensation could make up for what she had been through			1
she said : ' today is not a day for celebration			0
i have been put through a two - year ordeal in which i have been bullied , harassed and victimised simply because of my gender and race			0
' no amount of compensation will ever make up for the hurt and upset that i have been caused			2
' since i won my initial hearing , the @entity3 has failed to apologise to me or express any regret at the treatment i received			2
the only reaction from the police was to smear my name by releasing misleading details of my arrests			0
' i am glad that the tribunal recognised that this leak of information was a dirty trick by the @entity3 aimed solely at deflecting criticism from itself while simultaneously seriously damaging my reputation			2
' the arrests were , i believe , also motivated by revenge simply because i made a stand against police bullying			0
even today i am still having to fight to clear my name , in this regard , as part of this ongoing nightmare			0
' @entity27 , who was one of just two black officers in the protection group , was discriminated against for being a black woman by her boss , acting inspector @entity93 , the tribunal found			0
judges were highly critical of the way the @entity3 dealt with the case and called for the force 's internal @entity99 scheme to be overhauled			1
she continued : ' i did not willingly seek this employment tribunal but had no other option to pursue it after various attempts to resolve the situation internally with the police proved fruitless			0
' i worked extremely hard to become a firearms officer in the @entity19 , was proud of my job and always gave 100 %			2
' it saddens me that i found myself in this position through no fault of my own but i do hope that lessons can be learned from my case which will allow more officers , suffering similar discriminatory treatment , to come forward			0
' @entity7 faced a barrage of negative media coverage over the case in july			1
speaking outside court , mrs @entity2 said she was glad the judges had recognised the force 's ' dirty tricks ' but that no amount of compensation could begin to make up for the two - year ordeal the panel found that , while the force did not name @entity27 , a draft press statement was altered to include more detail about her three arrests linked to a domestic dispute with her estranged husband			1
the judges said : ' the respondent had received a lot of negative publicity and had been heavily criticised in the media as a result of the tribunal 's judgment in favour of the claimant			2
' we have no doubt that the second statement was issued to deflect attention and criticism from the respondent and to portray the claimant in a negative light			1
' @entity27 's solicitor @entity166 , senior employment lawyer at @entity167 , said : ' we are delighted with the tribunal 's recognition that pc @entity2 experienced an extremely distressing and humiliating time throughout more than a year of discrimination against her			2
the @entity17 force was blasted by tribunal judges for being ‘ malicious , insulting and oppressive ’ and deliberately deleting findings of discrimination from internal reviews ' the fact the @entity3 did not issue a public apology following the tribunal 's decision only exacerbated the hurt and distress felt by our client			1
this was reflected in the award for aggravated damages and a top award for injury to feelings			0
' we now sincerely hope the tribunal 's recommendations are implemented as soon as possible , as set out in the tribunal 's judgement			0
' in particular , we welcome recommendations there be an independent review of previous discrimination complaints brought by its own officers against the @entity3 and also an independent inquiry into how the @entity3 looks into future discrimination allegations			2
judges also criticised commissioner sir @entity45 for failing to express any regret or to apologise for the way @entity27 had been treated ' the tribunal 's powers to make these wide recommendations is currently under threat from a change in the law			2
the @entity212 will see these tribunal powers removed in future and we will be writing to the @entity215 shortly to ask that this power be retained			0
' the power to recommend significant changes is clearly so important in cases such as this where there have been findings of discrimination with potential wide spread consequences			0
' @entity27 , who is currently on sick leave , was thrust into the spotlight in 2012 when the @entity3 chose her to be a poster girl for a magazine feature on the 10,000 men and women on duty during the @entity233			1
she brought a claim of discrimination against the @entity3 which was upheld earlier this year			0
she told the @entity17 hearing that she was subjected to sexual and racial discrimination , for which she was awarded aggravated damages			0
her award included £ 25,000 for injury to feelings , £ 10,000 for aggravated damages , £ 350 for the financial loss of not being able to do overtime while she was off sick with stress and depression , a 5 per cent increase of £ 1,767.50 for delays in dealing with the case , and £ 282.97 interest			1
at the end of the employment tribunal , judges found mrs @entity2 had been ' singled out and targeted ' for almost a year by a senior officer			1
the case also revealed a practice where advisers involved in the internal fairness at work complaints process were not allowed to record findings of discrimination			2
a report had references to discrimination removed over concerns it would be used in a tribunal , and two other cases were cited where similar material was deleted			0
the system is now under review			0
after she won the hearing , it emerged that mrs @entity2 had been held twice by @entity275 - once last year and once in january this year			1
she was also arrested by @entity7 for alleged assault in april this year			0
mrs @entity2 has been told that she will face no further action over the arrest by the @entity3			1
in relation to the arrests by @entity275 police , a file is currently with prosecutors who are considering whether to bring charges .			0
