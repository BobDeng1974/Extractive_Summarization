by @entity0 earlier this week it was reported @entity2 allegedly shelled out for her own rock following a proposal from her ex-gladiator boyfriend , @entity5			2
and while getting engaged is meant to be one of - if not the - most romantic moments of a woman ’s life , it seems ms @entity2 is part of a growing trend			1
increasing numbers of women are apparently just as concerned with the quality of the ring as the proposal itself with one in five ( 21 per cent ) having purchased their own bling			2
@entity2 may have paid for her own engagement ring following @entity5 's proposal , according to reports it seems purchasing jewellery to celebrate an engagement is no longer seen as the sole responsibility of the husband - to - be , but instead something which should be shared between couples			1
over half of the @entity32 ’s unmarried ladies ( 54 per cent ) said they would willingly contribute – no doubt to ease what is increasingly seen as a financial burden in addition to the actual wedding itself			1
in line with more traditional values , those over the age of 55 years ( 65 per cent ) would be less willing to pay for a ring , but for the younger , unmarried audience ( 18 - 24 years ) it ’s not something they ’re opposed to – a quarter do n’t see it as a problem			1
one in five women ( 6 million @entity32 females ) now pay for their own engagement ring purchasing a ring is no longer seen as the sole responsibility of man , but instead something which should be shared between couples and for the slightly older bracket ( 35 - 44 years ) - in particular those who ’ve not yet been down the aisle - a third would happily pay for their own sparkler			1
@entity60 – 43 % 2			2

@entity62 – 37 % 4			0
@entity63 – 33 % 5			0
@entity64 – 32 % 6			0
@entity65 – 31 % 7			0
@entity66 – 27 % 8			0
@entity67 – 25 % 9			0
@entity68 – 24 % commenting on the findings , @entity70 , @entity71 at @entity72 , who conducted the survey , said : ‘ we live in a modern world where women today are making their own money			0
‘ it 's no longer a man 's stressful responsibility to choose the perfect ring and pay for it alone – these findings show ladies are more than happy to contribute and actually enjoy the selection process			1
' why risk so much money on something they may not even like ! ' if a man still feels he wants a traditional proposal – down on one knee with a ring on offer – why not choose a replica version first that looks the real deal but wo n't break the bank and then have the fun of shopping together for the official one			1

over half of @entity32 single ladies would be willing to contribute to ring
less of those over 55 willing to break with tradition
a third of 35 - 44 year olds say they would be happy to pay for their own ring
