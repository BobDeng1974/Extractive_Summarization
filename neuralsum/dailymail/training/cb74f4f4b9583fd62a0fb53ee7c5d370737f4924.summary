by @entity0 the secret waiting list scandal that led to a national focus on the problems plaguing the @entity6 administration is ' just the tip of the iceberg , ' @entity2 senator @entity1 said today in issuing a report on the department 's history of misconduct			1
' this report shows the problems at the @entity6 are worse than anyone imagined , ' @entity1 said in a statement			1
' the scope of the @entity6 ’s incompetence – and @entity19 ’ indifferent oversight – is breathtaking and disturbing			1
' the @entity22 senator conducted a year - long investigation into the @entity6 and found that more than 1,000 veterans died over the last decade as a result of the @entity6 's incompetence , and taxpayers footed the bill for $ 845 million in medical malpractice payments			1
sen. @entity1 , right , confers with sen. @entity29 , left , during a meeting of the @entity31 at the @entity32 today veterans listen to opening remarks by members of @entity19 during a meeting of the @entity37 today to discuss a bill that would expand veterans ' access to care the @entity6 has a long history of mismanagement , dating back to president @entity43 's administration , but the appetite for reform ripened only after a retired physician at a @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , came forward earlier this year with allegations that more than 40 veterans in the @entity49 area had died while waiting for care			1
veterans at that hospital were routinely put on secret waiting lists , the whistleblower , dr. @entity55 , said , to cover up to cover up how long it was actually taking @entity6 doctors to see vets for the first time			1
official documents showed that veterans were being seen within two weeks to a month of requesting an appointment , as required by @entity6 guidelines			1
in reality , they were waiting months on end			0
around the time of the @entity49 revelations , other @entity6 whistleblowers came forward , reporting similar behavior at their facilities			2
the @entity75 was subsequently compelled to launch a system - wide investigation into the @entity6 's facilities across the country			1
the @entity6 launched it 's own investigation , spearheaded by the @entity82 , as well , and two @entity6 officials , including secretary @entity84 , stepped down			1
the department 's internal audit of 731 medical facilities was released last thursday			2
it showed that more than 56,000 veterans waited more than 90 days for their initial appointments			0
more than 10 percent of veterans seeking care faced wait times of more than 30 days , the report said , contradicting government claims the week before that only 4 percent of vets were n't seen in a timely manner			2
many @entity6 schedulers were motivated to lie about wait times in order to receive goal - based bonuses , the audit discovered			0
a scheduler at the @entity49 hospital confirmed to @entity106 in an interview that aired monday night that she was told to put new requests for appointments on a ' secret list ' in a drawer instead of in the @entity6 's appointment scheduling program			1
the scheduler , @entity113 , said she decided to report her hospital to the authorities after she called a veteran 's home to follow - up on an appointment request and found out he had passed away			2
@entity119 said she 'd note in a veteran 's records if he had died before receiving care , and on at least seven occasions , someone went back and changed the information to cover up the death			0
' so if you change that to , " entered in error " or , my personal favorite , " no longer necessary , " that makes the death go away			0
so the death would never be reported then , ' she said.the @entity134 told president @entity135 in a letter on monday that the @entity6 's behavior shows a ' troubling pattern of deficient patient care ' and its @entity140 repeatedly ignored the testimony of whistleblowers			1
' this approach has prevented the @entity6 from acknowledging the severity of systemic problems and from taking the necessary steps to provide quality care to veterans , ' @entity144 special counsel @entity143 said			2
sen. @entity1 's report noted that a lack of funds is n't the @entity6 's problem , it 's waste and abuse of taxpayer resources			1
in 2011 the @entity6 held a conference at the @entity159 and attendees were treated to lavish spreads of cheeses and breakfast sandwiches yet still received meal reimbursements from the government the @entity6 held an 11 - day conference at the @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity50 , for 40 employees in 2011 to the tune of $ 220,000 likewise , @entity1 said his own investigation ' found the problems at the @entity6 are far deeper than just scheduling			1
' the criminal behavior at the @entity6 is ' pervasive ' he said			0
among the examples included in his report was a nurse at @entity177 , @entity178 's @entity48 hospital who was charged with murder after she gave a veteran too much morphine and he died			2
the nurse pled guilty to involuntary manslaugher , but was only sentenced to time served eight days			0
two other patients of the nurse ' died under suspicious circumstances ' involving morphine , as well , according to a local news report			0
the head of security at the @entity190 pleaded guilty to charges ' two sadistic kidnapping , rape and murder conspiracies , ' according to the @entity195			0
a male neurologist at the @entity197 in @entity198 was placed on paid administrative leave for two years after five female veterans filed sexual misconduct charges against him			0
it took the @entity6 two months after his arrest to suspend him without pay and a year to terminate his employment			2
the neurologist eventually admitted to ' conducting inappropriate pelvic and breast examinations on patients			0
' another doctor who worked at @entity210 at the same time was hired within two years of being acquitted of sexual harassment charges by 16 former patients			0
a social worker at an @entity216 va hospital was paid for a year after she was placed on leave for having sex with one of her patients and ' socializing with five clients			0
' she was paid $ 65,000 a year in salary before she was fired and ' stripped of her license ' by the @entity224			0
' in these cases , paid administrative leave is the equivalent of disciplining a misbehaving child by suspending his chores while continuing to pay him an allowance , ' @entity1 said			2
just as troubling is that @entity1 's report is based on information on information readily available to the @entity6 - and the public			1
the 124 page document is merely a compilation of @entity237 and @entity75 reports and accounts of the @entity6 's bad deeds in local and national newspaper			1
this is how backed up one @entity6 office is on processing veterans claims , @entity242 report said ' the vast majority of @entity6 employees are dedicated public servants who demonstrate genuine passion to care for veterans and their families every day			1
at @entity6 , we depend on the service of @entity6 employees and leaders who place the interests of veterans above and beyond self - interest , ' the @entity6 said in a statement on tuesday			1
@entity1 released his report as members of the @entity82 and @entity264 committees were convening for a joint conference on similar bills passed by their respective chambers that would allow veterans to go to hospitals outside the @entity6 network to get care			1
the @entity82 's bill bans bonuses for @entity6 employees until the end of 2016 , while the @entity37 's bill only bans scheduling - based bonuses			2
the bills would also give the @entity6 permission the money to open 26 to 27 new hospitals in order to meet growing demands for appointments			0
@entity1 says that a lack of funding is not the @entity6 's problem , however , it 's waste and abuse			1
the department spent $ 220,000 on an 11 - day conference at a @entity168 , @entity50 resort in 2011			0
the cost for 40 employees who attended to stay at the @entity292 was more than $ 90,000 , and the contractor who organized the event was paid upward of $ 100,000			0
the same year the @entity6 spent a total of $ 6.1 million on two conferences in @entity159 , @entity298			2
attendees handsomely rewarded with artisan cheese spreads and swag like notebooks and water bottles and were treated to karaoke and daily recap videos of the conference that cost $ 16,500 to produce			0
' as is typical with any bureaucracy , the excuse for not being able to meet goals is a lack of resources			0
but this is not the case at the va where spending has increased rapidly in recent years , ' @entity1 said .			0

sen. @entity1 released a report on tuesday documenting the @entity6 's misconduct throughout the last decade
@entity1 found out in the course of his *research* that 1,000 veterans died because of @entity6 mismanagement
the @entity6 has had to pay out close to $ 1 billion for instances of medical malpractice
' the scope of the @entity6 ’s incompetence – and @entity19 ’ indifferent oversight – is breathtaking and disturbing , ' @entity1 said in a statement
