by @entity0 for the @entity1 part of @entity3 was evacuated yesterday amid growing fears that the country ’s @entity6 volcano is about to erupt			1
airlines were on high alert as the centre of the island was hit by an earthquake every minute , signalling increased seismic activity below the volcano			1
if @entity6 erupts travel companies have been warned to prepare for a repeat of the chaos seen when @entity3 ’s @entity19 volcano blew in 2010			1
a huge dust cloud shut down much of @entity22 ’s airspace for six days , grounding 100,000 flights and affecting more than ten million people			2
tourists have been banned from visiting the area , which is popular with hikers , and all roads are closed			1
authorities said an eruption might cause the @entity50 glacier – one of the largest in @entity22 – which covers the volcano , to melt , causing mass flooding			1
@entity3 ’s @entity55 said : ‘ it can not be ruled out that the seismic activity in @entity6 could lead to a volcanic eruption			1
the area is now closed and has been evacuated			1
’ it added : ‘ these security measures have been taken since it would not be possible to evacuate the area in time should a sub-glacial outburst flood occur from @entity50 as a result of an eruption			2
’ @entity3 issued a ‘ code orange ’ alert – the second highest risk level – to airlines on tuesday , warning of possible disruption			2
shaking all over : nearly 300 earthquakes were detected near the @entity6 volcano this morning with millions of @entity28 families currently abroad for the summer holidays , and many more planning getaways for the @entity76 weekend , the chaos could be substantial			1
however , the extent of the disruption depends on the wind direction during eruption			2
at the moment , the prevailing winds are blowing south - east , directly towards @entity28			0
forecasters in the @entity28 are carefully monitoring weather systems in the area			2
@entity85 , spokesman for the @entity86 , said last night : ‘ at the moment the air flow is coming from the north - west			0
‘ it looks like it will stay that way until the early hours of monday , when we are expecting a change			0
if there is an eruption , it is all about timing			0
if the air flow changed it might not affect us or @entity22 airspace at all			0
’ forecasting the wind direction is complicated because of the potential height of the dust cloud			0
if the ash is blown 20,000ft into the air , as the @entity19 plume was in 2010 , it would be affected by unpredictable air flows in the upper atmosphere			1
chaos : the @entity19 volcano erupted in 2010 , creating massive disruptions for air travellers at the moment the upper atmospheric winds are flowing in the same direction as surface winds , but that is not always the case			1
miss @entity85 added : ‘ the air moves around in different ways at various different levels in the atmosphere			0
we can not second - guess exactly which direction any airflow in the upper atmosphere will change to			0
’ @entity126 of the @entity127 , said seismic activity was constant , adding : ‘ it does n’t seem to vary a lot – it is concentrated in one area under the glacier			2
’ dr @entity134 , an expert on atmospheric dust clouds at the @entity136 , said : ‘ volcanic ash is a hazard to aircraft , because of sandblasting of the outside of the plane and because particles are sucked into the turbines where they can melt and disable the engines			0
‘ for that reason , aviation authorities impose a limit on the maximum concentration of ash aircraft can fly through			0
’ but he added that a dust plume was ‘ unlikely ’ to have a dramatic effect on @entity28 weather and that those with health conditions affected by pollution should not be ‘ overly worried			0

airlines preparing for repeat of the chaos seen when @entity19 blew
all roads leading to the region near @entity6 volcano are blocked
police say a quick evacuation would not be possible if the volcano erupts
nearly 300 earthquakes were detected in the area on *wednesday*
