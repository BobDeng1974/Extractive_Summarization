two sisters have defied the odds after giving birth within minutes of one another in the same hospital			1
@entity5 had her son @entity6 only three minutes after @entity8 gave birth to her daughter @entity10 on february 19			1
midwives gave the sisters , who live in @entity13 , beds side by side to each other in the same ward at @entity19 hospital , after the births			2
sisters @entity8 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) gave birth three minutes apart in the same hospital in adjacent rooms			1
the sisters are pictured here with @entity10 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) the sisters , who were both overdue , had booked to be induced on separate dates but astonishingly both went into labour on february 19 this year @entity5 , 38 , and @entity8 , 39 , who both already had two children each , were thrilled to fall pregnant at the same time last year			1
neither sister knew the other was pregnant , and the announcements were a huge surprise			0
they went through ante - natal appointments together , also at the same hospital			0
@entity8 , who lives in @entity40 , @entity41 , with husband @entity42 and their older children @entity45 , six , and @entity46 , three , was given february 9 as a due date			1
while @entity5 , who lives in @entity48 , @entity41 , with husband @entity49 , a farmer , and their older children @entity51 , seven and @entity54 , five , was due on february 13			1
older sister @entity8 , who works as a nurse , said that despite their due dates being so close they had never expected to go into labour at the same time			1
she said : ' everyone kept joking we might have the babies on the same day but i did n't think it was possible			0
the consultant - led unit where the sisters gave birth is currently under threat so both @entity69 and @entity5 are both backing a national campaign supporting the unit			1
pictured : dwynwen with her three children in hospital ' both of my sons were born early so i expected this one to be the same			2
' but both babies were overdue and the sisters were booked in to be induced three days apart			2
however , both sisters went into labour before their appointments came			2
@entity5 , 38 , said : ' when i was on my way to hospital , i texted @entity8 to say what was happening , and i could n't believe it when she sent one back to say she was also on her way			1
' @entity8 , who arrived at the hospital shortly after @entity5 , added : ' when i arrived at the hospital , i was told i 'd have to wait because there was someone in the treatment room being examined , and i replied : " tell her to get a move on ! " ' the midwife was shocked until she realised it was my sister			1
' the sisters were allowed on a ward together in the early stages of labour			0
they then gave birth in adjacent rooms , within three minutes of each other			1
@entity5 said that having her sister there made the experience even more special			1
' it was just so nice to have @entity109 around			0
it turned out she gave birth to @entity10 at 1.11am , and i gave birth to @entity6 at 1.14am			1
' @entity8 agreed : ' it was like a family reunion on the ward			1
it was lovely having my sister next to me			0
' the mums were then given beds @entity119 in a maternity ward			0
after giving birth both of the sisters were kept on the same ward before travelling home the next day			0
@entity69 is pictured here at home with her two elder sons and baby daughter @entity10 @entity8 says that the amazing coincidence attracted a lot of attention from the staff in the hospital			2
' the midwives could n't believe what was going on			0
they said they 'd never come across anything like it before , and people were taking photographs as the babies looked so similar and were almost the same weight			0
' @entity5 's son , @entity6 , had a suspected heart murmur so they stayed in hospital for an extra night			2
but the next day he was given the all - clear and allowed home			0
the sisters are enjoying bringing up their babies together and hope they will grow up to be as close as they are			0
they are both also supporting a campaign to keep doctor - led maternity services at the hospital where the two cousins were born			2
the consultant - led unit is currently under threat of downgrade , but without it , the sisters say their story might not have been such a happy one			0
@entity5 said : ' i needed a consultant with me all through the birth because of complications			1
if i had n't been able to go to @entity164 i would have faced a much longer journey to hospital , meaning my baby could have been danger			0
' people like me , living in rural areas , rely on @entity164 as a lifeline			0
' both sisters are now backing a national campaign in @entity13 to keep doctor - led maternity services at @entity19 , in @entity41 , where their babies were born .			0

@entity5 and @entity8 gave birth on february 19
both were due to be induced but went into labour before their appointment
