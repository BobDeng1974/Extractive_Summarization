scraping muck and slime from the side of a tank , and continually cloudy water , annoys many fish owners			2
but now a young designer has created a fish tank that she claims never needs cleaning , the water never needs changing , and owners can save money bu never needing to replace the filter			2
the spherical tank only requires an owner to top up the water occasionally – and to feed the fish			1
the spherical tank , called @entity22 , ( pictured ) only requires an owner to top up the water occasionally – and to feed the fish			1
@entity26 , a graduate from @entity27 , created the 15 - litre tank , which is fitted with technology that enables fish , plants and bacteria ' to work together to create a balanced ecosystem '			1
the tank , called @entity22 , has a self - cleaning filter that ‘ never needs replacing ’			1
a continually - moving bed recycles older bacteria into plant food , creating space for new bacteria to grow			1
‘ harmful ammonia , nitrite and nitrate are naturally removed from the water , meaning the water never needs changing , ’ according to the company , called @entity47			0
crystal clear : a continually - moving bed recycles older bacteria into plant food , creating space for new bacteria to grow			1
‘ harmful ammonia , nitrite and nitrate are naturally removed from the water , meaning the water never needs changing , ’ according to the company , called @entity47			0
the process is illustrated a bright idea : @entity22 features smart led lighting that is optimised for plant photosynthesis and growth , which leads to clear water			1
it glows red in the morning , white during the day , and blue at night to look pretty in a room self - cleaning filter system : the plants and bacteria work together to create a balanced micro-ecosystem			1
the harmful ammonia , nitrite and nitrate are removed from the water meaning the water never needs changing			0
the filtration system is natural and self - maintaining , comprising a moving bed that does n’t need cleaning			2
automatic lighting : when there is too much light , fish tanks get algae			0
@entity22 's lighting is plant - specific , providing the wavelengths that the plants need to photosynthesise and grow , making sure they are cleaning the water efficiently			1
it produces wavelengths of light that our human eyes ca n't detect			0
the light moves around the tank and is magnetic , so can be detached to access the fish and plants easily			0
automatic heating : water is heated at 27 ° @entity98 ) - the perfect temperature for tropical fish			0
the heating elements are positioned to create convection currents which help the nutrients reach the roots of plants			0
plant system : seven plant pots slot into place in the filter system to make them easy for owners to lift out and trim			0
size : the tank holds three - and - a - half gallons of water ( 15 litres )			0
price : it is available to pre-order from £ 150 ( $ 242 )			1
@entity22 features smart led lighting that is optimised for plant photosynthesis and growth , which leads to clear water			1
the lighting is soft red in the morning , white during the day , and blue in the evening			2
the tank is designed for tropical fish with a constant water temperature of 27 ° @entity98 )			0
the heating elements are positioned to create convection currents which help the nutrients reach the roots of plants			0
the plants are housed in seven trays so they can be easily maintained and moved around to change the look of the tank			0
it has taken ms @entity26 over four years to develop the tank , which is now raising funds on crowd funding website , @entity138			2
@entity22 can be pre-ordered from £ 150 ( $ 242 ) plus shipping and the tank is due to be shipped in july next year			1
so far , £ 45,000 ( $ 72,669 ) has been raised out of her £ 60,000 ( $ 96,892 ) goal , with 52 days to go			0
‘ i 've always kept fish and it was a steep learning curve in the early days - trying to maintain a tank properly , making sure my fish were healthy and had a clean tank , ’ ms @entity26 said			2
‘ fish keeping is n't as easy most people think … there 's important bacteria in the tank that need to be maintained , plus there 's the weekly water changes and smelly filter cleaning needed to maintain a healthy tank , ’ she wrote on @entity22 ’s @entity138 page			1
‘ i decided i 'd design something that takes the stress out of keeping tropical fish and makes fish keeping simple , beautiful and above all enjoyable			0
‘ @entity22 is packed full of technology and clever design features that make it really , really easy to keep fish			2
