by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 6 may 2012 updated : 17:12 est , 6 may 2012 disciplinarian : sir @entity2 head teachers have threatened to pass a vote of no confidence in @entity7 ’s chief inspector of schools amid claims of ‘ bullyboy tactics ’			1
the country ’s biggest heads ’ union accused the traditionalist leader of @entity15 of creating a ‘ climate of fear ’ in schools with ‘ negative rhetoric ’			2
the @entity20 urged sir @entity2 to rethink proposals for beefing up the school inspection system and to drop his ‘ confrontational ’ approach			1
delegates at the union ’s annual conference agreed a motion that ‘ does not rule out a vote of no confidence in the future ’ – effectively a call for his resignation			2
they also vowed to collect 100,000 signatures for a petition on @entity37 ’s website to force a @entity39 debate on changes to the inspection regime			0
the row plunges relations between @entity15 and the teaching profession to their lowest point since ex-chief @entity46 declared 15,000 incompetent teachers should be sacked in 1995			0
heads are angry at a series of reforms proposed by sir @entity2 , a former headmaster who recently turned round a failing comprehensive by imposing a strict discipline policy , since he became chief inspector of schools in january			1
these include a three - strikes - and - you ’re - out policy which would involve giving an automatic failing verdict to any school achieving a ‘ satisfactory ’ grading at three inspections in a row			0
in addition , all ‘ satisfactory ’ schools would be rebadged as ‘ requiring improvement ’			1
sir @entity2 has suggested 5,000 head teachers should fall into this category			1
a further proposal to remove the current 48 hours ’ notice of an inspection has already been dropped , with education secretary @entity71 admitting it implied a lack of trust			0
last post : sir @entity2 was the successful executive principal of the @entity76 , @entity77 , east @entity78 before joining @entity15 delegates at the @entity20 ’s @entity81 conference went on the offensive over sir @entity2 ’s regime			1
@entity84 , head of @entity85 in @entity86 , declared : ‘ can we really put our trust in @entity89 ’s chief inspector ? i suggest not			1
‘ we must stand up to the bullyboy tactics of @entity2			1
we need to send a strong message to say we ’ve had enough			0
we deplore his negative rhetoric , which is demoralising our members and creating a climate of fear in schools			0
‘ the time has come for action			0
’ delegates initially put forward a motion calling for an immediate vote of no confidence in the chief inspector			2
after debate , they decided it amounted to the same kind of bullying they were criticising			0
members voted 98.9 per cent in favour of a new motion calling for a petition and a parliamentary debate , which allows for the possibility of a no - confidence vote in future			0
during his career as a head , sir @entity2 earned a reputation as a strict disciplinarian			2
he is best - known for transforming the fortunes of @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78 , with tough discipline			0
a spokesman for sir @entity2 said : ‘ @entity15 has been listening to the views of head teachers , teachers and parents about its proposed changes to school inspections and will announce the results of its consultation at the end of the month			1
