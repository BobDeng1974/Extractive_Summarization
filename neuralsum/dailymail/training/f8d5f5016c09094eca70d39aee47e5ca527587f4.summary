by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:41 am on 28th june 2011 chocolate retailer @entity2 dealt a further blow to the @entity4 today by announcing plans to close up to 180 stores			1
the struggling store will close 120 outlets over three years in another high - profile retail slump following the recent failures of @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity2 , which celebrated its 100th anniversary this year , will close the stores as their leases expire , and is considering the future of 60 other outlets			1
strugging : @entity2 bosses said the chocolate maker announced the store closures to cope with ' challenging trading conditions ' @entity12 closed its doors on saturday before it was put into administration yesterday there was some relief from the latest @entity4 gloom as sofa giant @entity29 defied the slump by announcing plans for eight new stores			1
the group , which operates 80 stores , announced a 3.1 per cent rise in underlying profits after increasing its share of the furniture market			2
the closures by @entity2 , however , will leave the chocolate maker with around 180 to 200 company - owned stores , although in the majority of locations it hopes franchisees will open outlets			1
the closure of the stores could put between 750 and 1,125 jobs at risk , but the company said it would try to find staff alternative roles wherever possible			2
it is the latest blow to the high street after the failure of chains such as @entity11 and @entity14 in recent weeks and @entity12 yesterday			1
discount department store @entity13 is set to join the list of failed retailers today after it reportedly filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator			1
chains such as @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , which have long been the mainstay of @entity68 high streets , are also slimming down their store estates			0
and @entity70 said recently that it would axe 110 shops in order to focus its trading on out - of - town locations			0
the @entity2 strategy review , led by new chief executive @entity76 , will see the company increasingly focus on its commercial division , which sells @entity2 - branded chocolate through other retailers , and grow online sales			1
the review also aims to make the business less dependent on seasonal events such as @entity85 and @entity86 by increasing the number of gifts it sells mr @entity76 said the strategy was the right one because he sees the current weakness in high street footfall and consumer sentiment continuing			0
@entity94 today reported a 70 % slide in full - year profits and warned it will close more stores in an effort to weather the consumer downturn			1
the floor coverings specialist said profits reduced to £ 6.6 million in the year to april 30 after householders were put off making major purchases and also found it harder to obtain mortgages in order to move home			0
sales in the @entity68 and @entity110 fell nearly 5 % to £ 404.5 million in the year			0
the group finished the period with 559 stores in the @entity68 and @entity110 , after closing a net figure of 27 , and said that , with leases on 94 stores due to expire in the next five years , it expected to further reduce the size of its estate			1
@entity120 , @entity94 's chairman and chief executive described trading conditions as ' very challenging '			0
the review said its stores needed an overhaul after a recent lack of investment and changes in shopper behaviour , as they visit the high street less regularly in favour of supermarkets and internet shopping			2
although it still thinks its own stores will remain an important part of its future , it said selling through other retailers will become its main sales channel over the next three years			1
it will revamp its products with gifts for under £ 5 for special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries to help broaden its appeal throughout the year and will develop a new flagship boxed chocolate brand next year			2
it will start offering free tastings in - stores in the next couple of months			2
the group also aims to make efficiency savings at its factories and supply chain in a bid to save £ 2 million a year			0
however , closing the company - owned stores will cost it between £ 4.2 million and £ 4.8 million			1
elsewhere , department store chain @entity13 joined the increasing ranks of struggling high street brands when it today announced it would be appointing an administrator in the next 10 days			1
the move by the @entity164 - based chain , which runs 57 stores , could put 4,000 jobs at risk			0
