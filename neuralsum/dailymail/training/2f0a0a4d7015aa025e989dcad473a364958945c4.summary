no sooner has the pressure eased on one captain than it is being felt by another			2
the news that @entity4 will miss sunday ’s fourth one - day international in @entity5 because of over-rate indiscretions has paved the way for @entity8 to take the reins			1
since @entity8 is without a half - century in 15 one - day innings , the timing may not be ideal			1
but coach @entity12 is hoping his temporary promotion will act as a ‘ catalyst ’ for a player who will need to be at his impish best if @entity17 are to have any chance of challenging for the @entity19 next year			1
@entity8 is on a wretched run of form but will captain @entity17 in @entity5 on sunday @entity8 ’s latest failure , out for a single as he hooked a short ball from @entity26 straight to deep backward square leg during @entity17 ’s restorative five - wicket win over @entity29 in @entity30 on wednesday night , felt like the act of a player wondering where his next score is coming from			1
@entity8 trudges off after being dismissed for one in the third odi against @entity29 but @entity17 regard him as crucial to their gameplan of scoring heavily in the last 20 overs of an innings			1
and no player in the current squad has made more than his six centuries in the format			0
‘ he ’ll be very disappointed that he has n’t yet managed to impact on the series , ’ said @entity12			0
‘ he ’s a top - flight one - day player			0
maybe the captaincy will be a nice catalyst for him , and allow him to take his mind off himself and just go out and play			0
’ the travails of @entity4 , who was suspended for one game after twice failing in the last 12 months to keep his bowlers up with the required rate – against @entity53 at @entity54 in august and now in @entity30 – have masked @entity8 ’s own struggles			1
and @entity8 ’s have been the more surprising			2
a naturally gifted striker of the ball , with an eye for the improbable , he has looked recently like a magician shorn of his wand			0
@entity12 said : ‘ the frustration for him will be how he ’s got out a couple of times			0
you do n’t go away from your basics			0
you do the things you know have worked in the past			2
you ’ve got to believe in yourself			0
maybe the captaincy can be a healthy distraction			0
’ there is frustration , too , that @entity4 has been forced out of a game having just presided over a victory that has unexpectedly dragged @entity17 back into this seven - match series			1
and while ’s @entity4 ’s 34 from 42 balls had a familiar air about it – getting in , then getting out , with @entity79 apparently playing a different game at the other end – @entity12 insisted his under - fire captain had been ‘ timing it beautifully ’			1
@entity8 will take the reins as @entity4 ( left ) is banned for slow over rates in @entity30 @entity8 and @entity4 in 2014 ( odi innings @entity4 matches : 17 runs : 470 high score : 56 average : 29.37 strike rate : 71.97 hundreds : 0 fifties : 1 @entity8 matches : 18 runs : 489 high score : 106 average : 27.16 strike rate : 81.63 hundreds : 1 fifties : 2 the trick now will be to ensure that the @entity30 result is not a one - off , and @entity29 are expected to be boosted on sunday by the return of the vastly experienced @entity100 , who missed wednesday ’s match because it was his young daughter ’s birthday			1
but @entity12 spoke of laughter on the team bus after the game – rare enough on this tour to merit a mention – and of the opportunity created for others by @entity4 ’s enforced absence			2
@entity112 will open with @entity79 after being given a chance last night at @entity114 at the expense of @entity116 , and the vacant slot in the line - up could be taken by @entity119 , the @entity120 batsman who was one of the stars of the new @entity122 last summer			0
the @entity17 coach confirmed that @entity4 would resume the captaincy for the fifth game of this series , which dealt with the mischievous suggestion that the tourists may stumble across a successful formula without him			1
but , as @entity12 said : ‘ we ’re still trying to identify our best team			0
’ the awkward truth is that it may not include the man earmarked to lead @entity17 at the @entity19 .			2

@entity4 suspended for fourth odi against @entity29
@entity8 will captain @entity17 despite his poor run of form
@entity142 has *n't* scored a *ton* in his past 15 odi innings
