@entity1 football captain @entity0 says she would have ' slapped ' the on - court interviewer who asked @entity4 to twirl after her win in the @entity6 last week			1
@entity7 and @entity8 's @entity4 were asked to spin around to show off their outfits during on - court interviews in @entity12 , prompting an angry response on social media and accusations of sexism levelled at @entity18 commentator @entity17 , who made the request			1
@entity0 described the request as ' arrogance or stupidity ' and told @entity22 : ' if i was ( asked by an interviewer to twirl ) i would probably have slapped him around the face or something			1
it was an insult to women 's sport			1
' @entity29 was asked to twirl by interviewer @entity17 and she looked embarrassed at the request @entity1 women 's captain @entity0 as called the request ' an insult to women 's sport ' the @entity8 , practicing here for her quarter - final match , has played down the sexism row @entity0 was speaking at the launch of the @entity41 's @entity40 , which recognise the individuals and organisations doing the most to progress women 's sport - and consign such outdated requests to the past			1
@entity0 added : ' it shows that there still is that ignorance when it comes to women 's sport and that transfers to kids today - people think it is still okay to say things like that			1
' the more we raise the profile of women 's sport through the @entity41 and awards such as these , the bigger the chance of knocking that behaviour and ignorance out of sport and society in general			1
' @entity4 did oblige , later commenting that it was ' unexpected ' that an ' old guy ' asked her to twirl on - court @entity4 laughed as she twirled for the interviewer to show off her outfit after her straight - sets victory the interviewer continued to speak to @entity4 after she twirled for him after her second round match @entity7 ( 1 ) vs @entity75 ( 11 ) @entity76 vs @entity77 ( 18 ) @entity78 ( 10 ) vs @entity79 ( 3 ) @entity4 ( 7 ) @entity80 ( 2 ) the 38 - year - old @entity0 will lead @entity1 to the @entity81 in @entity8 in june admitting the rising profile of the women 's game will heap the squad with the extra pressure of expectation			1
but she is relishing the belated interest after recalling a different story even as recently as the last @entity81 in 2011 when @entity1 exited on penalties at the quarter - final stage			0
@entity0 said : ' the women 's game is reaching new levels in this country and being a role model is now part of the package - i never had a female sporting role model growing up so i am happy to help			2
' there is money and television coming into the game now on a level we did not have four years ago			0
the general public have been involved in the build - up and all it needs now is for the team to perform and the sport will explode again			2
' @entity112 women 's star @entity0 ( right ) is pleased to be a role model for young children @entity0 has the biggest ambitions for the @entity1 squad in @entity8 and believes that having soared unbeaten through their qualification they are justified in believing they are capable of competing with the traditional powerhouses of the women 's game			2
' we have seen a real shift in the players ' mentality over the last few years - you have to have that belief both individually and collectively that you can go out and do it , ' added @entity0			2
' it is something we have probably lacked in the past but we have got it now and with the attitude we have instilled in the team we know we are capable of taking on and beating anyone in the world			0
' the @entity8 wore a typically colourful outfit while practicing in @entity12 on monday @entity4 signs autographs after completing her fourth round victory set up a clash with @entity142 @entity143 , who won the tournament in 1968 , had previously accused @entity17 of being ' truly sexists ' and tweeted : ' the @entity6 interviewer asking the women to ' twirl ' on court is out of line			1
' this is truly sexist			0
if you ask the women , you have to ask the guys to twirl as well			2
' the 12 - time @entity155 singles winner , now 71 , added : ' let 's focus on competition and accomplishments of both genders and not our looks			0
' @entity4 looked slightly bemused by the request , which followed her straight - sets win over @entity164 , admitting in her post-match press conference the question had taken her by surprise			0
' it was very unexpected			0
i mean , yeah , i do n't know			0
an old guy asking you to twirl , it was funny , ' said the seventh seed			0
