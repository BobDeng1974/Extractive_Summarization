in an age where foreign imports are regularly given preference over home - grown talent in @entity6 's top flight , @entity0 showed they are doing their bit for @entity9 football			1
when @entity12 's men lined up before facing @entity13 at @entity14 on saturday , there was a real homely feel to their squad			2
that 's down to the fact that in contrast to their opposition , each of their starting eleven was born in @entity9 - something that has not occurred in the @entity25 since the closing game of the 2010 - 2011 season			1
@entity28 ( left ) celebrates in front of the @entity0 fans after getting himself on the scoresheet at @entity13 @entity0 's starting line - up against @entity13 on saturday consisted entirely of @entity9 - born players @entity0 are 18th in the league , level on points with @entity37 who are above them on goal difference @entity40 were the last @entity25 side to field an all - @entity9 starting eleven against @entity41 on the final day of the 2010 - 2011 season			1
here 's how they lined up			0
@entity46 - @entity45 @entity48 - @entity47 @entity50 - @entity49 @entity52 - @entity51 @entity53 in @entity54 @entity56 - @entity55 @entity58 - @entity57 @entity60 - @entity59 @entity62 - @entity61 @entity64 - @entity63 @entity66 - @entity65 that team in question was @entity69 's @entity40			2
he fielded a side entirely made up of @entity9 - born players against @entity41 at @entity72			2
@entity69 's men suffered a 4 - 2 defeat and it was a similar story on saturday as @entity0 lost 2 - 1 at @entity14			0
following the defeat against @entity77 's squad of global stars , @entity12 spoke openly about his @entity79			1
' we are not necessarily a young group , but we 're quite an inexperienced group as regards regular @entity25 football			0
' we 've got a group who 've maybe had a season in it , but it would be nice to have a few more who 've been around it a long time , ' @entity12 said			0
while @entity12 trains his thoughts on possible incomings , he knows that the speculation regarding @entity0 striker @entity92 ' future is unlikely to go away any time soon			1
@entity64 is mobbed by his @entity40 team - mates after scoring against @entity41 in 2011 the 22 - year - old is out of contract in the summer and @entity96 and @entity97 have been mooted as potential destinations			2
' we do n't need to ignore it , we 're just used to it , ' @entity12 said			0
' he 's used to it , i 'm used to it			0
it 's not a new story - people were talking about @entity108 last year from the beginning of the season so we 're used to it			0
' @entity0 striker @entity92 ( left ) has been linked with a possible move away from the @entity115 club			1

@entity12 *selected* an entirely @entity9 line - up against @entity13
first time for a @entity25 club to do so since @entity40 in 2011
@entity12 spoke about the possibility of losing star striker @entity92
