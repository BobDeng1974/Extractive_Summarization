by @entity1 science correspondent and @entity2 published : 15:01 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 19:28 est , 4 november 2013 @entity3 could be closer than you think			0
research suggests the galaxy is teeming with life – and the nearest habitable world is near enough to see with the naked eye			1
this other world is just one of around 40 billion ‘ earths ’ in the @entity13			2
researcher @entity14 said : ‘ potential sites for life to get started are abundant in the galaxy			2
this graphic shows something scientists call the ' habitable zone ' where the planet 's orbit is not too far from the star such that water freezes , and not too close such that water vapourises ‘ we still do n’t know how easily life can spring forth on a potentially habitable planet but with 40 billion chances , i ’m optimistic that we ’re not alone			1
’ the @entity37 team used data collected by @entity41 ’s @entity40 telescope , which took photographs of 150,000 stars every 30 minutes for four years			1
these images were then analysed for small but regular dips in the star ’s light – a telltale sign that a planet is passing in front of it			2
some 42,000 of the stars monitored were like the sun or slightly cooler and these had 603 planets orbiting them			0
the data was collected from @entity40 which conducted a massive search for planets beyond our solar system			2
it detected the tiny dip in brightness that occurs when an orbiting object crosses , or ' transits ' , in front of a star the @entity40 spacecraft observed 150,000 stars within a field in the constellation @entity71			1
@entity40 , now crippled and its four - year mission at an end , was able to provide enough data to complete its mission objective : to determine how many of the 100 billion stars in our galaxy have potentially habitable planets the hunt is on for planets about the size of @entity23 that orbit at just the right distance from their star - in a region termed the habitable zone			1
the habitable zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water -- an essential ingredient for life as we know it -- to pool on a planet 's surface			1
to determine the location of a star 's habitable zone , scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits			2
knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry			2
for example , molecules in a planet 's atmosphere will absorb a certain amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out			0
how much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes			0
ten of these were @entity23 - like , that is , roughly the size of our planet and just the right distance from their star for it to be neither too hot or too cold for life to survive			1
after accounting for holes in the data , they estimated that 22 per cent of all sun - like stars are circled by a planet that could be suitable for life			1
many are much larger than the @entity23 , or follow orbits so close to their parent stars that their surfaces would be roasted			2
but some are roughly @entity23 - size and lie in the ' habitable ' or ' @entity142 - the orbital band close enough to a star for temperatures to be just right for life			1
by definition , habitable zone temperatures are mild enough to allow oceans and lakes of liquid water			2
in a galaxy of 200 billion stars of various types , this works out at 11 billion planets			1
but factor smaller , dimmer red dwarf stars , and the number of planets with mild temperatures similar to @entity23 rises to 40 billion			1
the relative sizes of @entity40 habitable zone planets discovered in april are shown ( from left to right ) kepler - 22b , @entity40 - 69c , @entity40 - 62e , @entity40 - 62f , and @entity23 @entity40 , which cost £ 395 million , was launched in march 2009 with the chief aim of searching for @entity23 - sized planets that might support life			1
@entity40 used something known as the ' transit method ' to detect extrasolar planets			2
a transit occurs when a planet crosses in front of its star as viewed by an observer			0
transits by terrestrial planets produce a small change in a star 's brightness lasting for one to 16 hours			0
scientists believe this change must be periodic if it is caused by a planet			0
they also claim that all transits produced by the same planet must be of the same change in brightness and last the same amount of time			0
once @entity40 detected a pattern such as this , scientists could calculate the planet 's orbital size from how long it took for the planet to orbit once around the star			2
the size of the planet is found from how much the brightness of the star drops as well as the star 's size			0
from the orbital size and the temperature of the star , the planet 's characteristic temperature can be calculated			0
knowing the temperature of a planet is key to whether or not the planet is habitable			0
dr @entity14 , of the @entity213 , said : ‘ our galaxy has 40 billion chances for life to get started and evolve			1
‘ today , more than ever we need to focus on searching for intelligent life			0
’ however , not all of the temperate planets will be able to harbour life			0
researcher @entity222 ( @entity223 ) , of the @entity224 , said : ‘ some may have thick atmospheres , making it so hot at the surface that @entity229 - like molecules would not survive			0
‘ others may have rocky surfaces that could harbour liquid water suitable for living organisms			0
’ he added : ' the primary goal of the @entity40 mission was to answer the question , when you look up in the night sky , what fraction of the stars that you see have @entity23 - size planets at lukewarm temperatures so that water would not be frozen into ice or vapourised into steam , but remain a liquid , because liquid water is now understood to be the prerequisite for life			1
@entity40 , which cost £ 395 million , was launched in march 2009 with the chief aim of searching for @entity23 - sized planets that might support life			1
pictured here is a 100 - square - degree patch of sky in the @entity13 galaxy taken by @entity40 this image shows the comparative life zones of stars			1
stars that are smaller , cooler and lower mass than the @entity263 ( m - dwarfs ) have their habitable zone much closer to the star than the @entity263 ' until now , no one knew exactly how common potentially habitable planets were around @entity263 - like stars in the galaxy			1
' @entity273 ( @entity223 ) @entity272 , who led the analysis , said : ‘ what this means is , when you look up at the thousands of stars in the night sky , the nearest sun - like star with an @entity23 - sized planet in its habitable zone is probably only 12 light years away and can be seen with the naked eye			1
’ dr @entity286 , an @entity287 astrophysicist , said the study ‘ certainly increases the chances ’ that we are not alone			0
he added : ‘ this is an added impetus for planned future missions which will study the atmospheres of these potentially habitable planets , enabling us to investigate whether they are in fact habitable or not and also whether their atmospheres show actual biosignatures of existing life			2
’ last week , scientists analysing data from the @entity40 probe found that a small hot planet orbiting a star 700 light years away bears striking similarities to @entity23			1
the planet , named @entity308 , is the smallest exoplanet whose mass and size are known			0
it is just 1.2 times bigger than @entity23 , 1.7 times more massive , and has an almost identical density			0
scientists believe that , like the @entity23 , @entity308 mostly consists of rock and iron			0
there the similarities end , however			0
the planet hugs its parent star so closely that nothing could live on its scorching surface			0
@entity308 's year is just 8.5 hours long - the length of time it takes to complete one orbit round its star			0
' it 's @entity23 - like in the sense that it 's about the same size and mass , but of course it 's extremely unlike the @entity23 in that it 's at least 2,000 degrees hotter , ' said dr @entity333 , from the @entity334 , @entity37 , who took part in the research published in the journal @entity338			1
' it 's a step along the way of studying truly @entity23 - like planets			1

team used data from @entity40 telescope which took images of 150,000 stars
the data suggests that our galaxy has 40 billion planets with potential for life
closest @entity23 - sized planet in its habitable zone may be 12 light years away
