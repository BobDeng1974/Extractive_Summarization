@entity0 : @entity2 's jamaica by @entity3 at the height of summer july 1943 , @entity2 , then the assistant to the @entity6 , flew to @entity8 with his old friend @entity9 to investigate reports that a millionaire @entity11 — and @entity13 sympathiser — had built a secret submarine base on the island			1
@entity9 came away convinced that the trip had been a disaster			1
they found no evidence of a base and it rained incessantly — so much so that toadstools grew in their shoes overnight			0
unbeknown to him , @entity2 felt quite differently			1
he did n’t care about the rain or the toadstools in his shoes			0
he loved everything about @entity8 , especially its air of romantic decay			1
@entity8 idyll : @entity30 and @entity31 in @entity34 film dr no , filmed near @entity2 ’s island home as soon as the war was over , he asked @entity9 — who knew the island well — to look for a plot of land where he could build a house			1
@entity9 found a 14 - acre strip of coastline with a thin sliver of silver sand below			1
it was on sale for £ 2,000			0
when he visited the site with the land agent , @entity9 thought it had everything @entity2 wanted			1
gazing out to sea , he saw a beautiful local girl swimming			0
when she got out of the water , she was naked			1
‘ he will adore this place , ’ @entity9 told the agent			1
‘ tie it up tomorrow , @entity60			0
from the start , he had a very clear idea about what sort of house he wanted			0
exotic inspiration : @entity2 at his typewriter in his @entity8 home @entity0 , were @entity34 began the most important thing was that it should be simple			1
there was to be no glass in the windows ‘ so that the birds could fly through ’ , no cupboards , only coat hooks , and the bedrooms should be ‘ insignificant and small ’			0
the finished house looked , according to @entity2 ’s friend @entity77 , exactly like a medical centre , but @entity2 did n’t care			1
@entity77 did n’t think much of the cooking either , claiming that the food ‘ tasted of armpits ’ , but nothing could dent @entity2 ’s enthusiasm			2
shortly after moving into @entity0 , he began work on what was to become the first @entity34 novel , @entity87			1
the mixture of action and sensuality that @entity2 found at @entity91 — as he christened his new home — proved to be the rock upon which @entity34 was built			1
but it was n’t just that — @entity34 owed his very existence to the place			2
@entity2 took his name from the ornithologist author of @entity100			2
@entity2 was a passionate ornithologist , and as @entity104 observes , anyone who kills a bird in a @entity34 story unleashes his fiercest wrath and always ends up dead			1
the rock on which @entity34 was built : shortly after moving into @entity0 , @entity2 began work on what was to become the first @entity34 novel , @entity87 golden home : tense , aloof and pretty unlikable in @entity113 , @entity2 became far more easygoing as soon as he set foot in @entity8 ( @entity91 pictured ) friends who visited @entity2 noticed that he seemed quite different when he was at @entity0			1
tense , aloof and pretty unlikable in @entity113 , he became far more easygoing as soon as he set foot in @entity8			2
in a sense he left his other life behind , at least temporarily , although it was n’t long before trouble — women trouble in particular — followed him across the @entity122			0
for several years he had been having an affair with @entity124 , the wife of @entity125 , proprietor of the @entity127			0
@entity125 , not altogether surprisingly , had become increasingly fed - up with his wife ’s behaviour			0
mixed blessing : @entity124 , @entity2 's mistress and then wife , pictured with her first husband @entity133 when she became pregnant — by @entity2 — he decided he ’d finally had enough and filed for divorce			2
for an incorrigible philanderer like @entity2 , this was a distinctly mixed blessing			2
he felt he had no alternative but to ask @entity124 to marry him , but did so in a spirit of deep foreboding			0
she plainly had her doubts , too			0
writing to @entity2 from @entity142 while he was at @entity91 , she begged him to try to stay faithful to her for three weeks just as an experiment			1
‘ you have never done it before and it might make you feel very happy			0
’ like @entity34 , there was something distinctly misogynistic about @entity2 ’s philandering			1
the novelist , @entity151 , once observed that he ‘ got off with women because he could not get on with them ’			0
all this hardly boded well for their future together			0
on the day that @entity124 ’s decree absolute came through , they were married in the local town hall , then went to @entity0 for a wedding supper			0
again @entity77 , one of the two witnesses , was appalled by the food — ‘ the black crab tasted just like cigarette ash ’			0
but the cooking proved to be the least of their problems			0
@entity124 , it soon became clear , regarded @entity34 as a bit of an embarrassment			2
she referred to @entity2 ’s books as ‘ horror comics ’ and ‘ pornography ’			2
and then there was parenthood			0
when @entity124 gave birth to a son , @entity177 , the couple quickly grew bored of him — a nanny would bring him to see them before dinner , then a few minutes later take him away again			0
@entity2 ’s drinking , always pretty heavy , became heavier still			2
his health began to suffer — doctors repeatedly told him to cut down on the booze and the cigarettes , but to no avail			0
then , just as @entity2 was feeling his age , @entity34 took off			1
the books got a huge boost in 1961 when president @entity190 — no slouch in the bedroom himself — named from @entity194 with @entity195 as one of his favourite novels			0
mix of action and sensuality : @entity30 and @entity31 on the set of dr no in @entity8 not long before , @entity190 and @entity2 had met			1
over dinner , @entity190 asked him what @entity34 would do about @entity205 , who had just seized power in @entity207			1
@entity2 , jokingly , said that @entity34 would slip something into his drink to make his beard fall out			1
amazingly , the @entity211 took up his suggestion and worked on a plan to dust @entity205 ’s shoes with thallium , a strong depilatory			0
three years later , @entity2 was dead of a massive heart attack , at just 56			2
subsequently , @entity0 was bought by the record producer , @entity218 , the son of a friend of @entity2 ’s , who did the place up and turned it into a swanky holiday let — @entity222 wrote @entity223 there			1
you might think there is nothing new to say about @entity2 — that every detail of his life has been obsessively picked over by biographers			2
@entity104 , though , has produced a book as illuminating as it is intriguing			0
written in a quick - fire , atmospheric , prose style that clearly owes something to @entity2 ’s own , it cracks along with all the urgency of a @entity34 novel			1
an odd love story : @entity2 's relationship with his @entity8 home @entity0 might be the most fulfilling affair he ever had as @entity104 shrewdly points out , in an odd sort of way this is a love story — albeit one between a man and a house			1
yet it might just be the most fulfilling affair that @entity2 ever had			2
@entity104 ’s just as insightful on our own love affair with @entity34 and what it tells us about ourselves			0
the books — and films — tap into our sense of national pride , as well as our tendency towards self - deprecation			0
we know that @entity34 ’s patriotism is absurd , and that he himself is absurd , but every time he bumps off another baddy or beds another woman , we ca n’t help raising an imaginary glass and murmuring : ‘ good on you , chum			1

when @entity2 first visited @entity8 in 1943 he was entranced
after the war was over he asked his friend @entity9 to look for a site for him to build a house on
while visiting a plot , @entity9 saw a beautiful naked woman climb out of the water ; it was the clincher
shortly after moving to his new home , @entity2 began writing @entity87
the mixture of action and sensuality he found at @entity91 proved to be the rock upon which @entity34 was built
