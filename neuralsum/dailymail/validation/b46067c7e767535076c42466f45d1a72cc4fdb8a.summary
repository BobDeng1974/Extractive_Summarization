the @entity1 press has laid into @entity2 , and in particular the world 's two most expensive players , @entity5 and @entity6 , after their defeat to @entity8 on sunday			1
@entity9 showed a picture of @entity5 missing from four yards , with the headline ' they missed and they paid for it ' , while @entity14 went with @entity6 's reaction and the line ' so many misses '			1
both @entity2 - based papers emphasise @entity2 's superiority during the game , with as claiming they ' dominated while @entity21 lasted ' , and attacking @entity6 for ' failing again '			1
as say @entity2 ' missed and they paid for it ' while @entity14 highlight @entity2 's dominance and their misses @entity14 ( left ) refused to give @entity6 a rating , while @entity9 said his performance was worth only 4.5 out of 10 @entity14 went even further , refusing to give the @entity27 a mark in their player ratings			1
he scored 4.5 , the lowest of all the players , from @entity9			0
@entity31 were more kind to the rest of the @entity2 players , claiming @entity2 ' overwhelmed @entity8 for 45 minutes , do nâ€™t finish them off and end up against the ropes '			0
both papers also feature @entity1 playing in @entity37 on their front pages , with @entity40 's spectacular volley at @entity41 , and @entity43 's withdrawal from the @entity45 squad , making the headlines			0
however , elsewhere in @entity45 , in the @entity8 - based papers in particular , the focus was on the gap @entity51 's team have opened up at the top of @entity53			2
sport label the result a blow to @entity2 , while @entity57 describe it as a ' two - faced @entity58 ' which saw @entity8 move four points clear			2
@entity57 highlight @entity8 's four point lead at the top of @entity53 , while @entity61 call it a ' blow to @entity2 ' in @entity64 the focus was on @entity65 , who scored a stunning goal to keep @entity67 winning			2
the @entity69 champions beat @entity70 thanks to the former @entity72 and @entity73 striker , leading @entity74 to observe it is ' always @entity65 '			0
@entity65 's goal dominates the front pages in @entity64 , while @entity78 's return to winning ways is also mentioned			0

@entity8 beat @entity2 2 - 1 at the @entity81
@entity1 papers focus on @entity2 's dominance , but @entity8 open gap at the top
@entity6 *blasted* for failing again , while @entity5 missed *glorious* chance
@entity27 so *bad* he is given no mark in @entity14 match ratings
