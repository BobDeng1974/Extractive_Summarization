many scientists believe it takes several decades for the effects of global warming to be felt on @entity4			1
but in fact , it takes just 10 years for a single emission of carbon dioxide ( @entity8 ) to have its maximum warming effects on the planet			1
this is according to @entity13 - based researchers who claim to have dispelled a common misconception that the damaging effects from a co2 emission will only be felt by future generations			1
pictured is the average global surface temperatures in 2013			0
red and dark orange show warmer - than - average temperatures the results suggest that warming can persist for more than a century and that the benefits from emission reductions will be felt by those who have worked to curb the emissions			1
some of these benefits would be the avoidance of extreme weather events , such as droughts , heatwaves and flooding , according to scientists at the @entity23			0
however , some of the bigger climate impacts from warming , such as sea - level rise , melting ice sheets and long - lasting damage to ecosystems , may not occur for hundreds or thousands of years later , they claim			2
' amazingly , despite many decades of climate science , there has never been a study focused on how long it takes to feel the warming from a particular emission of carbon dioxide , taking carbon - climate uncertainties into consideration , ' said lead author of the study dr @entity58			1
the study suggests that warming from @entity8 emissions can persist for more than a century and that the benefits from emission reductions will be felt by those who have worked to curb the emissions ' a lot of climate scientists may have an intuition about how long it takes to feel the warming from a particular emission of @entity8 , but that intuition might be a little bit out of sync with our best estimates from today 's climate and carbon cycle models			1
' to calculate this timeframe , researchers combined information about the @entity4 's carbon cycle with information about the @entity4 's climate system taken from a group of climate models used in the latest @entity85 report			1
the results showed that the average time between a single co2 emission and maximum warming was 10.1 years , and reaffirmed that most of the warming persists for more than a century			2
the reason for this time lag is because the upper layers of the oceans take longer to heat up than the atmosphere , the scientists say			1
as the oceans take up more and more heat which causes the overall climate to warm up , the warming effects of co2 emissions actually begin to diminish as @entity8 is eventually removed from the atmosphere			2
dr @entity104 , a climate scientists , said he was ' terrified ' of the some geoengineering solutions a climate scientist has said he is ' terrified ' of the futuristic technologies he is helping to develop in a bid to slow global warming			1
@entity112 academics have spent £ 5.4 million ( $ 8.5 million ) in the last five years on taxpayer - funded ' geoengineering ' projects to stop the effects of climate change			2
dr @entity104 , lead investigator of a £ 1.8million ( $ 2.8 million ) project to pump chemicals into the atmosphere to reflect the sun 's rays , said using such technologies will become inevitable if humanity fails to stop global warming			2
the @entity126 academic has already suffered a major setback , when much - trumpeted plans to send a huge balloon into the air to test his scheme was scrapped over a patenting dispute			0
last week , he admitted that despite the millions already spent on research , scientists are still decades from seeing their dreams turn into reality			0
and he said they could indeed be dangerous			0
the schemes could see rainfall patterns change , droughts spread across the world and the ozone layer damaged beyond repair			0
' personally , this stuff terrifies me , ' he said			0
' whilst it is clear that temperatures could be reduced during deployment , the potential for misstep is considerable			0
' by identifying risks , we hope to contribute to the evidence base around geoengineering that will determine whether deployment , in the face of the threat of climate change , has the capacity to do more good than harm			0
' but he added that it would be ' unethical ' not to try the technology			0
it takes around 10 years for these two competing factors to cancel each other out and for warming to be at a maximum			0
' our results show that people alive today are very likely to benefit from emissions avoided today and that these will not accrue solely to impact future generations , ' dr @entity58 said			1
' our findings should dislodge previous misconceptions about this timeframe that have played a key part in the failure to reach policy consensus			0
' in the two decades since world leaders first got together to try to solve global warming , the world has become more polluted with heat - trapping gases , more crowded and just downright wilder			1
according to a separate study by the @entity186 , carbon dioxide emissions are up 60 per cent , global temperature are up six - tenths of a degree and sea levels have increased by three inches			1
' simply put , we are rapidly remaking the planet and beginning to suffer the consequences , ' says @entity193 , professor of geosciences and international affairs at @entity196			0
diplomats from more than 190 nations opened talks monday at a @entity201 global warming conference in @entity202 , @entity203 , to pave the way for an international treaty they hope to forge next year			2
overall , what really strikes me is the missed opportunity , ' @entity209 , a climate scientist at @entity211			0
' we knew by the early 1990s that global warming was coming , yet we have done essentially nothing to head off the risk			2
i think that future generations may be justifiably angry about this			0
' global carbon dioxide emission is up 60 per cent since leaders got together to try to solve global warming in 1992			1

study combined data on carbon cycle with data on the climate system
the upper layers of the ocean take longer to heat than the atmosphere
this accounts for the ten year time lag , say @entity13 - based scientists
the results also suggest that warming can persist for more than a century
people alive today are likely to benefit from strategies to cut emissions
carbon dioxide emissions are now up 60 per cent since leaders got together to try to solve global warming in 1992
