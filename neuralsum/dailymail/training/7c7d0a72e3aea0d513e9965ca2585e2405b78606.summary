@entity0 , from @entity1 , appeared on this morning to talk about her feelings of isolation after having a baby many of @entity7 's new mothers are struggling to cope with the pressures of having a baby			1
in a new survey , commissioned by @entity14 healthcare and @entity15 , more than a quarter of first - time mums admit to feeling lonely , with 24 per cent also admitting they had no family nearby to help with the workload of caring for a young child			1
according to health experts , feelings of loneliness leave young mothers more susceptible to mental health problems like post-natal depression			2
for many women , their social network declines after having a child , with 14 per cent of those questioned admitting said they had lost touch with old friends and colleagues			2
this number increases to 25 per cent for young mothers aged 18 - 24			1
despite many activity groups tailored to new mothers , more than a quarter of women said they had n't made any new friends since giving birth			1
this figure increased again for the age group 18 - 24 , with 38 per cent of those questioned giving that answer			1
one women who can sympathise with these feelings is @entity0 , from @entity1 , who suffered crippling feelings of loneliness after giving birth to her first child two years ago			1
shortly after giving birth , @entity0 and her husband relocated to a more rural area with their new baby			1
the lack of friends in the area and issues with public transport left her feeling lost and alone			2
appearing on this morning to talk about her experiences in an effort to help other new mothers , @entity0 revealed that after a couple of months , her feelings of isolation meant that her self - confidence took a nosedive			1
she said : ' i 'd mentally prepared myself for it but it turned out to be something out of my control			0
i did n't expect it to be such a shock to the system			0
' i would class myself as very capable , but when you 're a new mum and have a baby you do n't feel like that			1
to make matters worse , the new mother also had trouble getting her child to breastfeed			0
she said : ' i spent three months trying to breastfeed ... if i did n't open up and say i ca n't do this any more i would n't have been able to do look after my daughter properly			0
' eventually , @entity0 's emotions got the better of her and she started to spend more and more time at home alone ,			1
until she decided to confide in her husband and other new mothers about the way she was feeling			2
she said : ' i felt a weight come off my shoulders			0
i felt like i 'd been tense for three or four months			0
' my husband would say i like to take control in the house , but i was n't able to do that			0
' he knew it was important for me to find people to connect with while he was at work			0
' people say " do n't have structure ; you cant have structure with babies " , but i need it			0
' i thought , right , every day i 'm going to do one little thing that my daughter and i will really enjoy			0
' i went out and met two people who will be lifelong friends			0
' baby blogger @entity124 ( right ) , who appeared with @entity0 ( left ) on @entity125 believes there is too much pressure on first - time mothers baby blogger @entity124 , who appeared with @entity0 on the @entity130 programme , said : ' there 's too much pressure on first - time mothers to live up to expectations			1
' we need to give ourselves a break			0
' when a mother looks like she has it all planned out , you can bet your life she does n't			0
' we need to make it easy to say " i 'm having a difficult time "			2
' there are toddler groups , play groups and all sorts of baby classes you can go to			2
' but even figuring out how you 're going to get there in your car can be difficult - it 's a big thing			2
' more young first - time mothers aged 18 - 24 do n't attend baby classes and also feel more isolated psychotherapist @entity153 said : ' often , first time mothers are not prepared for the fact that when they gain a baby they also lose a great deal of their former lives in the shape of their freedom , job , figure and sex life			1
' it 's important that first time mums are familiar with the concept of postnatal depression so that they do n't feel too isolated , ashamed or inadequate if it happens to them - and also that they seek help promptly			1
feelings of loneliness and isolation are not unusual			0
a proportion of new mothers become seriously depressed following the birth of a baby			1
this probably wo n't happen to you - but if you are very sad and weepy do seek help earlier rather than later 2			2
get involved with other young mothers via social media and join a mother - and baby group in your area - perhaps a massage baby class - where you will bond with other new mums as they too get used to being parents			1
if any friends or relatives offer help , do accept it			0
of course you want to be seen to be in charge but a couple of hours off to sleep or to go out for a meal with your partner will elevate your mood â€“ and is a responsible thing to do for yourself			0
it 's easy to lose sight of who you were before you became a parent			0
having a laugh and a gossip with good mates is a great way of boosting your mood and helping you to feel more like you			2
