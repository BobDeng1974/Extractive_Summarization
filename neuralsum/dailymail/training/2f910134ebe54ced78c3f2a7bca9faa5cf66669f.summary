you know how the old saying goes when two people fall in love at first sight ... their eyes met across a crowded room			0
next they were being seduced by the open wounds all over each other 's faces and lusting after the blood dripping from their snarling mouths			0
in fact not all , unless you 're @entity16 and her partner @entity17 who are planning a fairytale wedding after meeting as they played zombies in a horror movie			1
@entity16 , 30 , fell for @entity17 , 39 after they were cast together alongside 300 other extras as flesh eating monsters who terrorise a community in a @entity28 film called the @entity29			1
but the pair met by chance again at a ghost hunt earlier this year and realised they had met previously on set			1
now the couple are due to tie the knot after @entity17 popped the question			1
@entity16 , a mother of two from @entity52 , @entity53 said : ' we were going to have a zombie themed wedding but as it is going to be in @entity58 our latex make up would probably melt in the searing heat			0
@entity16 said she loved @entity17 's sense of humour straight away and the pair share a love of comics and superheros @entity16 and @entity17 only crossed over on the set of the independent movie for one day , losing contact for months ' as we both love comics , we 're going to have a superhero themed wedding instead with the female guests playing damsels in distress in summer dresses whilst @entity17 will wear a @entity77 shirt			1
but we 'll still be having a zombie element to the wedding as that is how we met - so in the vows we 'll be saying we promise to save each other from a zombie apocalypse			1
' @entity16 met @entity17 in 2012 after she saw a @entity85 post advertising for extras to appear in the movie which was filmed at a disused warehouse in @entity89			1
she was among 300 extras who underwent an hour of make - up before the group were split into separate ' zombie hordes			2
' she added : ' i had been single for a few years and thought that this zombie extra work would be a great opportunity to make some new friends			0
' i arrived at 9am had all my makeup done by 11am and spent the rest of the day high on adrenaline			0
' it certainly was n't the kind of place i thought i would fancy anyone , everyone looked as realistic as the zombies in @entity108			0
after meeting again by chance and adding each other on @entity111 realised that he was her mystery zombie and within a few months they became a couple ' i just remember hearing this loud bloke a few meters away from me and remember everyone laughing at his jokes about zombies and about how he looked better with the make - up on rather than off - i liked him instantly			1
' we really hit it off , both of us liked computer games and comic books but because the day was so busy i did n't have chance to get his number			2
filming was ongoing for another three months so i was sure i would see him again - but i was absolutely gutted when he did n't turn up the next day			0
' ' the problem was i had no idea what he looked like , i spent a good few months keeping my eyes and ears out for him , but i never saw him after that			0
i spent hours searching for @entity17 during the three months of filming but unfortunately he 'd finished his stint that day			2
' months later , by chance , the pair bumped into each other after she reluctantly went to a ghost hunting night with a friend			2
it was there she met a man who was also called @entity17 and they hit it off straight away			2
the pairs love of dressing up means they will dress as superheros for their wedding in @entity58 , though unfortunately the heat means the latex zombie make up would have melted after adding each other on @entity111 realised that he was her mystery zombie and within a few months they became a couple			1
@entity17 moved from @entity163 with his son @entity164 , 11 , to be with @entity16 and her daughters @entity166 , 12 and @entity167 , 6			2
in june 2014 @entity17 proposed to @entity16 at the same spot when they first met as zombies			1
@entity16 said : ' when i met @entity17 again at the ghost hunting event , i did n't even realise it was him and did n't put two and two together			1
' i had never seen @entity17 without his zombie make up on so for all i know he could have been anyone			1
' @entity16 has since donned her zombie costumes for numerous other events such as tattoo shows , television work and even for an @entity179			0
she hopes to continue her zombie work and could n't think of a better job			0
she said : ' @entity17 only did extra work that one time , i think he found it quite long as we were there from 9am all the way up till 7pm			2
' for me though i absolutely love it , i look forward to dressing up - i find the whole experience fascinating			0
plus it gave me the love of my life , even if i did n't know what he looked like as a human			0
people have been joking with un-dead happy in love			0
