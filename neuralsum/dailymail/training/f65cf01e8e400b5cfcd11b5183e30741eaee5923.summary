by @entity0 published : 09:20 est , 10 july 2012 updated : 09:36 est , 10 july 2012 low - cost airline @entity1 will become the first to make passengers pay to bring hand luggage into the cabin			1
passengers travelling between @entity6 and the @entity8 city of @entity9 will be charged Â£ 8 to carry items larger than a handbag , rucksack or laptop on board under trial policy being introduced next month			1
if the trial is successful the policy will be rolled out across the whole @entity1 network			1
heading for turbulence ? @entity1 is introducing extra fees for ' larger ' hand baggage items if the dimensions of a bag exceed 42cm x 32cm x 25cm , its owner will be expected to pay the additional fee to keep it with them - even if it fits inside an overhead locker			1
if the item is smaller , the passenger will be allowed to take it on board free of charge - as long as it fits underneath the seat in front of them			2
customers paying the fee for a trolley case or other larger item of hand luggage will be able to board the plane early - after priority passengers - to ensure there is sufficient space in overhead lockers			2
bags that measure 55cm x 40cm x 20cm or larger , or that weigh more than 10kg , must be checked into the hold			0
small trolley cases such as the one pictured would be unlikely to meet @entity1 's new criteria @entity1 claims the trial will ' reduce boarding hassle and improve on - time performance , and result in a better overall travel experience '			1
travel industry commentator @entity55 , from @entity57 , described the maximum size for free hand luggage under @entity1 's trial policy as ' tiny '			1
' if you are trying to avoid paying to check in bags by using hand luggage , this is bad news , ' he said			0
' it forces people to travel with next to nothing if they do n't want to pay extra			2
' mr @entity55 said customers could get a shock if they found themselves being charged extra for what they thought was a ' regular - sized ' piece of hand luggage			0
' customers are unlikely to be happy at having to pay for something that they have previously taken for granted , ' he said			0
' i would be horrified if i saw other airlines following this idea - but i would n't be surprised to see other budget carriers looking at this			0
' it 's all about revenue			0
' @entity1 currently flies from @entity6 to a range of destinations across @entity84 , including @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89 in @entity90 , and @entity91 in @entity92 .			0

@entity1 passengers will have to pay for any item that does not fit under their seat under new trial *scheme*
