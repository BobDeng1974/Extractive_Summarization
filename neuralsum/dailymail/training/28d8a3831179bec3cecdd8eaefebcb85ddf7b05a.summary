online dating is the best way for hopeful singletons to find love than in the modern world			0
but one controversial dating site has taken the selection process to a whole new level by allowing its users to filter out members looking for romance according to their body type ... for a price			1
popular @entity14 dating site , @entity15 lets online daters pay $ 4.95 ( £ 3 ) to hide anyone who classes themselves ' curvy ' , ' skinny ' , ' thin ' , ' jacked ' or ' used up ' among other body types			1
filter : @entity15 lets its users pay £ 3 a month to filter out people who class themselves as ' curvy ' ' while it will probably be common knowledge to many internet dating aficionados , @entity15 ’s premium search options are eyebrow - raising in an era of tolerance and political correctness , ' writes @entity33 journalist @entity32 , who spotted the function			1
@entity15 also allows its ' a-list members ' - who pay a monthly subscription fee of between $ 4.49 and $ 9.95 - to filter people by both looks and figure			1
would you filter out people of certain body types and levels of attractiveness to find your perfect match online ? one dating site lets you do just that select your type : a drop down menu allows users to filter matches by their body type , essentially allowing them to hide overweight people you can select people in a drop - down menu who have body types such as ' thin ' , ' skinny ' , ' overweight and ' curvy '			1
you can also filter people based on their attractiveness rating , as ranked by other users			1
an anonymous @entity15 user added : ' i 've been using @entity15 for just over a year now , and it 's pretty disconcerting to think men have the ability to filter me out by my body type			2
' however , the function is still placing a lot of trust in people 's accurate description of themselves			0
i myself have been lucky that every guy i 've met from the site has looked their pictures , but others i know have had some horrible surprises when they meet in person			0
a-listers : premium users , who pay to upgrade their account , are allowed to filter out people based on their appearance rating , too ' equally the search for " only five star " rated people will not always yield supermodel results , as people , or at least myself , occasionally rate people on the quality of their profile and how they answer the site 's questions , rather than purely their aesthetics			1
' beauty , after all , is supposed to be in the eye of the beholder			0
' ultimately , what freaks me out the most is the kind of person that would pay to exercise that degree of control over their results			0
to me , that suggests that the weird and wonderful world of online dating might not be for you			0
' @entity110 added : ' @entity15 is clearly the @entity111 of dating sites , allowing curvy types to be screened out of supposed a-list members searches			2
' all i can say is that you 're pretty dumb and z - list if you allow screening so prejudiced that some brainless body - fascist can screen out all plus - size suitors : goodbye @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125			0
' and , you know what ? i have a strong feeling that all of those people would be a hundred times better ( and funnier ) in bed than your average waif			2
i guess this is a perfect example of be careful what you wish for : do you really want to spend the rest of your life with an exercise bore who exists on seaweed smoothies ? '			0
