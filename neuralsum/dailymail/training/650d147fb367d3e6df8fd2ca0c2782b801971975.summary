by @entity0 published : 19:31 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 20:08 est , 6 december 2013 thought the hairstyles of the 1980s were just a dim and distant memory ? try telling that to @entity4 , who looks as though he ’s drawn the inspiration for his rather bouffant hairdo straight from @entity7 , lead singer of 80s band @entity9			1
but it would n’t do to mock his carefully coiffed locks			0
because two - year - old budgie @entity13 is a chart - topper himself – in fact , he is officially the number one of his kind in the world			1
top prize : two - year - old budgie @entity4 has just been crowned best in show at the @entity22 and ( right ) @entity7 of @entity9 he has just been crowned best in show at the @entity22 , the so - called ‘ crufts for budgies ’			1
with his eye - catching feather - cut , he ’s a little more flamboyant than the average budgie			2
he ’s a pedigree goldenface grey budgie , bred especially to achieve his distinctive looks by @entity32 and his father @entity33 , who live near @entity34			2
pedigree budgies are taller than their ordinary counterparts , usually measuring around 6in			0
they also have wider faces and large , distinctive neck spots			0
the @entity40 have been breeding budgies for more than 20 years			1
@entity32 , now a 30 - year - old partner at a law firm , got his first one aged eight ‘ as a means of appeasing ’ him after his parents would not buy him a dog			1
his interest grew from there , and today he and 63 - year - old @entity33 keep around 300 budgies in a 32ft by 10ft aviary			1
pedigree budgies can be bought for £ 50			0
following his win , however , @entity4 could be worth considerably more			2
but @entity32 said : ‘ i ’m not saying someone would not pay a lot of money for a bird like this			0
‘ but it would be like selling your life ’s work , it would not be worth it			0
you ca n’t put a value on a bird like this , he is priceless			0

@entity4 won top prize at ' budgie crufts '
two - year - old best in show in @entity22
