a judge is siding with a @entity2 woman seeking to use frozen embryos to have a child over the objection of her former boyfriend			1
@entity7 was diagnosed with lymphoma four years ago			1
knowing chemotherapy would make her infertile , she had embryos frozen before treatment			1
her then - boyfriend , @entity12 , provided the sperm			1
they broke up a year later and @entity12 changed his mind , leading to a lengthy court battle			0
in court : @entity7 and @entity12 created frozen embryos with their egg and sperm after she was diagnosed with cancer			1
but they later broke up and he said he no longer wants her to use the embryos a @entity25 judge on friday awarded custody of the embryos to @entity7			1
the judge said @entity7 's " desire to have a biological child in the face of the impossibility of having one without using the embryos outweighs " @entity12 's privacy concerns			1
@entity12 says he will appeal			0
@entity7 , 42 , maintains that she has the right to have her biological children and should control the future of the embryos , while her ex-boyfriend @entity12 , 32 , argues that he never agreed to give up his say in the matter			1
@entity7 has since gone on to carry and give birth to a son - using a donor egg and donor sperm , @entity12 's attorney confirmed			1
but he added that would not affect the outcome of the case as the court distinguishes between a child that is biological and ' essentially adopted '			0
the couple , who met through their work in a @entity2 hospital , had been dating for just five months when @entity7 received her diagnosis			1
after @entity12 agreed to provide his semen , he gave a sample at @entity61 's fertility clinic , the @entity57 reported			0
' it was a very emotional time and i was just trying to support @entity7 the best way i could , ' the firefighter and former nurse told the newspaper			2
@entity7 , in a court deposition , added : ' i thought about my different options , of using a sperm donor or someone that i knew for many years and that was a wonderful person			1
' so i decided to go with someone that i thought was a wonderful person and i trusted			0
' new life : she had a child through donors two years after they broke up but she is still fighting to use the embryos for another child			2
lawyers said her baby would not affect the outcome of the case @entity12 v. @entity7 will set a new precedent in the state of @entity87 , where lawmakers have never ruled in a similar case			2
but what decisions have been reached in other states , and what clues do they give to the outcome of the case ? in @entity95 last year , an appeals court gave frozen embryos to a woman who wanted to give birth even though her ex-husband wanted to embryos destroyed			1
as in this @entity87 case , the ex-wife was believed to be infertile following treatment for cancer			1
the court ruled that her wish to be a mother outweighed the man 's desire not to parent children			0
but in @entity112 , a court has previously decided that parenthood could not be forced on someone who was not willing			0
the @entity115 in 1992 ruled that fatherhood was going to be a greater burden for an ex-husband than destroying the embryos would be for his ex-wife , and she was not granted the embryos			0
also similar to this case , a couple in @entity124 who froze embryos signed an agreement saying they could only be used with consent from both parties			1
but the wife , who later became infertile , later requested sole custody of the embryos - which the husband opposed			1
the @entity135 ruled that the contract should stand and the embryos were donated to research			0
at the time , the couple also signed a document that stated ' no use can be made of these embryos without the consent of both partners '			2
they met up with an attorney and a second agreement that gave @entity7 sole control of the fertilized eggs was drawn up - but the couple never signed it			1
two months after the hospital visit , @entity12 broke up with @entity7 via text message			1
he said he had initially been honored to help out his girlfriend , but later had reservations			0
' i have the right not to be a father , ' he said			0
' it 's something i take very seriously and feel very strongly about			0
' but he later changed his mind and said that he would give @entity7 control of the embryos if the child could never be traced back to him - but when he asked the hospital to destroy his records , they refused			1
he eventually concluded that the child would be traced back to him and that he did not want children at all , at any point			2
in june 2010 , he wrote in an email that he worried he would find someone he was ready to have a family with - but that they would reject him based on the fact he had a child he did not know with a women he did not love			2
but as had been predicted , @entity7 was left infertile by her successful cancer treatment			1
experts said that this infertility did not mean she was unable to carry the embryos and have a child			0
she wrote her ex-boyfriend an email in september 2010 , reading : ' i had a chance to use a random sperm donor and you took that away from me by agreeing to help			2
' i trusted you and now you are trying to take away my chance of having a biological child ... those embryos mean everything to me , and i will fight this to the bitter end			0
' her right ? @entity7 said he agreed to have her children when he gave her his sperm for the embryo and can not take away her right to have children			1
he argues he should not be forced to have them after the fallout , a @entity25 trial court awarded @entity206 rights to the embryos , but @entity12 appealed and a higher court sent the case back , explaining that the case focuses on prior agreements rather than the interests of either party			2
the battle now concerns whether the pact occurred when @entity12 gave the sample or when they signed the medical consent form requiring joint consent for the use of the embryos			2
his attorney , @entity222 , argued that couples often change their minds about having children and the courts should not be involved			0
but @entity7 's lawyer , @entity227 , countered : ' at this point , that sperm no longer exists			1
it has fertilized an egg and become something entirely different : a pre-embryo			0
it is now too late for him to back out of his promises			2
' battle : the couple is now waiting for the @entity239 to decide if they will hear the case the case centers around a very modern problem - and an example of technology causing problems that far exceed the scope of the law			0
the need for a definitive ruling is needed now more than ever			0
in 1985 , 260 babies were born through assisted reproductive technology ; in 2010 , the number topped 61,000 , according to the @entity254			0
' this is a decision that really affects every person , ' he told @entity259			0
' hundreds of thousands of embryos are frozen in @entity87 and this case affects what you do with these			0
' it raises some very fundamental issues about creating human life and when your consent is required and it affects all of those cases in the future			0

@entity7 was diagnosed with *non-hodgkin* lymphoma in march 2010 and asked then - boyfriend to give his sperm for frozen embryos
he agreed and they create three embryos - but two months later he broke up with her and said he no longer wanted children
they had signed agreement saying both needed to consent to use embryos
but her cancer treatment left her infertile and she argued she has the right to biological children and ' it is too late for him to back out of his promises '
a @entity2 judge on friday awarded the eggs to @entity7
