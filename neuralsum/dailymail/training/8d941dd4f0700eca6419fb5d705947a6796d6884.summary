an underground fire could burn for years after breaking out in a disused 119 - year - old coal mine			1
bemused walkers dialled 999 over the weekend after smoke started pouring out of the ground on a footpath between a golf club and the @entity7 near @entity8			0
since then the fire has shown no sign of going out - and experts have established it is on land which formed part a colliery that closed permanently 49 years ago			1
it is on land that was part of a 119 - year - old disused colliery and no one knows when it will go out shut : production slowed in the 1950s and the mine employed fewer than 600 people by the time it shut in 1966 they believe the land was part of the @entity36 , which opened in 1896 and employed more than 1,100 people at its peak in the 1930s			1
the mine 's production declined in the 1950s and it employed fewer than 600 people by the time it closed in 1966			1
fortunately for the firefighters , they believe the blaze 's fuel is spoil which was used to fill in two ponds - not a coal seam , which have been known to burn for thousands of years			1
one seam , @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53 , is thought to have been on fire for 5,000 years since it was ignited by a lightning strike - providing an unusual attraction for tourists who flock to the smell of sulphur			1
another coal seam fire in @entity61 is still burning despite being set alight in 1884			1
some way to go : one coal seam , @entity51 in @entity53 ( pictured ) , has been smoking for 5,000 years found from @entity65 to the @entity66 , underground fires can burn for centuries and are at their most serious when they involve coal or peat			1
fires need fuel , oxygen and heat to burn , which means mines or jagged fissures ( in the case of @entity53 's @entity51 ) are ideal for them to keep alight for years			1
in coal mines , especially active ones , the fires have an ample supply of fuel			0
the oxygen is then drawn down through the mine shaft - and in such an enclosed space , the heat takes care of itself			2
they can be ignited by natural causes such as a lightning strike or wildfire , and once they begin they are hard to stop			0
most underground fires ' smoulder ' rather than burning with a naked flame , especially in a damp substance such as peat			0
without significant excavation the experts still have no idea how long the new fire in @entity104 , @entity19 , will be alight			2
they have closed the footpath as a precaution amid fears the land will cave in , bringing the trees which line the river with it			2
@entity112 , watch manager at @entity114 fire station , said : ' there is an underground fire which is quite a rare occurrence			0
' generally they are caused by either a coal seam or a mix of aggregates accumulated and spoil from the coal heap			1
' in this case we spoke to the @entity124 and it 's unlikely to be a coal seam			1
' we looked at an @entity128 map from the 1940s and in the exact spot as the fires there used to be two large ponds and these have been back filled			0
' that 's what appears to be on fire , we ca n't say for certain but it 's likely to be a mix of spoil			0
' the last one of this nature was at the site of @entity143 in 1993 - that fire went on for two years at the @entity145			2
' he added : ' the fire could burn for a day , a week or a month			2
the fire could burn itself out			2
it is one of the most difficult incidents to deal with			0
' closed : firefighters fear the fire could cause surrounding land to collapse and bring down trees @entity112 , watch manager at @entity114 fire station , said : ' the fire could burn for a day , a week or a month			1
the fire could burn itself out			0
it is one of the most difficult incidents to deal with ' the closure is a blow to the rural area 's well - worn riverside walk			0
' it is a very popular route , ' mr @entity112 said			0
' there is a possibility of collapse - if the fire is burning underground there 's a potential to create a cavity			0
' there are trees between 25ft to 40ft from the path and with the fire burning underground there it could be burning the roots and they could then fall			0

@entity180 thought to be part of 119 - year - old @entity183 mine , @entity19
@entity185 once employed 1,100 people but closed permanently in 1966
fears it could be a *repeat* of last similar fire , which burned for two years
but firefighters say it is unlikely to be a coal seam , which burn longest
a seam in @entity53 , @entity51 , has been on fire for 5,000 years
