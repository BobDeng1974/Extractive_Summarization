it has been ‘ officially extinct ’ for decades , but two @entity2 scientists have set off across the world to hunt for the curious animal known as the @entity6 tiger			1
the last known tiger died in captivity in a @entity6 zoo in 1936 , but a team of enthusiasts believe there is still a chance that several of the animals might still be roaming the forested regions of the island state			1
@entity2 scientists dr @entity18 and @entity19 , who have searched for giant anacondas in @entity21 and the @entity23 equivalent of @entity24 , are due to arrive in @entity6 today to join an expedition searching for the tiger , which has a dog - like appearance and a striped body			1
the last known tiger died in captivity in a @entity6 zoo in 1936 , but a team of enthusiasts believe there is still a chance that several of the animals might still be roaming the forested regions of the island state ‘ this is very serious and we ’re putting aside all the other crazy things like @entity24 hunts and concentrating very much on getting the first convincing evidence that the @entity6 tiger still exists , ’ expedition leader @entity37 told the @entity38 from the search base in the island capital , @entity41			1
while there have been reported sightings of the tiger , known scientifically as a thylacine , mr @entity37 said the evidence has never been strong enough to be convincing			0
‘ the problem with a lot of the sightings from members of the public is that they ’re generally caught by surprise and their photos are taken on things like mobile phones and are n’t very good			0
‘ it will take really good quality video to really convince anyone so we ’ve brought as much gear as we can to improve our chances of being ready if we do see one			0
’ dr @entity18 and mr @entity19 , from @entity2 ’s @entity69 , have explored many of the world ’ outstanding mysteries and remain dedicated to cryptozoology - the study of unknown animals			1
the centre is based in an old country house in @entity79 , parts of which are over 200 years old , and which is said to be home to several ghosts			0
the @entity6 tiger features strongly as a ‘ most wanted ’ animal among the centre ’s members - a picture of one is used as the group ’s emblem			2
@entity2 scientists dr @entity18 and @entity19 , who have searched for giant anacondas in @entity21 and the @entity23 equivalent of @entity24 , are due to arrive in @entity6 today to join an expedition searching for the tiger ( pictured ) the @entity2 researchers , along with mr @entity37 and his expedition members , will be searching densely forested areas in the island ’s north and south west			1
‘ if we did n’t think there was even a slim chance of stumbling upon evidence in the form of droppings , hair or footage then we would n’t have committed to this expedition , ’ said mr @entity37			0
‘ @entity107 sightings are still being reported right across the state of @entity6 , 27 years after it was declared extinct by the @entity6 government			2
’ the team will be using two powerful four - wheel - drive vehicles which will be loaded with cameras , dashboard video cameras and powerful binoculars			0
the thylacine is believed to have roamed the @entity118 mainland in ancient times before it became extinct there about 2,000 years ago - but it continued to thrive in @entity6			2
but the arrival of @entity121 sealed its fate			0
the animal was hunted for its fur and because it was responsible for attacks on settlers ’ sheep , resulting in alarming photographs showing gunmen standing proudly beside the corpses of piles of animals they had shot down			0
with the death of the last known tiger - referred to as @entity107 - in the @entity41 zoo in 1936 , all that has remained of the elusive animal in recent times has been reported sightings in isolated parts of @entity6			1
while there have been reported sightings of the tiger , known scientifically as a thylacine , the scientists said the evidence has never been strong enough to be convincing			2

the last known @entity6 tiger - called @entity107 - died in captivity in @entity153 on the island state in 1936
enthusiasts believe there is still a chance that several of the animals might still be roaming the forested regions of @entity6
@entity2 scientists dr @entity18 and @entity19 , who will begin their search for the tiger from today , said there have been sightings of animal
