by @entity0 published : 14:29 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 13:52 est , 17 december 2012 most dogs get excited when they sniff out a juicy bone			2
but @entity3 , a two - year - old @entity4 , shows enthusiasm for a far more unusual reason			1
the perceptive pooch has been trained to sniff out the hospital superbug @entity8 in patients , with great success			1
by simply sniffing around a hospital bed , he can detect whether patients are carrying the deadly infection			1
@entity3 's detection abilities were first put to the test on stool samples , which have a distinct odour when someone has the bug			1
after two months of training at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity3 was able to correctly identify all 50 samples from infected patients and 47 out of 50 negative samples			2
and his impressive work did n't stop there			0
on one hospital visit he was able to sniff out 25 out of 30 infected patients simply by smelling the air around their beds , while correctly deducing that 265 out of 270 patients did not carry the infection			1
when he detects a patient with the superbug , he sits by the patient 's bed to alert doctor			2
those who are passed by are deemed by @entity3 not to be infected			0
but the hardest part , say the researchers , is getting him to sit still			0
dr @entity55 , who helped train @entity3 , said : ' we go into all the rooms , and it is intended that @entity3 quietly sits by the bed of patients who are infected			0
' but this is the most difficult thing for him to do as he gets very excited when he smells @entity62			0
' now , on the back of this success , the @entity64 researchers suggest that more animals could be trained to screen hospital wards in an effort to prevent @entity8 outbreaks			1
in a study , published in the online journal bmj.com , the @entity64 team wrote : ' it is feasible to use a dog to detect @entity8 in stool samples and in patients			1
he 's got the bug : @entity3 enjoys the challenge of sniffing out @entity8 ' the dog 's diagnostic accuracy with stool samples suggests that immediate identification of @entity8 is possible			1
moreover , our data suggest that the same may be true for the rapid diagnosis of c difficile infection on clinical wards			2
' for the purposes of detection , the dog did not need a stool sample or physical contact with patients			0
' it would seem dogs can detect @entity8 in the air surrounding patients			1
in addition , dogs are quick and efficient : patients in a hospital ward can be screened for the presence of @entity8 infection in less than 10 minutes			1
' the researchers did admit that the study has limitations and said that using a dog as a diagnostic tool is not ' fully predictable '			0
but there 's no doubting @entity3 's enthusiasm for the task , which is shared by his father @entity115			0
primarily a police sniffer dog , he also enjoys sniffing out the superbug ' it was not the intention to train him in this , because he is a ' crime scene ' sniffer dog , but he trains at home spontaneously along with @entity3 , ' said dr @entity55			2
@entity8 is the most commonly diagnosed bacterial cause of infectious hospital - acquired diarrhoea in developed countries			1
it can cause diarrhoea ranging from mild symptoms to a very severe illness and can be fatal			0
certain groups of people are particularly at risk of developing c diff			0
these include the elderly , those who have recently had surgery , and people with serious underlying diseases			0
the bacterium can be transmitted through either personal contact or the environment .			0

by sniffing around hospital beds , two - year - old @entity4 can identify deadly infection @entity8
bug gives stools a distinctive odour , which a dog 's *sensitive* nose can detect
hound has *astonishing* success rate of nearly 100 per cent
his @entity64 trainers now say more dogs could be used in fight against hospital infections
