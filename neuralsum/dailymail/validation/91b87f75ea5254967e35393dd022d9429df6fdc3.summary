when @entity1 waved a short putter to magical effect during the first round of the @entity5 at @entity6 on thursday , he effectively consigned to history one of the most contentious subjects the game has known			1
nine months ahead of the official death knell for long putters , the great and good have seemingly imposed their own sanction			2
the banishment was started by @entity14 and @entity15 , who snapped his over his knee to ensure he would not be tempted any more			0
then came @entity17 , leaving @entity1 as the last man standing in terms of players who won majors using a long putter			1
@entity23 @entity1 putts for birdie on the eighth green during the @entity5 @entity1 watches his tee shot on the 14th hole in the second round of the @entity5 it was this group who forced the hands of the governing bodies when they claimed all four majors between them in the space of just 18 months , from @entity17 's @entity37 triumph in 2011 through to @entity39 victory in 2013			1
the authorities were persuaded by the powerful evidence that less nerve was needed in anchoring a long putter to the body and the plain inequity that such a crutch could prove decisive at a major			2
hence the ban on anchoring which , by extension , meant the end for long putters			0
@entity1 was the most high - profile since his long putter was the ugliest contraption of all			1
as long as he kept turning up with it in his bag , the subject rumbled on			0
it was during a three - month break that the genial @entity23 decided it was time to change			0
his caddie @entity61 had announced his retirement while @entity1 's wife had given birth to their first child , @entity65			2
' everything was getting a little boring so i thought why not change everything completely and ditch the putter as well , ' said @entity1 ( right ) , wryly			1
at home he experimented with a range of 50 different putters			0
he tried various grips and methods			0
by the time he arrived in @entity77 , @entity1 was confident enough to announce he was going back to the short putter he last wielded in competition in 2011			1
@entity1 plays his second shot on the 10th hole in the second round of the @entity5 the @entity23 chips the ball out of the bunker and onto the 11th green at the @entity5 the 34 - year - old admitted to some first - hole nerves and genuine concern as to how it would hold up over long putts			1
as things turned out , it went better than he could have imagined			0
using the ' claw ' grip favoured by @entity96 , the putting stroke looked pure and he had just 27 putts in an opening round of 70			0
' i 'm really pleased , ' @entity1 said afterwards			2
' i 've tried not to clutter my mind and i 've shown myself it is not that big a deal			0
it helps that i used a short putter for years , so the adjustment was really to do with muscle memory			1
' one or two middle - ranking players such as the @entity110 @entity109 and @entity112 @entity111 still use long putters			0
but even here they will surely take encouragement from the example of those at the top			0
as for @entity1 , did he ever feel like following @entity120 's example and snapping his putter in two ? ' it treated me pretty well , so i do n't think it deserves a snapping , ' he said , smiling			1
@entity1 's two - under - par round left him in the top 10 but still eight strokes behind runaway leader @entity128 , who carded a 62			1
' that 's the most unbelievable round i have ever seen , ' said @entity130 , who opened with a 74 â€” one worse than world no 1 @entity131			2
for @entity128 , it was another heartening milestone in his remarkable recovery from brain surgery three years ago			0
the 34 - year - old @entity1 watches his tee shot on the 12th hole at the @entity5			1

@entity1 is now using a short putter at the @entity5
the *transition* has gone very *smoothly* for the @entity143 masters champion
he shot two under round off the back of a strong short game at @entity6
short putters will be *introduced* across golf by *january* 1 , 2016
