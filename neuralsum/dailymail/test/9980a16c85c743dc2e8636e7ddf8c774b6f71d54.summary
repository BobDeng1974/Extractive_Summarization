most women would kill for a size six figure and a gap between their thighs			2

the illness has seen miss @entity4 lose more than 18 stone ( 252lbs ) in 20 months , as she regularly vomits up her food and suffers excruciating bowel pain			1
at her largest , when she weighed 27st 10lbs ( 388lbs ) and was a size 32 , she dreamed of pulling off skimpy outfits			1
but now , weighing just 8st 9lbs ( 121lbs ) and wearing size 6 clothes , she says she would give anything to get back her fuller figure back and be able to eat normally again			1
she developed crohn 's disease and lost 18 stone in 20 months to become a slim size six ( right )			1
but rather than being delighted at her new figure , she describes her situation as a ' nightmare ' her condition leaves her in constant pain and she can barely keep food down , so she can never enjoy eating or go out for dinner with her friends			1
she so tired from being malnourished she can not work , and her fingernails , eyebrows and hair all regularly fall out			0
miss @entity4 , of @entity39 , @entity40 , said : ' i get lots of compliments on my figure , but i have constant , underlying pain			1

eating feels like a chore because i know it 's going to cause me pain			1

' miss @entity4 was a happy and healthy child but her weight began to increase through her teens despite making no change to her diet			1
miss @entity4 says her ' dream body ' is actually a nightmare as she can not eat and vomits daily by the age of 14 , she was dubbed ' @entity23 ' by playground bullies			1
she said : ' i ate whatever mum gave me , which was healthy because she was always watching her weight			2
' as my waistline expanded , my confidence shrank and it was n't until i left school - and the bullies - behind me that i stopped worrying about my size			1
' at college , i ate what i wanted and although i reached nearly 28 stone , i still made an effort with my clothes , hair and make - up			1
@entity86 did n't have to mean ugly			2
' with the humiliation of her school days behind her , miss @entity4 gradually started to embrace her size 32 frame			1
but then shortly after her 17th birthday , having finally made peace with being overweight , she fell seriously ill. she said : ' i started vomiting 10 times a day			0
i just could n't keep anything down			2

in june 2014 , after months of tests , her doctor diagnosed her with @entity9 's disease , a long - term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system			1
there is currently no cure for @entity9 's disease - treatment simply aims to relieve the symptoms of the digestive system becoming inflamed			1
miss @entity4 was immediately prescribed a cocktail of pills , which she is required to take every day			1
she said : ' on a good day i have to take up to 70 pills , but it can go up to 100 on a bad one			0

she said : ' i 'll never be big again			0
i can only keep down around 10 per cent of what i eat , and right now i 'm even struggling to keep down water			2
' before the sickness started , miss @entity4 would tuck into a healthy bowl of cereal for breakfast			2
before being diagnosed with @entity9 's disease , miss @entity4 had four jobs			1
now , she is so tired she can not work			0
she said : ' i know it sounds unbelievable , but i 'd give anything to be 27 stone again ' for lunch she 'd have a salad or a sandwich , and dinner was a meal cooked by her mother , such as a healthy portion of spaghetti bolognese made with reduced fat @entity144 mince			2
now , her condition means she can not eat fats or oils			2
she has not eaten junk food for the past three years and has been on a strict diet of boiled meat and vegetables			0
