by @entity0 published : 08:42 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 19:44 est , 7 march 2013 the handwritten notes which saved the lives of the astronauts on the @entity5 mission are set to fetch £ 60,000 at auction			1
the notes , made famous by the hit 1995 film starring @entity10 , were used by commander @entity11 to work out how to perform a vital ' burn ' on the way back to @entity14			1
if commander @entity11 had got the sums wrong then it is likely that he and his fellow astronauts , @entity19 and @entity20 , would have perished in space			1
the explosion caused another tank to fail , seriously jeopardizing the three - man crew 's ability to return home			2
astronaut @entity20 famously said ' @entity38 , we 've had a problem here ' after the explosion , according to a @entity41 history of the flight			0
the crew was forced to move into the lunar landing module for the return flight			0
@entity11 's calculations on the checklist were key in the survival of the three astronauts on board			1
the world was said to have held its breath after @entity5 suffered an explosion on its way to the @entity55 in april 1970			0
the blast left the spacecraft crippled , prompting the famous line ' @entity38 , we 've had a problem ' from commander @entity11			1
despite facing great difficulties due to limited power , plummeting temperatures , shortage of water and rising carbon dioxide levels the crew returned safely to @entity14 four days later			0
the single sheet on which commander @entity11 's notes were written is actually page 30 of the @entity5 contingency checklist			1
he used the sheet to record critical spacecraft altitude procedures to allow the crew to accurately perform the hugely important ' mid-course correction burn number five '			1
the burn was designed to fire the engine up enough to boost the spacecraft 's speed another 860 feet per second			2
this meant the crew would get back to @entity14 quicker which would greatly enhance their chances of survival			0
the burn forms a key scene in @entity86 's @entity85 - winning @entity5 film , in which commander @entity11 tries to keep the @entity14 in the spacecraft 's window while performing the manoeuvre			1
the original crew of @entity5 were @entity11 , @entity91 and @entity19 ( pictured left to right )			1
@entity91 missed the mission due to illness as the crippled spacecraft 's navigation equipment was not working correctly the commander used the @entity14 as a reference point			0
if the craft had been pointing in the wrong direction at the time of the burn the crew would likely have been shot into space with no hope of correcting their course to return home			1
the sheet , which contains commander @entity11 's hand - written notes , is being sold by mr @entity19 , who is now 79 - years - old and living in @entity110			1
last year a new law was introduced in the @entity112 that allowed @entity5 - era astronauts to keep items from their missions			2
although they were told they could keep certain things by their managers , there was always uncertainty over the issue which made it difficult for them to sell items at auction			2
@entity127 , specialist in space history at @entity129 , said : ‘ the crew had to abort the mission to land on the @entity55 because of the explosion			0
@entity5 13 eventually came back to @entity14 and landed in the @entity133 ‘ they were using the lunar module as a lifeboat and all of the standard procedures went out of the window			0
‘ the crew were getting constant instructions from @entity141			0
that is why they are covered in the annotations			0
it is very , very unusual to have so many annotations			0
‘ anything flown on @entity5 is rare but something like this with the annotations from @entity11 and @entity19 is rarer still			1
‘ it gives us an interesting insight into the atmosphere inside the spacecraft			0
’ the apollo space program was responsible for putting the first man on the moon			0
it was the @entity159 mission which saw astronauts @entity160 and @entity162 walk on the moon on july 20 , 1969			2
the @entity5 programme was abandoned in 1972 due to budget cuts			0
the note is being sold by @entity129 in @entity167 on march 25			1
@entity10 played @entity11 in the 1995 film about the @entity5 mission			2

the notes were used by @entity11 to work out how to perform a vital ' burn '
they are *expected* to fetch £ 60,000 at auction in @entity167
if @entity11 had got the sums wrong the astronauts would probably have died
