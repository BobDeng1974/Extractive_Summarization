@entity0 has revealed @entity2 ’s arrival has been key to his development and helped him become @entity5 ’s most improved player			1
the @entity6 international has thrived since @entity8 has been at @entity9 and he produced another accomplished display against @entity11 on thursday , scoring the final goal in a 3 - 0 win			0
@entity0 has been on a hot streak in this campaign – that was his fifth in 12 appearances – but his all - round play has been just as striking as his goal scoring and he puts that down to being able to play and train alongside @entity2			1
former @entity20 man @entity0 has already scored five goals in 12 appearances for @entity5 this season @entity0 said being able to watch @entity2 in training has been a huge boost to his development goal 1 : scored in 2 - 2 draw with @entity26 goal 2 : scored in 2 - 2 draw with @entity29 goal 3 : scored in 6 - 3 defeat by @entity32 goal 4 : scored in 2 - 1 defeat by @entity35 goal 5 : scored in 3 - 0 win against @entity11 @entity2 has made a big impression on @entity5 ’s squad , most notably with how he approaches training every day , and @entity0 says he and @entity40 are certainly feeling the benefits			1
@entity0 said : ‘ the two of them work closely in training and so every day he is seeing him , the way he moves , and seeing where he takes his touches and it is definitely going to help him			1
it is not as if they go and do specific things together , it is just general , off – the – cuff stuff that @entity2 does that @entity53 will be catching onto and hopefully taking into his game			2
‘ but without a doubt it does help watching someone like @entity2			2
it ’s not like you are sitting down chatting to him and analysing the whole way he has played throughout his career			0
‘ it ’s just watching what they do on a day - to - day basis			0
there might be some sessions when @entity2 is scoring a lot of goals , so you are picking up on how he is getting into the positions to score those goals			1
@entity0 was signed by @entity73 but has really flourished since @entity8 took charge at @entity9 @entity0 said that £ 28million summer signing @entity40 also feels the benefit of training with @entity2 ‘ watching him is definitely helping me and with @entity79 ( @entity80 ) helping with the squad as well giving you pointers we have great people around us that are going to make us better players			1
’ @entity0 took time to find his feet after he arrived as a free agent in june 2012 but he has not looked back since @entity8 arrived			2
he has 19 months left on his current contract and it is highly likely he will stay beyond that			0
@entity8 said : ' i love watching @entity0 play			2
i think the way he is adapting in different positions , even during games , he has an incredible intelligence			0
the football intelligence that he has is quite refreshing and important in our squad			0
‘ but it is important we keep focusing on the games and as i say behind the scenes we always keep an eye on every individual situation			0
