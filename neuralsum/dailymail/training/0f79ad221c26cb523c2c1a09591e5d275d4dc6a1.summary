mr @entity49 added : ' between 9am and 7pm , she did n't show any signs of any fit whatsoever , she just looked like someone who was feeling ill. she said , " i just want to sleep it off dad			1
" ' then she was making noises which gave us cause for concern , that 's when we decided that it was something more serious '			0
he added : ' i found out after her death that she had n't been taking her medication			1
i was always under the impression she was taking it			0
' she made out that she had an appointment at the job centre or something , she was a bit vague about the appointments			0
she said " i 'm not going , i have got to go somewhere else "			0
' shocked : @entity7 's parents , @entity82 and @entity49 ( pictured leaving the inquest ) , tried to get their daughter to see the doctor and did n't realise she had n't been taking her tablets paramedic @entity87 , whose ambulance was directed to the scene , arrived at the house at 10.56pm on august 7 , last year			1

' she would scream a bit and look at me , but her eyes were vacant			0
' her parents said they had n't seen her all day - her parents thought that she had food poisoning , they thought she had been vomiting all day			2
' the paramedic requested back - up before administering diazepam and adrenaline , which calmed @entity7 , but she then suffered another fit which saw her heart rate dramatically drop			1
' it was a sudden change and one that i did n't expect to occur			0
her father helped me get her on the floor and i checked her pulse and breathing			0
' she had no pulse and was n't breathing '			0
