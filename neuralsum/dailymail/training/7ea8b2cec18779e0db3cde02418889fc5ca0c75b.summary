by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today admitted the @entity3 have more to do to defeat @entity4 , despite romping home to victory in the @entity7 by - election			1
the prime minister warned the @entity11 ' the job is n't finished yet ' on hammering home key messages on the economy , tax cuts and jobs			2
@entity17 candidate @entity16 held on to the @entity19 seat with a majority of 7,403 , halting the march of @entity4 's @entity22 which @entity23 had boasted was on the verge of securing its first mp			1
@entity48 's @entity47 was pushed into third place with 6,842 votes , ahead of independent candidate @entity51 , who finished with 1,891 , and the @entity53 's @entity52 who attracted 1,037 votes			1
it was a disastrous night for the @entity56 however , whose candidate @entity57 was beaten into a humiliating sixth place , barely scraping 1,000 votes			1
the contest was triggered by the resignation of disgraced former mp @entity63 , and had been seen as a crucial test of @entity23 ’s ability to secure an historic first @entity4 mp in the @entity37			1
however the @entity17 majority was more than halved from 16,000 in 2010 , with @entity4 surging from a distant fifth place in that election , taking an additional 10,000 votes this time around			1
@entity70 will hope that the result will quell fears on the @entity17 backbenches that the party can hold back the @entity4 tide at the general election in may 2015			2
but speaking in @entity39 ahead of d - day commemoration events , mr @entity2 said more had to be done to tackle the threat from @entity4 in the run - up to the 2015 general election			2
he told reporters : ' we need to work between now and the next election to say very clearly we have got a long - term plan , we are getting @entity85 back to work , we are cutting people 's taxes , we are helping hard - working people			0
' the job is n't finished yet but we are on the right track , let 's stick at it			2
' @entity4 secured a swing of 22.1 per cent , with the @entity56 down 17.4 per cent on another dreadful night for @entity96 's party hundreds of @entity17 activists flooded into the seat in a bid to secure victory over @entity4 defeated : @entity46 ( left ) and @entity23 ( right ) arrive to hear the results			1
despite finishing second , the @entity4 leader said ' tremors are still being felt ' two weeks after the party 's @entity105 election triumph new mp mr @entity16 said : ' the people of @entity7 have voted to back this government , to back this government 's long - term economic plan to secure the future of this constituency and of this great country			1
' mr @entity23 sought to put a brave face on the @entity17 victory , insisting @entity4 had made ' huge gains '			1
speaking after the result , mr @entity23 said : ' i think there 'll be an awful lot of conservatives with a majority of less than 10,000 who will look upon this result in sheer horror			1
' but he admitted he would have liked to have done better in @entity7			0
' yes , i mean the majority 's halved and we thought we 'd bitten into it even more than that , but nonetheless for @entity129 it 's still a good night 's work , ' he said			2
denying he should have spent more time in the constituency , he said : ‘ @entity4 is about much more than @entity23			1
’ mr @entity2 made four visits to the seat , including a tour with @entity136 , in an attempt to seal victory			0
by contrast mr @entity23 visited just once during the campaign			1
@entity2 hailed the victory , insisting mr @entity16 would ' deliver a brighter future for all ' @entity2 visited the seat four times , including touring a street market with @entity146 mayor @entity136 the @entity3 flooded the constituency with activists and mps to prove the party machine could see off the threat from @entity4 the result will be a setback for mr @entity23 , who had hoped to use victory in the @entity156 elections last month as a springboard to gaining a seat in @entity159			1
he promised to do ‘ everything we can ’ to win the by - election , declaring : ‘ the people ’s army of @entity4 now marches on @entity7			1
’ however , on the eve of the vote the @entity4 leader was pictured partying in @entity168 after giving a speech to the tourism industry			2
the by - election was triggered by the resignation of disgraced mp @entity63 , who faced being suspended from the @entity37 after being caught in a lobbying sting it suggested he had all but given up hope of seizing the @entity3 ’ 44th safest seat			0
yesterday he was pictured walking hand - in - hand into a hotel with a tourism executive but he insisted today : ' i did n't go to bed with her '			0
the @entity4 leader claimed he was the victim of ' abhorrent mischief making ' after he was photographed with @entity185 at 3.42am after a gala dinner in @entity168			2
@entity4 strategists hoped to use @entity7 to mimic the success of the @entity189 in @entity190 which used a by - election as a springboard to becoming a dominant political force			2
local teacher @entity194 won @entity189 's first seat in @entity156 in 1989 , and four years later the party overtook the @entity11 as the main right - wing party mr @entity23 was accused of ‘ bottling it ’ after refusing to stand in the by - election himself , claiming he did not want to cause a ‘ huge distraction ’ from the @entity202 election campaign			1
he reportedly told the @entity203 that if he lost @entity4 would be finished : ' the bubble is burst			1
' he stepped aside in favour of @entity46 , who was elected as an @entity206 for @entity4 last month			2
many @entity3 despaired when the contest was called after mr @entity63 ’s sudden resignation			0
the outspoken critic of mr @entity2 quit the @entity17 party in july last year after he was exposed as having accepted £ 4,000 to ask parliamentary questions and lobby on behalf of @entity212			0
he referred himself to parliamentary commissioner for standards and promised to quit the @entity37 at the next election			0
but in april it emerged the standards watchdog was going to recommend he be suspended from the @entity37 for six months , so he fell on his sword			0
the former @entity22 colonel said that as an ex-soldier he believes that when you have done something wrong you should confess to it			0
he added : ‘ no point in shilly - shallying or trying to avoid it			0
what has happened has happened , i ’m ashamed of it			0
therefore , i ’m going to do what i can to put it right			0
i ’m going to resign my seat			0
’ the market town of @entity7 lies on the @entity231 in @entity19 has been held by the @entity3 since 2001 @entity7 is a largely rural constituency which , since @entity63 was elected in 2001 , has been considered a safe conservative seat			2
centred on the affluent cathedral town of @entity31 and the market town of @entity7 , and dissected by the @entity231 , around half of the area 's 72,000 voters live in villages and rural areas			0
it borders @entity48 - held @entity241 in the north and lies to the north east of a number of @entity48 - voting constituencies in the city of @entity247			1
but unlike @entity19 's more urban areas , @entity7 has a traditionally conservative - voting population , like that of its two neighbouring @entity252 constituencies , @entity251 and @entity253 and @entity254 , which border it to the east			0
@entity7 's electorate is 93 per cent white @entity85 , and 67 per cent describe themselves as @entity258 , with less than one per cent considering themselves @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 or @entity263			0
more than 70 per cent of homes in the constituency either owned outright or mortgaged , less than 10 per cent of households have council or housing association tenants and only 20 per cent of the electorate are younger than 34			0
well over half of voters are employed , with nearly one in five retired and only three per cent unemployed			0
traditionally @entity17 , it was held by the party for the first half of the 20th century , but swung to @entity48 after the war , with @entity277 @entity276 and @entity278 representing it from 1950 to 1979			1
it swung back to the conservatives in 1979 , with @entity17 @entity282 holding the seat until 1997 , when @entity48 's @entity284 won a slim majority as @entity286 swept to power			1
mrs @entity284 could only hold the seat for one term however and mr @entity63 won it back for the @entity3 in 2001			0
at the last election , the @entity3 won 54 per cent of the vote , giving them a huge majority over @entity48 , who polled at only 24 per cent .			1

conservatives held on to the seat with a comfortable majority of 7,403
however that is less than half the 16,000 majority in 2010 @entity301
@entity4 finished a solid second , with @entity48 well behind in third place
disaster for @entity56 as they trailed in sixth , barely scraping 1,000 votes
@entity23 says : ' i do *n’t* think anyone would have expected us to win here '
but added that finishing in second place proves campaign ' *resonated* '
