by @entity0 @entity1 is planning to build a new @entity3 canal alongside the existing 145 - year - old waterway in a multi-billion pound bid to boost its economy			1
the 45 - mile corridor will expand what is the fastest shipping route between @entity9 and @entity10 and is part of several ' mega projects ' designed to breathe new life into the nation			1
warplanes flew overhead in a ceremony broadcast on state television from the canal city of @entity19 as @entity1 's president @entity20 officially launched the military - led scheme , set to cost £ 2.4bn			1
and although the initial time frame for completion was five years , @entity20 estimated it could be finished in just 12 months			0
@entity1 is the gatekeeper of the @entity24 , one of the world 's busiest water corridors and the strategic link between the @entity33 and the @entity34			1
the current @entity24 brings in around $ 5billion of revenues per year , a vital source of hard currency for @entity1 which has suffered a slump in tourism and foreign investment since its 2011 uprising			1
the first canal connecting the @entity34 and @entity56 via the @entity57 was dug in 1874 b.c. during the reign of the @entity1 pharaoh @entity60 it was abandoned and reopened several times over the subsequent 2,500 years			0
@entity62 inscriptions showed that @entity1 used the canals to move warships , send pilgrimages to the @entity66 and transport grain and stones used in ancient monuments			0
@entity70 sought to build a modern canal in order to undermine @entity74 's control of trading routes to @entity10 , but he abandoned the project after engineers wrongly determined that a difference in water levels would cause the @entity34 to be inundated			0
damaged ships are pictured in @entity1 's @entity81 , north of the historic waterway , during the @entity83 @entity85 diplomat @entity84 and @entity1 viceroy @entity86 developed the current @entity24 in the mid- 19th century			1
@entity85 and @entity1 private interests controlled the company entrusted with building and running the canal , though @entity74 later acquired @entity1 's share			0
completion of the 101 mile waterway took 10 years of intense and generally poorly - paid work by @entity1 who were drafted at the rate of 20,000 every 10 months from ' the peasantry			1
' the canal , which was opened for navigation on november 17 , 1869 , cut weeks if not months off journeys between @entity9 and @entity10 that otherwise necessitated a trip around @entity102			2
numerous heads of state visited @entity1 for weeks of celebrations			0
in 1956 , @entity1 president @entity105 nationalised the canal , leading to a failed invasion by @entity74 , which controlled the channel , as well as @entity85 and @entity109			0
the waterway was closed briefly until 1957 and the again for eight years following the 1967 war with @entity109			0
president @entity113 announced on tuesday that @entity1 would build a new channel as part of a larger project to expand port and shipping facilities around the canal in an effort to establish @entity1 as a major trade hub			2
but sources in the @entity123 have reportedly said the new canal will boost annual revenues to $ 13.5billion by 2023			1
to attract more ships and generate more income , the country has had plans to develop 29,000 square miles around the canal for years			0
' this giant project will be the creation of a new @entity24 parallel to the current channel of a total length of 72 kilometres ( 44.74 miles ) , ' @entity131 , chairman of the @entity123 , told a conference in @entity19			2
a couple watch the vast @entity140 aircraft carrier @entity141 pass through the @entity24 in 2007 on its way to @entity143			0
the new 45 - mile section will allow ships to pass for just under half of the 101 - mile canal a new @entity24 running alongside the existing one could be completed within five years - though @entity1 's president believes it could be finished in just 12 months @entity131 spoke at a conference in which president @entity113 is expected to announce a winning consortium to develop the project , which includes building an international industrial and logistics hub in the @entity24 area			1
he said the project would involve 21 miles of ' dry digging ' and 22 miles would be ' expansion and deepening ' , indicating the current @entity24 , which is 163 km ( 101 miles ) long , could also be widened as part of the project .			2

the new 45 - mile section would run alongside the existing @entity24
project could be complete in five years at a cost of more than £ *2.4billion*
101 - mile - long @entity3 is the fastest shipping link between @entity9 and @entity10
new waterway will allow ships to travel in both directions for half that length
@entity1 *authorities* believe it will boost annual revenues to $ 13.5billion
