@entity12 is seen sobbing with delight as she gladly accepts his proposal			0
@entity12 wrote on her blog afterwards how it was all a wonderful surprise			0
she said : ' i can say that it was quite a shock to be booked on a job and end up in the middle of a marriage proposal instead			0
@entity8 had been planning this since sometime in march and received help from my good bookers at @entity16 , so i really could not imagine			2
' i have no idea how they managed to keep everything secret so long			0
that he could go to @entity13 and back without me even noticing ? ' she added : ' i was stunned - @entity8 made the most romantic proposal in the world and i am one very lucky lady			1

he said : ' i wanted to take @entity12 away to propose in a romantic location , one of the classics , but since we had n't been on a holiday in a while i knew she would be suspicious			0
' i wanted to ask her @entity122 , @entity65 's , permission and did n't quite know how to do that , after many failed plans and attempts , it culminated in me booking a next day flight over to @entity130 , a half hour stopover and then a reverse journey back to @entity7 to avoid suspicions of me being out of the country			0
i 'm glad i did that , i know it means a lot to @entity65 and apart for a crazy journey , totally worth it			0
' then i came up with the idea of booking her on a ' fake ' job , with a lot of help from her entire agency at @entity16 , we came up with the perfect disguise , we managed to get her over to @entity6 after a little stopover flight , so i could get there before her and set everything up			0
' @entity150 at @entity151 ( the hotel ) helped with everything that side and before i had time to breathe she was arriving and i spent the time in the hotel 's basement hiding away in preparation for @entity12 to come down to meet the crew for her shoot ... then she got the @entity45 ... ' delighted : @entity12 could n't wait to call her friends and family and tell them the good news tying the knot : the couple will wed in december in @entity9 @entity166 : @entity12 's agency @entity16 helped @entity8 plan the surprise @entity12 said she and her friends and family were ' choked ' by the lengths @entity8 went to in order to pop the question			1
she added : ' my family is of course over the moon , i have four younger sisters who love it - their boyfriends , maybe not so much ! ' as @entity12 knows @entity8 loves to film and take pictures - mostly so they can share what they are up to with friends and family around the world - she was not surprised when she discovered he had recorded their proposal			1
' i 'm so glad he filmed everything , because now we have something to revisit when we want and that we can show our children in the future , ' she said			0
the original plan had been to only show the video to their friends and family and play it at their wedding , which will take place on @entity199 in @entity9			0
