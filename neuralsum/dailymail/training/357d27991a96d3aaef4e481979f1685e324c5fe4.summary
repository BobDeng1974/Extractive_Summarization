@entity0 admitted this defeat in his first match as @entity4 manager was one of the lowest moments of his career , but insisted his current group of players will escape relegation			1
the contrast with @entity0 ’s buoyancy at his unveiling last monday could not have been starker			1
@entity14 ’s penalty in the third minute past the 90 sapped the joy from @entity16 , on a day that became one of @entity19 ’s worst			1

@entity23 's late winner saw @entity0 lose his first game in charge of the goal - shy home side at @entity16 @entity14 celebrates his penalty that gave @entity23 a late winner at @entity16 as @entity30 lost his first game the match was heading for a draw until @entity33 made the miscalculation that saw @entity4 slip to a sixth successive @entity37 defeat			1
he brought down @entity14 in the area and received a red card for his troubles			1
so the bounce expected by owner @entity42 in appointing @entity0 failed to materialise			1
@entity4 actually dropped a place			2
their next games , against @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , must yield points			0

it ’s about delivering on match day			0

his performance on the left wing was full of energy and his header to open the scoring was dispatched like a striker who has been banging in goals all season			0
@entity61 said the squad exchanged heated words in the dressing room			0
‘ they came in shouting and there was all the stuff you think of when players are angry after conceding in the last minute , ’ he said			0
