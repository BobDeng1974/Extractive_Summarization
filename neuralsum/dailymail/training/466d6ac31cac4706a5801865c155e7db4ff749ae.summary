by @entity0 a bodybuilder struck down with a crippling bowel disease has become a male model - who proudly sports a colostomy bag			1
@entity5 was preparing to compete in a bodybuilding competition when he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis			1
the painful condition causes inflammation and ulceration of the inner lining of the rectum and colon , triggering symptoms such as diarrhoea and stomach cramps			1
the painful condition led him to having his colon removed and being fitted with a colostomy bag but he has now become a fitness model doctors warned the father - of - one after surgery that he would never be able to train at the level required to be a fitness model - but he decided to try anyway over the next decade , the devastated 33 - year - old was treated with a variety of drugs			1
but his condition meant he was constantly tired - and needing to go to the loo up to 20 times a day			1
he was also forced to give up his strict training regime - which had included two - hour gym sessions , six days a week - and lost two stone in weight as his muscle wasted away			1
by last october , his health had deteriorated so much that he required surgery			1
mr @entity5 was admitted to the @entity40 in @entity41 for a sub-total colectomy			2
this involved removing his entire colon before doctors performed an ileostomy - where the small intestine is diverted through an opening in the abdomen			1
he was fitted with a stoma bag on the outside of his body to collect waste			1
doctors also warned the father - of - one he would never be able to train at the level required to be a fitness model			1
he said : ' they said to start lifting weights and training to be a physique model would be very unattainable and unlikely			2
' i was warned there was a risk of hernias and other problems			2
' but determined to prove them wrong , he began a training regime in january , starting at a weight of 11st 12lbs			2
over the last six months he has bulked up to 13st 2lbs and has just appeared in ‘ @entity71 ’ magazine			0
and now a personal trainer , he hopes his progress will inspire others with stoma bags to have more confidence			1
he now plans to enter his first competition in the physique class of the @entity79 in october this year mr @entity5 after surgery last october			1
he said : ' when i came out of hospital , i had to get used to having a stoma			2
' i knew it was there , but found it hard to accept the fact i had this bag on my stomach and what it did ' @entity91 ( @entity91 ) is a condition that causes inflammation and ulceration of the inner lining of the rectum and colon ( the large bowel )			1
in @entity91 , tiny ulcers develop on the surface of the lining and these may bleed and produce pus			0
the inflamed colon is less able to absorb liquid and this can lead to a larger volume of watery stools			2
also , because the colon can not hold as much as usual , sufferers may have very frequent bowel movements ( six or more a day )			0
it ’s estimated that @entity91 affects about one in every 420 people in the @entity114			0
viruses , bacteria , diet and stress have all been suggested as environmental triggers , but there is no definite evidence that any one of these factors is the cause of @entity91			0
mr @entity5 , who lives with his girlfriend in @entity125 , @entity126 , said : ' i am determined to show people and society that having a stoma does n’t change who you are			1
' it does n’t mean you ’re not normal			0
you can achieve anything you want to do , you can be attractive , and you can lead a normal life			0
' he admits that it took some time to get used to his new appearance			0
' when i came out of hospital , i had to get used to having a stoma , ' he said			0
' i knew it was there , but found it hard to accept the fact i had this bag on my stomach and what it did			0
' it was strange because i did n’t even want to show my family at first			2
' it took a while to build my confidence again , to talk to people openly about having a stoma , to show anyone what i had			1
' but over time i realised " this is me "			0
' the operation had also made me feel like a new person			0
my energy levels were much better and i could enjoy life more			0
' he now plans to enter his first competition in the physique class of the @entity79 in october this year			0
he added : ' after the surgery i remember thinking if i would be happy even if i could just potter around the garden or spend time with my friends and family			0
' i never thought i would be able to get in this shape and be competing for the first time			0
