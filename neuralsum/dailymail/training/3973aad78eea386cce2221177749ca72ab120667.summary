over in @entity1 , where it is practically a crime to grow old , @entity0 is in constant danger of being arrested by the youth police			1
‘ just yesterday , ’ she writes in the introduction to her endearingly dotty memoir about the ups and downs of ageing , ‘ @entity5 , my 18 - year - old daughter , found a story online called “ @entity14 ”			1
’ number 1 on the roll - call of shame was @entity18 ( ‘ she looks like @entity19 from @entity20 ’ )			1
at number 4 , @entity22 ( ‘ what can i say about this genetic mistake ? ’ ) pretty fabulous : @entity0 is still a big name in @entity1 , despite the lack of roles for women her age ‘ @entity5 kept scrolling , ’ @entity30 continues , ‘ and there was the fifth - ugliest female celebrity			1
@entity0 : “ how this chick got a lead role in anything is beyond me			2
it ’s not because she ’s as old as dirt			2
she ’s even ugly in the @entity38 when she was young			2
” ’ ‘ wow , ’ @entity30 thinks — a remarkably restrained reaction in the circumstances			1
but after the initial shock , she rallies bravely : ‘ these old - as - dirt days have one advantage : i ’ve learned to see beauty where i never saw it before			1
when i was in my 20s and 30s i wanted my appearance to be more interesting than the beauty that surrounded me			2
it was a fool ’s folly			2
’ to an outsider , @entity30 ’s life seems to have been pretty fabulous so far			1
for those of us old enough to remember @entity54 , @entity55 ’s 1977 semi-autobiographical movie based on his relationship with @entity30 , she is forever the adorable , ditzy girl whose tomboy get - up inspired a generation to dress in their grandfather ’s cast - offs — baggy trousers , men ’s shirts and woolly waistcoats , topped with a bowler hat			1
at 68 , she is still working , pursuing her interests in photography and property development alongside an acting career that cheerfully disproves the adage about there being no roles for older women in @entity1			1
and at an age when most people would be settling gratefully into grandparenthood , she is the single parent of two children — an 18 - year - old daughter , @entity5 , whom she adopted in 1996 , followed in 2001 by a son , @entity79 , now 12			1
@entity81 chic : in @entity54 with @entity55 in 1977 yet as @entity30 tells it , she has been a martyr to low self - esteem since she was a little girl			1
these days we may suspect that she suffers from a more sophisticated variant of the syndrome — faux low self - esteem , widely adopted by successful celebrities in an attempt to stop their public from detesting them			1
but her account of her insecurity as a young woman makes painful reading			2
in her earlier memoir , then again , she wrote about her struggles with bulimia in her 20s			1
this time she recalls her teenage obsession with her imperfect looks			2
on august 8 , 1960 , aged 14 , she wrote a list of beauty ‘ corrections ’ in her diary			1
sleep with a bobby pin stuck on tip of my nose			2
tilt it to the left where the bulb is fat			2
spend time practising a series of smiles			2
exercise my eyes for 30 minutes a day			0
open them as wide as possible , then shut them tight			0
try exercising in @entity121 class where mrs @entity122 is frequently distracted			0
alas , the bobby pin left a mark on her nose that took half an hour to wear off , and when she practised her smile on a boy she fancied , the results were disappointing : ‘ as i slowly turned my face to his and smiled with a glow that came from the heart , he said : ‘ hey , @entity136 , what ’s the matter ? you look weird			0
” ’ @entity30 suffered 26 tooth cavities as a result of bulimia the failure of the ‘ corrections ’ to improve her looks did nothing to deter her from a lifelong campaign to ‘ right my wrongs ’			1
the struggle with her hair , she writes , ‘ has dogged me all my life ’			0
the solution — a multifarious assortment of wigs , berets and assorted headgear — had the handy side - effect of disguising her ears			1
‘ because , let ’s face it , my ears were , and remain , just one more of my many disappointments			0
’ you ’d think that having spent so long in @entity1 , a neighbourhood more densely populated with plastic surgeons than anywhere in the world , @entity30 might have been tempted to take advantage of their skills			1
but she claims to have resisted : ‘ the question is , how far am i willing to go ? particularly at this age			0
i ca n’t say exactly why i have n’t turned to surgery or fillers , at least not yet			0
maybe i do n’t want to change my everyday me because i ca n’t picture what i will look like			0
i tell myself to hold on to authenticity			0
but am i authentic ?			0
all i know is i ’m sick of worrying about my authenticity			0
’ the theme of loss permeates @entity30 ’s book — lost looks , lost love , lost dignity , lost homes ( try as she may , she ca n’t stop herself from moving every couple of years )			1
sweet stuff : @entity0 's memoir is endearingly quirky and unexpectedly wise there is a memorably bonkers vignette of herself , walking backwards with her long - suffering dog , @entity200 , on the advice of dr @entity202 , her acupuncturist , who assures her that it will ‘ employ the unutilised part of my brain ’ , thus warding off dementia			1
alas , while warding off dementia , she falls over a rock and breaks her toe			0
this is the fifth time it has happened , thanks to her penchant for walking around without shoes , to the intense chagrin of her son , who declines to be seen with her when she is shoeless			0
especially when she goes jogging barefoot , clasping a mug of @entity222 with ice ( ‘ i never jog without a chaser of red wine on the rocks ’ )			0
still , for every minor disaster , there is a sunny upside			0
in the chapter headed @entity228 — an adorably inconsequential celebration of her friendships with ‘ 65 and older showbusiness folk ’ , @entity30 takes a day off filming with @entity232 and @entity233 to hang out in @entity234			1
‘ i had a few hours to kill , so i took a chance and called @entity55 , [ and ] asked him if he wanted to take a walk on @entity237 , like we used to			0
’ around 79th street , ‘ we ran into @entity239 and his wife , @entity241 gathered around us			0
it was almost like it used to be , only sweeter , because i knew it could n’t last			0
’ come to think of it , if you were summing up the essence of the ditzy , barefoot , backwards - walking , 68 - year - old author of this endearingly quirky and unexpectedly wise memoir , you could hardly do better			1
@entity0 — almost like she used to be , only sweeter			0
out of an abandoned drawer			0
a beautiful book for all ages .			0
