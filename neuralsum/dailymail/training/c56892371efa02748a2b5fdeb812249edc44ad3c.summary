by @entity0 published : 09:16 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 11:00 est , 1 march 2013 @entity1 has revealed a stunning video showing @entity4 rotating , revealing the crater filled surface of the planet in unprecedented quality			1
the false color view of @entity10 was produced by putting together thousands of of images obtained by @entity1 's @entity10 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 ( known as messenger ) spacecraft , which is in orbit around the innermost planet			1
the planet , which in reality is brown , has been enhanced by engineers to reveal the huge variation in the planet 's surface , revealing both fresh and old craters			1
watch the amazing video below the amazing animation shows the surface of @entity10 in unprecedented detail , with fresh craters next to massive ancient impact craters messenger is the first spacecraft ever to orbit the planet @entity10			1
the spacecraft 's seven scientific instruments and radio science investigation are unraveling the history and evolution of the planet closest to the @entity43 during its one - year primary mission , @entity33 acquired 88,746 images			1
it is now in an extended mission , during which plans call for the acquisition of more than 80,000 additional images			2
' color variations on @entity10 's surface are subtle , and to the human eye @entity10 would appear to be varying shades of dark brown , ' @entity1 said			1
engineers used eight color filters on the spacecraft 's camera to accentuate real color variations that are linked to the composition and texture of materials on the surface			2
areas with a redder color appear red , and areas with a grayer color appear blue			0
' this view of the surface captures both compositional differences and differences in how long materials have been exposed at @entity10 's surface , ' the space agency said			0
young crater rays , arrayed radially around fresh impact craters , appear light blue or white			0
medium - and dark - blue areas are a geologic unit of @entity10 's crust known as the ' low - reflectance material ' , thought to be rich in a dark , opaque mineral			0
@entity85 areas are plains formed by eruption of highly fluid lavas			0
the large circular area in the northern hemisphere is the @entity92 impact basin , whose interior is filled with smooth , somewhat younger volcanic plains			0
the images reveal giant craters on the surface of @entity10 seen in unprecedented detail			0
this basin 's outer rim is about 306 km in diameter and the inner ( peak ) ring is about 140 km in diameter the images were created using a mosaic of pictures from @entity1 's messenger spacecraft , which were then combined to create a video ' flyby ' of the planet small orangish spots are materials deposited by explosive volcanic eruptions			1
the project is part of a global color map that covers more than 99 % of @entity10 's surface with an average resolution of about 1 kilometer per pixel			0
the view here is what an observer would see from high above the equator			0
these color images of @entity10 's surface were obtained when the spacecraft was viewing @entity10 with the @entity43 overhead , so shadows cast by topographic features are barely visible			1
other image mosaics of @entity10 were taken with the @entity43 low to the horizon , creating shading to accentuate topography			2
unlike @entity1 's @entity137 , which will be sampling rocks and soils to look for organic materials directly , the @entity33 probe bounces laser beams , counts particles , measures gamma rays and collects other data remotely from orbit .			2

mosaics were created with thousands of images taken by orbiting @entity1 spacecraft
image has been false coloured - the planet is actually brown
