by @entity0 published : 02:13 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 02:14 est , 9 july 2012 pensioners who continue to work should pay @entity2 which could then be passed on as tax breaks to firms who employ young workers , a @entity8 mp said today			1
@entity9 said the extra revenue could also be passed on directly to young low - paid workers in the form of a national insurance holiday			1
with the removal of the default retirement age , more people are expected to work for longer but those over 65 who continue in employment do not currently pay @entity2 on their earnings			1
extra revenue : pensioners who continue to work should pay @entity2 which could then be passed on as tax breaks to firms who employ young workers , a @entity8 mp said according to @entity24 estimates , up to £ 2billion could be raised by changing the rules so pensioners pay @entity2			1
ms @entity9 said the extra revenue could be passed on to under - 25s on less than £ 20,000 - a - year			1
she said it could be worth an extra £ 375 - a - year to an 18 - year - old on the minimum wage of £ 4.98 - an - hour , while saving their employer £ 450			2
for a 21 - year - old , it would be £ 675 more per year and save the employer £ 800			0
the backbench mp for @entity36 said she was hopeful the idea could be adopted , particularly if the chancellor @entity38 merges @entity39 and @entity2			1
ms @entity9 said : ' for those who chose to continue working they are doing the same job and then get a pay rise when they turn 65			2
proposal : @entity8 mp @entity9 claims up to £ 2billion could be raised by changing the rules so pensioners pay @entity2 ' one of the things i have found from talking to employers is that they are not so keen to take on young people and this would make it more attractive			1
' when they take on somebody with 20 years of experience they are already really productive			0
' i think in this challenging climate they are more likely to go for somebody with experience rather than somebody who is fresh			0
' last month , a report by the respected @entity62 found pensioners have enjoyed the fasting - rising incomes over the past decade			0
at the same time , it said , they will shoulder less of the burden of the coalition government 's tax and benefit changes than working age people			0
it found while pensioners ' incomes have risen by 29.4 per cent since 1999 , those of non-pensioners ' have risen by just 26 per cent			0
ms @entity9 made the suggestion as part of a paper called @entity78 , which has put forward seven proposals the government could adopt to help businesses grow			2
other ideas include building a third and fourth runway at @entity84 , a suggestion from @entity8 mp @entity86			0
both mr @entity86 and ms @entity9 are members of the @entity88 , which has published the report			2
it is made up of 39 @entity91 , mainly from the 2010 parliamentary intake , who are particularly interested in the government 's efforts to stimulate economic growth .			0
