@entity6 fractured the skull of her only child @entity8 in ‘ an eruption of frustration ’ before climbing into bed and falling asleep			1

@entity12 fractured the skull of her six week - old daughter in ' an eruption of frustration ' before falling asleep exhausted @entity25 @entity24 heard @entity6 ( pictured ) , 21 , from @entity25 , killed her baby daughter after shunning medication because she wanted to avoid the ' stigma ' of the condition the court heard that her mind was ‘ disturbed ’ at the time of her daughter ’s death , which might have been avoided if she had taken the pills			1
she wept as she appeared in the dock at @entity37 , where she pleaded guilty to a charge of infanticide			2
@entity12 and her boyfriend @entity40 had been living in a house in @entity25 with their daughter , who was born last year on august 28			1
only a few weeks after the birth , on october 7 , mr @entity40 left to start a night shift working as a security guard , leaving his partner at home with @entity8			1
at 10.30pm she sent him a text message which said she was planning to get some rest as the baby was asleep			2
but when he got home at 8am the following morning , mr @entity40 found his daughter lying unconscious and cold in her cot			2
he desperately tried to revive her and called an ambulance but @entity8 was pronounced dead the following day			1
@entity12 initially told hospital staff that she had tripped and dropped the baby			1
however an x-ray revealed a bilateral fracture of her skull which was ‘ non-accidental ’			2
prosecutor @entity59 said only ‘ significant ’ force would have produced bilateral fractures			2
he added : ‘ the severity of the injuries were inconsistent with the accident fall from waist height to a carpeted bedroom floor			0
’ @entity67 , defending , explained that @entity12 had been diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth			1
he said : ‘ the drugs that could have saved this from happening were not taken			0
it ’s just a matter of circumstance and regret that those tablets were n’t taken			0
’ @entity12 , who was originally charged with murder , has been using a public @entity78 page to pay tribute to her daughter			1
alongside one picture of @entity8 she has written : ‘ our gorgeous little princess rip darling			1
it was the best time of our lives			0
’ a death notice posted in their local newspaper described the baby girl as the ‘ special daughter of @entity6 and @entity40 ’			2
it said : ‘ you kicked your socks and scratch mittens off			0
you always peeped to see if one of us were holding you			0
@entity25 @entity24 heard @entity12 admitted the rare charge of infanticide on the grounds that she suffered a ' temporary unbalance ' of her mind ‘ you are our first baby , a beautiful daughter born			1
‘ all that we have left are photos and memories of your hiccups and , most of all , memories of you			0
love and miss you so much baby girl			0
’ judge @entity110 explained that the crime of infanticide , which is ‘ very rare ’ , carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment			0
but the court heard that ‘ virtually all ’ past sentences have been non-custodial			0
he said : ‘ the facts are clear			0
you killed your child , your wanted and loved baby , while the balance of your mind was disturbed			0
’ however he said he would need to take some time to consider the case before delivering a sentence			0
‘ this is both an anxious and difficult case and a little time for reflection is needed by me in order that i deal justly , ’ he said .			0
