sixty three seconds was all it took			0
just over one minute was enough for a game to be turned on its head and for refereeing standards to be demonstrated , once again , to be lamentable			0
to deal with the first part of that conundrum , referee @entity4 ca n’t really be blamed for the game ending as a spectacle before it had even got going			2
@entity9 and @entity10 got themselves in a terrible tangle , the former with a sloppy pass and the latter clumsily challenging @entity15 , who was through on goal			1
the red card was justifiable and the challenge was a bone - headedly stupid one to make in the first minute			1
the real drama occurred thereafter , however			0
@entity15 , to his credit , attempted to go on and score			2
@entity9 , attempting to redeem his error , ran round to challenge the @entity25 and make a good challenge to block him			1
referee @entity4 shows a red card to @entity9 ( right ) during the second minute of @entity29 's match at @entity30			1
but it was @entity10 who committed the original foul on @entity15 as the striker tried to break through on goal @entity29 defender @entity10 makes the original challenge on @entity30 striker @entity15 just outside the penalty area the @entity25 striker heads to the ground under @entity10 's clumsy challenge but managed to regain his balance and continue @entity41 continues but @entity9 then comes in with a challenge of his own from the opposite angle inside the area @entity15 goes to ground again under @entity9 's challenge , leading to the dismissal of the @entity29 player @entity15 heads to the @entity51 turf after being challenged by @entity9 as the ball runs clear @entity4 brandishes a straight red card to a bemused @entity9 after just 89 seconds of the match @entity29 players @entity56 and @entity58 protest as @entity4 shows @entity9 the red card @entity60 showed the incident from referee @entity4 's perspective , with no 25 @entity10 the closest to him @entity29 boss @entity63 does n't look at @entity9 as he makes his way back to the dressing rooms at the @entity51 as this sign at the @entity51 confirms , @entity9 's sending off was the fastest in the @entity67 this season at 89 seconds @entity29 players ( from left ) @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity56 argue with @entity4 at half - time @entity30 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity73 6 ; @entity74 6.5 , @entity75 6 , @entity76 6.5 , @entity77 7 ; @entity78 7 , @entity79 7 , @entity80 6 ( @entity81 65 ; 6.5 ) , @entity82 8.5 ( @entity83 81 ; 6 ) , @entity41 8 ( @entity84 78 ; 6 ) , @entity85 7 substitutes not used : @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 scorers : @entity41 ; @entity79 40 ; @entity82 77 manager : @entity92 6 @entity29 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity93 8 ; @entity10 3 , @entity9 4 , @entity94 6.5 , @entity58 4.5 ; @entity95 6 ; @entity96 6.5 ( @entity97 89 ) , @entity56 7 , @entity70 5 , @entity71 6 ; @entity98 5 ( @entity99 86 ) substitutes not used : wisdom , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity97 , @entity102 , rose red card : @entity9 manager : @entity63 5 referee : @entity4 ( @entity107 ) 3 player ratings by @entity108 at the @entity51 @entity15 's opening goal at the @entity51			1
click here for our match zone service in the midst of all that , @entity4 blew up for a foul from where @entity10 had made the initial challenge			1
but instead of sending off the left back he dismissed @entity9			2
in one year the @entity67 has now seen three cases of the wrong man being sent off			2
either referees are getting worse , or the game is getting immeasurably faster			0
and with rugby ’s @entity124 tournament reaching a climax yesterday , you longed for a brief pause in which the referee could consult a fourth official who could adjudicate on the red card – he would have probably concurred – and then ensure the right man is sent off			1
@entity63 naturally agreed with that , arguing managers should have the ability to challenge two decisions in a match , citing the fact that in other games @entity10 ’s challenge might have gone unpunished			1
‘ the inconsistency is one thing , ’ he said			0
‘ but once he decides it ’s a goal - scoring opportunity and he has to send him of i ca n’t believe he ’s picked the wrong player			2
@entity92 ’s assessment was about correct			0
‘ he made a mistake about the player but i think the rule is very clear , ’ he said			2
‘ the chance was very clear and he was the last man			2
then it does n’t depend on the referee – he has to do what the rule says			0
’ naturally the match felt unnaturally uncompetitive thereafter and that seemed to be reflected in the crowd			0
the atmosphere at @entity30 after a week of defeats to @entity161 and @entity162 was as muted as could be			2
technically they are still in the title race ; in fact they are only three points behind , albeit @entity168 have two games in hand			1
but judging from the mood at the @entity51 yesterday , that is merely a theoretical , abstract concept			0
all belief seems to have been sucked out of the club , meaning that all that is left is a top - four finish to oversee before @entity92 is thanked for his time and his two trophies			1
@entity15 celebrates after scoring @entity30 's first goal after 25 minutes at the @entity51 the @entity25 striker opened his account for the club when he spun inside the box , hooked the ball over and fired into the net @entity79 gets down on his knees to celebrate scoring @entity30 's second goal five minutes before half - time the @entity191 pounced from close range following @entity29 defensive confusion , with goalkeeper @entity93 grounded @entity82 ( centre ) is congratulated after scoring @entity30 's third goal to make absolutely sure of the three points @entity82 raises his arms in celebration after touching in a shot by @entity200 from the edge of the penalty box there was a brief spell in which you wondered if @entity92 ’s woes might get worse should they fail to break down ten - man @entity29			1
but the visitors , @entity93 aside , were n’t in the mood for gritty defiance			0
indeed , it seemed as though the entire fiasco had collectively scrambled their defensive brains			0
the first two goals they conceded , which made their task hopeless both came from corners , situations at which they should be able to defend more easily than from open play			0
but for the first goal on 26 minutes , @entity30 worked the ball well from a short corner to @entity15			1
@entity70 attempted a half hearted challenge but @entity15 was not to be shrugged off the ball and pulled it down ; the unfortunate @entity10 was also culpable , not reacting quick enough as the @entity25 controlled , shot and scored his first goal for the club since his £ 28m move			1
@entity29 might have felt a little more aggrieved for the second goal on 40 minutes – though it too involved some dreadful defending			1
@entity78 corner was met by the high , flying foot of @entity233 and it seemed perilously close to @entity96 ’s head			0
that said , from thereon in , @entity29 hardly covered themselves in glory			0
@entity58 sliced the ball gently into the path of @entity79 and @entity71 failed to react as the @entity191 simply poked the ball into the net			2
@entity73 collides with @entity29 defender @entity58 as he comes out to try and punch the ball clear @entity94 leaps in behind @entity74 but sends the ball over @entity73 's goal following a rare @entity29 attack @entity98 somehow hit the crossbar with this header , with @entity73 nowhere near it ‘ i think our fans believe we can do it , ’ said @entity92			1
‘ the important thing is to demonstrate playing the way we did today that we will try			0
’ that they did , with 46 shots on goal			0
but it ’s not enough to sustain credibility at present			0
there was a brief spell in which you wondered if @entity92 ’s woes might get worse should they fail to break down ten - man @entity29			1
but the visitors , goalkeeper @entity93 aside , were n’t in the mood for gritty defiance			0
indeed , it seemed as though the entire fiasco had collectively scrambled their defensive brains			0
for the first goal on 26 minutes , @entity30 worked the ball well from a short corner to @entity15			1
@entity70 attempted a half - hearted challenge but @entity15 was not to be shrugged off the ball and pulled it down ; and the unfortunate @entity10 was also culpable , not reacting quick enough as the @entity25 controlled , shot and scored his first goal for the club since his £ 28m move			1
the @entity281 under 21 striker ca n't quite believe his luck after seeing his header rebound off the woodwork @entity80 rues a missed opportunity as @entity30 attempted to boost their goal difference - settling for three in the end @entity30 striker @entity200 appeals to referee @entity4 for a handball decision were it not for @entity93 the afternoon would have been even more calamitous			1
his most notable saves came from @entity82 on 23 minutes , 54 minutes and 59 minutes but that was by no means an exhaustive list			2
@entity29 were also saved on 58 minutes by the post when @entity85 struck and then again by the woodwork , when @entity15 chipped the rebound on to the cross bar			1
on 73 minutes there was an extraordinary development ; a @entity29 corner , which was flicked on by @entity58 to @entity98 , who , just two yards out , flicked an instinctive header on to the bar			2
the miss summed up a dismal afternoon			0
shortly afterwards , @entity82 , by far the best player on the pitch , confirmed the inevitable			0
@entity200 combined well with the rampaging @entity77 and the @entity308 ’s shot was turned in at close range by @entity82 , who departed shortly after to a standing ovation			1
still , the overwhelming feeling from both sides was of a season gently winding down rather than reaching a dramatic climax			0
@entity29 's @entity95 and @entity30 's @entity85 compete for the bouncing ball @entity29 captain @entity56 manages to win the ball from @entity30 striker @entity15 the managers @entity63 and @entity92 greet one another ahead of kick - off at the @entity51			1

@entity4 showed a red card to @entity9 after just 89 seconds of the match at the @entity51
but last man @entity10 should have been sent off for the original foul as @entity15 broke through
@entity9 had made a secondary challenge on @entity41 as he entered the penalty area
up against 10 men for 88 minutes , @entity30 won easily thanks to @entity41 , @entity79 and @entity82
@entity25 striker @entity15 scored his first goal for the club with a neat spin and finish on 25 minutes
@entity79 *doubled* the *advantage* five minutes before the break after @entity29 failed to clear a corner
@entity82 made sure in the second - half , touching in a @entity200 shot from close range
city are now three points behind @entity168 at the top of the @entity67 though have played two games more
