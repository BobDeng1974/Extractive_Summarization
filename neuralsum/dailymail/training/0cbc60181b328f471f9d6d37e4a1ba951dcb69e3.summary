there have been times when @entity2 has made an instant impression			1
@entity4 knew it when he first saw him play aged seven			2
‘ it was the football brain , ’ said @entity4 , the former @entity6 midfielder who whisked @entity2 straight off to @entity7			1
@entity9 was quickly on to it , too			1
but there have been times when @entity2 must have felt invisible , as injuries and ill - conceived loan spells delayed his breakthrough			1
he came close to turning his back on the club he loves , but then @entity9 arrived and , after 16 years at @entity6 , he is finally an overnight sensation			1
@entity2 ( left ) tussles with @entity19 during @entity6 's clash with @entity21 in december @entity2 ( left ) and @entity22 give out @entity24 presents at the @entity25 in @entity26 @entity2 celebrates his goal against @entity28 in the @entity29 in september @entity6 ( 2008 - ) : 17 games , 1 goal @entity32 ( loan , 2009 - 10 ) : 29 games , 6 goals @entity36 ( loan , 2010 - 11 ) : 20 games , 1 goal @entity39 ( loan , 2011 - 12 ) : 6 games , 0 goals @entity43 ( loan , 2013 ) : 0 games @entity46 ( loan , 2013 - 14 ) : 22 games , 5 goals total : 91 games , 13 goals ‘ it ’s something i ’ve been waiting for , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ if this manager had been in charge two or three years ago , i would probably have 50 or 60 @entity56 games under my belt by now			2
i ’m in the team now and i ca n’t complain			2
it ’s a great feeling			2
i ’ve always believed i could play for this club			2
’ there were times when he had to fight the urge to leave			2
it was tempting when @entity65 wanted him at @entity66 and @entity67 tried to lure him to @entity36 , but he believed in his own ability			1
‘ it ’s difficult to take when you do n’t get the chance , ’ said @entity2			1
he speaks quietly but clearly and his words have meaning			2
he is not afraid of expressing his opinion			2
‘ there were times when i just wanted to leave and have a fresh start			2
i was n’t getting the opportunities i thought i deserved			2
‘ i thought maybe going to a new club would change all that and that if i moved permanently instead of going on loan , i ’d get treated differently			1
there were a few clubs in the @entity83 and i spoke to some managers , but i wanted to play for @entity6			1
there was always that doubt that if i left i ’d end up regretting it , and i would have definitely regretted it			2
’ during a frustrating spell at @entity6 , @entity2 was tempted to take up an offer from @entity65 at @entity66 his story is a triumph for patience and faith , which are the attributes prompting some to tip him as a future @entity6 captain			1
‘ he ’s shown character and resilience , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ there are not many opportunities in modern football — not like in my day — but i ’m surprised he ’s taken so long and it ’s not easy to be patient			2
he clearly had the ability			2
from the age of six or seven , he stood out			0
he always knew what to do and where to do it			0
he had a natural understanding , and football intelligence separates the good from the great			0
‘ if you have a good football brain you can reach the very highest level , because the brain tells the feet what to do			0
he has good feet , good skill , he ’s a good passer			0
you can still see he rarely gets caught			0
’ @entity2 had just turned seven when he attended one of @entity4 ’s soccer schools in @entity118 and , before he knew it , he was training at @entity6 , pocketing free tickets and marvelling at @entity121 from the stands			1
@entity2 's career at @entity6 has transformed since the arrival of @entity9 ( right ) at the club he was a no 10 like @entity121 until he went on loan to @entity32 where manager @entity128 moved him deeper into the role he now plays			1
‘ i was a luxury player , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ having been pampered at @entity6 for so long , i went into @entity131 and had to graft and learn the ugly side of the game			1
i grew as a player			0
’ he was just 17 when @entity135 gave him his @entity6 debut as a late substitute in a @entity139 tie , at the start of a season when he would score 58 goals for the youth team			1
but it was nearly six years before @entity2 started his first @entity56 game , a north @entity147 derby at @entity148			1
between the dates there were loans at @entity32 , @entity39 , @entity36 and @entity46 and a disastrous five months at @entity152 club @entity43			1
he did not make a single appearance			0
‘ that was a bad experience , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ i was pretty close to the @entity6 first team and i ’d been on the bench quite a bit , made my first start in the @entity29 and then got a knee injury			1
‘ it was nothing major but i was out for a couple weeks and i fell down the pecking order			0
it probably was n’t a good idea to pick @entity43 but i thought playing in the top league in @entity152 would be better than playing in the @entity83 again			1
it just did n’t work out			0
i could n’t wait to get home			0
i was there on my own from january until the end of the season			0
@entity2 has been at @entity6 since he was age seven and marveled at @entity121 from the stands ‘ i picked up a bit of @entity152 — that was the best part about it			1
i spent that season hardly kicking a ball			0
’ others might have stormed home , but @entity2 was determined to see it out			1
a loan to @entity46 eased the pain , but niggling injuries went on and his efforts to beef up did n’t help			1
‘ between 18 and 21 , a lot of people said i needed to put on weight , ’ he said			0
‘ in @entity187 there ’s a philosophy that it ’s better to be bigger and stronger			0
i was in the gym doing bench - presses which had no relevance and it was n’t helping me on the pitch			1
it was extra weight i did n’t need and i could n’t carry			0
a lot of injuries came through that			0
now i ’m in a better place			0
i ’m just under 6ft , i ’m wiry and probably the lightest i ’ve been , but the strongest			0
’ @entity9 ’s arrival last summer from @entity200 changed everything			1
@entity2 , now a box - to - box midfielder , has started the past 11 league games , keeping out expensive signings such as @entity205 and @entity206			1
@entity2 's good from has kept the likes of @entity205 ( left ) and @entity206 out of the first team it has been a spluttering @entity6 season but there are signs of progress , climbing the @entity56 and in a @entity29 quarter - final against @entity215 for which @entity9 , mindful of the heavy holiday fixture list ahead , may well shuffle his pack @entity2 said : ‘ this club needs to win trophies			1
it ’s important to aim for the @entity221 as well			0
though we ’ve had a pretty poor start we ’re close to fourth and if we can get consistency it can happen			0
’ mature and confident , he has embraced responsibilities on and off the pitch			0
last week , he joined team - mates to deliver @entity24 gifts to children in @entity26 ’s @entity25			2
‘ two or three weeks into pre- season , i realised it might be different , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ maybe it came down to a bit of trust			0
the gaffer recognised i had a good pre-season and was training well			0
he said i ’d play for him in the @entity56 this season			0
to hear that was great			0
@entity2 was just 17 when @entity135 ( above ) gave him his @entity6 debut as a substitute in a @entity139 tie ‘ he ’s a strong believer in giving 100 per cent in training			1
if you ’re training well , you ’ll play and i was one of the better players in training			0
' he ’s showed a lot of faith in me			0
i ’m 23 and i feel like i deserve to be playing			0
it ’s not like i ’m a kid being thrown in			0
at the same time , not many managers would put an inexperienced player into the @entity56			0
‘ it ’s such a big league , not many young , @entity187 , homegrown players get a fair crack of the whip , but this gaffer brought young players through at @entity200			2
hopefully i can continue to pay him back			0
i do n’t want to be one of these players who have a good little spell			0
