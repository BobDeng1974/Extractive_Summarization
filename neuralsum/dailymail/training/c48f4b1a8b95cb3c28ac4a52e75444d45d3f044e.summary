by @entity0 a @entity2 firm has revealed ambitious plans to send a spacecraft to @entity5 to bring back dust from the atmosphere in 2018			1
the @entity8 - a new , privately funded , not - for - profit organization , is hoping to attract a billion dollars from donors to fund the mission - beating @entity10 to the red planet in the process			0
it also plans to launch a space telescope to hunt for alien life			0
once in the @entity5 atmosphere , ' ears ' will appear , giving the craft solar power			1
one contains the gel it will use to capture particles from 40km above the surface			1
the mission could launch in 2018 , and will involve a daring high - speed atmospheric pass down to below 40 km altitude			2
the mission is timed to coincide with seasonal @entity5 dust storms , collecting thousands of precious @entity5 dust particles from the atmosphere			1
particles will be collected in a gel , similar to the one recently used to capture particles from a comet			2
after the sample collection pass at @entity5 , the spacecraft returns directly to @entity39 , where its precious , sterilized samples descend by parachute to the ground			1
the first of the missions @entity45 intends to pursue is @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , a @entity5 flyby mission that would dive deep into the martian atmosphere			1
the spacecraft would collect atmospheric dust during that flyby and return it to @entity39 after skimming just 40km form the surface of the red planet during a dust storm			1
the @entity46 mission concept dates back more than a decade to when it was a finalist for @entity10 â€™s first @entity57 , a competition won by the @entity59			2
the mission could launch in 2018 , and will involve a daring high - speed atmospheric pass down to below 40 km altitude			0
the mission is timed to coincide with seasonal @entity5 dust storms , collecting thousands of precious @entity5 dust particles from the atmosphere			1
after the sample collection pass at @entity5 , the spacecraft returns directly to @entity39 , where its precious , sterilized samples descend by parachute to the ground			1
@entity70 , the principal investigator for the original @entity46 proposal , said at a recent meeting that the organization was working with industry partner @entity74 to update the mission concept			0
' the @entity78 to investigate @entity5 will return the first samples of @entity5 materials to @entity39 without the complexity and risk of landing , and at a fraction of the cost , ' the firm said			2
' as the first round trip mission to @entity5 , @entity46 will break new ground , and set the stage for future visits to @entity5 by humans			2
' @entity46 will fundamentally advance our knowledge of the geology , climate and habitability of @entity5 , a terrestrial planet that may have been similar to @entity39 in its early history			2
' as the first sample return from another terrestrial planet , @entity46 will provide a unique data set and a comparative basis for understanding how the rocky inner planets formed and why they have evolved so differently from each other			0
' the craft will make its way back to @entity39 with the sterilised samples on board it will use a parachute to touch down - and samples from the @entity5 atmosphere will then be distributed to labs around the world the second project is a novel space telescope for the @entity117 era called @entity118			1
dr. @entity119 , chief executive officer of @entity8 , said : ' the future of space science is at a critical juncture in the @entity123 and around the globe			0
' we know how important and exciting this kind of research is , but the unfortunate reality is that government funding for space science is falling , even while public interest in space remains high			0
' @entity8 will play a leading role in advancing this @entity135 movement , aimed at nothing less than incredible discoveries			0
' the organisation cited cuts in @entity10 funding for its existence			0
' this is a challenging yet exciting time in the planetary and space sciences , with limited government funding for space missions but also some new opportunities through private and commercial avenues , ' said dr @entity149 , director of the @entity150 at @entity151 and a @entity8 board member			0
' the current model leaves a tremendous amount of frontier science on the cutting room @entity157 are compelled to explore new ways to advance our scientific goals , and i believe that the model we have created with @entity8 will do just that			0

@entity165 will pass 40km above the @entity5 surface
will collect dust during a @entity5 storm in gel disc
disc will parachute back to earth for *analysis*
