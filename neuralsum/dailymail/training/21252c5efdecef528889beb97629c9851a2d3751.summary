@entity0 looks and sounds like a man living the dream			1
he bounds in for this interview and shoots a beaming smile , still buzzing from a surreal couple of days in which he went from lower - league cult hero to a globally - trending superstar			1
the shirt given to him by @entity12 captain @entity11 after @entity15 ’s courageous @entity14 third round efforts on monday night has n't left his side since			1
he keeps glancing towards it , smiling			2
you sense he ’ll never tire of telling that story			2
@entity0 has enjoyed quite a week after heroics for @entity15 against @entity12 on monday @entity0 picked up the perfect souvenir - a signed shirt from his @entity12 idol @entity11 @entity0 ( second right ) celebrates after scoring against @entity12 in monday night 's @entity14 tie the striker reacted quickest to bring @entity15 level at 1 - 1 but @entity12 went on to win the tie 2 - 1 @entity0 is marked by @entity12 's @entity29 at a corner during monday 's game at @entity32 it is a predictably firm handshake			1
you do n’t earn a nickname like ‘ @entity36 ’ for being a scrawny shrinking violet			1
@entity0 is certainly a big guy and a big personality and he plays perfectly to the fan ’s love of anyone who for whatever reason does n't conform to the stereotype of what a footballer should look like			1
here are the numbers of ‘ @entity36 ’ : he is 32 years of age , stands at 5ft 11in and weighs in at about 16st			1
he can bench press 180kg - or two - and - a - half @entity48			1
he has played for 12 clubs in a career often described as ‘ journeyman ’ and plundered 160 goals			1
the 160th of those came in the 36th minute at @entity32 on monday when , despite his perceived slowness , he was quickest to react when goalkeeper @entity57 flapped at a corner and drew the @entity60 side level at 1 - 1			1
@entity62 's @entity61 challenges ' @entity36 ' to an arm - wrestling contest the contest produced a predictable result as ' football 's strongest man ' @entity0 effortlessly claimed victory were it not for @entity11 ’s two inspired interventions , @entity12 could easily have fallen victim to the greatest @entity14 shock of modern times			1
still ‘ @entity36 ’ , having threatened to punch any team - mate who objected , gained the perfect souvenir from his idol			1
‘ yeah , he signed it for me , ’ he said , glancing again at the crumple of red on the table			2
‘ i ’m grateful and i ’m happy			0
it ’s getting framed by the end of this week			0
i ’m going to put it with the shirt i wore and have a little souvenir of a momentous day			2
’ whether they ’d previously seen @entity0 terrorising @entity60 defences or seen him play for the first time on @entity89 on monday , fans have wanted to know what makes up his diet and gym routine			1
@entity0 celebrates after @entity15 beat rivals @entity93 in the @entity94 @entity0 in action for @entity97 during the @entity60 play - off final in 2013 @entity98 is one of the 12 clubs ' journeyman ' @entity0 has played for in his career lifting the @entity94 alongside @entity103 after @entity98 's victory in 2006 here ’s a typical day on the ‘ @entity105 ’ : ‘ breakfast is @entity107 with honey			1
at training there will be some kind of chicken			0
our chef personally does chicken for me and that makes me very happy			0
‘ then a shake in the afternoon			0
for dinner , again it ’s probably chicken , potato and coleslaw			0
my partner is half - @entity123 , half - @entity124 so it may be the curry goat , rice and potato			2
it ’s the carbs i need to eat			0
‘ i throw in the odd @entity128			0
quarter - chicken , medium breast , chips , corn on the cob and five wings			2
’ then something of a surprise : ‘ medium spice though , i ca n’t take hot			0
i know people keep thinking i do but i ’m not a spicy kind of man			0
’ he then adds : ‘ my fitness guy does n’t think i eat enough			0
he always tries to get me to eat more			0
such feasts certainly explain @entity0 ’s size but what about the power and strength that makes him so difficult to defend against			1
that is explained by daily visits to the gym - the ‘ @entity151 work - out			1
’ the 32 - year - old in action for @entity15 during their high - profile @entity14 tie with @entity12 @entity0 was quickest to react to fire home @entity15 's equalising goal against the @entity157 @entity159 - @entity158 ( @entity160 and @entity161 ) @entity163 - @entity162 ( @entity160 and @entity161 ) @entity165 - @entity164 ( @entity166 and @entity167 ) @entity168 ( @entity169 and @entity170 ) @entity165 - @entity171 ( @entity172 and @entity167 ) @entity174 - @entity173 ( @entity172 and @entity167 ) @entity174 - @entity175 ( @entity176 and @entity177 ) @entity174 - @entity178 ( @entity179 and @entity170 ) @entity181 - @entity180 ( @entity172 and @entity182 ) @entity184 - @entity183 ( @entity166 and @entity185 ) @entity187 - @entity186 ( @entity169 and @entity182 ) ‘ i ca n’t forget the notion i ’m a footballer , so i ca n’t just keep pumping and pumping because i ’ve still got to run around , ’ he said			1
‘ gym sessions will always consist of 40 minutes to one - hour cardio			1
i try to stay off the treadmill because of the pounding , so it ’s the rower or the cross-trainer			0
‘ then i go on to the stuff i really enjoy - the weights			2
depending on the day , it ’ll be the shoulders or arms or back			0
‘ i ’ve done the 180kg [ bench press ] when i go to the gym with my younger brother - he ’s my trainer and he pushes me			1
the big weights come into play			0
but i do maybe 120kg every day			0
i know what i need to do			0
’ and that regimen - day - after - day , season - after - season - has built ‘ @entity36 ’			1
@entity0 already has a clothing line called ‘ @entity209 ’ and i suggest his next business venture could be a ‘ @entity36 ’ cookery show on saturday morning tv and a ‘ @entity216 ’ dvd out in time for @entity215			1
‘ that ’s quite a good plan , ’ he smiles			0
@entity0 has issued an appeal to former @entity93 star @entity220 , seen here in 1998 film @entity223 , for a part in his next movie the point is , @entity0 is unique			1
few lower - league players have their own fashion label , few go viral on @entity229 and few are considered such an authority that they sit around a table with @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 to pick their @entity236			2
but then , as the player with the highest strength rating on the wildly popular video game , nobody is going to argue with him			0
and the next target in the @entity36 ’s quest for world domination could be @entity244 , using his @entity93 connections to land a part in @entity220 ' next movie			1
‘ he has n’t even hit me up			0
hey @entity220 ! @entity249 , if you ’re reading this … let ’s do a movie together , ’ he said			0
‘ i want to do something different to the stereotype - me being a security guard or a bouncer or a hitman			2
i ’m thinking something like the love interest - i take @entity220 ’s girl or something			2
‘ in the end , we do a sing - song			2
they would n’t see that coming			0
’ it could well be a blockbuster			0
the @entity270 @entity269 is available from january 12th			0
