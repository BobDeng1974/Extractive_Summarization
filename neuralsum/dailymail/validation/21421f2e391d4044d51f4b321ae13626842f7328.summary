@entity0 would welcome @entity1 back into the @entity3 dug - out were he to make a surprise return from gardening leave			1
the question of who leads the squad for the remainder of a flagging promotion campaign is high on the agenda for @entity12 and the new @entity14 directors			2
@entity0 became caretaker manager when @entity1 left under the previous regime before @entity17 , but began working his own notice period in january			1
@entity0 and @entity1 ( right ) worked together before the latter left @entity3 on gardening leave interim chairman @entity20 has stated that new board — which has already been approached by number of managerial candidates as they weigh up a longer - term appointment — will have to speak to both men to ‘ ask what they want to do ’ given that they remain employees			1
a financial agreement over @entity1 ’s remaining contract may well be the more likely outcome , but @entity0 would be happy to see his old colleague back for the @entity34 run - in were that to transpire			1
‘ i was working with @entity35 , so obviously that would appeal to me , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but it ’s a difficult one to answer because the board will obviously have their own ideas			2
’ @entity0 said it was n't for him to decide but that he would welcome @entity40 back to the club too another former @entity14 boss , @entity40 , refused at the weekend to completely rule out what would be a third stint in charge , but stressed that he was n’t looking for it ‘ in any way , shape or form			1
’ @entity0 was first - team coach during @entity40 ’s hugely successful second spell and admitted his presence would provide a guaranteed boost			1
‘ it ’s not for me to decide , ’ said @entity0 , who is keen for coach @entity53 to return to first - team duties after being demoted by the old board			1
‘ it ’s for @entity40 to discuss with the board , if that ’s the case			2
‘ but @entity40 going anywhere would absolutely give the place a lift			0
he is a great man and has done so much in the game			0
why would you not , at the end of the day ? but , as i say , it ’s not my call			0
@entity1 left the @entity14 club before @entity17 on gardening leave and @entity69 later did the same ‘ we had a very successful time when he was here but times are different			1
it ’s been a tough , tough time we ’ve had since he left			0
‘ @entity35 did a fantastic job without getting a whole lot of credit			0
but that will come eventually			0
’ the new directors are likely to speak with @entity0 about his own future once tonight ’s game against @entity84 is out of the way			1
they met yesterday with former @entity87 boss @entity86 , who is a @entity3 shareholder and has ideas on how the footballing department could move forward			1
but he is not thought to be an immediate candidate to replace @entity0			1
@entity86 is not thought to be an immediate candidate to replace @entity0 despite a meeting with the club ‘ every day , there is someone else being quoted — @entity40 , @entity86 , @entity96 , @entity69 , @entity97 , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ all of those guys are out there and it ’s the board ’s right to talk to whoever they want			2
it does n’t really affect me , because talk about replacing me has been there since i took the job as caretaker manager			0
‘ i ’m here and ready to meet the new board whenever they want to meet me			2
i ’m working my notice			0
if they want to keep me , they can keep me			0
if they want me to go then i ’ll go			0
‘ there is nothing tricky about it			0
i ’m here and i ’m doing my best to try and get the team through a difficult period			0
