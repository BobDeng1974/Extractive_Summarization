education secretary @entity0 said children needed longer school days and shorter holidays to keep pace with other countries the traditional long summer school holiday is a relic of the 19th century and must be consigned to history , @entity0 declared yesterday			1
the @entity0 said it was wrong that terms were still scheduled for a time when children were needed to help out on farms and most mothers stayed at home			1
and he warned of more strikes ahead , accusing unions of lacking ambition and putting the needs of teachers before those of children in their care			1
some schools have already overhauled their term patterns , abolishing the long six - week summer break			0
but mr @entity0 wants every school to follow suit , with longer days and shorter holidays			1
he told an education conference : ‘ we ca n’t afford an education system that was essentially set in the nineteenth century			0
’ the government has previously suggested the school day could be extended to last from 7.30am to 5.30pm , boosting learning and making it easier for parents to go to work			1
mr @entity0 said ‘ some of the best schools in the country ’ recognise the need to change the structure of the school term and move to a longer school day			1
new powers for headteachers to pay good teachers more could also be used to increase school hours , he said			1
he also promised to tackle ' one or two legislative or bureaucratic obstacles ' which stop all schools modernising their hours			0
‘ it ’s consistent with the pressures of a modern society			0
i also think it ’s going to be family friendly , ’ mr @entity0 told the event organised by the @entity54 magazine			0
ministers believe the change could herald cheaper holidays if term times are staggered while working parents would benefit from not having to take time off or find childcare for weeks on end			1
should summer holidays for schoolchildren be shortened ? should summer holidays for schoolchildren be shortened ? now share your opinion under the current system , the school year is 190 days long			1
pupils get around six weeks off in summer , two weeks at @entity74 and @entity75 as well as three half - term breaks lasting a week each			0
school days usually run from around 9am to 3pm , or 3.30pm			1
but the @entity78 said a number of academies - which are free from local authority control - are already altering the length of the school day			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ the structure of the school term and the school day was designed at a time when we had an agricultural economy			1
‘ i remember half term in october when i was at school in @entity92 was called the tattie holiday - the period when kids would go to the fields to pick potatoes			1
it was also at a time when the majority of mums stayed home			0
‘ that world no longer exists , and we ca n’t afford to have an education system that was essentially , set in the nineteenth century			2
’ two evacuees , @entity105 and @entity106 from @entity107 in @entity108 learn how to milk the cows by @entity110 on her family farm in @entity112			0
mr @entity0 said long school holidays date back to schoolchildren working in an agriculture economy mr @entity0 's drive to overhaul school hours is backed by @entity118			1
the prime minister 's official spokesman pointed to the need to ' reform a whole series of parts of our education system to reflect the very modern global race that the @entity127 is in '			1
a @entity129 source added : ' we can either start working as hard as the @entity131 , or we 'll all soon be working for the @entity131			2
' in a speech mr @entity0 said that pupils are at a ' significant handicap ' compared to youngsters in @entity137 nations who benefit from extra tuition and support from teachers			0
what is now known as six weeks of sun , fun and holidays were not always so			0
the summer break and other school holidays were during spring planting and early autumn harvests children were needed at home			1
they would help with the work in the fields or in the house during the busiest time of the agricultural calendar			0
other breaks in the school year would often be for financial reasons as schools would shut due to lack funding to pay for coal to heat up the classrooms in wintertime			0
mr @entity0 said : ' one of the striking things about @entity137 is that they do not have what we have in @entity169 , is the automatic assumption that you divide children into the achievers and the others , the academic and the vocational			0
' they believe that every child can be educated			0
the assumption is that all children at every year will absorb and learn the curriculum			0
and their expectations are higher than in this country			0
' school days are longer , school holidays are shorter			1
the expectation is that to succeed , hard work is at the heart of everything			0
' and if you look at the length of the school day in @entity169 , the length of the summer holiday – and we compare it to the extra tuition and support that children are receiving elsewhere - then we are fighting or actually running in this global race in a way that ensures that we start with a significant handicap			2
' however , teaching unions were quick to reject the idea of longer hours being of benefit to pupils			2
earlier this month the @entity204 ( @entity204 ) demanded teachers spend just four hours a day in classrooms , complaining school staff are facing ' totally unsustainable ' workloads			2
some schools have already moved to longer hours and fewer holidays ( file picture ) @entity204 general secretary @entity213 hit out at mr @entity0 's proposal			1
she said : ' teachers and pupils already spend longer hours in the classroom than most countries and also have some of the shortest summer holidays			1
' independent schools in @entity169 and @entity221 , which often break for two weeks more during the summer and have longer holidays at other times of the year than their state counterparts , do not apparently feel the need to change and are apparently not suffering from their reduced hours			2
' yet again we see the education secretary making policy up on the hoof with no real evidence for either the necessity for change or the benefit it brings			1
' mr @entity0 said the school holidays system was set for a time when children were needed to help on farms @entity238 , general secretary of the @entity239 ( @entity239 ) , said : ' some schools are introducing innovative changes to the school day and term and it will be interesting to see what effect these have in the longer term on achievement			1
' but changes should be based on sound , researched evidence , not on anecdotes from other countries with vastly different cultures and attitudes to education			2
' the quality of the learning happening in classrooms when children are in school is more important than the number of hours they spend there			2
' but mr @entity0 also renewed his attack on teaching unions , accusing them of fostering a ‘ culture of low expectations ’ which is holding children back			1
he added : ‘ one of the tragedies of our time is that the teaching unions have chosen to put the interests of adults , ahead of the needs of our children			2
and that is why sadly , the unions , as a voice of teachers is diminishing			2
‘ my challenge not to teachers , but to teaching unions – is to do a better job			2
’ asked if @entity127 was facing more strikes in schools , he replied : ‘ yes			0
there seems to be a competition between the @entity204 and @entity289 to compete for members , with each one trying to out radical the other			0
‘ i think that this is a golden opportunity for teachers to prove what they can achieve			0
’ he urged the unions to set up a @entity296 , offering to find them a building and provide funding .			0
