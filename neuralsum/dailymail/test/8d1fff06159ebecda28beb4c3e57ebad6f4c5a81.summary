carriers of the @entity2 gene , like @entity4 star @entity3 , can reduce their risk of death once they have been diagnosed with breast cancer by having their ovaries removed women diagnosed with breast cancer caused by the gene carried by @entity3 could be helped to beat the disease if they have their ovaries removed as she did			1
a study indicates that following the example of the @entity4 star cuts their risk of dying from breast cancer by more than 60 per cent			1
miss @entity3 , 39 , had the procedure , known as an oophorectomy , in march			0
two years before , she had a double mastectomy as she carries the @entity2 gene variant which dramatically raises the risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer			1
women who carry a mutated version of @entity2 or another gene known as @entity29 face a life - time risk of breast cancer of up to 70 per cent			1
if diagnosed , they face a severe threat of ovarian tumours			0
the researchers in @entity35 analysed 676 breast cancer patients who had one of the mutated genes , nearly half ( 345 ) underwent oophorectomy after their diagnosis			2
the study found the 20 - year survival rate for the entire group was 77.4 per cent			2
having an oophorectomy was associated with a significant drop of 62 per cent in breast cancer death in women with a @entity2 mutation , but this did not occur in those with a @entity29 mutation			1
there were nine deaths from ovarian cancer in the women who did not have oophorectomies			0
the scientists found a 65 per cent reduction in death from all causes associated with oophorectomy			0
according to the study , oophorectomies were performed an average of six years after breast cancer diagnosis			2
for the 70 @entity2 carriers who had their ovaries removed within two years , there was a 73 per cent reduction in death compared with women with the mutation who never underwent the procedure			1
the authors , writing in the journal @entity79 , said that the protective effect of oophorectomy against breast cancer was apparent immediately after diagnosis and lasted for 15 years			1
dr @entity84 , of the @entity85 , @entity86 , called for follow - up studies on women who undergo oophorectomy as part of their initial treatment , in particular , those who had the surgery within a year of finding out they have breast cancer			0
he added that more research was needed , especially on carriers of the @entity29 variant			0
journal editor dr @entity97 said the results were ‘ compelling and suggest the potential of oophorectomy should become part of the treatment discussion at the time of diagnosis for brca mutation carriers with early stage breast cancers ’			0
she added : ‘ the results provide a validation of oophorectomy in coveying both a disease - free and overall survival benefit for @entity2 carriers			0
‘ in the entire group , oophorectomy was particularly effective for survival benefit in women with oestrogen - receptor negative breast cancer			0
’ those women diagnosed with the @entity2 gene mutation have a 50 to 80 per cent risk of developing breast cancer , pictured , in their lifetime women with a significant family history of breast cancer may have an increased risk of getting the disease			1
a significant family history is defined by : women who inherit the faulty , or mutated , @entity2 or @entity29 genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime			1
genetic tests are available to women who are likely to have a @entity2 or @entity29 mutation , or faults in two other genes called @entity134 and @entity135			2
@entity29 gene faults are more common in the @entity138 population , about 2.3 per cent of @entity138 women have a @entity29 gene mutation			1
source : @entity142 this type of the disease affects about one in four women diagnosed with breast cancer			2
it is an especially aggressive form which is often resilient to drug treatment and requires intensive chemotherapy			0
other studies of the gene mutation carriers have found that reduced mortality is associated with ovary removal for women with a history of breast cancer			1
speaking about her decision to have the procedure @entity160 , who has six children , said that having her ovaries removed did not make her feel any less womanly			0
in an article for the @entity166 , she wrote : ‘ i feel feminine , and grounded in the choices i am making for myself and my family			0

carriers of @entity2 gene mutation who are diagnosed with breast cancer are less likely to die if they have their ovaries removed , study found
but the theory does not apply for those with @entity29 gene mutation
having the @entity2 or @entity29 genes increase risk of breast cancer by 70 *%*
*experts* said benefits of having ovaries removed lasted for up to 15 years
