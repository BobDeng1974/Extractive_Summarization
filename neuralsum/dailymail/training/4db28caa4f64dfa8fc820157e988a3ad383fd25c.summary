by @entity0 fourteen months have passed since @entity1 first had the chance to join @entity3			1
it is a period that has provided precious little joy for the winger			0
opting instead to move to @entity8 in a £ 2.2million deal from @entity10 , he struggled to make any impact on @entity13 ’s side amid the rarefied atmosphere of the @entity15			1
@entity1 made a mere six top - flight starts before finding himself surplus to requirements this summer			1
@entity19 would strongly argue , however , that his compatriot is now tailor - made for the current situation at @entity22			1
video : scroll down for boss @entity24 on building a new team at @entity3 new challenge : @entity1 has joined @entity3 after finding his chances at @entity28 limited having urged @entity1 to seize the chance of a year - long loan move at the ground he once graced , @entity19 firmly believes the 24 - year - old will recapture top form in @entity35			1
he looks at the style of play @entity24 wants to implement and sees @entity1 as a perfect fit			1
the @entity40 international , capped 15 times , completed his move on monday night and is expected to go straight into @entity24 ’s squad for the @entity45 qualifier against @entity46 next week			2
‘ the biggest strength @entity49 has is his pace , ’ said @entity19 , who earned hero status at @entity3 between 1999 and 2006			1
‘ honestly , in footballing terms , he is lightning quick			0
‘ he is also equally comfortable on either foot and switches from left to right without any difficulty			0
he can score goals and will provide plenty of assists			0
hero : @entity19 hugs it out with @entity60 during a charity match at @entity22 last year ‘ i believe the new @entity3 manager has had @entity1 on his radar for quite some time and he will be pleased to get him			1
he will fit into the new system very well			0
‘ i ’m positive @entity1 will do well for @entity3			1
he is hungry to do well and desperate to play football and enjoy it once again			0
‘ the last year at @entity8 has been difficult for him but he has the mentality to put that behind him and concentrate on being successful at his new club			2
‘ he called me from @entity35 yesterday to say he already he has a really good feeling about the club and that they have been very professional in their early dealings with him			0
the club has made sure he has been made to feel welcome and has everything he needs			0
’ @entity60 was keen on landing @entity1 last summer and the player may well wish he had taken up that option given his travails in @entity78			2
as it was , @entity60 was pipped at the post by @entity13 and @entity1 took up residence in the @entity82			2
@entity19 still lives in that part of the country after retiring from playing at @entity8 following a gruelling battle against leukaemia			1
he took @entity1 under his wing to try and help him settle in his new surroundings			2
when it became clear the winger ’s future opportunities under @entity13 were going to be limited , @entity19 then delivered a pristine reference to his old employers at @entity22			2
premature end : @entity19 was forced to retire from football following a gruelling battle against leukaemia he has also remained a sounding board for @entity1 and dispelled any doubts the younger man may have had about moving north of the border			1
‘ i told @entity1 to join , ’ said @entity19			1
‘ it was as simple as that			0
‘ he asked me about the history of the club and the supporters and i told him i had seven incredible years at @entity3 and loved life in @entity35 and playing in front of the fantastic supporters inside a packed @entity22			2
but i wanted to leave to test myself in @entity78 and i also had a great time at @entity8			2
‘ he is well aware there huge demands at @entity3 and that he will be expected to help the team win every game			0
he has the mentality to cope with that pressure			0
‘ i ’m sure the @entity3 supporters will enjoy his style of play and they will take them to their hearts very quickly			0
i know he can help the club do well and would love to play in the @entity45 qualifier against @entity46			0
’ there will be @entity3 fans who question the ambition shown the club in making another loan move – following @entity128 ’s arrival from @entity129 – but it could also perhaps be viewed as a reflection on some of their recent transfer dealings			1
there would surely be some within @entity22 happy to have had the option to return the likes of @entity136 or @entity137 to their former clubs after their unconvincing initial efforts			0
and while it ’s true that few tears have been shed in @entity143 over @entity1 ’s exit , he does bring something that was sorely lacking in the 6 - 1 aggregate defeat from @entity147			0
@entity3 looked dismally pedestrian for much of that two - legged tie and an injection of pace is urgently required if @entity24 ’s vision for the team is to be realised			1
the @entity155 manager will stand or fall on landing the right players and making them shine in his system			0
in that respect , he must hope @entity19 ’s glowing appraisal of @entity1 proves accurate .			1

@entity40 joined @entity162 champions on loan following sorry spell at @entity8
@entity3 hero @entity19 has backed his fellow countryman to shine in @entity167
@entity1 *'s* ' lightning pace ' will prove a big hit with fans , says @entity19
