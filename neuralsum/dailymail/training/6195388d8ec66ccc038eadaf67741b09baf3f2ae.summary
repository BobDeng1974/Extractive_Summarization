the wardrobe contains a purple tutu , a silky mauve blouse and a floral patterned skirt			1
the shoes are mostly pastel shades , and a pair of black boots is neatly trimmed in pretty pink			2
there ’s a dolly on the pillow beneath a @entity13 poster and heart - motif wallpaper			2
it could be any little girl ’s bedroom			2
yet the five - year - old who sleeps there is a boy			1
and for more than a year now @entity22 , his long fair hair done up in bunches , has been insisting on living as a member of the opposite sex			1
the extraordinary conclusion that he is a girl trapped inside a boy ’s body is being backed by medical experts and supported by his school , which has made a lavatory block ‘ gender neutral ’ to accommodate his needs			1
' @entity35 , pictured as he dresses now , was last year officially diagnosed with @entity36 at the age of four @entity22 , at the age of four , before he began growing his hair into the pigtails he now prefers cheeky chap : @entity22 beams in a picture taken shortly before his fourth birthday when he was a ' normal little boy ' who liked playing with his @entity44 train set @entity46 @entity45 is one of the youngest known children to be backed by the @entity48 after being diagnosed with @entity36			1
until shortly before his fourth birthday in december 2010 , @entity35 , as his mother @entity49 calls him , was ‘ a normal little boy ’			1
he loved to play with his @entity44 train set alongside his brother @entity52			2
suddenly , however , he became obsessed with the children ’s tv cartoon character @entity55 , and started to dress in girls ’ clothes			2
mrs @entity58 , who has two other children , said : ‘ he just turned round to me one day and said , “ @entity62 , i ’m a girl ”			2
i assumed he was just going through a phase and left it at that			2
but then it got serious and he would become upset if anyone referred to him as a boy			1
he used to cry and try to cut off his willy out of frustration			2
’ mrs @entity58 , 32 , and husband @entity70 , 41 , became increasingly worried by their son ’s behaviour and took him to a doctor , then to a child psychologist			2
at the @entity76 and @entity77 in @entity78 , which specialises in the disorder , he was diagnosed as having @entity36			2
mrs @entity58 said : ‘ they told us that although he had a male body , his brain was telling him he was a girl			2
’ @entity22 ( right ) with his mother @entity49 , father @entity70 and brother @entity52			1
his family have said he has their full support at home in @entity90 , @entity91 , a first - floor flat in a block on a 1980s estate , @entity88 and mrs @entity58 continued to allow @entity22 to dress in girls ’ clothes and play with his sister ’s dolls			1
meanwhile at @entity22 ’s school , @entity100 , they have applied themselves to what mrs @entity58 calls ‘ the bathroom issue ’ and are hoping @entity22 can use the staff toilets when he gets older			1
and the other pupils ? ‘ we explained to the other kids that @entity22 ’s body was that of a boy but in his brain he was a girl			1
we said @entity22 was just happier being a girl than a boy			1
they have n’t batted an eyelid			0
they ’ve accepted @entity22 as @entity22 and there ’s been no problems at the school with bullying			1
the school has been brilliant and really , really supportive			1
’ @entity100 , which has 350 pupils up to age 11 , was given the lowest ‘ inadequate ’ rating in december after an @entity123 inspection			0
teachers allow @entity22 to wear a girl ’s trouser uniform and black boots with pink trim , which his mother says is female but still neutral			1
she admits she misses her little boy , but adds : ‘ he just wants to be like a little girl			1
he ’s very happy with his long hair , pink - and - red bedroom and a wardrobe full of girls ’ clothes			1
@entity22 's birth certificate registers him as male - but he has been officially diagnosed with @entity36 ‘ he likes playing with his sister ’s old toys but he still loves @entity141 and playing with his brother			1
and we still put some neutral clothes in his wardrobe if he ever decides he wants to wear them			0
we leave it up to him to decide what he wants to do – if he changes his mind and wants to be a boy again then he does , but if he does n’t , he does n’t			1
’ she added : ‘ i would love to have my son back , but i want him to be happy			0
if this is the route he wants to take – if this is what makes him happy – then so be it			0
i would rather him have my full support			0
people need to be aware of this condition because it ’s very common but even many family - support workers have never heard of cases in children			0
there are people out there but they do n’t want to talk about it			0
’ on his @entity168 page , @entity166 describes himself as an artist and ‘ dad of four starting my own business drawing pictures from photos ’			0
sketches he has uploaded include a reclining nude woman wearing a necklace with a large , heart - shaped pendant , based on @entity177 in @entity178			0
others include a blonde girl striking a provocative pose in a figure - hugging top , and a faceless female wearing only a @entity185 t - shirt			0
yesterday he and mrs @entity58 were negotiating with a tabloid newspaper to sell @entity22 ’s story for a five - figure sum			1
figures from the @entity76 and @entity191 clinic – the national body for @entity36 – revealed that 165 children have been diagnosed with the condition this year			0
a spokesman said they were unable to comment on individual cases , but only seven children under five were diagnosed last year – making @entity22 one of the youngest			1
‘ @entity200 had 97 referrals in 2009/2010 ; 139 in 2010/2011 and 165 thus far this year			0
‘ the trend in referrals has been up over the years – this may reflect greater awareness			0
@entity22 's mother said he was a ' normal ' boy until shortly before his fourth birthday , when he started behaving like a girl @entity58 says @entity209 has been very supportive over her son 's condition , even turning its toilet block gender - neutral ‘ we see children and young people up to the age of 18 , from across the @entity217 , who are experiencing difficulties in the development of their gender identity			1
‘ this includes children who are unhappy with their biological sex			0
some may be boys who prefer activities and roles associated with the opposite sex , some may also identify as the opposite sex and vice versa for girls			0
in general when younger children are referred it is in relation to cross-gender preferences in play , playmates and activities			0
it is more unusual for children of this age to express cross-gender identification – that is the wish or belief that they belong to the opposite sex			0
‘ the diagnosis of @entity36 is made by the key workers working with the young person			0
we will also assess their general well - being			0
we remain in contact with young people often for many years			0
‘ our aim is not to predict or direct the outcome , but rather to support the young person in their general development as well as develop a trusting collaborative therapeutic relationship in which it is possible to openly explore their feelings about their gender			0

@entity22 , 5 , *refused* to live as a boy when he was just three
he now wears a tutu and puts his hair in pigtails
primary school has *renamed* the toilets ' unisex ' for him
