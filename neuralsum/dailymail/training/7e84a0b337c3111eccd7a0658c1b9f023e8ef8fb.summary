by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:42 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 03:36 est , 14 august 2012 four members of @entity5 ’s @entity4 team were said to have gone missing in @entity6 yesterday as thousands of their fellow @entity8 athletes and officials flew home			1
their disappearance took the number of @entity14 athletes and delegates attending @entity8 who have vanished from their camps or sought political asylum in @entity18 to 15			2
immigration officials expect that number to increase sharply when athletes ’ special @entity8 visas expire in november			1
not going home : @entity25 's @entity24 , left , @entity26 , centre , and @entity28 , right still in @entity18 : @entity25 's @entity29 , left , @entity30 , centre and @entity32 , right details of the apparent @entity5 defections came as it emerged that at least five members of the @entity25 team have pleaded to be allowed to stay in @entity18 rather than returning with teammates yesterday			1
the @entity39 refused to say whether the five , all boxers , were seeking asylum			2
two members of the @entity44 team and one @entity45 are reported to have sought asylum in the @entity18 , one @entity44 is missing , and two other members of the @entity25 team – a swimmer and a female footballer – have also disappeared after suddenly vanishing from the @entity50			1
a un-run radio station in @entity5 said @entity52 , who competed for the @entity14 country in judo , disappeared after the closing ceremony and has not been reachable on his mobile phone			2
he lost his match after 49 seconds and is said to have left the @entity50 without saying where he was going			0
he had been due to fly home last night			0
plea to stay : flyweight boxer @entity61 , who was beaten by @entity63 's @entity62 , is one of the absconded boxers @entity5 judo coach @entity66 , boxing trainer @entity67 , and national technical director of athletics @entity70 had also gone missing , it was claimed			0
they too were said to have left the @entity50 with their luggage			0
the @entity39 declined to comment on the individual cases			0
@entity5 team officials were ‘ out of contact ’ returning home while no one was available for comment at the country ’s @entity6 embassy			1
the disappearances come at a hugely sensitive time for the government after the success of the @entity4 and with the @entity86 due to begin in two weeks			0
it follows fears from immigration staff that up to 2 per cent of @entity4 visitors from some continents may claim refuge in the @entity18 in the months after the @entity93			0
authorities in @entity25 , which is regarded as one of the more stable countries in @entity97 , have accused the boxers of wanting to be economic migrants and say they should have returned home with other athletes			1
but the @entity102 , who absconded from their @entity104 , @entity6 , village last week , told the @entity105 they had been threatened and wanted a sponsor to help them stay in @entity18			0
boxer @entity61 said that there was no support for athletes in @entity25 , adding : ‘ we are not staying here because we do n’t like our country , but [ because we ] want to practise the sports we love			1
we want to become professional			0
we can not return to @entity25 ... if we return , we will not practise any more			1
’ as well as claiming they were threatened , the boxers said promised bonuses had been halved			1
however , @entity115 , the head of the @entity25 delegation to the @entity4 , accused the boxers of lying and said they were making up the allegation to justify desertion			2
the seven - who are members of @entity25 's @entity4 team pictured during the opening ceremony - claim they want to stay in @entity18 to practise the sport that they love and not for economic reasons investigators have identified several countries where they ‘ expect ’ asylum claims from athletes and supporters given visas specifically to attend @entity8			1
several are @entity14 and @entity134			0
asylum claims are not unusual at sporting events			0
at the 2002 @entity93 more than 20 members of one @entity138 country sought to stay on in @entity18			2
before the 2008 @entity4 seven members of the @entity141 soccer team sought asylum after a qualifying game in the @entity144 , and the entire @entity146 national soccer team fled during a 2009 competition in @entity148			0
five boxers in the @entity25 @entity4 team went missing on sunday from the athletes ' village , pictured @entity153 ( left ) , seen here after defeat to @entity155 of @entity156 in the super heavy weight qualifying event , is another who has gone missing @entity159 ( right ) ducks from @entity161 of @entity162 in their first round @entity164 fight			1

the athletes say they had been treated badly by @entity25 officials
they said there was no support for athletes in their country
the group allege that their promised bonuses had been halved
