by @entity0 published : 20:20 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 20:20 est , 19 february 2013 as @entity3 ’s richest comedian with £ 21 million in the bank , he can afford to indulge			1
so when it comes to losing weight , @entity5 has dispensed with the need to shop , measure and cook			2
instead he has opted to have three meals delivered to his door instead at a cost of up to £ 60 a day			1
mr @entity5 is understood to have enlisted the help of @entity14 , a bespoke diet service , to help him shift the pounds on and off for the last two years			1
@entity3 's richest comedian @entity5 is understood to have enlisted the help of @entity14 , a bespoke diet service , to help him shift the pounds it means he is estimated to have spent up to £ 45,000			1
the stand - up comedian , who has mocked himself for looking like ‘ a fat @entity20 man ’ , is placed on an average daily intake of 1,700 calories when he is on the diet – usually in the run up to gigs and other public or tv appearances			1
the @entity28 guidelines say a man ’s average calorie count should be 2,500			1
when taking a break from his busy working schedule it is believed he allows himself to indulge which explains his famously yo - yoing weight and why he has used the service on and off			1
mr @entity5 has struggled with his size over the years and tried various other ways of slimming down , including cutting out carbohydrates and laying off the booze			2
in 2010 he embarked upon a vigorous training regime that saw him lose two stone but he quickly put the weight back on and moaned that it ‘ all goes to my face ’			2
‘ i ’m one of those people where it all goes to my face , ’ he said			2
‘ i swallow the food and it goes down , then it comes straight back up to my cheeks			0
‘ i did this diet that i heard @entity55 was doing			1
she seems to be in pretty good nick - but it did n’t work for me			0
’ months later he voiced concerns about ‘ looking enormous , not being able to do up my jacket ’ ahead of joining the @entity3 ’s @entity59 judging panel in 2011			0
he said he wanted ‘ to look svelte ’ for the show and it is since then that it is believed he has resorted to paying out hundreds of pounds each week to achieve his goals			0
snacks on the diet include dips with crudités , @entity69 style muffins or a simple handful of pumpkin seeds on a typical day mr @entity5 could breakfast on pancakes with mixed fruit and vanilla yoghurt , followed by smoked venison and poached pear salad for lunch and a dinner of satay chicken with rice			1
snacks include dips with crudités , @entity69 style muffins or a simple handful of pumpkin seeds			0
the menus change daily , which will come as a relief for some of the celebrity clients who have been signed up for as long as eight years			1
others sign up for a short term plan , ahead of film premieres or awards ceremonies			0
@entity95 and @entity96 have used the service in the past			1
and @entity99 has brought a flurry of models and designers signing on short - term to prepare for runway shows , including @entity105 and @entity106 whose diets total around 1,200 calories per day			2
but owner of the @entity14 , @entity110 , insists that the are n’t ‘ faddy ’ diets , despite only covering a short time frame			1
she said : ‘ it ’s not a silly lemon juice plan or anything like that			0
a lot of the models we get coming to us are intelligent people who have long - term careers			0
‘ they are sensible intelligent women , like @entity105 and @entity106 so they know they need to do it properly and not go on some faddy diet			2
‘ it is important to make sure they do n’t risk knocking their metabolism out of shape			0
’ ms @entity110 , who delivers meals to 7,000 well - heeled @entity129 every day , has developed several plans to specialise in different areas , including detox and pregnancy			0
however 90 per cent of her clients are on the weight - loss programme			0
‘ basically the idea of the packages is that clients do n’t need to cook , ’ she said			0
‘ they do n’t need to go food shopping or to measure ingredients out			0
it is all done for them			0
’ mr @entity5 has certainly had the last laugh at the expense of critics who labelled his giggly , bouncy persona ‘ too middle class ’ - by being named the most successful stand - up in the world			0
according to figures from ticket sales tracker @entity152 , the 36 - year - old ’s latest tour made him £ 21million			2
more than 600,000 fans flocked to venues around the @entity3 and @entity158 to see @entity159 ! , @entity161 ’s 71 - date 2012 tour , which included 10 gigs at the massive @entity163 in @entity164			1
his takings from live shows put him alongside the likes of the @entity168 , whose five - gig farewell tour netted £ 22million @entity161 is the only comedian in the top 50 of @entity152 ’s top @entity170 of 2012 list , making him the global stand - up king .			1
