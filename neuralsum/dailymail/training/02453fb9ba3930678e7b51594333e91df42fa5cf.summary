dinner lady @entity25 , 36 , said yesterday , before the news of her latest mri : ' we are desperate			0
right now all we can think about is getting @entity18 to @entity6 for the treatment she needs to survive			2
' we will live in a box if we need to as long as we are together			0
' we have worked hard , our house is all we have but we will sell it to save her			2
‘ some people might criticise us for making the family homeless when we have two other children but i would rather do that than have to tell her brothers we let @entity18 die			0
' what choice do we have ? if we wait for @entity80 funding it will probably be too late			0
’ @entity18 began complaining of pain in her legs in may this year			2
mrs @entity25 said : ‘ @entity18 said her legs were aching , so i told her to rest			1
' like most kids her age she was always on the go but when it got worse i took her to the doctor who said it was just growing pain			0
’ mrs @entity25 said : ' we will live in a box if we need to , as long as we are together			1
we have worked hard , our house is all we have but we will sell it to save her			2
' @entity18 is pictured , right with a children 's entertainer dressed up as @entity153 from @entity154 , at her seventh birthday party in august but in the weeks that followed , mrs @entity25 noticed her daughter falling over and bruises appearing on her legs			1
she went back to the @entity159 and said she was told this time that @entity18 was flat footed which was causing her balance problems			0
but unconvinced mrs @entity25 took her daughter back again and says she was advised to take her for an eye test and again told it was growing pain			1
when her daughter ’s pain got worse she arranged further visits and said on the sixth occasion she was annoyed to have been booked to see a locum gp			0
‘ i felt he would n’t know my daughter and made that clear , ' she said			0
@entity173 beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision			1
the radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy x-rays , used in conventional radiotherapy			0
unlike an x-ray , the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body			0
it enables therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely			0
the beam can be more finely controlled , in both its width and its depth , so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours , with less risk to healthy tissues			0
the treatment has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of many different tumours , including those found in the head and neck , eye , central nervous system , lung , prostate and gastrointestinal tract			0
the precision of the pencil beam scanning makes it especially beneficial in treating tumours adjacent to critical and sensitive organs , such as the eye , brain and spinal cord			0
source : @entity220 ' but to my surprise he was the first to perform a basic neurological test by asking @entity18 to follow his finger with her eyes			0
' she could n’t do it and he told me to get straight to hospital for an mri scan			0
’ at @entity232 in @entity56 , an @entity233 revealed a dangerous build up of fluid on the little girl ’s brain and she was sent by ambulance to @entity239 in @entity240 for urgent surgery the following morning			0
the operation on july 18 revealed a mass on her brain stem was causing the build up			0
mrs @entity25 said : ‘ i was shocked			2
you never think it will happen to you			0
' but at the same time i had known all along it was something more serious than growing pains			2
' the following week a biopsy revealed the tumour was cancerous and on august 4 the devastated couple were told the rare nature of high grade @entity257 ’s in children made it hard to predict how she would respond to treatment			1
but the position on the brain stem made it impossible to operate on and medics hoped to stabilise it with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy when she was older and her brain more developed			0
mr and mrs @entity25 were due to marry later that month on august 23 and mrs @entity25 originally wanted to call off the wedding they had booked back in january but @entity18 was desperate to be a bridesmaid			1
‘ we ’d been so busy in hospital that i had n’t arranged the cars or wedding shoes , it was the last thing on my mind but doctors advised us to go ahead with the wedding because @entity18 was well enough and she was looking forward to it , ’ mrs @entity25 said			1
but first @entity18 turned seven on august 15 and the family hastily arranged a huge party , not knowing if it would be her last			0
two weeks later the couple married surrounded by family and friends			0
@entity18 revelling in her role as chief bridesmaid			0
mrs @entity25 said : ‘ it was all about her , there was n’t a dry eye in the house because nobody knew what the future held			2
‘ she had lost some of her hair because of the surgery but she looked so beautiful			0
’ doctors misdiagnosed @entity305 's brain tumour as growing pains five times before her parents were told she was battling cancer the family have also set up a fundraising page to raise money for @entity18 's treatment @entity18 started chemotherapy two days later but suffered terrible side effects , including nausea , weight loss and a bleed on the brain			1
and when medics scanned her last week the tumour was found to have tripled in size and spread to her spine			2
that is when @entity24 and mrs @entity25 were told proton beam therapy offered the best chance of saving her life and there was no time to waste			1
‘ it would be nice to have a home to come back to after @entity6 , but nothing is more important than saving @entity18 , ' mrs @entity25 said			1
donations have been flooding in , and a second page has been set up to help accept money from the public			0
