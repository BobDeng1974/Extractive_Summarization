a drummer who lost his arm in a freak accident now has a second chance of achieving his dream after being transformed into a ‘ cyborg ’ musician			1
@entity7 lost his right arm below the elbow two years ago after receiving an electric shock while cleaning a vent hood in a restaurant			1
determined to carry on drumming , the student from @entity14 built his own prosthetic device using a brace and some springs that attached to his arm			2
by tensing his biceps , mr @entity7 controls a motor that changes how quick the prosthetic arm moves and how tightly it grips the drumstick			1
a second , autonomous drumstick was added to the robot arm			0
this stick is controlled by its own motor			2
it also uses a microphone and an accelerometer to sense the rhythm mr @entity7 is playing , as well as music from musicians nearby			1
a new complementary beat is then produced using an algorithm modelled on the jazz musicians such as @entity47 and @entity48			0
he could bang the drums by moving his elbow up and down , but could n’t control the speed or bounce of the stick without a wrist or fingers			2
despite this , the device helped him enrol at the @entity59 in @entity60 , and it ’s here that he met professor @entity62			0
professor @entity62 hatched a plan to create a single - stick device with sensors that respond to mr @entity7 ’ bicep muscles			1
‘ now i can flex and send signals to a computer that tightens or loosens the stick and controls the rebound , ’ mr @entity7 said			1
the robotic drumming prosthesis has motors that power two drumsticks			2
the first stick is controlled both physically by the musicians ’ arms and electronically using electromyography ( @entity80 ) muscle sensors			2
video : @entity7 ' superhuman skills by tensing his biceps , mr @entity7 controls a motor that changes how quick the prosthetic arm moves and how tightly it grips the drumstick			1
the other stick ‘ listens ’ to the music being played and improvises			1
this stick is controlled by its own motor			0
it also uses a microphone and an accelerometer to sense the rhythm mr @entity7 is playing , as well as music from musicians nearby			1
a new complementary beat is then produced using an algorithm modelled on the jazz musicians such as @entity47 and @entity48			0
‘ the second drumstick has a mind of its own , ’ said professor @entity62 , founding director of the @entity102			0
‘ the drummer essentially becomes a cyborg			0
it ’s interesting to see him playing and improvising with part of his arm that he does n’t totally control			0
’ professor @entity62 had previously built a robotic percussionist and marimba player that use computer algorithms to improvise with human musicians			0
the prosthesis uses a technique called electromyography to pick up on electrical signals in the arm muscles			1
by tensing his biceps , mr @entity7 controls a motor that changes how quick the prosthetic arm moves and how tightly it grips the drumstick but this prosthesis took his work a step further by adding a ‘ musical brain ’ into the second drum			1
‘ @entity7 can pull the robotic stick away from the drum when he wants to be fully in control , ’ explained professor @entity62			1
‘ or he can allow it to play on its own and be surprised and inspired by his own arm responding to his drumming			0
’ the new prosthetic has already given mr @entity7 capabilities he has n’t had since before the amputation			1
professor @entity62 is now using a @entity138 grant to further develop the technology			0
‘ music is very time sensitive			0
you can hear the difference between two strokes , even if they are a few milliseconds apart , ’ said professor @entity62			0
the robotic drumming prosthesis was created by professor @entity62 ( left ) from the @entity102 in @entity14			2
@entity7 ( right ) said : ' i 'll bet a lot of metal drummers might be jealous of what i can do now ' ‘ if we are able to use machine learning from @entity7 ’s muscles to determine when he intends to drum and have the stick hit at that moment , both arms can be synchronised			1
’ he added that such robotic synchronisation technology could potentially be used in the future to control an embedded , mechanical third arm during time - sensitive operations			2
for example , professor @entity62 ’s algorithms could be used to help astronauts or surgeons perform complex , physical tasks alongside robotic devices			0
for mr @entity7 , the robot arm has transformed his skills			2
because an embedded chip can control the speed of the drumsticks , the prosthesis can be programmed to play two sticks at a different rhythm			0
it can also move the sticks faster than humanly possible			0
‘ i ’ll bet a lot of metal drummers might be jealous of what i can do now , ’ he said			1

@entity7 from @entity14 lost his right arm below elbow 2 years ago
with help of @entity184 , he created robotic arm that uses 2 drumsticks
the first stick is controlled using electrical signals in his arm muscles
other stick ‘ listens ’ to the music being played and improvises its own beat
' metal drummers might be jealous of what i can do now , ’ said mr @entity7
