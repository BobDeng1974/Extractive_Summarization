according to the @entity36 , she wrote : ' he was straightforward , asking me if i wanted to be a prostitute serving some government officials that he had a business relationship with			2
' the tape has caused yet another scandal for @entity45 's ruling @entity44 in the city formerly led by fallen politician @entity47			0
but it may just be the beginning as a whistleblowing former journalist has said he may release similar tapes of more city officials soon			0
the party is already reeling from the scandal which triggered @entity47 's purge and further battered the party 's reputation in the public mind			1
@entity17 , the city that he ran , has been depicted by prosecutors and state media as rife with cover - ups , abuse of power and corruption			0
@entity47 's wife was convicted of murdering a @entity66 businessman , and @entity47 himself faces allegations of corruption and obstruction of justice in the murder case			0
news of the sex tape , which was apparently shot in 2007 , but only leaked this month , comes as @entity45 's newly installed leadership ramps up anti-corruption efforts as it deals with a steady stream of bribery and graft cases that it fears has undermined its authority			1
the tape exploded on the @entity45 internet on november 20 when screenshots of it were uploaded by @entity87 - based former journalist @entity85 to his @entity89 - registered website , an independent online clearing house for corruption allegations			0
' extortion ' : @entity3 ( left ) , who was 18 at the time the video was filmed in 2007 , wrote on a blog that she was paid £ 5,000 to sleep with @entity15 ( right ) which she used to pay for her father 's medical bills the lurid images , apparently taken secretly from a bedside table , show @entity15 having sex with a woman			1
@entity104 told @entity105 that @entity3 , whose face is not visible in the screen grabs , was hired by a construction company to sleep with @entity15 in return for construction contracts			1
the company later tried to use the tape to extort more business from @entity15 , he said			1
@entity104 said he obtained the video from someone inside the @entity116 who gave it on condition of anonymity			2
he said he was also given tapes implicating five other @entity17 officials but is trying to verify their content before releasing them			0
@entity104 said that after the blackmail attempt , @entity15 reported the case to @entity17 officials sometime around 2009 , which led to the construction boss being jailed for a year on unrelated charges and the woman being detained for a month			1
@entity130 reported yesterday that @entity17 's corruption watchdog had pledged a thorough investigation of @entity15 , who was dismissed on friday , but said it had yet to formally receive a report about the allegations against @entity15 or the footage			1
the @entity136 in an editorial today said the case showed that the ' internet is worth being embraced by the country 's corruption busters as a close ally '			0
it also called for greater transparency in handling this and other cases , and listed a few of the lingering questions that the salacious case has thrown up			0
' strangely , the mistress was once detained and the contractor jailed for blackmailing @entity15 , ' it said			1
' what had happened ? ... these are crucial questions waiting to be answered			0
' revealed : screenshots from the video showed mr @entity15 , the party boss of @entity17 's @entity159 , having sex with his mistress disciplined : the @entity7 held an internal investigation into the video after it was first posted with a younger set of incoming leaders announced this month in @entity87 , the government is keen to show that those in power are worthy of their posts and that wrongdoers will be weeded out			1
in his first remarks to the press after being appointed as the new @entity7 chief , @entity171 vowed to tackle corruption			2
the party 's corruption watchdog underlined its zero - tolerance for corruption yesterday			2
' there is no place for corrupt figures to hide away within the party , ' the @entity179 said in a statement quoted by the official @entity130			2
many @entity45 , however , are cynical about the allegations against high - profile party members and that they signal a true crackdown on corruption			2
many think @entity47 was no more or less dirty than the average @entity45 politician and that he was deposed not for his behaviour but because he was on the losing end of factional power struggle			0
@entity193 , 30 , an insurance salesman in @entity87 , bemoaned how ' ordinary people ca n't do anything about ' cases such as @entity15 's			1
' these sorts of abnormal things have become the norm , and we do n't have any say , ' he said			0
@entity104 , the journalist who broke the @entity15 story , said the fact that his website had not been blocked despite the allegations it outlined was a possible sign that the government is more serious than in the past getting tough on corruption			1
' possibly what we are seeing is that the new leaders are perhaps taking steps toward enforcing the constitution , a sliver of a new dawn , ' he said			0
the @entity45 term for mistress — ernai ; or second wife — is thought to go back to the polygamous tradition that developed amongst some of the country 's ruling elite during the country 's imperial period			0
keeping a mistress is still viewed as a status symbol among some senior @entity45 government officials and wealthy businessmen as has been revealed by recent scandals - including that of @entity15			1
some government ministers have been revealed to have had multiple mistresses			0
one former minister is believed to have had as many as 18 mistresses , according to the @entity235			0
the women involved are often bought lavish gifts by their lover , from jewellery to luxury apartments and sports cars			0
the issue has , however , led to a growing public backlash , as stories of the excesses involved have beaten the state 's censors to been leaked onto the internet .			2
