by @entity0 for @entity1 big - hitting @entity3 cricketer @entity2 was at his destructive best in @entity5 when he smashed the glass of the @entity8 commentary box with a damaging six			1

' beautifully struck ' , he said , before reacting on impact			0
' oh , it 's hit the commentary box window and there 's glass all over the place			2

the all - rounder was one of a number of @entity3 batsmen clubbing sixes across the park including @entity54 92 and @entity55 who hit 83			2
the ball which @entity2 drove off @entity13 and into the stands @entity2 said he thought the ball was headed for the box from the moment it left his bat the ball on its way to the commentary box the window was the same one @entity68 @entity67 hit two years ago @entity17 , who was too busy shaking shards of glass out of his shirt , later joked about @entity2 's damaging shot - tweeting to his followers that he had chicken and glass shards for lunch			1

he said he had an inkling the ball was headed for the commentary box from the moment it left the bat			2
the commentators react to the ball hitting the re-enforced glass window @entity15 offered to give the @entity3 bowler a souvenir piece of glass @entity2 's tweet following the match @entity25 won convincingly ' i thought it was going to hit , and i was just wondering what it was going to do , ' he said			1
' i did n’t see it shatter , i just saw some of the commentators brushing away a bit of glass , so it was a good thing it did n’t shatter everywhere and the ball did n’t go through			0
' i think another window up here ( outside the players ’ dressing room ) had that shattered look to it , and i ’m glad no - one got injured out of it			0
' the damaging batsmen , who has also been in good form with the ball , said he was ' just trying to adjust ' to the conditions of being out in the middle			0
