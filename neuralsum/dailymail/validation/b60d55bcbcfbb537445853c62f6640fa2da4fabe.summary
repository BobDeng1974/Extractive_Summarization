scientists have found that pollution coming from @entity3 countries is affecting weather in the @entity5			1
the effect that pollution in @entity3 may have on other parts of the world has been examined by both @entity7 's @entity12 ( @entity12 ) and the @entity13 , @entity7 's @entity6 reported			1
@entity14 , who is part of @entity12 , and @entity16 looked at the potential link between more intense storms in the @entity19 , deeper clouds over the @entity21 , and @entity3 's period of economic growth -- all of which happened in the same 30 - year period , according to the news outlet			1
research : scientists have found that pollution coming from @entity3 countries is affecting weather in the @entity5			1
a hazy @entity31 skyline is seen in this file photo ' we found that pollution from @entity35 affects cloud development in the @entity21 and strengthens extratropical cyclones , ' @entity16 , who is a postdoctoral fellow , told @entity6			1
@entity14 , pictured , was one of the researchers involved in the project @entity16 told the news outlet that more powerful extratropical cyclones likely played a role in 2013 winter weather on the @entity44			2
he also said that during extratropical cyclones , a larger amount of water undergoes condensation on aerosols -- due to greater pollution			0
heat released from the process can contribute to a cloud becoming both larger and deeper , @entity6 explained			0
@entity14 told the news outlet ' before , we thought about the @entity56 contrast : the @entity57 has more land , the @entity59 has more ocean			0
' that difference is important to global atmospheric circulation			0
' now , in addition to that , there 's a @entity67 contrast			0
@entity68 and @entity69 are reducing emissions ; @entity3 is increasing them			2
' that change also affects the global circulation and perturbs the climate			0
' speaking to the @entity75 , @entity14 said ' during the wintertime , human - induced pollution such as coal burning in many @entity3 cities can create smog that lasts for weeks			2
cold conditions : postdoctoral fellow @entity16 has said that more powerful extratropical cyclones likely played a role in 2013 winter weather in the @entity85			0
( a woman is seen in @entity87 in this february 2013 file photo ) ' under favorable wind conditions , pollution particles can be transported downwind across the @entity21 , where winter storms are prevalent			1
' however , @entity14 told @entity92 that he does not know to what extent powerful @entity19 storms can cause severe weather in other parts of the @entity5			1
' we have not reached a final conclusion yet , ' he told the media outlet .			0
