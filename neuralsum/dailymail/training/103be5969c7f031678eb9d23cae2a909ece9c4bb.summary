from his battalion of female guards to his penchant for pitching tents on the lawns of the @entity6 , deposed @entity8 dictator @entity7 was as strange as he was dangerous			1
now the plastic surgeon the despot shared with @entity12 's @entity11 has revealed his bizarre taste for cosmetic enhancement - done without anaesthetic in the early hours of the morning			1
' he wanted lipo filling because a desert man gets bad skin and we did the hair implant too , ' explained dr @entity21 , a breast augmentation specialist based in @entity23			2
' he added : ' he [ @entity7 ] was afraid that somebody might kill him			1
' the @entity35 appears in a new @entity27 documentary , @entity36 : @entity7 's @entity37 , which delves into the peculiar lifestyle enjoyed by the late dictator			1
it also looks at the darker side of life in @entity7 's @entity8 and goes inside the palace where the dictator kept his ' harem ' of girls , some as young as 14 , and raped them repeatedly			1
many were virgins kidnapped from schools and universities and kept prisoner for years in specially designed secret sex lairs hidden within @entity53 or his many palaces			2
speaking to the @entity59 , one teacher at a @entity58 school recalled how the girls were all very young			0
ruin : the remains of the @entity58 palace where dr @entity21 conducted operations on @entity8 's @entity7 ‘ some were only 14 , ’ she said			1
‘ they would simply take the girl they wanted			0
they had no conscience , no morals , not an iota of mercy even though she was a mere child			0
’ the teacher also feared for her own daughter who was attending @entity53 , who had told her mother that the community around the university lived in fear when a visit from the colonel was announced			2
‘ the girls he wanted would be rounded up and sent to him , ’ she said			0
‘ one just disappeared and they never found her again , despite her father and brothers searching for her			0
' another was found three months later , cut , raped and lying in the middle of a park			0
she had been left for dead			0
’ dr @entity21 , by contrast , told filmmakers that his memories of @entity7 are largely good but complained of his insistence on completing procedures in the small hours			1
bizarre : according to dr @entity21 , @entity7 insisted on having procedures without anaesthetic bodyguards : many of @entity7 's famous battalion of female guards had also been abused by the despot surgery fans : along with @entity7 , dr @entity26 also counts @entity12 's @entity11 among his clients ' he was a very nice man , he was a television man , ' says the doctor			1
' [ but we would do operations at ] 2am in the morning			2
' the facilities , however , did please dr @entity21 , who carried out the operations on @entity7 in the tunnels beneath his @entity58 palace			2
' it was like a big hospital , ' he remembers			0
' the surgery room in the bunker was very good			0
' but while @entity21 seems unscarred by his encounters with the evil @entity7 , not everyone was so lucky			2
as one former inhabitant of the dictator 's harem , who spoke to the @entity27 , revealed : ‘ i will never forget that first time , that moment			1
' he violated my body and pierced my soul with a dagger			0
that blade will never come out			0
’ @entity36 : @entity7 's @entity37 , monday night at 10pm on @entity132			1
