by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 02:37 est , 4 january 2013 a 15 - year - old is suing the @entity3 state for the legal right to be called ' @entity5 '			1
she was baptised by the name - blaer in her own language - but the country does not allow babies to be called anything that is not on a government - approved list			1
a handful of other states , including @entity15 and @entity16 , also have this rule			1
@entity3 are generally comfortable with a firm state role , and abide by the @entity19 , a list of 1,712 male names and 1,853 female names			1
identity crisis : @entity24 , 15 , left , was given her name by her mother , @entity26 - but they were later told by the priest who baptised @entity29 that it had been a mistake all fit @entity3 grammar and pronunciation rules and officials claim they will protect children from embarrassment			1
parents can take from the list or apply to a committee with alternative ideas			1
@entity24 's mother , @entity26 , said she learned her daughter 's name was not on the register only after the priest who baptised the child later informed her he had mistakenly allowed it			1
' i had no idea that the name was n't on the list , the famous list of names that you can choose from , ' said mrs @entity26 , adding she knew a @entity29 whose name was accepted in 1973			1
rock ' n ' roll : the name @entity57 was recently permitted because it fits the guidelines - but choices such as @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 were rejected because the letter ' c ' is not in @entity3 's 32 - letter alphabet this time , the panel turned it down on the grounds that the word @entity29 takes a masculine article , despite the fact that it was used for a female character in a novel by @entity3 's revered @entity75 - winning author @entity74			1
given names are even more significant in tiny @entity3 than in many other countries - everyone is listed in the phone book by their first names , while surnames are based on a parent 's given name			1
even the president , @entity84 , is addressed simply as @entity84			1
as a consequence of the ruling , @entity29 has no official name and is only identified as ' @entity88 ' - or ' girl ' - on all her official documents			1
this has led to years of frustration as she has had to explain the story at the bank , when renewing her passport and when dealing with the country 's bureaucracy			1
her mother is hoping that will change with her suit , the first time someone has challenged a names committee decision in court			2
although the law has become more relaxed in recent years - with the name @entity57 permitted as fitting the guidelines - choices such as @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity108 , and @entity62 have been rejected outright because the letter ' c ' is not part of @entity3 's 32 - letter alphabet			1
' the law is pretty straightforward so in many cases it 's clearly going to be a yes or a no , ' said @entity116 , the head of the panel of three appointed by the government to a four - year term			1
other cases are more subjective			2
' what one person finds beautiful , another person may find ugly , ' she acknowledged , pointing to ' @entity125 ' as one unacceptable case because it was deemed too close to ' @entity127			2
' the board also has veto power over people who want to change their names later in life - rejecting , for instance , middle names like @entity134 and @entity135 1			1

monkey ( @entity160 ) when the artist @entity162 applied to have his name legally changed to @entity164 , which he had used in one form or another since age 15 , he said he knew full well the committee would reject his application			0
' i was inspired by @entity171 who changed his name to @entity171 and @entity173 who changed his to @entity173 and then @entity173 with seemingly little thought or criticism , ' he said			0
' i applied to the committee , but of course i got the " no " that i expected			0
' on his 30th birthday , he bought a full - page advertisement that read , ' from february 1 , 2006 , i hereby change my name to @entity164			1
i ask the nation , my friends and colleagues to respect my decision			0
' he added : ' i can understand a clause to protect children from being named something like " @entity190 " , but it is strange that an adult can not change his name to what he truly wants			0
mrs @entity26 said she is prepared to take the case all the way to the country 's @entity197 if a court does n't overturn the commission decision on january 25			0
' so many strange names have been allowed , which makes this even more frustrating because @entity29 is a perfectly @entity3 name , ' said mrs @entity26			1
' it seems like a basic human right to be able to name your child what you want , especially if it does n't harm your child in any way			0
' and my daughter loves her name			0

@entity29 is officially known as ' girl ' - which can cause *trouble* at the bank
she was baptised by the banned name but a priest then said it was an error
