@entity0 has revealed that @entity2 creator @entity1 wanted her to play the role of @entity5 's wife @entity4 and not dr. @entity6 , his psychiatrist			1

' ... and he agreed with me that i 'd done it already and it was n't really incredible creative casting for him			0
he said , ' you want to play @entity6 ? ' and i said , ' yeah , i want to play @entity58 '' so i left on that , and he gave it to me			1
' speaking about the untimely death of @entity10 in 2013 , @entity0 said his passing was devastating and a wake up call			2
