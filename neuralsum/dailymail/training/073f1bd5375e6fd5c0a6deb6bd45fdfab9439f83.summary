by @entity0 published : 13:20 est , 20 january 2014 updated : 15:10 est , 20 january 2014 a fourth member of a gang branded the ' @entity4 ' has been named and shamed after exploiting frail old men for cash - by stealing kisses from them			1
the four women would target the elderly by posing as carers or offering to help with their weekly shopping before asking for and taking their money			1
@entity15 captured one of the women flirting and planting a kiss on the cheek one of the victims after bluffing her way into his home			1
caught : @entity25 ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) who targeted elderly men for money at least 40 victims aged in their 70s and 80s handed over cash to @entity25 , 36 , @entity26 , @entity32 40 , and @entity33 , 36 , after the women carried out activities on their neighbourhoods looking for likely targets			1
police fear there are many other elderly men targeted by the women in @entity42 , @entity43 , but are too embarassed to come forward			1
today @entity25 joined accomplices @entity44 , @entity46 and @entity47 by being issued with an anti social behaviour order , which has banned them from all sheltered housing and supported living accommodation in their hometown			2
the orders say they can not offer to provide any services for gain - except for legitimate employment or business			2
@entity33 , left , and @entity58 , right , were part of a three - strong gang dubbed the ' @entity4 ' , who preyed on elderly men in @entity42 , stealing money as they posed as carers they also can not carry @entity65 or bank cards belonging to another person			1
after the hearing at @entity69 , inspector @entity70 of @entity71 said : ' this activity has been going on for some years and the victims we know about are potentially only the tip of the iceberg			1
' there are likely to be many other vulnerable victims we are not aware of who have not reported issues due to embarrassment or a lack of capacity to do so			1
' a lot of this activity has taken place behind closed doors and so has been very difficult to get a handle on			2
' this is a great result for us and indeed the community of @entity42 as a whole			1
' most of the victims have suffered some financial loss , as well as being made to feel threatened and intimidated in their own homes			1
the victims ’ vulnerabilities and associated problems have in the past presented considerable difficulties in mounting substantive criminal prosecutions			1
cctv images showing one of the women flirting with one of her victims and planting a kiss on his cheek ' these @entity111 will give us the ability to closely monitor these individuals ’ activities and hopefully prevent many more vulnerable people becoming victims			1
it will also give us the means to get these individuals quickly before a court for any breaches			2
' local @entity124 councillor @entity123 said : ' i ’m delighted that these women have been given @entity111			1
' they preyed on men who were particularly vulnerable			1
' a lot of hard work has been done by our officers working in partnership with the police and other agencies to gather the evidence to achieve this result			2
' i would hope that this will give people who feel they ’re being exploited the confidence to tell us and not feel embarrassed			2
if you are a victim of this type of crime , or any type of anti-social behaviour , then please tell someone , it ’s the only way we can put a stop to it			0
' police said officers gathered a dossier of evidence showing the three women stealing from and offering services to vulnerable members of the community over the past year			1
it included taking inappropriate sums of money to assist with domestic chores such as shopping			0
they also offered sexual services for financial rewards			0
@entity44 had previously served three years jail after talked her way into the home of a couple aged 79 and 83 before stealing £ 740			2
@entity26 ( right ) arriving at @entity172			0
@entity44 had perviously served three years jail after talking her way into the home of a couple before stealing £ 740 she was captured on @entity15 taking money from one of her victims after giving him a kiss			1
@entity178 , 55 , whose father @entity179 , 80 , was targeted by the women in another incident said : ' my dad has has @entity184 ’s and now he keeps repeating : " have i told you i ’ve been robbed ? ” he has been left upset and confused			1
' he keeps saying " i thought i was safe here "			0
' mr @entity178 added : ' i am so angry with these women			2
they ’re just horrible people			0
your natural human instinct is to look after vulnerable old people yet these women pretended to care when they did n’t			2
' in my dad ’s case the woman said she was his carer but when he let her in , he realised straight away that she was n’t his carer because they have a set routine and this woman was n’t behaving in a way that the carers usually do			0
' she started looking around and asked him if he had any money			0
@entity204 knows what she took			0
but apparently she was in and out straight away			0
even if it was only a couple of quid , the effect it has had is awful			0
' then another time they came to the window and asked for a cigarette so he gave them one and she said ' have you not got anymore ? i know you ’ve got more			0
' ' they imposed themselves on him			0
they were making excuses trying to get into the building			0
they ’re preying on the vulnerable			0
i ’m not sure what good an asbo will do ? some take pride in it , do n’t they			0
they should be in jail			0
' the orders will remain in place until december 2015 .			0
