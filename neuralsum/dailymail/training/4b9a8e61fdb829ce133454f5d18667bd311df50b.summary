at 5.5 inches tall , the larger version of the new @entity8 , believed to be launching next year , poses a sartorial problem for those accustomed to carrying their phone on their person			1
and while @entity17 - clad teens might be embracing the fannypack , it is hardly an appropriate solution for those of us who remember the look the first time around			1
@entity36 's @entity35 - style skirts come with oversized square pockets that could comfortably accommodate the jumbo smartphone , while @entity40 's transparent raincoat allows one to show it off with pride			1
