by @entity0 when @entity1 left @entity3 first time around , he did so not so much as under a cloud as under angry , darkened skies			1
a public spat with former manager @entity7 stamped the player ’s ticket to @entity10 – initially with @entity11 – and there seemed no doubt back then that it was of the one - way variety			1
if the chances of the player returning to the home of his boyhood heroes looked slim as he embarked on a tour of duty including outposts like @entity23 , then the prospect of him skippering the @entity25 side one day looked next to nil			2
turnaround : @entity1 is set for the armband against @entity28 little wonder then that upon being handed the armband in @entity31 by @entity32 last week in the absence of the injured @entity34 , the 28 - year - old midfielder took a moment to take stock			1
whilst @entity1 had occasionally enjoyed the honour under previous manager @entity40 , never before had he led the team out for a @entity43 tie			1
‘ being captain is huge , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ growing up a @entity3 fan , to captain the side – be it in a friendly or a reserve match , never mind a @entity51 qualifier , is a proud moment			1
it ’s a huge honour and i ’m delighted			2
‘ when i left @entity3 the first time , i never thought something like this would happen			1
when you leave , coming back is the last thing on your mind – never mind captaining the club			2
‘ what was the secret ? keep believing in yourself and hard work is the main thing			2
but it ’s a proud moment to stand in for @entity66 and i ’m delighted			2
’ now a seasoned @entity51 and international player , @entity1 might well have been forgiven for glossing over the honour bestowed on him in @entity28			1
a lifetime of following the club taught him better , though , while the esteemed company he joined served to remind him of his responsibilities			0
in talks : @entity1 chatting with @entity74 in training ‘ @entity76 was a great captain when i was growing up			1
@entity40 , too , and @entity77 captained the side			0
‘ there are guys like @entity81 - and @entity82 won the @entity51 as captain			1
‘ i grew up as a @entity3 fan and watched some of these guys captain the club			1
it ’ s a dream come true to do it			0
‘ it is an important role			0
you just have to lead by example			1
@entity34 has done that for three years and i will try to carry that on			0
‘ it ’s a great confidence boost to be handed the armband after he got injured			2
he ’s a great captain and it ’s good that the manager has come in and seen me as a captain , too			0
‘ there is an added responsibility but you just try to do things the way you normally do			0
‘ the responsibility is in the back of your mind , but you just need to keep doing your normal things			0
’ captain 's role : facing the press ahead of the key @entity51 game very much his own man , @entity1 believes there would be no sense in him attempting to merely parrot the approach of @entity34 in the lead - up to tonight ’s second leg			1
‘ we are two different characters , ’ he insisted			0
‘ we are good friends off the pitch and hopefully some of what he does rubs off on me			0
‘ do i see myself as a leader ? i suppose i ’d like to think i lead by example in some ways			2
but that ’s for other people to say			0
if i ’m captain , i ’ll just look to lead by example			2
‘ i ’ll speak to younger players but i do that anyway			0
i try to help the young guys naturally			0
’ for all @entity3 lead by a goal going into tonight ’s match , the job is n’t yet done			1
given the high - stakes game they hope to be a part of , @entity32 ’s side can assume nothing			2
‘ we just look after ourselves and hopefully that will be enough , ’ @entity1 added			1
‘ it wo n’t be easy			0
it never is when a team camps in to defend			0
‘ but we created chances in @entity31 and hopefully we can do the same again and take them this time			1
‘ maybe it should have been more convincing over there but it ’s early in the season and that bit of sharpness will come			0
there are just small things that we need to work on			0
