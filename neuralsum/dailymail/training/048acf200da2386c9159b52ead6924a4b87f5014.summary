@entity0 will have the grim task of ordering the @entity2 to shoot down a passenger airliner over @entity4 to prevent a suicide attack on the @entity6			1
the prime minister will have his finger on the trigger as an unprecedented defensive ' ring of steel ' is thrown up to protect @entity12 2012			1
the public will witness a show of military strength not seen at home since the @entity17			0
the security in place to prevent a september 11 - style atrocity or @entity22 - style terror attack as the eyes of the world are on @entity12 includes : pressure : @entity0 will decide whether or not to use the missiles in an emergency yesterday it was made clear that mr @entity0 would be ultimately responsible for a decision to fire missiles to blast a suicide jet , possibly carrying terrified innocent civilians , out of the skies			1
general sir @entity37 , in charge of military operations during @entity36 , revealed the unenviable task would rest at the ' highest political level '			0
mr @entity0 possesses emergency powers to authorise the military to bring down planes or helicopters to stop an atrocity during this summer 's sporting showcase			1
news of mr @entity0 's role came as it was revealed that surface - to - air missiles could be deployed at six different sites across @entity12 during the @entity6			1
the @entity50 in @entity51 and the @entity52 in @entity53 , both in east @entity12 , have been identified as potential sites			1
launch site : the @entity56 will station soldiers and high - velocity surface - to - air missiles on the @entity59 , seen centre , in @entity12 @entity61 and @entity62 , both in south east @entity12 , plus @entity63 in the @entity64 in @entity65 and @entity66 at @entity67 in @entity68 are other possible sites			1
the surface - to - air missiles will be deployed as the third tier of defence aimed at slower or smaller aircraft , and the final decision as to whether they will be fired will rest with mr @entity0			1
the six sites are all potential locations for ground - based air defence systems , should the government decide to deploy them during the @entity6			1
residents in the private , gated flats next to the @entity80 in @entity81 have received a leaflet warning them that a team of ten soldiers and police will be placed at the building – home to 700 people – for the duration of this summer ’s games			2
security point : the @entity94 in @entity12 is one of the proposed missile sites closest to the @entity97 it follows an announcement by defence secretary @entity100 in november that missiles might be used to safeguard the @entity6 site			1
no final decision has been made about this potential deployment but it does form part of @entity106 , a major exercise in which security preparations are being tested this week			2
last night , the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) confirmed the missiles would be deployed within the next few days			2
they describe them as ‘ a useful deterrent ’			0
defence secretary @entity100 said : ' support for the @entity6 will be an important task for defence in 2012 and this exercise is about pushing our people and our systems to the limit to ensure that we are ready for the challenge			1
' the majority of this exercise will be played out in full view of the public and i hope that it will have a secondary effect of reassuring the @entity4 people that everything possible is being done to ensure this will be a safe and secure @entity6 and @entity131			0
' resident @entity132 , a journalist , said the @entity109 leaflet says the missiles will be fired only as a last resort			2
he said : ‘ they are going to have a test run next week , putting high - velocity missiles on the roof just above our apartment			2
they ’re stationing police and military in the tower of the building for two months			0
@entity61 , one of six positions that could be used to home missiles during the @entity6 @entity62 at @entity152 , @entity151 may have a station for surface - to - air missiles warning : high - velocity surface - to - air missiles could be stationed on the residential block in @entity12 to ward off airborne terror threats @entity158 , in @entity66 , @entity68 , has also been earmarked to protect @entity12 the @entity159 in @entity53 , east @entity12 , which could play host to a missile station the @entity63 , @entity65 , is another possible site for missile deployment ‘ it ’s a private , gated community with an old watch tower which is now a lift shaft			1
‘ we have an @entity109 leaflet saying the building is the only suitable place in the area			0
it says there will be ten officers plus police present 24/7			0
i ’m not sure if they are going to live in the building			0
we have a gym and a pool and people have seen them there so it makes you think it will be some sort of @entity56 base – it ’s not ideal			0
‘ the property management company which runs the place put up posters and gave out the leaflets today			0
protection : defence secretary @entity100 saw some of the @entity190 ground - to - air missile launchers during a visit to @entity192 near @entity193 , earlier this year ‘ the general tone was , “ great news , are n’t we lucky ” , but that ’s not normal , it ’s not something people should have put on them			1
‘ i ’ve looked these up [ the missiles ] and i do n’t think they ’re the kind of thing you can fire over a highly populated area like @entity51 , think of the debris			2
’ mr @entity132 said the leaflet poses a series of questions residents might ask , such as : ‘ will this make me a target for terrorists ? ’ the 28 - year - old said : ‘ but the answer on it is that we will be safer with it here ‘ from the few people i ’ve spoken to , and the security we have here , they ’re not happy about it			2
i do n’t think it needs to be here at all			0
’ the @entity227 's @entity226 fighters are now operational and will protect @entity12 and @entity4 airspace from any airborne terrorist threat @entity231 helicopters will be able to respond to threats during the @entity6 quickly the @entity234 airborne early warning and control force aircraft will be on hand @entity237 helicopters are another part of the fleet on hand to strike if there is an attack @entity243 : security agencies fear the @entity6 site in @entity246 , east @entity12 , will be targeted by terrorists and are preparing for a range of difference scenarios there are no plans to have soldiers patrolling the streets during the @entity6 but marines will be working as part of the operation on the @entity257 and in @entity258			1
the overall 23,700 - strong security force for the @entity6 includes a mix of military , private security guards and at least 3,000 unpaid @entity36 volunteers who will be used at the start of the security process			0
it includes a 13,500 - strong military force , which is more than the 10,000 that were deployed to @entity268 , who will guard the @entity6			0
there will be 7,500 military who are set to be deployed inside venues to do screening and search tasks , largely in the vehicle search areas .			0

sites across @entity12 could be used as surface - to - air missile posts to protect games
@entity0 to have final say on missile use - and would be the man to *approve* a launch if they are *installed*
defence secretary @entity100 had announced last year missiles could be used
