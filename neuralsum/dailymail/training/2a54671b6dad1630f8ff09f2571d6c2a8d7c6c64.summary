a rural township in south - central @entity1 is letting motorists know it 's not a gun - free zone			1
@entity4 reported thursday that @entity6 - just south of @entity5 - is spending about $ 500 on the group of signs			1
four of them have been installed , with 12 more in the works			0
they 'll eventually be posted along every road at the township 's borders			0
seen here is supervisor @entity21 deterrent : sign on @entity23 declaring @entity6 not a gun - free zone			1
it is one of 16 going up around the township			2
a township supervisor said he proposed the idea in response to home invasions and petty crime			2
' we want to welcome people in , but we want to let them know that if they 're here for criminal activity , they 're not welcome , ' @entity6 supervisor @entity21 told @entity40 4			1
' ( criminals ) might look at that sign and think , '' i might be about to have a bad day ''			0
' mr @entity21 said the decision to erect the signs can via vote from the town 's five supervisors			1
however , critics are not convinced			0
more to come : @entity6 supervisor @entity21 ( right ) erects one of the signs pro-guns : mr @entity21 should the point of the signs is to deter crime ' these signs are silly , because the @entity60 guarantees the right of law - abiding , responsible citizens anywhere to own guns in their homes , ' @entity57 , a spokesman for the @entity58 , told @entity66			1
' as a matter of fact , no jurisdiction in @entity68 completely prohibits the carrying of guns in public			0
' further , executive director of @entity74 , @entity75 , said the signs are actually dangerous			2
' the intent seems to be to scare those who might consider criminal activity , ' @entity75 said			0
' the likely effect will be to embolden a shoot - first , @entity83 mentality			1
' plenty more : a local reporter shows the 12 or so more signs that are yet to go up around the town but mr @entity21 is not affected by the people who do n't agree with his signs			2
he said that people do n't realize the right to carry firearms has been curtailed in other parts of the country			0
he believes its important to stand up for such rights			0
at least one other town - @entity97 , @entity96 is considering following @entity6 's move .			1

plans for 16 signs to be erected in around @entity6 , @entity1
town - south of @entity5 - has a *population* of *3,000*
town supervisors hope signs will deter crime
critics say they are dangerous and could *enforce* a ' shoot first mentality '
