former @entity0 and @entity2 midfielder @entity1 is confident misfiring striker @entity3 can rediscover his goalscoring touch in the near future			1
@entity3 joined @entity0 this summer on a two - year loan deal from @entity7 but has failed to replicate the form he displayed during his time with both @entity10 and @entity11			1
the @entity13 striker has scored just one goal in 10 league appearances for the @entity0 and has not started in @entity0 's last three @entity17 games			1
@entity3 has struggled since moving to @entity0 on a two - year loan deal in the summer the @entity13 striker ( left ) has scored just one goal in 10 @entity17 appearances this season ' if you want to see the real @entity22 ( @entity3 ) , then you have to wait , ' @entity1 told @entity24 - based sports newspaper @entity23			1
' the current @entity3 is not the one we all knew			2
' he is coming off two seasons in which he played very little , so it 's not easy to find oneself after that			0
' @entity3 must be aware of what he has gone through , he must rediscover self - confidence and belief in himself not just through words , but through action			2
' moreover , we can not forget that football in @entity13 and @entity36 offers more spaces than in @entity38 , hence , a striker has at least four or five chances per game			0
' for him @entity17 is completely new			2
' ex-milan star @entity1 insists @entity3 will come good once he rediscovers his ' self - belief ' @entity1 , who was a team - mate of @entity3 at @entity10 in the 2002 - 03 season , believes the 30 - year - old striker still has to find his feet in @entity0 but firmly believes the @entity46 can follow the footsteps of his compatriot @entity48 and succeed in @entity38 's top flight			1
@entity48 moved to @entity50 in the summer of 2013 from @entity51 and struggled early on before becoming a regular for the @entity24 giants			1
' @entity48 is a great example , ' @entity1 said			2
' after two or three months he adapted to the @entity38 training and match tempo , but he was in a side that had won the @entity58 and he and @entity59 were the only additions to the team			0
' i think the challenges for @entity3 are , other than settling in , finding his place in a team that has profoundly changed with respect to last season due to the new coach ( @entity68 )			0
@entity50 striker @entity48 , scoring against @entity69 , originally struggled to adapt to @entity17 but @entity48 is now a regular for @entity50 and @entity3 can follow in his footsteps , believes @entity1 ' when you build a mosaic with five or six changes out of 11 pieces , it is logical to have fewer guarantees and the newcomers will feel even more out of place			1
' when a foreign player joins a consolidated team , it is easier to adapt			0
' when you put together a puzzle , you start with the outline and fill in the gaps , but if every summer you break up the outline ... ' @entity87 could well be left on the bench as he needs time to adapt			0
' it 's down to @entity68 and the player to understand the best course of action			0
' @entity3 ( right ) tries to compete for the ball with @entity96 's @entity95 ( left ) last month			0

@entity3 is currently at @entity0 on a two - year loan from @entity7

ex-ac @entity0 midfielder @entity1 believes @entity3 will come good
@entity1 says once he ' rediscovers his self - belief ' we *'ll* see ' real ' @entity3
@entity48 took time to adapt to @entity17 but is a @entity50 regular
