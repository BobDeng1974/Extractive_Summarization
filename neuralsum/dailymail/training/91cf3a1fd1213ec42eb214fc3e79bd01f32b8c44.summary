@entity1 striker @entity0 has accepted responsibility for most of his past misdemeanours but is still ' upset ' over his punishment for racially abusing @entity6 's @entity5			1
the 27 - year - old is set to make his competitive comeback from a four - month worldwide ban next week in @entity10 against @entity11 at the @entity12 , which was imposed after he bit @entity15 defender @entity14 during the @entity16			1
while he accepts his current suspension , and the 10 - game ban imposed for a similar incident involving @entity21 's @entity20 were his own fault , he is still unhappy over how his argument with @entity5 in october 2011 was dealt with			1
@entity0 was found guilty of racially abusing @entity5 in 2011 and says it still upsets him @entity5 celebrated in front of @entity0 when @entity6 won that season 's return fixture at @entity28 ' it is good to accept that you have made a mistake and that 's what i did , ' he told his club 's official website fcbarcelona.com in reference to the @entity14 bite			1
' i left it a few days because you have to remember that i 'm only human and sometimes it 's hard to face the truth			2
' i found it hard to take in and to realise what i had done			0
those were days when i did n't want to know about it			0
' i just wanted to be with my wife and children , who supported me through that time			0
' i did n't want to listen to anybody , or speak to anybody			0
i did n't want to accept it			0
when i say i 'm sorry it 's because i regret something			2
@entity0 refused to shake hands with @entity5 the next time the two players met , after refusing to apologise the @entity56 's snub angered @entity5 , but @entity0 insists he did nothing wrong and was wrongly found guilty @entity0 and @entity5 have since shaken hands , but the @entity1 star insists he was ' accused without evidence ' ' but they have also sometimes judged me on things that are n't true , such as the racism thing			1
i was accused without evidence and that 's what grieved me the most			2
' the others were actions when it was me who did wrong			0
i accepted that and begged forgiveness , but the racism thing , when i was accused without evidence , that did upset me			0
' @entity0 has admitted he was in the wrong when he bit @entity14 at last summer 's @entity16 the striker says it is good to admit that he has made a mistake , ahead of hm the ban next week @entity0 had previously been found guilty of biting @entity20 , for which he was banned for 10 games @entity6 faced @entity81 in a @entity83 match			1
in the 57th minute @entity0 fouled @entity5 and tempers flared at the next corner			1
they squared up to each other and @entity5 asked why @entity0 kicked him			1
@entity0 said he should forget about it , these things happen			1
@entity5 claims @entity0 then became racially abusive , using the word ' negro '			1
@entity0 denies using the word in that clash			1
@entity5 is clearly wound up , but nearby players do not seem particularly bothered			2
a few minutes later @entity94 calls the pair together			0
@entity0 apologises and tries to pat @entity5 on the head			1
it is alleged @entity5 said : ' do n't touch me , you @entity99 , ' to which @entity0 replies : ' porque , negro ? ' @entity5 catches @entity103 two minutes later and is booked			1
he allegedly shouts at @entity104 : ' you 're only booking me because i 'm black			0
' @entity0 is bemused , saying : ' i called him something his team - mates call him and even they were surprised by his reaction			2
' @entity0 has been allowed to play in friendlies during his ban after successfully appealing against an original ruling which prevented him from being involved in any football - related activity			2
on monday he scored twice for @entity113 in a 3 - 0 win over @entity115 but admits he can not wait to end his competitive exile			0
' the first two months were the hardest because i did n't feel like a footballer			0
that was the worst part , ' he added			0
' it is always good to accept your mistakes but what angered me most was not feeling like a professional , not feeling like another worker , like other footballers do			0
that 's what hurt me the most			0
