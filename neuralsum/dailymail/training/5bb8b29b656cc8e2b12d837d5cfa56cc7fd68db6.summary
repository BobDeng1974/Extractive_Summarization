@entity0 launched his move to oust the entire @entity3 board by formally submitting a demand for a general meeting on friday night			1
as hundreds of fans gathered outside @entity7 in protest at plans to mortgage off @entity7 and @entity10 in return for a £ 10million loan from @entity13 , the @entity15 - based businessman insisted he is confident of gaining the 51 per cent backing required to remove chairman @entity17 , chief executive @entity18 , finance director @entity19 and non-executive director @entity20			1
@entity0 , the largest single shareholder at the club , proposes that he is elected onto the board in their places alongside fellow former club director @entity10 and @entity25 , a one - time managing director of @entity26			1
@entity0 has called a general meeting to ask @entity3 shareholders to rout the entire @entity7 board @entity3 fans protest before friday 's match with @entity32 over claims that @entity7 is to be mortgaged off the @entity3 board considered mortgaging off @entity7 in return for a £ 10million loan from @entity13 @entity18 and @entity19 would , initially , retain their executive roles — but be off the board — before new appointments were made			1
the notice seeking the @entity5 was hand delivered to @entity7 on friday night , the day after it emerged that advance notices of security over the stadium and @entity45 had been lodged at the @entity46 of @entity47 on behalf of @entity13 ’s @entity49 firm			1
the move has been viewed as a precursor to the board accepting @entity13 ’s loan ahead of a rival funding offer from a @entity56 - led group			0
@entity57 , one of @entity45 ’s associates , visited @entity7 on friday for talks after the consortium pledged to up their initial £ 5m proposal in a bid to block @entity13			2
@entity3 defender @entity63 ( right ) tackles @entity32 ' @entity64 on a snowy night at @entity7 @entity3 fans gesture towards @entity32 ' supporters as a board explains why the game had to be cancelled @entity45 , @entity57 and @entity69 have around 19 per cent between them , while @entity0 has 15 per cent			1
approximately 11 per cent is owned by fans with the likes of @entity73 , @entity74 and recent investor @entity75 holding another three per cent , which would give a total of around 48 per cent			2
@entity0 firmly believes he will gain sufficient further backing to cross the line and seize control at a meeting which will take place within the next six weeks			1
‘ the requisition consists of four resolutions for the removal of the incumbent board and three resolutions for the appointment to the board of myself , @entity10 and @entity25 , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ the resolutions do not seek to review the employment of the two executive directors presently on the board			0
they will merely be removed as directors			0
police and stewards hold people back as @entity32 and @entity3 fans attempt to confront each other ‘ i would not have called for a general meeting if i was not confident , from my review of the present shareholder register , that it will be supported by more than 50 per cent of the total registered shareholders			1
‘ while many of the shareholders hold differing views as to what is right for the club , i believe that a clear majority are like - minded on one key point — the need to remove the incumbent board and to replace it with individuals who can gain the trust of fans , sponsors and the shareholder community			0
’ @entity0 ’s own planned position on the board could be subject to scrutiny by the @entity124 given his previous issues with the tax authorities in @entity15 , although he has previously insisted he sees no issue in meeting ‘ fit and proper person ’ requirements			1
the @entity131 - born tycoon — who lost a £ 20m @entity3 investment made during sir @entity134 ’s tenure — would seek to expand the board if successful at the @entity5 , which could lead to representation from within the @entity45 consortium			2
@entity0 wants an in - depth study of the commercial contracts and pledged to pursue any instances where it is deemed they are not in the club ’s best interests			2
he would also seek a new nominated advisor ( @entity145 ) in the @entity146 to replace @entity147 as part of an overhaul			0
@entity3 went into administration in february 2012 and were later relegated to the @entity151 ‘ it is also desirable to partner a nomad that is willing to move forward and away from the recent poor governance at the club , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ i have already had initial discussions with potential @entity145 on the basis of two key conditions			0
firstly , that the resolutions at the @entity5 are passed			0
secondly , that the board is expanded as soon as possible thereafter to incorporate experienced independent non-executive directors such that the highest level of corporate governance is achieved and maintained			0
‘ that is exactly what all stakeholders should want to happen after experiencing so many years of different boards that have lurched from one crisis to another			0
in advance of the general meeting i will further engage with @entity145 willing to embrace the standards that we will set for the future and ensure that an appropriate arrangement is in place to be adopted immediately on conclusion of a successful vote at the @entity5			1
‘ the most pressing task for the incoming board will be to ensure the long - term financial sustainability of the club			0
a secondary important task will be to conduct a forensic audit of the management and commercial contracts undertaken over the last few years to determine whether they are truly arms length and whether the affairs of the company have been pursued in accordance with the fiduciary obligations of those entrusted with that responsibility			0
any malfeasance will be pursued aggressively and transparently .			0

@entity0 will call for the head of @entity17 at general meeting
