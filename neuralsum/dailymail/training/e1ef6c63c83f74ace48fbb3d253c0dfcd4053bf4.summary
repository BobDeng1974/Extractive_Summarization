after @entity3 made landfall over areas of @entity6 and @entity7 in 2012 , emergency response vehicles emblazoned with the logo of the @entity2 rolled in			1
according to one former field supervisor , dozens of those vehicles had no destination and no supplies , useless for anything but providing the appearance of disaster relief			2
a joint investigation by @entity16 and @entity17 showed that in spite of massive funding , relief efforts from the @entity2 were disastrous , forcing smaller organizations to step in			1
arrival : a @entity2 vehicle distributes foodstuffs in january 2013 to @entity26 victims in the @entity27 , months after critics blasted the organization , which raised over $ 300million during @entity26 , for failing to aid victims on the second anniversary of @entity26 , the report states in the aftermath of the hurricanes , aid distribution was ' politically driven ' and the @entity2 set aside resources for pr purposes			1
it also detailed the disastrous state of on - the - ground relief efforts , with volunteers wasting thousands of meals , and failing to track sex offenders or allowing them into children 's play spaces			1
@entity46 , 62 , worked coordinating food and aid distribution as a ' mass care chief ' for the @entity2 in both storms , and the empty trucks he saw deployed during @entity3 made him ' furious			1
' @entity46 , who served as a @entity53 nuclear officer during the @entity54 , detailed how one official dispatched 80 @entity2 vehicles with little to nothing in the way of food and supplies inside			2
volunteers were told ' to drive around and look like you ’re giving disaster relief ' to bolster the image of on - the - ground aid to a visiting group of @entity2 executives , said @entity46			1
before the storm hit , @entity46 had issues with coordinating relief efforts with upper - level planners that were either poorly informed or more concerned with optics			2
destruction : a resident wades through a @entity77 neighborhood where houses collapsed on themselves and roads became rivers chief executive : representative @entity82 talks with @entity2 ceo @entity83 , who is criticized for having an organization better suited for fundraising than relief abandoned : homes throughout the @entity88 were torn apart by the force of @entity26 , forcing families into shelters run by the @entity2 and other organizations in an email sent to @entity2 officials , he stated that ' 90 % of incoming @entity98 [ @entity97 ] staff were sent to @entity99 ( over 460 mass care workers ) , ' in spite of forecasts showing other areas of @entity104 would be harder hit			1
@entity46 now believes the motive was to give the organization significant visibility for the @entity109 , which was being held at the time in @entity110			0
his analysis of disaster relief provided in @entity7 was bleaker			0
there ' we were unable to open a single shelter with proper staff , materials and food resources prior to landfall , ' he emailed national headquarters			0
' we had trouble getting food to our kitchens			0
' he added that aid efforts were ' marked primarily by internal political wrangling , power struggles and ineffectiveness			0
' though the organization promised reforms , an even more destructive disaster would hit about two months after @entity3			2
two weeks after @entity26 made landfall , chief executive @entity83 described the @entity2 's performance as ' near flawless ' to @entity135			1
for @entity46 , who was again coordinating aid efforts , the problems of @entity3 had returned intensified in the wake of @entity26 's massive destruction			1
in early november , officials noticed that @entity141 , emergency response vehicles , both a symbol of @entity2 aid and a vital resource for disaster relief , were being diverted to press events			1
on november 2 , as lines for food and water snaked through the @entity27 , @entity46 noted 15 of @entity151 's active @entity150 were working events tied to public relations for the @entity2			1
@entity154 , another mass care chief , emailed a vice president to complain that ' i ca n’t afford to have my @entity158 sitting around all morning			0
' ' stop right there , ' came a response			0
' these are not your @entity150			0
they belong to @entity83 [ @entity83 ] and she ’s going to do whatever she wants with them			0
' the @entity2 said 15 @entity158 were delivering aid in @entity77 where @entity167 , @entity168 chief , was speaking , but that was ' not the reason that @entity158 were sent to @entity77			2
' debris : scenes like this one in @entity172 were replayed in numerous neighborhoods on the south shore of @entity175 and @entity176 after @entity26 struck photo op : @entity178 posed with boxes in one @entity2 erv leading one official to later grouse it took a ' @entity183 model five hours to unload one box off a truck ' in december , an @entity186 was tied up for a tour of storm - stricken areas of @entity176 with supermodel @entity178 , angering aid workers			1
' did you know it takes a @entity197 ’s @entity196 model five hours to unload one box off a truck ? ' an official who requested anonymity said			0
' i was so mad			0
' the @entity2 provided figures , saying it distributed 17 million meals and snacks , hosted 74,000 overnight stays at shelters and gave more than 7 million relief items like blankets and flashlights			1
a powerpoint presentation claimed , though , the ' sheer size ' of disaster relief areas left by @entity26 ' crippled our ability to count			1
' it also showed how unprepared the volunteer force actually was			0
at @entity216 shelters , ill - prepared volunteers ' did n’t know / follow procedures ' for handling of critical issues like sex offenders and infirm storm victims			1
the same @entity222 , titled ' lessons learned from @entity26 and @entity3 ' detailed volunteers sheltering sex offenders without tracking them or notifying police			1
' sex offenders were placed in a special place off of dorm , but they were n't there , they were all over , including playing in children 's area , ' the report detailed			1
after raising more than $ 300million in the wake of @entity26 , @entity2 shelters lacked proper cots to accommodate handicap storm victims , who instead ' slept in their wheelchairs for days			1
' @entity237 had been working in one community in the @entity27 for weeks when the @entity2 finally arrived			2
she said that a volunteer arrived at her emergency center only to beg for batteries from @entity242 , the group @entity237 volunteered for , to put in flashlights it planned to distribute			2
even where the @entity2 had supplies and funding , reporters found that excessive waste was being documented			2
in the face of news that @entity26 victims were going hungry , in early november @entity2 officials began pressuring coordinators in @entity151 to step up meal production			1
@entity46 , who was tracking meal delivery , estimated that 3 of every 10 meals produced was already being thrown away because volunteers were not finding those in need			0
the @entity2 overruled him , contracting a catering company to deliver 200,000 more meals per day over the 20,000 already being produced			0
the result , the day after the order was given , was a delivery of 70,000 danishes , half of which were discarded because volunteers were not given information about where hungry victims were			0
because the catering company was also unable to produce lunch or dinner that day , volunteers were left with cold pastries to hand out for the remaining meals			0
now , @entity46 states , after years of service , ' i do n’t donate to the @entity2			0
' as the @entity2 drew criticism in the early weeks after @entity26 , the organization did respond , but @entity46 said the changes were only to make it ' look the best to the local politicians			1
' one town remembers the @entity2 as being a permanent absence			0
@entity288 in @entity289 opened their @entity290 , where officials met at all hours of the day to coordinate disaster relief in the wake of the storm			0
when the center was activated , explained police lieutenant @entity297 , a chair was set aside for the @entity2			2
it remained vacant through the entirety of @entity26 response efforts			2
' they were the only major player not there , ' he said .			0
