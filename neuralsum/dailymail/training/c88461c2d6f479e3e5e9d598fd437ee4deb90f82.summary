a new pill is promising to make the wrinkle - smoothing effects of @entity3 injections last for 30 per cent longer			0
the @entity5 tablets are also said to help the cosmetic injections – which cost up to £ 400 – take effect faster			1
more than one million people in the @entity9 use the cosmetic jabs to combat wrinkles , but the downside is that the benefits last for just three months			0
@entity3 has become big business since its launch but one problem is the effects only last around three months , meaning regular trips to the clinic to maintain the wrinkle - free look the new pill appears to be little more than a vitamin supplement which contains a high dose of zinc combined with an enzyme called phytase which helps the body absorb zinc			1
it is being marketed to @entity3 fans at £ 45 for a pack of ten – significantly more than the price of a standard zinc supplement from high street stores , which costs about £ 8 for a pack of 100 tablets			1
however , @entity9 distributor @entity36 say the pill is unique and can reduce the price of @entity3 for regular users			0
@entity40 also claims just taking a cheaper zinc supplement bought from the high street will not have the same effect			1
a clinical trial of the pill , published in the @entity45 in @entity46 , found that 92 per cent of patients taking @entity5 reported @entity3 treatments lasted for several weeks longer than normal , and also helped the jab to take effect more quickly			1
cosmetic surgery experts in the @entity9 said the results were interesting but further research should be done			0
@entity3 , a tiny quantity of the toxin botulinum , is injected into human tissue – mainly in the face – and works by blocking nerve endings , which prevents electrical signals from moving through muscles			0
@entity61 capsules will be launched in @entity9 to help extend the effects of @entity3 by up to 30 per cent this has a ‘ freezing ’ effect that smooths out wrinkles and fine lines			1
@entity61 patients are told to take two 25mg pills a day for four days prior to having @entity3 and on the day they receive the jab			2
consultant plastic surgeon @entity71 , a member of the @entity72 , said : ‘ we do know that zinc is crucial in helping injured patients to recover , for example burns victims , so it ’s fundamental in repairing tissue			2
' that may well be influencing the action of the @entity3			0
but the pill is just a vitamin supplement and it may be that lots of people are just slightly zinc - deficient anyway			1
’ @entity5 does not have to be approved by the drugs watchdog , the @entity87 , because it is classed as a dietary supplement			0
patients do not need a prescription			0
there are warnings about taking too much zinc and more than 50mg a day can affect how well your immune system works			2
@entity5 involves taking 50mg a day for four days , but this is not thought to be prolonged enough to have a detrimental effect .			2

pills contain zinc and an enzyme called phytase which helps the vitamin to be absorbed
pack of ten costs £ 45 ; zinc supplements cost £ 8 for 100
