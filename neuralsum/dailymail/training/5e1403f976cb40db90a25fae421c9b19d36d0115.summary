shock : @entity5 's owner @entity25 returned to her home in @entity27 , @entity28 , to find @entity5 looking worse for wear , bumping into walls and struggling to walk yesterday ms day said : ' i had only gone out for an hour and a half , and when i got back i found the smashed bottle			1

the mischievous puppy managed to knock the bottle of liqueur off a table when her owner was out ' she had been sleeping , but then she tried to get up and just started banging into walls			1
she looked like a drunk person			0
' there was lager and coca - cola on the table outside too , but she obviously knew what she preferred			0
' i think she just wanted to enter into the festive spirit but she evidently did n't know her limits			0
' i had got home at about 4pm , and we were at the vets within the hour and thankfully we were able to deal with it in time			0
her owner @entity25 said : ' i think she probably just felt a bit left out because she had n't got her own @entity3 drink , but i will have to make sure i keep the bottles completely out of reach in future ' ' they flushed her out and put her on a drip			1
' she 's a big dog though			0

' emergency treatment : @entity5 was rushed to the @entity34 animal hospital in @entity35 , @entity28 ( above ) where vets put her on a drip to try to flush the alcohol out of her system @entity105 , a @entity106 , said : ' it is lucky @entity5 's owners came home and discovered what @entity5 had done so quickly , as alcohol is toxic to pets			1
' because @entity5 is almost fully grown and quite a big dog the damage is not as bad as it may have been with a smaller breed , which could have proved fatal			2
