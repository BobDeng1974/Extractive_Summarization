by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 @entity3 is facing a growing revolt over this leadership , after his poll lead over the @entity7 evaporated and four in 10 voters branded him ‘ weird ’			1
the @entity11 leader is under pressure from all sides in the party after a lacklustre response to the @entity16 and slumping to only one point above the conservatives in three different opinion polls			1
one mp called for mr @entity3 to stop ‘ just talking about the state ’ , while a group of left - wing think tanks urged him to explain what he would actually do if he became prime minister			1
some 41 per cent of voters think @entity3 is ' weird ' , compared to only 27 per cent who thought the same of @entity29 the @entity11 lead over the @entity18 has narrowed dramatically in recent days , and is down to just one point in three different polls , including this one from @entity33 for the @entity34 a string of mps and influential party thinkers say he needs ‘ bolder ’ ideas and can not try to coast to victory complaining about the cost of living			1
@entity43 told the @entity44 that his top team is split over whether to ‘ go big or go small ’ to woo voters over the next year			0
allies of policy chief @entity48 broke cover yesterday to demand he ‘ goes big ’ with a more radical set of policies			0
they believe general election coordinator @entity53 is encouraging mr @entity3 to be more cautious , in the belief that winning 35 per cent of the vote next year will be enough for victory			2
in further dispiriting news for the @entity11 chief , a survey revealed that voters think he is the ‘ weirdest ’ party leader in @entity61			1
the @entity33 poll for @entity63 showed that 41 per cent think mr @entity3 is either ‘ very weird ’ or ‘ somewhat weird ’			2
just 34 per cent thinks the same of @entity64 and only 27 per cent believe that @entity29 is weird			0
the survey , which looked at the public ’s perception of the leaders ’ personalities , also found 36 per cent of the population believe mr @entity3 would have been bullied at school			1
a third also think he would have been an unpopular student and 57 per cent said he would have been the hardest - working pupil			0
but the more pressing concern for @entity74 is that another @entity33 opinion poll put the @entity7 on 36 points , just one point behind @entity11 , while a @entity79 poll had the conservatives on 34 points – also only one point behind			1
more than half of under - 24s think mr @entity3 is weird , the @entity33 survey for @entity84 found a third of people suspect that mr @entity3 was bullied at school , and only 16 per cent thought he was popular yesterday a @entity91 poll put @entity11 on 35 per cent , again only one point ahead of the @entity7 on 34 per cent			1
mr @entity3 and shadow chancellor @entity92 are still trailing far behind the @entity18 when voters were asked which party they trust to run the economy			1
a senior @entity11 frontbencher said : ‘ our economic offering was already seen as weak by some voters			1
@entity3 ’s lame response has not helped with that			2
‘ some people seem to think that we can just coast to victory			0
this poll should be a wake - up call			0
’ and a member of the @entity43 described the ‘ pretty intense debate ’ with those wanting to think big calling for a ‘ distinctive , more radical platform for voters ’			0
he added : ‘ and if we win we will have a firmer platform to tackle the problems @entity3 has identified with predator capitalism			2
you can either have a mandate to do something interesting or you can try to creep over the line not offending anyone			0
’ responding to last week ’s @entity16 , mr @entity3 recycled several tired attacks on the @entity7 , accusing them of being ‘ out of touch ’ members of the ‘ @entity125 ’ with little idea of how normal people are affected by cuts			1
but a @entity11 mp said : ‘ people just do n’t take any notice of all the posh @entity130 boy attacks			2
they want to know what we are actually going to do			0
’ an alliance of think - tanks and left - wing intellectuals provided a fresh blow to the @entity11 leader , writing a joint letter to mr @entity3 questioning his sense of direction			1
labour leader @entity3 has faced criticism for his ' lame ' response to last week 's budget @entity3 is seen as the most honest leader , while @entity144 @entity64 is the least honest the 19 leading figures from groups such as @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 expressed unease that @entity11 ’s leader may not secure a mandate for the kind of reforms they believe @entity61 needs			1
they argued that @entity61 needs ‘ transformative ’ change , adding : ‘ if @entity11 plays the next election safe and hopes to win on the basis of @entity130 unpopularity , it will not have earned a mandate for such change			2
’ @entity163 , of the think - tank compass , said @entity11 needed to ‘ shape up , be bolder and more radical ’			2
@entity11 mp @entity164 warned mr @entity3 had to be ‘ much stronger ’ when communicating his message to voters			1
he told @entity168 ’s @entity167 : ‘ we have to talk less to ourselves and more to the wider public			0
‘ we 're sometimes seen as just talking about the public sector , just talking about the state			0
‘ i think we need to cut the soundbites and really talk more about small business , about entrepreneurialism , about people 's aspirations there , because ... the general election will be very much about the economy and as a party we need to get onto the front - foot talking about how we can support some small businesses , not least because they are the backbone of the return to the successful economy			0
’ another radical accused mr @entity3 of being on the back foot after @entity188 ’s plans to overhaul pensions			0
even an ally admitted that cost of living issues will not be enough to win a majority in 2015 as wages will begin to overtake prices later this year			0
@entity11 sought to downplay the polls , saying the @entity7 were ‘ always going to get a bounce out of the budget ’			0
a survey by @entity199 last night put @entity11 five points ahead of the @entity7 on 36 per cent , although the party ’s lead has shrunk by eight points			1
mr @entity3 faces a fresh headache this week when around 15 of his mps are expected to defy his instructions to vote for the government ’s welfare cap .			0

voters also think @entity3 was bullied and unpopular at school
crisis *mounts* after @entity16 *erodes* @entity11 lead over the conservatives
left wing think tanks urge @entity3 to explain what he would do as *pm*
