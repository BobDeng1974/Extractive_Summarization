by @entity0 ski on : @entity2 , 51 , is back on the slopes thanks to a new type of bespoke knee replacement created with the help of a 3d printer @entity8 skier @entity2 feared he might never hit the slopes again after an old injury to his left knee flared up again last june			1
even mowing the grass became painful and doing any exercise made it swollen , painful and unable to withstand pressure			2
he was forced to abandon his favourite pastimes of skiing and cycling			0
yet thanks to a new type of bespoke knee replacement created with the help of a 3d printer , the 51 - year - old company director was back in his skis by december			1
‘ i had no pain whatsoever , even though i was on the slopes at @entity26 , in @entity27 , for up to seven hours a day and skiing is renowned for putting pressure on knees , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ my new knee is remarkable and i feel so lucky to have the new implant			1
’ @entity2 has been fitted with a bespoke implant made by @entity35 company @entity34 which uses the latest in 3d technology			1
the company says the implant makes recovery faster , there is less bone and tissue removed during surgery and knee function may turn out to be as good as new			2
consultant orthopaedic surgeon @entity44 of @entity45 , @entity46 , who fitted @entity2 ’s knee , says : ‘ this is a huge advance – a bespoke knee replacement is like having a suit fitted and adjusted rather than buying a standard size over the internet			1
all knees are completely different			0
’ knee problems like @entity2 ’s develop because of cartilage wearing away			1
cartilage covers each end of the bones in the knee – the femur ( thigh bone ) , patella ( knee cap ) and tibia ( shin bone ) – allowing the joint to glide smoothly			2
when it wears away the bones are exposed and rub against each other			0
this causes pain , stiffness and swelling , and severely affects quality of life			0
there are around 85,000 knee replacement operations in the @entity78 every year			1
a total replacement involves the worn part of all three bones being replaced with metal and plastic implants while a partial replacement replaces just one part			2
mr @entity44 last year performed five partial knee replacements using the @entity34 option , along with about 120 standard replacements			2
the new bespoke replacement has been available in @entity90 for four years , and mr @entity44 trained for the surgery there			2
the procedure is offered in the @entity78 at a few private hospitals , with limited @entity95 availability			0
the @entity34 implant requires the removal of only up to 7mm of bone , compared to up to 12mm for a standard implant			0
@entity2 ’ s implant is known as the @entity101 and replaced his tibia			1
‘ you could see on scans that there was no cartilage left and the bones were touching , ’ says mr @entity44			0
for the procedure , the patient first has a ct scan to produce a 3d image of the knee			1
the design of the replacement joint is based on what engineers see on this scan			2
next a mould is made to this specific design , using 3d printing technology			1
from this mould the engineers construct the bespoke implant using a plastic called polyethylene and a metal alloy known as cobalt chrome , hard - wearing materials that should last 15 years			1
these components exactly replicate the shape of the patient ’s knee			1
the 3d engineers also print out @entity134 – small bespoke plastic instruments – that slot on to the knee and show exactly where the bone has to be cut , improving accuracy and meaning fewer cuts are needed			1
the implant is fitted during an hour - long operation under general anaesthetic			2
the surgeon first makes a two to three inchlong incision into the inside of the knee cap and exposes the knee bones			0
damaged cartilage is removed and small cuts are made into the bones			0
the parts of the replacement joint are inserted and fixed with bone cement			0
@entity2 had suffered from knee pain since his mid- 30s			1
he says : ‘ i went through years of pain and operations – i was on four types of pain relief a day			0
‘ by the time i had the replacement , i could n’t even mow the grass because any weight bearing was agony			0
i love skiing , sailing and running so found the situation incredibly frustrating			0
’ he is thrilled with the results of his surgery , saying : ‘ next day i was able to put weight on my leg and two days later i was in the hospital swimming pool with a physiotherapist			0
i occasionally have discomfort but that ’s unsurprising considering i ’ve had about ten operations altogether			0
‘ i ’m just so happy that i finally found one that worked – and worked brilliantly			0

@entity2 , 51 , has been fitted with a bespoke knee replacement
after a ct scan , a mould is made using 3d printing technology
