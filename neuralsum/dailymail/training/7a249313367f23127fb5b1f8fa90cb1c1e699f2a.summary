by @entity0 elite consultants earning up to £ 3,000 a day are being employed by the government at the taxpayers ' expense , it was revealed today			1
new figures have revealed that at least 30 of these highly - paid specialists were given work by six different @entity10 departments last year			1
ten were taken on by the @entity11 , eight worked at the @entity12 , five at the @entity13 , four at the @entity14 , two at the @entity15 and one at the @entity17			2
all earned between £ 1,000 and £ 2,000 a day			1
the @entity17 has admitted it was recently paying a consultant £ 3,000 - a - day - which equates to an annual salary of more than £ 1million			1
high price : departments on @entity10 ( pictured ) spent £ 317m on consultants last year with the @entity17 paying £ 3,000 a day the government told the @entity24 it paid £ 317 million to consultants in 2013 , but insisted overall spending on them had dropped by three quarters since 2009			1
separate figures show the @entity17 spent £ 137 million on technical consultants over the same period above and beyond that total , @entity29 said			2
it also told the programme it had recently employed someone earning up to £ 3,000 a day			1
the figures , obtained via a @entity38 request , prompted a backlash from campaigners and unions who questioned the high fees and urged ministers to set out in detail how many people were being hired and for how long			0
transport 10 justice 8 energy 5 @entity14 4 @entity15 2 defence 1 @entity49 , chief executive of the @entity50 , said : ' i think people will be extremely concerned about the number of consultants being paid vast amounts of money for a day 's work in government			1
' @entity23 is rightly reducing the headcount of the civil service but you can not negate that by paying huge amounts to consultants instead			2
' i think there are big questions about whether we are getting value for money not least because there is a severe lack of transparency about what they are actually doing			0
' @entity74 , deputy general secretary of @entity75 , the union which represents professionals across the civil service , said there was confusion about how the government did its sums			2
he said cuts in @entity10 had led to departments hiring a ' growing ' number of consultants and managers			0
' this is taxpayers ' money and they have a right to know how it is being spent , ' he added			0
' we know how much the prime minister earns , we know how much senior civil servants and other politicians earn , we have little or no idea how much individual consultants are earning			0
' the government would not give @entity29 details about the number of consultants earning more than £ 1,000 a day , but it said it had brought this kind of spending under control			1
a spokesman said : ' this government has scrutinised spend by departments like never before			0
already it has put an end to excessive spending on consultants and interim staff by establishing stringent controls			0
' certain departments do however have a requirement for specialist roles , especially where they are undertaking complex transformative projects			0
such roles are only authorised where the skills are not readily available within the civil service			0

30 consultants were paid between £ 1,000 and £ 2,000 a day last year
the @entity17 has said it paid one £ 3,000 a day for specialist work
