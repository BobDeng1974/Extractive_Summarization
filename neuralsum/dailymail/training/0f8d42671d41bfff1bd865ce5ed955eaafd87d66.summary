a ' degrading and dangerous ' @entity1 page which invites followers to name and shame women and their sexual behaviour has caused an uproar after gaining more than 10,000 likes in just a few weeks			1
the page , called ' @entity9 ' because it refers to women in the capital of the @entity12 of @entity13 , was set up three weeks ago and asks followers to send in pictures of ' easy girls ' and to write short descriptions about them			1
now it has been flooded with thousands of ' likes ' and hundreds of photos showing scantily - clad local women			2
pictures that were uploaded to the @entity1 page show two women posing for selfies photos posted on the page are often accompanied by comments speculating on the women 's sexual exploits the identities of the women pictured on the @entity1 page are not concealed like they are in these images typical comments include things such as : ' she lost her virginity when she was 13 and has slept with half of @entity13			1
she 's a real slut			0
' although it does n't give the women 's real names , there is no attempt to hide their faces so identifying who they are is easy to those who know them			0
critics have now slammed the page saying it is damaging to the women 's reputations and to their safety			2
@entity1 commentator @entity54 wrote on the page : ' can you prove that the things about the girls posted on this page are true ? ' i do n't think you realise what harm this can brings to those accused			2
' and women 's rights campaigner @entity64 also waded into the debate , calling the site ' abhorrent '			0

' a local police spokesman said : ' we are looking into the matter and if there is a clear case of defamation or breach of privacy we will take action			0
