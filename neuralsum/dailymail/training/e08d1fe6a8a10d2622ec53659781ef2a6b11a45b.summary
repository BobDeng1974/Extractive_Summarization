by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 was last night embroiled in an extraordinary race row after allegedly calling a top chef a ‘ f * * * * * * black b * * * * * * ’			1
the stunning claim was made by @entity9 - born @entity8 in his new memoir yes , chef , published in @entity12			1
in his book @entity8 , who has cooked for president @entity13 at the @entity14 , alleged @entity2 rang him shortly after he arrived as a guest chef at @entity19 ’s five - star @entity17 in 2000			1
accusation : @entity20 - born chef @entity8 , left , claims @entity2 , right , called him a ' f * * * * * * black b * * * * * * ' during a telephone call while the pair were at the @entity17 in 2000 accused : @entity2 last night became embroiled in an extraordinary race row after allegedly calling a top chef a ‘ f * * * * * * black b * * * * * * ’ he claims @entity2 was angry that @entity8 had not named him when he was asked which chefs he admired			1
‘ on my second day i was cooking when a phone call came into the kitchen			0
the executive chef answered and with a puzzled look handed me the receiver			2
’ @entity8 , 42 , said he thought it was a call from a friend in @entity37 , but added : ‘ instead , there was screaming			2
“ how the f * * * can you come to my f * * * * * * city and think you are going to be able to cook without even f * * * * * * referring to me ? ” ‘ this went on for what seemed like five minutes			0
“ i ’m going to make sure you have a f * * * * * * miserable time here			0
this is my city , you hear ? good luck , you f * * * * * * black b * * * * * *			0
” then he hung up			0
‘ to be honest , though , only one phrase in his juvenile tirade unsettled me : when he called me a black b * * * * * *			0
actually , i did n’t give a f * * * about the b * * * * * * part			0
but the black part p * * * * * me off			0
’ the uncorroborated claim was strenuously denied by a furious @entity2 , who called it ‘ a complete fabrication ’ , although @entity8 – whose book was vetted by lawyers for publisher @entity61 – stuck by his story			1
reputation : @entity2 has a reputation for displaying an aggressive style in the kitchen , but he vehemently denies the claims made by @entity8 in his new book yes , chef @entity2 ’s spokesman said : ‘ we ’re shocked by these completely false and extremely offensive accusations			1
@entity2 has always had an amicable relationship with mr @entity8 , even suggesting him as a fellow judge when @entity76 started in the @entity12 two years ago			1
this was an offer mr @entity8 readily entertained , travelling to @entity79 twice to audition alongside @entity2 , hours of which are captured on video , so we are understandably baffled as to why he would make these statements as well as publicly claim in a recent interview that their paths “ have n’t crossed ” since the alleged call			1
‘ we can only think this bizarre denial and these malicious comments have been made in order to garner publicity for mr @entity8 ’s book and therefore we will pursue such actions as we deem appropriate against mr @entity8 and his publishers			2
’ @entity8 refused to comment last week but a spokesman , who said they worked on behalf of publisher @entity61 , said : ‘ mr @entity8 stands by his statement regarding mr @entity2 and has no further comment			2
’ meeting : @entity2 says he paid to fly @entity8 to @entity79 in february 2010 so he could audition for the @entity12 version of @entity76 , pictured a source familiar with the case said : ‘ @entity2 is boiling mad			1
you can accuse him of many things but not of being a racist			0
he has worked with , and created hundreds of jobs for people of all races , creeds and colours			0
he will fight all the way to clear his name			0
’ @entity8 ’s book explains why he failed to acknowledge @entity2 when asked which @entity111 chefs he admired			1
he writes : ‘ i had cooked with @entity2 once , a couple of years earlier , when we did a promotion in @entity114			0
there were a handful of chefs there			0
and @entity2 was rude and obnoxious to all of them			0
‘ so when i was giving interviews in the lead - up to the @entity17 event and was asked who inspired me , i thought the best way to handle it was to say nothing about him at all			2
i guess he was offended at being left out			0
’ he claims to have snubbed @entity2 since the alleged phone call			1
but @entity2 , 45 , says that in february 2010 @entity8 was happy to fly from his @entity37 home to @entity79 – at @entity2 ’s expense – to audition for @entity12 @entity76			1
footage of those auditions shows a relaxed @entity8 chatting happily with @entity2 and joking for the cameras , although he failed to win the judging spot			2
and @entity8 ’s claims about the phone call were disputed by the person he says handed him the @entity17 phone , the hotel ’s executive chef @entity137			1
asked if he recalled @entity2 ’s call or if @entity8 complained about racist comments , mr @entity137 said : ‘ i do n’t remember that at all			1
i remember @entity8 but i do n’t remember him speaking to @entity2			2
i do n’t remember handing the phone to @entity8 and saying , “ this is @entity2 , ” no. ’			2
