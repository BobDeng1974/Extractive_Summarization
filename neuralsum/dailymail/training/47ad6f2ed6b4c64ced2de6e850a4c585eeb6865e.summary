by @entity0 gun owners in @entity2 are now free to take weapons into churches , bars , libraries , schools and airports thanks to a new law relaxing gun control rules			1
new legislation , which came into effect yesterday , means that the 500,000 @entity13 with a gun licence will be allowed to to enter the public buildings with their weapons openly displayed			1
critics described the bill as a ' guns everywhere ' law and say it is the most extreme in the @entity22 and could lead to more violent crime			2
new law : the sweeping legislation was signed into law in april by @entity13 governor @entity27 , centre opposition : critics , who call the legislation a ' guns everywhere ' law , protested against it but did not stop gun activists securing the dramatic expansion in the number of places they can freely bear arms gun enthusiasts have hailed the legislation , named the @entity43 , as a triumph of their constitutional right to bear arms			1
bars and ' unsecured ' government buildings , such as libraries , will be expected to allow gun carriers in by default , while other locations , such as churches , will need to opt in before guns are freely allowed on site			1
airports are also covered by the legislation , although guns will continue to be banned in restricted areas and will not be allowed on flights			0
jubilant gun owners celebrating at a shooting range in @entity63 yesterday said the new law vindicates rights ' given to us by @entity67 '			1
one activist told @entity69 : ' it 's a victory for the second amendment rights ... the right to keep and bear arms			0
' another said : ' those rights are protected by the constitution and are given to us by @entity67 '			0
the law faced heavy opposition while moving through the state 's senate			2
controversial clauses allowing guns to be carried on university campuses were struck out while the law was being drawn up			0
some surveys showed that a majority of @entity13 opposed the law , but lawmakers in the state had the powerful gun lobby to contend with , which piles pressure on legislators to support the rights on gun owners			2
the loosening of laws in @entity2 could lead to the same happening in other states , while @entity99 , @entity101 @entity100 have recently passed their own laws			0
' idiotic ' : critics fear that the new gun laws will lead to a rise in violent crime triumphant : gun activists say it is their right to carry weapons where they like , and deny a link to violence when the signing - in took place in april , @entity116 , the founder of pressure group the @entity118 , told @entity119 : ' you will see other states start to adopt this concept and it will spread across @entity124 '			1
on social media , the law was roundly condemned , though some activists defended the rules			0
briton @entity129 tweeted : ' the " guns everywhere " legislation in @entity2 is the most idiotic law ever			0
having a gun wo n't make you safe because everyone else has one ! ' @entity135 added : ' @entity124 , after more mass shootings earlier this year ? really ? ! you 'll never learn , will you ? ' @entity137 , a gun activist from the @entity22 , tweeted : ' @entity2 gun law set to take effect and @entity140 say : the sky is falling , as usual , no facts just faux hysteria			2

@entity43 came into force in the @entity22 state yesterday
gun owners can now openly carry weapons in even more public places
bars and some government buildings will be open to gun carriers by default
churches can ' opt in ' to allow guns - but campuses remain banned
critics fear *increased* violence from state 's 500,000 licensed gun owners
