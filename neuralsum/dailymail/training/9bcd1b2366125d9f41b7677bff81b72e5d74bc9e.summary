around £ 150million a year is to be ploughed into primary schools to boost sports provision and help develop the @entity4 stars of the future , @entity0 said yesterday			1
the move follows criticism that the @entity8 was neglecting school sports by imposing cuts			1
just after the 2010 election , education secretary @entity11 provoked an outcry by abolishing £ 162million of ring - fenced funding for the @entity15			0
investing in the future : ministers are set to announce up to £ 150 million of extra funding to help primary schools improve their sports now mr @entity0 has vowed to get sport for children back on track			1
every school will receive a lump sum proportionate to the number of pupils			0
a primary school with 250 pupils would receive £ 9,250 per year			0
this is the equivalent of around two days a week of a primary teacher or a coach ’s time – enough to make sure every pupil in the school can do sport with a specialist			1
the funding will be ‘ ring - fenced ’ , meaning it can only to be spent on sport			0
heads will decide what is best for their children ’s needs , from specialist coaching and teacher training to after - school or weekend events			1
the prime minister said : ‘ the @entity49 and @entity50 marked an incredible year for this country and i will always be proud that we showed the world what @entity54 can do			1
‘ i want to ensure the @entity50 count for the future too and that means capitalising on the inspiration young people took from what they saw during those summer months			2
keeping the legacy alive : the move comes after calls for more investment in school sports to help build upon the legacy of the @entity4 and @entity50 ‘ with this new approach to sport , we can create a culture in our schools that encourages all children to be active and enjoy sport , and helps foster the aspirations of future @entity75 and @entity50			1
‘ whether that is the future @entity78 , @entity79 or @entity80 , or someone who will simply learn to love sport and exercise for a lifetime , this investment will benefit a whole generation of children for many years to come			1
’ other changes include tougher assessment of sport provision via @entity89 to ensure the funding is bringing the maximum benefit for all pupils , with schools held to account for how they spend the money			2
and teacher training will be overhauled to produce a cadre of primary teachers with a particular specialism in @entity100			0
this is being developed in conjunction with sporting bodies and will start with a pilot covering 120 primary teachers , with the first of these beginning work in schools in september 2013			0
the announcement was welcomed by sports and education groups , and leading figures in the world of sport			2
the prime minister ’s @entity49 and @entity115 , who organised the successful @entity4 , said : ‘ when i stood up in @entity117 in 2005 i spoke of @entity119 ’s vision to connect young people with the inspirational power of the @entity50 so they are inspired to choose sport			1
‘ today ’s announcement does just that and by focussing on primary schools we have the opportunity to use sport and physical activity to shape the daily lives of young people			0
i am particularly pleased with the proposals around initial teacher training and continual professional development because i know from my own experience what an impact teachers and their engagement can have on the lives of young people			0
’ @entity80 , who one two golds at the @entity4 , said : ‘ it is great to see a commitment to funding school sport and that it is something i passionately believe in			1
‘ i am very excited to know that lots of children will be able to get involved in sport while at school and get more help from teachers and coaches			2
it really is very important			0
’ @entity78 , another @entity49 gold medallist , said : ‘ it is great to see initiatives that help to give really young children the chance to take part in sport			2
‘ this latest funding for primary schools sounds fantastic – so many of them have no funds for @entity100 and hopefully now whether in an inner city or small rural community young kids will be introduced to fun ways to be active that will spark an interest in taking part in sport as they grow up			0

money will help children to have weekly access to specialist sports teaching
move comes after calls for more investment in school sport to help build on @entity54 *'s* success at the @entity4 and @entity50
