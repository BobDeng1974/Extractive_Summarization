@entity126 , defending @entity22 , said : ' she found herself dealing with mr @entity10 's failing health from cancer as well as his failing business interests			1
' through his relationship with her , he was able to lead a life that would otherwise not have been available to him			0

he was a strong man , and did n't put up with nonsense			0

two examples of mr @entity10 's signature ( left , and centre ) , with the one used on the forged will ( right ) a friend of @entity183 spotted an old red telephone box for sale on @entity7 , and suspected it might have belonged to his father ' i feel my father was duped			1
the court case only heard @entity8 's side of the story			2
the truth is , my father was a successful businessman			2
' he and @entity8 ran the business together and made a lot of money			2
they bought a beautiful £ 700,000 house with jacuzzi rooms and @entity77 - style tiles			0
the also went on lavish holidays together and enjoyed the good life			0
when my dad died i believed that his estate would come to his children but @entity8 took the lot			2
' at first she told us there was no will and then she said there was one but it was obviously a fake			2
it left all his possessions , including the house and business , to her			2
' it just did n't ring true and when we got the signature analysed it was proved to be a forgery			2
mr @entity10 's son @entity110 ( pictured ) said his father would be ' turning in his grave ' @entity110 , pictured with his father in 2009 , said he thought mr @entity10 's estate would go to his children mr @entity10 pictured in 2009 with his daughter @entity112			1

the family 's suspicions were confirmed when they spotted their father 's belongings being sold on the internet			1
mr @entity10 , an engineer and father - of - one , added : ' a friend of mine told me he saw an old red telephone box for sale on @entity7 and thought it looked familiar			1

' i started seeing lovely dining tables , lawn mowers and dj equipment which my dad owned also being sold			0
' @entity8 was basically stripping the house of my father 's valuables just weeks after he died			1
i could n't believe it and we called the police			0
' my nan in her 80s has been traumatised and the whole family ca n't believe it			0
it 's like a story out of a soap			0
speaking after the hearing , mr @entity10 's son @entity110 , 35 , from @entity162 , said he believed his father ( pictured ) had been the victim of an elaborate con the court heard mr @entity10 ( right ) , from @entity34 , ran a car refurbishment business when he met @entity22 ( left ) in 2003 following her ' acrimonious divorce ' from husband @entity23 ' @entity8 has shown no remorse			1
effectively she has done the opposite			0
she said to me by text once that i should ' grow up and respect my father 's wishes			2
' ' she emotionally tried to control me and says things like my father never loved us and he was n't happy with us			0
what a way to lose my father , with the thoughts she put in my head like that			0
' so in all we ended up with a @entity147 , a @entity148 and some jewellery			0
effectively it amounts to little between the three of us , perhaps a few thousand pounds each			0
' the sentence is not an issue to me really , maybe we , the family , wanted her to be in jail			0
