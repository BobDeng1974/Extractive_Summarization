the wolf - whistles and shouts of appreciation were not just for the models ’ feminine curves ; they are also for the breathtaking courage of the leggy , high cheeked sirens , who in flaunting their bodies made an unequivocal statement that they are proud to be transvestites and transsexuals			0
all were born as men			0
but that was n't the most controversial aspect of monday night 's miss @entity33 2013 contest			1
the prize ran into controversy because a sex change operation is against the law in @entity33			1
instead of withdrawing the prize as they were instructed to do , the organisers dodged the problem			1
' we did not directly offer transgender surgery as a prize			2
we presented the award as a gift voucher with the option for the winner to do what they want with the money in @entity49			1
leggy : for the first time , the organisers of the event are offering the winner a transsexual operation from male to female in @entity49 ' it will be entirely up to them , ' says the president of @entity42 , @entity74 , carefully choosing her words speaking to the @entity76			1
it means , the victor can either undergo a sex change or have the best cosmetic facial and plastic surgery in the @entity83 country			1
the prize was worth £ 4,000 with a year of counseling if they choose the sex operation			1

the show is sponsored by the government ’s @entity120 and @entity122 as part of the campaign to combat homophobic violence in the country			0
@entity74 , a 38 - year - old , transvestite , is one of the driving forces in the country fighting to change society ’s negative attitudes towards those who wish to live their lives as cross-dressers or as transgender women			2
' the beauty constant is essentially a political tool for us to draw attention to a section of the population that faces prejudice and is marginalised in @entity6 society on a daily basis , ' explains @entity74			0
the victor can either undergo a sex change or have the best cosmetic facial and plastic surgery in the @entity83 country ' there are still a lot of transvestites and transsexuals who suffer discrimination by being refused for a job , by not being able to use the name they choose for themselves , and by being the subject of homophobic violence and abuse , ' said @entity74 with a hint of anger in her voice			1
behind the @entity165 's glamorous celebration is a dark underbelly of homophobic violence in @entity33 with the alarming statistic of 1,341 homosexuals murdered ( @entity170 – @entity171 , gay , bisexual and transgender ) in the country between 2007 and december 2012 , according to records held by @entity175 ( @entity175 ) , the oldest organisation of its kind in the country			1

flaunting it : the show is sponsored by the government 's @entity120 and @entity122 as part of the campaign to combat homophobic violence in the country most of the candidates have jobs working in the beauty industry , as models and make - up artists			0
but it would be wrong to conclude the competitors are only restricted to this area of employment			0
sharing the catwalk are saleswomen , video editors , a psychologist and students			0
the crown of miss @entity33 2013 was won by @entity210 , a stunning 21 - year - old hairdresser from @entity212 who tells the @entity76 that from an early age she only ever played with dolls and at 17 she challenged the taboos in her school by dressing as a woman			1
they just stopped and starred			0
but i decided that this was what i wanted to do and no one was going to change my mind			2
' there was a bit of teasing , but because i was very confident , it did n’t affect me and they soon gave up out of boredom , ' said the 5ft 8in tall transvestite			0
