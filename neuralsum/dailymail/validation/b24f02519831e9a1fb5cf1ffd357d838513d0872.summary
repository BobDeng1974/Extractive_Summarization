the pilots of the @entity2 plane that skidded off a runway at @entity4 last week during a snowstorm have told investigators that automatic systems designed to slow down the plane were not working properly			1
they said the plane 's automatic brakes were set to ' max , ' but they did not sense any deceleration as the aircraft veered toward @entity14 , according to the @entity15			1
the flight crew also said the runway appeared ' all white ' - covered in snow - when they broke out of the overcast sky and glimpsed it just moments before landing			2
the captain also reported he was unable to prevent the airplane from drifting to the left			0
investigators said the plane was flying on autopilot until it was 230 feet off the ground , indicating a fairly routine landing until the very end			0
@entity47 from @entity48 was carrying 127 passengers , including two lap children , plus five crew members , when it slid off the runway thursday and skidded about 2,000 feet along a normally grassy area alongside the runway that was covered in snow			1
close call : the flight crew also said the runway appeared ' all white ' - covered in snow - when they broke out of the overcast sky and glimpsed it just moments before landing			0
the nose of the plane ended up over the water for the last 940 of those feet , the plane 's left wing was cutting through and destroying the airport 's chain - link perimeter fence , investigators said			1
the aircraft came to rest with its nose leaning perilously on a berm that separates the runway from icy @entity14			1
the plane suffered damage to the left wing , including a punctured fuel tank that caused a leak			2
the belly of the aircraft from the nose to the first passenger door and the nose itself also were damaged , investigators said			2
since @entity2 took ownership of the md - 88 plane on dec. 30 , 1987 , it had taken off and landed 54,865 times , investigators said			0
spread out over the past 28 years , that means the plane flew an average of 5.5 flights a day			0
the @entity99 was a workhorse of @entity102 domestic airlines for the past three decades , favored on short , frequent routes			0
this particular one had logged more than 71,000 hours - or nearly 3,000 full days - in the air			0
investigators are also examining an identical md - 88 plane that landed at @entity4 minutes before the botched landing as a baseline for evaluating the data from @entity111			0
veered : the aircraft came to rest with its nose leaning perilously on a berm that separates the runway from icy @entity14			1
the flight from @entity48 was carrying 127 passengers at the time			1

pilots told the @entity122 brakes were set to ' max '

first officer apparently had to deploy automatic spoilers himself
veered off towards @entity14 with its nose *hanging* over the water
