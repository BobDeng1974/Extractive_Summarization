scientists have revealed that @entity1 came perilously close to a solar storm that could have ' changed life as we know it ' , causing widespread power failures and knocking out gps and communication networks			1
on july 23 , 2012 , a plasma cloud or ' @entity9 ' rocketed away from the sun as fast as 3000 km / s , more than four times faster than a typical eruption			1
had the eruption occurred just one week earlier , the blast site would have been facing @entity1 , rather than off to the side			1
according to a study by the @entity24 , the total economic impact could exceed $ 2 trillion or 20 times greater than the costs of a @entity26			1
multi-ton transformers fried by such a storm could take years to repair and impact national security			2
analysts believe that a direct hit could cause widespread power blackouts , disabling everything that plugs into a wall socket			1
most people would n’t even be able to flush their toilet because urban water supplies largely rely on electric pumps , one report warned			0
solar flares can temporarily alter the upper atmosphere creating disruptions with signal transmission from , for example , a gps satellite to @entity1			1
another phenomenon produced by the sun could be even more disruptive			2
known as a coronal mass ejection or @entity9 these solar explosions propel bursts of particles into @entity1 's atmosphere			1
those fluctuations could induce electric fluctuations at ground level that could blow out transformers in power grids			2
a cme 's particles can also collide with crucial electronics onboard a satellite and disrupt its systems			0
scientists say the eruption may have been the most violent ever recorded			2

' if it had hit , we would still be picking up the pieces , ' says @entity77 of the @entity78 , who presented a talk entitled @entity80 in july 2012 : defining @entity81 at the @entity83 's @entity82 - an annual gathering to discuss the perils and probabilities of solar storms			1
' we need to be prepared , ' said @entity77			0
a recent paper in @entity89 authored by @entity91 space physicist @entity90 and former postdoc @entity92 uncovered what gave the storm its potency			0
for one thing , the @entity9 was actually two @entity97 separated by only 10 to 15 minutes			1
this double storm cloud traveled through a region of space that had been cleared out by another cme only four days earlier			1
as a result , the @entity101 were not decelerated as much as usual by their transit through the interplanetary medium			0
on july 23 , 2012 , a plasma cloud or ' @entity9 ' rocketed away from the sun as fast as 3000 km / s , more than four times faster than a typical eruption			1
the storm tore through @entity1 orbit , but fortunately @entity1 was n't there			1
instead it hit the @entity113 spacecraft			2
researchers have been analyzing the data ever since , and they have concluded that the storm was one of the strongest in recorded history			0
' it might have been stronger than the @entity120 itself , ' says @entity77			0
the @entity120 of sept. 1859 was a series of powerful @entity101 that hit @entity1 head - on , sparking northern lights as far south as @entity126			1
intense geomagnetic storms caused global telegraph lines to spark , setting fire to some telegraph offices and disabling the ' @entity131			0
" a similar storm today could have a catastrophic effect on modern power grids and telecommunication networks			0
according to a study by the @entity24 , the total economic impact could exceed $ 2 trillion or 20 times greater than the costs of a @entity26			1
multi-ton transformers fried by such a storm could take years to repair and impact national security			0
when the @entity120 enveloped @entity1 in the 19th century , technologies of the day were hardly sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances			2
modern society , on the other hand , is deeply dependent on sun - sensitive technologies such as gps , satellite communications and the internet			0
' the effect of such a storm on our modern technologies would be tremendous , ' says @entity90			0
during informal discussions at the workshop , @entity155 of the @entity156 noted that ' without @entity161 's stereo probes , we might never have known the severity of the 2012 superstorm			0
' this shows the value of having ' space weather buoys ' located all around the sun. ' it also highlights the potency of the sun even during so - called ' quiet times			2
' many observers have noted that the current solar cycle is weak , perhaps the weakest in 100 years			0
clearly , even a weak solar cycle can produce a very strong storm			0
