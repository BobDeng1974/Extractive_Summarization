by @entity0 published : 13:00 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 19:00 est , 16 january 2014 they recently gave a candid interview to @entity4 where they denied reports they had been ' damaged ' by the family reality show and described themselves as ' better than ever			1
' but @entity10 's twins @entity8 and @entity11 were strangely tongue tied during a live interview on @entity14 on thursday			1
while being quizzed by host @entity16 on whether they had anything to say about ' how your family are doing ' , the 13 - year - old girls awkwardly looked at each other and their mother and failed to say a single word			1
' it 's your chance ... spit it out , ' @entity10 demanded , clearly hoping her daughters would back up the comments they made in people			1
' this is their chance and this is the most wordless i 've heard them all morning , ' she said , by way of explanation			1
the twins , whose father is @entity44 , did n't take the bait which clearly annoyed their mother			1
' i do n't want to speak for them but @entity8 go ahead - sort of the things that you said in the magazine , ' declared @entity10			1
' that years later - they 're good , they 're fine			1
' ' no , you just said it , ' @entity53 said stubbornly			1
@entity56 tied : @entity10 tried to smile through the awkward moment as @entity8 clammed up i do n't want to speak for them : @entity10 had to step in to give her twins thoughts on the situation ' i said it , ' @entity10 said , smiling through gritted teeth			1
' they get really frustrated that people assume certain things in our house and they always say , " but that ’s not how it is , mommy			1
why do they say that about us ? " @entity16 tried a different tack , asking the twins if people have the ' wrong impression ' of their family			1
' i would n't say the wrong impression but not like the full story , ' said @entity8 , who shot to fame along with her twin and @entity10 's nine - year - old sextuplets @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , and @entity89 in @entity92 reality show @entity90 , which first aired on @entity93 in 2007			1
' a lot of people think that filming our show has damaged us , but it ’s only really helped			1
' speechless : @entity11 did n't speak once during the awkward live television interview no spotlight for me : @entity8 seemed reluctant to address rumours about their family thursday 's interview appears to be part of @entity10 's campaign to address what she sees as ' inaccurate reporting ' about the family and recent comments made by her ex husband @entity90			1
back in the day : @entity10 and @entity44 in happier times back in 2009 ' they 're more aware of what is out there , the inaccuracies , things that are said by the general public , their father , whoever , because their friends talk about it at school , ' she told @entity16			1
' so , i sort of am forced to kind of inform them			1
we talk about it a lot			1
' she refuted @entity16 's suggestion that bringing the girls on national tv could ' put them on the spot ' and ' continue the injury to them			2
' ' there is no injury to begin with , ' said @entity10			2
' i ca n't get them to do anything they do n't want to do as with any parent			2
it 's not like i force them to do it			2
this was like " hey , @entity14 asked us if we wanted to do this , and how did we feel about it "			2
' and they agreed to it , as with my nine year olds			2
it 's a family decision so i think it 's really frustrating when there 's so much out there that 's not true			2
' in an attempt to try to explain the twins ' silence was nothing to do with any ' damage ' , @entity10 attempted to get them to weigh in to the debate			2
' i 'm getting to the point where i 'm extremely frustrated and i do n't spend time worrying about it because i 'm busy raising my kids , ' she said			2
' and we know the truth and that 's why they 're here even though they 're tongue tied this morning , to say hey we 're okay and doing well			2
would that be accurate girls to say ? ' @entity11 and @entity8 muttered an unenthusiastic ' yes ' to their mother 's question but perked up when @entity16 quizzed them on whether they had enjoyed being a part of the reality tv show			2
back to reality ? the twins lit up when asked if they would like to return to reality tv ' go for it - yes or no , ' urged @entity10 , 38			2
' yes - it was really fun and i really do miss it , ' said a smiling @entity8			2
' and you do , too , @entity11			0
@entity11 does , she 's just not gon na say it			0
' ' there 's a lot of fun opportunities , ' added @entity10			0
' if it happens it does and if it does n't , it does n't and it 's a family made decision			0
' meanwhile more information has emerged on @entity10 's demeanour behind the camera with a source telling @entity199 that the former reality star demanded to know what happened after @entity11 failed to speak one word during the interview			1
' [ @entity11 ] simply shrugged her shoulders , ' the production insider said			0
' this seemed to make @entity10 even angrier and she rolled her eyes to onlookers nearby			0
' the source added : ' we all genuinely felt for the girls			0
@entity10 is a tough cookie to please , it ’s obvious that she expects a lot from @entity8 and @entity11			0
' speaking out : @entity10 tried hard to get her point across but seemed highly embarrassed by her daughters ' silence more candid : @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity8 gave an interview to @entity4 earlier this month the website reports that the girls seemed fine , if a little sleepy , when they arrived at the @entity14 's studio in @entity222 and ' chatted to producers ' before filming their segment			1
' as soon as the girls got on the set , their mood immediately changed			0
it was obvious to anyone watching they simply froze on camera , ' the source said			1
their father @entity90 was equally unhappy about the situation , and called up @entity236 to tell them he had been watching the awkward interview with his girlfriend			1
i was laying there with @entity242 [ @entity243 ] and we were like , " say something girls			0
come on ! just say something			0
" and they did n't say anything and we were like , " ugh , this is horrible , " ' he said			1
' then i felt really bad			0
i mean , i did n't care too much for @entity10 or whatever , but i felt really bad for @entity8 and @entity11 because i love them and they 're just put in this situation			0
it was like deer in the headlights			0
' the 36 - year - old added : ' it just kind of proves my point of @entity10 bringing the kids out instead of her just sort of doing it herself			0
it all blew up in everyone 's face and i feel horrible for my children because now they 're going to have to deal with the public			1
' by body language they were probably like , " what 's the moral thing to do and what does my mom want me to do ? " they were torn and they just shutdown			0
it was just a classic case of being silent			0
you get to a point where you are like , " i do n't know who to please			0
do i please myself or do i please my parents - or my mother ? " ' when asked if he felt like @entity10 manipulated them , @entity90 said : ' in my heart that 's what i believe , that 's how i feel			0
can i prove it ? i ca n't prove it , but you ca n't take my feelings away from me			0
' he added : ' i just texted @entity8 and @entity11 today and said , " you guys looked great and i love you and have a good day in @entity222			0
" i did n't really talk about it			0
i 'm just here to offer them support and be their father			0
' damage control : @entity10 tweeted that her girls were quiet due to their appearance being their first live tv interview @entity10 later tried to make light of the awkward interview , tweeting : ' thanks to @entity307 for having @entity11 , @entity8 and me on the show today ! 1st live interview can render even the gabbiest girls speechless : ) ' her comments came after her ex-husband @entity90 told @entity312 earlier this month			1
' [ @entity10 ] uses [ his kids ] like props ... it 's so unfair to them			0
it 's a problem for her that she ca n't afford our old lifestyle anymore			0
' the former reality star who now works as a maître d ' in @entity321 also said , ' i think she wants a show with the kids again			0
' @entity4 noted that @entity90 will be appearing on the reality show @entity327 's @entity326 with new girlfriend @entity328 , a divorced mother of three , later this month			0
as they were : @entity10 and ex-husband @entity44 pictured with @entity11 , @entity8 and their eight sextuplets back in 2007			1

@entity44 said he feels ' horrible ' for his children after watching the interview
