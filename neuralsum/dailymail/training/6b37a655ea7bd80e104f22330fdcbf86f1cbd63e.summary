tough marketing controls will also be introduced in the new year , with a ban on offering breast implants as competition prizes , time - limited offers , and so - called ‘ mother and daughter deals ’ for multiple patients			1
the government has accepted most recommendations made in a review by sir @entity27 , the @entity28 medical director , after the disclosure that @entity31 firm @entity30 ( @entity3 ) made implants from industrial silicone			1
nearly 50,000 women were affected after having faulty breast implants inserted , with many having them removed again as they ruptured more frequently ( pictured ) almost 50,000 women in the @entity1 and some 400,000 worldwide were affected by the scandal , which came to light two years ago when doctors found many implants were rupturing			1
poor record - keeping by some private clinics meant that often women were unable to find out if they had the faulty implants			2
in future the implant a woman is given will be recorded in the new register , in the way hip and knee operations are already logged			2
training will be improved , with the @entity51 establishing new standards for cosmetic surgery			0
surgeons will be required to have professional indemnity to protect clients			0

' we will also be outlining rigorous plans to clamp down on irresponsible cosmetics advertising			0
for the cosmetic cowboys , be it on the high street , or in the operating theatre , there will be nowhere to hide			0
' the government ’s proposals were welcomed by the president of the @entity101 , @entity102			0
' we are thoroughly relieved that the government has seen the light in terms of the importance of reinstating the implant register - but the system must be made compulsory , otherwise it is a waste of time , ' he said			2
' whilst independent consultants and many reputable groups were able to easily contact their patients during the @entity3 implant crisis , the scandal shone a light on shoddy record - keeping from many corners of the sector ; with women being given the wrong or no information at all in regards to what had been placed within their bodies			1
' a centralised and comprehensive database is well overdue and essential for the public ’s safety and peace of mind			0

new national register will log every breast implant operation in @entity11
