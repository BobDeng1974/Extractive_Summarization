@entity0 , the job social networking site , has found itself at the center of a sexism storm after it pulled down ad posts of a woman they deemed too attractive to be a real - life web - engineer			1
the controversy began when developer networking platform @entity10 posted a series of advertisements onto @entity0 aimed at the web - engineering sector			1
however , @entity0 quickly disabled the ads with no explanation and requested images ' related to the product ' , which caused a furious response from @entity10 's ceo			1
rejected : this picture of @entity24 web developer @entity22 ( left and right ) was removed from @entity0 over the weekend and then allowed to be re-posted after accusations of sexism were leveled spam - like : this is how the advertisement appeared on @entity0 - leading some to compare it to a mass spam email using attractive women to get traffic ' the fact of the matter is : members of the tech community ( @entity0 users ) saw it as impossible that our female engineers could actually be engineers , and a leader of the tech community ( @entity0 ) agreed with them , ' wrote @entity10 's ceo , @entity44 in a blog post according to @entity46			1
' unfortunately we 're banned from showing anything except 100 percent , all make software advertisements from now on and so , that 's what you 'll be getting			0
' at first , @entity10 had simply sent the same advertisements back to @entity0 , including that of @entity24 web developer @entity22 , but @entity0 barred them until they had made the necessary changes			1
' today was a disappointing day at @entity56			0
we saw extreme sexism within the tech community , from an industry leader and advertising partner that we work with quite extensively : @entity0 , ' wrote @entity44 in a post entitled ' in @entity63			1
' outraged : toptal ceo @entity64 made his displeasure at @entity0 known through a blog post entitled ' in defense of female engineers ' in response , a spokesperson for @entity0 , which bills itself as the ' @entity69 ' , said the ads were rejected in a mistake caused by a review at their customer service team			1
'' while customer service was going through a standard process of reviewing @entity80 , @entity77 's ads were rejected in error			2
we have taken the necessary measures to approve the previously rejected ads , and @entity77 can now run them on our platform as intended			0
' however , the initial decision by @entity0 provoked a furious response from readers of @entity44 's blog			1
' @entity0 appears to be engaging in slut - shaming , and nerd oppression because no female engineer could look good			1
engineers must be slide rule nerds , ' wrote one reader in support of @entity44			0
@entity10 also used an image of actress @entity98 to represent their female engineers - which they later deleted however , the issue became complicated when it was pointed out that @entity10 did not use actual images of every engineer they were advertising			2
they used a mixture of stock photography and the real pictures of software engineers with portfolios on their website - including a picture of actress @entity98 , who appears in the @entity112 television drama series ' suits '			0
in the immediate aftermath of the sexism controversy , @entity10 deleted this profile online and were unrepentant in their defense			2
' and even if they were only stock photography , who cares ? ' wrote @entity44			0
' the point is , they 're perfectly fine and represent normal professional people			0
' once the profile using @entity98 's image was removed , the only remaining example of a woman in @entity10 's advertisements was @entity24 antara			2
' @entity22 is 100 percent authentic , ' said @entity44 , pointing out the picture used in her ad was from her own profile			0
regardless , many commentators were sided with @entity0 , despite criticizing the web giant for blocking the ads. some said that the issue was more of false representation by @entity10 and pointed out that the ads gave off a ' spam ' vibe			1
@entity0 describes itself as the ' @entity69 ' for those looking to make contacts within their respective industries ' imagine if someone saw this ad while looking over your shoulder , did n't look very closely , and all they saw was a pretty face and ' $ 1800 - 2800/wk , ' commented on blog posting			1
indeed , some felt that the images were simply to overt , even if they were the true representative of @entity22			0
' what 's with the bra strap showing ? how does that help emphasize her abilities as a developer ? ' said @entity161 851			0
' why is she staring at the camera as if she is about to make love to it ? ' the images are a bit suggestive and i would like to kindly turn the tables and ask you why you felt you needed to portray these women in such a sexually suggestive light than a professional light			0
' another wrote : ' i do n't think it 's the fact that the women are intrinsically attractive , but rather the fact that they 're consciously choosing the pose / makeup / lighting in order the emulate the design language of the @entity179 - style ads ... the fact that most of the copy could apply equally well to sex trafficking does n't help much either			0
' ultimately , even though @entity44 was satisfied that the advertisements , bar @entity184 's picture profile were readmitted , he felt it did not explain the original decision by @entity0 to remove the ads only with the women .			2

@entity0 has *denied* the accusation and claims an ad served by @entity10 was *temporarily* taken down in error
