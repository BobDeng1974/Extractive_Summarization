by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 10 may 2012 updated : 12:17 est , 10 may 2012 thousands of @entity2 and @entity3 students will be able to claim free tuition at @entity6 universities by claiming @entity8 grandparents , it was revealed today			1
last week , it emerged that students from @entity12 could avoid fees by taking dual @entity15 citizenship and applying as @entity17 students , which would result in them having their fees paid under @entity20 equality law			0
the @entity21 played down the development , saying it would only apply to a small number of students			2
loophole : thousands of @entity2 and @entity3 students will be able to claim free tuition at @entity6 universities by claiming @entity8 grandparents but it has now emerged that anyone who lives in the @entity27 who has an @entity8 grandparent can obtain an @entity8 passport and apply under the same loophole			1
nearly 625,000 people living in @entity2 and @entity3 claimed @entity8 ethnicity in the 2001 census – and as many as six million across the @entity27 are estimated to have at least one @entity8 grandparent			1
in some cases , even @entity27 residents with an @entity8 great - grandparent could apply for an @entity8 passport			2
opened up : anyone who lives in the @entity27 who has an @entity8 grandparent can obtain an @entity8 passport and apply under the loophole the children and grandchildren of people of other @entity17 nationalities living in @entity2 and @entity3 could also use the same loophole			1
under new legislation , students from @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity12 should pay fees of up to £ 9,000 a year to attend @entity6 universities , while @entity6 students study for free			1
but the loophole raises the prospect of a flood of applicants from around the @entity27			0
the development may mean greater competition for university places in @entity6			1
competition : @entity60 , pictured , is just one of the institutions which may have a greater number of applicants due to the loophole there may also be disadvantages for students applying under the @entity17 route , with a legal question mark over whether their nationality takes precedence over where they live			2
a legal loophole could allow students from @entity2 and @entity3 who have @entity8 grandparents or parents to apply for @entity15 citizenship and then apply to study in @entity6 as @entity17 students , which would result in their university fees being paid under @entity20 equality law			1
so how can @entity2 or @entity3 students with @entity8 heritage go about this ? according to the @entity88 website , if you were born outside of @entity12 , and one or both of your parents were born in @entity12 , then you are automatically an @entity8 citizen from birth and can apply directly to the @entity90 in @entity91 for an @entity8 passport			1
whereas if you have a grandparent who was born on in @entity12 , but both you and your parents were born outside @entity12 , you can claim @entity8 citizenship through your @entity8 - born grandparent through @entity96			0
if your parent has already become an @entity8 citizen through @entity96 before you were born , you are entitled to claim @entity8 citizenship through them			0
once you have gained @entity8 citizenship , you can then apply to study for free through @entity99 at a @entity100 as a non-uk @entity17 student using your @entity8 nationality			2
there is also the possibility of receiving extra help with living costs for some degree courses by applying as an @entity17 national to the @entity109			0
last night , a spokesman for @entity111 , which represents principals , said : ‘ based on the most recent statistics available , there is no indication that @entity6 ’s universities have seen a rise in applicants holding an @entity8 passport			1
‘ @entity111 continues to seek clarity from the government on this issue			0
’ @entity123 , president of the @entity124 , which represents lecturers , said : ‘ those with a dual @entity20 passport will compete with @entity6 students for the capped number of places in clearing and a huge rise in such applications is likely next year			2
‘ this shows the introduction of fees for @entity27 students outside @entity6 will play havoc with the admissions process as universities try to maximise student intake from the diminishing number of @entity27 students who will pay fees			2
’ @entity145 , president of @entity146 , said : ‘ we must see clarity on this issue so students can make an informed choice about what places are available and what support they will be able to receive			0
’ a @entity21 spokesman said : ‘ students who hold dual @entity27 and @entity17 nationality have been able to apply for fee support as non-uk @entity17 nationals at @entity6 universities for a number of years , but there is no evidence to suggest this has ever happened on a significant scale or that it is likely to			1
‘ eligibility for claiming nationality varies by state and it is for the student to prove they hold @entity17 nationality before the relevant date			0
we closely monitor application trends and are prepared to act if it appears that issues such as this are arising			0
‘ we are also exploring the introduction of an @entity17 management fee , within the bounds of @entity17 law			0
’ ‘ we continue to seek clarity			0
