it 's a theory that many women have held for years			0
and now a study has revealed men really are the more stupid sex			0
analysis of the @entity6 - an annual review of the most foolish ways people have died - has found almost 90 per cent of the accolades were ' won ' by males			1
worthy candidates include a terrorist who opened his own letter bomb , and a man who attempted to travel by hitching a shopping trolley to a train			1
nominees have to improve the gene pool by eliminating themselves from the human race using foolish methods			1
worthy candidates have included a terrorist who unthinkingly opened his own letter bomb on its return after he posted it with insufficient stamps			1
other examples include the man who shot himself in the head with a ' spy pen ' weapon to show his friend it was real , and the thief attempting to purloin a steel cable from a lift shaft - and unbolted it while standing in the lift which then plummeted to the ground , killing him			1
of 332 independently verified nominations , 14 were ruled out of the analysis because they were shared by male and females - usually adventurous couples in compromising positions			1
of the 318 valid cases remaining , 282 ( 88.7 per cent ) were awarded to males and just 36 to females , a gender difference entirely consistent with male idiot theory ( @entity59 ) that states men are idiots and idiots do stupid things			2
the award is named after @entity19 ( left ) due to his theory of evolution			2
nominees have to improve the gene pool by eliminating themselves from the human race using foolish methods			2
examples include the man who shot himself in the head with a ' spy pen ' weapon to show his friend it was real ( stock picture right ) writing in the @entity79 , the researchers said it is puzzling men are willing to take such unnecessary risks - simply as a rite of passage , in pursuit of male social esteem or solely in exchange for ' bragging rights '			1
dr @entity88 , of the @entity89 , said : ' idiotic risks are defined as senseless risks , where the apparent payoff is negligible or non existent , and the outcome is often extremely negative and often final			0
' according to ' male idiot theory ' ( @entity59 ) many of the differences in risk seeking behaviour , emergency department admissions , and mortality may be explained by the observation that men are idiots and idiots do stupid things			2
' there are anecdotal data supporting @entity59 , but to date there has been no systematic analysis of sex differences in idiotic risk taking behaviour			0
' he said an honourable mention must go to the man who slipped when using a belt sander as an auto erotic device and lost a testicle			1
repairing his scrotum with a staple gun , he was able to salvage his remaining testicle thus failing to eliminate himself completely from the gene pool , so he did not qualify for an award and was eliminated from the analysis			1
the researchers admitted the study has limitations because women may be more likely to nominate men for a @entity6 , or the sex difference may reflect differences in alcohol use between men and women			1
but dr @entity88 said : ' despite these limitations there can be little doubt @entity6 winners seem to make little or no real assessment of the risk or attempt at risk management			1
they just do it anyway			0
in some cases , the intelligence of the award winner may be questioned			2
' for example , the office workers watching a construction worker demolishing a car park in the adjacent lot must have wondered about the man 's intelligence			0
' after two days of office speculation - how does he plan to remove the final support to crash the car park down safely ? - they discovered , on the third day , that he did n't have a plan			0
the concrete platform collapsed , crushing him to death and flattening his mini-excavator			0
' he said anecdotal data support the hypothesis alcohol makes men feel ' bulletproof ' after a few drinks , and it would be naïve to rule this out			0
dr @entity88 added : ' for example , the three men who played a variation on @entity171 roulette alternately taking shots of alcohol and then stamping on an unexploded @entity175 land mine			0
( spoiler alert : the mine eventually exploded , demolishing the bar and killing all three men			0
) ' the researchers believe @entity59 deserves further investigation , and , ' with the festive season upon us , we intend to follow up with observational field studies and an experimental study - males and females , with and without alcohol - in a semi-naturalistic @entity190 setting			0

@entity6 is an annual review of most foolish way people have died
scientists were *surprised* to discover 90 *%* of award *‘* winners *’* were male
worthy candidates include a terrorist who opened his own letter bomb
another man attempted to travel by hitching a shopping trolley to a train
one man lost a testicle while using a belt sander to *pleasure* himself
but was excluded from award after he repaired scrotum with a staple gun
