using the code people ' could put together their own rocket ’ by @entity2 and @entity3 ever fancied building your own space rocket but just do n’t know where to start ? soon , @entity7 could lend a helping hand			1
on thursday april 10 , the space agency is set to reveal its enormous database highlighting where to find software for more than 1,000 of its projects			1
projects will include rockets , @entity18 rovers , climate simulators and cryogenic systems			1
on thursday april 10 , @entity7 is set to reveal its enormous database of where to find software for more than 1,000 of its projects , including old rocket ship code			1
pictured is the @entity26 in 1981 @entity7 will offer a searchable database of projects , according to @entity29 , @entity30 at @entity7			2
‘ we have collected a large amount of software projects , everything from design tools to robotic control systems , ’ @entity29 tells @entity31			1
‘ we find that those problems we solve actually translate well into other problems people have , so we ’re making this all available in one place			2
’ it will develop a ‘ @entity47 for astronauts ’ by hosting the actual software code in its own online repository , which will be found at @entity46			1
all of the code will be free of copyright , but special clearance will be required for anyone who wants to access projects like rocket guidance systems			1
many projects are already available online , but they are spread out across many sites and difficult to find			0
what anyone does with the code is up to them			0
' they could put together their own rocket , ’ says @entity29			0
‘ it does take a bit more than that though , it is rocket science [ after all ]			0
’ as well as being online , @entity29 says limited print copies will be made of the @entity69 projects will include rocket guidance systems , @entity18 rovers , climate simulators and cryogenic systems			1
pictured is one of @entity7 's cryogenics complexes that tests the performance of thermal systems to take fuel into space @entity7 has been running its technology transfer programme for over 50 years			2
it has given us everything from satellite television to memory foam pillows to the ' space rose , ' ( pictured ) a unique perfume scent created in microgravity			0
however this is the the space agency actively pushed out its software code to the public to promote technology transfer within industries			1
as for real - world uses , @entity29 says scheduling software could be used to tackle tasks at a hospital , or code from @entity100 could be used for @entity102 machines where a bunch of different code is lined up			0
‘ it ’s all part of an ongoing @entity7 initiative to provide as much public benefit from our dollars as possible , ’ says @entity29			2
‘ the dollars do n’t just go into space , they come back in the form of applications on @entity114			0
’ one of the main goals of the database is to help develop technology that can be transferred to other sectors			2
they hope it will help hackers and entrepreneurs push their existing ideas in new directions — as well as help trigger new concepts			0
the new code database is the result of a 2011 order from president @entity130 that federal agencies speed up the pace of technology transfer			0
and @entity29 expects to see many more projects added to the database after its has been launched .			0

on april 10 , @entity7 will reveal database of software for over 1,000 projects
these are likely to include rocket guidance systems and climate simulators
by next year it will develop a ‘ @entity47 for astronauts ’ by hosting the software code for its technology in one place
using the code people ' could put together their own rocket ’
