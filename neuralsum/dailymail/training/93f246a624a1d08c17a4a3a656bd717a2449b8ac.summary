after a few tough years @entity0 is finding his best form at the right time for this year 's championships the @entity8 crowds have n't drawn the best from @entity0 since his appearance in the 2011 final he told @entity24 : ‘ i ’ve always said that family come first and it was hard			1
people were talking about my finishing but i could n’t give two damns what they thought or said			0
‘ if anyone in the world says “ that ’s just the way it goes ” then they ’re idiots			0

‘ i ’ve had too much on in the past few years , but now everything has settled it has been a good year			2
’ @entity0 changed his darts after his narrow 4 - 3 defeat by eventual champion @entity45 in the third round last year in a bid to rediscover his form			1
he has also welcomed a new addition to the family - his eight - month - old son @entity51			0
@entity0 will face one of @entity53 or @entity54 in his first round match on saturday @entity0 was knocked out by eventual champion @entity45 last year , leading to a change of darts and the lift in his spirits have seen his results improve this year , so much so that he enters the tournament as the no 4 seed when last year he was as low as no 18			1
on the birth of his son @entity51 , @entity0 said : ‘ it was a huge weight off my shoulders and i ’m enjoying things just now which makes my darts a lot easier for me			1
the last couple of years i was n’t enjoying my darts , but i have this year			2

‘ it ’s always a bad thing because i like to know who i ’m playing against , ’ the world no 4 said			0
‘ you ca n’t keep a tab on every player in the world and in the last few years i have had really tough games in the first round			0
but that is the way it is now because there are so many good players these days			0
