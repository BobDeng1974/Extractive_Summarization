by @entity0 published : 18:52 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 02:43 est , 17 june 2013 @entity1 will today try to launch talks on a free trade deal between @entity4 and the @entity5 that could be worth £ 380 a year for every @entity7 household			1
the prime minister wants to use this week 's @entity9 in @entity10 to launch formal negotiations on an agreement that could be worth up to £ 10billion to the @entity7 and £ 85billion worldwide			2
he will argue that a free trade deal – similar to that which operates inside the @entity16 – would ' turbo - charge the transatlantic economy '			1
trade , tax and transparency were three vital drivers of growth that could produce ' transformative results ' , he said			2
mr @entity1 said he wanted ' a meeting where we can look each other in the eye ' to solve the problems			2
but the most important issue is how to promote economic recovery , with action needed to boost growth , create jobs and reduce poverty , he added			0
' let 's be clear , we still need to deal with fiscal deficits , ' he said			1
' each country needs to press on with sorting out its public finances			0
each country needs active monetary policy to kickstart the affordable loans and mortgages that businesses and families need			0
' and each country needs to deal with the problem of youth unemployment by pursuing the structural reforms and flexible labour markets that are vital for competitiveness and jobs			1
' special relationship : @entity5 president @entity62 ( right ) and @entity1 in march last year @entity63 has urged for any trade agreement to include special protections for its film and tv industries against @entity5 imports			0
there is also uncertainty over another of the prime minister 's @entity9 priorities – an international deal to crack down on tax havens			1
another key aim of the summit is a global deal on the payment of ransoms to terror groups who take hostages			1
mr @entity1 hopes it will ' choke off ' a source of terror funding , given that some countries do still pay ransoms			0
' it 's an ambitious agenda			0
it 's a very practical agenda , ' he said .			0

@entity73 will argue a deal would ' turbo - charge the transatlantic economy '
it would be similar to that which operates inside the @entity16
