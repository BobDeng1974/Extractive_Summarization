by @entity0 published : 19:08 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 19:08 est , 23 september 2013 four senior doctors who presided over the deaths of hundreds of patients from neglect at @entity6 hospitals have been let off without punishment			1
the @entity8 said last night it was closing the cases because there was not enough evidence that they had done anything wrong			1
the decision means not a single doctor involved in the scandal has been struck off or suspended			2
four senior doctors who presided over the deaths of hundreds of patients from neglect at @entity6 hospitals have been let off without punishment so far only three nurses have been struck off , and only one manager , @entity20 , head of legal services , sacked			1
she was then awarded £ 100,000 for unfair dismissal			2
‘ it is appalling and frightening – it confirms what many members of the public have always feared , ’ said @entity23 , who has campaigned on behalf of @entity6 victims			1
‘ what sort of message does this send to doctors ? “ do n’t worry , whatever you do or do n’t do in a management role , you have nothing to fear			1
” ’ up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at the trust between 2005 and 2009 in one of the worst @entity41 care scandals			1
the @entity8 initially investigated 43 doctors over poor care at @entity6 , but just two have been given warnings and the rest have escaped without punishment			1
@entity47 , 53 , set up the campaign group cure the @entity41 after her mother @entity49 died at the trust in 2007			1
she said it was dreadful news one is still having his case considered by the @entity8 , but relatives fear he , too , will be let off			1
yesterday ’s decision involved the most senior doctors from @entity6 – two former medical directors , dr @entity59 and dr @entity60 , their deputy , dr @entity62 , and the medic in charge of the trust ’s disastrous @entity66 unit , dr @entity68			1
@entity47 , 53 , who set up the campaign group cure the @entity41 after her mother @entity49 died at the trust in 2007 , said : ‘ it ’s dreadful news			1
i ’m so disappointed that no one is being held to account			2
this decision just exposes the failure of the @entity8 ’s processes and it ’s further evidence that it is n’t fit for purpose			1
it sends a huge signal to anyone in the @entity41 that it does n’t matter what they do – they will escape without punishment			2
’ the @entity8 said it had been advised by one of the senior barristers involved in the public inquiry into the scandal , @entity90 , that there is ‘ no realistic prospect ’ of securing a finding against the four doctors whose cases were dropped yesterday			1
@entity96 , the watchdog ’s chief executive , said : ‘ there is not the evidence to establish either misconduct or impairment against any of the doctors			2
' we know many of those who saw and experienced the appalling care at the trust feel badly let down and frustrated that no one is taking responsibility for what happened			2
‘ however , the law is clear : we can only prosecute a doctor if there is sufficient evidence of that individual ’s wrongdoing			2
’ in july , the @entity116 barred @entity6 nurses @entity117 and @entity118 from practising for undermining the public ’s faith in the profession			1
another nurse , @entity122 , was struck off last week			0
the @entity116 is still deciding on the fate of @entity124 , who was director of nursing from 1998 to 2006			0

linda , @entity129 , @entity130 , 11 hours ago what justice is that for those who suffered & families who are left behind wondering just that ? @entity136 , @entity137 , 12 hours ago the higher up the establishment ladder the more equal the justice gets			0
( @entity140 ) glad @entity141 , @entity142 , 12 hours ago well ya do n't say ...			0
surprised any one ? ? ? @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity130 , 13 hours ago this absolutely beggars belief			0
drop a cigarette in the street and you get fined			0
kill someone and the government tells you to " carry on "			0
@entity155 , @entity156 , 13 hours ago is it credible that with this apparent level of avoidable death that no doctor is culpable ? while 3 nurses and a manager are			0
there is something wrong here			0
@entity165 , @entity166 , @entity130 , 14 hours ago the power and control in hospitals moved from doctors and nurses years ago under @entity172 with non medical managers and administrators ruling the roost			2
of course it suits government to blame medical incompetence rather than politically driven stripping of budget leading to skeleton staffing			0
do n't shoot the starving dog , deal with the owner that refused to feed it ! ! @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity130 , 14 hours ago they will always close ranks and turn a blind eye to suspect deaths in hospitals			0
that old pneumonia tacked on the death cert will cover everything you will find			0
@entity196 , bangkok thailand , @entity130 , 15 hours ago they must have a mighty big carpet with all the incidents being swept under it ! ' no evidence ' ? im sure the police if they were involved that is , would find plenty of evidence and bring those responsible to justice ! talk about looking after each other ! this surely takes the cake ! the views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of @entity217			0
