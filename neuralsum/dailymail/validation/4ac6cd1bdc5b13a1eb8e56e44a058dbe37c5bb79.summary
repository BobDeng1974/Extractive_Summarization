get the truth by @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 ever wanted to know the best way of extracting a confession ? me neither , but here ’s an unexpectedly fascinating book that shows how to do just that			1
interrogation is an unfortunate name with regrettable connotations not only will you learn how to have the guilty singing like canaries , this book also comes up with some genuinely important insights about the interrogation process			1
such an unfortunate term , with such regrettable connotations			0
torture , screaming agony , electrodes , waterboarding — those kind of connotations			2
yes , but it need n’t be like that , say the authors , former @entity30 officers who are painfully aware of what ‘ @entity30 interrogation ’ is taken to mean — torture , screaming agony , electrodes , waterboarding — and who are appalled by that reputation			1
i think the authors are also against torture and pain on ethical grounds , but the nature of their disgust is partly professional			1
because it turns out that interrogation - by - torment is ineffective , as the @entity30 ’s skilled specialists have known for some time			1
only rank amateurs would ever try to extract confessions and information by upping the voltage or giving the thumbscrews another turn			0
the only approach that has any chance of success , state the authors , is exactly the opposite			2
professionals who really know what they ’re doing try to take all traces of violence or confrontation out of an interrogation , turning it instead into an interview based on chummy sympathy and understanding			0
good interrogators will lower their voice , talk slowly , claim empathy with their suspects and then — well , and then just keep on talking lowly and slowly seems to be the gist			0
because what appears to work best is an interrogator who chats on and on , quietly , reassuringly , understandingly , often repetitively			0
‘ we all make mistakes , @entity81 ’s saying we do n’t make mistakes because , you know , @entity81 , we all make mistakes , ’ and so on and on and on			0
the comforting drone of the interrogator ’s monologue may sound mindless , but it is carefully created and should contain five key features			0
these are rationalising the action ( you needed the money ) ; projecting the blame ( it was their fault for not paying you enough ) ; minimising the seriousness ( we ’ve all nicked post-it notes ) ; socialising the situation ( this kind of thing happens a lot , it ’s nothing we have n’t seen a million times ) ; and emphasising the truth ( if you could explain what happened when you took the money , that would be great and would help us all move on )			0
acts of terrible violence , gross betrayals , fraud , theft , murder — the skilled interrogator will mimic thorough understanding of the worst crimes to keep up the pretence of being on the suspect ’s side			2
number of tweets the @entity30 monitors every day at the same time , the interrogator will be intent on keeping that suspect locked into a mode of short - term thinking — keeping the focus on particulars and specifics , trying like crazy to stop the suspect considering the long - term consequences of telling an implicating truth and being found guilty			1
it is a process that has had enormous success , claim the authors , though this is a success that is anecdotal			2
but the anecdotes are pretty convincing			0
take the example of @entity136 , one of the first @entity138 leaders to be captured , who was being successfully won over by the pretend empathy approach until a hardliner applied torture instead — and found his victim clammed up			2
the book consists mainly of such case studies from the authors ’ interrogating careers , supplemented weirdly with 70 - odd pages of commentary by a lawyer type who adds his own legal anecdotes to make the same points			1
presumably , this book is meant to show how the @entity30 ’s interrogation techniques can be applied in the normal world			1
but it struck me that here was an opportunity missed , since there is n’t any effective attempt to transfer the professionals ’ methods to everyday situations : how to winkle out the truth about which child broke the kitchen window , how to get your partner to fess up about what really happened at the office party			0
but though it misses that trick , this book does find itself making , i think to its own surprise , a genuine and important contribution to the ongoing debate , particularly in the @entity175 , about the use of torture such as waterboarding during interrogations of terrorists			1
forget any ethical argument , say the authors — any form of physical coercion , far less torture , just does n’t work .			1
