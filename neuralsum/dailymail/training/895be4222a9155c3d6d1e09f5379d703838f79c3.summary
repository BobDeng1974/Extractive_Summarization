speaking about the accident he told @entity17 : ' basically i was praying for the best and preparing for the worst			2
' in a situation like that , that 's honestly all you could do			0
' mr @entity3 added : ' actually going through the machine itself was n't the worst part about it			1
' what was the worst part ( was ) the not knowing what was going to happen			0
