by @entity0 published : 08:31 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 19:49 est , 19 november 2013 cruelty was allowed to become ' normal ' in the @entity3 at the time of the @entity5 and neither staff nor ministers took any notice , @entity1 said yesterday			1
the health secretary promised to overhaul hospitals so they provide the ' safest , most compassionate and most effective ' care in the world			1
he made a string of formal recommendations to drive up standards in the wake of the @entity19 scandal , in which hundreds of patients died needlessly and staff were said to have become ' immune ' to the sound of pain			2
named : every patient will have the name of the doctor and nurse responsible for their care written above their bed , as part of measures to hold @entity3 staff to account they include : * fines for hospitals if they try to cover up mistakes * every patient to have an allocated nurse and doctor , with the names posted above their beds * @entity43 to publish the number of nurses working on each ward * doctors and nurses to be suspended or even struck off for not owning up to mistakes * doctors and nurses to face up to five years in jail if they wilfully neglect patients * failed managers to be blacklisted and barred from getting other jobs in the @entity3			1
* @entity43 to put up ' how to complain ' guides in wards			0
up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly at @entity57 between 2005 and 2009 , yet a damning inquiry by sir @entity59 , @entity60 , at the beginning of this year warned it could happen again			2
the government has since been drawing up a series of recommendations to improve care across the health service and prevent staff from trying to cover up their mistakes			1
health secretary @entity1 ( left ) said that cruelty had become the norm in the @entity3 , and he warned it must never happen again while @entity73 's shadow health secretary @entity72 said the government 's words had to be followed by action outlining his response to the @entity5 in the @entity78 yesterday , mr @entity1 said : ' @entity79 became normal in our @entity3 and no - one noticed			1
the inquiry shows the devastating effects of overly defensive responses â€“ hurting families , suppressing the truth and preventing lessons being learned			0
' the @entity3 is a moral being or it is nothing			0
i do not simply want to prevent another @entity57 , i want our @entity3 to be a beacon across the world , not just for equity but its excellence			2
' i want it to offer the safest , most compassionate and most effective care available anywhere and i believe it can			2
' the proposals include fining hospitals if they try to cover up mistakes which cause harm or death			2
trusts could be made to pay out tens of thousands of pounds to the @entity3 for the most serious errors			0
every patients will also be given the name of a nurse and a consultant who is in charge of their care			1
hospitals will have to publish the number of nurses working on each ward and be expected to put up ' how to complain ' guides , with step - by - step instructions for what patients and families should do if they are unhappy			1
mr @entity1 told @entity125 patients needed to have confidence in the care they would receive from the @entity3 the @entity128 into the scandal at @entity19 heard hundreds of patients died there from 2005 to 2009 they will also have to publish figures on the number of complaints every three months , with details of what lessons have been learnt from each one			1
staff who do not immediately own up to errors would face tougher sanctions than those who are honest , under proposals			0
@entity3 officials are liaising with watchdogs to see whether honesty could be taken into account in punishments			0
but @entity148 , whose mother @entity149 died at @entity150 , said she was ' disappointed ' that mr @entity1 's proposals did not go far enough			1
she and other campaigners wanted new laws protecting whistleblowers from the sack and a legal obligation for staff to be honest with patients			2
meanwhile , former @entity73 health spokesman @entity159 admitted her party had made it more important for nurses to take exams than to care			1
she said : ' for many members of the public , one of the problems with general standards of care may have been the push under a @entity73 government for an all - graduate nursing profession			1
and there is a view that what that has led to is elevating taking exams over and above basic levels of care			1
' alone : @entity180 , who died at the @entity181 a hospital has apologised after a dying 84 - year - old woman was forced to make a desperate call to her family after being abandoned by staff			1
@entity180 died ' frightened and alone ' in a ward which resembled a ' ghost town ' after doctors and nurses at @entity181 failed to come to her aid			0
the great - grandmother used her mobile to call son @entity195 as she struggled to breathe , without a single member of staff on the ward to help her			0
her eldest son @entity199 rushed to the hospital , arriving 20 minutes later , but found that she had died alone with the bedside monitor alarm still sounding			0
@entity202 , 63 , said the family were ' angry and devastated ' at the appalling treatment of their mother			0
he said : ' she died alone and frightened because of the hospital 's countless failings			0
if my mother had been given the care she deserved she would still be here today			0
' the retired decorator described the ward as a ' ghost town ' and said @entity216 , who suffered from a terminal lung disease , was left for a further four hours before a doctor arrived			0
the hospital has now admitted to a catalogue of shocking blunders in relation to the death on july 27 and apologised , following an internal inquiry .			0
