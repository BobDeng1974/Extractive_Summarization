while humans have been using sonar since the 1940s , marine mammals have been hunting prey with it for tens of millions of years			0
now a new fossil study suggests an ancient whale used sound beams to find food 28 million years ago			1
the new whale species , called @entity10 , was found to have air pockets in its skull that had similarities to those used by modern day porpoises and dolphins to send out focused sound beams			1
the skull of the 28 - million - year - old @entity10 macei			1
its anatomy and density variation indicate that this early toothed whale used echolocation to find its prey the discovery places the evolution of the technique , called echolocation , to around 32 million years ago that was relatively soon after whales , around 35 million years ago , split into two major cetacean groups - toothed whales that were active hunters and toothless baleen whales that were filter feeders , straining food like krill from the ocean			1
@entity40 , an anatomy professor at @entity41 who led the research published in the journal nature , called echolocation ' an amazing trait			1
' ' it 's a sonar - like system which allows them basically to navigate and find food , particularly in waters where there 's little light , either at great depth or in very turbulent waters with a lot of mud , like estuaries or around marshes , ' he added			0
an artistic reconstruction of the 28 million - year - old @entity10 as it patrolled the shallows near present - day @entity60 whales that use echolocation produce very high - frequency vocalisations through a soft - tissue nasal passage located between the blowhole and skull			1
other mammals , including people , produce sounds using the voice box , or larynx , inside the neck			0
when air is pushed through the whale 's nasal passage , it produces extremely high frequency clicks , squeaks and squeals that then echo off objects in the water , enabling the whale to get a high - resolution audio image of its surroundings			2
@entity85 , whose fossilised remains include a 22 - inch skull , neck vertebrae and ribs , was about 10 to 11 feet long and probably swam in a shallow ocean environment , feeding on fish and squid			0
the fossils were unearthed near @entity94 , @entity95 , outside @entity60 , said @entity60 geology professor @entity96 , another of the researchers			0
while @entity85 looked superficially like some smaller modern - day toothed whales , it was not closely related to them			0
' this is a member of an extinct family that split off very early from other echolocating whales , dolphins and porpoises , ' professor @entity40 added			2
' they went extinct 25 million or 26 million years ago and they do n't have any living relatives			1

' they can " see " the fish and then they know to swim in that direction to catch it , ' @entity135 said			0
nearly a decade ago , scientists unearthed a complete toothed whale skull , along with a few neck vertebrae and some ribs in a fossil - rich region near @entity60 the sound - producing mechanism is complex , with big muscles , air pockets and bodies of fat - all in a small facial area			1
the sound is too high frequency for human ears to hear			0
modern - day whales that use echolocation possess a melon , or a fat - filled organ in the head , that focuses the sound wave			2
professor @entity40 said he suspects that @entity85 already had this organ			0
the whale 's genus name , @entity85 , means ' cavity head ' in recognition of a very deep pocket atop its skull thought to be associated with an air sinus used in echolocation			2
whales are not the only animals that use echolocation			0
bats , which also first appeared more than 50 million years ago , use it while flying to pinpoint insects and other prey			1
the first whales appeared more than 50 million years ago , arising from wolf - size land dwellers			1
whales gradually became better suited to sea life and grew larger - one called @entity180 that lived about 40 million years ago was at least 56 feet long			1
@entity181 was a later adaptation			0
toothed whales , dolphins , and porpoises produce their high - frequency vocalisations through a constricted area in the nasal passages below the blowhole			2

28 million - year - old fossil was of a species of whale called @entity10
skull had air pockets similar to that used by dolphins to send sound beams
find places *origin* of technique , called echolocation , to *32m* years ago
this was relatively soon after whales , around 35 million years ago , split into two groups : active hunters and a toothless baleen species
