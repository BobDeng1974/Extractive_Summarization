by @entity0 @entity1 is preparing to humiliate the @entity2 by backing a @entity4 plan for criminals caught carrying a knife for the second time to face an automatic jail sentence			1
@entity9 was said to be ' bouncing off the walls ' last week after secret @entity12 correspondence was leaked to the @entity13 revealing senior @entity2 are resisting @entity15 proposals to toughen punishments for repeat offences			1
now @entity1 sources suggest the party is planning to exploit what has become one of the worst coalition splits since @entity23 vetoed an @entity25 treaty in 2011 without consulting the @entity2			1
@entity2 deputy prime minister @entity9 appearing on @entity27 's current affairs programme , the @entity28 @entity29 is said to ready to back a change in the law in a vote on knife crime to be forced by the @entity15 in the commons as soon next week			1
that would almost certainly result in the move being approved by @entity37 , regardless of the stance of the @entity2			1
' we are prepared to back the amendment , ' a senior @entity1 source said			2
a decision is understood to have been taken by the @entity44 's office to support tougher sentencing for knife offenders late on friday and a vote in the @entity34 is expected as soon as may 12			2
last week , the @entity13 published a leaked letter to mr @entity9 from @entity2 treasury chief secretary @entity49 rejecting plans to impose a mandatory six - month jail sentence on any adult convicted of a second knife offence as too expensive			1
marked ' restricted ' , it was sent the day after the tragic stabbing of teacher @entity55			0
in an earlier letter to the deputy prime minister , @entity2 schools minister @entity56 said mandatory minimum sentences were ' too blunt an instrument ' and said he was unwilling to support them			1
the deputy prime minister is understood to have blamed the @entity15 for the highly unusual breach of @entity12 confidentiality			2
a letter from chief secretary to the treasury @entity49 mp was leaked last week a senior @entity2 source said the @entity15 should ' examine their own consciences ' over the leak , accusing them of engaging in political games in the aftermath of mrs @entity55 's killing			1
@entity15 sources said the proposal to tighten the law had been under discussion for months in advance			2
conservative cabinet ministers including @entity79 , the justice secretary , @entity81 , the home secretary , and @entity83 , the @entity84 and @entity85 , the defence secretary , have all lined up behind the plan for tougher knife laws			0
@entity89 , the veteran cabinet minister , is understood to be the only senior @entity15 backing the @entity2 , arguing judges ' hands should not be tied			1
mr @entity79 wants to use a forthcoming crime bill to introduce automatic jail sentences for offenders caught carrying knives for a second time			0
@entity97 , the @entity97 mp for @entity98 , has tabled am amendment to the @entity100 introduce automatic jail terms , which has already been supported by 30 @entity15 mps			2
backing from @entity1 would guarantee it would be passed by the @entity34			0
mr @entity97 said only one in four of the 16,031 cases of knife possession last year resulted in immediate custody			0
' over 2,500 of those caught in possession of a knife last year were aged 10 to 17 , ' he added			0
' if we need any more convincing about the weak message being sent out about carrying a knife , then we need to look no further if thousands of children don ' t regard it as serious			0
' i hope backbenchers from across the @entity118 will support this amendment and it can become law			0
' the support across the country and amongst backbench mps should give the deputy prime minister pause to reflect on his decision			0
it should also give the prime minister the confidence that he would be in tune with both his party and the country to support this measure			0
