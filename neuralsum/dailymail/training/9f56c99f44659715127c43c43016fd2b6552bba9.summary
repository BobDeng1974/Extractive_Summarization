it ’s now a three - way battle for ownership of the @entity3 , as @entity4 revealed it will take on @entity5 and @entity6 amid claims its @entity9 territory is connected to the pole via a ridge beneath the @entity12			1
huge , sparsely populated @entity9 is semi-autonomous @entity4 territory and its continental shelf is linked to the pole by the 1,800km - long @entity15 , which runs beneath the @entity12			1
foreign minister @entity16 will today deliver a claim to a @entity19 panel in @entity20 , as @entity4 becomes the latest country to make a play for the vast untapped oil and gas reserves thought to lie beneath the ice			1
the @entity15 ( shown in dark blue ) links @entity9 's continental shelf with the @entity3			1
the red dotted line shows the extent of the five @entity12 countries ' claims on the region under existing international law , which allows them to claim ownership of land up to 200 miles from their northern borders sea ice in a @entity9 fjord			1
the vast island is connected to the @entity3 via a ridge below the @entity12 a @entity42 team heads for the @entity3			0
the @entity15 connects the abstract spot to @entity9 melting sea ice in the @entity12			2
global warming is opening up opportunities to tap new mineral resources @entity4 soldiers next to a @entity4 flag on @entity50 , between @entity9 and @entity5			2
@entity4 has today staked a claim to fly its flag over the @entity3			2
the five @entity12 countries — the @entity54 , @entity6 , @entity55 , @entity5 and @entity4 — all have areas surrounding the @entity3 , but only @entity5 and @entity6 had indicated an interest in it before @entity4 's claim			1
@entity16 told the @entity60 that the @entity12 nations had so far ' stuck to the rules of the game ' and he hoped they would continue to do so			0
in 2008 , the five pledged that control of the @entity3 region would be decided in an orderly settlement within the framework of the @entity19 , and possible overlapping claims would be dealt with bilaterally			1
interest in the @entity12 is intensifying as global warming shrinks the polar ice , opening up possible resource development and new shipping lanes			0
the area is believed to hold an estimated 13 per cent of the world 's undiscovered oil and 30 per cent of its untapped gas			1
@entity4 foreign minister @entity16 will today take his country 's claim to the @entity3 to the @entity19 @entity16 said he expects no quick decisions , with other countries also sending in claims			1
he said : ' this is a historical milestone for @entity4 and many others as the area has an impact on the lives of lot of people			0
‘ after the @entity19 panel had taken a decision based on scientific data , comes a political process			2
' i expect this to take some time			0
an answer will come in a few decades			0
' between 2007 and 2012 , @entity4 scientists with colleagues from @entity5 , @entity103 and @entity6 surveyed a 2,000km ( 1,240 - mile ) - long underwater mountain range that runs north of @entity105			1
they concluded that @entity9 is geologically attached to the ridge			0
that prompted the @entity4 to claim the right to exploit an area of 345,600 square miles ( 895,00 square kilometres )			0
@entity110 , a senior geophysicist with the @entity111 and @entity9 , said : ' the @entity15 ridge is the natural extension of the @entity9 shelf			2
' coincidentally , the @entity3 which is a tiny , tiny abstract spot lies in the area			0
' under international law , @entity5 , @entity4 , @entity55 , @entity6 and the @entity54 - the five countries with territories near the @entity119 - are allotted 200 nautical miles of territory stretching from their northern coasts			1
however , under the @entity125 , exclusive claims can be vastly expanded for countries that can prove their part of the continental shelf extends beyond that zone			2
in 2007 , @entity6 sent a submarine to plant a flag 14,000ft beneath the ice of the @entity3 in an audacious bid to lay claim to the resource - rich @entity12			1
last year , @entity5 applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the @entity139 , including extensions into the @entity12 seafloor covering roughly 656,000 square miles ( 1.7 million sq km )			0
this is roughly the size of @entity143 and the @entity145 region combined			0
now @entity4 has made its move , claiming 345,600 square miles ( 895,000 square kilometres ) of new territory .			0

the 1,800km - long @entity15 runs beneath the @entity12 , connecting @entity9 's continental shelf with the @entity3
the region is thought to hold 13 per cent of the world 's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 per cent of its untapped natural gas
@entity4 foreign minister @entity16 will today deliver a claim to a @entity19 panel in @entity20
@entity4 the latest of the five @entity12 countries to make a play for the pole , with @entity5 and @entity6 having already staked claims
