@entity0 goes under the knife on tuesday in @entity2 and the former @entity4 defender is not the only one whose career could depend on the operation ’s success			1
@entity9 ’s sporting director @entity8 set himself up for a fall when he signed the @entity12 international despite his terrible luck with injuries in the previous two years			1
he set himself up again when he said on the day of his presentation that the player was ready to perform immediately and that he had no concerns over his fitness			0
@entity0 poses as he is presented as a @entity9 player after joining from @entity4 in the summer @entity0 ( left ) poses alongside fellow new signing @entity20 ( centre ) and @entity23 ( right ) and , not having learned from the previous two instances , he has now said he should be available for the semi-final stage of the @entity26			2
@entity9 are so convinced the player will recover before the end of the season they are not even attempting to use a @entity32 rule that allows them to sign a replacement if the player is to miss the rest of the campaign in its entirety			0
former @entity9 and @entity39 keeper @entity8 is one of football ’s nice guys with none of the arrogant airs that others might allow themselves were they occupying the position of sporting director at one of the biggest clubs in the world			1
but as sporting director of one of the biggest clubs in the world he lives or dies by such declarations and more importantly by his signings			1
@entity0 is , for many , one transfer market mistake too many – the drop that overflows the glass , as they say in @entity60			2
@entity0 ( second right ) joined @entity9 from @entity4 , where he had a number of injury problems almost since the day he replaced @entity65 as the man signing the players at the @entity68 in 2010 , a new central defender has been the priority but season after season @entity9 have failed to bring in the right man			2
this summer the club failed to land @entity74 ’s young @entity73 @entity72 and overlooked a host of @entity32 based options such as @entity78 ’s @entity77 , @entity80 ’s @entity79 , @entity82 ’s @entity81 or @entity84 ’s @entity83			0
instead went for @entity86 ’s 31 - year - old @entity85 and @entity4 ’s @entity0			0
the later is yet to play a single minute and the former has played well but will never play well enough to justify his £ 16million price tag given his age			0
@entity72 ( left ) was a player that @entity9 missed out on during their summer transfer spending @entity9 sporting director @entity8 ( right ) poses alongside @entity93 ( centre ) not all of @entity9 ’s errors in the transfer market are his			1
many can be traced back to a cash shortage stemming form former president @entity100 ’s obsession with signing @entity93 who when all add - on payments were totted up left them with little change from £ 80m			0
but his fingerprints are on the signing of @entity73 full - back @entity106 who has started only one game ; the signing two seasons ago of @entity111 with the promise that he could also play as a centre - back ; and most recently missing out on @entity115 ’s 18 - year - old midfielder @entity114 , who he seemed to have sealed but who looks like ultimately being signed by rivals @entity117			0
all that might be forgotten if @entity0 returns with two outstanding semi-final performances in the @entity26 but @entity9 supporters have long since stopped sharing their sporting director ’s optimism .			1

@entity0 has been *plagued* by injuries over the last two years
he will undergo an operation on tuesday that may revive his career
