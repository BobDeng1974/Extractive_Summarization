when @entity1 named his team at @entity4 ’s luxurious @entity3 on tuesday lunchtime , it was a final act of defiance			1
monday morning ... @entity7 prepared to wield axe if results do n't improve tuesday night ... @entity11 and @entity12 in frame to replace @entity1 @entity13 paid for his pitiful performance at @entity15 on saturday and @entity1 knew the evening would end in yet another change in personnel			1
on this occasion , in the office of the @entity21 manager			1
but @entity1 sensed the end was coming long before his 42nd and last game in charge			1
as early as last summer , when he dared question the strength of @entity13 ’ ambition at @entity21 , the @entity27 - winning coach was left in no doubt about who is actually in charge at @entity34			1
the beginning of a remarkable journey : @entity1 clutches @entity37 and @entity13 after seeing off the challenge of @entity39 in last year 's @entity27 he told you so : how @entity41 broke the story in wednesday 's @entity43 when he was finally appointed ‘ manager and first - team coach ’ , 25 days after landing club football ’s greatest prize in @entity49 ’s @entity48 , @entity1 presented @entity7 with a list of summer transfer targets			1
@entity52 , the free - scoring striker with 36 goals in 50 appearances for @entity55 in his first season in @entity57 , was at the top of it			1
but before @entity21 ’s manager could even make a case for the @entity63 striker he was cut short			1
@entity7 told him he already had a world - class finisher and the message was clear : @entity13 was to play			1
it was a message that was repeated on an almost daily basis			1
that was life at @entity21 for @entity1 , operating under almost intolerable conditions long before he axed @entity13 ahead of the shocking 3 - 0 defeat against @entity75			2
he knew he had to select @entity13			2
it was the owner ’s wish			2
but he also knew there were problems using @entity13 when the players @entity7 had brought in did not suit the @entity82 ’s style of play			1
a round peg in a square hole : @entity13 is said to be unhappy and @entity21 and his attributes do not suit the club 's style of play @entity1 had run the analysis on @entity13 , asking the club ’s technical team for a breakdown of the 81 goals he scored for @entity95 before his move south to @entity97			1
when @entity1 went through the detail , a worrying pattern emerged that convinced him @entity21 did not have the personnel to accommodate his game			2
were @entity21 right to sack @entity1 ? were @entity21 right to sack @entity1 ? now share your opinion at @entity106 , 56 of his goals ( 69 per cent ) were engineered by defence - splitting passes , usually from @entity110 or @entity111			2
at @entity21 , players like @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 — together with new arrivals @entity118 and @entity119 – preferred to pass their way through the opposition			2
they did not spring opposition defences and @entity1 was already beginning to doubt whether @entity13 was committed to the @entity21 project			2
@entity1 ’s relationship with technical director @entity125 was already strained , but it was stretched to the limit by the pressure to get @entity13 among the goalscorers			2
some sympathised , but others were openly questioning the motivation of a striker who was once regarded as the best finisher in world football			2
over bar the shouting : @entity1 patrols the touchline at the @entity137 , aware that his time at @entity21 is up upstairs in his office at the club ’s @entity142 training centre and puffing on cigarettes out on the balcony , @entity1 frequently discussed @entity13 ’ form with assistants @entity147 and @entity149			2
it hardly helped that the £ 50million striker had confided in team - mates that he was unhappy at the club , even saying as much to a @entity57 journalist on the night @entity21 lifted the @entity27			2
but a new season amounted to a new start for @entity1 and @entity7 was quick to apply the same approval index rating he uses to judge every manager — @entity27 progress			1
the day after @entity21 drew 2 - 2 with @entity75 in the opening fixture in @entity161 , when goals from @entity163 and @entity164 secured a point for the @entity166 , @entity7 arrived unannounced at the training ground			1
he asked @entity1 , his coaching staff and some of the players if they still had the desire for another crack at the competition after last season ’s incredible triumph			2
by 3am on wednesday , @entity1 was clearing the decks of his spacious office after being sacked at the training ground by chairman @entity178 and chief executive @entity179 , just over an hour after they arrived back from defeat in @entity4			2
the man of the moment : six months ago , @entity1 steered @entity21 to their first @entity27 he knew it was coming , saying farewell and shaking hands with the players in the dressing room at the @entity137			1
£ 86m : @entity21 have spent approximately £ 86million since 2004 in compensation for managers — more than @entity192 ’s entire net spend since the @entity190 began			2
8 months : the average life span for a manager under @entity7			1
only @entity195 and @entity196 lasted more than a year			0
9 : @entity7 has now had as many managers in his nine - year reign as @entity199 have had since 1937			1
7 : @entity21 have sacked seven managers since 2005 and won seven trophies			0
these were private moments and a significant number of the team apologised to @entity1 for failing to recreate the spirit that led to @entity206 and @entity208 glory last season			0
three days earlier , in the dressing room at @entity212 , the fingers had been pointed by the players in a post-match inquest following the 2 - 1 defeat			1
@entity149 , the assistant manager , had arrived at the ground with a black eye and a cut underneath his left cheek			0
after the fireworks that followed the final whistle , it is a wonder there were no further casualties			0
@entity21 ’s season was beginning to fall apart and the situation was irretrievable even then			0
@entity7 had to be talked out of firing @entity1 on saturday by his close circle of advisors , but the @entity27 clash with @entity75 was the tipping point			1
on sunday the players came in for a warm - down at @entity142 and flew on a delayed flight to @entity4 on monday after @entity1 held a short meeting with coaching staff			0
the impossible job : @entity1 takes charge of his final @entity21 training session in @entity4 in @entity4 , @entity21 ’s players picked up on @entity1 ’s distress and it transmitted to the squad in a subdued and sometimes directionless training session at @entity75 ’s stadium on monday evening			0
they knew he was about to make a tactical switch , but the message was muddled and there was uncertainty among the players as they chatted in hushed tones over dinner in the team hotel			0
in the team meeting at lunchtime on tuesday , when @entity1 announced that @entity119 would play up front instead of @entity13 , this was met with the tacit approval of many of the players			0
on the field they failed spectacularly , however , and @entity1 , who spent 45 minutes talking to his @entity166 advisor in the tunnel after the defeat , knew the game was up			0
as they all got on the airport bus which delivered them to their @entity267 flight — which finally took off at 1.45am from northern @entity166 — the atmosphere was tense			0
by that point @entity1 and @entity147 , both in sharp , grey suits , were hanging on for grim life as the bus , with @entity178 and @entity179 in attendance , made the short trip to the aircraft steps			0
ruthless : @entity7 wielded the axe for the seventh time since 2005 @entity278 giggled a couple of times			1
@entity281 , a decent guy , made small talk with the kit men			0
@entity284 , who was reading a book entitled @entity286 ( legend ) on the trip out to @entity4 , fiddled with his phone			1
@entity1 knew that his number was up , unable to motivate a striker who has scored just four goals in the @entity190 this season			0
even @entity13 ’ solitary @entity27 strike was a fluke , a ricochet that somehow rebounded into the net of @entity298 in the 3 - 2 victory over @entity300 on november 7			0
@entity301 under - estimated the owner ’s obsession with winning silverware			0
@entity7 has not forgotten @entity195 gesturing to him at @entity305 , counting the trophies with his fingers when @entity21 won the @entity206 in 2007			1
@entity21 started this season with a chance to win seven trophies , but the champions of @entity312 had already surrendered the @entity313 against @entity314 and were soundly beaten by @entity55 in the @entity315 in @entity316			0
@entity7 , who rarely travels to away games because he does not like to conform to stuffy boardroom etiquette by wearing a suit , became increasingly agitated as @entity1 ’s summer target finished them off with a hat - trick			1
@entity52 was fantastic that night			0
golden boot : @entity52 was in sensational form as the @entity55 striker hit a hat - trick in @entity316 @entity1 ’s team were also adjusting to a refined playing system as they encouraged @entity281 to throw the ball out to his back four instead of launching it forward from his penalty area			1
off the field @entity1 skilfully and diplomatically handled delicate situations , especially after @entity333 was banned by the @entity206 for four games and fined £ 220,000 for racially insulting @entity335			0
the incident did not even happen on @entity1 ’s watch — @entity338 was manager at the time — but the @entity166 attempted to protect the reputation of the club			0
even last sunday , his preparations for the trip to @entity4 were disrupted when @entity278 was unexpectedly called to an interview with the @entity206 over the allegations against referee @entity346			1
suddenly the @entity206 ’s compliance team were swarming all over the training ground again , taking @entity116 , @entity115 and @entity113 into neutralised zones for hours of taped interviews			0
casting a shadow : @entity1 felt the race row , involving referee @entity346 ( centre ) and @entity116 ( right ) had an impact on recent results @entity1 has deep reservations about @entity21 ’s complaint , and , naturally , believes that it has affected their recent results			1
they made the allegation two hours after they were beaten 3 - 2 at @entity34 by @entity199 , finishing the game with nine men after the dismissals of @entity13 and @entity37			0
since then they have picked up two points from the last 12 in the @entity190 and require something of a miracle to avoid the humiliation of exiting the group stage of the @entity27			0
that brutal reality dawned on @entity1 when @entity21 arrived back at the training ground in the dead of night after the @entity4 trip			0
@entity13 was one of the first off the bus , jumping straight into his car and slipping on his tracksuit top to beat the near - freezing temperatures			0
by then , @entity1 knew it was time to get his coat .			0

*suffocated* by @entity7 's *diktat* on always playing @entity284
*wrestling* to control a volatile and powerful dressing room
*constantly* *distracted* by the racism dispute with @entity346
