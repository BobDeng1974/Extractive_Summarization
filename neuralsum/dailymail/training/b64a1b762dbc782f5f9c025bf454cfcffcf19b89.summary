@entity1 manager @entity0 is relaxed about @entity3 's future despite reported interest from @entity5			1
the @entity6 are trying to tie the 20 - year - old to a new long - term contract and can ill - afford to lose their next potential world - class star following the departure of striker @entity11 to @entity12 in the summer			1
' hopefully it is not going to be the case			0
we are trying to build something here , ' said @entity0			2
@entity1 want to tie down @entity18 forward @entity3 to a new long - term contract ' we were on a path for a couple of years and we have had to come off that path since the summer having lost some players and have had to regroup			1
' he is a real talisman for this team			0
he has been a great example of the progress that a lot of the players have made here			0
' he has gone from a youth team player to one of the top young players in @entity34 football			0
' the club , i am sure , will work very hard ( on his contract ) and @entity3 is happy here , he loves being a @entity1 player			1
@entity3 has been attracting interest from @entity42 champions and @entity44 favourites @entity5 ' i am sure between them and the representatives we can get a deal done which will see him go on to continue to develop what is an exciting career			2
' i will never be surprised teams will be linked with @entity3 as he is such a big talent at 20 , a wonderful young player , but i am quite relaxed about it			2
' @entity3 found himself in the spotlight for the wrong reasons at the weekend after missing @entity1 's best chances in the 3 - 0 defeat at @entity60			1
@entity0 insists the youngster is not being affected by the debate over his future			1
@entity3 is thwarted at @entity64 once again by @entity60 goalkeeper @entity65 ' i think @entity3 has been brilliant , absolutely outstanding , ' added @entity0 , ahead of a crucial @entity67 quarter - final at @entity69 leaders @entity70			1
' the kid 's played in a front role for me at the weekend - a role he has played before as a youngster - but i do n't think it is affecting him one bit			0
' ok , he maybe could have got a goal or so but he puts defenders on the back foot , he is intelligent in his game , has running ability , and is getting himself into some wonderful positions			0
@entity0 is coming under increasing pressure at @entity1 after a woeful start to the season ' the kid has been a real catalyst for us in terms of our attacking threat so i do n't think there is anything which has affected him			2
' he leaves his representatives to work with the club to hopefully organise the deal for him and he has no real influence in that			0
' all i ask him to do is concentrate on playing football and the performances will come and he has shown consistently he has been a real threat			0
