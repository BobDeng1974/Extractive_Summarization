it may lay claim to being the ' @entity2 ' , a magical kingdom ruled by fairytale princesses and the like , but even @entity2 was still built with bricks , mortar and hard graft			0
the only theme park to have been completely overseen by @entity9 himself , @entity11 , celebrates 60 years in 2015 and extensive celebrations are planned			1
a time - lapse video from the @entity9 archives reveals how the park , which forms half of the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , was built from nothing before its opening on july 17 , 1955			1
@entity22 at the original @entity2 in @entity18 , @entity19 , emerges from scaffolding the castle at the first @entity25 , with imitations at all other parks since , in @entity2 in @entity18 the fun park , the only one of its kind to be fully overseen by @entity9 , opened on july 17 , 1955 the site was bought in 1953 with construction beginning in 1954 and the grand opening the year after that @entity35 is lifted into place in front of the futuristic @entity39 attraction from an expanse of brown dirt , iconic features such as @entity39 's @entity35 are raised into place while @entity22 emerges like a turbo episode of @entity45			1
other original features rising from the earth include the @entity49 's clock tower , the shell for jungle - themed adventureland and rocky @entity53 throwback @entity54			0
looking down @entity55 to the original @entity25 , @entity22 forms perhaps the most iconic image of the park , which emerges like a mini-town in @entity59			0
later years have seen the introduction of @entity61 in 1966 , @entity62 in 1972 and @entity63 in 1993 , followed by an entirely new @entity64 in 2001 - together they are now known as @entity17			0
the view down @entity55 as final building and cosmetic works are completed in 1955 what @entity49 looks like today as millions continue to stream through the gates every year the time - lapse video of the creation of @entity2 looks like a turbo version of grand designs while the idea had been in his thoughts for some time , @entity9 did n't muck about with the making of the park - purchasing a 160 - acre site in 1953 , beginning construction in 1954 and opening the year later			1
although it was supposed to have been unveiled in a press preview day with about 14,000 invitees on sunday , july 17 , 1955 , that opening saw 28,000 people go through the gates due to thousands of counterfeit ticket sales			2
the whole affair was televised and not a good look for the company , with a series of bloopers during the coverage by @entity94 , who partly funded the project			0
@entity55 is an expanse of dirt as a mini-town emerges in @entity59 , @entity19 the first thousands of guests flood through the gates at @entity2 , the original @entity9 fun park far from the fantasy @entity9 would have hoped for it was labelled internally as ' black sunday ' after a number of operational mishaps that range from chaotic queues to a gas leak in @entity25 that closed @entity25 , @entity54 and @entity108 for the afternoon			1
but it was merely a minor setback for what is now @entity9 's @entity113 division which now overseas @entity18 's @entity17 , @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , a fleet of cruise liners and a host of hotels			2
and just like the end of this timelapse , which show the first guests arriving in @entity18 , millions continue to flood through the turnstiles - more than 130 million a year , in fact .			0

@entity2 in @entity19 celebrates its 60th *anniversary* in 2015
the first @entity2 was opened in @entity18 on july 17 , 1955
