@entity0 produced save after save in another match - winning performance for @entity3 on sunday as their old rivals @entity4 were swept aside 3 - 0			1
the @entity8 keeper 's prowess in one - on - one situations and also his outstanding reactions and shot - stopping left @entity12 and @entity13 infuriated at @entity14			1
@entity16 's class is n't in doubt , but where does he rank among the world 's best right now ? we count down our top 10			1
feel free to add your list in the comments section below			0
@entity31 ( @entity30 and @entity32 ) his excellent performances for surprise package @entity32 at the @entity35 earned @entity31 a move from @entity37 , where he had also impressed , to @entity30			2
though he is playing second fiddle to @entity40 for now , @entity38 is clearly a capable stand - in and one for the long - term			0
@entity31 makes a penalty save from @entity46 's @entity45 while playing for @entity32 at the @entity35 9			2
@entity47 ( @entity48 and @entity49 ) these may be far from vintage times for @entity48 but in @entity52 stopper @entity47 they have a well - regarded and consistent performer			2
penalty saves are a speciality , with five in @entity57 and one in the @entity59 this season			0
@entity47 ( right ) jumps for the ball with @entity63 's @entity62 during a recent match at @entity65 8			0
@entity67 ( @entity66 and @entity68 ) long considered the heir - apparent to @entity70 , @entity67 continued to wait his turn on the international stage while excelling for his club , @entity66 , who dominated the @entity76 league last season and are looking for an extended run in the @entity79 this time round			0
@entity67 in action for @entity66 at @entity82 over the weekend 7			0
@entity40 ( @entity30 and @entity83 ) it looked for a while as though it might all be over for the legendary @entity83 keeper when he lost his place in @entity30 's team for league matches two seasons ago			0
but he responded by helping them to a 10th @entity79 crown			0
and , hey presto , he 's back to being no 1 for this campaign			0
@entity40 is approaching 700 career appearances for his one club and also has 160 caps for @entity83 - and he 's still top class			0
@entity40 lifts the @entity79 after @entity30 's 4 - 1 win over @entity100 in @entity101 back in may 6			2
@entity103 ( @entity102 and @entity76 ) while @entity102 's season may not be going entirely to plan , @entity103 has preserved his reputation as one of the world 's best keepers			1
maybe it 's a sign of their vulnerable defence that @entity103 has had to make more saves this season than many of the others in this list but he 's made them nonetheless and won many points as a result			1
@entity103 makes a flying save for @entity102 in a @entity59 match against @entity122 5			1
@entity70 ( @entity123 and @entity68 ) it is 13 years since @entity70 's big money move to @entity123 and yet the 36 - year - old retains his class and influence for both club and country			2
just look at the stats : @entity70 has kept 10 clean sheets in 14 league matches for @entity123 this season , the second highest in @entity136 's top leagues , and he has conceded just five goals in those games			0
he 's been performing to the highest standards throughout the 727 club matches and 146 appearances for @entity68 and long may it continue			0
@entity70 celebrates after @entity123 secured their place in the @entity79 knockout round 4			0
@entity145 ( @entity146 and @entity147 ) his abilities were called into question last season as a couple of high - profile mistakes saw him replaced by @entity153 in @entity146 's line - up			1
but @entity145 was n't deterred and has roared back to form , making crucial , match - defining saves to keep his team in contention in both the @entity159 and the @entity79			1
he also remains indisputably no 1 for @entity147 and this return to his best will be rewarded with a new long - term contract			0
@entity145 at full stretch to make a save during @entity146 's weekend win at @entity166 3			1
@entity167 ( @entity168 and @entity169 ) it seemed like @entity167 was waiting for ages for his chance at @entity168 , impressing consistently on loan for @entity100 and for his country @entity169 , but he 's seized it with both hands			1
with his maturity and well - honed shot - stopping skills , it 's often hard to forget that @entity167 is still only 22			2
as expected , he has replaced @entity180 as @entity168 's no 1 straight away and has n't put a foot wrong as @entity168 have set the pace in the @entity159			1
@entity167 rolls the ball out during @entity168 's @entity159 match with @entity166 earlier this season 2			1
@entity0 ( @entity3 and @entity83 ) the @entity8 keeper looked initially uncomfortable with the physicality of the @entity159 but has grown in stature , seeming to improve with every match			1
he has been absolutely indispensable to @entity3 this season and it 's no exaggeration to suggest they might be in the bottom half without him			2
@entity16 is excellent in one - on - one situations , as he proved against @entity196 on sunday , and has incredible reflexes to keep out shots , even at close quarters			0
will undoubtedly establish himself as @entity83 's no 1 in the future			0
@entity0 goes toe - to - toe with @entity146 striker @entity204 during the @entity206 derby 1			1
@entity207 ( @entity208 and @entity209 ) with his @entity35 winners ' medal and @entity213 nomination , few would argue that @entity207 is the world 's best stopper at the moment			1
he was a rock - solid presence for @entity209 , keeping four clean sheets and winning the @entity220 accolade for the tournament 's best keeper			2
that came off the back of another dominant season with @entity208 , who won a @entity227 and @entity228 double , as well as reaching the semi-finals of the @entity79			2
most impressive about @entity207 is that he has reinvented a role on the pitch , with his ' sweeper keeper ' approach that often sees him charge 30 or 40 yards from his line to mug opposing strikers of the ball			0
@entity207 makes a stunning one - handed save from @entity76 's @entity240 during the @entity35 @entity207 , in his role as sweeper keeper , comes out and tackles @entity244 's @entity243 @entity207 helped @entity209 to glory in the @entity35 and also won the @entity220 accolade for best keeper @entity247 here to @entity250 's facebook page .			1
