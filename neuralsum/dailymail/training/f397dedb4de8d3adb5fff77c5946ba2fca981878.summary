argument : @entity1 says his brother @entity3 's murder of @entity4 was ' inevitable ' and had an ' obvious ' justification the brother of one of @entity4 's murderers said today the attack on the soldier was ' inevitable ' and the justification for his death was ' obvious '			1
@entity1 , who like his now - convicted brother @entity3 is a muslim convert , predicted another @entity16 - style attack due to @entity18 's foreign policy			1
the 26 - year - old , who was banned from some of his brother 's trial for security reasons , also said that @entity24 was a violent man like his sibling			0
' i suggest that it wo n't be the last , simply because of the tactics of the @entity18 secret service and foreign policy			1
for every violent action is a violent reaction , ' he told @entity35 's @entity34			0
' is it justified for a @entity14 to attack a member of an army that is occupying @entity14 lands ? ' ' this is something for the scholars and i think it 's obvious to most people , ' he added			2
' the events to me were inevitable			0
there was eventually going to be another attack which mentioned foreign policy as its justification			1
' in the interview he claimed his brother 's actions were a direct consequence of the @entity55 's ' war on terror ' and likened the killing of @entity57 to @entity59 drone strikes on @entity14 countries			0
he said : ' i would say , was @entity4 a violent individual ? are other @entity18 soldiers who go to @entity63 and @entity64 and kill violent individuals ? ' ' the point he 's trying to make is the fact that the geographical location of the battlefield , since this war on terror , has basically disappeared			2
when we have people driving on roads in @entity63 and targeted by drones , we have to ask ourselves the question , are these people soldiers ? is this a battlefield ? ' he told @entity35 his brother was not radicalised , despite associations with radical preachers and the now disbanded group @entity84			0
he said : ' it 's a very tidy narrative to assume that we have this young @entity88 boy who was radicalised by these bogeymen - like figures - @entity90 , @entity91 - and while he went on this conveyor belt , as it were , of radicalisation and then the events of @entity16 happened			2
it 's just not true			0
' theory : @entity1 told @entity35 that his brother was a violent man but so was @entity4 because he was a soldier @entity1 claimed the @entity18 security services were aware of alleged mistreatment of his brother by @entity102 police while he was in custody in 2010 and added : ' they were complicit in allowing him to be interrogated with the means of interrogation that the @entity102 chose			1
questions are to be asked about why they allowed the @entity102 to torture a @entity18 citizen			0
' convert : married father - of - six @entity111 was arrested in @entity102 ( pictured ) seeking terror training but was allowed to return to @entity18 and kill @entity4 @entity1 said he has been approached by an @entity114 officer assigned to his brother , adding the security services were ' putting a lot of pressure ' on @entity1 and were ' really disrupting his life ' right up to ' a few months before ' the @entity16 attack			1
in 2010 @entity111 had tried to travel to @entity120 but was captured in @entity102 and brought back to the @entity18			1
@entity121 can now report it was a @entity122 unit that ‘ snatched ’ him as he prepared to enter the war - torn countries for terror training and to fight for the @entity126 linked terrorism group @entity127			0
but he never made it across the border and @entity102 officials believe he was arrested north - east of the resort of @entity132			2
sources say it was then that @entity114 ' tried to recruit ' @entity1 to inform them about other extremists for cash			1
referring to the links to the secret services @entity1 said during the trial : ' there 's a lot more to the story but i wo n't mention that			1
' a friend of @entity111 , @entity146 , told @entity147 that the claimed approaches by @entity114 became too much			1
he said : ' i think he felt that @entity114 were destroying his life and that his life as he knew it was over and he had no control over his own future and i think he wanted to take that control into his own hands rather than leaving it up to @entity114			2
' after he was brought back to @entity18 , he felt he was driven into a corner			0
' an @entity159 spokeswoman confirmed @entity1 was banned from the @entity160 ' for security reasons ' but this was later lifted .			0

@entity1 says @entity4 's murder had ' obvious ' justification
' the events were inevitable . there was eventually going to be another attack which mentioned foreign policy as its justification , ' he said
@entity111 arrested in @entity102 in 2010 and @entity114 ' tried to recruit him '
friend of killer says secret services ' destroyed ' his life before @entity16
