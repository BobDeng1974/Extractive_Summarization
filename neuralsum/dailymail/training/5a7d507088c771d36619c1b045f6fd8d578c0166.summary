by @entity0 published : 07:02 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 09:15 est , 5 march 2014 black bears living in @entity4 in @entity5 are shunning human food and returning to their natural diets , research has found			1
unlike @entity13 , the cartoon character famously known for his fondness for ' pic - a - nic baskets ' , the black bears are turning away from raiding visitor ’s supplies and going back to a natural diet , after years of dangerously high consumption of processed foods			2
after implementing strict rules and tough fines on storing food in the park , the percentage of human foods in @entity4 bears ’ diets has gone down from a 35 per cent high in the 1980s to just 13 per cent			1
bears for berries : after park management implemented restrictions on bears ' access to human foods , the @entity4 black bears have gone back to a natural diet by analysing hair and bone samples from bears living in the park , researchers at the @entity36 , @entity36 , were able to estimate how much of the @entity4 bears ’ diet was food sourced from humans			1
the percentage of human food in the bears ' diet increased proportionally to visitors ’ numbers until the late 90s , when a new strategy was implemented to reduce their access			1
management found that human foods led to aggressive and problematic behaviour among the bears and began to work on strategies to restrict the bears ’ exposure to it			0
the research found that the proportion of human foods in the bears ’ diets decreased by about 63 per cent after the new strategies was implemented in the late 90s			0
@entity66 - ly legal : after bears were given food to entertain visitors in the 1920s , they developed a taste for human treats and by the 1980s 35 per cent of their diet was ' non-natural ' since the new restrictions were put in place , the levels of human foods in the bears ' diets is now at a 1915 level ‘ @entity4 has a rich history of bear management practices as a result of shifting goals over the years , ’ @entity83 , lead author of the paper and a research fellow at @entity36 , said in a statement			1
‘ what we found was that the diets of bears changed dramatically after 1999 , when the park got funding to implement a proactive management strategy to keep human food off the landscape			2
’ unlike his real - life friends , @entity13 is hardly ready to give up on picnic baskets just yet mr @entity83 obtained bone and hair samples from bears killed from 1915 and onwards , including contemporary fur samples collected in @entity4			0
the average proportion of human food in bear diets for the period from 1915 to 1919 was 13 per cent , but this increased as management pandered to the visitors , making human food accessible to the bears so tourists could watch them feed			1
this got the bears used to human food , something which they taught their young and despite the last artificial feeding area closing in 1971 , the bears were addicted			0
they managed to find their own ways to get their paws on the goods , and between 1975 and 1985 , the percentage of human foods in their diets was 35 per cent			0
‘ the bears just went back to the camp grounds and hotels and continued to find human food , ’ @entity83 said			0
in 1999 , the new strategy , which includes using bear - resistant food - storage containers and establishing a ‘ bear team ’ to make sure visitors followed the rules on storing foods , was implemented and by 2001 , the numbers were down to 13 per cent			0
‘ the remarkable thing is that the bears that eat human food are now back to the same level of dumpster diving as in 1915 , despite the fact that there are now millions of visitors in @entity4 every year and presumably a lot more garbage , ’ the study ’s co-author @entity141 , a professor of @entity144 sciences and dean of physical and biological sciences at @entity36 , said .			2
