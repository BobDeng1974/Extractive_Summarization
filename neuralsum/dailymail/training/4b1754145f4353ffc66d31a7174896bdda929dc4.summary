a police officer whose ballistics evidence forms a key element of the murder case against @entity4 has been exposed as having presented misleading evidence to court			2
@entity8 forensics officer sgt. @entity7 was said to have provided @entity4 's murder trial with two contradictory explanations of how his wife was shot			1

a police officer whose evidence forms a key element of the murder case against @entity4 has been exposed as having presented misleading evidence			2
@entity25 , @entity4 , 30 , with murder vicitm @entity16 the officer examined the car in which @entity16 's body was found with a gunshot wound to the neck the second explanation - provided in another affidavit commissioned by @entity33 and submitted to the same court - claimed @entity16 was shot from a 25mm calibre , @entity36 - made semi-automatic pistol			1
while @entity4 's defence team conceded that @entity16 was shot with the @entity36 pistol , they argued that sgt. @entity7 's apparent willingness to provide contradictory stories indicates bias against their client			1
as defence barrister @entity48 explained , ' affidavits ' are not only meant to be legally binding statements of unambiguous fact , they should also be unique			0
@entity51 was shot dead on her november 2010 honeymoon to @entity8 when the taxi cab she and her husband were travelling in was hijacked but aside from the type of gun , both @entity7 's affidavits , the barrister claimed in court , are identical , even down to the positioning of the two documents ' signatures			1
what 's more , the digital ' metadata ' contained in an electronic version of one of the documents indicates it was created some 19 months after @entity33 claimed it to have been			0
' is it possible ' , the lawyer @entity48 asked the policeman , ' that one is a photocopy of the other ? could i put it to you that one crucial aspect was changed in one document and a copy of it was made ? that is what happened here			0
' sgt. @entity7 said he could not comment on this allegation			1
the twin affidavits were not the only pieces of questionable evidence @entity33 struggled to explain on the witness stand			0
the officer - who said he examined the car in which @entity16 's body was found - was asked about his evidence to the 2012 murder trial of @entity95 , the now dead hijacker found guilty of shooting @entity51			1
@entity7 agreed that while he had earlier told a court that @entity95 was likely to be @entity16 's killer , he did not have any conclusive data to support this conclusion			0
' how could you give your opinion when you were unaware of the necessary facts to say so ? ' @entity4 's lawyer asked			1
' maybe i did not understand ' , @entity7 replied			0
' you would agree that your answer could have misled the court ? ' the lawyer went on			0
@entity51 was shot dead on her november 2010 honeymoon to @entity8 when the taxi cab she and her husband were travelling in was hijacked as it passed through @entity114 's dangerous @entity113 township			1
sgt. @entity7 was asked about his evidence to the 2012 murder trial of @entity95 ( pictured ) , the now dead hijacker found guilty of shooting @entity51			1
so far three local men - including the taxi 's driver - have confessed to taking part in the murder plot , but they all claim they did so at @entity4 's behest			1
@entity125 , the only one of these three men present at the moment of @entity16 's killing claims she was shot by his accomplice @entity95 from the cab 's front left passenger seat			0
giving evidence yesterday , sgt. @entity7 initially confirmed that , in his opinion , @entity125 's story holds true and that @entity16 was likely to have been shot in the front passenger seat			1
under cross examination , however , the officer conceded that he based this opinion partly on measurements taken from a different car to the one used in the hijack and one in which the seats were positioned differently to the way they were during the hijack			0
@entity4 denies any involvement in the murder of his wife			2
the case will not sit tomorrow in order that both @entity16 and @entity155 ' families can celebrate the @entity157 festival of @entity158 ' what on earth did you , an expert , hope to achieve when you took measurements of a vehicle where the distances are nothing to do with the car in this case ? ' , @entity4 's apparently incredulous barrister asked the policeman , to an ambiguous response			2
later , when sgt. @entity7 refused to acknowledge that one of his own photographs - taken on tuesday this week and submitted as evidence later the same day - proved him to have taken inaccurate measurements , the lawyer @entity48 went further			2
' you are miles away from being an objective witness ' , @entity48 chided the policeman			0
' you do not want to concede that which an objective person - even a child - can see to be true			0
' ' it is patently clear that your previous evidence is false ' , to which sgt. @entity7 replied : ' it is not a matter that i wanted to mess up the case '			2
