beneath the regency splendour of @entity1 in @entity2 is a little - known tunnel that connects the square ’s private gardens to the seafront			1
when writer @entity7 used to visit @entity2 , the ivy - strewn tunnel fascinated him and , according to some , was the inspiration for the hole through which @entity12 fell in @entity13 , so starting her escapades with the @entity15 , @entity16 and the @entity17			1
now , 150 years since the publication of the children ’s classic , which will be marked with a number of special events , literary fans have the rare chance to buy a complete regency townhouse just above the tunnel			1
regency splendour : the @entity12 in the exclusive @entity28 in @entity2 the house , which inspired author @entity7 , comes with a west - facing balcony and a 65ft @entity32 rear garden the grade i listed five - storey property in exclusive @entity28 carries a £ 4.25million price tag , making it one of the most expensive homes ever to have come to market in the seaside city			1
@entity28 sits at the bottom of @entity1 on the seafront in the @entity44 area			0
the house itself was designed by @entity46 and @entity47 in the 1820s and built by @entity49			0
according to @entity51 , it is one of only a few @entity54 properties that has not been converted into flats , and it comes with access to the private gardens and incredible unobstructed sea views			0
musician @entity61 and his model wife @entity62 live nearby in @entity1 , and when fellow @entity64 @entity63 bought a house there in the @entity66 , the road had to be closed while an enormous new bath was winched into her home			1
@entity69 : £ 4.25million location : @entity44 , @entity2 bedrooms : six unique features : one of the city 's few regency houses , cinema room , @entity77 - operated lighting @entity78 , 59 , who owns the @entity28 property , says it was in a dilapidated state when he bought it with two business partners last january			1
the property developer adds : ‘ we befriended the former owner when we worked on a nearby property in 2010			0
he was an art dealer who had lived here for about 40 years			0
a large , vaulted room with roof lights at the top of the building was probably a former studio , but latterly he just lived on the lower ground floor			0
he loved the place and had no intention of moving , but he sadly passed away in january 2013			0
’ @entity78 has since brought the 4,600ft six - bedroom house up to date , adding a cinema room , steam room and state - of - the - art @entity101 lighting system that is operated via an @entity77			2
he even managed to gain permission to add a double - height glass conservatory			2
revamp : the grade i listed home 's modern kitchen maintains its intricate coving the ivy - strewn tunnel outside the home is said to have provided @entity7 with the inspiration for the hole @entity12 falls through at the start of the book there are grand @entity124 pillars at the entrance , four reception rooms , three bathrooms , a fantastic sweeping staircase , a west - facing balcony and a 65ft italianate rear garden			1
there are parquet floors throughout the ground floor , high ceilings , intricate coving and original fireplaces			0
the lower ground floor has underfloor heating and a huge family room , while the highlight of the first floor is the ‘ grand lounge and library ’ , which has three floor - to - ceiling @entity140 windows opening on to the large balcony			2
new skylights on the top floor flood the bedrooms with light and there are views from the back to the @entity150			0
explaining the high asking price , @entity78 says : ‘ it is like a new build dressed up in @entity154			0
none of the other complete regency properties has had such a thorough redevelopment			2
’ apart from the @entity12 connection , the property is rich in history , having been the original home of @entity163 girls ’ school			1
so who does @entity78 think the house will suit in the future ? ‘ we ’d love it to be a family house so that all of its many delights are fully used			0
however , it would just as easily suit being a weekend or holiday home			2
‘ it would be good if the buyer was from @entity2 , but they will more likely come from @entity178 or overseas			1
’ or maybe the new owner will be a big fan of @entity12 who fancies a new adventure down by the sea … @entity182 , 01273 683111			1
