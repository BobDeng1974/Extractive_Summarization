@entity8 accidentally flushed the gold band with seven diamonds down the toilet 18 months ago			1
despite her husband @entity13 disassembling the latrine and going into the plumbing under the house , the ring was nowhere to be found			2
she claimed the seven - diamond ring this morning at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , bringing with her a photo and the march 2001 appraisal from the jeweller that made it , kboi2.com originally reported			1
the ring cycle : @entity8 , third from left , has been reunited with her $ 6,000 engagement ring after she accidentally flushed it down the toilet nearly two years ago @entity31 : mrs @entity8 was able to claim the custom - made ring after bringing proof of ownership from the original jeweller mrs @entity8 thanked city workers @entity36 and @entity38 , who spotted the ring along with loose coins in a filtration basket while doing routine maintenance last week			1
mr @entity38 , who works alongside mr @entity36 as a sewer worker , told kboi.com that he originally thought the ring was a fake			2
‘ after i got it cleaned up , i could tell it was real , ’ he said			0
mr @entity36 added that the ring was the rarest find he ’s seen in the sewers			0
upon broadcasting the report of the found ring , people from around the country called them and tried to convince the workers the ring was theirs			1
‘ we were getting calls from states all over – even one from @entity60 , ’ @entity19 worker @entity57 told kboi2.com			2
good deed : @entity20 city workers @entity36 , left , and @entity38 found the ring and passed it on to @entity19 mrs @entity8 , who was alerted by a friend , was frantic to get her ring back			1
she rushed to the jeweller in @entity67 where she had the ring custom - made and requested a certificate to prove ownership			1
she says there was more screaming involved when she got a voice message from her friend relaying the news about a ring being found in the sewer in her old neighbourhood			1
mr @entity57 said the woman was all smiles when she arrived at @entity19 to claim her band			1
she took pictures with the two workers and thanked them sincerely			0

‘ miracles do happen , and i have my ring back , ’ she told kboi2.com			0
lord of the ring : the band was sealed in a manilla envelope until she claimed it the dramatic story started a year and a half ago when she was living in @entity20			1
she told @entity94 that the ring bounced into the toilet after she flushed			0
‘ i just started screaming , and i had my hand down in there too			0
’ ' miracles do happen , and i have my ring back			0
' - @entity101 her children , she said , did n’t see her cause for alarm			2
‘ my kids of course started laughing , because i ’m kind of klutzy like that			0
’ she said that despite its murky year and a half in the sewers , ‘ the diamonds are still sparkly as ever			0
’ still , she said that she ’s planning to get the ring cleaned professionally , and fix the band before she replaces her surrogate ring with the original			0
finding the ring was made possible in part because @entity20 has updated its sewer treatment in recent years			2
