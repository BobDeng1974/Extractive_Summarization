by @entity0 published : 11:41 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 13:25 est , 24 september 2013 a couple whose day - old baby died at a scandal hit maternity unit almost a decade ago have accused hospital staff of an ' unforgiveable cover - up ' of failings that led to her death			1
@entity9 was just 27 hours old when she died at the @entity10 in february 2004			1
though her death certificate stated she died of natural causes , the case was referred to the @entity14 in march of this year after a police investigation into a number of baby and mother deaths at the hospital			1
devastated : @entity22 and @entity23 have accused staff at @entity10 of an ' unforgiveable cover - up ' over the death of their baby daughter @entity27 an inquest held almost nine years after her death found that she died of ' as a consequence of complications during the birthing process			1
' the hearing at @entity34 heard that a midwife failed to take @entity27 's heartbeat for 43 minutes during labour and that she had to be resuscitated when she was finally born			1
she suffered continuous fits and was transferred to @entity39 but died in her father ’s arms the next day			2
although an internal investigation into @entity27 's death found failings by midwife @entity46 , the @entity23 family were never informed			1
coroner @entity47 today criticised the actions of @entity49 for failing to ' bite the bullet ' and not explaining to @entity22 and @entity23 how their daughter died			2
@entity54 's parents today called for the @entity55 to ensure a robust duty of candour is implemented so that the same mistakes do n't happen again			1
the two - day inquest was told that mrs @entity9 ’s third pregnancy went smoothly before she went into labour a week overdue			1
she had been classified as high risk because of her high body mass index and scans had showed it was anticipated to be a large baby			0
' cover up ' : coroner @entity47 was critical of the failure of @entity10 , pictured , to tell @entity69 and mrs @entity9 how their baby died following a damning internal investigation her waters were broken by a male registrar at 8.05pm on february 25 but he did not enter the maternity room again			1
ten minutes later , @entity27 's heartbeat was noted as being ' perfectly satisfactory			1
but despite national guidelines ruling that a baby 's heart rate must be checked every five minutes , @entity27 's was not monitored again by ms @entity46 for the next 43 minutes			1
when the midwife was unable to find a heartbeat via a cardiotocography ( @entity84 ) machine and a hand - held sonic aid device at around 8.45pm , she asked for help from a senior midwifery colleague			0
' an opportunity to get @entity27 out quicker was missed and obviously that was crucial to what happened			2
' coroner @entity47 the baby was born 13 minutes later , weighing 10lbs 10ozs , but had turned blue by the time she was placed on her mother 's stomach			2
coroner mr @entity47 criticised the staff for not immediately contacting the duty doctor and missing an opportunity to potentially save @entity27 's life			1
mr @entity47 said it was not as if the doctor was unavailable to assess the situation			0
he said : ' that would have given them the opportunity to get the baby out as soon as possible by whatever means you can whether through forceps delivery or caesarean			0
' that opportunity to get @entity27 out quicker was missed and obviously that was crucial to what happened			2
' he said it was ' most likely ' that @entity27 was starved of oxygen and suffered brain damage during the 43 - minute period she went unchecked			2
failings : an internal review carried out by the hospital 's then head of midwifery was ' thorough ' and ' pulled no punches ' according to the coroner , but @entity69 and mrs @entity9 were left in the dark the hearing was told that an internal review was carried out by the health trust in 2004 and criticised the actions of ms @entity46 , who was sent on a two - day training course , but the @entity128 were unaware of the investigation			1
the investigation , carried out by the hospital 's then head of midwifery @entity133 was ' thorough ' and ' pulled no punches ' , said mr @entity47			2
a memo written by @entity136 as part of the review stated if the case went to litigation then expert witnesses would certainly query the 43 - minute gap in the heart rate measurement			1
it went on that if she did not know that ms @entity46 was a competent and experienced staff member then she would have concluded ' there was negligence by omission '			0
' the consequence of all of that is we are all here today nearly 10 years later carrying out an investigation that should have happened eight or so years ago			0
' coroner @entity47 the coroner remarked : ' that is a very straight and damning piece of evidence which said there was a delay and there should not have been			0
' he added : ' i think someone should have bit the bullet and said ( to the @entity128 ) " we really need to level with you and let you know why @entity27 did not survive " and they did not do that			2
' the consequence of all of that is we are all here today nearly 10 years later carrying out an investigation that should have happened eight or so years ago			0
' the police probe into @entity27 's death was launched three months after an inquest in june 2011 held by the same coroner into the death of baby @entity178			1
mr @entity47 ruled @entity178 died of natural causes nine days after his birth at the hospital in october 2008 but that midwives had repeatedly missed opportunities to spot and treat a serious infection			2
speaking after the hearing , the @entity128 , from @entity185 , said : ' we were told that her death was one of those things and that no procedures could be changed to prevent it from happening again			0
scandal hit hospital : the police investigation into @entity27 's death begun after an inquest into the death of another baby , @entity178 ( pictured with sister @entity201 ) , who also died at @entity202 ' with the help of family and friends we tried to rebuild our lives for the sake of our other children			1
' in october 2011 , the police came to our door to tell us that they were investigating a number of deaths at @entity10 , and that @entity27 ’s was one of those cases			1
' since then , we have found out so much that was never revealed to us and this has totally devastated our entire family			0
we have had to restart the grieving process all over again			0
' we now have the truth about what went wrong that night and this means we can try again to move on as a family and @entity27 can now rest in peace			2
' we hope that lessons can be learned and that her death will not have been in vain			0
we urge the government to ensure that the duty of candour is implemented and robustly enforced within the @entity55			0
' our wish is that no family should have to go through what we have			0
' we understand that nobody meant for this to happen , but to lie , cover up the mistakes and fail to learn from them is unforgiveable			0
' @entity237 , medical director of @entity238 apologised to the family following the inquest and said that lessons had been learned			0
he said : ' we extend our sincere condolences to baby @entity9 's family			1
for any family to lose a loved one is an absolute tragedy and having to revisit a very painful time from 2004 is extremely difficult			0
' we understand that nobody meant for this to happen , but to lie , cover up the mistakes and fail to learn from them is unforgiveable			0
' @entity22 and @entity23 ' our heartfelt sympathy goes out to them			0
' we acknowledge that full information was n't shared with the family at the time of @entity27 's death and we apologise for this			1
' we have now improved our systems to ensure that in similar circumstances , information is shared with the family concerned as soon as possible			0
' we have accepted that some of the care provided to mrs @entity9 in 2004 during the course of her labour and delivery was inappropriate and that steps should have been taken to deliver @entity27 sooner			1
' we fully accept the coroner 's conclusion that @entity27 died as a result of complications during the birthing process , and we are sincerely sorry for this			1
' ' during the last 12 months significant progress has been made with a new @entity275 in place and clinicians leading changes in the way we operate			0
' a new clinical leadership team for our maternity services has a clear vision of providing safe and excellent care which will meet the needs and expectations of mothers and babies			0
