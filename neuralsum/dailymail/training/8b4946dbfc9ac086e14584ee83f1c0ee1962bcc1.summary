by @entity0 published : 14:02 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 10:21 est , 30 july 2013 with their ridiculous fur hats , conspicuous sunglasses , absurd facial hair and awkward catalogue poses , you 'd be forgiven for laughing at these cringe - worthy retro pictures			1
but the reality behind the images is horrifying			0
these are agents of the dreaded @entity11 , @entity13 's startlingly effective secret police that turned the @entity15 country into a paranoid dystopia			1
the pictures show how agents dressed in an effort to remain inconspicuous as they attempted to invade the privacy of suspected dissenters and gather evidence , before ruthlessly interrogating them - often for days on end			1
the banality of evil : two of the outfits agents of the @entity11 would have employed as they went about their repressive work			1
ironically , the outfit on the right makes the agent look like a stereotypical movie spy they were also a photographic record of how their agents would have dressed when undertaking @entity39 missions to the hated @entity40			1
some of the disguises seem laughable to us now			0
one of the images , featured on @entity44 , shows a stereotypical tourist disguise laden with cameras , shades , a hat and garish red trousers			0
another shows what could be a student , complete with cut - off jean shorts and a backpack			0
the @entity11 fashion collection was extensive			1
the agency sent thousands of spies into @entity57 and had access to vast amounts of cash to buy western goods to equip agents with			0
blending in ? the extraordinary images form part of the @entity11 secret police course on the ' art of disguising ' while the pictures are amusing , the sinister purpose of the disguises should be considered the extent of @entity11 snooping is seen in other photos in the book			1
they include snapshots agents took of houses before they were to be searched for contraband or material ' harmful to the state			0
' the @entity11 always took photos of rooms they ransacked so they could put everything back in its place and the victims would not know they had been to visit them			1
the photos were found in the miles and miles of paperwork found in @entity11 offices across @entity13 that the agency 's shredders and furnaces did not have time to destroy in the hours and days following the collapse of the regime in 1990			2
@entity13 artist @entity98 spent two years poring over materials from the archive of the federal commissioner for the @entity11 of the @entity13 for his forthcoming book @entity103 : images from the @entity11			2
this range of casual decor was likely employed on a mission to the democratic , capitalist west the photos were found in the miles and miles of paperwork found in @entity11 offices across @entity13 the artist amassed the images over a period of two years			2
he pored over materials from the archive of the federal commissioner for the @entity11 of the @entity13 he says he aims to show ' the act of surveillance from the perspective of the surveillant '			1
' many of the images reproduced here might appear absurd or even funny to us , ' he said			0
' but it is important not to lose sight of the original intentions behind these pictures			0
they concern photographic records of the repression exerted by the state to subdue it own citizens			0
' for me , the banality of some of these pictures makes them even more repulsive			1
' to see more of mr @entity140 work , take a look at his website @entity144 the former @entity13 secret police ' @entity11 ' headquarters in @entity147 the @entity13 â€™s @entity11 ( @entity11 ) was one of the most effective surveillance apparatuses ever			1
proportionally to the size of its population , the @entity150 had far more agents working for it than the @entity156 or the @entity157			2
the @entity11 turned one in three of the 17 million people of the @entity13 into an informant			2
children sneaked on their parents at school , wives informed on husbands , lovers betrayed one another			0
additionally , @entity11 agents infiltrated and undermined @entity57 's government and spy agencies			1
the @entity11 often broke the will of the victim by targeting their private or family life			2
this often included breaking into homes and messing with the contents smear campaigns , denunciation , provocation , psychological warfare , psychological subversion , wiretapping , bugging , mysterious phone calls or unnecessary deliveries			0
usually victims had no idea the @entity11 were responsible and some suffered mental breakdowns or even committed suicide			1
the @entity11 employed one full - time agent for every 166 @entity13			2
the @entity11 had one informer per 6.5 people			0
by comparison , the @entity194 employed one secret policeman per 2,000 people			0
when @entity13 collapsed in 1989 , the @entity11 had 102,000 employees .			0

ridiculous pictures hide a dark and terrifying reality
the fashion victims are actually deadly and powerful @entity11 agents
they kept the population in line with ruthless and *invasive* surveillance
the man who collected them said their ' banality ' makes them ' repulsive '
