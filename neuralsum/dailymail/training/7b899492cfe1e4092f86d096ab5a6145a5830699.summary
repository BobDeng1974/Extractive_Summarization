by @entity1 reporter published : 06:58 est , 17 january 2014 updated : 06:58 est , 17 january 2014 the social media craze for ' neknominating ' has reached a new high with a video showing two men quaffing beers while hanging from a helicopter			2
the footage uploaded to @entity9 shows the pair clutching the skids of a helicopter while downing a bottle of @entity14 each as it hovers several dozen feet above a lake			1
neither man is wearing a safety harness and only one is wearing a helmet , which is apparently so that he can mount a camera rather than out of any safety considerations			0
reckless : stills from the video which shows two men quaffing bottles of @entity14 while hanging from the skids of an airborne helicopter in the latest escalation of the ' neknomination ' social media drinking game helicopter : the props involved in this particular necknomination stunt may make it a difficult one to beat it is the wildest ' neknomination ' video yet seen after the social media drinking game emerged			1
the fad encourages participants to film themselves ' necking ’ liquor , then nominate a friend to do the same			0
they then try to outdo each other creating more extreme , disgusting and outlandish videos			0
those who refuse to participate risk losing face among their peers			0
the new video begins with two young men driving in a @entity47 somewhere in the outback and explaining that they have been nominated			2
they arrive at a farm , where they leap from the sports car and run to a waiting helicopter that is already hovering several feet above the ground			0
grabbing hold of its skids , they hang on for dear life as it lifts then into the air and carries them to a nearby lake where a person aboard the aircraft hands them each a bottle of @entity14			1
each man then holds on with just one arm as they both down the bottles of @entity73 - brewed beer			1
finally , they let go of the helicopter and plunge into the waters below			0
@entity77 : the new video begins with two young men driving in a @entity47 somewhere in the outback splash down : it ends with them letting go of the helicopter and plunging into the waters below the hashtag ' neknominate ' started trending in the @entity86 in january 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world , however it seems to have recently found a large following amoung young males in @entity73			1
the concept of the game has been described by a user on @entity93 as : ' neck your drink			0
do n't break the chain , do n't be a dick			0
the social drinking game for social media ! # neknominate			0
one popular video shows a bare - chested man emptying a bottle of beer down the toilet before two friends lower him head - first into the porcelain bowl to lap it up			1
another video shows a young man get punched , beaten with sticks , have firecrackers thrown at him and his pants set alight , as he guzzles beers and shots			1
a third shows a group of apres - ski partygoers downing beers that have first been poured into someone 's sweaty ski boot			2
another @entity121 pours beer into a toilet to prepare for the disgusting drinking challenge ( left )			0
he is then lifted into the toilet by two friends to skoll the beer ( right ) a young @entity73 man pours an alcoholic mixture into a boot ( left )			1
he is then filmed skolling the concoction and nominates friends to do the same ( right ) the trend has reached the apres - ski scene in @entity135 , where legendary bar the @entity136 sees partygoers like ' @entity139 ' , pictured , remove a ski boot and use it to down pints of beer the boot - or ' @entity144 ' as it is fondly called - is passed around the group who then have to down the increasingly foul liquid this young man has fireworks thrown at him and his shorts set alight ( left ) as he skolls beers and drinks a number of shots			1
he is also repeatedly punched and beaten with sticks throughout the video violent : throughout the clip the young man is punched in the face by a man wearing body armour and boxing gloves while being made to drink beer and a number of shots the man 's friends look on and laugh as he is filmed being attacked while downing a number of drinks but the competitive nature of the game has authorities worried as nominees are encouraged to go further and be more extreme in their videos			1
director of the @entity174 's @entity173 , professor @entity175 , has expressed his concern on the trend saying it could turn deadly			2
‘ it 's like jackass and that type of wild behaviour , and it 's not necessarily very impressive , ’ he told the @entity178			0
‘ the main issue is the question of scale and context			0
in general it looks like it could get people into a lot of trouble , with a lot of pressure to drink			2
it 's competitive , heavy drinking , and that tends to end up with people coming to serious grief through alcohol poisoning			2
it is n't a thing to be encouraged at all , ’ he said			0
police in @entity73 have questioned a 21 - year - old man after a video showed him getting out of the boot of a car , downing a drink , then climbing back in			1
another trend concerning authorities is ‘ skidnominate ’ , a dangerous escalation of the drinking game where participants film themselves doing burnouts and skids in their cars .			1

@entity9 clip shows them clutching skids while downing bottles of @entity14
it is the wildest stunt yet seen in *quickly* escalating ' neknominating ' trend
@entity225 has become increasingly popular among young @entity73 males
but it is believed to have started in the @entity86 in the early part of last year
