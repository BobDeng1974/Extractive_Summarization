questions were being asked last night about the effectiveness of @entity3 screening after it emerged the infected nurse had been vetted twice			1
the woman was screened in both @entity7 and @entity8 but her symptoms were not detected			1
professor @entity10 , an expert in molecular virology at @entity12 , said the case showed the procedure was unable to spot @entity3			1
the woman was screened in both @entity7 and @entity8 but her symptoms were not detected he said this was because symptoms such as a high temperature can take up to three weeks to develop			2
' when [ screening ] was introduced it was more a measure of reassurance rather than something that actually worked , ' he said			2
' because the incubation period for @entity3 is up to 21 days , it 's impossible to detect as you do n't show symptoms			1
' in october , ministers were accused of a chaotic response to the @entity3 crisis when it emerged screening measures amounted to little more than a questionnaire			1
the tests involve assessing passengers ' recent travel history and who they have been in contact with , as well as a possible medical assessment			0
passengers who have come from @entity7 , @entity41 or @entity42 are put in a separate queue at customs			0
in a holding area , they are asked how they are feeling , whether they have been in contact with @entity3 victims and if they have touched bush meat			1
if the medical staff are concerned , they start a full assessment			0
but they stop short of screening passengers with thermal guns to pick out those with an elevated temperature , a procedure adopted in the @entity57			0
questions were being asked last night about the effectiveness of @entity3 screening after it emerged the infected @entity63 nurse had been vetted twice health chiefs will be disturbed that the nurse was able to travel on a plane after developing symptoms			1
spreading from person to person as a result of direct contact with skin or bodily fluids such as blood or sweat , the deadly virus is extremely infectious			1
however the afflicted nurse 's fellow passengers on her flight to @entity8 are unlikely to have contracted it because it is not airborne			0
they would not be at risk from breathing the same cabin air and it would be exceptionally unlucky to catch it from an armrest , a touch - screen television or a seat - back tray			0
but there will be concern over anyone who may have had close contact with the woman – such as her partner – and for any health officials who treated her after she became ill but before she was diagnosed			1
the virus can enter the body via infected droplets through broken skin or mucous membranes such as the eyes or the lining of the nose			2
ferociously infectious while inside a human body or bodily fluid , it is far less so on an inert surface where it lasts for no longer than a few minutes			2
but guidelines on tackling @entity3 say a carpet or seat cover that is dirty from blood or body fluids should be discarded in the same way as biohazardous material			1
precautions : @entity118 starts his journey home from @entity7 in an air isolation unit to avoid catching the disease , medical workers must wear goggles , incinerate clothing and clinical waste and decontaminate medical equipment that needs to be kept			0
when she arrives at the @entity129 in @entity130 , north @entity8 , the health worker will be admitted through a specially - assigned hospital entrance , before being taken to the high - level isolation unit – the only ward in the @entity63 equipped to cope with ebola			0
it is the same unit that nursed fellow @entity63 nurse @entity118 back to health after he contracted @entity3 in @entity7 in august			1
the latest victim will occupy a £ 25,000 bed that will be burned after she leaves the hospital			0
an intravenous drip will pump saline solution into her body to stop the organs failing			0
doctors will also treat the bleeding from her nose , eyes and ears			0
if they can not get hold of experimental @entity3 drug @entity150 , they will simply try to manage the disease until her immune system is strong enough to fight it off			2
a filtration system will suck the air away , removing all contaminated vapour before it is pumped out of the building .			0
