the unprecedented drought currently afflicting @entity1 is ' very likely ' linked to human - caused climate change , researchers have found			1
they say a persistent region of high atmospheric pressure hovering over the @entity6 that diverted storms away from @entity1 was much more likely to form in the presence of modern greenhouse gas concentrations			1
it is one of the most comprehensive studies to investigate the link between climate change and @entity1 's ongoing drought			1
an irrigation canal that is drying up near @entity17 , @entity1 @entity1 's third year of drought ends tuesday sept. 30 and @entity1 @entity20 director @entity19 said it is essential to use water sparingly as the state faces the possibility of a fourth dry winter			1
the unprecedented drought currently afflicting @entity1 is ' very likely ' linked to human - caused climate change , researchers have found			1
the exceptional drought currently crippling @entity1 is by some metrics the worst in state history			2
combined with unusually warm temperatures and stagnant air conditions , the lack of precipitation has triggered a dangerous increase in wildfires and incidents of air pollution across the state			0
a recent report estimated that the water shortage would result in direct and indirect agricultural losses of at least $ 2.2 billion and lead to the loss of more than 17,000 seasonal and part - time jobs in 2014 alone			0
such impacts prompted @entity1 gov. @entity45 to declare a drought emergency and the federal government to designate all 58 @entity1 counties as ' natural disaster areas			2
' the report found that high - pressure ridges like the one that stubbornly parked itself over the @entity6 for the past two winters , blocking storms from hitting @entity1 , are much more likely to form in the presence of man - made greenhouse gases			1
the ridge , dubbed the @entity60 by researchers , or ' @entity62 , ' parched the state during the past two rainy seasons			0
' you can visualize it as a fairly large boulder in a small stream , ' said @entity69 , a lead author on the report , which said the phenomenon has caused storms to bypass not only @entity1 but also @entity72 and @entity73 , pushing rain as far north as the @entity75			1
using climate model simulations , the researchers found that ' @entity79 ' events are three times more likely to occur today than in preindustrial climates			0
@entity83 boats are docked at @entity86 's @entity85 resort near @entity87 , @entity1 after three years of drought the water level at the lake has dramatically receded			2
scientists also determined that as long as high levels of greenhouse gases remain , severe droughts could become more frequent			2
' @entity1 is more likely to see these episodes in the near term , ' said environmental scientist @entity97 , who led the study			2
despite the findings , @entity99 , principal scientist at @entity101 's @entity100 and one of the report 's editors , said it is still hard to definitively link rainfall to climate change			0
' there is so much variability in rainfall , ' @entity99 said			0
' finding a signal and attributing how much of the signal is climate change is difficult			0
' @entity115 , a research meteorologist with the @entity101 who edited some of the reports in the climate study , said atmospheric pressure has increased everywhere due to global warming , so the systems need to be studied in that context			1
' it 's not the pressure , per se , that determines which way the storms will move , ' @entity115 said during a press conference			0
' but it 's the difference of how the pressure changes from one location relative to another			0

persistent region of high atmospheric pressure hovering over the @entity6 diverted storms away from @entity1
@entity139 found it was much more likely to form in the presence of modern greenhouse gas concentrations .
