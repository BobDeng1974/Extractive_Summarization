the murder charges against @entity11 , 47 , and @entity12 , 48 , will be dismissed thanks to a lack of evidence pinning them to the 1987 crime			1
the case is expected to be officially dropped thursday by @entity19 , @entity21 circuit court judge @entity20 , the same judge who ordered the brothers be released after a quarter century in prison on august 13 , 2012 after new evidence warranted a retrial			1

@entity19 prosecutor @entity47 appealed the ruling to the state court of appeals , which declined to reverse it			2
the case was scheduled for trial on oct. 8			2
‘ just as we did 26 years ago , we firmly believe in the evidence in this case , ’ @entity47 said wednesday in a release			1
‘ we have worked diligently to bring this case to trial			2
with the passage of time it is an unfortunate reality that this case can not be put back together and we must dismiss it			1
’ the brothers got the news that their 26 - year - long saga was over from their attorney			1
@entity11 was at work while @entity67 was having lunch with his girlfriend			1
@entity70 hugs @entity33 , center , as @entity72 watches after they were released on bond pending a new trial from @entity76 in @entity6 in 2012 the brothers were convicted of killing a 65 - year - old drug dealer in 1987 , but a new witness came forward in 2012 discounting original testimony			1
this week , the @entity19 @entity81 decided not to retry justice : ' being able to correct an injustice , there ¿ s no greater feeling , ' defense attorney @entity86 said			2
' they would have died in prison			2
it ¿ s a testament to the human character that they hold no bitterness			0
' ‘ i ’m just elated , ’ @entity94 told the @entity95			0

the @entity12 brothers , now 47 , were convicted in 1988 in a non-jury trial of felony murder and assault with intent to murder			1
the case was reopened in march 2012 after a man came forward who said he was one of a few @entity126 graduates at @entity44 's house the night he was shot			1
@entity128 said he was scared at the time to say anything , and did n't learn for two decades that the @entity28 had been convicted			1
two of the former graduates testified in july 2012 that they went to @entity44 's back door to buy marijuana			1
they said they were interrupted by several armed black men who rushed into the backyard and ordered them to leave			1
prosecutors had questioned the witnesses ' credibility throughout the hearing , suggesting there was a conspiracy to free the @entity12 brothers			2
@entity47 's decision to seek a dismissal in the case came as a surprise to the brothers , according to @entity149 , defense attorney for @entity150			1
‘ we were geared up and ready for trial , ’ @entity149 told the @entity0 wednesday afternoon			0
we have all our witnesses lined up			0
that 's not to say that it should n't have happened			0
it should have been dismissed a long time ago			2

both have jobs , she said			0
‘ i do n't think you can ever make up for 20 years behind bars , ’ @entity149 added			2
‘ you ca n't give them back their lives			0
there is nothing that can make up for it			0
’ ' i ¿ m just elated , ' @entity30 , 48 , said			2

@entity6 brothers @entity11 and @entity150 , 47 and 48 , were *wrongly* convicted of a 1987 murder of a 65 - year - old drug dealer named @entity44
the men spent 25 years in jail and were released last year on bond pending a retrial after new evidence was *uncovered*
now , the men have learned they will be *fully* cleared of the charges after a year of *fearing* they might be convicted a second time
