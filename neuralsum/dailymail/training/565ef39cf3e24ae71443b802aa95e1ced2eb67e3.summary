a flourishing ecosystem has been found a mile and a half beneath @entity4 ice in a lake cut off from the outside world for millions of years			1
the discovery was made by @entity9 scientists who found tiny organisms that generate energy for growth from the natural ammonium and methane in the environment			1
this is the first direct evidence that life can be found deep below the @entity4 ice sheet and could have implications for finding life in extreme environments in our solar system			1
a flourishing ecosystem has been found a mile and a half beneath @entity4 ice in a lake that has been cut off from the outside world for millions of years			1
the discovery was made by @entity9 scientists who found tiny organisms that generate energy for growth from the natural ammonium and methane in the environment ' we were able to prove unequivocally to the world that @entity4 is not a dead continent , ’ said lead scientist professor @entity36 , from @entity37			1
many of the organisms found belong to a primitive extended family of microbes , distinct from bacteria , called the @entity42			1
the team drilled through half a mile of ice to reach the sub-glacial @entity45 in january last year			0
archaea form one of the three great ' domains ' of life on @entity49 , the other two being bacteria and eukayotes - organisms with their @entity52 contained in a cell nucleus - to which humans belong			2
many of the sub-glacial archaea survived by harnessing energy in the chemical bonds of ammonium , the research showed			0
the @entity9 team drilled through half a mile of ice to reach the sub-glacial @entity45 in january last year in march last year , scientists thought they had discovered new life forms sealed off for 14 millions years in a subglacial lake deep in @entity66 ice			2
scientists believed the icy darkness of @entity68 , under 3,700 metres of ice , could provide a glimpse of the planet before the @entity72 and clues to life on other planets			1
the @entity77 discovery came from analysing water that froze onto the end of the drill bit used to bore through to @entity68 - the largest of a network of hundreds of lakes under the ice cap that acts like a blanket trapping the @entity49 's geothermal heat			0
but the research at @entity87 has now been called into question due to potential contamination , primarily from hydrocarbon - based drilling fluid			0
another group of micro-organisms in the same area relied on the energy and methane locked into carbon to survive			0
the scientists insisted that the microbes originated in @entity45 and were not introduced by contaminated equipment			2
previous research at @entity87 , the largest subglacial lake in @entity4 , has been called into question due to potential contamination , primarily from hydrocarbon - based drilling fluid			2
' we went to great extremes to ensure that we did not contaminate one of the most pristine environments on our planet while at the same time ensuring that our samples were of the highest integrity , ' said professor @entity36			0
‘ because @entity4 is basically a microbial continent , exploring below its thick ice sheet can help us understand how life has evolved to survive in cold darkness , ’ said @entity110 from the @entity111 , who was also involved in the project			1
‘ i hope our findings motivate new research on the role of these extreme microorganisms in the function of our planet and other icy worlds in our solar system			0
’ the team drilled through half a mile of ice to reach the sub-glacial @entity45 in january last year			0

this is first direct evidence that life can be found below @entity4 ice
it could help scientists look for life in extreme environments in space
many of the organisms belong to primitive microbes called the @entity42
*studying* them could help scientists understand how life evolved to survive in cold darkness
