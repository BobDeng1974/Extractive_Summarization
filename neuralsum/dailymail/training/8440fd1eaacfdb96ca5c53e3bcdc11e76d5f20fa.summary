@entity1 's wonder try against @entity2 in @entity3 on sunday is unlikely to earn him an immediate @entity5 recall , but the @entity7 wing believes it will reignite his game after a difficult year			1
the 23 - year - old brought the house down at the @entity11 by leaving three opponents in his slipstream to produce a glorious solo strike in his club ’s @entity16 defeat			2
hours later , he was feted by @entity19 and @entity5 fans alike as he walked through @entity3 airport with his team - mates , but it is understood that his latest scoring feat has not convinced the @entity5 coaches to include him in their autumn test squad			1
@entity1 of @entity7 breaks clear to score a try against @entity2 but will not be recalled by @entity5 @entity27 has learned that @entity1 is due to be included in the @entity29 squad and will have to bide his time in the hope of winning a second international cap			1
but having missed most of last season with a foot injury which proved tough to overcome , the @entity33 feels that his try on sunday will serve to kick - start his game again			2
‘ i was really excited and happy to score , ’ he said			2
‘ scoring tries like that makes me feel like my old self again and that will give me real confidence going forward			2
i ’ve just got to play as much rugby as i can and see what else i produce			0
‘ for me it ’s been a difficult last year really			0
i had the injury and was out for about nine months			0
in the first few games i played after that i was obviously trying to feel my way back into it			1
i was n’t holding back , i was trying to do my best but i was making mistakes			1
i have kept trying to get better every week and put some good performances together			0
’ @entity51 @entity1 made his one and only @entity5 appearance against @entity54 in june last year recalling his blistering run to the line , @entity1 added : ‘ it was in broken - field play and the boys got it out to me			1
i had a bit of space and i think it was @entity64 who was in front of me			0
i had a one - on - one with him and i was able to stand him up , get on the outside and from there it was straight run – a race into the corner			0
‘ for wingers , our main job is to finish off tries and also to get over the gainline			0
that is something that i have always done but i know that i ca n’t just rely on scoring tries – i also have to have the right defensive mind - set			2
i know that as a winger i have to be good at defending , at the wide breakdowns , the high balls and the kick - chase			0
i have to make sure i get my all - round game right			0
’ @entity1 is destined to miss out when @entity88 names his autumn squad on wednesday			1
wing is among the most open areas of the field in terms of @entity5 selection , with @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 believed to be the leading four candidates , while @entity100 and @entity101 are also in the mix.			1

@entity1 burst back on to the scene with a wonder try for @entity7
his performance led to *suggestions* he would be recalled by @entity5
but @entity1 is set to be named in the @entity29 squad instead
