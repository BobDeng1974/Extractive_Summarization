by @entity0 published : 21:01 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 05:25 est , 13 august 2013 dame @entity1 said patients often felt too scared to complain about their @entity4 treatments patients who suffer poor hospital care are failed because complaints go unheard and lessons unlearned , the @entity8 has warned			1
dame @entity1 said patients often felt too scared to complain about their @entity4 treatments			1
she said : ‘ what we found was that there is a toxic cocktail – patients felt reluctant to complain , because they can fear it will affect the care they get			1
if they do , they are met with a culture of defensiveness , where they do n’t get the explanations they need and the opportunity is lost to learn really powerful insights			1
’ a report by the @entity8 is calling for sweeping changes so that more complaints are acted on quickly , and action is taken before care is threatened			1
the changes include access to a free patients ’ advice service 24 hours a day , each patient to be given the name of a senior person as the first port of call for concerns and a regular measure of feedback			2
@entity40 , a @entity41 mp whose husband suffered appalling failings in care , has submitted the recommendations to an independent review which is set to report next month			2
dame @entity1 told the @entity47 that hospitals often fail to learn lessons from even major tragedies , which were then more likely to be repeated			2
more than half of those who consider complaining about their treatment by the @entity4 do not do so , according to research			2
many are put off because they expect the process to be bureaucratic , while others believe it will make no difference			0
patients and carers contacted the @entity8 in desperation and frustration , @entity1 said , because hospital complaints departments had failed to provide even the most basic explanation , let alone an apology			1
a report by the @entity8 is calling for sweeping changes so that more complaints are acted on quickly ‘ there are three core things that people come to us about , ’ she said			1
‘ number one is – “ i just ca n’t get a decent explanation , i really do n’t know what happened and actually maybe if i had a proper explanation that would sort it for me – i just want to know ”			0
‘ the second is when something has gone wrong , but there is a lack of acknowledgement of mistakes , and inadequate apology			0
‘ the third is when there is insufficient remedy – i think what has really struck me about why the public complain is they do so because they want to prevent the same thing happening to someone else			0
’ a study by the @entity8 also found staff are reluctant to properly investigate complaints because they are afraid of challenging the @entity4 hierarchy , drawing attention to failings or they are worried about being punished for admitting to failings			1
‘ this defensiveness is one of the most important things we need to overcome – that is about changing the culture , not about the procedure , ’ @entity1 said			0
last month @entity1 promised a ten-fold rise in the numbers of cases which the ombudsman examines			0
a major review has called for @entity4 staff who ‘ wilfully ’ or ‘ recklessly ’ harm patients to face criminal penalties			0
it also demanded legal sanctions against @entity4 chiefs with a ‘ could n’t care less ’ attitude .			0

the @entity8 says complaints must be acted on quickly
