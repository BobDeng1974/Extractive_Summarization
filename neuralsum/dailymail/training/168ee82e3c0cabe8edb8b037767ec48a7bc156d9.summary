@entity0 will start @entity2 's second test against @entity3 on the wing in the biggest selection call of @entity7 's reign as head coach			1
driven by the need to bring as much firepower to bear as possible on the @entity3 , @entity0 will be shifted from outside centre to accommodate the established @entity13 partnership of @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity14 will be making his first appearance since damaging ankle ligaments six weeks ago while @entity15 returns after helping @entity18 claim the @entity20 title			1
wide threat : @entity0 moves to the right wing for the second test against @entity3 on saturday moving @entity0 on to the right wing opposite the prolific @entity25 , who has recovered from a knee problem , is a brave but exciting decision that has been under consideration for the past six to 10 months			2
the 23 - year - old last filled the position for @entity31 in 2011 and was conspicuous as @entity2 's most potent attacking force in the 20 - 15 defeat at @entity34 from his accustomed position at 13			1
with victory at @entity40 on saturday essential to set up a series decider in @entity42 , the timing of the change is risky , but @entity43 is convinced it will work			0
@entity45 recovery : @entity46 returns as scrum - half after minor shoulder surgery saw him miss the first test ' we had to make sure in training that @entity0 understood the way our wingers defend and was comfortable with that because obviously it 's a change for him , ' @entity7 said			1
straight back : @entity56 was one of 15 players from @entity20 finalists @entity59 and @entity18 to be made available comes in at fly - half ' he was happy and certainly when we talked through our strike plays we 've got some real options now			1
' we 've got that balance in our backline we 've always looked for , which is pace , power , ball - carrying and footballing ability			2
' having seen @entity0 play on the wing at age grade and understanding how effective he was , i always thought of it as an option			0
' what we 've now got is some real quality in the centres who can get the ball to him			0
' the ball will be kicked to him a fair amount so he 'll have plenty of counter-attack opportunities			0
' but we have to be careful not to suggest we 're basing our whole gameplan around one player because we 're certainly not			0
' the physicality of our centres has not been diminished by picking @entity89			0
@entity15 can do things and distribute in ways @entity0 ca n't			2
' @entity7 is confident that @entity92 - who offers the playmaking option at inside centre he favours - is ready to play despite his recent inactivity			0
centre stage : @entity14 is back after an ankle injury to partner no 13 @entity15 ' all you can do is trust your instincts and in what you see in training , ' said @entity7 , who has made seven changes , two positional , following last weekend 's defeat in @entity106			1
' everything i have seen in training has led me to believe that @entity89 is ready to start			0
' @entity2 are confident @entity0 , who ousts @entity110 from the 23 completely , has the pace , speed on the turn and defence to make the transition a success			0
the only question mark hangs over his aerial ability , but a plan has been devised to compensate for his shortcomings in this area			0
big presence : @entity122 replaces @entity123 at blindside flanker in the only change to the starting pack ' if @entity0 does n't quite get up in the air and someone else catches it , he 'll tackle them			2
quite hard , ' @entity7 said			0
sitting lower on the selectorial @entity131 than @entity0 but surprising nonetheless was @entity133 's retention in the second row alongside @entity135			2
@entity136 , another of @entity18 's @entity20 heroes , was expected to replace @entity133 but the @entity138 and @entity143 's leadership , line - out expertise and superb performance in the first test have proved decisive			1
@entity144 has won the 50 - 50 call over @entity146 while @entity147 continues at number eight with @entity149 sitting on a heavyweight bench that is central to @entity2 's gameplan for @entity152			1
it is hoped the arrival of @entity146 , @entity136 , @entity149 and wing @entity155 in the final half - hour will tip the scales against the @entity3			1
rewarded : @entity144 keeps his place despite the arrival of @entity146 , who will come off the bench ' we feel the game is going to take the full 80 minutes to win and part of the selection has been the make - up of the bench , ' @entity7 said			1
' the likes of @entity146 , @entity136 and @entity149 will bring a huge amount of energy from the bench and hopefully see us home			1
' @entity89 's quite a good person to have on your bench when he 's angry and annoyed because he 's missed out on starting			2
' @entity155 ' role will be coming on and getting on the end of linebreaks - we made quite a lot of linebreaks last week but did n't quite finish them off			0
' as expected @entity122 returns at blindside flanker with the unlucky @entity123 dropping out of the 23 altogether			2
@entity56 and @entity46 , who has recovered from a shoulder problem , start at half - back with @entity182 offering fly - half and full - back cover from the bench			1
@entity186 ( @entity187 ) ; @entity188 ( @entity31 ) , @entity189 ( @entity190 ) , @entity191 ( @entity192 ) , @entity193 ( @entity187 ) ; @entity194 ( @entity59 ) , @entity195 ( @entity187 ) ; @entity196 ( @entity187 ) , @entity197 ( @entity198 ) , @entity199 ( @entity198 ) , @entity200 ( @entity201 ) , @entity202 ( @entity31 ) , @entity203 ( @entity190 ) , @entity204 ( @entity187 , capt ) , @entity205 ( @entity192 )			0
replacements : @entity207 ( @entity190 ) , @entity208 ( @entity201 ) , @entity209 ( @entity210 ) , @entity211 ( @entity190 ) , @entity212 ( @entity59 ) , @entity213 ( @entity31 ) , @entity214 ( @entity31 ) , @entity215 ( @entity59 ) .			0
