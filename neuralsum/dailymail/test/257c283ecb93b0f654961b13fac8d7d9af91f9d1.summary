@entity0 is earning less than @entity1			1
in fact he 's earning less than half of what @entity1 is on at @entity5			1
puts a few things into perspective does n't it ? @entity5 have made some poor decisions in terms of signings and contracts since @entity13 departed , and those mistakes look set to cost them their place in the top four			2
for @entity18 ' sake whoever is in charge of sorting out @entity0 's new contract this summer needs to get it right			1
if they think they can afford to lose @entity13 , @entity24 and @entity0 in the space of 12 months they are very much mistaken			0
@entity0 's contract negotiations have dominated the headlines in the past fortnight @entity0 shares a laugh in training ahead of @entity5 's @entity31 replay with @entity32 on wednesday @entity1 earns more than double @entity0 at present despite failing to perform in a @entity5 shirt @entity0 's agent has been accused of giving him bad advice			1
apparently what people want his agent to tell him is that he 's not particularly good , he 's too young to earn big money , and he should sign whatever contract @entity5 offer him because he should be grateful just to even be there			1
the advice the agent gave was to turn down the contract offer and focus on football until the summer			2
the big problem here is not the tired old narrative of a young greedy footballer			0
it 's that @entity5 , through @entity18 , have repeatedly told the press and the fans that there would be no problem and @entity0 would sign the new deal			1
in the middle of december , @entity18 described @entity0 as ' a talisman ' and told us he was confident he would stay			2
at the end of january , @entity18 told us the contract would be ' concluded imminently '			0
last month he described the new offer to @entity0 as ' incredible '			0
@entity5 boss @entity18 has always insisted that the @entity0 talks would be concluded soon @entity0 has been linked with a move to @entity65 , admitting he was ' flattered ' by their interest @entity18 has repeatedly insisted that @entity0 will not be moving anywhere this summer @entity5 find themselves seven points adrift in the race for the @entity71 places @entity18 has said things there he had no right to say , but those assurances he gave have now served to make @entity0 and his agent out to be the bad guys			1
the astonished response of hypocritical ex-pros and pundits stuck in an era where the maximum wage still exists was blown up beyond proportion			0
' how dare this greedy young man who 's won nothing , scored less goals than @entity87 ( who thought that one up ? ) turn down this incredible offer from this great club			2
he should be grateful to be at such a club			0
' this was the standard response from people out of touch with the modern game			0
the ' incredible ' deal was actually an offer which put @entity0 on a par with @entity1			1
@entity5 should be embarrassed by that offer to @entity0 , a player who kept quiet last summer when he watched @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity1 all walk through the door and sign deals worth more than double what he was on			1
he then stayed quiet while his performances were being scrutinised more than most in the absence of @entity13 and @entity109 , with @entity101 injured at the start of the campaign and with @entity24 fading fast			0
@entity101 has been hindered by injuries since he arrived at @entity113 from @entity114 last summer @entity102 also arrived at @entity5 from @entity114 in the summer and earns more than @entity0 the departure of @entity24 to the @entity116 this summer will free up space on @entity5 's wage bill meantime @entity18 said there would be no issue with @entity0 signing again , so when it turned out there was a problem , @entity0 was instantly the bad guy , along with his agent			1
now the message from those who want to bring @entity0 down is that he 's not very good			2
' he 's not good enough to move to a bigger club ' ( since when were @entity5 a small club by the way ? ) ' he would be stuck on the bench if he moved			2
' ' @entity130 is better			0
' ' let him go , @entity131 is coming through			0
' if people want to believe all that it 's up to them , but it wo n't alter these facts : @entity24 and @entity137 are set to leave this summer which will free up a huge amount of the wages budget at @entity113			1
@entity130 would provide an alternative should @entity0 depart @entity113 in the summer the emergence of teenage winger @entity131 also suggests there could be life beyond @entity0 at @entity5 @entity0 should be playing @entity71 football - something @entity5 may not offer next season @entity24 knows all about contract situations not being addressed , and that 's why he said two months ago that the club need to sort out the futures of @entity0 and @entity151 ' before it 's too late '			1
it was an important message from the captain that got lost in all the negative spin aimed at bringing @entity0 and his agent 's credibility down			0
the last two defeats have brought the debate back to where it should be : the mistakes made by @entity18 and @entity5			0
ramping up the hate towards a young @entity165 player who wants to play in the @entity71 and wants to earn significantly more than a total waste of space like @entity1 will hopefully now be seen for what it is – a way of deflecting from the real issues at @entity113			1
what 's really disappointing is that a young talented player has had to put up with all this criticism			0
it 's classically @entity165 i 'm afraid			2
those critics should be ashamed of themselves			0
seriously - imagine if @entity178 do want @entity0 this summer , as @entity5 prepare for a @entity180 campaign			1
would it be good advice to turn down that move ?			0

@entity0 is currently earning less than half @entity1 's salary
even signing new **£** *100,000* - a - week deal would only take him to parity
@entity5 boss @entity18 has insisted @entity0 will put *pen* to paper
but he has assumed he *'ll* stay at @entity5 when he has other *ambitions*
@entity0 should be playing in the @entity71
and @entity5 , seven points off fourth place , may not be able to offer that
@entity200 : @entity65 only turn it on when the pressure is off
@entity200 : @entity204 and @entity205 are @entity207 's only players with the ' football *intelligence* ' demanded by @entity209
click here for all the latest @entity5 news
@entity0 is a very good player
he 's been performing at a high level *consistently* for two seasons
if a club is prepared to pay **£** *50m* he would play *regularly* for them
there would be no *shortage* of clubs wanting to sign him – @entity178 have already said they are *monitoring* his situation
@entity18 says they wo n't sell this summer , but it 's more bluster i 'm afraid . common sense *dictates* they ca n't afford to let his contract run down to its final year . the situation needs to be addressed
@entity0 wants to play @entity71 football . what 's so *wrong* with that ?
