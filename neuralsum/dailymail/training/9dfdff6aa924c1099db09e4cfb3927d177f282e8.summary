by @entity0 celebrity chefs such as @entity2 have been blamed for a surge in deadly chip pan fines			1
the @entity5 today revealed fires from deep - frying pans increased 14 per cent between 2012 and 2013 , and suggested a new trend for authentic ' posh ' chips could be behind it			1
techniques such as the triple - cooking favoured by mr @entity2 are especially dangerous , the brigade suggested , and could have contributed to the hundreds of injuries caused by chip pan fires in recent years			1
trend - setter : @entity5 warned that a vogue for ' posh ' chips could be putting people in danger technique : mr @entity2 recommends deep - frying chips twice - which fire experts say heightens the risk concentration : a fire brigade spokesman said even a moment 's lapse when using deep - fryers can end in disaster the chef 's technique involves boiling the raw potatoes , and cooling them in the freezer before two rounds of deep - frying , to achieve the crispiest texture possible			1
firefighter @entity38 said : ' many people think that chip pans are a thing of the past , but there 's been a recent rise in celebrity chefs endorsing posh chips on tv cooking programmes			1
' @entity47 and cooking with hot oil can be really dangerous and the risk increases when you start frying food more than once , as is the current trend with chips			1
' all it can take is for you to become distracted for a few seconds and your cooking oil can quickly go up in flames			2
' deadly : @entity59 pan fires , pictured here in fire brigade controlled demonstrations , have killed three people and injured 500 in @entity64 in the past five years over the past five years , there were 1,754 chip pan fires in @entity64 resulting in 500 people being injured and three people being killed			1
however , the fire brigade stressed that overall fires were down by a quarter			2
they suggested that people visit their local chip shop , or use the oven , rather than attempting to imitate chefs such as mr @entity2			1
firefighters also warned that , if a chip pan does catch fire , it is best not move it , and not try to extinguish it with water - as it will create a huge fireball			1
instead , people should call the fire brigade			2
representatives for mr @entity2 were not available for comment			1
perfection : the triple - cooking recipe is said to produce the ultimate chips to serve four people ingredients : 1.2 kg potatoes1 litre groundnut oil1 litre rendered fat ( dripping , goose or duck ) method wash the potatoes and with a sharp kitchen knife square them into rectangles , then cut them into chips about 1 cm thick			1
as soon as they are cut , put them into a bowl under cold running water for 10 minutes or so to rinse off some of the starch , then drain them			2
next , bring a casserole of unsalted water to the boil and plunge in the drained potatoes			0
bring back to the boil and simmer gently until the point of a knife will penetrate the chips easily			0
it is important to make sure the water is only just simmering			0
if it boils too aggressively the potatoes will begin to break up			0
very carefully lift the potatoes out of the water , using a slotted spoon , and place them on a tray			0
allow them to steam cool , then place in the fridge			0
the chips will harden when cold			0
for next stage , heat groundnut oil to a temperature of @entity131 and plunge in the chips			0
they will take on a drier appearance ( do not let them brown at all )			0
drain them , let them cool to room temperature , and put them in the fridge			0
when cold , they are ready for their final cooking			2
heat the rendered fat to @entity147			0
plunge in chips and cook until golden brown			0
this may take 8 - 10 minutes ; be patient in order to obtain a really crisp chip			1
drain and season with salt only ; they will take quite a lot			0
