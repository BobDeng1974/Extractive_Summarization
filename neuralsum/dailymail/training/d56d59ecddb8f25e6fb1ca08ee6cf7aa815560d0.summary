by @entity0 @entity1 will take an eight - shot lead into the final round of the @entity4 at @entity5			1
the 56 - year - old @entity6 began the third round with a seven - stroke advantage over @entity9 and @entity11 's @entity10 and he tightened his grip with a three - under - par round of 68			1
@entity9 had been hoping to exert some pressure on his former @entity16 team - mate but after a three - under - par front nine of 32 , he ran into trouble after the turn , carding a double bogey on the 10th followed by a bogey in the 11th , before dropping another shot on the 17th when his tee shot ran into unraked spikemarks in a bunker			0
leader : @entity1 has an eight - shot lead going into the final round at @entity5 swing : he is taking part in the senior open championship atmospheric : @entity1 walks up the 18th hole during the third round that meant a back nine of 40 and a round of 72 for the @entity38 captain , who is now 11 shots adrift of @entity1 , while @entity10 also lost ground on the runaway leader with a level par 71 to stay on four under par. instead , it was @entity46 's @entity45 , winner of the @entity47 earlier this month , who moved into second place on six under par with a round of 66			2
@entity1 's eight - shot cushion is a new 54 - hole record and it is difficult to imagine him not converting that into a second title to go alongside his victory at @entity57 in 2010			2
' i am one step closer , ' he said ' i still have 18 holes to go			0
it 's nice to have an eight - shot lead but i have still got to keep my head down tomorrow and hit a lot of good golf shots and make some putts and play smart			0

@entity1 leads by eight shots going into the final round of @entity4
