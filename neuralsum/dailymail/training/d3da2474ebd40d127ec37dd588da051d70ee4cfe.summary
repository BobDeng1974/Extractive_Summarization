@entity0 has provoked fury by drastically slashing the number of air miles points it will award passengers buying its cheapest economy class tickets			1
ordinary passengers who travel economy class will have the number of points they can earn slashed by 75 per cent while the points awarded to those in @entity13 and @entity14 will be increased by up to 300 per cent			1
customers who have spent years collecting reward points for @entity0 's scheme – launched as @entity18 but now called @entity19 – described the changes which take effect from april 28 as ' disgusting ' and a ' devaluation			1
' @entity0 passengers are outraged following the announcement of a slashing of @entity19 points for economy passengers , beginning april 28 many customers took to @entity28 to voice their concern , including @entity30 who contemplated switching airline allegiance they took to social media to complain that it now rewards rich and expense - account travellers at the cost of families on tight budgets who use the scheme to make their holidays more affordable			1
@entity0 is introducing different point pricing for reward flights ' depending on the time of the year , the cabin and zone			0
' it says that for two - thirds of the year customers will require fewer points to travel			1
but for the busiest third of the year they will need more			0
the airline - motto ' to fly , to serve ' – defended the radical ' structural changes ' by insisting the new system was fairer because ' those who pay more get more points			2
' those who book into the economy cabin will now receive 75 % fewer ' air miles ' or @entity19 points it also allowed 500,000 more seats to be made available under the loyalty system – taking the total to nine million a year			1
@entity19 is one of the world 's biggest airmiles programmes used by 6.4 million travellers			0
the changes sparked an immediate backlash and accusations that the airline has ' gutted ' the scheme			0
the controversial and at times complex changes creating winners and losers were outlined in a letter to @entity0 's 7,000 executive club members			0
it sets out how points will be awarded more in line with the amount of money a passenger pays for their ticket , rather than just the ' class ' of ticket they buy			1
formerly called @entity18 , the @entity19 rewards points scheme will now be awarded based on the amount of money a passenger pays for their ticket so an economy class passenger who buys a bargain - basement special offer ticket will earn far fewer points than the person sitting next to them who may have paid a lot more for a fully flexible economy ticket			1
under the current scheme , an economy return flight from @entity103 to @entity104 earns 9,400 points – enough for a round - trip from @entity108 to @entity109 , subject to a £ 35 payment			1
but some economy passengers face a 75 per cent drop in the number of @entity19 points earned , which will see them collect just 2,350 points			1
by contrast , business - class and first - class passengers on the same plane will see a rise of 9,400 - points - enough to provide a free flight to @entity122			1
another outraged customer claimed that the announcement is a ' worse deal for poor passengers ' as this @entity28 users points out , the new scheme will make it harder to collect points in economy also under the new scheme , a basic economy - class ticket from @entity108 to @entity133 will from april 28 earn just 865 air - miles – rather than the 3,458 available now			1
even ' silver tier ' executive club members – who include many middle - ranking managers and executives flying on business – will see their tier bonus slashed in half from 100 per cent to 50 per cent			2
this could affect their ability to continue qualifying for silver status , and for the perks they currently receive , such as use of the executive lounge at airports and priority boarding			0
@entity151 travellers who live outside @entity108 and use connecting flights from regional airports to fly to other destinations in @entity155 will be among the worst hit			0
passengers in @entity158 and northern @entity160 travelling to mainland @entity155 will no longer be entitled to a free domestic connecting flight			2
this will ' bring the @entity151 in line with the rest of the world '			0
' silver tier ' club members will see their bonus slashed in half , which could affect their perks , such as the use of lounges in airports @entity173 believes that @entity0 ' have ruined the executive club ' with this move those flying from @entity177 to @entity103 and connecting to @entity178 currently pay 9,000 @entity19 plus £ 35 per person for a return journey			2
from april , the number of points needed , and the cash supplement required , will double			2
by contrast , business and first - class passengers are the big winners			1
first class passengers will see their @entity19 points rise by as much as two - thirds			1
transatlantic passengers from @entity103 to @entity133 's @entity192 will earn 8,645 points on their one - way flight - up from 5,187			1
the changes will also hit passengers when they come to cash - in their points as @entity0 introduces ' peak ' and ' off peak ' pricing for reward flights covering periods such as the school summer holidays , @entity204 and @entity205			2
so a single flight to @entity207 will cost 7,500 points in peak - season july compared to 6,500 points in less popular january			2
however , for those flying first class , passengers ' @entity19 points may rise by as much as two - thirds however , business travellers will see a rise in the number of @entity19 points they need for a flight			1
for example , a business class flight from @entity108 to @entity220 currently costs 100,000 points , but this will rise to 125,000 at off - peak times and 150,000 at peak times			1
travellers also have to pay taxes , fees and charges			0
@entity231 boss @entity230 said in his letter to points collectors : ' our lowest priced tickets in @entity236 and @entity237 will award a minimum @entity19 of 25 % per mile flown instead of 100 %			2
' in club @entity239 and our first cabins the @entity19 you earn will either remain the same as it is now or increase up to 300 % per mile flown depending on the cabin and type of ticket , ' he added			1
but many passengers were unconvinced			0
customer @entity247 tweeted : ' looks like @entity0 just utterly gutted the @entity19 scheme for most flyers			0
shame , it made a big difference to the overall cost			0
' @entity253 ) tweeted : ' shame to see the @entity19 devalution			0
' she said @entity256 to @entity108 had risen from 80,000 to 120,000 points ' plus exorbitant taxes / fees of $ 1,000			0
' @entity260 tweeted : ' @entity0 is disgusting the way you reward the richer with more			0
' @entity0 defended its shake up and insisted that ' for two thirds of the year you will require fewer @entity19 than now to fly on reward seats			0
' a @entity0 spokesman said : ' an off - peak economy return to @entity133 will cost 26,000 @entity19 , down from 40,000 at present '			0
' we 're now guaranteeing there will be nine million redemption seats a year available – more than 500,000 more than before			0
for the first time , we guarantee that there will be a minimum of four seats in economy and two in business available for booking with @entity19 on every @entity0 flight			2

economy class passengers will have points they can earn slashed by 75 %
points awarded to those in @entity13 and business class will increase by 300 %
