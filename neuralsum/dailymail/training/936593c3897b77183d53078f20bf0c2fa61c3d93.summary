but while waiting for the operation , @entity18 , of @entity19 , says an intruder ' took sentimental items we can never get back '			0
@entity9 ( pictured speaking at a press conference last year ) is awaiting a double arm transplant ' that really hurt us deep			1
they took the necklace my grandfather wore through a @entity32 prison and my great grandmother 's ring we were going to give to our daughter , ' her husband @entity26 told @entity36			0
@entity18 's specially modified van was also attempted to be stolen on another occasion while her neighbors where out of town at the start of july			1
the family then received another blow when they were asked to leave a hotel in @entity47 on july 3rd because @entity18 's disability made the owners feel uncomfortable			2
her husband said : ' i called the front desk to say the tv was n't working and they guys said we 're really not comfortable with your wife 's disability and we 'd like for you guys to check out			0
' it was humiliating and frustrating ' , he said			0
the family have continued to stay positive throughout adversity though and @entity18 says the first thing she wants to do with her new arms is ' smack my husband			2
' @entity26 told the @entity68 , @entity69 , new site : ' we 're blessed			0
we 've won the lottery and we 're still married even if she 's going to hit me when she gets her arms			0
' @entity18 will receive two new arms above the elbow but the former massage therapist still has n't had a date approved for the transplant			1
@entity9 and her husband @entity26 after he made the decision to have her limbs amputated after his wife fell into a coma as she suffered the affects of a flesh eating bacteria approved by the pioneering hospital for the transplant after undergoing a rigorous evaluation , @entity18 has battled through two years of rehabilitation as a result of losing all her limbs after giving birth to her third child in 2010			1
' i want my life back , ' said @entity9 to reporters at a press conference last september			1
' i want to hold my children , i want to hug my husband , i want to cook dinner			0
' @entity9 lost her arms and legs to a @entity103 that accelerated into flesh eating bacteria four days after giving birth to her third child			1
the former runner and yoga enthusiast had her arms amputated above the elbow , her legs above the knees and also lost her uterus and her large intestines as doctors battled to keep her alive			0
' i never thought about how much a gift your hands are , ' said @entity9 at the press conference			1
' when you do n't have hands , you ca n't wear rings			0
' after raising $ 200,000 to cover living expenses , @entity9 and her family moved from @entity69 in july 2012 to prepare for the surgery			1
before : @entity18 and @entity26 with their children @entity125 and @entity128 ( left ) and the happy couple on their 10th wedding anniversary ( right ) ' she knew from day one she wanted arm transplants , not just prosthetics , ' her brother - in - law @entity132 said to the @entity135			2
' i ’m just shocked and amazed that science has come this far			0
' @entity18 is just a wonderful and fabulous person , and the tragedy of her getting the strep and how it ravaged her body was just a nightmare , but she ’s so strong , she just pulled through			0
' i ’ll never forget when she woke up from the coma , ' he recalled			0
' she was like , ‘ ok , let ’s get to work , ’ and we were all saying , ‘ no , you need some down time			0
’ @entity9 also underwent psychological and physical screening at the hospital to determine her eligibility for the grueling surgery and long recovery			1
the transplant could give @entity9 the ability to flex and extend her elbows and to lift herself out of a wheelchair			1
the level of function she will acquire , especially in her new hands , is uncertain , said @entity162 , director of plastic surgery transplantation at the @entity13			1
all the previous above - the - elbow arm transplants similar to the procedure being planned for @entity9 have been performed in @entity166 , @entity167 , by dr. @entity168			1
@entity9 had psychological and physical screenings to see if the @entity6 hospital would allow her to have the complicated surgery for @entity9 the loss of her independence has been difficult but her husband @entity26 has called her his hero @entity9 and her husband @entity26 on their wedding day on july 31st , 1999			1
@entity9 has said that what she is most looking forward to is wearing her wedding ring again when the operation is carried out a team of 40 doctors will be involved said dr. @entity184			1
the double transplant will connect skin , muscle , bone and blood vessels in both arms			2
however , while doctors and experts do not doubt the ability of the surgical team at @entity13 and women 's to attach arms onto @entity9 , some are unsure whether full function will be restored			1
this is due to the fact that unlike internal organ transplants , hand and arm transplants are dependent on nerve regrowth to function normally said dr. @entity205 , the administrative medical director of the @entity206 at @entity207			2
nerves regrow at the speed of around one millimeter a day said @entity205 , who has been involved in previous @entity13 and women 's surgical procedures			2
' the recipient nerves have to regrow in the donor shell , ' said @entity205 to @entity214			2
' at this point , there 's no technology to expedite that growth			0
' theoretically , there 's a risk that these patients may not be functional or as functional as a distal hand transplant			2
' @entity9 and her daughter , @entity223 , at home in @entity69 following @entity18 's amputations struggle : despite fitted with limbs that help her walk on her own , her struggle has been beyond difficult and she at first wondered if it was worth it , before remembering her family @entity9 relies on her family to help her around the house @entity9 has paid tribute to the medical team at @entity13 and women 's as she prepares to enter the next phase of quest to regain arms			1

they ’re giving so much hope to people , especially veterans , who are coming home with missing limbs , ' she said			0
@entity9 touched the heart of the nation in 2010 when it was revealed she had contracted a flesh eating bacteria while giving birth to daughter @entity223			2
surgeons in @entity68 , @entity69 , had no choice but to amputate her arms and legs to save her life			0
after returning home @entity9 , a massage therapist , struggled to come to terms with the loss of her limbs			1
she was fitted with prosthetic arms allowing her to hold her baby daughter for the first time			0
@entity9 learned to cope with her new life with the help of her two other children , 18 year old daughter amber and eight year old son , @entity128			2
