a man hunting whitetail deer in @entity2 last week thought he 'd bagged an 8 - point trophy buck he could show off back home in @entity5			1
@entity6 was right about one thing : the deer sported an impressive rack , but it was n't a buck			1
@entity6 realized his understandable mistake while skinning the animal			2
' it did n’t have the right private parts , ' he told the @entity17			1
@entity6 , who calls @entity18 , @entity5 home , had stumbled upon a very rare antlered doe -- a 1 in 10,000 phenomenon the occurs when a female deer has an overabundance of testosterone			1
' it did n’t have the right private parts ' : @entity6 killed what he thought was an 8 - point trophy buck on wednesday			1
when he skinned it , he realized it was actually a 1 in 10,000 antlered doe ' i ’m tickled to death			0
i know this is a once in a lifetime thing , ' he told the @entity17			0
@entity6 's kill was made especially rare by the high quality of the deer 's antlers			2
more often than not , an antlered deer has an off - looking rack with lots of points growing in all directions			2
and more common than that , most antlered deer never lose the velvet that covers male antlers through the spring because they lack enough testosterone to drive them to rub off the covering			2
' you could see tree bark on the antlers where she ’d been rubbing them against trees , like a buck , ' he said			0
@entity6 told the @entity17 that , at least at first blush , the deer looked like any normal buck as he lined up to shoot it at the edge of a hay field			1
it was with a group of other bucks that were chasing a group of does as potential mates			0
he did n't notice at the time that his deer lacked the necks swollen for mating season that the other bucks sported			0
the other does knew , though			0
' [ it tried ] to follow the does around , but they wanted nothing to do with her , ' he said			0
' i guess they saw the antlers and just assumed			0
' @entity79 or not , though , @entity6 plans to mount the impressive rack like any other .			1

@entity6 of @entity18 , @entity5 was hunting with a friend in @entity2 when he *spotted* what he thought was a trophy buck
while skinning his prize , @entity6 said it *dawned* on him the deer ' did n’t have the right private parts '
@entity6 plans to mount the head of the deer , which suffered from an overabundance of testosterone , *nonetheless*
