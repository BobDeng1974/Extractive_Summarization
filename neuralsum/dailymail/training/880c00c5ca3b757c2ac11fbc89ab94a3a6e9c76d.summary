under the new grant the @entity2 receives 15 % of the profits from the @entity33 , but from funds two years in arrears			0
the @entity33 's 2011/12 accounts revealed profits of £ 240.2million and the final figure for the grant was rounded up to £ 36.1million - very close to the estimated amount - by the @entity40 in december			1
the @entity9 has been set at £ 36.1million - up from £ 31million in 2012 , which included £ 1million for the @entity17 the money is used partly for maintenance on the royal palaces including @entity44 , pictured @entity46 accounts released last year showed the cost to the taxpayer of supporting the monarchy rose marginally during 2011/12			1
