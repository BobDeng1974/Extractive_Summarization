set in the grey stones of the @entity4 chapel , the red of the two doors makes a bold , slightly unexpected statement			1
but that distinctive splash of colour is the only clue to the identity of the man who turned this building into a family home			2
in the early 1970s , sir @entity13 brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his virgin recording business			1
and from then until the present day , the @entity18 logo – which has gone on to adorn trains , planes and a multitude of other businesses – has always been printed in the red of those humble chapel doors			1
sir @entity13 converted the @entity25 in @entity26 - on - @entity27 , @entity28 , into a home in the 1970s at the time he converted the property , @entity13 had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel at @entity34 in @entity26 - on - @entity27 , @entity28			1
at @entity35 , the first @entity18 albums , such as @entity38 's @entity37 , were recorded and @entity13 would use the @entity25 as a weekend retreat			1
other artists using @entity35 included @entity41 , the @entity42 and @entity43			0
' i saw @entity13 coming and going into the @entity25 in the 1970s , ' says @entity34 resident @entity45 , 57			1
' i often used to see him in the village pub , @entity47 , having a meal with family and friends and he was always very pleasant			2
' he brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his @entity18 recording business the entrepreneur painted the doors of the country retreat his trademark bright red , pictured with @entity59 he adds that the @entity25 was n't always a complete retreat from @entity13 's rock ' n ' roll world			1
' he often had parties there and we heard the music , even though we were four doors away – but it was n't a problem			2
i think he only used the house at the weekends , and he was well liked in the village			0
' other residents recall that @entity13 was a regular visitor to the village shop on sundays , buying breakfast for his overnight visitors			1
@entity13 's love affair with this part of @entity28 continued after he left the @entity25			1
he owned @entity35 until the 1990s and , for two decades , also owned @entity79 in the village of @entity81 , which he sold to his children a few years ago when he moved his base to @entity84 in the @entity85			0
' @entity13 did a superb job on the chapel , ' says @entity88 , the home 's current owner , who bought it in 2007			1
' we have n't had to do much , apart from putting in solid oak flooring and new central heating with @entity4 - style radiators			0
' the four - bedroom home is now on the market for £ 599,000			1
at the time he converted the property , @entity13 had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel the four - bedroom home is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout the building the village of @entity34 is in the parliamentary constituency of @entity106 , prime minister @entity108 's seat – and the poet @entity109 lived in @entity110 in the 1940s			1
but the village has another claim to fame , one that relates to the @entity25 itself			2
in 1725 , @entity117 , one of the founders of the @entity119 , gave his first sermon in the @entity121 in the village			0
it 's fitting , then , that a century and a half later , 85 years after @entity117 's death , the village came to have a @entity127 chapel of its own – the very property that @entity13 would one day end up converting			1

' we were looking for a property in @entity34 as we had friends in the area , ' says recently separated @entity88 , 50 – a management consultant with two children , @entity149 , 15 , and @entity150 , 13			2
' we fell in love with the house the moment we saw it			0
' @entity88 only found out @entity13 had been a previous owner on his second viewing			2
' that undoubtedly increased our interest , especially when we realised what an excellent job he had done converting it into a home , without losing too many of its original features , ' said @entity88			0
