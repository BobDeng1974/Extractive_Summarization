she 's the @entity1 woman who reached inside herself and delivered her own twins during a caesarean section			1
three days before @entity4 , @entity5 , 41 , gave birth to her 10th and 11th children , @entity8 and @entity9 , in a very unusual procedure at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
it was to be mrs @entity5 's fifth experience having a caesarean - but she did n't want a traditional one			1
' it 's my body , it 's my birth , it 's my baby , ' she said she was ' devastated ' when she learned she had a complication in her 36th week and would have to have a caesarean			1
' my other caesareans were very sterile , very surgical , very impersonal , ' she told @entity28 from her home on the @entity30			2
' people were talking about what they did on the weekend without even thinking about me laying on the table , going through this momentous experience of having a baby			2
' but then she recalled a procedure she had read about online - a maternal assisted caesarean			1
it is a typical caesarean , performed by doctors , with the only difference being the mother reaches into her belly and lifts the infant out at the end			1
her @entity46 ( obstetrician - gynaecologist ) was not convinced			2
' no , no , no ' , he said			0
her husband , @entity49 , joked that she was causing trouble			0
but mrs @entity5 is used to getting what she wants			1
' it 's my body , it 's my birth , it 's my baby , ' she said			1
first mrs @entity5 brought @entity8 up to her chest , and a minute later @entity9 joined her mrs @entity5 said it was a wonderfully personal moment - just as if she had a natural birth			1
' this was much more personal , ' she said @entity9 and @entity8 are happy and healthy and will be the @entity5 's last children and that was the way it was			1
the @entity46 changed tack after doing some research and considering her special circumstances			2
' ( the doctor ) was quite willing once he realised the risk of infection was n't as high as he perhaps first thought , ' mrs @entity66 said			2
' i came to him and said : " this is what i need to reclaim my birth - to make it more personal for me , so i can be a good mother			2
' ' it was more about making it that much more personal , and for me to have a connection to the birth of my children so on december 22 , mrs @entity5 walked into an operating theatre and ' scrubbed in ' over a sink with her obstetrician			1
she had two pairs of elbow - length gloves placed on her arms and sat on the bed , where she had an epidural			0
@entity8 was born at 3.04kg , while @entity9 was 2.54kg			0
@entity5 stayed in hospital a week afterwards to recover she laid down			1
the first set of gloves were taken off - leaving a second pair on - and she was under strict instructions not to move her arms from her chest			0
' i was n't allowed to touch anything			0
i was n't allowed to move			0
was n't allowed to do anything until they had told me to			0
' that way , i was completely sterile - i was n't supposed to touch anything			0
' then ( after a while ) he leaned over to me and went , " are you ready to meet these babies ? " ' i went " oh my god ! ... okay , really ! " ' ' it was just like a normal @entity107 from then until he said , " reach down and grab your babies "			0
' i just brought her ( @entity8 ) up to my chest and i held her in my left arm			0
' and then a minute later he said , " come and get the other one "			0
mrs @entity5 , above , is pictured being ' scrubbed up ' ( left )			1
she had two pairs of gloves put on to ensure they were sterile , with the second layer peeled off ( right ) once she laid down touching moment : the parents meet their newborn babies , @entity9 and @entity8 @entity8 and @entity9 are the tenth and eleventh children of ms @entity123 the twins are now the youngest of a ' noisy and chaotic ' batch of siblings - the eldest , @entity127 , is 19 - who are far from spoilt and ' very involved in the community ' , she said ' ( @entity9 ) was breached , so it was a little bit awkward picking her up			2
' but i reached out with my right hand and someone helped me turn her around the right way and put her on my chest as well			2
' and then i had both of them ! ' mrs @entity5 said it was a wonderfully personal moment - just as if she had a natural birth			1
' this was much more personal , ' she said			0
@entity8 was born at 3.04kg , while @entity9 was 2.54kg			0
@entity5 stayed in hospital a week afterwards to recover			2
they are now the youngest of a ' noisy and chaotic ' batch of siblings - the eldest , @entity127 , is 19 - who are far from spoilt and ' very involved in the community ' , she said			0
as for the two latest additions to the @entity150 family , they are both happy and healthy			0
they will be the @entity5 couple 's last children			1
' ( they 're ) precious timewasters , ' mrs @entity5 said			1
' i could stare at them all day long			0
