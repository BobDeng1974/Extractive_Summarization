' campaigner @entity53 , from @entity54 , told @entity55 : ' supermarkets can be very clever			0
@entity0 owns nearly 30 per cent of the market and they know that a penny rise here and a penny rise there makes a huge difference to their bottom line , but consumers might not notice it			0
' the @entity12 range has been a great thing for them - and i will say , for the consumer as well - but more people are in food poverty now than ever			0
' times are tough and now is not the time to penalise people who ca n't afford it			0
' my message to consumers would be : shop around and do n't be misled by loyalty - you wo n't be rewarded for it			0
' hike : the rises have seen the price of a tin of mushy peas go up from 8p to 25p no - frills : @entity0 's own - brand tomato ketchup has also gone up in price , from 16p to 30p the retailer has said it was forced to introduce the hikes as a result of rising commodity costs and food inflation , but insisted its @entity12 range was still priced extremely competitively when compared to similar ranges at rival supermarkets			1
but the fact that the retailer put up most of the prices over november and december has led to suggestions @entity0 did so to cash in on last - minute shoppers in the run up to @entity8 , as well as those turning to own brand items in a bid to save money at the start of the new year			1
@entity108 , from @entity109 , said : ' those who are most hard - up are likely to choose this range of goods , so any price rise to the value range is very disappointing			0

a @entity0 spokeswoman said : ' at @entity0 we 're committed to offering our customers great quality products at great prices through our everyday value range , and in these difficult times for our customers we are working hard to keep the cost of food shopping down			2
' while factors such as rising commodity costs and food inflation mean that some products have increased in price slightly over the past year , most of our @entity12 products have stayed at the same low prices or are now even cheaper , ' the spokeswoman added			2
today @entity0 revealed its best @entity138 sales figures for three years as it posted a 1.8 per cent rise in like - for - like sales for the six weeks up to january 5			2
