the letters , written to long - serving hat - maker @entity10 over 25 years , the missives also touch on @entity6 's passion for corgis and her knowledge of running a business			1
others contain thanks for hats made by mr @entity10 and a touching sentence in which the @entity6 describes herself as ' almost the only person ' who wears hats all the time			1
but it is the letters that are likely to attract the most interest , with auctioneers saying they could fetch as much as £ 2,000 when they are sold later this month			0
