by @entity0 published : 10:38 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 11:11 est , 26 september 2013 @entity1 died when he was two - days - old at @entity2 in @entity3			1
his mother , @entity4 , had expressed concerns about his reluctance to feel and his abnormal crying a woman claims midwives treated her as an ‘ anxious new mum ’ just hours before her newborn son died in hospital			1
@entity1 died at @entity2 in @entity3 on january 17 last year , two days after he was born by emergency caesarean section			1
@entity13 heard his mother , @entity4 , mentioned to hospital staff that her son was reluctant to feed and was crying unusually			1
mrs @entity16 , of @entity17 , @entity3 , said she was ‘ sick with worry ’ over her son ’s condition , but midwives simply dismissed her concerns as ‘ paranoia ’			1
just hours later , mrs @entity16 discovered her son , who weighed six pounds , floppy and lifeless in his cot			2
resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead at 2.45am			0
an inquest into @entity1 ’s death heard a root cause analysis investigation ( @entity30 ) found four failures in his care , including failures to recognise poor feeding and unusual crying			1
the hearing was told it was not possible to ascertain an exact cause of death , but @entity1 could have suffered from hypoglycaemia - low blood sugar - which may have triggered his loss of consciousness			1
@entity43 coroner @entity42 , who reached a narrative conclusion , is writing a report referencing ways to improve care at @entity2 raised during the inquest			1
‘ it is of note that the recorded observations were generally normal and staff did not have concerns about @entity1 ’s progress , ’ she said			2
‘ the parents did have concerns about his feeding and his crying and raised these with staff			2
‘ the staff said his level of feeding was typical for normal babies and not of concern to them			0
‘ in relation to his crying , they did not believe it caused any concern and were reassured when his observations came back as normal			0
’ ms @entity42 said she considered reaching a conclusion of neglect but heard no evidence of ‘ gross failures ’ in @entity1 ’s care by hospital staff			0
she will now write a report to the hospital following comments by dr @entity78 , who made a number of recommendations to the inquest			0
these included a graph showing birth weight and gestation , better synthesis between doctors and midwives and education packs for hypoglycaemia			0
@entity4 and @entity91 say they were treated like ' anxious new parents ' when they expressed their concerns about @entity1 to midwives the inquest was told @entity1 was born weighing 2.7kg - 200g under the ‘ low birth weight ’ of 2.5kg - by caesarean section at @entity2 at 2.57am on january 15 2012			1
he appeared to be doing well for the first 24 hours , but the following morning , mrs @entity16 noticed he was crying in a ‘ jerky way ’ and was reluctant to feed			0
mrs @entity16 told the inquest she reported her concerns to midwife @entity101 but was made to feel like an ‘ anxious new mum ’ and was reassured that her son was fine			2
‘ i was sick with worry and felt i was being treated as a paranoid mother , ’ she said			0
‘ at the time i felt i was being brushed off			0
’ both @entity1 and mrs @entity16 were examined through the day but all observations returned as normal , with a second midwife also reassuring the family			0
but in the early hours of the following morning , mrs @entity16 discovered @entity1 ‘ floppy and lifeless ’ in his cot and rushed him to the midwife station for help			1
‘ i repeated that he was ill all day and none of them had listened to me , ’ she said			0
‘ the alarm sounded and a lot of medical staff came rushing to @entity1 ’s aid			0
’ an inquest into @entity1 's death heard that the cause of his death could not be formally established but that he could have had low blood sugar			1
mr and mrs @entity16 are pictured arriving at the inquest resuscitation efforts did not succeed and @entity1 was pronounced dead at 2.45am			2
@entity129 dr @entity128 said post-mortem tests showed @entity1 had high insulin levels but could not ascertain his glucose levels before resuscitation , meaning it was impossible to say whether he was hypoglycaemic			0
he said the cause of death was ‘ unexpected death of a neonate ’ but that @entity1 ’s raised insulin levels , low birth weight , a pulmonary haemorrhage and abnormalities in his pancreas - which could suggest a problem regulating insulin levels - should also be recorded			1
mrs @entity16 told the inquest : ‘ i feel completely let down by the medical professionals at @entity2 , particularly the midwifery team who failed to listen to my concerns			1
’ midwife @entity149 , who qualified six months earlier , said there were ‘ no warning triggers ’ to refer @entity1 to a different ward or care team			0
experienced colleagues agreed with her observations and said @entity1 appeared healthy , with his feeding chart similar to other newborns			2
but @entity1 had four feeds in a 24 hour period - one breast feed and three 10ml servings of formula - two fewer than recommended , the inquest was told			1
@entity163 also considered his cry to be ‘ unusual ’ but not ‘ abnormal ’ , which would have been noted on medical charts			0
mrs @entity16 told the inquest : ' i feel completely let down by the medical professionals at @entity2 ( pictured ) , particularly the midwifery team who failed to listen to my concerns ' @entity172 , head of midwifery at the @entity174 , said charts now featured ‘ unusual crying ’ as a result of @entity1 ’s death			1
observations had also been increased , there was more supervision , extra training and support had been offered to staff and clearer ways to escalate concerns introduced , she added			0
speaking after the inquest , @entity1 ’s parents @entity4 , 37 , who works in @entity187 , and @entity91 , 43 , an it consultant , said they had suffered with depression after his death			1
mrs @entity16 said : ‘ we were absolutely disgusted at the care @entity1 and i were given and it has been very hard to relive the events during the inquest			2
‘ @entity91 and i knew something was seriously wrong with @entity1 and i was becoming more and more concerned because he would n’t feed , but the midwives made me feel like i was overreacting and that i was wasting their time			1
@entity1 was born by emergency caesarean section at @entity2 at 2.57am on january 15 2012			1
he weighed just 6lbs ( picture is posed by models ) ‘ @entity1 was our first baby and we were so excited to bring him back to our family home but we never got chance to do this			0
his death still affects us every day and i ’m not sure we ’ll ever come to terms with it			0
‘ to be honest , what happened made us lose all faith in maternity services and we were terrified the same thing would happen again if i became pregnant			0
‘ we just hope that @entity1 ’s death was not in vain and that improvements are made in observational charts and training to ensure no other family has to go through the same ordeal			2
‘ nothing can bring @entity1 back but seeing improvements in maternity services might help us to begin the process of accepting what happened			0
’ mr and mrs @entity16 have instructed medical law experts at @entity226 to investigate @entity1 ’s death			2
@entity227 , a partner at @entity226 ’s @entity3 office , who represents the family , said : ‘ we will now continue to work on behalf of @entity4 and @entity91 in liaising with the @entity174 to secure an admission of responsibility which we hope will help them to begin to come to terms with what happened and begin to rebuild their lives			1
