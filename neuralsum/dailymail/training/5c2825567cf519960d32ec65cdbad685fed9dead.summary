what a derby ! three great penalty claims , one red card , perhaps two others missed and a superb winning goal			1
so many questions were asked of referee @entity6 that his head will be buzzing well into the week as he analyses what he got right and what he should work on			1
@entity12 on @entity13 ( 42mins ) - a clear penalty as the @entity15 kicked the @entity16 forward on the @entity17 from behind			1
for @entity18 to then turn and have a go at @entity13 was disgraceful			0
there were some suggestions on @entity22 that @entity12 spat at @entity13 as he lay on the turf			2
however , it looked like saliva falling from his mouth as he shouted at the striker			0
@entity12 appeared to catch @entity13 from behind in the penalty area the @entity32 striker falls to the ground after the makeshift defender clips the back of his ankle @entity12 had some choice words for @entity13 after he remained on the deck following the tackle 2			1
@entity39 on @entity40 ( 45mins ) - right on half - time a fascinating challenge as @entity40 was played clean through , but @entity39 made a last - ditch lunge and appeared to kick the ball away from between @entity40 ’s legs			2
from @entity6 ’s central position , while @entity39 ’s follow - through certainly caught @entity40 , it was almost impossible to determine if he caught the @entity49 before he played the ball			1
as doubt existed , @entity6 was right not to give the penalty			2
had it been a foul , it would have been a red card as well			0
@entity40 got the wrong side of @entity39 before the defender caught him from behind @entity39 was attempting to clearer but @entity40 got his body between himself and the ball toure was sure it was a penalty , which surely would have resulted in a second sending off for @entity60 3			2
@entity61 on @entity13 ( 61mins ) - makeshift centre - half @entity61 was drawn into tripping @entity13 as the brilliant @entity32 weaved across the penalty area			2
ten years ago , almost to the day ( november 7 ) i reffed a @entity66 derby at @entity67 and denied a host of penalty claims for the home side			1
sir @entity71 waited in the tunnel and after berating me claimed that ‘ to get a penalty my player would have had to be felled with an axe ! ’ i guess @entity76 must feel the same			0
the red cards ( that were ... and were n't ) 1			0
@entity79 ( 39mins ) - the one red card that was issued is beyond dispute : @entity79 ’s first yellow card was a routine one , but not mandatory , when he raised his leg to stop @entity85 kicking the ball from hand			1
the second yellow was for a poorly timed tackle on @entity89 which was as clear a caution as you could see			0
no choice for the referee but to send him off			0
@entity85 ( 31mins ) - @entity97 keeper could have been red carded when , for some inexplicable reason , he raced out of his goal to challenge @entity6 over a decision			1
@entity85 appeared to overrun and get too close to the referee			2
his head appeared to go down and into @entity6 ’s face ( below ) which left the referee the option to dismiss			2
@entity85 approaches @entity6 near the half - way line after being incensed by @entity79 's block on him 3			1
@entity39 - if the @entity40 incident was a foul , then a red card would have had to follow for the @entity60 defender			0
perhaps it was this fact which swayed @entity6 into ignoring the penalty claims and blowing for half - time instead			1
@entity39 had a day to forget at the @entity116 , going off injured in the second - half after struggling the lessons 1			1
be brave - give penalties even in the furnace that is a @entity66 derby			0
in the case of @entity12 and @entity13 , if you do n’t give the penalty , you need to deal with the aftermath			1
@entity12 could have been booked for raging in @entity13 ’s face , but @entity6 just ran away from the scene			1
you have to deal with behaviour like that or it can escalate			0
get wide – you see contact better from side on and too many referees are lazy and stay central due to the pace of the modern game			0
use advantage wisely - yes , it ’s good to let the game flow but there is a balance			0
those who are fouled can feel aggrieved and seek retribution			0
we saw this happen on a number of occasions after @entity149 and @entity40 had been fouled			0
referee @entity6 rode his luck as the penalty decisions did n’t affect @entity16 winning the game at the final whistle @entity6 appeared to breathe a sigh of relief and smiled			1
he knows that he rode his luck as the penalty decisions did n’t affect @entity16 winning the game			2
he is a promising referee who is being pushed ahead of the controversial @entity159 , but he is by no means the finished article yet .			0

there were three big penalty claims at the @entity116
@entity12 brought @entity13 down but nothing was given
@entity79 's sending off was n't in doubt , but @entity85 and @entity39 *risked* more dismissals in @entity16 's 1 - 0 win
referee @entity6 rode his luck on occasion in the derby
