just over a month ago @entity1 ’s team arrived in @entity2 with the mentality of champions			1
they bullied and beat everything in sight			2
ask @entity8 , a late substitute in the @entity9 , what it takes to be a @entity13 winner and he will tell you			1
‘ you think a @entity17 team reaches the last eight of the @entity13 ? ’ he snorted after they needed extra-time to beat @entity21 2 - 1 in @entity22			1
on sunday they hit all their targets			2
so , too , does their coach			2
he raised four fingers at @entity41 airport to signal their intent to win win a fourth @entity13			1
now he can flick two fingers at anyone who doubted him			2
this has been a @entity46 for the @entity48 lookalike , with near misses in the final of @entity51 , the @entity13 semi-final in 2010 and the last four of @entity53			1
here they have been regarded as the best prepared team at the tournament for some time : best players , best training ground , best coach , best everything			2
however much they will crow about the number of coaches in @entity27 after their fourth triumph , it takes a special unit to be together for seven weeks			1
it is far more than tricks and flicks			2
this was a target tournament , something every player involved with the @entity76 national team had made abundantly clear as they criss - crossed their way around this incredible country			2
if it felt and sounded ballsy , they backed it up on the biggest stage of all			0
they are footballing gods now			0
from @entity27 with @entity1 : the @entity27 boss celebrates at the final whistle low , along with some of the world ’s finest footballers - @entity92 , @entity93 and , well , the list is endless - are staring down from heaven now			1
quite how @entity28 , @entity2 , @entity96 , @entity97 and others - yes , even @entity99 - retaliate remains to be seen			1
it hurts to even type it			0
this team is @entity1 ’s baby now and by end the time the final whistle went , everyone involved with the @entity76 national team was blubbing			1
@entity30 got the goal , beautifully taken on his chest with the first touch and rifled beyond @entity109 with his second after 113 minutes			1
they had been rough around the edges until then and yet , somehow , you always knew they were going to win it			2
no matter how good @entity27 ’s squad is , dealing with an unexpected event - an injury to one of their most influential players before kick - off - is never easy			1
whatever happened in those moments after @entity125 pulled up lame in the warm - up , it upset @entity27 ’s rhythm			1
it threw them out of kilter			0
even @entity125 ’s replacement did n’t last long , with @entity132 taken off with a head injury after just 32 minutes			0
soon enough @entity135 ’s @entity134 was on			0
injury blow : influential @entity27 midfielder @entity125 watches on from the touchline out clod : @entity132 had to be substituted after being flattened by @entity139 watching on : @entity125 's girlfriend @entity140 show her support from the stands cheerleaders : @entity125 looks nervous alongside substitutes @entity144 ( left ) and @entity8 still , @entity27 expects and the problem , after victories over @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity21 , @entity150 and that extraordinary win over @entity2 , is that so did everybody else			1
after victory here , it does n’t matter that those powerful powerful combinations we have become accustomed to were spluttering			0
@entity93 and @entity158 down the right ; @entity160 and @entity161 in the centre ; @entity164 and @entity163 through the middle			0
@entity160 was unsettled , ruffled by the menacing presence of @entity167 and @entity168 in the centre of midfield			0
it was congested and dirty at times			0
off colour : @entity27 playmaker @entity160 was far from at his best in the final the two @entity175 are the types to wait in dark alleys in the dead of night and rob you blind of all your gear			1
@entity183 ’ elementary first half mistake , a dopey , looping header over the top of @entity186 and his defensive partner @entity187 gave @entity188 a free run on goal			0
@entity160 had a couple of chances , the best of them he sent wide of @entity109 ’s left hand post			0
we had come to expect better from one of the stars of the tournament , but low can pick over the bones of this performance at a later date			0
all that counts is the fact that this victory - the first by a @entity209 team on south @entity149 soil - has been in the calendar for quite some time			0
pointing the finger : @entity158 looks incensed after being fouled in the first - half video @entity76 fans take to the beach in clebration			0

@entity27 beat @entity28 win the @entity13 after extra-time
@entity30 scores *volleyed* winner in 113th minute
manager @entity1 has been in charge since 2006
@entity1 's young side have been slowly building towards *glory*
