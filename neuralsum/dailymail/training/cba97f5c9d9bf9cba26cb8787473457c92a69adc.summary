two sisters have sued the founders of @entity2 for using their images without permission to promote the popular app. @entity6 and @entity7 , who both live in @entity9 , say cofounders @entity10 and @entity12 caused them ' emotional distress , embarrassment and the loss of pecuniary value of the use of their photographs , images and likenesses ’ when they led them to believe that their pictures , which they took for free in 2011 , would be used for a ' class project '			1
in most of the pictures , the girls - who were 18 and 19 years old at the time - are shown on the beach in bathing suits			0
one of the images , however , is cropped to make them appear naked , as if one sister is pulling the other one 's top off , according to the lawsuit			2
mr @entity10 also used @entity7 's image when he was promoting the app in its early days			2
in a pitch to blog @entity59 , he said of @entity7 : ' the girl who modeled in our @entity54 screenshots is from @entity63 and very good looking			0
' he then attached her picture to the email as ' proof			0
' now , more than three years later , the sisters claim that the app 's ' tawdry reputation as being a " sexting app " ' has tarnished their own personae			0
as an example , the lawsuit points out , the @entity75 ' images appears when you type ' snapchat slut ' into @entity55			1
to make matters worse , their photos , they say , have helped @entity2 grow into one of the world 's most popular apps			2
it was recently valued at $ 10billion - and they have n't received a penny			1
scandalous ! while some of the pictures are innocent , the lawsuit points to a picture ( on the right ) that is cropped to make the girls appear naked will they get any money ? snapchat did make the sisters sign a model release form , but it said they pictures could be used for @entity97 only - and @entity2 is now extremely popular on @entity98 the younger of the two sisters , @entity7 , was first contacted in 2011 by mr @entity10 , who was then a student at @entity100 , asking her to come pose for pictures at his @entity103 , @entity104 , home , according to the lawsuit			1
@entity7 , who was doing some professional modeling at the time , said she would come only if her sister @entity6 could come along			1
mr @entity10 and mr @entity12 photographed the sisters at various locations in @entity110			0
they were reportedly told that the pictures would be used for ' a school project			1
' three days after the photo shoot , mr @entity10 sent the @entity75 a model release form , which they both signed			0
in the document , @entity2 - which was then called @entity115 - was given all rights to the pictures for the purpose of promoting the app ' for @entity97			1
' ( the app is also available on @entity122			0
) the document also said the @entity75 would not be paid for their participation - and that @entity2 would not be responsible for ' any expense or liability incurred as a result of [ the girls ' ] participation			0
' almost twins ! @entity6 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) were 19 and 18 , respectively , at the time the pictures were taken intentionally deceptive ? snapchat cofounder @entity10 initially contacted the @entity75 in 2011 earlier this year , @entity2 was accused by the @entity133 of deceiving customers about the disappearing nature of messages sent through its @entity138 company and the @entity133 were able to reach a settlement			1
even amidst the legal troubles , @entity2 is growing rapidly : almost a third of 18 - to 24 - year - olds use the app ( that 's more than double the amount of users the company had last november ) .			2

@entity6 and @entity7 ’s images appears in @entity55 after a search for ' @entity2 sluts , ' the lawsuit says
they pair was reportedly told their pictures would be used for ' a school project ' when they were taken for free in 2011
the popular app was recently valued at $ 10billion
