one spellbinding attraction of @entity1 is that he lives his career on the very edge			1
when it pays off , he is a hero			0
but on saturday , straining for supremacy under the desert sky , he slipped off the track on his final qualifying lap and missed out on pole position			1
that accolade , ahead of the @entity11 , went to his @entity13 team - mate @entity12 , who was three - tenths of a second faster			1
' @entity1 has gone off , ' he was told over the radio			1
well done , pole position			2
' eyes on the prize : @entity12 will start sunday 's @entity11 from pole position frontrunner : @entity12 denied @entity22 team - mate @entity1 a hat - trick of poles for the season so far it was the first time this season that @entity12 , the championship leader having won the opening race of the season in @entity30 and finished second behind @entity1 in @entity31 last week , had beaten his old friend in qualifying			1
he held a single finger up behind @entity1 's head as they posed for pictures afterwards			1
the beaten man tried his best to raise a smile as the cameras clicked but it looked an understandably forced gesture made for form 's sake			2
he is always most annoyed when he is responsible for an error			0
this was a case in point , for the @entity22 driver had been dominant in practice and surely realised that by locking up at the first corner of the last lap he had denied himself a probable third consecutive pole position			2
' you ca n't always get it right , ' he sighed			0
fastest three : @entity1 , @entity12 and @entity58 's @entity57 were the quickest in qualifying all class : @entity12 impressed on the @entity61 despite trailing @entity1 through practice @entity63 will start at the back of the grid after a five - place penalty following qualifying			1
@entity63 was found guilty of forcing @entity69 ' @entity68 off the @entity61 ' in an unsafe manner ' towards the end of the opening 18 - minute session			2
the @entity74 was forced to take evasive action to avoid being hit by the @entity77 driver , although still managed to make it through to @entity79 , whilst @entity63 could only qualify 18th			1
but after a stewards ' hearing @entity63 will now line up 22nd and last			0
his mistake means @entity12 will start as favourite on the track where his career began nine seasons ago by his setting the fastest lap for @entity88			1
the race would appear to be nicely set up			0
' it has just worked well through the weekend , ' said the @entity91			0
' i have found my way , made progress and resolved some issues			2
' the challenge this weekend is that free practice was in such hot conditions and you have to guess what is needed in the cold conditions for qualifying			0
' what he did not mention was that he roared to pole despite having badly cut his big toe when his left foot came into collision with a rock while running in @entity109			2
his left foot , we note , only his braking foot			0
brave face : @entity1 shows no disappointment after his team - mate snatched the front spot from him bright lights : @entity1 winds up his mercedes in the marginally cooler night air in @entity61 @entity57 again performed brilliantly in his @entity58 , pressing his claims as the early revelation of the season by finishing third fastest , albeit a second off @entity12 's mark			1
however , the 10 - place grid penalty @entity57 carries over for being released unsafely in the pits in @entity31 condemns him to start 13th			1
the poor boy , disqualified in @entity30 , is on an awful streak of bad luck			0
' my season has been going well but i do n't have the points to show for it , ' he said			0
' i do n't need to be conservative tomorrow , but to go for more points			0
' it was a good day for @entity88 , with @entity134 and @entity135 due to start third and fourth after @entity57 's penalty is taken into consideration			1
@entity138 , of @entity139 will line up in sixth place			0
off track , more discussions to discuss the quieter engine noise are planned for sunday .			0

@entity12 on pole for sunday 's @entity11
@entity1 will start *alongside* @entity13 team - mate on the front row
@entity57 was third , but will start in 13th after serving grid penalty
@entity152 failed to progress from @entity79 for the second time this season
