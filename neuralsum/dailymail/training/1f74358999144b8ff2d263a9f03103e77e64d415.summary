the @entity0 are in court today to suppress further allegations about sexual misconduct by one of their mps			1
the party is already accused of trying to hush up details of the claims against @entity10 , who is said to have made sexual advances toward a vulnerable constituent			1
although the allegations were first made three years ago , the mp was not suspended until this week when a report into the case was leaked online			1
yesterday there were accusations of a second cover - up after @entity0 - controlled @entity20 – where mr @entity10 is a councillor – said it would ask the @entity22 to halt the release of the independent report			1
@entity0 mp @entity10 , pictured leaving his own in @entity26 , @entity27 this morning , is accused of making unwanted advances towards a constituent the move will cost taxpayers thousands of pounds even when a redacted version of the document is online			1
written by a @entity35 , it found ‘ credible ’ evidence that the 67 - year - old was guilty of ‘ serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour ’			2
the 39 - year - old alleged victim , known as @entity40 or @entity41 , is in the midst of a civil case against the mp which she launched after police decided not to pursue the matter			0
yesterday the mother - of - one told the @entity47 that @entity0 leader @entity49 ’s handling of the affair was ‘ absolutely disgusting ’ and she had considered taking her own life			1
she said she felt ‘ hugely let down ’ , adding : ‘ the @entity0 have tried to sweep my complaints under the carpet			1
this should have been dealt with ages ago , in 2010 , when i first came forward , rather than now			0
‘ the whole of their party should all be held to account and they should hang their heads in shame			2
’ much of @entity63 ’s report , commissioned by the council for a code - of - conduct review into mr @entity10 , was blacked out when it was leaked online – and @entity41 has applied to see it all			1
the @entity69 and @entity70 groups on @entity20 want the report to be published , but they were overruled by @entity0 colleagues , who say solicitors have told them this should not happen until the civil case is over			1
mr @entity63 said there was no reason it should be kept under wraps			0
last night the @entity80 councillor who fought for the report to be published accused the @entity0 of a cover - up			1
the 39 - year - old alleged victim described @entity49 's handling of the affair as ' absolutely disgusting ' @entity86 said the party operated as an old boys ’ club interested only in protecting their own interests at the expense of women			2
and she said the leader of the council , @entity93 , was a personal friend of senior @entity0 @entity96 – meaning it was inconceivable the leadership in @entity99 did not know the seriousness of the allegations			1
she chaired a committee with two @entity0 councillors that reviewed complaints against mr @entity10 and said she was ‘ blocked at every turn ’ and then outvoted on the issue of publishing the report			1
‘ @entity10 ’s position has become completely untenable given the allegations against him , particularly against a vulnerable adult , ’ @entity108 told the @entity47			1

’ mr @entity10 was suspended on wednesday night by his party ’s hq in @entity99			1
however , as of last night , he had not been stripped of his role as cabinet member for planning on @entity20			0
@entity125 , solicitor for @entity20 , said : ‘ disclosure of the report is not necessary for the court to deal with the [ civil ] case – it can hear and test the evidence from both sides			2
‘ the report is part of the council ’s code - of - conduct process , which has been adjourned			0
it would be wrong for the report to be released before councillors holding a code - of - conduct hearing have been able to consider it and come to a decision			0
‘ the council has to deal fairly and responsibly with the information it holds			0
it is not the council ’s practice to disclose material as part of a court case in which it is not involved			0

it 's all about cover - up and protecting the party 's own interests at a cost to women ' local @entity0 were last night standing behind mr @entity10 and spoke out to criticise the party leadership			1
@entity162 , chairman of @entity163 , said : ‘ @entity10 has loyally represented the people of @entity20 for over 40 years and he will continue to serve as an excellent constituency @entity166 and as a councillor			1
’ it emerged yesterday that mr @entity49 had known about the latest allegations since february last year – but had done nothing to discipline mr @entity10			1
he recently told his radio phone - in : ‘ we did receive a letter in february this year : you ’re right , we did receive a fuller letter from the complainant in february this year and i asked the chief whip to look into it			0
’ last night mr @entity93 refused to respond to media enquiries about his role in the @entity10 case or the mp ’s future in @entity20			1
