when prince @entity1 wrote passionately of protecting ‘ beautiful landscapes with hedgerows ’ and the ‘ folly ’ of losing farmland , he captured the public mood			2
however , his cover article for the latest edition of @entity9 , has enraged farmers and nature lovers at the very heart of his @entity14 estate			2
the reason ? just compare the following two photographs			2
@entity17 : the @entity19 's @entity18 last year when it was peaceful , rolling farmlands @entity22 : the valley as a development consortium which will include a @entity26 supermarket when prince @entity1 wrote passionately of protecting ‘ beautiful landscapes with hedgerows ’ and the ‘ folly ’ of losing farmland , he captured the public mood one shows the @entity19 ’s @entity18 last year when it was peaceful , rolling farmland , lined with ancient hedgebanks and sown with maize to feed a 200 - strong dairy herd			1
the other shows it today as a development consortium – which includes the @entity19 – builds a @entity26 supermarket , housing estate , car park and recycling centre			1
one furious critic has described it as ‘ hypocrisy with a capital h ’			2
@entity49 approved the £ 40 million complex last year			1
it includes a ‘ @entity52 ’ and an @entity54 - funded park - and - ride scheme aimed at cutting traffic through @entity57 ’s historic streets			1
about a third of the 97 houses are to be ‘ affordable ’			2
the @entity19 , which donated the 55 - acre site and leased part back to the county council at peppercorn rent , says the authority asked it to provide a ‘ sustainable ’ solution to traffic congestion while easing a housing crisis			1
however critics , led by @entity71 , say the project has delivered precisely what the @entity1 is railing against – the destruction of high - quality farmland and a precious rural landscape			1
they claim it will do little to ease either traffic or housing problems , and will compete with small food producers for business			2
for its part the @entity19 can point to a judicial review which has dismissed the city council ’s fears and backed planning approval			1
a spokesman said the estate was asked by planners in 2005 to donate land for ‘ the growing needs of the local community ’			2
she insisted the site was not prime agricultural land and that 6,000 trees would be planted once landscaping was complete			0
@entity99 : the article in @entity9 's november 12 edition has enraged farmers and nature lovers @entity104 : the protest sign at the @entity18 , in the @entity14 estate , was quickly ripped down ‘ the duchy would not have become involved if it was not absolutely convinced of the sustainable benefits of the scheme , ’ she said			1
in his @entity9 article , @entity1 writes : ‘ it would not only be a folly to lose agricultural land , it would be equally foolish to use it in ways that are not environmentally sustainable in the long - term			2
’ he describes the countryside as ‘ that delicately woven tapestry ’ and warns : ‘ start pulling out the threads and the rest unravels very rapidly indeed and is very difficult to put back again – no farmers , no beautiful landscapes with hedgerows and stone walls , no thriving rural communities			0
’ @entity128 , founder of the @entity57 campaign , described the article as ‘ truly breathtaking ’ , adding : ‘ @entity1 writes of protecting and nurturing the very farmland his people are busy destroying in @entity14			0
‘ he cares about farmers and the countryside only until they get in the way of his own financial interests			0
then he pushes them out			0
‘ in this case a @entity19 tenant farmer has had to sell his dairy herd because he can no longer feed them			1
prime productive land has been lost and a beautiful valley destroyed			0
’ he said there were suspicions the @entity19 and @entity26 , which has exclusive rights to sell the organic food brand @entity145 , had become commercially too close			1
fellow campaign leader @entity147 said her protest sign – ‘ this valley destroyed thanks to prince @entity1 and 11 @entity149 ’ – had been quickly ripped down			0
‘ we had to keep rescuing it from the refuse dump , ’ she said			0
‘ but we are mere mortals and powerless against the @entity19			1
the @entity156 ’s comments in @entity9 beggar belief			0
he is the destroyer of @entity159 is hypocrisy with a capital h. ’ among the formal objectors were the @entity163 and @entity164			0
secretary @entity165 said : ‘ we felt this proposal was wrong			0
we need every bit of productive land we can get			0
we ’re all young farmers			0
this is our future being sold off			0
’ @entity171 , chairman of @entity172 , said that the @entity19 - @entity26 partnership would hit city centre trade by 8 per cent			1
‘ they ’re not looking after small farmers and producers , ’ he added			0
‘ the so - called @entity52 is just another outlet for the big boys			1
’ @entity26 said : ‘ we can confirm that we will be a tenant of the @entity14 after originally being approached by @entity49			1

@entity49 approved the £ *40million* complex last year
it will include a ' @entity52 ' and a park - and - ride scheme
there are concerns the @entity19 and @entity26 are commercially too close
