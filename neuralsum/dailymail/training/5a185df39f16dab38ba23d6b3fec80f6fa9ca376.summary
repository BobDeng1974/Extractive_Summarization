by @entity0 you might think that as one of the world 's top oil producing nations , the @entity2 would have little use for solar energy			1
but that has n't stopped the @entity10 state from unveiling the largest concentrated solar power plant in operation anywhere in the world			1
the 100 - megawatt solar - thermal project in @entity16 will power thousands of homes in the country and , it is hoped , displace approximately 175,000 tons of co2 per year			1
the world 's largest : the @entity22 concentrated solar energy power plant in @entity16 features more than 258,000 mirrors mounted on 768 tracking parabolic trough collectors , covering an area of 2.5 sq / km shiny : by concentrating heat from direct sunlight onto oil - filled pipes , @entity22 produces steam , which drives a turbine to generate electricity powerful : in addition , the solar project uses a booster to heat steam as it enters the turbine to dramatically increase the cycle 's efficiency harvesting the power of light : in the sweltering heat of the @entity45 sun , @entity42 1 generates electricity to power 20,000 homes in the @entity2 the $ 600million ( £ 398million ) project dubbed @entity22 took three years to build			1
incorporating the latest in parabolic trough technology , the plant features more than 258,000 mirrors mounted on 768 tracking parabolic trough collectors , covering an area of 2.5 sq / km , or 285 football fields			1
by concentrating heat from direct sunlight onto oil - filled pipes , @entity22 produces steam , which drives a turbine to generate electricity			2
in addition , the solar project uses a booster to heat steam as it enters the turbine to dramatically increase the cycle 's efficiency			0
the project also includes a dry - cooling system that significantly reduces water consumption - a critical advantage in the arid desert of western @entity16			2
useful : because power is generated during peak demand the @entity42 1 reduce the need for ' peak shaving ' generators , which are expensive and idle most of the year look upon my works , ye mighty : @entity82 , @entity2 president @entity81 third - left ) during the official inauguration of the plant			1
it works by concentrating heat from direct sunlight onto oil - filled pipes to produce steam which drives a turbine to generate electricity ( see diagram , right ) ' abundance of solar energy ' : the president ( third - left on the left hand picture ) listens to dr @entity97 ( second - left ) minister of state of the @entity2 and the managing director and chief executive officer of @entity101			1
on the right picture president @entity81 and dr @entity97 look at a commemorative sundial in the sweltering heat of the @entity45 sun , @entity42 1 generates electricity to power 20,000 homes in the @entity2			1
and because solar power is generated during peak demand the @entity2 is able to reduce the need for ' peak shaving ' generators , which are expensive and idle most of the year			1
@entity101 , @entity16 's renewable energy company , partnered with @entity117 energy company @entity116 and @entity119 's energy infrastructure company @entity118 to build the plant			2
' @entity10 holds nearly half of the world 's renewable energy potential , ' said @entity124 , ceo of @entity125			0
' the abundance of solar energy is an opportunity to integrate sustainable , clean sources of power that address energy security and climate change			0
' the region needs more projects like @entity22 , and we look forward to pushing the boundaries of future energy			0
' under construction : the $ 600million ( £ 398million ) project took three years to build			0
@entity101 , @entity16 's renewable energy company , partnered with @entity117 energy company @entity116 and @entity119 's energy infrastructure company @entity118 to build the ambitious plant proud : the men and women behind @entity22 pose for a picture in front of the new plant dr @entity97 , ceo of @entity101 , said : ' the inauguration of @entity22 is a major breakthrough for renewable energy in the @entity10			0
' just like the rest of the word , the region is faced with meeting its rising demand for energy , while also working to reduce its carbon footprint			0
' @entity22 is a significant milestone , as large - scale renewable energy is proving it can deliver electricity that is sustainable , affordable and secure			0
' he added : ' @entity16 is investing and incubating a new energy industry , domestically and internationally			0
through @entity101 , the @entity2 is redefining the role it plays in providing the world with energy			2
' from precious hydrocarbon exports to sophisticated renewable energy systems , we are balancing the energy mix and diversifying our economy - moving toward a more sustainable future			0
' today , the @entity2 is the only @entity171 nation delivering both hydrocarbons and renewable energy to the international market			2

100 - megawatt plant will power thousands @entity2 homes
it is hoped that it will also displace 175,000 tons of @entity181 each year
plant covers 2.5 sq / km of desert , *equivalent* to 285 football pitches
