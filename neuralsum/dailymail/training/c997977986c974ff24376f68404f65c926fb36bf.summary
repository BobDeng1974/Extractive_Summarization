the sir @entity1 swipeometer , for years the unofficial barometer of a @entity5 club 's success , has sadly been mothballed following the former @entity8 manager 's retirement			1
for years it was @entity10 who found themselves at the receiving end of @entity1 's caustic comments , until they stopped being a threat			2
@entity17 's @entity16 appeared only to have to smile his enigmatic smile to rile the managerial @entity19 of @entity20			0
videos scroll down to watch @entity8 achieved unprecedented success under sir @entity1 but have struggled since his retirement @entity24 scores against @entity25 at @entity26 in 1996 when @entity8 were clear top dogs in @entity28 @entity1 would often feud with rival @entity16 at a time when @entity25 were n't even on the @entity32 's radar @entity33 and @entity34 celebrate the ' noisy neighbours ' 6 - 1 win at @entity37 in october 2011 city league titles : 4 @entity41 cups : 0 @entity42 cups : 5 @entity43 : 3 @entity8 league titles : 20 @entity41 cups : 3 @entity45 wins : 11 @entity43 : 4 @entity46 - to - head @entity25 wins : 42 , @entity8 wins : 59 , draws : 49			1
when it came to the ' other ' club in @entity28 , however , well they were miles off @entity1 's radar for years			2
then along came a @entity53 takeover , some serious spending and a genuine rivalry for silverware and @entity25 were paid the biggest compliment of all – @entity1 described them as ' small with a small mentality ' and branded them the ' noisy neighbours '			1
that was the point that @entity25 finally got under the skin of a manager who could see the axis of power shifting to the east of @entity28			1
admittedly , the decision to plaster a huge poster of @entity71 striker @entity70 all over @entity72 with a ' welcome to @entity28 ' message was pretty well guaranteed to irritate @entity1 and everyone at @entity37			0
talking the talk has evolved into walking the walk			0
look at the @entity5 table for the last four years and it has a very northern hue			1
@entity25 or @entity8 , @entity8 or @entity25			1
@entity1 has gone , @entity80 has come and gone , @entity81 has gone and now it is @entity83 versus @entity84			0
@entity8 won the @entity85 in 1999 - the same year rivals @entity25 were playing in the third tier @entity88 scores against @entity89 at @entity90 as @entity25 went on to win on penalties to earn promotion @entity25 soon got under the skin of @entity8 - thanks to their takeover - starting with this @entity70 poster after decades of living in @entity8 's shadow , the @entity5 champions are now the best team in the city @entity8 are in a lowly eighth place on 13 points while @entity25 are in third but only four points better off			1
no - one would suggest that @entity25 are the poor relations any more			1
the reverse could be argued			0
yet it was only in 2001 that the clubs reached a fork in the road which would see @entity25 relegated while @entity8 went from strength to strength on the back of their 1999 treble - winning season			1
most people would remember 2001 and @entity37 for @entity114 's assault on @entity115 but it was also the season city slipped out of the @entity5			1
@entity114 peers over @entity115 following an horrendous tackle on the @entity25 midfielder even though @entity8 did not regard their noisy neighbours as a serious threat in terms of @entity5 position , local bragging rights were just as important			1
there have been some memorable derbies , not always for the right reasons			0
@entity129 's bleeding head from a thrown coin blighted the 2012 meeting in which @entity132 also tackled a pitch invader after @entity135 's late winner to make it 3 - 1			0
city fans will remember the 2007 - 8 season with fondness as that was the first double since 1969 when @entity140 was hearing it through the grapevine and @entity142 was taking delivery of a brand new @entity144 , whatever that is			2
@entity129 holds his head during a clash in december 2012 after being struck on the head by a thrown coin two years later the derby was labelled the best @entity5 game of the season			1
@entity8 4 , @entity25 3 with @entity154 scoring the winner in the fifth minute of injury time			1
@entity154 said recently , annoyingly referring to himself in the first person : ' i think if you ask any @entity8 fan what was the best ¬ moment of @entity154 's time here they 'd all say that derby goal – and it 's probably the stand - out moment for me too			2
' it 's a special memory because it won us a memorable derby and was in front of the @entity169 – the fans do n't forget something like that			2
' @entity8 's @entity154 celebrates his injury - time winner against @entity25 during 2009 's seven - goal thriller neither do the players			1
@entity177 , who appeared close to signing for @entity25 at one point until he was given a bumper new deal by @entity8 , settled the @entity37 clash in 2010 - 11 with a bicycle kick			1
this is how he described it in his autobiography : ' i 'm @entity177			0
i 've played @entity5 football since 2002 and i 've just scored the winning goal in a @entity28 derby – probably the most important game of the season to fans from the red half of town			1
' a goal that puts our noisy neighbours – the other lot – in their place			0
a goal that reminds them @entity8 have more history and more success than they do right now			2
a goal that warns the rest of the country we 're on our way to winning another @entity5 title			2
@entity177 scores one of the @entity5 's greatest goals with an over-head kick in february 2011 ' as i stand with my arms spread wide , head back , i can feel the hate coming from the @entity25 fans behind me , it 's like static electricity			1
the abuse , the screaming and swearing , is bouncing off me			0
i do n't give a toss			0
' i know how much they hate me ; i can understand where they are coming from though , because i go through the same emotions whenever i lose at anything			0
' this time , they 're wound up and i 'm not			0
i know it does n't get any better than this			0
' as i jog back to the centre circle , still tingling , i go into rewind			0
it 's ridiculous , i know , but i 'm worried i might never feel this way again			0
i want to remember what 's just happened , to relive the moment over and over because it feels so good			0
' @entity177 holds his arms out to celebrate the goal and admitted ' it does n't get any better than this ' in his book back to @entity25 and another hugely important result			2
@entity242 stopped @entity8 from reaching a ninth @entity45 final as @entity25 went on to win their first major trophy since 1976			1
( @entity246 top fo the charts with ' @entity248 ' )			0
the to - ing and fro - ing continues with @entity8 taking @entity45 revenge in 2011 - 12 while @entity25 made the biggest noise of all when they thumped @entity252 6 - 1 at @entity37			1
@entity253 was sent off and @entity25 scored three goals in injury time			2
a certain @entity256 grabbed two , just after letting off fireworks in his house , while @entity259 , @entity33 and @entity260 chipped in as well			0
and so to sunday , where there may be fireworks but no flares , please			0
@entity260 hits @entity25 's fifth past @entity266 as the blue half of @entity28 claimed a 6 - 1 win at @entity37 former @entity25 striker @entity256 reveals his infamous ' @entity270 ? ' shirt after scoring in the 2011 win			2

@entity8 *enjoyed* years of *dominance* as @entity25 struggled
however , the @entity275 have been *overtaken* by @entity25 in recent years
