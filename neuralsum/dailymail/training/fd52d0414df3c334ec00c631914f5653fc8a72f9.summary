@entity5 , 34 , from @entity6 in @entity7 , required a skin graft after a venomous false widow bit him in 2011 , and has reacted badly to all insects ever since			1
the care - home worker has now been hospitalised four times in two years after encounters with bugs saying he ' blows up ' like @entity16 from @entity17 every time he is bitten			1
nightmare : bodybuilder @entity5 has been hospitalised four times because of insect bites since he was first bitten by a false widow spider in 2011 , leaving him requiring a skin graft ( right ) the worrying revelation comes just a day after a school in @entity25 was closed because of a false widow infestation			1
yesterday the @entity27 also reported a grandfather nearly died and came close to having his leg amputated following a severe reaction to a false widow bite			0
last week , mr @entity5 required hospital treatment after a midge bit him in the chest and four weeks early he was taken to @entity35 after being bitten by a red mite			1
he said : ' my immune system is shot , basically , and when i ’m bitten i blow up like that girl off @entity17			2
i ’ve been back in hospital four times since that first bite			2
' mr @entity5 was tending to his allotment when the poisonous spider bit him in 2011			1
he said he swelled up ' like a boxing glove ' and at one stage was told by doctors his arm may have to be amputated			0
' i told them " you ca n’t take my arm off , i work , i go to the gym five times a week "			2
' i go swimming and fishing			0
they told me they would have to cut out part of my arm and i would be left with a really big scar , but it was either that or lose my arm			0
' @entity61 : last week the 34 - year - old was treated at @entity63 in @entity7 after a midge bit him on his chest after the flesh had been removed , he had a skin graft taken from his leg to cover the hole left in his arm			1
he was off work recovering for seven months and was left with a permanent scar			0
he said : ' ironically , before i was bitten by the spider , i lived in @entity75 for six months and saw huntsman spiders , red widows , swam with crocodiles and sharks and never had anything bad happen to me			1
' mr @entity5 , who works at @entity81 in @entity7 , has seen his life altered forever , but says he tries not to let it overwhelm him			1
' i do n’t think about it too much , ' he said			0
' if it ’s going to happen it ’s going to happen , i ca n’t stay inside for the rest of my life			0
' rest : he was off work recovering for seven months after the bite in 2011 moving around : there has been a spate of spiders reported around the country in the past week the false black widow , which is said to be spreading further north due to warmer weather , has the worst bite of any spider in the @entity100			1
there have been a spate of bites reported across the country in the past few weeks			0
@entity107 footballer @entity106 , for instance , had to undergo emergency surgery after a bite on his leg last week			0
the spider is a cousin of the black widow and is about the size of a 50p piece			2
it delivers venom that can kill those who are allergic to it			0
it first came to the @entity100 more than 100 years ago in crates of fruit from the @entity123			0
the @entity125 ’s @entity124 hears of about ten cases of spider bites each year , although no one in the @entity100 has ever died as a result of one			2
the distribution of the false widow spider is expected to increase northwards in the @entity100 due , at least partly , to mild summers in recent years .			2
