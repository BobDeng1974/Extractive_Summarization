@entity0 produced a dominant forward display to overwhelm @entity3 's pack and claim a 36 - 8 triumph at the @entity5			1
@entity6 gave @entity3 a 3 - 0 lead via a penalty , but @entity0 dominated the rest of the half and scores from @entity12 , @entity13 and a penalty try opened up a 22 - 3 advantage for the hosts			1
the @entity19 claimed the bonus - point when they were awarded a second penalty try and , even though the @entity22 scored a consolation through @entity24 , @entity18 's touchdown rubberstamped the victory for the @entity19			2
@entity18 of @entity0 scores a second half try during the @entity29 match against @entity3 @entity19 scrum - half @entity30 throws out the ball with his side leading the way against @entity3 both teams went into this game with identical records having secured two wins from six matches , but @entity3 would have been more content with their start to the campaign			1
@entity43 's men have already played all of last season 's top - four , taking a surprise 22 - 19 victory over @entity48 at @entity49 in the process , and they scored first here through the boot of @entity6			2
however , without @entity53 to control proceedings from centre , who has been outstanding in their first six @entity29 encounters , they were soon on the back foot			0
although the @entity22 escaped when @entity0 could not quite capitalise on a charge down kick , they were n't so fortunate a few minutes later			2
instead of opting for the posts following a @entity3 infringement at the scrum , the @entity19 decided to go for the lineout inside the opposition 22 and it paid dividends			0
despite the visitors halting the initial maul , @entity43 's side eventually succumbed to the pressure and @entity12 went over from close range			0
@entity74 gets stuck in to @entity75 as he and his team - mates try to retreive the ball from @entity3 @entity74 uses his pace and agility to evade the clutches of @entity3 winger @entity81 @entity74 , continuing his fine form this season , added the extras and the hosts led 7 - 3			1
the fly - half then had a chance to extend their lead after @entity13 had broken through the heart of @entity3 rearguard and he duly converted the opportunity as the home team moved seven points clear			2
@entity0 were now very much on the front foot and , after @entity97 had received a yellow card for a cynical offence at the breakdown , they scored again , this time through @entity101			0
with the @entity19 ' driving game proving destructive , @entity3 could not cope and referee @entity103 awarded a penalty try and also sin - binned back - rower @entity105			1
to the visitors ' credit , despite being down to 13 men at the start of the second period , they held out until @entity97 's return , but they could not resist the barrage and @entity114 awarded a second penalty try			0
@entity116 of @entity19 ( far left ) is tackled by @entity6 of @entity3 ( centre and right ) @entity116 steps away from the @entity3 players during their victory at the @entity5 on saturday even at that point it was effectively game over , although the @entity22 briefly sprung into life when @entity124 's 50 - metre burst almost resulted in a score , but an outstanding cover tackle prevented the winger from grounding the ball			1
with nothing to lose , @entity3 looked to move the ball from deep and they created opportunities before they finally touched down through @entity132			0
however , the final word was justifiably left to the @entity135 outfit as @entity136 broke through and off - loaded to @entity137 to go over .			0

@entity0 *defeated* @entity3 in convincing victory at the @entity5
both teams went into the game having won two of their prior six matches
despite going 3 - 0 down @entity0 came back to dominate for most of the game
