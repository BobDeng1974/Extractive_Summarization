by @entity0 published : 06:09 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 06:19 est , 4 april 2013 from a roast turkey to a prime beefburger and a moreish @entity5 bun , this is a feast that no one could fail to enjoy			0
provided you like cake , of course			2
every single part of the strikingly realistic - looking array is made from sponge cake , from the turkey 's tomato garnish to the glass of @entity16 next to the burger			1
the amazing gateaux were created by @entity20 patissier , @entity21 , which , along with food , also makes cakes in the shape of guitars , dogs and designer bags among others			2
realistic : this turkey cake baffled people so successfully that someone tried to break its leg off could you tell the difference ? @entity36 's owl , @entity37 , and a burger and chips both made from cake breakfast cake : an astonishingly lifelike grapefruit half and a toothsome looking @entity5 bun the company , which has produced edible artworks for @entity46 , the @entity47 and @entity48 among others , was started by @entity50 over 25 years ago			1
@entity50 said : ' people are surprised at how realistic they look			1
we did a turkey cake for @entity54 once and someone pulled the leg off because they thought it was the actual turkey			2
" before i start making them i meet up with the customer to see what their needs are and volley a few ideas back and forth			0
' i try to do something special for them to make them laugh or so that they are deeply touched and make it as personable as possible			2
' @entity50 , who , along with her husband , has been decorating cakes for more than 30 years also revealed that the secret of her success is making sure each piece is as individually interesting as possible			1
' i draw a sketch - and we decide the size , colour scheme , flavours and which bits will be edible			0
i just start with a square or circle base and go from there			0
' i always try to do something fresh and give people more than just an object			0
' bagged it : this cake version of a @entity90 2:55 handbag is strikingly realistic and even comes with perfume spectacular : the diamond engagement ring and roses in this box may not be real but they certainly look it sandwich : everything from the lettuce to the bread is crafted by hand from sponge cake adorable : this cute pug cake looks so lifelike you almost want to pet it rather than cut a slice making the cakes can be a time - consuming business , and getting it right can take as much as three days per cake			1
' it usually takes a day to make a complete cake , ' she says			1
' but some projects have taken three days			2
i have a team of about four people who perform specific roles in the construction			0
' the hardest cake i worked on was one i did recently - a @entity124 and @entity123			0
that took three days to make and getting it right was really tough			1
' not surprisingly , @entity50 's edible art does n't come cheap , with cakes priced between $ 300 ( £ 200 ) and $ 10,000 ( £ 6,650 ) depending on how intricate the order is			1
interestingly , @entity50 's busiest time of year is n't the wedding season , but @entity132			1
' @entity132 is my favourite time , it 's so much fun			0
i always have fun doing those cakes , ' she reveals			0
' it 's stressful because you have a lot to put out in a short amount of time			0
you always wonder whether the cake will make it to the party of event			1
but i have a passion for it , so very day i get up and i 'm glad i have this job and make people happy			0
' i found my calling - it 's so creative and unique			0
