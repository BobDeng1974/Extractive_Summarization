@entity0 says he is ready to take on @entity2 ’s two left - arm @entity1 in the @entity3 – and has overcome the problems he had against the short ball during his introduction to @entity7 last summer			1
@entity0 is planning to join up with the @entity9 squad ahead of the second test in the @entity11 , starting in @entity12 on april 21 – having recovered more quickly from a rib injury than anyone expected			1
and he intends to put to good use the experience gained during the @entity17 , where he averaged 38 with a strike - rate of 105 – one of the few glimmers of light in an otherwise benighted tournament for @entity9			1
@entity0 will join up with @entity9 ahead of their second @entity24 after recovering quicker than expected form a rib injury @entity0 's performance in the @entity17 was a glimmer of light in a disappointing tournament for @entity9 when the @entity3 get going on july 8 @entity2 will undoubtedly bombard @entity0 with bouncers after he found a variety of ways to get out to the short ball against @entity34 and @entity35 last year – with @entity36 and @entity37 ready to unleash merry hell			1
but @entity0 , who was recently named one of @entity41 ’s @entity40 , said : ‘ it was something i was working on at the @entity17 in @entity2			1
and now i ’ve tasted a bit of @entity36 and @entity37 and these guys , i feel i ’m much more ready than i was last year			1
it was good for me to see that i can handle that kind of bowling			2
‘ i probably thought about the short ball too much in the end , and forgot about the rest of my batting			2
so i ’ve learned from that now , and hopefully i wo n’t ever do that again			2
’ @entity0 struggled with the short delivery against @entity34 and @entity35 ( pictured ) last year and for those who have not yet erased from their memories @entity36 ’s demolition job on @entity9 ’s batsmen during the 5 - 0 ashes whitewash in 2013 - 14 , @entity0 has some cautionary words			1
‘ i think @entity37 is quicker than @entity36 , ’ he said			2
‘ i think he ’ll be more dangerous than him because of the swing			2
but let ’s see what happens			0
i ’ve only faced @entity36 once , and that was his first game back , so maybe he ’s a bit quicker now			0
’ @entity0 , who hopes to play for @entity68 against @entity69 on sunday in the opening round of @entity72 matches , wants to establish himself as the test team ’s no 1 spinner			1
@entity0 says that he worked on facing short deliveries during the @entity17 earlier this year nineteen wickets at 23 against @entity35 last summer was a good start			1
and he has been working on his doosra , which was briefly unveiled against @entity34 at @entity79 a year ago , but has remained under wraps during the @entity82 ’s recent purge against dodgy bowling actions			0
‘ i feel like i ’m bowling it quite well , ’ he said			0
‘ it was n’t right at the time , but now that i feel like i ’ve got it right			0
but a lot of players got banned , so i ’ve got to err on the careful side of things			0
i think in the future i ’d definitely like to bowl it			0
‘ i feel like i ’m part of the team now			0
but i do n’t take anything for granted			0
i still play every game like it ’s my first and my last game			0
i ’m looking forward to going out to the @entity24 and performing			1

@entity0 will join up with @entity9 ahead of second @entity24
