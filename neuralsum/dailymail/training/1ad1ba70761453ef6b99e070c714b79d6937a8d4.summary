@entity1 has retired from international football after 114 caps and last month , just before his final cap , chief sports writer @entity0 wrote about how @entity5 failed their captain			1
it is pointless asking @entity1 where it all goes wrong			1
@entity1 is where it all goes wrong			1
not just in this tournament , not just with the odd mistake of a player raging against the dying of the light , but from the very start , from his earliest days as an international footballer			2
all those times when we looked and wondered what happened to the @entity1 we knew , the one in the red shirt , a hero of the modern game			1
that was it going wrong			2
that was it right there			2
it is impossible to stop at one			2
the second half of the @entity45 final ; the @entity47 final in 2006 ; that @entity45 tie against @entity49 in 2004 ; the 3 - 0 win over @entity51 in 2012 ; @entity52 in the @entity53 in 2010 ; as a 21 - year - old against @entity55 in 2001			2
@entity57 regulars would not stop there			2
they could add another 50 , maybe 100			2
@entity59 , @entity60 , 2001 ; @entity61 in 2008			0
games that @entity41 would not have won without @entity1 , the pumping heartbeat			1
now do the same with @entity1 and @entity5			1
several of those who have seen each one of his 113 appearances tried it yesterday			1
there was a consensus on @entity70 away in 2007 under @entity71			1
and not a whole lot else			0
he was very good when @entity5 beat @entity74 5 - 1 in @entity75 , but so were a lot of players			1
there was a friendly against @entity80 immediately after the @entity81 , when he stopped the @entity83 backlash reaching its shrill crescendo			0
and he was most consistent in the qualifying campaign for the @entity81 , albeit in a starting position on the left , which he hated			0
glorious : many @entity1 displays for @entity41 , particularly in @entity91 in 2005 , have been outstanding irregular : there have been fewer great displays for @entity5 , with the best arguably against @entity70 in 2007 yet @entity1 ’s malaise is @entity5 malaise			1
just as the national team is less than the sum of its parts , so his century of @entity5 appearances do not amount to his best 10 , maybe his best five , for @entity41			1
@entity1 , an admirable individual of great honesty and often given to brutal self - analysis , admits as much			1
on the occasion of his 100th cap , he said he had played six or seven good games for @entity5			1
it is generally agreed @entity1 has frequently hit a standard that justifies his inclusion			1
only very recently has his place in the team been questioned , and never by @entity112			2
he has asked @entity1 to stay as captain , and he will consider his future in the coming weeks			1
yet it is impossible to divorce @entity1 ’s legacy as a player from the decade or so of underachievement from what was a highly promising @entity5 group			1
‘ if we ca n’t make this one a player , we might as well give up , ’ sir @entity121 once said , viewing the young @entity122			0
looking back on @entity1 ’s international career , it would appear the @entity5 machine has failed even that simple challenge			1
it has taken one of the greatest @entity5 footballers of this , or any , generation , one of the most talented players in the world , the midfielder @entity129 says is the greatest he has played with , and somehow reduced him to mediocrity			1
tortured : @entity5 captain @entity1 looked injured mentally when he faced the press on sunday flattered to deceive : @entity140 is another player who fails to replicate club form for his country it is as if someone has pulled the plug on @entity146 , chucked a blanket over @entity148 , brought the curtain down on @entity150			1
this is one of the finest footballers we will ever see			2
and we ’re harking back to a golden hour against @entity70			1
@entity1 looked pained on sunday			1
injured , mentally more than physically			1
he picked at the back of his leg until he drew blood , and his face was wrinkled so intensely a bicycle could have been parked in one of the furrows on his brow			0
he recalled the afternoon after the night before , flicking around on his hotel television , back and forth , checking on @entity165 ’s game with @entity166 in the hope there might be one last lifeline			0
it was n’t to be			0
@entity1 gave the impression he half expected as much			1
‘ there was a small , tiny glimmer , but that made the pain even worse when the game was gone , ’ he said			0
‘ it was a desperate position to be in			0
' to me , that ’s not good enough , to be relying on others , when you ’ve got the talented players we have in this squad			0
' the margins are smaller now from where we were two years ago but , sitting here , we ’re bitterly disappointed			2
it ’s killing me not to have any positives to speak about			0
’ @entity189 to take time over retirement decision fighting back : @entity5 manager @entity112 ( right ) wants @entity1 ( left ) to remain as his captain dead rubber : @entity5 and @entity1 trained ahead of the @entity166 match on tuesday @entity5 are all about accentuating the positives in @entity196 , but it seems so empty in the wake of the poorest performance at a @entity30 since 1958			1
the margins are small , was yesterday ’s mantra			0
yet in three hours of football , @entity5 have not been ahead in a match , once			1
the group of death myth has also been exploded			0
no group of death is won by @entity166 , as seems likely here			0
@entity165 were not world - beaters			0
@entity209 truly are @entity129 plus 10 others			1
in @entity211 on tuesday , @entity5 will face a @entity166 team that would not merit a second glance from many @entity215 clubs - even , in @entity217 ’s case , the one that holds his registration , @entity220			1
it was hoped this game would be the comfortable victory that confirmed @entity225 progress , after tussles with @entity165 and @entity209			1
instead , it is a desperate attempt at saving face			0
@entity5 have never lost every match at a @entity30 , and a draw would merely confirm @entity166 ’s place as winners of @entity234 outcome would be a savage denouement for @entity112			1
and a win ? it would be scant consolation			0
this , then , is the proverbial kick into nothing			0
‘ the last couple of days have been grim , ’ @entity1 conceded			1
‘ it ’s a tough moment			0
in my head , i ’ve got a mixture of emotions : frustration , pain			0
dejected : too often have we seen the sight of @entity1 crouched in despair after an @entity5 match consoled : @entity1 ( left ) is hugged by @entity41 team - mate @entity129 ( right ) after the @entity209 defeat ' the season for @entity41 ended badly for me and the team			1
i was coming out of that , trying to put it to bed , trying to get some positivity back through the @entity30			0
this is exactly what i did n’t want to happen			0
‘ i have to try to grieve , get away with the family and away from international football , and then make a decision on my future			2
' it would be wrong for me to make that decision now			0
i will consider it long and hard , speak to people who will guide me			0
i ’ve put everyone before myself			0
i ’ve done that all the way through			0
this time i ’ve got to make the decision that is best for me			0
i ’ve told @entity112 i ’ll need three weeks to clear my head			0
‘ it ’s difficult to put into words			0
when you ’re an @entity5 player , the captain , a fan and you ’ve worked so hard to get into this position , for it to backfire over a few days , it ’s a tough place to be			2
i ’m not going to share blame or responsibility			0
i ’ve got to take it on the chin			0
’ when @entity5 ’s underachievement was put before @entity112 , the @entity5 manager had little in the ways of tangible answers			2
all alone : @entity112 's position has come under question following @entity5 's elimination in @entity196 endemic : @entity5 's problems run far deeper than anyone imagined they did before @entity196 2014 ‘ @entity166 were the team who were going to finish bottom of the group , ’ he said			1
‘ yet they ’ll win it and might end up winning all three games			2
but if you can become a good team , maybe you can survive without necessarily having world - class players			2
‘ look at their team			2
their players were n’t regarded as world - class before the tournament , and maybe not after it , but they ’ve had success together			0
maybe there is something for us to learn from that			0
’ it sounded like clutching at straws , the idea a new @entity5 can be formed , minus its marquee names and elite performers			2
is this really where we go from here , the acceptance that while we might fail to make an international footballer out of a truly exceptional player in @entity1 , we might succeed with an inferior model ? there is no logic in that , no reason			1
if the path from here involves alchemy , the problems are greater than we have imagined			1
deep down they all know it , too .			0

@entity1 has never been able to replicate his @entity41 displays for @entity5
he has had *countless* *memorable* games for @entity41 down the years
in his 113 international appearances , he has far fewer for @entity5
@entity70 away in 2007 arguably his finest performance in @entity5 shirt
@entity1 in the national team is less than the sum of his parts
he looked injured mentally on sunday following the @entity209 defeat
@entity5 's problems are far greater then any of us ever imagined before
