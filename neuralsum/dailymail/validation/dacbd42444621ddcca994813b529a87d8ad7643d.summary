no wonder @entity2 's renaissance man @entity0 turned up at @entity3 yesterday for the @entity4 with a broad smile on his face			1
yes , it had to hurt a little that he had glorious opportunities to win the last two events on the @entity11 and did n't close the deal in either instance			2
but this is a man who had fallen so far in @entity16 he had n't registered a top - three finish here in five years , let alone two in a row			1
now , after becoming the last man to earn a spot in this elite field and on the verge of earning his first invitation to the masters for three years , it is not surprising the 37 - year - old has no trouble dwelling on the positives			1
@entity2 star @entity0 is standing on the brink of a @entity32 invitation for the first time in three years ' i 'm fine about not winning because the first thing was to earn loads of world ranking points to get me back into the top 50 , ' argued @entity0 , who has moved from 83rd to 45th â€” his highest ranking since 2012			1
' i 'm happy on the course , happy off it , and i really think i can build on what i have achieved these past two weeks			2
there 's better golf ahead of me			2
' @entity0 has turned his professional life around after making what he describes as ' the hardest decision of my career '			1
three months ago he resigned his @entity49 membership and woke to headlines proclaiming he had spurned the chance to play in the @entity52 , since you have to be a member to make the team			2
' i understood the stories and if it had n't involved me , it 's what i would have thought , ' he said			2
' but i have n't given up on the @entity52			0
my dream is to play in several more but i just have n't figured out how to yet			0
' my energy has been focused on getting back in the top 50 because that 's where i will be of most use to @entity65			0
' 37 - year - old @entity0 secured a third - place finish at the @entity67 as he continues his renaissance @entity0 was such a @entity49 loyalist he served on any number of committees			1
' it was such a difficult decision to resign that i took a few months to tell my manager @entity73 because i felt i was betraying him and the @entity11 , ' said @entity0			1
' but i was running out of second chances			0
i was going back and forth across the @entity75 and it was clearly affecting my golf			0
' now i feel so relaxed knowing i do n't have to run myself ragged			0
i ca n't tell you the difference it is making			0
' becoming a father has also helped			0
golf author @entity82 highlighted long ago the positive effects the ' nappy factor ' can have on a top pro and @entity0 is another paid - up subscriber			1
' the great thing is i do n't take my work home with me any more , ' said @entity0 , who lives with wife @entity89 and infant son @entity90 in @entity91			1
' i used to hang around the golf course all day at home wasting time but now i 'm much more savvy			0
' the world 's top 50 players get invitations at the end of this month to the masters , so no prizes for guessing the next target for one of @entity65 's best ball strikers			0
ranked world no 3 in 2008 , it 's exciting to think where this second act might take him			0
@entity0 has scaled the world rankings from 83rd up to 45th , his highest placing since 2012			1

@entity0 is on the verge of returning to the @entity32 tour
@entity0 secured a third - placed finish at the @entity67
he has scaled the ranks from 83rd to 45th , his highest placing since 2012
