it may come as a surprise to some - particularly @entity3 and @entity4 - but @entity5 has revealed how sir @entity6 inspired him to try to be a gracious manager			1
the @entity9 boss said in a wide - ranging interview with the @entity11 that the legendary @entity13 manager showed him ' two faces ' during their first competitive meeting in 2004 - the first one of a steely rival and the second one of a sporting loser			2
@entity5 had just made his first impression on the @entity19 by knocking out @entity13 with unfancied @entity20			1
the @entity21 sprinted down the touchline at @entity23 in an unforgettable celebration of @entity20 's last - gasp goal that sealed qualification and a seismic shock			2
sir @entity6 and @entity5 formed a firm friendship despite being fierce rivals @entity6 's @entity13 were stunned by @entity5 's @entity20 in the @entity19 in 2004 @entity5 sprinted down the touchline in celebration at @entity20 's last - gasp goal that sealed qualification ' that was when i felt the two faces of such a big man , ' said @entity5			1
' the first face was the competitor , the man that tried everything to win			0
and after that i found the man with principles , with the respect for the opponent , with the fair play – i found these two faces in that period , and that was very important for me			0
' in my culture , the @entity21 and the @entity53 culture , we do n’t have that culture of the second face ; we are in football to win and when we do n’t there is not a second face most of the time			0
but when we beat @entity13 in the @entity19 i got that beautiful face of a manager which i try to have myself			1
' @entity5 has attracted controversy like no other manager in the modern game			0
his many spats with @entity3 have seen him form a bitter rivalry with the @entity70 boss , with @entity5 's accusation in 2005 that the @entity72 is like ' a voyeur ' perhaps being the moment their relationship hit an all - time low , from which it has never recovered			1
@entity5 claims to have learned respect from @entity6 , but he has had many spats with @entity3 he also had a frosty relationship with @entity4 when the pair were rival managers in @entity82 the 52 - year - old , who looks set to claim his third @entity85 title with @entity9 this season , also formed a spiteful relationship with @entity4 while the pair duelled for honours in @entity82			1
arguably @entity5 's lowest moment came in gouging the eye of @entity4 's assistant , @entity94 , in the closing stages of a @entity97 defeat for @entity98 against @entity99			2
after the match he referred to ' @entity101 - using the @entity82 slang for penis			0
a less surprising @entity5 revelation is that he has no close friends in @entity107 football			0
' some , we like each other and have some communication , but i can not say so close , ' he said .			0

@entity5 has spoken about his first meeting with sir @entity6
@entity5 's @entity20 beat @entity13 in the 2004 @entity19
the @entity21 says @entity6 's respect in defeat has *influenced* him
@entity5 : i have a *problem* , i am getting better and better
