by @entity0 , political reporter ' irrational political demands ' : the guidelines are reminiscent of the comedy yes minister civil servants are being encouraged to resist the demands of ministers , a leaked document has revealed			1
they have been accused of undermining democracy , after the official document setting out the job description of permanent secretaries was discovered			0
@entity13 , the cabinet office minister , is said to be angry at suggestions that civil servants could pick and choose when they backed ministers			1
their priority must be serving the government of the day , he said			0
the 2009 document , which was still in use in recent weeks , lists the qualities needed for the leading civil servants , who are the @entity24 ’s most powerful government officials			1
it said a permanent secretary must ‘ balance ministers ’ or high - level stakeholders ’ immediate needs or priorities with the long - term aims of their department , being shrewd about what needs to be sacrificed , at what costs and what the implications might be ’			0
but in a letter to cabinet colleagues , mr @entity13 said : ‘ as currently framed [ the document ] plainly does not conform with constitutional propriety			1
‘ the civil service aims not to serve the " long - term aims of the department " but the priorities of the government of the day			2
’ the document , which was circulated by mr @entity13 last week , has intensified a row with civil servants over whether ministers should have more of a say in the appointment of permanent secretaries			1
mr @entity13 intends to update the guidelines , which could lead to further tensions			2
according to their code of conduct , civil servants should ‘ serve the government , whatever its political persuasion … in a way which maintains political impartiality ’			1
but the guidelines , which conjure an image of sir @entity62 , the fictional permanent secretary in the sitcom yes minister , said top civil servants ‘ tolerate high levels of ambiguity and uncertainty and rapid change — and at times irrational political demands ’			1
anger : former @entity72 minister @entity71 ( pictured ) said the rules were ' actually beyond a joke ' it added they ‘ act as a “ pivot point ” in terms of knowing when to “ serve ” the political agenda and manage ministers ’ expectations , versus leading the department with a strong sense of mission ’			0
former @entity72 minister @entity71 told @entity86 : ‘ this is actually beyond a joke			0
@entity13 ( pictured ) has written a stern letter to @entity90 colleagues ' we ca n’t have a kind of permanent government of an unelected bureaucracy deciding that it has its own long - term priorities which may be different to those of ministers and elected government			0
‘ and i think this does go to some of the problems that we ’re seeing of a civil service which is sometimes resistance to change			0
’ but former head of the civil service , @entity105 , said the document was an accurate summary of the relationship between civil servants and politicians			1
‘ ministers have a political agenda which civil servants ca n’t get into , ’ he said			1
‘ although you ’re working very closely together , you ’ve got to keep a bit of difference between yourselves			0
' he added : ‘ there is nothing there that i would n’t have put down in black and white ... some of it could have been a bit more straightforwardly expressed but ... i think it does reflect the borders that permanent secretaries ca n’t cross			0
’ a @entity127 spokesman said : ‘ the constitutional position is clear that the civil service exists to serve the government of the day , while retaining the potential to serve a future government			2
‘ a document laying out the criteria for permanent secretary candidates from 2009 , which predates both this government and the leadership of the civil service , did not reflect that position and is therefore being refreshed			2
‘ permanent secretary appointments are made on merit following fair and open competition			0

guidelines were produced in 2009 and were still being used in recent weeks
they say civil servants have to tolerate ' irrational political demands '
but cabinet office minister @entity13 *reacted* angrily to the document
he said @entity153 officials should serve the government of the day
