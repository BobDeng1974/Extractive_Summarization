if your job involves working in the ‘ death industry ’ - be it as a funeral director or a mortician - how do you find like - minded people to talk to about what you do on a daily basis ? working in such professions can make smalltalk a bit of a conversation stopper , but one website has come up with the answer			1
named ‘ @entity14 ’ , the site helps people who work in the death industry meet others with similar ' interests ' - letting the conversation flow onto darker topics without the fear of scaring the other person off			1
dead weird ? a dating website for people in the ' death industry ' is now online ( screenshot shown )			1
created by @entity28 's @entity27 , it boasts more than 5,000 members			1
it is intended to be used by people in the death industry like funeral directors , anatomists , taxidermists and so on people looking for love sign up to the website and then chat with like - minded people to arrange going on a date - very similar to other dating sites already in existence			1

@entity47 ’s @entity46 app is designed to help you get the most out of life by improving your well - being and fitness			0
but could it also be used to predict when you ’ll die ? that ’s what a new app called deadline is claiming , saying the tech can be used to predict exactly when you ’ll kick the bucket			0
the morbid app uses a variety of data including your blood pressure , height and sleep pattern to come up with the prediction that is apparently accurate to the second			0
‘ you 're going to die			0
sorry , we all do eventually , ’ company @entity68 writes on their @entity69			0
however , according to @entity73 , the app ’s claims of being accurate are not entirely true , instead being just ‘ a genetic algorithm that forecasts your death ’			2
one of the key problems she found was that it was generally frowned upon to talk to ‘ normal ’ people about work if you ’re a crematorium technician , anatomist , taxidermist and so on			0
being a museum curator herself who deals with dead specimens all day , she said this made it difficult for her to hold conversations when out with friends a potential love interests			0
‘ i just wanted to be able to chat to someone who could really understand me , ’ she said			0
‘ i wanted more friends in the same profession , not just my co-workers , and perhaps even a partner to talk to in the wee small hours of the night			0
‘ when asked , “ how was your day ? ” i wanted to be able to say how it really was , safe in the knowledge that uttering sentences not usually uttered by " normal " people would n’t send someone packing			0
’ ms @entity27 said she already has more than 5,000 members , and there are also regular meet - ups around the world for local members to get to know one another			1
' i have great comments on there from members saying they ’re really pleased someone has started a site like this , ' ms @entity27 added to @entity118			2
' it is meant to be for those within the profession but there is a section for " researcher " or " student " because there may be people who want to get into the industry and want to talk to others about how to do so			2
' it ’s also so that people who hold events can find death professionals to speak at them , if that ’s what they ’re looking for			2
