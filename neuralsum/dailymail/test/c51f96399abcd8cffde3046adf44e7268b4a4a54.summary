since it was revealed that @entity1 – the co-pilot who purposefully crashed @entity2 , killing 150 people – had been treated for psychiatric illness , a debate has ensued over whether privacy laws regarding medical records should be less strict when it comes to professions that carry special responsibilities			1
it has been widely argued that @entity12 's privacy laws were to blame for the tragedy			1
the @entity15 , for example , ran an article with the headline : ' @entity19 obsession with privacy let killer pilot fly			2
' similarly , another article published in time said : ' @entity19 privacy laws let pilot ' hide ' his illness from employers			1
' while @entity30 , @entity19 lawmaker and the transport spokesman for the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , called for airlines to have mandatory access to pilots ' medical records , @entity27 , president of the @entity28 ( @entity29 ) , disagreed			1
co-pilot @entity1 , who purposefully crashed @entity2 , killing 150 people , had been treated for a psychiatric illness , it later emerged			1
the discovery sparked a debate over whether airlines should be given greater access to pilots ' medical records mr @entity27 believes that current laws are appropriate , since aviation doctors are already relieved of their duties of confidentiality if they think a pilot could put other people 's lives at risk			1
if @entity1 's doctor did not alert @entity54 , it must have been because @entity1 did not seem like a threat			1
there are two arguments for why @entity1 's doctor did the right thing by not disclosing @entity1 's depression to his employer			1
first , functional doctor - patient relationships depend on trust			0
if confidentiality between patients and doctors is breached , patients will no longer trust their doctors			0
and a lack of trust will lead ( at least some ) patients to hide some of their symptoms or refrain from seeking medical attention altogether for fear of bad consequences , such as stigmatisation and work - related penalties			2
more dangerous than a pilot with a mental illness – or any number of other professions that carry the responsibility of a great many lives – is that one with a mental illness who will not seek treatment because he does not trust his doctor			2
for these reasons , philosopher @entity86 goes even further			0
the passenger jet crashed in @entity89 , @entity90 while en route from @entity92 to @entity93			2
all 150 people on board were killed on impact he argues that confidentiality should be ' far closer to an absolute obligation that it has generally taken to be ' and that doctors should honour confidentiality even in cases where the patient might harm a third party			1
if patients come to doctors for help , doctors have a chance at avoiding a possible catastrophe			0
strict @entity19 privacy laws which prevented doctors treating @entity1 from telling his airline about his ' suicidal tendencies ' were introduced as a consequence of the @entity116			1
the @entity54 pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week 's @entity122 disaster			0
but @entity19 law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer , something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash			0
the findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in @entity12 on a patient 's right to privacy , with chancellor @entity136 proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law			1
draconian legislation was initially brought in after @entity139 to prevent a repeat of government spying during the @entity143 era and subsequently the @entity145 secret police in @entity12			0
this extends far beyond confidential medical data , however , to stringent protection of someone 's identity , meaning many @entity19 publications only referred to @entity1 as @entity152 , even after his death			1
further data protection laws traced back to 1907 , which enshrines the ' right to your own picture ' , also mean images can only be published with the individual 's consent			0
with respect to medical data , the criminal code means doctors are only allowed to breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent ' a particularly serious crime ' or a threat to someone 's life			2
they can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy , but up to five years in jail for withholding ' credible information about the planning or commission ' of serious acts like murder			0
despite the variation in sentences , doctors have tended to favour the individual 's privacy			0
many in @entity12 are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor - patient privilege			0
if patients lose trust in doctors and do not ask for help , nothing will be gained – patients will remain afflicted by their illnesses and people who might be put at risk by patients will remain at risk			0
in the days before the crash , @entity1 searched online both for medical treatments and for ways to commit suicide , which suggests he was undecided as to what to do			1
so another way of thinking about his scenario is that perhaps if he had trusted his doctor even more – and shared with him or her the way in which he was thinking of committing suicide – his doctor could have done more to help him and to protect the passengers of the aircraft he piloted			0
@entity1 's doctor also did the right thing by not revealing his depression to @entity54 because his depression was far from obviously related to his crime			2
@entity217 , the president of the @entity218 and an adviser to the @entity221 army , said that ' there is n't a link between depression and aggressive suicide '			0
@entity226 , psychologist and professor at @entity228 , likewise told @entity229 that , given the sheer weight of numbers involved , you are far less likely to be harmed by a person with depression than by a person without depression			0
' the chances of killing others are higher for non-depressed than for depressed people , ' he said			2
furthermore , given the lack of relationship between depression and the pilot 's crime , it was not obviously in the public 's interest to know about @entity1 's depression and morally questionable that his medical history of depression has been exposed so freely			1
in @entity12 , medical confidentiality is supposed to be valid after death			0
publicly disclosing @entity1 's ailment harms the public trust in doctor - patient confidentiality after death – and it may stigmatise people who are suffering from depression but who would never hurt anyone ( but themselves )			1
the avoidable deaths of 150 people is a calamity and it makes sense to have a public debate about how to prevent future similar events from happening			1
luckily , breaching confidentiality and endangering relationships between patients and doctors is not the only answer			0
along with the crucially important rule of having two people in the cockpit at all times ( which violates nobody 's privacy ) , one medical measure to avoid future catastrophes is to notify employers of stay - home orders from doctors for employees who have high - responsibility jobs without mentioning the cause of the incapacitation			1
@entity1 reportedly had a sick note for the day he flew but never told the airline			2
if they had been aware of the sick note things might have been different .			0

@entity1 crashed @entity293 into the @entity294 , killing himself as well as the other *149* people on board the flight
it has since emerged @entity1 had been treated for psychiatric illness
news has triggered a debate over whether airlines should have mandatory access to all pilots ' medical records , to try and prevent a similar tragedy
