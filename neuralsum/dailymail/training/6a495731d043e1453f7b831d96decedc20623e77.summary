@entity1 residents witnessed night transform into day after a meteor was seen blazing through the the sky			1
at 3:05am local time , several security cameras throughout the @entity6 city captured the incredible sight of the space rock lighting up the area			1
the flash lasted for several seconds , with locals expressing their shock at the eerie glow which engulfed parts of the capital			0
at 3:05am local time , several security cameras throughout the city captured the incredible sight of the space rock lighting up the area			1
this image was captured by a @entity22 - 2 rooftop security camera the @entity23 ( @entity24 ) said the event was caused by a meteoroid entering the @entity28 's atmosphere and was recorded at an altitude of 31 - 43 miles ( 50 – 70km )			1
a rooftop camera from surveillance company @entity31 showed the transformation , while another camera revealed lights as seen from the @entity35 in @entity1			0
it 's unknown whether this meteoroid survived its entry into @entity28 ’s atmosphere to leave debris on and become a meteorite			1
@entity24 claims the most likely scenario is that it burned in the atmosphere without causing any damage to surrounding buildings			2
every day , more than 40 tonnes of meteoroids hit our atmosphere			1
a space rock lights up the streets in @entity6			0
it 's unknown whether this meteoroid survived its entry into @entity28 ’s atmosphere to leave debris on and become a meteorite @entity1 witnessed night transform into day after a meteor was seen blazing over the @entity6 capital many are tiny specks of comet dust that crumble harmlessly in @entity28 's atmosphere , producing a slow drizzle of meteors in the night sky			1
an asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system			0
most are located between @entity66 and @entity67 in the @entity68			0
a comet is a rock covered in ice , methane and other compounds			0
their orbits take them much further out of the solar system			0
a meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up			1
this debris itself is known as a meteoroid			2
most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere			2
if any of this meteoroid makes it to @entity28 , it is called a meteorite			1
@entity93 , meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets			2
if the fireball is travelling slow enough , and makes it low enough , it is possible that it can survive to the ground as a meteorite			0
last year , an incredible animation for @entity104 was unveiled that lets you scroll and zoom around the world as meteorite impacts from recorded history unfold before your eyes			2
the map was created by data journalist @entity113 , and shows where asteroids have impacted over the last thousand years			0
scrolling around the world , you can see where some of the biggest hotspots are			0
and it also highlights how vulnerable our planet is to asteroids			0
@entity123 estimates that just one per cent of the millions of asteroids in our solar system have been found			0
but , although you can see recorded impacts on land in these animations , most asteroids that encounter @entity28 either explode in the atmosphere or land at sea			1
this means the vast majority are unrecorded and , as we do n't know the location of every asteroid in the solar system , we 're not sure when one will next hit			2
@entity24 claims the most likely scenario is that the meteoroid burned in the atmosphere without causing any damage to surrounding buildings			1

a meteor was seen *streaking* through the skies at 3:05 am local time
it was caused by a meteoroid recorded at an altitude of 31 - 43 miles
it 's unknown whether it survived its fiery entry into @entity28 ’s atmosphere
every day , more than 40 tonnes of meteoroids hit our atmosphere
