social services had investigated them years earlier , but the case was closed after it was decided that the boys ’ ‘ basic needs ’ were being met by the pair			1
both teenagers were allowed by the parents to attend school and college , yet their emaciated physical condition was not picked up			1
eventually an investigation was launched when one of the brothers spoke to a college tutor			1
the court was given details of the cruel and depressing daily routine imposed on the boys from 2004 until 2011 behind the doors of the family home in @entity29			0
@entity60 amounted to two inadequate meals a day			2

the boys would eat their meals apart from the adults , sitting on the living room or landing floor			0
when they were not at school or college they were shut in their bedroom , which had a tv with no aerial , an xbox with no controller or games and a broken dvd player			1
by contrast the parents had computer games , televisions and dvds , which they would use late into the night			0
years of abuse : the brothers were only allowed out of the house ( above ) to go to school or college and run errands for their keepers , and were n't trusted to be alone in the kitchen or the bathroom in case they ' stole ' food and hot water miss @entity70 said the boys estimated they often spent 23 hours a day in their bedroom			1
a rope was used to secure the door			0
‘ they entertained themselves by creating fantasy games and carried them out in whispers , ’ she said			0
they were banned from the kitchen or bathroom without supervision in case they took food or used hot water			0
only one hot shower was allowed a week			1
any swearing was punished by washing the boys ’ mouths out with soap and water			0
in 2011 they escaped to buy biscuits one morning and were punished when the wrappers were spotted			0
one boy had to stay in bed for four or five days and the other for a month			0
‘ in the bedroom they were expected to lie silently in bed like statues , ’ said miss @entity70			0
on a different occasion one boy spent an entire summer holiday confined to his bed			0
@entity26 , who was on benefits , married factory worker @entity18 in 2002			1
the court heard he was the only father figure the boys had and they referred to him as ‘ dad ’			0
@entity143 , defending @entity18 , said : ‘ it is not a case of sadistic brutality			1
‘ it is a case of strict parenting gone badly , dreadfully and seriously off - track			2
’ judge @entity149 said the boys ’ physical health and emotional well - being had been seriously damaged , but he hoped they would recover from their ‘ stolen childhood ’			2
the court heard they had both put on weight and ‘ improved immensely ’ since being rescued .			2
