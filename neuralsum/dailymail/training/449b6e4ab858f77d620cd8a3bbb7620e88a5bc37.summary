by @entity0 when he vented his frustration about holiday prices shooting up during the school half - term break , @entity1 struck a chord with other parents			1
his rant to 250 @entity10 friends quickly went viral as outraged parents shared his post about rip - off prices 143,000 times			2
now the issue may even be debated in @entity15 after more than 100,000 signed an online petition calling for the government to curb prices			2
mr @entity1 , 41 , who was inspired to speak out after trying to book a trip to @entity28 with his seven - year - old daughter @entity29 , said he was stunned by the response on social media			1
his initial post asked why parents should be penalised for doing the right thing and not taking their children away during term time			0
he then set up a @entity10 group , @entity38 , and one member posted a link to an online petition titled ‘ stop holiday companies charging extra in school holidays ’ which at the time had only about 3,000 signatures			2
' sick to death of being ripped off ' : mr @entity1 's @entity10 post was shared 143,000 time by people who agreed price rise : mr @entity1 noticed that the cost of a stay at @entity28 in @entity51 , pictured , went up by £ 300 during half - term week mr @entity1 , of @entity52 , @entity53 , said : ‘ it was exactly what i would ’ve started , so i thought i may as well help it along			1
’ the sales director started his post after trying to book a villa at @entity60 during half - term last october and finding that the price was £ 300 higher than for the week before			1
he wrote : ‘ share this post if you have also had enough			0
’ ‘ i think i ’ve touched a nerve with this one , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t see why i should be penalised for sticking to the rules			0
’ mother - of - two @entity67 , from @entity69 , set up the petition last march in protest at the £ 600 difference in the cost of taking her family away during school holidays			1
she thought the petition , which calls for a cap on price rises in the school holidays , was ‘ dead in the water ’ – until mr @entity1 ’s @entity10 post ignited interest in it			1
campaigns which reach 100,000 signatures on the government ’s e-petitions website can be given parliamentary time , although no decision has been taken yet			0
mr @entity1 acknowledged that the call for price regulation might not be successful but said that it was raising awareness and increasing the chance that travel firms would change their policies			1
new rules mean head teachers can grant pupils absence outside school holidays only in exceptional circumstances			0
the sales director from the @entity106 in @entity53 set up a @entity10 group called @entity38 for those who felt the same way as he does - it now has more than 12,000 members e-petition : @entity67 's online call for action against holiday price hikes has 140,000 signatures the @entity116 said that one solution would be to stagger school holiday dates , rather than having most pupils off at the same time			1
the @entity120 said academies and free schools already had the power to set different term dates , with council - run schools being given it from 2015			0
the @entity126 has warned this could result in travel firms extending the periods in which they charge higher prices			0
the @entity131 said the @entity133 holiday industry relied on profits from peak periods , while @entity28 said its prices were based on supply and demand .			2
