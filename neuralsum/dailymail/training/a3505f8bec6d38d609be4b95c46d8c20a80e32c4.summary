by @entity0 a hilarious blunder at a company producing @entity4 merchandise has seen @entity5 mistaken for @entity7 defender @entity6 on a set of @entity4 mugs			1
the @entity11 president is pictured wearing the @entity7 football top after a junior member of staff was tasked with finding royalty free images of the @entity7 squad			2
the head and shoulders photo printed on the mugs show @entity5 wearing the kit , with the caption ' @entity21 squad @entity19 ' beneath it			1
can the real @entity6 please stand up ? : @entity11 president @entity5 cuts a striking figure in his @entity7 top , left , but poses little actual similarity to @entity7 and @entity27 defender @entity6 , right @entity5 , pictured bottom left , features as an @entity7 left - back according to the set of coffee mugs squad player : @entity6 has not started either any of @entity7 's first two @entity4 matches @entity35 's @entity7 side crashed out of the @entity36 @entity4 in the group stages after losing their first two matches by a scoreline to 2 - 1 to both @entity40 and @entity41			1
it is the @entity7 ' earliest @entity4 exit since 1958 and , perhaps most humiliatingly , they still have to play @entity43 in a dead rubber match on tuesday			0
the merchandise company which made the error has now hastily turned to @entity48 - based expert clearance resellers @entity47 to try and shift the stock that could have easily appeared in an @entity51 episode			0
wholesale clearance managing director @entity52 said the company contacted him with the hope of off - loading the stock			0
mr @entity52 said he believed a junior member of staff at the @entity48 company responsible could be facing demotion after being trusted with the task of sourcing royalty free pictures of each @entity7 player to use on the mugs			1
he said : ' they passed this onto to their young , bright eyed and bushy tailed new apprentice			0
@entity68 and @entity69 look - a - likes - at @entity72 - @entity71 fanfest @entity7 and @entity27 defender @entity6 , pictured in action against @entity75 earlier this year			1
he has yet to feature in the tournament			0
post-mortem : @entity7 's early exit from the @entity4 has caused an inquest to begin as to why down time : @entity6 ( centre ) walks with coach @entity35 and his team - mates in @entity83 ' the designs were proofed and signed off by their boss , who had clearly had a heavy night with the lads playing poker and before he 'd had his first vat of coffee the following morning			2
' they immediately contacted us and 2,000 of the @entity7 items were dispatched to our warehouse			0
we eagerly unpacked them and , indeed it turned out that the @entity6 cup had @entity5 's head on instead of @entity6 '			2
