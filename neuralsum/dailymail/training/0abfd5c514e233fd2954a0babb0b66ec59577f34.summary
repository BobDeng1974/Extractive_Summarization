i hope that my case now encourages other people in similar circumstances to seek redress			0
' i feel i had a responsibility to the community i grew up in to pursue my claim and to now talk about it publicly			1
' my case establishes that the people of @entity16 were exposed to the dangers of asbestos over forty years ago and were largely unaware or unable to do anything to protect themselves and their children			1
