by @entity0 and @entity2 - parkinson published : 08:17 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 18:41 est , 21 march 2012 a planned rise in the price of petrol will go ahead as @entity6 refused to freeze or reduce the amount of tax motorists pay for fuel			1
despite pressure from hard - pressed motorists and businesses that rely on fuel , such as hauliers , there will be a 3.02p per litre hike in fuel duty from august			1
the move sparks fears that the country could see a repeat of fuel protests similar to those seen in september 2000 when petrol pumps ran dry during a series of rolling blockades on the country 's motorway networks			2
' that is why we took action in last year 's budget to cut fuel duty so it is 6p lower than our predecessors planned			1
' we have also scrapped the last @entity48 's fuel duty escalator of annual above inflation rises , regardless of the oil price - and are today confirming the fair fuel stabiliser			1
' above inflation rises will only return if the oil price falls below £ 45 on a sustained basis - currently equivalent to around 75 @entity54 dollars			1
' @entity56 president @entity55 said : ' at a time of record prices at the pumps the august increase in duty is a budget blow - out which will force drivers off the road and could bring a summer of discontent for many			1
' we have heard much about tax allowances but the increase in fuel duty makes no allowance for car - dependent , rural and disabled drivers			1
' only last week the prime minister told @entity54 students that @entity75 fuel prices would make them ‘ faint ’ , yet the government seems intent on inflicting more pain for no gain on drivers			1
' ironically such a hike in duty does n’t necessarily help @entity48 finances as people will cut spending at the pumps and in shops , and it could fuel inflation			2
' @entity88 , national spokesman for campaign group @entity89 , said : ' the government has turned its back on families and businesses all across the country - three - quarters of the electorate who want lower fuel prices			2
' it ignores the threat of rising global oil prices - even the @entity101 are trying to pull down the price of crude			2
and it ignores robust research we gave to the prime minister showing that cutting duty will create jobs , improve gdp and cost the @entity111 absolutely nothing			0
' the rise in the price of @entity116 oil is doing little to help motorists at the pumps a rise in petrol prices could spark fuel protests similar to those seen in september 2000 professor @entity123 , director of the @entity124 , said : ' the chancellor ’s decision to go ahead with the summer rise in fuel duty is as unsurprising as it will be disappointing to 34 million drivers , especially when the chancellor acknowledges there is likely to be a further spike in oil prices			1
' @entity6 said that taxes should be fair , simple , predictable and support work			0
motoring tax fails on at least three of these measures and it is time for a review of exactly what fuel duty is for and who it impacts most			1
' in a move aimed at appeasing hard - pressed drivers , the chancellor also said he would increase vehicle excise duty only by inflation and it would be frozen for hauliers			1
@entity151 passengers were hit by an increase in air passenger duty along with a rise that was deferred from 2011			2

travel organisation @entity163 said the @entity166 news was ' incredibly disappointing ' but added that the @entity168 airport announcement was ' encouraging '			0

of 16,647 @entity56 members polled , 4per cent said they would change jobs to reduce mileage while 3per cent would have to abandon their job because of unaffordable travel costs			2
skilled service and manual workers are most at risk , with 9per cent fearing for their employment as a result of the rise			0
@entity189 , the @entity187 and north west @entity188 are the regions where there is most concern about jobs , the survey showed			0
the cost of refilling a car has reached record levels with many people saying the cost of fuel has affected their lives the planned increase is likely push petrol prices up to around 145p a litre , with diesel rising to 150p			1
those polled were asked what would be the effect of such prices , with 63per cent saying they would cut back on car use , 18per cent would cut back on grocery shopping and 23per cent would abandon or delay the purchase of furniture , home improvements or luxury items			0
@entity56 president @entity55 said : ' pump prices that many people ca n't afford means lost high street spending , higher transport costs , rising inflation , lost tax from lower fuel sales , lost tax from businesses going bust , lost tax from workers losing their jobs and a bigger unemployment benefit bill			1
' a hike in fuel costs at the start of the holiday season will backfire as many people are already cutting back			0
' there were hopes that @entity6 would repeat his u-turn during the @entity239 budget in which he abandoned a planned rise in fuel duty in january driving groups had hoped for a repeat of the @entity244 in november when mr @entity6 pulled a u-turn and axed a planned hike this january			1
he also lowered the original duty rise to the 3.02p figure from 5p			1
over 90 per cent of businesses and motorists think the government should cut fuel duty in the @entity253 , according to a poll by @entity255			1

it comes as diesel and unleaded prices hover around all - time highs			0
on friday , average diesel prices have hit 145.45p a litre , with unleaded at 138.5p			0
at present , 57.95p is taken in fuel duty for every litre bought on diesel and unleaded			1
@entity270 adds another 20 per cent - around 24p at current prices			0
as the price of fuel in the @entity75 continues to grow there are fears that hauliers may look at repeating fuel protests seen in september 2000			2
much of the country 's motorway network was brought to a grinding halt as lorry drivers reduced their speeds to 5mph rolling blockades			0
that year the price of petrol was 76.9p a litre			2
top agenda : many households will be hoping for some respite at the forecourts according to the @entity293 ( @entity293 ) , even a cut of 2.5p per litre of petrol would boost the economy , creating 180,000 jobs in just five years			0
the @entity293 said that it is clear fuel duty has a very significant impact on business and consumer finances and even a modest reduction could support economic growth and give an important psychological boost to financially squeezed households			1
its calculations show that these benefits could be reaped without hurting the public purse			0
these thoughts are echoed by campaign groups who are heaping pressure on the chancellor to stop the planned hike			0
members of @entity89 , which is backed by the @entity124 and freight organisations , said that an even bolder cut , by 5p to a litre of fuel , would cost the exchequer around £ 1billion but would be offset by intangible benefits of increased confidence and would add a further 30,000 jobs			1
it also said that a 2.5p cut would boost gdp by 0.33 per cent			0
@entity88 , spokesman for @entity89 , said : ' it is very frustrating that so many politicians are talking about every tax – the mansion tax , personal thresholds , @entity270 , the 50p rate – and so few are talking about the one tax that is right at the top of the agenda for families and businesses			0
' he added that the planned hike in fuel taxes would be ' cruel and brutal ' and claimed the government was trying to ‘ duck the central point ’ by blaming price increases at the forecourt to volatile oil prices given the @entity111 takes almost 82p in tax on every pound spent on fuel			1
the campaign group has urged supporters to contact their mp by e-mail to put pressure on the @entity111 for a ' cut in fuel duty ' not just another freeze			1
@entity357 , @entity358 ’s marketing director , claimed not a rise in fuel duty could mean the end for many hauliers			1
he said : ' this level of taxation simply can not be maintained by the @entity75 ’s hauliers who have already implemented as many fuel - efficient practices as possible yet are still being financially squeezed to the point of no return			2
' ministers want economic growth , yet they ’re shackling the fleet industry through unsustainable taxation			0
this is forcing businesses to turn down work because the high cost of fuel means there is no profit to be made			0
' the influential @entity379 says that the chancellor has ' plenty of wiggle room ’ to ease the pain on motorist tomorrow its senior advisor , @entity385 , said it would be ' an open goal ' for @entity6 in tomorrow 's budget			0
the report predicts that the chancellor will have around £ 7billion to play with on wednesday thanks to lower than expected borrowing			0
many motorists will have their fingers crossed that @entity6 will deliver at least some respite for cash - strapped households and businesses .			0
