@entity0 has run into trouble for its ' blatantly sexualised ' cover of the new @entity4 comic			1
the comic will be in the shops in november and has two covers , one by @entity8 and the other by @entity10 who is best known for his erotic illustrations			1
the one by mr @entity10 features @entity4 as her alter - ego @entity4 – ' a woman with a mission ' who ' just wo n't abide … being a target ' – on all fours with her backside in the air and what looks like bodypaint rather than a costume			1
too rude for @entity4 ? the sexualised cover that is getting the critics up in arms the controversial @entity4 cover by @entity10 who is best known for his erotic illustrations the comic – launched at @entity30 in @entity31 last month – will be written by @entity32 and illustrated by @entity8 but it is the alternative cover that has stoked anger from critics			1
the character of @entity36 comic first appeared in @entity0 spotlight # 32 ( cover - dated february 1977 ) as a one - off but was so popular she featured in a 50 - episode series ( april 1978 - june 1983 ) before being killed off			1
in 2009 , she was reborn in a seven - part series by @entity39			0
the new series written by @entity32 will be the third iteration			2
@entity4 's origin and basic character were designed by @entity44 , while her visual appearance was created by freelancer @entity46			0
' if you 're wondering what the hell @entity4 , aka @entity4 is doing , i believe it 's what 's known in the animal kingdom as " presenting " , ' wrote science fiction site io9			0
' she looks like she 's wearing body - paint , and that 's a big no - no for an industry still trying to remember that women exist and may perhaps read comics and also do n't want to feel completely gross when they do so			0
as for the position she 's in … @entity61 … here 's a simple rule : if it 's inappropriate for a male character , it should also be inappropriate for a female character			0
' @entity67 , a comics expert who blogs at comicbookgrrrl , told @entity69 that ' women do love superhero comics , and we even love a bit of cheesecake here and there , but this cover and the lack of thinking behind it is a prime example of why people continue to think superhero comics are for horny men only			1
' the male version : @entity85 as @entity85			0
he could go anywhere a spider can she added : ' i think it 's a really disappointing decision by @entity0 editorial to choose this kind of artist for a variant cover on a female - lead comic			1
there 's a time and a place for @entity10 's style of work , but it 's in erotic comics rather than superhero comics , or at least he could be asked to reduce the sexualised lens for this very different audience			2
' pop culture site the @entity104 added that ' anyone familiar with pornography knows this pose … ripped straight from the fantasy medium ' , pointing out its similarity to one @entity10 had already drawn in an @entity112 erotic comic			1
' this is what we talk about when we ask comic publishers not to actively offend their paying ( or potentially paying ) customers , ' wrote the @entity104 's @entity118			0
' it 's important to note , @entity10 is known for erotic art , and there 's absolutely a place for that			2
but was he the best choice to promote this particular comic ? i would say unequivocally no. ' @entity0 has yet to respond , but mr @entity32 tweeted : ' i can promise you we have no intention of blatantly sexualising any of the characters in our story ' , and ' i do n't have any input at all on covers			1
you have my word that our story treats @entity135 with the utmost respect			0
' @entity137 , the creator of @entity85 , the @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and other comic - book heroes @entity0 is trying to attract a bigger female audience and this summer said that its new comic @entity143 would have the norse god as a goddess			2
' the new @entity143 continues @entity0 's proud tradition of strong female characters like @entity0 , storm , @entity150 and more , ' the publisher said at the time			0
' and this new @entity143 is n't a temporary female substitute – she 's now the one and only @entity143 , and she is worthy ! '			0

third version of @entity4 comic to be launched in november
alternate cover is drawn by @entity10 , best known for his erotic drawings
@entity67 , a comics expert , ' disappointed ' by @entity0 decision
