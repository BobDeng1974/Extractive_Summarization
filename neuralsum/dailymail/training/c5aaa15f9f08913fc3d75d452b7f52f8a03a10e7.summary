men 's singles draw women 's singles draw @entity2 was handed the chance of possible revenge for his @entity6 disappointment of last year when he was handed a potential @entity8 fourth round against @entity10 conqueror @entity9			1
the 27 year - old @entity13 , seeded sixth for the first @entity12 of the year , might also face a quarter - final against @entity15 , who beat him at the same stage in @entity17 twelve months ago and also gave him a 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 thrashing in 56 minutes at the @entity20 in november			1
however , @entity2 would not face world no 1 @entity22 until the final and his scheduled semi-final opponent is @entity25 , who has been struggling for form so far on his return to the tour			2
@entity2 on court at @entity30 on thursday as the @entity32 no 1 prepares for the @entity8 @entity2 ( right ) takes a break during practice as coach @entity35 ( left ) looks on @entity36 @entity9 is focused during a training session in @entity17 ahead of the @entity8 @entity15 hits a return during a practice session at @entity30 on thursday @entity40 : qualifier @entity42 : @entity43 / qualifier @entity44 : @entity45 @entity46 : @entity9 @entity47 : @entity15 @entity48 : @entity25 f : @entity22 @entity2 faces a qualifier in the opening round and his first seeded opponent is due to be @entity52 @entity45 before the likely meeting with world @entity54 , who beat him in straight sets last summer at the @entity57			1
@entity58 , the other guaranteed @entity32 representative in the men ’s draw , was placed against 31st seed @entity61 of @entity63			0
defending champion @entity64 could face @entity22 in a repeat of last year ’s semi-final			0
@entity67 was drawn against world no 67 @entity69 of @entity70 , best known for her excellent @entity6 record			1
overall it is not the worst draw for @entity2 , although there could have been easier potential fourth rounds than facing the hugely talented @entity36			2
when he played @entity15 last year he was still some way from peak physical fitness after his back operation , but he will be a different proposition this time around , should both players get that far			0
@entity58 plays a backhand during his three - set win against @entity84 at @entity85 on thursday @entity67 has her eye on the ball as she claims victory over @entity89 in @entity90 having played exhibition tennis so far this season – very impressively – he will not be disappointed to get a qualifier first up and a relatively comfortable looking second round to ease his way in			1
@entity22 , who starts as the strong favourite for the event , can also ease his way in but his quarter has more than its quota of towering power merchants in @entity101 , @entity84 and @entity102			0
the standout first round in either draw is twice champion @entity106 against @entity108 @entity107			0
the two played a controversial match here two years ago when @entity106 called a suspicious injury time out when she began to struggle against the @entity108 , who lost to @entity67 this week .			0

@entity2 has been drawn against a qualifier in the first round
@entity2 could face @entity9 in the fourth round and @entity15 in the quarter - finals
@entity58 takes on @entity61 in his first match in @entity17
@entity67 will play @entity36 world no 67 @entity69
