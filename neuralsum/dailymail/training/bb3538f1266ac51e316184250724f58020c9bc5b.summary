under the bonnet of the 42 - year - old car is a 4.2 - litre engine which developed 265bhp when the car went on sale			2
this gave it a 0 - 60mph time of 6.3 seconds and a top speed of 142mph			2
but while it is n’t quick by today ’s standards , the @entity4 retains its timeless beauty - albeit with a more patriotic paint job			0
@entity51 , who is selling the car , said : ' it is a very rare and unique @entity4 and has the same potential as one of @entity57 ’s @entity56 to be very a good investment			0
' now , being in @entity60 instead of the @entity61 , the car is finally getting closer to its final destination , the @entity63			0
' as an investment or for promotional use this car is now maybe even more interesting with the @entity67 coming up this summer			0
' @entity68 , the manager of the @entity69 , added : ' @entity70 said the @entity4 was the most beautiful car and it is the only car in the @entity73 ' there is a certain kudos with a film car so have a @entity78 e-type like this with its provenance is a good price			1
' the car looks like it would be a good buy , as long as you can live with the paint job			0
if you want to be patriotic , it is a great car for this weekend			0
