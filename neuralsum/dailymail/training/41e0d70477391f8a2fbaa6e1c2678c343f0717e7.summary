by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:35 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 10:17 est , 12 december 2012 @entity2 today accused @entity3 of being a bully who ‘ can dish it out but he ca n't take it ’ as insults were thrown in a @entity11 row over government plans to limit rises in benefits to 1 per cent a year			1
the prime minister accused the shadow chancellor of ‘ not being able to keep his mouth shut for 20 seconds ’ after a stream of heckles about the below - inflation cap on welfare handouts			1
mr @entity2 clashed with @entity23 , who said the real - terms cut in state benefits was a ‘ tax on strivers ’			1
@entity2 took aim at @entity3 ' heckling today , after the shadow chancellor 's gaffe at the despatch box last week during a debate on the @entity34 ( left ) and in a swipe at the @entity15 ’s membership of the infamous @entity39 at @entity40 , the @entity36 leader asked : ' have you wrecked a restaurant recently ? ’ last week chancellor @entity43 announced he was ending the link between inflation and benefits rises , and from next april most working age benefits would rise by only 1 per cent , not the 2.2 per cent as planned			1
the policy will save £ 3.7billion by 2016 - 17			0
but mr @entity43 ’s suggestion that it was necessary to curb handouts for the jobless who are ‘ still asleep , living a life on benefits ’ while others go to work was seized on by @entity36 who say six in 10 of those affected are in jobs			1
defending the policy at @entity15 ’s questions , mr @entity2 said : ‘ the fact is this , that welfare needs to be controlled and everyone who is on tax credits will be affected by these changes because we have to get on top of the welfare bill			1
’ mr @entity2 said a person working full - time on the minimum wage would see their income tax bill halved under the coalition government			2
' we are saying to working people you can earn another £ 3,000 before you even start paying income tax			0
this is the party for people who work , his is the party of unlimited welfare			0
' labour leader @entity23 mocked the pm for his membership of university dining group , the @entity39 , asking : ' have you wrecked a restaurant recently ? ' but mr @entity23 claimed more than 60 per cent of those affected by the one per cent cap are in work			2
he launched a deeply personal attack on the chancellor saying those affected by the benefit curb included low earners			2
' it 's the factory worker on the night shift , it 's the carer who looks after elderly people around the clock and it 's the cleaner who cleans the chancellor 's office while his curtains are still drawn and he 's still in bed			1
' the chancellor calls them scroungers , what does the prime minister call them ? ' the @entity36 leader accused mr @entity43 ‘ trying to play divide and rule ’			1
mr @entity23 added : ‘ he said his changes were all about people living a life on benefits ... but it turned out it just was n’t true – it was a tax on strivers ’ mr @entity23 accused chancellor @entity43 of targeting his benefits squeeze on the person who cleans his office while he is still in bed amid a barrage of heckling from the @entity36 frontbench , mr @entity2 turned his fire on mr @entity3 , who last week blamed his stammer for a blunder in the @entity11 about whether or not the deficit is falling			1
the @entity15 said : ‘ i 'm surprised the @entity43 is shouting again because we learnt last week , like bullies all over the world he can dish it out but he ca n't take it			2
he never learns , he never learns			0
’ but mr @entity23 responded : ‘ i ’ve heard everything when the boy from the @entity39 lectures people on bullying – absolutely extraordinary			2
have you wrecked a restaurant recently ? ’ the @entity39 has a reputation for wealthy students donning dinner suits to trash restaurants in @entity40			0
mr @entity3 , described as a serial ‘ heckler , barracker and sledger ’ , was knocked off his stride last week when the chancellor announced that the government ’s deficit was forecast to fall this year			0
in an apparent slip , he conceded that the national deficit was ‘ not rising ’ , provoking a wave of @entity156 cheers			0
indeed , mr @entity3 , who has spoken in the past about his lifelong battle with a stammer , appeared to speak the words clearly			0
but the following day he suggested his condition was to blame for his confusion , saying it sometimes ‘ got the better of him ’			0
‘ everybody knows with me that i have a stammer , ’ he said			0
‘ sometimes that stammer gets the better of me in the first minute or two when i speak , especially when i have got the prime minister , the chancellor and 300 conservative mps yelling at me at the top of their voices			1
