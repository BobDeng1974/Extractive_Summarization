by @entity0 every day for 21 years , @entity1 woke up behind bars while the world outside moved on without him			1
so when the 51 - year - old was granted clemency by president @entity6 , he decided to make up for what he had missed			1
after his release from a halfway house in @entity10 , @entity11 , he refused to be ' free and unhappy ' , so he got married , had a @entity12 , got his hair cut and went for his first swim in nearly two decades			1
free man : @entity1 walks away from a halfway house in @entity10 after serving 21 years in prison now he is on the ' other side of the wall ' he is planning on starting a consulting service to help prisoners stay out of trouble and help them apply for clemency			1
after his release , he told the @entity25 : ' i never accepted my life sentence			1
i never got institutionalized because i never let the system be my life			0
' mr @entity1 was 29 - years old when he got life in prison for possession of and conspiracy to distribute 99.62 grams of crack cocaine			1
when he was jailed in 1992 , sentencing laws were harsher because the substance was deemed to be dangerously addictive			2
he has been in custody ever since and and has been forced to watch his children grow into teenagers from the confines of his cell			0
' i watched the world change , i saw tv and everything			0
i just was n't a part of it , ' he said			0
it took him under a minute to say his goodbyes to guards at the correctional facility and walk through a rusty gate to where his fiance , mother - of - two @entity52 , 64 , was waiting			2
two days later the pair , who met on a @entity56 dating website , tied the knot after being engaged for a year in @entity58 , @entity11			1
he has moved into a small apartment with her and claims she won his heart because she accepted that ' life means life '			0
tying the knot : after his release , he married @entity52 , 64 , who he met on a dating website , and enjoyed their first dance during the reception in @entity58 , @entity11 the sentence will stay on his criminal record despite his release , but he claims the term handed to him by a @entity74 in 1993 was too harsh			1
he said : ' i would 've still been in prison today if i had not been granted executive clemency			1
i 'm not claiming innocence			0
' i was n't granted a pardon			0
i 'm just saying the punishment i received was n't warranted			0
' in his first five years , @entity6 has granted 40 out of 10,001 clemency and pardon petitions received			2
mr @entity1 's successful application came after severe mandatory minimums enacted in 1986 for crack offenders were reduced in 2010			2
testing the water : still wearing his ankle monitor , he also took his first swim in nearly two decades he did not know he was eligible to apply for clemency until 2005 , after someone mentioned it in passing			2
so , in a bid to be released , he turned himself into a model inmate by enrolling in education programmes and staying out of trouble			0
he was told his application was successful in december , after the president said there had been a ' disparity ' in his sentence			2
@entity6 shortened the terms of @entity1 and seven other men and women serving long prison terms for cocaine - related crimes			1
the president wrote : ' commuting the sentences of these eight @entity109 is an important step toward restoring fundamental ideals of justice and fairness.but it must not be the last			0
' yielding to changes in public perception , @entity116 and @entity6 in 2010 passed the @entity117 that changed that formula to treat one gram of crack cocaine like 18 grams of powder			1
@entity116 is now considering the @entity121 of 2014 that would make reduced sentencing available to those convicted before the 2010 law change			0
new look : mr @entity1 has his hair cut by barber @entity127 after walking free			0
