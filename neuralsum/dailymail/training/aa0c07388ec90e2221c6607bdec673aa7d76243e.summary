the @entity0 in the @entity1 of @entity2 is a @entity3 for experienced climbers , providing some of the longest , most beautifully ethereal and lethal climbing spots in the world			1
temperatures can drop to as low as minus seven degrees centigrade in the glacier - sliced valley and frozen waterfalls stretch from 100 to 1,000 feet for brave climbers to try and scale			1
this series of incredible photographs show experienced mountaineers @entity15 , 30 , and @entity17 , 30 , scaling a monstrous 300 foot frozen waterfall called the ' @entity19 '			1
keeping cool : one of the climbers gets a foot hold on the 300ft frozen slab of ice called ' @entity19 ' perspective : the frozen water structures make a dramatic climb for brave and experienced climbers the slippery nature of the natural ice structure means both men know that one foot wrong could mean the difference between life and death			1
adventure photographer @entity33 , from @entity34 , @entity35 , said : ' the conditions at @entity0 are always challenging , ice climbing is exposed , cold and often wet			1
' it can be very hard at times , there is suffering no doubt			0
' the team used basic climbing gear including ice axes , ice screws , head torches and harnesses and managed to complete their expedition safely reaching the summit			2
@entity33 used a @entity51 camera to take the stomach churning aerial shots of the climbers digging their toes and axes in along the way			2
do n't look down : both men know that one foot wrong could mean the difference between life and death where 's @entity63 ? the waterfalls in the @entity1 @entity2 region are so colossal that it can be hard to pick out climbers from afar the @entity0 , part of the @entity1 , consists of 60 square miles of raw wilderness bordering @entity70 to the east and north			1
the glacier carved valley contains several sites where steep water runoffs from its peaks produce some of the best waterfall ice climbs in @entity79			2
the @entity19 , which is approximately 300 feet tall , is widely considered to be the most challenging frozen waterfall to climb in @entity81			2
only the most experienced climbers are advised to attempt it			0
these structures form when snow accumulating above settles , then slowly melts and refreezes while dripping down the wall @entity33 says , ' the climbs are not there year round , only in the winter			0
they are formed by what is called a ' melt freeze cycle ' where snow accumulating above will settle , then slowly melt and refreeze while dripping down the wall			0
' that is how these giant ice climbs are formed			0
they are not all necessarily flowing waterfalls in summertime and some of these climbs never form and will go years without appearing			0
' a long way to the bottom : a birds eye view of the slab of ice as one of the climbers nears a summit bare necessities : the group used basic climbing gear including ice axes , ice screws , head torches and harnesses surely a cumbersome camera adds to a precious load ? ' it takes motivation , sometimes you just want to climb and leave the camera at home , switch off and just enjoy the day but i love photographing climbing , it is my strongest passion in life after climbing , ' says @entity33			1
' combining these two passions inspires me deeply and i love capturing the greatest moments of my life and telling stories of both the unique places and the climbers			0
' ice climbing can be a risky activity , with dangerous climbs often resulting in fatality			0
last month , @entity35 @entity137 , 29 , plummeted more than 300m to his death while climbing a glacier in @entity79			0
it is believed the mountaineer was using minimal climbing equipment when attempting to scale the @entity143 on @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity146			0
the man with the cam : self portrait of @entity150 who took the stomach churning snaps @entity15 digs in to the slippery wet surface while another climber watches from below vertical drop : ' it can be very hard at times , there is suffering no doubt ' says @entity33 , an adventurer photographer long lengths of rope are used to attach climbers			1
some expeditions in this area have led to fatalities			2
@entity0 offers adventurers 100 to 1,000 ft vertical climbs in conditions which can dip below seven degrees centigrade worth it : the views in the @entity1 are spectacular			1

climbers @entity15 , 30 , and @entity17 , 30 , are shown scaling colossal frozen ice structure in @entity2 region
dramatic pics were captured by adventure photographer @entity150 using a @entity177
one foot wrong can mean death and temperatures plummet to minus 7 degrees centigrade in @entity0
the area is *popular* with *adrenalin* *junkies* seeking to climb 1,000ft frozen walls , although fatalities are not *uncommon*
