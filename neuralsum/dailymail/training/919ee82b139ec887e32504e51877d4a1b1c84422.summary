at the time of his death in @entity20 around 1994 or 1995 , the mole , who was originally from @entity16 , had been working for the @entity21 after being tempted by a large amount of money			1
the existence of the mole and his close contact with @entity6 came to light in newly - released court documents			2
@entity30 from the meeting between the informant and bin @entity6 led to the @entity5 thwarting a terrorist attack on a @entity36 cruise liner and another on a masonic lodge in @entity38			1
according to @entity39 , the @entity5 recruited the mole in 1993 when he was the driver and close confidant of the ' blind sheik ' @entity43 - the mastermind behind the 1993 @entity45 attack			1
in early 1993 , after being tipped off by the @entity46 , the @entity5 found the @entity16 driver on a terrorism watch list			2
following the 1993 attack on the @entity45 - where explosives detonated in an underground parking garage killing six people - the @entity5 began to watch the @entity52 , who was living in @entity38 , but needed a way to get closer			1
after failed attempts to deport the driver , the @entity5 turned him into a source using @entity57 , a high - ranking agent and @entity59 speaker			2
@entity57 initally approached the @entity16 driver under the guise of a friend who could help reunite him with his family , according to the @entity39 report			0
soon the @entity5 had tapped the phones in the driver 's home and were working on his wife to have her cooperate			0
the mole provided authentic @entity13 and @entity83 passports where the pictures had been cut out and replaced with @entity8 members , allowing them to travel freely			0
the @entity5 informant was also able to arrange a meeting in 1993 with a shadowy , little - known terrorist called @entity6			1
according to @entity39 , the mole told the @entity5 that the blind sheikh said : ' if you need any money , you go to @entity6 directly and tell him i sent you			1
' the informant 's crucial information sparked the interest of the @entity21 who convinced the @entity16 driver to come work with them for financial reward			0
around 1994 , the mole was sent to @entity20 to gain information on @entity8 operatives who were supporting @entity20 's @entity106 majority against the @entity107			1
leader : the source was close with ' blind @entity52 ' @entity43 , the @entity8 official who was behind the 1993 bombing of the @entity45 his handler @entity57 had no idea what had happened to the driver			0
later , the @entity5 agent , who had gone undercover among terrorists cells in @entity38 , found out that @entity8 had killed the driver because they believed him to be a @entity21 mole			1
the previously - unknown meeting between an @entity5 mole and @entity6 came to light when @entity57 filed a discrimination lawsuit against the agency			1
the @entity124 reported that former @entity5 official @entity125 testified on @entity57 's behalf in the 2010 case and told of the agent 's successes at the bureau			0
news of the @entity5 's source meeting with @entity6 comes in direct contrast to previous testimony that was used as the ' accepted ' timeline of events leading up to the 9/11 attacks			2
the @entity138 described the @entity5 's intelligence on @entity6 at the time as being ' at best cloudy ' and made no mention of a source who had direct contact with the terrorist			2
the former head of the @entity147 argues that the source was not directly related to the plot against the @entity45 as his information came six years earlier			0
@entity57 filed a discrimination suit against the bureau saying that he was sidelined after september 11 because his colleagues assumed he was an @entity106			0
the highly - decorated agent is a @entity154			0
@entity57 continues to work for the @entity5 while pursuing his discrimination case .			0
