by @entity0 published : 19:15 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 17 october 2013 @entity1 : former minister @entity2 was accused of having called police officers ' plebs ' while leaving @entity5 on his bike a police force has been accused of an extraordinary 11th - hour cover - up over claims three senior officers lied to blacken the name of former cabinet minister @entity2			1
in an explosive letter , watchdog @entity12 said an internal investigation by @entity16 was altered at the last minute to clear them of misconduct			1
on tuesday , the @entity19 suggested officers lied about what mr @entity2 said in a private meeting about the ‘ @entity1 ’ row			1
it said they wanted to heap pressure on him to resign over disputed claims he called @entity5 police officers ‘ plebs ’ during an argument at the @entity32			2
and it concluded that the trio – inspector @entity36 , detective sergeant @entity37 and sergeant @entity38 – should have faced misconduct hearings			0
@entity19 deputy chairman @entity40 last night revealed that the first draft of an earlier @entity16 inquiry drew the same conclusion			2
but within a month , the force changed its mind			2
in a letter copied to the home secretary , miss @entity12 said : ‘ we had no concerns about the quality of the investigation carried out by @entity16			1
it was the conclusion we disagreed with			0
‘ in that regard , i note that in the first draft report submitted to the @entity19 in july the senior investigating officer did in fact conclude there was a case to answer for misconduct			2
although the final report in august , did not			0
’ it is not clear who ordered the report to be changed or why			0
@entity16 declined to comment last night			2
but one senior @entity63 said its chief constable @entity64 would have to ‘ consider his position ’ if it emerged he had been involved in the decision			0
the prime minister told @entity69 yesterday that the conduct of the officers , who were representing the @entity72 , was ‘ not acceptable ’ and backed calls for mr @entity64 to apologise to mr @entity2			1
mr @entity74 said it was only thanks to a recording of the meeting by mr @entity2 that he was able to show that ‘ what the police officers said was untrue			1
’ inspector @entity36 is from the @entity16 force , @entity80 is from @entity83 and @entity84 is from @entity85			1
force of the force : @entity12 , deputy chair of @entity16 watchdog the @entity19 , said an internal investigation by @entity16 was altered at the last minute mr @entity64 , along with the chief constables of the @entity83 and @entity85 forces , will be grilled by mps over the issue next week			1
@entity63 mp @entity92 said all three might have to resign if they were found to have been involved in a cover - up			1
he said : ‘ [ mr @entity64 ] has to explain exactly what has happened			0
if it is apparent that he has been part of the change in the [ report ’s ] conclusions then frankly i think he has got to consider his position			0
if [ the other chief constables ] were part of it as well then they are in the same position			0
’ the investigation by @entity16 concluded there were no grounds for a misconduct inquiry as there was ‘ no deliberate intention to lie ’			1
but miss @entity12 branded the investigation a whitewash , and warned the incident raised questions about the ‘ honesty and integrity ’ of the three officers involved			2
her intervention drew an angry response from the @entity72 and the three forces			0
@entity83 police and crime commissioner @entity124 yesterday said her comments had been ‘ completely unjustified ’ and ‘ very inappropriate ’ , and called for the abolition of the @entity19			0
the former shadow home secretary @entity127 said : ‘ what the @entity19 did here was trust the police , as the public do generally , and unfortunately what this demonstrates is that the police can not be trusted , actually , to investigate themselves			0
‘ i ’m afraid it is as plain as a pikestaff that what is happening here is the senior officers are trying to prevent their own forces from embarrassment ... an attempt to stop embarrassment i ’m afraid is a disgrace			1
’ the @entity145 is now considering whether to bring criminal charges following a long - running police investigation into the original ‘ @entity1 ’ incident in september last year			1
mr @entity2 admits losing his temper and swearing after police stopped him riding his bicycle through the gates of @entity5			2
but he has always denied using the word ‘ plebs ’ , as claimed in a ‘ police log ’ which was leaked to the media			0
eight people , including five police officers from the @entity159 , were arrested .			0
