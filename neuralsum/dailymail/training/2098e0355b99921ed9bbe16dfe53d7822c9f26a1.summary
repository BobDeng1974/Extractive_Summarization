@entity1 's ' three breasts ' have gotten their 15 minutes of fame , but they 've finally been exposed as a sham after all			2
@entity6 station @entity4 has now outed @entity8 third breast as fake after obtaining a luggage theft report filed earlier this month by the 21 - year - old at @entity12			1
in the report , @entity1 ( going by her real name @entity14 ) lists the contents of a bag which was stolen off the @entity19 conveyor belt , including a $ 5,000 ' 3 breast prosthesis ' inside			1
cops eventually tracked down the thieves using surveillance footage , and returned @entity14 's black nylon bag - but not before taking an official inventory			1

neighbors said they hardly saw @entity14			2
' she keeps very odd hours , ' said one neighbor			0
' you 'd see her coming in at 6am when i 'd be leaving to drive to work			0
she seemed nice enough but i do n't believe her getting another breast			0
i just saw it on the news and it 's fake			0
she just wants to make a name for herself			0
' other facts of @entity1 's story also do n't line up , like fact that she shied away from showing her breast when interview by a @entity179 reporter this week			2
' i do n't feel comfortable doing that just yet , ' @entity1 said			2
' [ because ] that 's also going to be on my show where i 'm actually walking out on the beach with this top on and i want to save that			0
' the only other pictures of her third - breast are self - produced , and no other third - party pictures have emerged ... other than the @entity179 footage			0
in one @entity91 clip , @entity1 's third breast appears to be a different skin color than her other limbs			2
surgeons are also barred from performing procedures on patients with mental health issues , and @entity1 made it known that she ' added the third breast in order to become unattractive to men			2
while the procedure is possible , surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to ' human dignity '			0

she says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements			0
the massage therapist , who recently celebrated her 21st birthday , has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her @entity247 fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate			0
despite scheduling interviews , creating a fan page , and hiring a film crew , @entity1 insists her apparent surgery was not an attempt become famous			0
' i got it because i wanted to make myself unattractive to men , ' she claims			0
' because i do n't want to date anymore			0
' @entity139 's calls to @entity14 were not answered tuesday morning			0
unethical : while the operation to add a third - breast is physical feasible , experts say that no surgeon would agree to carry out such a procedure on someone who may not be mentally well			0

the woman calling herself @entity1 lost a bag at @entity12 earlier this month
once the bag was found , an inventory was taken , and a $ 5,000 ' 3 breast prosthesis ' listed as one of the contents
@entity1 has also been connected to a @entity12 masseuse named @entity14 - who owns the domain name @entity46
the two women look strikingly similar
@entity14 *previously* made national news last year , when she ordered an alleged attacker stand on a corner holding an ' i beat women ' poster
