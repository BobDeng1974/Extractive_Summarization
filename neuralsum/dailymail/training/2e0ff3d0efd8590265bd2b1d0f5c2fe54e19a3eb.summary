earlier this year , during the @entity3 tour , a wisp of doubt crept in			2
then there was a growing suspicion when they trotted through @entity6 in baseball caps , before the awful truth emerged on their whistle - stop tour to @entity11 this week			2
which is that however you look at it , be you republican or royalist , the @entity13 and @entity14 have become a terrible , terrible disappointment to us all			2
i ’m sorry , but they have			2
nearly four years after they married at @entity23 , in a fairytale ceremony that was gasping in its gorgeousness , the gilt is off the gingerbread , the bloom has gone from the rose			1
they are @entity52 , not high class			1
there is n’t an occasion they ca n’t live down to and they almost always fail to exhibit the sense of grandeur and dignity that the monarchy demands			1
quite frankly , they are a bit of a bore			2
in the beginning , hopes were high for the launch of the new @entity40 ; two potentially alluring and exciting members of a fascinating family , one whose history is stitched through the tapestry of @entity73 life like a shimmering , golden thread			1
they would be our new symbols of modern @entity73 , they would single - handedly invigorate the @entity50 , they would go out in the world as shining representatives of our country			2
we would be proud of them , as they were proud of us			2
but that is not what has happened			2
but even at black - tie galas , including at the @entity89 600th @entity88 in @entity11 this week , @entity14 and @entity90 somehow manage to look as if they are attending a golf club dinner in the @entity93 while in the @entity95 , the pair turned up at their hotel like any old pair of out - of - towners , to be met by the schmoozing manager and a barrage of paparazzi instead , what we got are a couple of dreary suburbanites , a @entity105 and mrs @entity106 who trundle around the world in mumsy dresses and dad - trousers , saying not very much at all			1
so terrified are the low - impact @entity33 of causing even a hint of controversy , they make a point of never uttering anything within ten miles of that town called mildly interesting			2
this fear of disputation , matched with a craving for the public approval that ensures their survival , has turned them into a pair of weird , international geisha - people			1
mouthing only platitudes , they smile and nod at everything as they cut ribbons and accept posies like royal robots			1
they have none of the beguilement that strange , little @entity144 @entity143 aroused , none of the deep respect the current queen commands , not a drop of the molten glamour that @entity141 , @entity142 oozed			2
even at black - tie galas in palaces or embassies , @entity14 and @entity90 somehow manage to look as if they are attending a golf club dinner in the @entity93 , just after they have finished the weekend shop at @entity152			2
in speeches and in the spotlight , they come across as a couple from @entity157 who just can not believe their luck			2
@entity41 , pictured sharing popcorn while watching the @entity161 against the @entity162 in @entity11 , make a point of never uttering anything within ten miles of that town called mildly interesting instead , the couple dazzled the @entity167 like a pair of damp squibs submerged in a bucket of cringe when the @entity33 met @entity172 and @entity173 at the basketball match , it was clear to see who was the most regal and important — and it was n’t the duke and duchess look at their trip to @entity11 this week			1
what was that all about ? from @entity183 to the @entity184 , they dazzled the @entity167 like a pair of damp squibs submerged in a bucket of cringe			1
@entity14 wore 50 shades of gloom while @entity90 fussed with his blazer buttons and made appeals on behalf of the very important cause to which he is devoted ; saving elephants and stopping the ivory trade			0
it might be very noble of him , but i do wish he would instead highlight causes that really mean something to @entity73 people , things that affect their daily lives			0
and it does seem rather hypocritical to try to save one species of animal , while the royals gaily blast game birds and stags at every opportunity			1
meanwhile , back in @entity209 , i winced when they turned up at their hotel like any old pair of out - of - towners , to be met by the schmoozing manager and a barrage of paparazzi			1
they smile and nod as they cut ribbons and accept posies like royal robots			1
pictured : @entity14 chats with members from the arts and business community before lunch at the residence of the @entity73 consul general the pair have been trundling around @entity167 on their tour in mumsy dresses and dad - trousers , saying not very much at all			1
pictured : @entity14 speaking to @entity234 at the creativity is great event on tuesday later , they were photographed under an umbrella prominently displaying the name of the hotel ; a lovely bit of global advertising right there , thank you very much			0
can you imagine the queen ever allowing herself to be duped into such a tacky situation ? no , me neither			0
the @entity33 were introduced to pop royalty @entity172 and @entity173 at a basketball match , where it was clear to see who was the most regal and important — and it was n’t the duke and duchess			1
other vips they met included film mogul @entity257 , editrix @entity258 and former reality show star @entity260 , a list that tells you everything you need to know about the trip			1
the main reason for going to @entity11 in the first place was to raise money for @entity89 , the @entity269 university where @entity14 and @entity90 met and studied			1
does this privileged university really qualify as a noble cause ? and what has it even got to do with @entity167 , especially those very rich ones who disparagingly call royal fund - raising trips like this ‘ @entity278 raids ’ the @entity33 visited many different sites around the @entity95 , including @entity280 they both have excellent qualities - but there is no pizazz , no drama , no sprinkling of magic dust about them royalty needs a bit of mystique to keep interest piqued - it needs star power			1
pictured : the pair visit the @entity295 and museum during their visit to @entity11 the @entity33 trotted around the @entity95 , marble begging bowls at the ready , in a thoroughly demeaning way			1
is n’t it all rather embarrassing , particularly when one considers how rich @entity90 is ? the duke roused himself to make a typically dull , three - paragraph ‘ speech ’ at a wildlife reception , which he ended with : ‘ i ’m off to shoot some hoops now , or whatever it is you @entity167 say			1
’ that ’s about as funny as a tusk - poaching expedition			0
it is not that they are not nice people ; they clearly are			0
indeed , they have many excellent qualities			0
he is built of solid @entity50 timber , a prince we can rely on always to do the right thing			0
she makes an absolutely tremendous duchess , in every way			0
she is polite and charming , and always looks thrilled to be meeting whoever it is she is meeting			0
that is a very big plus			0
however , the problem is that there is no pizazz , no drama , no sprinkling of magic dust about them			0
the only exciting , spontaneous thing that happened this year was when @entity339 threw away his stuffed bilby toy at @entity341 during the @entity3 tour			0
there is increasingly a very fine and indeterminable line between royalty and celebrity - and the @entity33 , pictured here in @entity3 earlier this year , may have crossed it there were those moments when @entity14 insisted on wearing the kind of ill - advised gossamer skirts that float upwards when a cricket coughs , but they are becoming rarer the only exciting , spontaneous thing that happened this year was when @entity339 threw away his stuffed bilby toy at @entity341 during the @entity3 tour ( pictured ) yes , there were those moments when @entity14 insisted on wearing the kind of ill - advised gossamer skirts that float upwards when a cricket coughs , but they are becoming rarer			1
she and @entity90 even allowed themselves to be mocked and joked about by a bunch of third - rate comics on the @entity359 , which was screened this week			0
the pair even allowed themselves to be mocked and joked by a bunch of third - rate comics on the @entity359 ( pictured ) in a break from the usual protocol , the @entity364 at the @entity365 was bathed in lights , and cameras captured their reactions throughout the evening			1
host @entity371 even introduced them , as if they were just another act appearing between the ‘ utterly sensational @entity375 ’ and the legendary @entity376			0
‘ making their debut tonight , the @entity13 and @entity14 , how exciting , thank you for coming , ’ roared @entity377 , as the couple grinned like goons			0
he also congratulated them on having an addition to the family and asked : ‘ who ’s the daddy ? ’ comedian @entity388 made much of the fact that he attended the same school as @entity14			0
‘ i do n’t know if it is appropriate , but you were my first ever crush , ’ he told her , adding that his ‘ posh ’ mother is ‘ absolutely obsessed with you ’			0
i do hope our own dear @entity144 was n’t watching			0
there is increasingly a very fine and indeterminable line between royalty and celebrity			1
and as they capered around @entity11 and giggled at the @entity359 , it seemed that the @entity33 have crossed it			1
i blame prince @entity90 and his insistence on an approach that is as informal as protocol will allow			0
he wants to get down with the kids , to be seen as just another bloke			0
yet i wonder if he has not made a terrible mistake			0
royalty needs a bit of mystique to keep interest piqued			1
the days of the @entity416 being able to stand apart from society , to be remote but still respected by their adoring subjects , have gone			0
yet if our future @entity421 want to be a relevant force in the future , they have to realise that they ca n’t just be one of the boys and girls			0
they really will have to do better than this .			0

after their fairytale wedding , hopes were high for the new @entity40
but they fail to exhibit the grandeur and dignity the monarchy demands
they smile and nod as they cut ribbons and accept posies like royal robot
and they dazzled the @entity167 like damp squibs submerged in bucket of cringe
they were even *outshone* by @entity172 and @entity173 when they met at a game
the pair appear to have crossed the fine line between royalty and celebrity
