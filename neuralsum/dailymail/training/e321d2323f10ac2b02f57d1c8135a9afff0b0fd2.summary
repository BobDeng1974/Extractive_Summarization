by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:55 am on 22nd june 2011 one of the advantages of ageing is the right to do things your own way			2
and having reached 90 , it seems the @entity8 is keen to exercise this privilege as much as possible			1
arriving for a rare private lunch at @entity11 yesterday , prince @entity8 stood to one side as his wife efficiently stepped into position for an official photocall with the prime minister and his wife			1
@entity18 gently attempted to guide the @entity8 to his place in between her and the @entity20 , as the media advisers and spinmasters had wanted			1
in the line of duty : @entity18 politely encourages the @entity8 to take his spot in between her and the queen age before beauty : but independent @entity8 has other ideas carry on regardless : the prime minister looks bemused but independent @entity8 was having none of it and instead walked to the end of the line , on mrs @entity18 's right			1
reluctant to be the one to dissuade him , mrs @entity18 simply smiled for the cameras – as a slightly bemused mr @entity40 looked on			0
the four then made their way to the @entity43 to celebrate the @entity8 's recent birthday with @entity45 and watercress tart , followed by @entity48 beef from @entity49 and rounded off with peaches , nectarines and ice cream			1
the @entity20 was said to have found the prime minister and his wife ‘ delightful '			1
how lovely to see you ! as the royal car arrived two men on the roof of @entity61 wearing hard hats and high visibility jackets raised the @entity62 welcome , your majesty : mr @entity40 bows to the @entity20			2
it is understood the last time the royal couple visited @entity11 was in april 2002 for an event hosted by @entity67 and @entity68 past premiers : the queen and mr @entity40 in conversation as they walk down the staircase in @entity11 which is adorned with pictures of previous prime ministers private party : the @entity78 and the royal couple had tucked into a starter of @entity45 and watercress tart , followed by @entity48 beef from @entity49 and a dessert of peaches and nectarines with ice cream taking her leave : the @entity20 looked radiant in a green jacket and white gloves as she left @entity90 and headed home thanks for coming : the @entity78 wave as the @entity20 and prince @entity8 leave @entity11 and head back to @entity92 the royal couple arrived in their @entity94 just after 1pm and as the car drove up the street two men on the roof of @entity61 wearing hard hats and high visibility jackets raised the @entity62			1
mrs @entity18 curtseyed as she shook hands , first with the @entity20 and then with the @entity8			1
the @entity20 was wearing a green jacket over a floral dress and white gloves and mrs @entity18 was in a patterned white dress with green belt			2
the @entity108 , the right reverend @entity109 , introduces the queen to members of the congregation after the 300th anniversary service at the cathedral the royal couple leave @entity116 's before heading off to @entity11 for lunch with the @entity78 in good voice : the @entity20 led the nation in honouring @entity120 , which came to symbolise @entity123 's @entity122 defiance during the @entity124 a 15 - year project completed this month is the first time the cathedral has been comprehensively restored inside and out			1
it is the fourth building on the site and was designed by architect sir @entity130 and built between 1675 and 1710 after its predecessor was destroyed in the @entity133			0
june 21 is a significant date for the cathedral as it marks the same day the first stone is believed to have been laid in 1675			0
despite the work finishing in 1710 , @entity130 was handed his final payment on christmas day 1711 and when he died he was buried in the cathedral in a plain grave			0
it is marked with a @entity144 inscription written by his son that said : ' if you seek his monument , look around you '			0
over the centuries the cathedral has adapted to meet changing styles and needs with decorations being added and removed			0
the impressive mosaics that cover the walls were the result of a complaint by @entity158 who had described the interior as ' most dreary , dingy and undevotional '			0
the cathedral 's famous dome is actually three in one - an outer ' skin ' , an ornately decorated inner structure seen by congregations and a brick cone between the two that supports the lantern on top of the building			2
the restoration scheme has seen the once blackened and damaged west front returned to its former glory			0
other work included cleaning and repair of the interior , redesign and landscaping of the south churchyard gardens , restoration of the grand organ and adding wheelchair access to the crypt			0
after pausing for a brief moment for photos mr @entity40 led the group into @entity90 where they tucked into a starter of @entity45 and watercress tart , followed by @entity48 beef from @entity49 , and a dessert of peaches and nectarines with ice cream			0
it is understood that the last time the royal couple visited @entity11 was in april 2002 for an event hosted by @entity67 and @entity68			1
earlier this month , before the @entity8 became a nonagenarian on june 10 , mr @entity40 spoke of the country 's gratitude for his work			1
the prime minister described him as a ' remarkable man who has given years of his service to our country , someone who has defended his nation in time of war , a man who has stood alongside @entity20 for over six decades , a man who has given his time and effort and passion to so many great causes up and down the country , across the @entity216 and indeed the world '			1
the @entity20 and the @entity8 left @entity11 shortly before 2.30pm			1
mr @entity40 stood with his arm around his wife 's waist as they waved goodbye			2
earlier in the day the royal couple attended a service at @entity120 to mark its 300th anniversary			1
sir @entity130 's masterpiece came to symbolise @entity123 's defiance during the blitz and has played an important role in the spiritual life of the nation over the centuries			2
it was the setting for the marriage of the @entity235 and @entity236 and for the funerals of sir @entity238 , @entity239 and the @entity240			0
it staged jubilee celebrations for @entity158 , peace services marking the end of the @entity245 and another commemorating the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001			0
its @entity247 , the right reverend @entity109 , gave the sermon at the service , before a congregation including cathedral staff , volunteers and guides			2
he said : ' what better monument could a man leave behind him , other than a cathedral , which has come to represent the presence of @entity260 at the heart of this amazing city ? ' the much overworked word " iconic " has been used to describe the dome , and no one can fail to recognise its silhouette			0
' the wartime photograph of the dome rising unscathed above the smoke and fire of the @entity124 can be found anywhere			0
' he added : ' but you will be surprised to hear , the one question visitors ask when they come through our door remains " so , do you still hold services here ? " the question is usually asked incredulously			0
' earlier this month a £ 40 million project to clean and repair @entity116 's was completed after 15 years .			2

it is the first visit by the @entity20 and prince @entity8 since april 2002
before lunch they went to a service to celebrate @entity120 's 300th anniversary
