by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:29 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 07:24 est , 10 december 2012 chancellor @entity2 , who was out jogging in @entity3 today , has defended the rise 1 per cent rise in benefits , saying welfare handouts had risen at twice the rate of wages @entity10 are to hold talks on voting against a cap on welfare rises , branding them a ‘ horrible thing to do ’			1
backbench mps claim they are ‘ distressed ’ that leader @entity16 signed up a below - inflation 1 per cent rise in benefits in each of the next three years			1
the @entity20 is also suggesting it will try to block the move , which chancellor @entity2 said was needed after benefits rose at twice the rate of average wages			1
the @entity25 hopes to save £ 4.4billion a year through the cap on working - age benefits announced last week by chancellor @entity2			1
@entity29 sources say the amount is equal to 1p a year on basic income tax			2
but some @entity32 are considering voting against the measure , and plan to voice their opposition this week			1
@entity36 mp @entity35 attacked @entity37 who sound ' pleased ' about cutting benefits			1
' i mean they seem to be hitting some of the most vulnerable people in this country			2
' the remaining real - terms cut in benefits is a very painful thing to swallow and it 's a difficult thing for us to swallow politically but much more difficult for people to cope with who are actually struggling to live on a very small amount of money each week , ' he told @entity54 's @entity55			2
asked if he would vote against the cap when legislation is drawn up in the new year , he replied : ' i would like to talk to @entity10 colleagues about this but i am very unhappy about it			2
i 'm not happy about some of the welfare cuts at all			2
' fellow @entity10 mp @entity63 also said he was ' distressed ' by the 1 per cent rise , and attacked ' loose language ' from @entity37 who wanted to curb state handouts			1
meanwhile @entity20 has given the clearest indication yet that it will block a cap on welfare handouts , saying that it will ‘ struggle ’ to support the plan			1
shadow business secretary @entity72 fears a below - inflation 1 per cent rise in benefits in each of the next three years will increase child poverty and harm lower - income families			1
‘ unless fundamental changes are made to the proposals that we ’ve seen so far i think we will struggle to support this , ’ he said			1
@entity83 business secretary @entity72 said @entity20 would ' struggle ' to support the cap unless changes are made ' the chancellor is seeking to set up a debate between the so - called strivers on the one hand and people in receipt of benefits on the other , whilst totally and wilfully ignoring the fact that many people who are on benefit are actually in work			1
' six out of ten households that are going to be affected by the cuts that have been announced this week are working households , so to set this up in this way is completely reprehensible because many people who are on benefits and working are striving			0
' the move will dismay the few @entity107 left on @entity20 ’s front line , because it risks suggesting to voters that the party is in denial over the need to cut the size of the welfare state			1
free bus travel will be offered to more than 800,000 unemployed people in an attempt to get them to find a jobs			0
anyone who has been out of work for between three months and a year will be eligible for the @entity123 - wide scheme transport minister @entity124 said : ' good bus services play a huge role in boosting economic growth by helping people to access employment and training opportunities			0
' i have been encouraging bus operators to look at the fare deals they can offer to young people looking for work , so i congratulate the operators that are doing so in january and look forward to seeing other offers in the future			0
' the scheme has been organised by a coalition of transport bodies			0
claimants will need to hold a @entity144 , which already entitles them to half - price journeys			0
@entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 are among the operators signed up to the deal , which covers 70 % of routes in @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156			0
the government is to introduce a @entity158 to enshrine the one per cent cap in law – forcing the @entity161 into a corner over whether to oppose limits in welfare which polls show are popular with the public			1
work and pensions secretary @entity167 will today tell @entity168 that three million families will be better off by an average of £ 168 a month after multiple benefits are replaced by a single , universal credit			2
the new system is designed to ensure it always pays to take a job or work more hours			0
under cuts outlined by mr @entity2 last week , working age benefits will not rise in line with inflation - due to be 2.2 per cent next year - but will be capped at one per cent for each of the next three years			1
the chancellor told @entity168 the changes were needed because ' fairness is about being fair to the person who leaves home every morning to go out to work and sees their neighbour still asleep , living a life on benefits '			0
he said @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 would be affected			0
but the changes also affect maternity pay - with @entity20 dubbing the plans a ' @entity197 '			1
business secretary @entity198 attacking the ' demonisation ' of people on benefits			1
' given the country 's now poorer than it was before the banks collapsed , we have a massive budget deficit , we 've going to have to look at the welfare budget because it 's rising so much up up in forms of public spending , ' he told @entity211			0
' so certainly we should look at it , but we should n't gloat over the misfortune of others			0
the majority of people who are affected by this are actually in work and i think what we should be talking about a bit more is he steps the government has taken to lift the tax threshold for people who are in low pay and are in work - that goes some way to offset the pressures on them			0
' chief secretary to the treasury @entity231 , a @entity10 , denied the squeeze will hit lower - income working families			2
the @entity10 mp said they would be more than compensated by other measures , including a rise in the basic - rate income tax threshold to £ 9,440			0
officials said that overall the average working family would be £ 125 a year better off next year			0
in a @entity245 survey yesterday , 52 per cent of voters backed the cap or said benefits should not rise at all , against 35 per cent who said the government is wrong			1
in an email to party members , mr @entity16 sought to distance himself from the policy			0
the @entity10 leader wrote : ‘ we worked to limit the impact of the next wave of cuts on low income families , ruling out the abolition of child benefit for families with two or more children , and saying we should keep housing benefit for under - 25s who need a place to stay			2
‘ the welfare savings are less than half of the £ 10 billion cuts first floated			0
they give people on benefits exactly the same rise as we are giving in pay to nurses , civil servants and everyone else in the public sector			0

backbenchers @entity35 and @entity63 *criticise* plan to limit rises to one per cent for each of the next three years
@entity83 business secretary @entity72 said @entity20 would ' struggle ' to support cap unless changes were made
