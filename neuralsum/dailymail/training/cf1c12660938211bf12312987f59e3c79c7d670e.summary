the @entity0 referred to @entity2 's poignant song in a @entity4 homily @entity2 ’s anthem imagine is a ‘ heart - chilling vision ’ that has misled the world about the causes of war , a senior @entity12 bishop said yesterday			1
( @entity13 ) @entity2 ’s song is just a lazy repetition of the ‘ ill - founded belief ’ that religion causes wars , the @entity0 , the right reverend @entity14 , said			1
but the wars of the 20th century were inspired by secular and @entity22 ideologies , the @entity0 said			1
he condemned the 1971 @entity2 song in a @entity4 homily calling for recognition of the @entity27 nature of the festival at a time when , he said , schools , public officials and state institutions are trying to sweep away any connection between religion and seasonal celebrations			1
the former @entity38 ’s immensely popular song calls on its listeners to imagine a world with no religion where everyone lives in peace			1
@entity44 said that the @entity4 1914 truce between @entity52 and @entity53 soldiers ‘ is universally recognised as a brief moment of humanity amidst the death and destruction of the @entity49			0
’ he added : ‘ the events of @entity55 give the lie to the lazily repeated assertion that religion is the cause of wars			2
‘ @entity2 would give voice to this ill - founded belief in the lyrics of his song imagine			1
this becomes a heart - chilling vision in which @entity2 imagines a world with no hope of heaven and no fear of hell			2
and , he adds , “ no religion too ”			0
‘ only then , he suggests , will “ all the people ” be “ living life in peace ”			0
‘ yet the fact is , the wars of the century past , bringing with them atrocities on a scale never seen before , were largely inspired by secularist and , indeed , anti-christian ideologies			0
in reality , it is human sin which lies at the root cause of war			1
’ @entity44 , 55 , who has led the @entity89 diocese since 2010 , added : ‘ in @entity52 today we are told that two thirds of schools now substitute a “ winter celebration ” for the nativity story ; civil servants , it is reported , are advised not to use the word @entity4 to avoid giving offence ; and most civic authorities limit themselves to voicing merely “ seasonal greetings ”			0
‘ how much we need to be reminded on this @entity4 2014 that the greatest message for peace and the cohesion of society is being lost amongst us , ’ the bishop said			0
the right reverend @entity14 referred to the song as well as the @entity106 in 1914 for the service the @entity0 said the singer ( pictured with partner @entity109 before his death ) repeated the ' ill founded belief ' that wars were started by religion @entity44 is regarded as a firm supporter of traditionalist values among the @entity12 bishops of @entity117 and @entity118			1
in 2012 he said in his @entity4 message that same - sex marriage was an attempt to undermine marriage and religion in the name of progress			2
this he said , was similar to the way that nazis and communists rejected religion in the name of progress			0
the @entity2 song – once described by its author as ‘ virtually the @entity133 ’ - remains a revered highlight of pop history , and @entity137 magazine has rated it at number three among the 500 greatest songs of all time			2
@entity2 was shot dead by a fan in december 1980			0
the record producer who worked on @entity143 , @entity142 , is currently serving a prison sentence of 19 years to life for the murder of an aspiring actress in 2003 .			0

@entity0 condemned lyrics ' imagine no religion ' in homily
he added the song was of ' ill - founded belief ' that religions start wars
right reverend @entity14 said ' human sin ' lay at the root of *conflicts*
