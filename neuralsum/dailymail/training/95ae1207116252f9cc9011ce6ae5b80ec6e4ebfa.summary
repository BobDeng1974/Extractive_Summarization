by @entity0 published : 20:47 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 05:31 est , 7 february 2013 major serial : @entity4 , the new drama starring @entity3 , is a $ 100million tv series commissioned exclusively for streaming service @entity7 what is going on in the world of home entertainment ? @entity11 - winning actor @entity3 recreates a machiavellian anti-hero from one of @entity16 tv ’s best - loved dramas , and virtually no one is watching			1
if you live in @entity19 , you might have seen posters featuring a presidential @entity3 posing on the stone throne of the @entity23 , fingers gripping the armrests			1
but that ’s probably all you ’ve seen of it			2
even if you ’re one of the estimated one million @entity16 subscribers with access to watch @entity4 via an @entity31 internet service , you probably wo n’t be glued to the same episodes as anyone else you know			1
the entire series , all 13 parts of it , was dumped online last friday , like a bootlegged box - set of dvds falling off the back of a lorry			1
for @entity4 is a television spectacular that is n’t on tv			1
instead , the $ 100million series is being ‘ streamed ’ on the web via @entity7 — a £ 5.99 monthly subscription service that lets users watch broadcast content via the internet , on a computer , a tablet or a phone			1
you could view it on a high - definition telly hooked up to an online games console			1
what you ca n’t do is switch on the tv and watch it on any conventional channel , no matter how many your satellite package offers			1
this is the first time a major serial has been commissioned exclusively for a streaming web service and , at $ 100m represents a bold gamble by @entity7			1
the expense and sheer quality of the show emphasise that it is intended as a competitor to the biggest @entity31 series — a web - only equivalent of @entity73 or @entity74			1
@entity3 plays a conniving @entity76 kingmaker who decides to put the @entity78 crown on his own head after the new president breaks a promise to appoint him secretary of state			1
his wife , played as an ice queen by @entity85 , is ruthless , heartless and quietly insane — a modern - day @entity86			2
it achieves a chilling atmosphere of camp , rare in @entity31 dramas			2
@entity3 plays congressman @entity92 as a chain - smoking aesthete , an habitue of art galleries and the opera , who reacts with physical revulsion to the thought of exercise when his wife buys him a rowing machine			1
but he is also cold - bloodedly diabolical , able to destroy an old friend ’s career as dispassionately as he chokes an injured dog to death			2
the original @entity4 aired as a four - part series on @entity109 in 1990 , starring @entity110 as a @entity112 chief whip whose scheming mind goes into hyperdrive after the resignation of the prime minister			1
it was the @entity109 ’s good fortune that the screening coincided with the overthrow of @entity120			2
screenwriter @entity121 had adapted the novel by @entity123 — who had worked as the @entity112 ’s chief of staff under @entity120 — and it soon became compulsive sunday night viewing throughout @entity16			2
at @entity131 , the new prime minister @entity127 ( once a whip himself ) and his staff apparently dropped whatever they were doing to watch it			2
and they were n’t the only ones			2
across @entity16 , more than 15m a week were gripped			0
@entity110 ’s urbane , devious catchphrase — ‘ you might think that ; i could n’t possibly comment ’ — was on every tongue ( and is occasionally used by @entity3 in the new version )			1
star : @entity3 as @entity92 in the programme @entity4 , which is exclusive to @entity7 risk : the $ 100million for @entity4 represents a big gamble for @entity7 it was sensational tv , a talking point in offices and pubs everywhere			1
that almost half the adult viewers in @entity16 were united in watching this modern take on a @entity152 revenge tragedy created a communal feeling			0
@entity155 entertainment that brought the nation to a halt was not a new concept			0
at its height in the @entity162 , the radio sitcom @entity160 was so popular that pubs emptied when it aired — everyone wanted to be at home , listening and laughing with the family			0
the streets were abandoned when @entity168 was on			0
it is this collective experience that has been sacrificed to technology			0
the convenience of being able to watch what we want , on any format , in any place from a bedroom to a bus , has come at a colossal cost — we watch alone			0
family : the collective experience of sharing television has been sacrificed by technology what once bound families and created communities is now a lonely , divisive ritual we can not share			0
tv ca n’t bring us together any more ; it splits us up			2
we have screens in every room — and instead of family debates and compromises , teaching children negotiation and fair play , everybody is free to be as moodily selfish as they like			0
a pocket - size touchscreen device and a set of headphones might mean children can watch a favourite show in the palm of a hand , while screening out conversations around them , but it also prevents anyone watching with them			0
' what once bound families and created communities is now a lonely , divisive ritual we can not share			0
tv ca n’t bring us together any more ; it splits us up ' @entity7 is currently a sideshow — largely filled with half - forgotten tv shows and old movies for users to rummage through			1
it ’s like the world ’s biggest second - hand dvd market stall			0
it has an estimated 27.5m subscribers in the @entity31 , but barely a tenth of that in the rest of the world , and runs at a loss			0
even when it makes new material available , such as the zombie drama @entity230 ( previously shown on cable channel @entity231 ) , viewing figures are underwhelming : 200,000 fans opted to watch the whole series in the first 24 hours — a huge number with nothing better to do , but a tiny blip in the overall tv market			1
small wonder @entity7 executives say they wo n’t be publishing audience figures for @entity4			1
they are no doubt underwhelming			0
the release of all 13 episodes at once , enabling fans to watch them back - to - back , gorging themselves in square - eyed binges , has other implications for tv traditions			1
gone are the flashback summaries that open each episode in many conventional series — viewers do n’t need them if watching a continuous stream			0
@entity7 executives do n’t like the term ‘ bingeing ’ to describe this phenomenon — it sounds unhealthy			1
alone : gadgets allow people to watch tv when they want , but nobody can watch it with them they prefer ‘ marathoning ’			2
but they accept that viewers tend to gobble up shows so fast that plot summaries are superfluous			0
‘ we assume you know what ’s happening , whereas tv has to assume a big chunk of the audience is always tuning in [ for the first time ] , ’ said @entity265 , @entity7 ’s chief content officer			1
that ignores traditional viewers , the vast majority			0
much as we ’d like to sit in our pyjamas and bask in television rays like lizards soaking up sunshine , we have other obligations			0
if producers dispense with potted explanations and expect us to use @entity283 to find out what happened last week , tv will become a chore			2
imagine coping with complex dramas such as @entity287 without a flurry of intercut moments from previous weeks to refresh the memory and set the scene			0
@entity293 , the producer of @entity4 , predicts dramas will soon be made in a single flow , as long as blockbuster novels , ten or 20 hours of programming without a break : he ’d like to ‘ dispense with episodes altogether , ’ he said , ‘ you decide where to pause			1
’ at that point , the concept of tension , of cliffhangers , of everything that makes drama compelling , is lost			2
the rhythm and discipline imposed on scriptwriters and directors will evaporate			0
@entity4 is scheduled in 50 - minute episodes , a conventional format but there ’s no reason — they might as well run for 20 minutes or three hours			1
technology has n’t just fragmented the market — it has shattered it into smithereens			0
perhaps that ’s a good thing			0
we ’ve been in thrall to the telly for a lifetime ; maybe we should all switch off and do something more constructive instead			0
but as a confirmed gogglebox addict , all i can say is : ‘ you might think that ; i could n’t possibly comment			0
