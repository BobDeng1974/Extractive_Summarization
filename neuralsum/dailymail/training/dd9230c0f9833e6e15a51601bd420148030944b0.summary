after what happened at @entity1 last time , perhaps it was n’t surprising that @entity3 was among the first batch of players to show up at @entity6 on sunday for the @entity7			1
two years ago , it was only because a @entity10 policeman went beyond the call of duty that he made it to the first tee at all			1
the story of @entity3 mixing up his time zones and arriving on the premises in a blaze of police sirens before walking out to play @entity20 in a vital singles match without so much as barely a practice swing has , of course , become part of @entity7 lore			1
@entity25 golfer @entity3 can not wait to participate at this year 's @entity7 @entity3 of @entity26 practices on the range ahead of the @entity28 at @entity6 on sunday what does he think , looking back ? does he still break out in a cold sweat ? ‘ i think i would have relived it a lot more if i had n’t gone on to win my match , ’ he told @entity31			1
‘ can you imagine how bad i would have felt if i ’d had to forfeit my game ? honestly , even now i do n’t want to think about it			1
‘ it ’s one of those scenarios where you ’re just thankful everything worked out the way it did			1
i still would have felt really bad if i ’d made the tee - time and lost			1
i was one of the guys at the front , with the team relying on me to get a point and establish some momentum			1
‘ what ’s funny is that it was the best i played all week			1
i kept telling myself , ‘ ‘ stay in the match while i get warmed up and calm down ’ ’ , and yet after six holes i was two up			1
’ given the horrific build - up , how proud was he of the round he played ? @entity3 celebrates winning the @entity7 in 2012 - his second of two wins while representing @entity26 tuesday & wednesday 6.30am : gates open for practice rounds thursday 6.30am : gates open for practice rounds 2.30pm : opening ceremony friday 7.35am : 4 x @entity62 matches 1.15pm : 4 x @entity66 matches saturday 7.35am : 4 x @entity62 matches 1.15pm : 4 x @entity66 matches sunday 11.36am : 12 x @entity69 matches ( at 12 - minute intervals ) ‘ oh , not that proud , ’ he said			1
‘ i guess i ’m proud of the way i regrouped and stayed composed , but there ’s not much else to be proud about			2
there are quite a few rounds i ’ll recall with a lot more pride than that one			2
’ and the sheriff — has he kept in touch with him ? ‘ no , we ’ve had no contact since			2
but i ’ll certainly be for ever grateful for what he did for me that day			2
’ five years ago , @entity3 ’s ambivalence towards the @entity7 was documented in one of those fateful expressions that follow a player around			1
an ‘ exhibition ’ he called it , with the innocence of a man who had grown up thinking only about majors as the hallmark of a player ’s greatness			2
when did he change his mind ? ‘ oh , when i arrived at @entity98 for my first one in 2010 and walked into the team room , ’ he said , smiling			1
‘ then there was the first tee on the first morning with the songs and the atmosphere			2
‘ i could n’t understand why people made such a big deal of it , or got so excited			2
i mean , we ’re individuals , not team players , and we play for ourselves for the most part			2
but once you ’ve been part of it , you know it ’s the ultimate buzz			2
‘ i ’ve been lucky enough to finish on the winning side in two really close ones now and it is fantastic to celebrate as a team on that sunday night			2
’ @entity3 was right there when everything changed at @entity1 , partnering @entity121 in that unforgettable fourballs match on saturday where they birdied the last six holes between them to narrow the deficit to four points ( 10 - 6 ) heading into the singles			1
‘ i think that ’s the only time on a golf course where i ’ve watched someone and been in awe , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ up until those last six holes we had been flat but we kept encouraging each other			2
make a putt somewhere , just quieten the crowd			2
i guess when i birdied the 13th it was the spark — and then i stepped aside and he did his thing with his five birdies			2
‘ i remember the putts going in clearly at 15 and 16 but the one at 18			0
i thought he ’d pushed it , to be honest			0
then it curls back into the hole and he gives it those eyes			0
i was thinking , “ this guy is unbelievable ”			0
’ @entity3 was pictured with @entity149 footballer @entity148 on saturday night as the pair watched @entity152 ' fight against @entity153 at @entity154 just as he did back then , @entity3 goes into this @entity7 as the best player in the world			1
this time , though , the stakes are higher			0
he ’s on home soil with everyone of @entity26 hue counting on him to build on his wondrous summer filled with majors and other successes , and lead from the front			1
happily , the man himself is excited at the prospect			0
‘ i ’m ready to be the talisman and drive this team forward , ’ he said			0
‘ i realise i have that responsibility and i am comfortable with it			0
in my first two i felt out of place offering an opinion , but i appreciate i have a place in the game now that warrants that			0
i know i can lead this team			0
’ in his two @entity7 appearances to date , @entity3 has played nine matches , with four wins , three losses and two halves			1
not bad , by any means , but he agrees we have n’t seen the best of him			0
‘ the best i ’ve played was when i turned up 11 minutes before my tee - time , ’ he joked			0
‘ no , i feel like i ’ve done ok over the two matches			0
i got three points out of five at @entity1 , so i contributed well enough			0
but it ’s fair to say i have n’t been firing on all cylinders at a @entity7			1
‘ the first one , i was trying not to make mistakes and let the team down , which really is n’t the way i play			0
now i know what to expect and hopefully i can kick it back into top gear this week			0
’ there ’s also one additional incentive for replicating his major - winning form			0
@entity3 is happy to be playing under @entity26 captain @entity196 after giving the @entity197 his backing eighteen months ago , @entity3 went into bat for @entity196 to get the captain ’s job over @entity3 ’s fellow @entity202 , @entity203			1
in so doing , he swayed opinion decisively			0
now he is determined that @entity196 will see out his illustrious @entity7 career — three wins from three appearances as a player , two wins from two stints as vice-captain — in fitting fashion			1
‘ i ’d played under @entity196 at the @entity213 , and knew he ’d make a great @entity7 captain , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ he holed the winning putt in 2002 , so he knows how that feels			0
that ’s why i was so supportive			0
‘ i ’m going to be trying particularly hard for the team , but also for @entity196 because i ’m a huge fan of him both as a golfer and a man			0
‘ nowadays the captain only gets one chance at this , and it would n’t be right if he did n’t end up as a winning captain			0
the @entity7 has meant so much to him , so it would be a bitter - sweet ending if it was n’t to work out for us			1
’ when it ’s over , @entity3 will stay in @entity230 to play in the @entity231 with his father @entity232 , who will celebrate his 55th birthday during the tournament			1
@entity235 fan @entity3 , pictured posing with the @entity236 , can not wait to return to @entity237 over the @entity239 period thereafter , he is off to @entity240 and the @entity241 to complete the formalities of finishing the season as @entity26 ’s no 1 , before wrapping up at the end of november with the defence of the @entity248 title he won so memorably against @entity249			1
‘ it ’s the simple things i ’m looking forward to after that , ’ said the 25 - year - old , who has just bought a house back in his hometown of @entity254 , near @entity255			0
‘ watching a few @entity260 rugby games and going to @entity237			0
having about 10 turkey dinners before @entity239			0
’ eleven minutes away from being a prize turkey himself at @entity1 , he is emphatic there will be no such drama at @entity6			0
‘ we ’re staying in the hotel on site , so i could fall out of bed and still make it to the first tee on time , ’ he said , laughing			0
as the summer of his life fades into blissful memory , @entity3 is primed and ready for an autumn awakening .			1
