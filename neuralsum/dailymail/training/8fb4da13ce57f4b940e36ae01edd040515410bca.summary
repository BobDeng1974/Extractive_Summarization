by @entity0 last updated at 9:31 am on 1st december 2011 @entity1 today made the first visit to @entity3 by a @entity5 secretary of state for more than 50 years			1
the diplomatically fraught trip , which will include face - to - face meetings with former members of the military junta , is aimed at persuading @entity3 to sever military and nuclear ties with @entity12			1
during the visit , mrs @entity1 will also visit opposition leader and @entity16 peace laureate @entity15 , who was freed from detention earlier this year			1
historic : @entity1 , arriving in @entity19 , is the first @entity5 secretary of state to visit @entity3 in more than 50 years new ground : mrs @entity1 will visit former members of the @entity3 military junta , as well as opposition leader @entity15 ' i am obviously looking to determine for myself and on behalf of our government what is the intention of the current government with respect to continuing reforms both political and economic , ' she said after arriving in the capital @entity19			1
' we and many other nations are quite hopeful that these flickers of progress ... will be ignited into a movement for change that will benefit the people of the country			0
' mrs @entity1 was greeted at @entity19 's airfield by a deputy foreign minister , but her presence appears to have taken second stage to the expected arrival tomorrow of the prime minister of @entity45			1
posters have been put up for his visit , and @entity45 has a similar human rights ' record to @entity3			1
officials said she was seeking assurances from @entity3 's leaders that they will sign an agreement with the @entity55 nuclear watchdog that will permit unfettered access to suspected nuclear sites			1
entourage : mrs @entity1 's motorcade drives through the capital @entity19 , but she received a modest welcome ceremony : local police officers salute as mrs @entity1 drives past			1
the visit is diplomatically fraught because of @entity3 's human rights record the @entity5 and other @entity67 nations suspect @entity3 has sought and received nuclear advice along with ballistic missile technology from @entity12			2
the trip is the first major development in @entity5 - @entity3 relations in decades and comes after the @entity75 administration launched a new effort to promote reform in 2009			0
@entity5 's special envoy to @entity3 has made three trips to the country in the last three months			2
reforms : a farmer drives is ox carriage in the heart of @entity3			0
the country has undergone decades of brutal rule by successive military juntas @entity12 today said it is making rapid progress on enriching uranium and building a light - water nuclear power plant			2
a statement from the @entity92 said that @entity12 has a sovereign right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and that ' neither concession nor compromise should be allowed '			0
concerns about its atomic capability took on renewed urgency in november 2010 when it disclosed a uranium enrichment facility that could give it a second route to manufacture nuclear weapons			0
@entity12 has been building a light - water reactor at its @entity108 nuclear complex since last year			0
such a reactor is ostensibly for civilian energy purposes , but it would give the country a reason to enrich uranium			0
at high levels , uranium can be used in nuclear bombs			0
@entity117 has said the reactor would violate @entity120 resolutions			0
president @entity121 , a former army officer , has pushed reforms forward after decades of repression under successive military regimes which cancelled the 1990 elections that @entity15 's @entity126 won			1
last week , @entity3 's parliament approved a law guaranteeing the right to protest , which had not previously existed , and improvements have been made in areas including media and internet access			2
but the government that took office in march is still dominated by a military - proxy political party and commitments to democratisation and a willingness to limit ties with @entity141 are uncertain			2
corruption is rampant and hundreds of political prisoners remain jailed			0
@entity3 's army continues to torture and kill civilians in campaigns to stamp out some of the world 's longest - running insurgencies			2
@entity141 laid down a marker ahead of mrs @entity1 's trip by having its vice president meet the head of @entity3 's armed forces on monday			1
the country also remains subject to tough sanctions that prohibit @entity5 and @entity5 companies from most commercial transactions in the country .			0

secretary of state 's visit overshadowed by that of prime minister of @entity45 on *friday* , for whom posters have been put up
mrs @entity1 will meet former leaders of military junta , as well as opposition icon @entity15
