@entity0 pictured leaving @entity2 @entity1 yesterday where she is on trial for allegations she helped her boyfriend evade police after he brutally beat and burgled an elderly man a young mother took selfies of herself with her boyfriend while he was on the run for leaving a pensioner to die following a burglary , a court heard			1
@entity0 , 25 , also helped @entity16 , 24 , evade capture during a police manhunt by acting as his ' eyes on the ground , ' it was alleged			1
yesterday a jury at @entity22 heard that she hid @entity16 in her home from detectives and then drove @entity16 to a friend 's house using a story that the pair had fallen out and needed some time apart			1
earlier , @entity16 had attacked 87 - year old widower @entity29 during a raid when the pensioner awoke to find him in his bedroom standing over him and demanding cash			1
during the attack @entity16 wrapped his vest around his fist and punched him repeatedly around the face before fleeing with his wallet and bank book			1
the victim , a grandfather - of - two , from @entity41 , @entity2 , died in hospital less than three weeks later			2
@entity16 was subsequently convicted of murder			2
@entity0 , a mother - of - one , admitted knowing @entity16 had burgled the house of a nearby acquaintance on the night of august 3 last year but denied having any knowledge of the attack on mr @entity29			1
but the jury were shown phone transcripts where she asked her boyfriend ' where are the passports ? ' after police came knocking			2
prosecuting , @entity55 said : ' on the face of it this suggests they are going to get out of the @entity41 area completely			0
is that the sort of response you might expect of a boyfriend and girlfriend as a consequence of the knowledge of just one burglary where a touch screen computer was taken ? or a burglary where an 87 - year - old man was beaten to the point where he died a few weeks later ? ' they were also shown ' selfies ' the pair snapped together hours after the robbery of widower mr @entity29 - which prove her ' motivation ' for hiding him , it was said			1
mr @entity55 added : ' her loyalty was such she wanted to protect him at all costs , possibly even ahead of her own self			0
' there is a snapshot of the state of mind between them through two photos taken on her phone			0
at 5.17am on august 3 you can quite clearly see the defendant and @entity16			2
' @entity98 say of these photographs that whatever difficulties there might have been from the relationship , they were surmounted by the strength of the bond between the two of them			2
' when one is hoping to consider the motivation to help @entity16 avoid the police and avoid responsibility for what he has done , these two photos demonstrate this defendant 's attitude at a time so shortly after two burglaries and an assault - and you will be assessing this defendant 's knowledge of those events - but these two photos do give some insight into the mood that morning			1
