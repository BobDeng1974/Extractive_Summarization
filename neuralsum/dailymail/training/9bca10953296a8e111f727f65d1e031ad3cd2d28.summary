by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the argument to drop @entity3 — if there has to be one — starts with @entity6 , who is the @entity7 player most likely to score a goal at the moment			1
@entity6 has earned the right to be considered @entity7 ’s centre forward after a prolific season at @entity13 and goals in his last two internationals			1
under pressure : @entity3 , who arrived in @entity17 with @entity7 on sunday night , faces calls to be axed from @entity20 's starting line - up pain game : @entity22 winces after coming off worse in a challenge with @entity3 on friday night on their way : @entity3 arrives at @entity26 as @entity7 began their journey to @entity17 plenty to ponder : @entity20 named a strong team , including @entity3 , for the final game on home soil before the @entity32 with 27 goals in 38 games for club and country , he has forced @entity20 to hand over the no 9 shirt and play him in the centre , nearest the goal , rather than out wide as he has in the past			1
this means finding somewhere else for @entity3 to operate			1
it ought not to be a problem			0
he can simply play off @entity6 , in the no 10 role , or even alongside him in ( whisper it ) something like a 4 - 4 - 2 formation			2
for a long time , @entity3 ’s best position was thought to be off the main striker , between the lines of midfield and attack			1
but in general his most productive games for @entity7 , since @entity55 , have been as a centre forward			1
he has enjoyed two purple patches : one under @entity59 in qualification for the @entity61 , often playing alongside @entity62 , and another since @entity20 took over , with 10 of his 38 international goals in 16 games under the current manager			0
@entity6 , however , is not conducive to strike partnerships			2
ruthless : @entity7 coach @entity67 has spoken about not playing the best players but the best team even at @entity13 this season , where he and @entity70 have been brilliant , @entity6 had a better goals - per - minute ratio without the @entity75			1
in the last two @entity7 games , he has come alive , seemed freer , using the space left once @entity3 has been replaced — after an hour against @entity78 and after 66 minutes against @entity79			1
do they inhibit each other ? does @entity20 sacrifice @entity3 to get more from @entity6 , who is four years younger ? at 28 , this could even be @entity3 ’s final @entity32 , playing as he does in a young man ’s position			1
does @entity20 persevere with them together ? should @entity7 use their two friendlies in @entity17 , against @entity87 on wednesday and @entity88 on saturday , to work on a better understanding and improve @entity3 ’s match - sharpness ? friday ’s 3 - 0 win against @entity79 was @entity3 ’s first game in more than a month			1
although he worked hard and looks in superb physical condition , he may appreciate another chance to play and refine his touch ; perhaps even find his first international goal since october			0
all aboard : the @entity7 squad have flown to @entity17 to continue their @entity32 preparations yet to make a mark : the 28 - year - old has n't scored for @entity7 at a @entity32 and time could be running out ‘ our plan on wednesday is basically to start the people who did n’t start on friday , ’ said @entity20			1
‘ that would be the plan , but plans like that sometimes go astray and i ’m not prepared to make any promises			0
’ the argument is complicated by the emergence of others			0
@entity113 ’s international career has started with promise , while @entity20 is fond of @entity116 ’s pace			2
against some of the better teams at the @entity32 , particularly against @entity120 in the opening game when possession will be crucial , there must be a temptation for @entity20 to clutter the midfield with three specialists — @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , for example , with wingers either side and one up front			0
alternatively , @entity133 and @entity134 are capable of playing in the hole behind the main striker in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 shape			1
it is where @entity133 played when he first came on for @entity3 against @entity79			2
looking up : @entity3 skips past @entity140 as @entity7 launch an attack ‘ it would be stupid for me to say on the basis of just a few minutes that this is @entity133 ’s best position , ’ said @entity20			1
‘ i ’m not even certain i necessarily want @entity133 to have a best position			0
‘ i want him to be able to play in the position where we need him			0
on friday , we thought it would be good to bring him on initially in the position behind the front player , where we ’ve seen him play well			0
‘ but then we wanted to bring @entity134 on , so we moved him wide and he did ok there			0
i ’m sure he ’s going to be a very big player going forward , but i would rather see some of these younger players treated with a little more caution			2
’ @entity20 warned against an obsession with @entity3 but the mere fact this debate is open is encouraging for @entity7			2
normally these tournaments are preceded by heaping pressure on his shoulders to carry the nation through			0
this time there is an option to use him tactically : send him out for an hour without being afraid to haul him off			0
it might even be a way for him to be more effective , although it will be a brave move by @entity20 , with no way of knowing how he might react to being left out			0
it is not a question of discarding him , it is about getting the best from him			0
@entity3 will be a key weapon for @entity7 at the @entity32 .			2
