in their navy tailcoats and sky blue silk bow ties , and with the desert as a backdrop , they do not look like the typical grouse - shooting party			1
but this is the new breed of members of the infamous @entity8			1
and instead of donning tweed and taking to the @entity12 moors , they chose to celebrate the @entity13 earlier this month in the more exotic surroundings of the @entity16 veldt			1
on guard : the 2013 @entity8 travelled to @entity16 for a spot of hunting ( for a who 's who , see below , number nine could not be identified ) @entity24 ’s notorious male - only dining society — whose alumni include @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 — usually pose for their annual photo on the steps of @entity32 , the @entity24 college			1
the club is famously discreet about its membership and gatherings			2
but today the @entity37 can reveal the latest line - up of ‘ @entity40 men ’ and their antics			2
standing arm - in - arm , the class of 2013 show off their haul of game after a day ’s sand grouse shooting			1
the gathered party of current and recent members illustrates how the invitation - only club continues to be open only to the super-rich or those from aristocratic families			2
the presence of @entity55 , the son of @entity57 treasurer @entity56 — a close ally of @entity27 who has donated £ 4million to the @entity57 — shows how closely it is linked to the high echelons of the party			1
others in the group , which flew into @entity63 before taking a private plane to the shoot , include the great - grandson of the founder of @entity68 and a member of one of @entity72 ’s most powerful dynasties			2
on board the small aircraft used to fly the men to the exclusive jaunt , each seat pocket was filled not with an in - flight magazine but with a bottle of champagne			1
while on the five - day shoot , the men — who are without exception the product of incredible privilege — donned the 200 - year - old society ’s formal dress			2
haunted : chancellor @entity28 and prime minister @entity27 , left , have been embarrassed by their @entity8 photographs			1
and mr @entity28 , right , with @entity89 in the first club picture the class of ' 87 : buller men @entity27 ( back , second left ) and @entity29 ( front right ) the full uniform , which costs around £ 3,500 is usually worn for the @entity8 ’s annual dinner			1
but the members seemed eager to pose in the @entity16 desert in their specially - tailored navy tailcoats , each with a matching velvet collar , offset with ivory silk lapel revers , brass monogrammed buttons , a mustard waistcoat and bow tie			1
after successfully shooting dozens of sand grouse , which are regarded as the kings of @entity16 game birds , the group quaffed more champagne before leaving discarded corks in the dirt			1
members perhaps felt at ease dressed in their full regalia , being so far from @entity24 where the ‘ modern @entity40 ’ rarely wears the full attire for fear of attracting attention			2
even as a student , @entity28 was ferociously ambitious sand grouse shoots , which typically last two hours , take place around the waterholes where the birds come in to drink during the mornings			1
the birds have small pigeon - like heads and necks but sturdy compact bodies and incredibly tough skin			2
the @entity8 was founded in 1780 and has a notorious reputation for its destructive binges			1
it is banned from meeting within 15 miles of @entity24 since a dinner in 1927 when its member smashed every window in a college quad			2
former members ran riot around the town for decades , paying thousands of pounds in cash to buy the silence of dining establishments they damaged during their disorderly evenings			2
@entity27 and @entity28 have seemed embarrassed by the emergence of photographs of them dressed in their @entity40 ‘ uniform ’			1
other former members include @entity151 , @entity152 and broadcaster @entity153			2
one of the nine men on the grouse - shooting trip is unidentified , but the other 2013 @entity156 are : 1 the hon @entity157 the great - grandson of @entity157 , the @entity160 co-founder of @entity68 , he will one day be the 4th @entity161 of @entity162			1
