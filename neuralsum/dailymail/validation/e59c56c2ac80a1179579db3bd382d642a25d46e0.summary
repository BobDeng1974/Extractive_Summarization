@entity1 football agents are to take legal action against the @entity3 unless a compromise can be reached over the introduction of ‘ unworkable ’ new regulations next month			1
the @entity7 agreed unanimously this week to injunct the @entity3 to prevent them from bringing in ‘ unacceptable ’ rules from april 1 - after @entity9 washed their hands of responsibility for managing the middle men , passing the buck to the national associations			1
the @entity7 have engaged the @entity15 and sports law expert @entity16 to fight their corner - with the threat of an injunction hovering over a summit with the @entity3 called to resolve the issue			1
the @entity7 have engaged the @entity15 and sports law expert @entity16 to fight their corner over new @entity3 rules the agents object to the way the @entity3 intend to administer their lucrative work			1
this includes a reduction in fees , no pay for representing players under 18 and a free - for - all with no agent ’s licence required in future			0
@entity35 , chairman of the @entity7 , said : ‘ there is no doubt that the upcoming regulations are unworkable and it will be an horrendous mess unless some agreement can be reached			2
at least finalising a meeting is some kind of progress			0
’ the @entity3 , who are understood to have chosen the successor to general secretary @entity45 , were certainly aiming high with their original wish list			1
it is understood to have included @entity49 @entity48 team principal @entity50 , who is said to have been asked whether he was interested in leaving his £ 6million - a - year job in motor racing to earn 10 times less at @entity53			1
you can imagine his quick answer			0
it is understood @entity48 principal @entity50 was asked to succeed @entity3 general secretary @entity45 former @entity61 no 1 tennis player @entity60 , better known for his extreme right - wing political views , has been barred from membership of the @entity64 for six weeks			1
@entity60 , 59 , who plays regular social tennis at @entity66 when not involved in games of bridge , refused to comment on the reasons for his suspension			0
the secretive club , who do n’t like talking about their internal business even when staging the @entity66 , also refused to discuss his misdemeanour			0
@entity60 , pictured in 1955 , has been barred from membership of the @entity64 for six weeks the @entity3 have expressed anger with the @entity3 over their plans to field @entity78 football teams at the @entity79 without consultation			2
@entity3 president @entity81 said he was ‘ livid and absolutely gutted with the @entity89 ’ , while @entity83 chief executive @entity82 wants to be involved in all decision - making around 2016 , having been given the impression that participation in the @entity87 was going to be a one - off			2
the @entity3 say they have asked the three other home nations where they stand			2
the @entity3 were under the impression a @entity78 football team at the @entity93 was a one - off @entity94 there is a major split developing within the @entity3 over chairman @entity99 ’s @entity98 proposals to fund coaching development at the expense of cuts across the board			1
@entity99 ’s initiative , with £ 2.7million per year being switched from other parts of the @entity3 budget to pay for 35 new coach educators to work in the grassroots ( 24 ) and professional game ( 11 ) , has been approved by the @entity3 board			0
but amateur blazers have yet to be convinced about the merits of such expenditure and the resulting 15 per cent cuts being imposed on every department to raise the cash			0
national game chairman @entity117 has written to councillors to inform them of their colleagues ’ concern about the lack of consultation and their fears that the proposed reduction in @entity126 and @entity127 prize - money may have a ‘ devastating effect ’ on some smaller clubs who rely on this money to stay afloat			0
an @entity3 spokesman said the national game had four representatives on the @entity3 board that has approved the proposal and it was up to individual departments where they made cuts			2
there are major splits developing within the @entity3 over @entity99 's proposal to make cuts @entity98 cricket chiefs @entity146 and @entity148 , having presided over abject preparation , performances and team selection at the @entity144 , are fortunate the new @entity150 hierarchy had such low expectations			1
the high command are also busy with restructuring the organisation , so axeing the team leadership pair is not on their agenda			0
this probably means @entity146 and @entity148 will have this summer ’s @entity159 series to secure their jobs .			0

the @entity7 have engaged sports law expert @entity16 to fight their corner
@entity7 unanimously agreed to injuct @entity3 from bringing in ' unacceptable ' rules
it is understood @entity50 was asked to succeed @entity45
@entity49 @entity48 team principal asked to become @entity3 general secretary
