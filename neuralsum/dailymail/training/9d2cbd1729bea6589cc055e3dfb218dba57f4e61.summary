by @entity0 back in the 1990s , @entity1 enjoyed stealing a moment behind the desk of the then @entity5 attorney @entity4			2
‘ the office felt pretty good , ’ joked @entity1 , then a young prosecutor			1
‘ i liked the chair			0
’ in 2005 , that chair in arguably the most prestigious prosecutor ’s office in @entity5 - @entity11 , with responsibility for eight counties including @entity14 - was his			2
after being sworn in , this son of a shipping company worker and a housewife from @entity20 , @entity21 , ‘ shut the door for a few minutes , just to absorb it ’			2
the law man : @entity24 s investigation into alleged corruption has ruffled feathers among the @entity28 membership now @entity1 ’s fame extends much further than the lower tip of @entity31			1
on monday he was in @entity32 - temperature 37 ° c - as part of his inquiry into alleged corruption in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity37			0
the globe ’s biggest sport awaits his findings			0
but we need not wait as long as was expected after the @entity42 this week published further claims about the scale of secret payments @entity46 made to host the @entity47			1
his need to evaluate new evidence might have delayed his inquiry by months			0
but after meeting @entity46 officials in neutral @entity32 , he said he would close the investigation on monday and submit his dossier of evidence to @entity28 ’s ethics committee in @entity56			1
‘ the report will consider all evidence potentially related to the bidding process , ’ he said			2
@entity28 appointed @entity1 , now 53 , two years ago			1
he was an assistant in the @entity5 attorney ’s office from 1992 to 2001 , prosecuting @entity64 terrorists who bombed @entity5 embassies in @entity66 in 1998 and four defendants in the 1993 @entity69 bombing case			0
he was under - secretary at @entity71 , in charge of the @entity73 , before president @entity74 appointed him a @entity5 attorney			0
in charge of 230 staff , he led the @entity5 government ’s criminal investigations into terrorism while tackling the staples of the @entity83 job , white - collar and organised crime			0
but his spell in @entity31 was not without controversy			0
he was viewed by his detractors as a politicised figure - too close to the @entity74 regime			0
he was meant to be the sheriff of @entity92 , responsible for the financial heart of the city , but failed to lead any aggressive investigation into those arguably responsible for the biggest crash since the @entity98			0
in contrast , he pursued the @entity101 governor , @entity100 who , according to @entity102 , contributing editor at the liberal - leaning @entity103 , was ‘ on the verge of destroying the @entity105 in @entity31 ’			2
talk : @entity1 speaks to the media during the 63rd @entity108 press conference in may last year ‘ @entity1 ’s colleagues had a generally positive impression of him but they ( also ) thought he had cultivated his rise by serving political masters , ’ said @entity102			1
‘ that is what appeared to be happening with @entity100			0
so if you hire him for an investigation it would probably go along a predictable path : it would not embarrass those who hired him or be adverse in any way			0
’ @entity1 , who refused to comment on monday night , has always insisted that he did everything by the book with @entity100 , who paid money to a prostitution ring and resigned			1
someone else with knowledge of @entity1 said he was ‘ thorough and forensic , absolutely clear and calm , and in command of his brief ’			1
after 16 years as a public servant , @entity1 went into lucrative private practice at @entity134 - based @entity133 , where he could earn an estimated £ 2m - £ 3m a year			2
the move was reportedly brought about by @entity137 , a neo-con who wrote @entity74 ’s cell research policy			0
it was while at @entity140 that @entity1 was appointed by @entity28 to investigate the @entity47 votes in 2010 , and the presidential vote a year later			1
@entity28 ’s ethics committee banned @entity144 , the central figure in the @entity42 revelations , from football after @entity1 cited a ‘ conflict of interest ’ in the @entity150 ’s roles as president of the @entity152 and as a @entity28 executive member			1
the @entity42 said @entity1 has not interviewed @entity154 about the @entity47 bidding process because he was not officially linked to the @entity46 bid			1
that would seem a bizarre oversight , given the millions of dollars he is alleged to have handed out as bribes			0
u-turn ? it is thought @entity28 president @entity162 is against @entity46 hosting the @entity47 despite his public backing not that the scope of @entity1 ’s inquiry has failed to create unrest among some @entity28 members			1
despite having been backed by 97 per cent of the governing body ’s membership only a year ago , there was a plot to oust him this march during an executive meeting in @entity173 , where he had arrived unannounced to question delegates			2
that revolt failed , but he was told to hurry up and finish his report before the start of the @entity47 , now nine days away			0
another intriguing question is what @entity162 , the @entity28 president who is universally expected to stand for re-election next year , wants from @entity1			1
it is thought that despite his public backing for @entity46 , @entity162 is opposed to their hosting the @entity47			1
he did not vote for them , unlike his nemesis , @entity186 president @entity185 , whose son @entity187 is a leading figure at @entity46 - backed @entity190 club @entity189			2
@entity162 would , therefore , wound @entity185 if @entity46 were stripped of the @entity47			2
other aspects of @entity46 are believed to irk him : the fact the tournament can not be held in summer , which necessitates a switch to winter			0
that in turn upsets the order of world football and jeopardises @entity28 ’s £ 1billion tv rights deal with @entity200 and @entity201 , a @entity203 subsidiary of @entity204 , to show the football at a time of year when the @entity207 is not in full swing			1
the death of a thousand migrant workers in the building of the stadiums is another reason for @entity46 to be stripped of host status			0
but before @entity28 ’s ethics committee and the executive make their next move , they will study the findings of @entity1 , the father of three who holds the football world in his hands .			1

@entity1 said he would close the investigation into @entity46 *'s* bid for the @entity47 on monday
he will submit his dossier of evidence to @entity28 ’s ethics committee in *mid-july*
@entity28 ’s ethics committee banned @entity144 from football after @entity1 cited a ‘ conflict of interest ’ in the @entity150 ’s roles as president of the @entity152 and as a @entity28 executive member
