by @entity0 published : 07:53 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 20:50 est , 19 march 2012 killer : @entity2 was convicted of murdering five prostitutes in @entity4 the @entity5 was accused yesterday of jeopardising the hunt for the @entity7 by hiring former special forces soldiers to follow officers tracking suspects in the case			1
@entity12 , a retired officer with the @entity13 , told the @entity14 that evidence in the 2006 investigation could have been lost and the prosecution case weakened as a result of the paper ’s actions			2
he said the distraction of avoiding the now - defunct tabloid ’s monitoring could have resulted in the killer being ‘ lost ’ by officers and going on to commit further murders			2
in december 2006 , before anyone was charged in relation to the case , @entity27 asked @entity13 to provide surveillance officers to follow suspects as part of their investigation into the murders of five prostitutes in @entity4			1
during a briefing , mr @entity12 and other @entity13 officers were told the @entity5 had employed its own surveillance team , made up of ex-special forces soldiers , ‘ to identify any suspects we were working on , and to identify us and our operating base ’			2
he said their activities ‘ jeopardised the murder inquiry ’ and could have resulted in ‘ tragic consequences ’			2
‘ if our surveillance had been weakened by having to try and avoid other surveillance teams looking for us , if we had lost the subject , he may have gone and committed further murders because we were dealing with something else , ’ he said			0
asked how the paper knew that @entity13 officers were being sent to @entity4 , he said : ‘ my opinion is it would have come from someone close to the investigation team , either the @entity59 inquiry or @entity13			1
surveillance : @entity12 , a retired officer with the @entity13 , said the @entity61 jeopardised the official investigation into the killings ‘ we identified them because they were sat in the position that we would sit in if we were doing the same job			1
’ he added : ‘ we were told that they were probably ex-special forces soldiers who would have a good knowledge of surveillance techniques			0
’ later that month , @entity2 was arrested and in february 2008 he was convicted of killing all five women and handed a whole - life sentence			1
despite the successful outcome , the former investigator was critical of the newspaper , which was closed last july after it emerged staff had hacked murdered schoolgirl @entity80 ’s phone			0
victims : @entity7 , 25 , and 19 - year - old @entity7 who were two of the five people killed by @entity2 in his witness statement , mr @entity12 wrote that ‘ many murderers revisit the scene of the crime ’ and if caught in the act by police surveillance , this can provide ‘ extremely important ’ evidence to the prosecution			1
‘ in this case , if the suspect had decided to re-visit the scene , to dispose of additional evidence , or to move a body that had not yet been found and he realised he was being followed , he may have cancelled or postponed his trip , ’ he said			0
‘ he would not care whether he was being followed by a “ legitimate ” surveillance team or one employed by a newspaper			0
the evidence would be lost and the prosecution case weakened			0
’ murder probe : forensic officers carry out an investigation into the death of one of the five prostitutes killed by @entity2 in 2006 @entity111 crime correspondent @entity110 , who is chairman of the @entity112 , said the @entity114 ’s decision to use a surveillance team to follow police was ‘ shocking ’			1
the inquiry also heard that the @entity118 used counter-surveillance techniques when it interviewed one of the suspects in the case			0
mr @entity12 said officers observed the man being ‘ picked up and driven round by a team that carried out anti-surveillance manoeuvres before dropping him off at a hotel to be interviewed ’ .			0
