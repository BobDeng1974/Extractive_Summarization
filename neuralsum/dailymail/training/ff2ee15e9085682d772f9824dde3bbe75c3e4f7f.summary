' i remember him telling me that @entity7 and @entity3 were very close			1
@entity3 on the set of @entity8 to meet @entity7			1
the film told the story of a prim missionary and a gruff adventurer , the captain of the african queen ' @entity3 had travelled out to see @entity7 and spent several weeks out there on location with their son			1
' my dad would always come back with lots of stories			0
' there were a few close encounters with crocodiles and hippopotamuses while filming the african queen but i understand they had a lot of fun and partied as best they could given the conditions			1
' it was quite treacherous			0
they were working in difficult conditions			0
there were people with rifles to protect the crew , actors and actresses			2
it was a jungle after all where there were things that could eat you			0
' actress @entity3 , who died on tuesday at the age of 89 , flew out to be near her husband @entity7 who played @entity21 in the african queen it was after hearing the news that @entity3 had died that @entity28 's son dug out the photo albums			1
' we knew she was out there with @entity7 but these photos have been tucked away for years			2
' @entity8 may have featured as a small part of @entity3 's life but her time with @entity7 was a major part of her life ' @entity28 got into photography by accident and started taking pictures with a cheap camera at a young age			1
' it blossomed from there ' , his son said			0
' in 1944 he was in @entity112 and was appointed combat photographer travelling throughout south east @entity114			0

if something crops up you get them out			0
in this case the death of @entity3 brought things back into focus			2
i wish i spoke to him a bit more about them now			0
' @entity3 was a movie star from almost her first moment on the silver screen			2
a fashion model and bit - part @entity46 actress before moving to @entity11 at 19 , @entity3 achieved immediate fame in 1944 with one scene in her first film , to have and have not			1
leaving @entity7 's hotel room , @entity3 — a lanky figure with flowing blond hair and a stunning face — murmured : ' you do n't have to say anything , and you do n't have to do anything			1
oh , maybe just whistle			0
you know how to whistle , do n't you , @entity155 ? you just put your lips together and blow			0
' with that cool , sultry come - on , not only was a star born , but the beginning of a legend , her title burnished over the years with pivotal roles , signature @entity46 wit , and a marriage to @entity7 that accounted for one of the most famous @entity11 couples of all time			1
the @entity169 nominated actress received two @entity171 , an honorary @entity169 and scores of film and tv roles			0
but , to her occasional frustration , she was remembered for her years with @entity7 and treated more as a star by the film industry than as an actress			1
@entity3 would outlive her husband by more than 50 years , but never outlive their iconic status			1
they were ' @entity7 and @entity3 ' — the hard - boiled couple who could fight and make up with the best of them			1
she was less than half @entity7 's age , yet as wise , and as jaded as he was			2
they starred in movies @entity190 and @entity191 together , threw all - night parties , palled around with @entity193 and others and formed a gang of @entity197 carousers known as the @entity198 , which @entity193 would resurrect after @entity7 's death			2

as a young woman , @entity221 , the famed editor of @entity222 , thought she was ideal for fashion modeling , and @entity3 appeared regularly in the magazine			2
the wife of film director @entity227 saw her on a magazine cover and recommended her as film material , and she went to @entity11 under a contract			0
hawks became her mentor , coaching her on film acting and introducing her to @entity11 society			0
he was preparing a movie to star @entity7 , based on an @entity239 story , ' to have and have not , ' with a script partly written by @entity241			2
by this time she had acquired the professional name of @entity3 , though @entity7 and all her friends continued to call her @entity3			1
in @entity244 , she wrote of meeting @entity7 : ' there was no thunderbolt , no clap of thunder , just a simple how - do - you - do			2
' @entity3 was best known for acting opposite her husband , @entity7 , in several 1940s classics including @entity252 , @entity190 and @entity191 on her first day of shooting , her hands were shaking so much that she could n't manage a simple scene of lighting a cigarette			1
the 23 - year age difference ( he called her " baby " ) failed to deter them , but they faced a serious obstacle : @entity7 was still married to the mercurial actress @entity265 , with whom he engaged in much - publicised alcoholic battles			1
she was persuaded to divorce him , and the lovers were married on may 21 , 1945			0

she also became active politically , joining her husband in protesting the @entity11 blacklist of suspected communists and campaigning for @entity279			0
few could forget the picture of her slouched on top of a piano , long legs dangling , while @entity284 — then vice president — was seated in front of the keys			0
but the party began to wind down in march 1956 , when @entity7 was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus			2
