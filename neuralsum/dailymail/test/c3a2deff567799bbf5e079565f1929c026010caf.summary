@entity0 has been accused of stooping to a ' shameful ' new low by blaming @entity2 for the @entity4 refugee crisis			1
the @entity6 leader used a keynote campaign speech today to suggest the deaths of hundreds of refugees fleeing @entity10 could have been avoided if the prime minister had done more following his intervention in @entity13 to remove the former dictator @entity14			1
in a briefing note sent out before the speech , @entity6 went further - claiming the crisis was ' in part a direct result ' of mr @entity2 's foreign policy			1
the allegation provoked a furious response from the @entity23 who this morning demanded that mr @entity0 apologise for the ' outrageous and disgraceful ' remarks			1
the prime minister announced the deployment of one of @entity43 's biggest warships - @entity41 - as part of beefed - up efforts to prevent more refugees packing onto tiny boats			1
up to 1,750 refugees have lost their lives trying to reach @entity50 this year - out of around 35,000 who have tried to make the crossing			0
the vast majority of the migrant boats set off from the @entity13 , which has descended into chaos in the aftermath of the 2011 revolution which saw @entity14 swept from power with the support of @entity60 and @entity43			1
over 200 illegal migrants were rescued by @entity65 @entity64 boat ' @entity62 ' in the @entity4 this week the refugees will be shipped to the @entity65 mainland after being rescued by @entity65 coast guards mr @entity0 today accused the prime minister of taking his eye off the ball by failing to secure a stable transfer of power in the wake of the uprising			1
the @entity6 leader said this failure had contributed to the crisis today			2
but the suggestion sparked a furious response from the prime minister today			1
mr @entity2 said : ' let me be clear about what @entity0 has said			1
i have learned as prime minister that it is so important in a dangerous and uncertain world that you show clarity , consistency and strength on these foreign policy issues			1
' people will look at these ill - judged remarks and they will reach their own conclusions			0
' former foreign secretary @entity30 slammed the ' ill - judged , opportunistic remarks '			0
he said : ' foreign policy is not something that you can just discover 13 days before polling day			0
' this is the first time in five years that @entity0 has troubled himself to make a full length speech on foreign policy			2
' environment secretary @entity101 said mr @entity0 should withdraw the ' outrageous and disgraceful ' remarks			2
' accusing the prime minister of causing these deaths - whether directly or indirectly - i think is wrong , ' she told @entity106 's today			1
' @entity0 feels like he 's losing the argument and he 's lashing out			2
of course we should be talking about foreign affairs but it has to be done in a proper manner			0
' seek and destroy : @entity43 will send one of its biggest warships , @entity114 ( above ) , to the @entity4 within days as part of plans to targets boats used by human traffickers @entity2 held high - level talks with @entity65 prime minister @entity120 ( left ) , @entity122 chancellor @entity121 ( top left ) and @entity60 president @entity123 ( top right ) at a @entity35 summit yesterday a senior @entity127 source added : ' this takes @entity6 's relentless negative campaigning to a new low			1
' the source pointed out that mr @entity0 had supported the intervention in @entity13 which he now blamed for causing the crisis			1
@entity133 said the @entity6 attack was a ' distasteful ' attempt to make political capital from the @entity4 refugee crisis			2
mr @entity133 insisted that ' a considerable amount of thought went in by the international community ' to the aftermath and ' a huge amount of help and assistance and money has gone into trying to do our bit from outside '			2
he acknowledged that it was ' legitimate to say that things then spiral in directions that you ca n't fully predict '			0
' all i would plead for is a little less finger - pointing wisdom from @entity0 - when he supported the intervention in the first place - and a little bit more adherence to facts about exactly who is ending up on these boats , why they are and what we can now do about it to stop this terrible tragedy , ' he said			2
mr @entity2 was given a rapturous reception in @entity167 in september 2011 after flying into the capital following the @entity170 bombing campaign which allowed rebels to overthrow @entity14 @entity13 rebels overthrew the country 's dictator @entity14 ( right ) with the support of @entity43 , @entity60 and @entity177 airstrikes but the shadow foreign secretary @entity179 defended mr @entity0 's attack – and insisted the prime minister had failed to plan for the aftermath of @entity14 's downfall			1
he said : ' it is a failure of post-conflict planning for which the international community bears responsibility			0
that 's not a matter of dispute , it 's a matter of fact			0
' in his speech to the @entity27 think tank today , mr @entity0 said : ' the tragedy is that this could have been anticipated			2
' since the action , the failure of post-conflict planning has become obvious			0
@entity2 was wrong to assume that @entity13 's political culture and institutions could be left to evolve and transform on their own			1
' it should have been avoided			0
and @entity43 could have played its part in ensuring the international community stood by the people of @entity13 in practice rather than standing behind the unfounded hopes of potential progress only in principle			0
' in march 2011 @entity6 and @entity127 @entity209 united to back military action against @entity13 to stop @entity14 committing a ‘ bloody massacre ’			2
the country ’s then dictator had threatened to slaughter his own people to cling on to power after a rebel uprising in the east of the country			0
the commons vote came after the @entity220 passed a motion giving @entity43 , @entity60 and the @entity177 the authority to use ‘ all necessary measures ’ to protect @entity13 civilians			2
labour leader @entity0 said he supported the action , arguing it was " a just cause , with a feasible mission , and it has international support "			1
less than six months later , in november 2011 , after @entity230 bombing raids allowed @entity13 ’s rebel forces to sweep the @entity14 regime from power , mr @entity2 and @entity234 flew into @entity167			1
it was the first visit by @entity230 leaders since the dictator 42 - year - rule had come to an end			0
mr @entity2 praised the @entity13 fighters as ‘ lions ’ and described their revolt as the moment ‘ when the @entity243 could become an @entity245 summer ’ in which ‘ we see democracy advance in other countries too ’			1
but in the three years since @entity14 was toppled , the country has descended into chaos			0
there has been no effective government since the 2011 uprising			0
instead , there are hundreds of different armed groups fighting for territory and influence			0
it currently has two rival governments , one based in the capital , @entity167 , and the other based hundreds of miles away in the port of @entity262			0
people smugglers are taking advantage of the subsequent chaos and confusion tearing the country apart to ply their trade with little to no threat of being caught			0
with @entity270 also having established strongholds in the towns on @entity273 and @entity274 , and with smaller bases elsewhere in the country , fear of capture and execution at the hands of the radical @entity281 is driving the desperate migrants to leave @entity13 as quickly as they can , dangerously overloading vessels .			0
