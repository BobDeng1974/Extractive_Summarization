a mother has not eaten a meal for seven years due to a rare condition which left her stomach paralysed			1
@entity4 , 25 , from @entity5 , was struck down by a ' mild case of man flu ' in 2008			1
she has not been able to keep any food or drink down since and vomited up to 50 times every day			1
initially doctors believed she had an eating disorder , before finally diagnosing her with gastroparesis			2
this is a condition in which the stomach muscles are paralysed , meaning food is not emptied properly			1
she unable to eat anything at her wedding to it worker @entity28 , 27 , and has been told she will never eat again			2
mrs @entity4 said : ' i ca n't really stress just how mild this flu was - i called it man flu			1
' my mum had flu at the same time but mine was only slightly different			2
' but once i started vomiting , it is crippling pain and i have n't really stopped vomiting since			1
' we always say that you take eating and drinking for granted until you ca n't do it			2
' i still cook the kid 's teas and it smells and looks great but if i even had a bite then i 'd be in crippling pain			0
' the mother - of - two ' miracle ' children was forced to jack in her new admin job after just three months to battle the debilitating illness			2
her weight plummeted from nine stone to just seven and her attempts to regain weight by eating food caused her to regurgitate anything she consumed			0
gastroparesis is a chronic condition in which the stomach is unable to empty in the normal way			1
symptoms including feeling sick and vomiting when eating , bloating , loss of appetite and weight loss			2
the problem is thought to be caused by a problem with the nerves or muscles controlling the emptying of the stomach			1
in many cases , the cause of this nerve damage is unknown but it can also be caused by poorly controlled diabetes			0
other possible causes include parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis and some medications			0
the condition can not be cured but it can usually be controlled			0
some people are able to manage the condition by changing their diet , for example by eating six small meals a day or by sticking to soft , easily digestible foods			2
in some cases , symptoms can be improved with medication but other people require injections of @entity100 into the valve between their stomach and small intestine			2
if all of these options fail , a patient can have a new procedure which involves fitting a pacemaker device to encourage the stomach to process food			2
if none of these options succeed in making the stomach process food , the patient will have to be fed through a tube			1
source : @entity117 the condition meant at her wedding she could only look on as guests lapped up a feast of duck , beef and a rich chocolate cake for dessert			0
mrs @entity4 said : ' imagine being sat at the top table at your wedding watching everyone tuck in to the wedding cake that you made and you ca n't have any			1
' it was the same with the wedding breakfast and i just had to hold the glass of champagne for the toast , i could n't even have a sip			0
' of course , it was a magical day but it was so difficult			0
' mrs @entity4 ' problems began when she was 18			1
her stomach stopped working after a bout of flu two years earlier , leaving her unable to keep any food or liquid down			1
she would vomit up to 50 times a day , but doctors suspected she had an eating disorder			1
finally , in 2008 mrs @entity4 was diagnosed with gastroparesis , a condition in which there is a problem with nerves or stomach muscles , meaning it does not empty itself of food properly			1
it is caused by damage to the vagus nerve , which regulates the digestive system			0
when this nerve is damaged , the muscles in the stomach and intestines stop working , preventing food from moving through the digestive system properly			1
it is usually cause by diabetes , @entity168 's or as a complication of surgery , but sometimes there is no clear cause and sufferers report they after coming down with flu , a virus , food poisoning or after taking antibiotics			0
mrs @entity4 was fitted with a gastro pacemaker , a metal device fitted in the abdomen to transmit electrical signals to the stomach muscles to get them working again			1
but the emergency measure failed and she suffered intestinal failure , where her bowel could not digest the foods and absorb the fluids necessary for her to live			1
she has to be fed directly into her bloodstream with total parenteral nutrition ( @entity193 ) - a specially made three - litre bag and pump that gives her nutrients for 12 hours every night			0
she has a food bag two days a week and a glucose bag five days a week , which both have to be stored between two and eight degrees			0
mrs @entity4 was struck down with mild flu in 2008 , and after this vomited up to 50 times a day			1
she was unable to eat any of the food on her wedding day to partner @entity28 , an it worker a side effect of being fed through a tube is that mrs @entity4 ' hair became thin and fell out , something she finds difficult mrs @entity4 said : ' it has a real impact on your life because you ca n't make any last - minute decisions - everything has to be planned months in advance ' ' you have to have the bag delivered there , the bag has to be stored in a fridge between two and eight degrees , everything has to be deep cleaned - sometimes it just really is n't worth it			1
' ' it 's funny because it really restricts your life but , obviously , i would n't be here without it so it gives me life too			0
' the illness has left mrs @entity4 wheelchair - bound and she has had to watch her hair fall out , something she has found very difficult			1
she said : ' a side effect of the @entity193 is that your hair can get very thin and fall out			0
' my hair came out in clumps and i lost the majority of it and poor @entity24 said it scared him , which broke my heart , so @entity28 chopped off all my long hair			0
' it 's awful for a woman to have to go through that - but after he did mine , he shaved his hair off too in support			0
' he joked and said he did n't want me to wake up the next day and be the only baldie in the family			2
' and she was consigned to hospital for three months after becoming seriously ill with sepsis in september last year			0
despite the chronic illness , she has managed to give birth to son @entity24 , three , and 11 - month - old daughter @entity25			0
the two children were both born healthy despite their mother being unable to eat for two			1
mrs @entity4 said : ' i call them my two miracle babies - @entity24 was fed off my old tube and @entity25 was fed by @entity193			1
mrs @entity4 knows she will never eat ' real food ' again , and her weight dropped from 9st to 7st ' @entity24 knows it 's different and will always say as soon as we meet anyway " my mummy is fed by a tube " , which really breaks the ice			1
' @entity267 is just coming up to the age where she keeps grabbing the tube and that 's not too helpful			0
' she adds that she feels ' luckier than most ' because she was able to have children , and receives support from her family and from @entity24 's school			2
she said : ' we always say that someone else is always worse off			0
i 'm lucky that i have two beautiful children despite my problem			0
' @entity24 's school is great			0
i have only managed to do one school run since he started in september because i was too poorly and could n't go in			2
' but the staff at the nursery have been fantastic - they take photocopies of the work he does in the day and photos of him in class and they send them to me so i can keep up with what he gets up to , so even though i am not always with it , i have snippets in my mind			0
â€˜ on days i feel like i ca n't take it anymore , seeing his face lit up is all i need to keep going			0
