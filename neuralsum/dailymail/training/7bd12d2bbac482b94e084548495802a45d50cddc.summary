speaker : @entity1 was a paramedic who essentially became a spokesperson for the town of @entity2 after last month 's deadly explosion at a fertilizer facility charged : @entity1 , a first responder at the fertilizer plant blast in @entity2 , @entity4 , is facing a charge of possession of a destructive device still , @entity1 's arrest was drawing attention in part because in the days following the blast , @entity1 did n't shy away from media attention in @entity2			1

' clearup : students clean debris at a home in @entity2 , @entity4 , that was damaged due to the explosion			1
the blast caused tens of millions of dollars in damage to the surrounding area fatalities : among the 14 people killed were 10 emergency responders on friday afternoon in @entity2 , several of @entity1 's neighbors stood outside near his red brick duplex , a neighborhood less than a mile from the plant where some homes ' windows remained boarded			1

' however , in a profile , the @entity123 found other inconsistencies in @entity1 ’s self - portrayal , including degrees listed on his resume that it appears he never actually completed			1
residents began to have more serious questions about @entity1 after it appeared he had woven different stories to different people about what had happened , and alternately telling people he was a police officer and a government representative			2
the paper surmises that it is hard to know what is true and what is fabrication when it comes to @entity1			2
