planes that travel faster than the speed of sound using radical ' hybrid wing body ' designs could be the future of travel , according to concepts developed by @entity7			1
the @entity9 space agency has been working with manufacturers to design the next generation of planes that will make travelling around the world faster and more fuel efficient			2
its archive of designs reveals just how different planes may appear in as little as ten years , with radical designs featuring needle - like bodies , sleek fuselages and delta wings			1
this computer - generated image shows a possible future ' flying wing ' aircraft in flight over populated areas			2
this kind of design , produced by @entity30 , would most likely carry cargo and then also carry passengers			0
@entity7 says something like this could be in service in 2025 one of the most popular designs is something called the ' hybrid wing body , ' which is sometimes described as a blended wing body , according to a report in @entity40			1
in this design , the wing blends seamlessly into the body of the aircraft , which makes it extremely aerodynamic and creates dramatic cuts in fuel consumption , noise and emissions			2
in 2012 , @entity7 successfully tested the @entity49 - a ' hybrid wing - body ' plane with a greater internal volume for passengers and cargo			1
the triangle - shaped plane is reminiscent of spy planes and designed to cut through the air more efficiently			0
with a 21 ft ( 6.54 metre ) wingspan , the aircraft was an 8.5 per cent scale model of a heavy - lift , subsonic airplane with a 240 - foot wingspan that could be developed in the next 15 to 20 years for military applications			2
our ability to fly at supersonic speeds over land in civil aircraft depends on the ability to reduce the level of sonic booms			2
@entity7 has been exploring a variety of options for quieting the boom , starting with design concepts and moving through wind tunnel tests to flight tests of new technologies			2
this rendering of a possible future civil supersonic transport shows a vehicle that is shaped to reduce the sonic shockwave the ' double bubble ' @entity86 future aircraft design concept comes from the research team led by the @entity88			1
based on a modified tube and wing with a very wide fuselage to provide extra lift , its low sweep wing reduces drag and weight ; the embedded engines sit aft of the wings			1
the @entity101 aircraft would be used for domestic flights and has been designed with a 2030 - 2035 timeframe this is radically different to the ' double bubble ' @entity86 future aircraft design concept which comes from a research team led by the @entity88			1
based on a modified tube and wing with a very wide fuselage to provide extra lift , its low sweep wing reduces drag and weight ; the embedded engines sit aft of the wings			1
' the idea there is to take some of the lift that you would normally get from the wings and try and move that to the fuselage , ' said @entity118 , a research at @entity7 's @entity120			1
' another thing that 's done to enable laminar flow on this vehicle is to reduce the sweep of the wings			2
it is easier to maintain laminar flow if the wings , instead of being swept back like a lot of modern commercial transports , are more sort of perpendicular to the side of the body of the plane			2
@entity133 could be superseded by something even faster			0
@entity135 2.5 is about the speed limit for gas - turbine engines			0
any faster and the temperature and pressure of air entering the engine is too high for the turbo machinery inside			0
to fly at hypersonic speed - @entity143 and above - requires a different type of engine			0
a supersonic - combustion ramjet , or scramjet , has no moving parts			0
instead of the rotating compressor and turbine in a jet engine , air is compressed and expanded by complex systems of shockwaves under the front of the aircraft , inside the inlet and under the fuselage at the rear			0
scramjets have been under development for decades , but a breakthrough came in may 2013 , when the @entity165 ’s @entity164 flew for 240 seconds over the @entity166 on scramjet power , reaching @entity168 and running until its fuel was exhausted			0
the next step is to build a high - speed cruise missile , able to strike distant targets in minutes , not hours			0
@entity175 ’s @entity174 - builder of the @entity178 @entity177 spyplane - has unveiled plans to develop a successor , dubbed the @entity181			0
designed for reconnaissance and strike missions , the @entity181 would combine turbojet and ramjet / scramjet engines to enable the aircraft to take off from a runway , accelerate to a @entity190 cruise , and then return to a conventional runway landing			0
if it can secure funding from the @entity193 , @entity175 believes a prototype could be flying as soon as 2023 and the @entity181 could enter service by 2030 , potentially paving the way for commercial applications of scramjet technology			0
this future aircraft design concept comes from the research team led by @entity201			1
much lighter and more aerodynamic than current aircraft with the same capacity , the 20 - passenger aircraft would reduce fuel consumption and noise and enable business jet - like travel between more than 1,300 airports			2
it features ultra-quiet turboprop engines and virtual reality windows the ' @entity214 ' future aircraft design concept for supersonic flight over land was created by @entity164 with the help of @entity7			1
its design is meant to save fuel			0
it also achieves large reductions in sonic boom noise levels that will meet the target level required to make supersonic flight over land possible this idea for a possible future aircraft is called a ' hybrid wing body ' or sometimes a blended wing body			1
in this design , the wing blends seamlessly into the body of the aircraft , which makes it extremely aerodynamic and holds great promise for dramatic reductions in fuel consumption , noise and emissions aeronautics engineers are also working to define a new standard for low sonic booms			1
they have been busy gathering data in order to create new , quieter planes that could help overturn the current ban on supersonic flight over land			0
‘ lessening sonic booms - shock waves caused by an aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound - is the most significant hurdle to reintroducing commercial supersonic flight , ’ said @entity247 , head of the @entity248 in @entity7 ’s @entity249 , @entity250			1
‘ other barriers include high altitude emissions , fuel efficiency and community noise around airports			0
’ ' we are nowhere near the maximum that we can get out of this industry , ' added @entity7 engineer @entity264			0
' there is a lot of work to do			0
' this artist 's concept shows a possible future subsonic aircraft using a boxed - or joined - wing configuration to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency			1
this design of an aircraft that could enter service in the 2020 timeframe @entity164 's advanced vehicle concept centers around the familiar blended wing body design like the @entity49			1
what makes this design different is the placement of its @entity283 geared turbofan engines on the top of the plane 's back end , flanked by two vertical tails to shield people on the ground from engine noise the @entity292 , or @entity293 , future aircraft design comes from the research team led by @entity297 conventional - looking , the concept features advanced lightweight ceramic composite materials and nanotechnology and shape memory alloys			1

@entity7 's archive of future aircraft concept designs feature needle - like bodies , sleek fuselages and delta wings
one of the most popular designs is something called the ' hybrid wing body ' which **improve*s* aerodynamics
*similarly* , the ' double bubble ' @entity86 future aircraft design uses a very wide fuselage to provide extra lift
aeronautics engineers are also working to define a new standard for sonic booms to *improve* travel speed
