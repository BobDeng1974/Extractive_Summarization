@entity0 's is set to revolutionise how we do our weekly shop by letting us scan items in our home as they run out			1
its latest app lets homeowners gradually build up a list of items they need over the course of a week or fortnight , for example			1
and when that shopper enters a local store , a map will appear on the phone showing the customer where their groceries are to save them time trawling the aisles			1
the @entity0 's app is in development and will be trialled in @entity22 later this year			1
as customers scan their household items , a live pricing tool will show their list with current store prices			1
these prices will update automatically if an item goes on sale			2
the current @entity32 app is pictured the app is currently in development and will be trialled at a store in @entity22 later this year			1
as customers scan their household items , a live pricing tool will show their list with current store prices			1
these prices will update automatically if an item goes on sale , or becomes part of a multi-buy deal for example			0
the map appears on the app when the registered phone joins a store 's @entity48 network			1
it will help shoppers plot the best route to take through the store to get all of the items they need , and will highlight any that are out of stock where appropriate			2
and for any additional items that the shopper does n't have at home , they can use the app to scan barcodes while in the store			1
the app is an extension of @entity0 's current @entity66 ( pictured ) , which lets customers scan items on their phone as they journey around the store			1
card details are stored securely on the app and payments can be made as soon as they have finished shopping and want to leave the store sensors embedded in the wheels of shopping trolleys could tell retailers a shopper ’s location in real - time			2
this data could be used to manage queues and guide people to special offers			0
the device fits invisibly into the wheel of a trolley and is fitted with with sensors and bluetooth connection			0
it was invented by product design firm @entity91			0
it tells retailers a shopper ’s location to within 3ft ( one metre ) and does n’t need batteries because it harvests energy from the rotation of the wheel to power the technology			0
data is transmitted via @entity104 to a shop ’s server , meaning the system would be relatively cheap to put in place			0
the technology may spell the end of queues because it could be used to alert staff when customers are nearing checkouts , allowing shops to automatically allocate assistants when they are needed most			0
it could also point consumers in the right direction to find special offers			0
the app is an extension of @entity0 's current @entity32 scheme , which lets customers scan items on their phone as they journey around the store			1
card details are stored securely on the app and payments can be made as soon as they have finished shopping and want to leave the store			2
a receipt is generated automatically			0
to avoid shoplifting , @entity0 's said it will set up so - called ' payment zones ' that will ask customers to scan a qr code , ensuring shoppers pay for their goods			2
the phone will also potentially be able to tell when a customer has left the store and has n't paid using beacons			2
@entity32 is being trialled at the @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity147 stores and is only open to @entity149 card holders			0
if the @entity22 trial of the new app is successful , the app is expected to be rolled out next year			1
@entity0 's boss @entity153 told @entity154 : ' the mobile scan and go technology will end up being adopted across the industry			0
' i think where we can win is with our customer interaction , offering them alternative products because they suit their lifestyle for example			0
over time we can do a better job of that			0

app is in development and will be trialled in @entity22 later this year
