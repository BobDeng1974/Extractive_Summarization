a nine - month ordeal ended for @entity6 , 54 , and son @entity7 , 26 , yesterday when a judge threw out the case against them			1
they had begged police to go on a roof to arrest career criminal @entity14			1
appeal : @entity6 , 54 and @entity17 , 26 begged police to arrest @entity14 when he was caught burgling their scrap yard in @entity20 but officers were barred by their superiors , via their radio , due to health and safety rules			1
eventually , the father and son , both former soldiers , went on the roof themselves to tackle the armed man			1
they were stunned when the police later arrested them on suspicion of attempted murder – and later charged them with the lesser offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent			1
yesterday , the pair said they were considering legal action against @entity41			2
mr @entity42 said he had suffered a heart attack in a cell triggered by the stress of his arrest at their scrap metal business in @entity20 , @entity49 , last december			1
he added : ‘ we had suffered a string of burglaries and went up onto that roof only because the police had refused to do so			1
’ the men were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after tackling the man , hitting him once on the chest and hand in an attempt to restrain him he said he grabbed @entity14 by the shoulder and ‘ walloped ’ him once to the chest to restrain him , while his son admitted striking the intruder on the hand with a wooden roof baton to try to dislodge an eight - inch metal roof bolt from his grasp			2
@entity70 and @entity17 's case was thrown out of court			2
police were not allowed to intervene in the burglary because of health and safety rules mr @entity6 junior is said to have struck the suspect again before the pair managed to drag him off the roof and down a ladder to police			1
but a pc waiting on the ground claimed to have seen them carry out a ferocious assault			0

he was sentenced to 26 weeks in jail and deported for a second time on his release in march this year			2
the @entity95 ’ trial had been for the judge to consider a defence application to throw the case out as an ‘ abuse of the court process ’			0
the application hinged on a decision by the @entity111 to refuse permission for @entity14 to be returned to the @entity92 to give evidence because he was a ‘ flight risk ’ – having been deported twice – and might disappear in the @entity92			0
