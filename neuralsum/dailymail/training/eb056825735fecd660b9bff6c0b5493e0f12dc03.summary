by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 19:35 est , 28 january 2014 a couple came within 48 hours of losing their grand - daughter forever after social workers put her up for adoption			1
@entity7 and @entity8 told how social workers , operating behind the cover of the notoriously secretive family courts , were ‘ hell - bent ’ on handing the baby to strangers			1
in an extraordinary ruling , in which they were denied guardianship of the then three - month - old , they were also excluded from all future proceedings while the adoption went ahead			1
forced adoption : now two years old , @entity20 was almost taken away from her grandparents @entity22 and @entity7 ( pictured ) despite them offering her a loving home			2
they claim social workers were ' hell - bent ' on giving her away prejudice : the @entity29 claim social workers made ' assumptions ' about their working - class family because they had seven children , six of whom lived at home , saying their grandchild would ' become lost ' among them			1
they were granted a last - minute reprieve only after they discovered they had a 14 - day window to appeal			1
the @entity29 claim social workers made ‘ assumptions ’ about their working - class family because they had seven children – six of whom lived at home – commenting that their grandchild , @entity41 , would ‘ become lost ’ among them			1
mrs @entity8 , 39 , said : ‘ social services walked into our lives with preconceptions and did not have any intention of revising those prejudices			1
‘ we are not a conventional family , some of our children have been home - schooled , and i do n’t think they liked that			1
‘ but we knew we were capable of giving @entity41 a loving home			0
too big ? @entity41 ( far left ) with five of the couple 's seven children , which social workers said was too many to give her a loving home - from left , @entity59 ( nine ) , honey ( five ) , @entity61 ( 13 ) , @entity62 ( 11 ) and @entity63 ( five ) loving : @entity41 ( centre ) with , from left , her new siblings @entity63 , honey , @entity69 , @entity62 and @entity59 ‘ they never intended to take the time to get to know us or the children			1
’ the couple can only now finally tell their story after the judge released his judgment , more than 13 months later			0
in the ruling , made in november 2012 , judge @entity78 said he was ‘ deeply troubled by what occurred ’ and criticised the ‘ manifestly unjust ’ decision by @entity81 to exclude the ‘ interested and committed grandparents ’			1
he said by denying the couple the right to a fair hearing , the council had breached their human rights			0
anger : the couple only realised they could appeal the ruling with days to spare the @entity29 , who live in @entity94 , were given full custody of @entity41 , now two , the daughter of their eldest child , last august			2
former retail manager mr @entity98 , 40 , said : ‘ we nearly lost our granddaughter to strangers because social services were hell - bent on having @entity41 adopted , but we were unable to talk about it because it happened in secret			2
‘ there is a misconception grandparents have automatic rights , but they do n’t			0
‘ social services have too much power and the secret courts assist them to behave in any way they wish , because there is no recourse			2
there is no one to scrutinise their decisions			0
’ the couple ’s story has emerged in the same month @entity123 , @entity124 of the @entity125 , announced that future judgments in the family courts and the @entity128 must be made public except where there is a clear reason why not			0
it follows a series of major scandals exposed by the @entity136 over the past year in which justice was conducted behind closed doors			0
@entity41 was taken into care in february 2012 when her 19 - year - old single mother suffered mental health problems			1
when the @entity144 belatedly discovered this , they applied for guardianship			0
but assessments by social workers at their home in april and july that year raised ‘ anxieties ’ about the @entity29 , including that their family was too large			1
in october 2012 , social services told the court it intended to find a ‘ permanent secure placement away from the birth family ’ for @entity41			2
they refused the @entity29 ’ application , citing ‘ chaotic and hectic living arrangements and the current physical limitations that the [ @entity144 ’ ] house represents ’			0
family : without time to assemble a legal argument , the couple appealed with no lawyers to help - and won but they went even further , dismissing the @entity29 from all future proceedings after claiming there was ‘ no further role for them ’			2
plans were made for @entity41 ’s adoption , but the @entity29 discovered the 14 - day window to appeal			2
they were , however , on day ten			0
with no legal representation or legal aid , they appealed two days before the deadline			0
judge @entity78 immediately quashed the previous ruling			2
in his judgment , he said : ‘ this court is dismayed by what occurred			0
it was manifestly unjust , not just to the grandparents but to [ @entity41 ] and could in no way be thought to be @entity183 [ @entity183 ] compliant			1
‘ we are dealing with interested and committed grandparents and the law could not be clearer			0
’ the @entity29 have seven children , aged 21 to five , but say it is ‘ insulting ’ for social workers to suggest they received less love or attention than an only child			1
the couple already take their children to ballet and drama classes , with some appearing in adverts and films they take their youngest to ballet and drama classes every week and five of their children , @entity69 , 13 , @entity62 , 11 , @entity59 , nine , and five - year - old twins @entity201 and @entity202 have appeared in adverts and even @entity205 films , including @entity206 , starring @entity207			0
@entity41 has now settled into her grandparents ’ four - bedroom semi-detached house and sees her mother , now 21 , once a month			0
mrs @entity8 said : ‘ losing @entity41 would have been as close to a bereavement as you can get			1
’ an @entity81 spokesman said : ‘ this case involved very complex and finely balanced decisions ... as the case progressed , the council was able to change its position to support the grandparents			0
’ the @entity29 deny that @entity81 ever switched its support in their favour			0
the council is already embroiled in another high - profile family court row , after @entity224 , a 35 - year - old @entity225 , was forced to undergo a caesarean by the secretive @entity128 , so her baby could be taken into care .			1

baby girl was taken into care because of her mother 's mental health issues
@entity7 and @entity8 applied for custody but were refused
@entity81 claimed their family of seven children was too big
so social workers barred them from secret court proceedings
judge *overturned* the ' manifestly unjust ' ruling after a last - minute appeal
mrs @entity8 , 39 : ' we are not conventional , and i do n’t think they liked that '
