by @entity0 published : 08:08 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 05:24 est , 9 january 2013 it landed in a blaze of jets that scorched the martian surface , has burnt holes in rocks and scooped up soil before messily dumping it			0
now @entity10 's @entity9 finally seems to be making amends - and acting uncannily like @entity13 's wall - e cleaning robot - by sweeping nearby rocks clean			2
the latest part of its mission saw the rover use specially designed brushes ( or dirt removal tools , as the space agency calls them ) to reveal nearby rocks scientists were interested in			1
one of the areas ' dusted ' by @entity9 using its wire brush @entity25 , the @entity13 robot which was designed to clear @entity27 the rotating wire bristles cleared a roughly 5cm - wide patch on an area of ground dubbed ' @entity32 ' by scientists			1
brushing away the dust gives the robot 's survey instruments a clearer view of the texture and chemistry of the underlying rock			2
the tool is a motorized , wire - bristle brush on the turret at the end of the rover 's arm			1
the rover is currently investigating a location in @entity50 ' @entity49 known as @entity51 , a small depression several hundred metres from the point where it landed back in august , where scientists were interested in rock patterns			0
' we wanted to be sure we had an optimal target for the first use [ of the dust removal tool ] , " said @entity58 from @entity10 's @entity59			1
an area brushed by the rover to reveal the underlying ground , which includes white particles ' we need to place the instrument within less than half an inch of the target without putting the hardware at risk			0
' we needed a flat target , one that was n't rough , one that was covered with dust			0
' the results certainly look good			0
' @entity9 is still yet to use its hammer - drill , the last major tool yet to be deployed on the mission			2
it it hopes that by brishing rocks , researchers can find a rock suitable for drilling			0
the wire brush bristles can be seen on the right on the image , extending from the rover 's robotic arm the ' dirt removal tool ' - or wire brush , is one of @entity9 's several tools .			1

@entity10 uses ' dirt removal tool ' - also known as a wire brush , to sweep dust for first time
only the rover 's drill remains *unused*
