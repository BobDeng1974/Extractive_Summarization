by @entity0 a company boss has slammed the government 's @entity3 service after his ad for a personal assistant who could ' speak excellent @entity7 ' was queried because it could breach the @entity9			1
@entity10 , who runs a communications firm called @entity12 based in @entity13 , south @entity14 , said he tried to place the ad on the government 's @entity3 website last week			2
but rather than the job being listed on the site - which has hundreds of thousands of jobs around the @entity21 - mr @entity10 received a response questioning his requirement			1
communications firm boss @entity10 has been left angry by claims by a government - run website that his requirement a @entity28 ' speak excellent @entity7 ' could breach the @entity9 after he asked for an ad stating that the successful candidate should ' speak excellent @entity7 ' , he was sent an email asking ' why the applicant needed to speak a particular language '			1
the site - run on behalf of the @entity34 - said a ' justification ' would be needed for exempting the ad from the @entity9 , passed to protect against discrimination			1
mr @entity10 said he was ' stunned ' by their query , which he branded ' a ridiculous example of politically correct red tape '			1
he said : ' we want a personal assistant and said in the advert we wanted someone with good communication skills , experience as a @entity28 and that they speak excellent @entity7			1
' when i heard back from @entity3 they told me that in order to comply with the @entity9 i would need to explain why the successful candidate would need a good command of @entity54			2
' it 's political correctness at its worst - there are thousands of small businesses out there who would benefit from this site , but if they are met with these sorts of questions and barriers it 's not really worth the effort			0
' the @entity34 has admitted its checks may have been too strict in this case mr @entity10 has now withdrawn the ad from @entity3 and is advertising elsewhere for the £ 18,000 - £ 24,000 job			1
the @entity9 is designed to stop employers discriminating against age , race , disability , religion and gender - but does not specify language			2
a spokesman for the @entity34 admitted that checks may have ' been too strict '			2
the @entity3 website has come under fire for a series of blunders in the past			0
among the jobs listed on the site previously was an ad for a hitman for @entity88 , which stated that an ' @entity88 target elimination specialist ' was needed			0
other ads included ' international couriers ' for @entity92 , also known as the @entity93 , as well as listings from pornographic websites			0
the jobs website - which replaced @entity97 - has also been slated for hundreds of thousands of repeat or fake job ads. he said : ' @entity101 is successfully helping people into work with around half a million employers now registered			0
' we have robust procedures in place to ensure that vacancies comply with equality legislation and that jobseekers are not discriminated against			0
' in this case , those checks may have been too strict and we are now reviewing our procedures			0
' the @entity3 website , launched in 2012 , aims to match jobs with jobseekers on a ' free job posting and matching service '			0
the site , set up by jobs firm monster at a cost to the @entity34 of £ 17m - and which costs £ 6m - a - year to run - has been criticised in the past after advertising for fake jobs .			1

@entity10 applied to advertise for @entity28 who ' speaks excellent @entity7 '
but government - run website said requirement could breach @entity9
@entity133 has hit out at the *decision* , branding it ' politically correct red tape '
the @entity34 , which is behind the site , has admitted check may be ' too strict '
