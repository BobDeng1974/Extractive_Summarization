facebook stalking : keeping an eye on the ex can stop you healing , a new study suggests before the internet made everyone just a click of the mouse away , the end of a relationship would often lead to a cutting of ties as both partners moved on with their lives			0
but @entity16 has disrupted the process , a new study claims , with newly - singles who stay friends with their exes on the social networking site struggling to recover emotionally when a relationship ends			1
researcher @entity25 , from @entity26 in @entity27 , suggests there is a lot of additional heartbreak in store for the third of us who keep an eye on the ex - or ' @entity16 - stalking ' , as some may call it			1
with 900 million @entity16 users in the world , it suggests a lot of broken hearts will take a time to mend			1
@entity43 asked 464 participants to evaluate their @entity16 usage , and estimated up to a third use @entity16 to check on the activities of former romantic partners			1
the study collected asked about each user 's emotional recovery and personal adjustment following the breakup of a romantic relationship			0
it evaluated parameters such as negative feelings , sexual desire and emotional longing for the ex-partner , and feelings of reduced personal growth as measures of distress and the ability to move forward with their lives			0
the study , entitled ' @entity68 of former romantic partners : associations with @entity73 and @entity74 ' , assessed the effects of continued @entity16 contact with an ex-partner and of @entity16 surveillance , in which there is no actual online contact , but one individual monitors the @entity16 page and postings of another			1
@entity84 , editor - in - chief of @entity85 at the @entity86 in @entity87 , said : ' this study sees again virtual life mirroring real life			0
just as real life contact with ex-partners may inhibit growth , healing , and well - being , so may virtual contact			0
' while @entity43 's study suggests a third of people ' stalk ' their exes , a study earlier this year by @entity98 at the @entity99 suggested up to 90 per cent of new singles would follow their ex on @entity16			2
comments left under your profile picture on @entity16 are one of the biggest indicators of your social status , according to a new study			2
researchers at the @entity115 say that the image we choose for our public persona , and what other people have to say about it underneath , strongly affects the level of the profile owner 's perceived attractiveness - physically , socially , and professionally			0
doctoral student @entity124 said that browsers , such as potential partners or employers , hold more weight by the comments left on your profile picture than any other part of your page - so your reputation is in the hands of those who leave a message			0
for anyone unfamiliar with the social network , @entity16 profile photos are the first photos visible on a user 's profile			2
other @entity16 users are able to post comments about each profile photo , which are visible to anyone who views the photo .			1

with 900 million @entity16 users in the world , a lot of broken hearts may take longer to heal
