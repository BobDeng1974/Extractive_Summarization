leaving a favourite dog in kennels while travelling abroad can be a source of profound guilt			2
but one owner was so overwhelmed with anxiety at the thought of being parted from her pet , she decided to take the dog on her frequent journeys overseas			1
as a result , may @entity13 ’s four - year - old cockapoo , miss @entity12 , has travelled the globe - visiting 11 countries and 23 destinations including @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
she takes more trips with her owner every year than the average @entity25 and has covered nearly 25,000 miles since 2011 - making her a real - life @entity26			1
the dogs have travelled on planes , trains , cars and ferries across the world and sleep in dog - friendly hotels with their 55 - year - old - owner			1
among the landmarks they have visited are the @entity31 , @entity18 ’s @entity56 and the @entity57			1
miss @entity12 , who took 12 trips with her owner last year alone , has become such a seasoned traveller she is familiar with boarding procedures at stations and airports			1
her interior designer owner said : ‘ over time and effort , travelling with @entity12 has become routine			1
‘ i know her ways and by now she ’s familiar with being in trains , waiting around in stations , boarding procedures for ferries and planes			2
she is a very calm dog			2
i am lucky that she is a very good traveller			2
boat trip : @entity12 with her owner @entity30 on board the @entity77 in the @entity78 returning from @entity18 ‘ my dogs are my best friends , my family – and i enjoy exploring places with them			1
having them with me makes me more relaxed during my holidays rather than thinking about them and worrying if they are okay			0
’ research from pet insurer @entity87 has found that 65 per cent of people experience separation anxiety from their pets when holidaying - something which miss @entity30 has struggled with			2
she tried leaving her dogs with friends , dog trainers and kennels but felt distressed by finding them unhappy and , on occasions , unwashed , on her return			2
miss @entity30 , from @entity99 , said : ‘ on occasions when i had left miss @entity12 behind with friends , she ’s constantly on the lookout for me when she was out walking			1
she was restless and listening out for me all the time , whining , which is out of character for her			0
‘ they may not necessarily appreciate the effort i go through to have them travel with me but i know they would rather be with me than not			0
’ before going abroad , miss @entity30 researches dog - friendly hotels and restaurants so she can eat and sleep with her dogs			1
she said : ‘ we ’ve travelled by rail , car , plane and ferry			2
being checked into cargo on a plane is not the most pleasant way for pets to get places			0
i would do so only if it is absolutely necessary in order to get my pets to where i will be if i am gone for long periods			0
globe - trotter : dressed up to visit @entity126 , @entity127 , left , and watching the sunset in @entity129 , right public transport : @entity12 is used to all forms of travel			1
pictured : on a train before arriving in @entity134 , @entity135 ‘ i am most concerned about their comfort level and have restricted our vacations to places where i can take them and where it is safe for them to go to			0
‘ there are obviously occasions where i need to travel further afield and that are not worth risking their safety to bring them along			0
’ @entity149 , @entity87 ’s pet behaviourist , said pet separation anxiety can be felt by both pet owners and their animals			0
she said : ‘ dogs are as social a species as we are , so it is not surprising that some dogs ca n’t cope with being left by themselves			0
‘ on the other hand , we know that cats are a solitary species and many like to spend time on their own - however , whilst most separation problems are usually seen in dogs , it does n’t mean that all cats are happy to accept being alone			0
‘ some can become over attached to their owners and also suffer from separation problems			0
‘ separation anxiety can vary in intensity , with signs including restlessness and panting , howling , destruction or messing			0
‘ knowing that 65 per cent of pet owners experience separation anxiety themselves when leaving their pets , with symptoms including uneasiness or restlessness , it ’s evident how much our pets mean to us			0
