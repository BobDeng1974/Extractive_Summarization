by @entity0 published : 04:24 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 04:35 est , 14 october 2013 bravery : @entity3 @entity2 risked his life to save his @entity6 co-workers an @entity3 banker risked his life to save his @entity6 colleagues just days before communist @entity10 guerrillas took control of @entity12			1
@entity2 rescued over 100 of his colleagues as terrifying rumours spread of a civilian massacre , by pretending they were his wives and children on evacuation forms			1
they now live prosperous lives as @entity3 citizens with children who are doctors and lawyers , and with grandchildren			1
the tale of bravery began after mr @entity2 was posted as an assistant manager to @entity28 in @entity12 in 1975			1
he developed a close relationship with his 34 co-workers and their families and hosted barbecues at his villa			0
but that april , just three weeks before @entity12 fell - now known as @entity12 - mr @entity34 was ordered by @entity28 in @entity35 to burn all the important files and leave immediately			1
reliving the traumatic time , he told @entity38 : ' they said , " @entity2 , we 've chartered a 747 @entity40 that 's coming in			2
and we want to take all of your staff and leave the bank and get out to this plane			0
' " mr @entity34 realised that the bank 's 34 @entity6 employees , tellers , secretaries , accountants would be left in a dangerous situation once he left - there were rumours of reprisals by the @entity10 against anyone working for the @entity3			1
he attempted to draw up a plan with his @entity28 bosses in @entity57 to evacuate them including trying to send in helicopters and even an oil tanker			0
but after exhausting all possible options , including asking the @entity3 government for help , the team were told in no uncertain terms that if they tried to carry out a daring rescue mission they would be fired			2
but then mr @entity2 's immediate boss , @entity66 , a former @entity3 marine told told him that one of the pair needed to go back to help			1
reunited : mr @entity2 with his his co-workers and their families who he helped rescue from @entity12 determined : faced with the prospect of losing his job or saving his friends , mr @entity2 caught the last commercial flight in @entity12 in a desperate rescue mission faced with the prospect of losing his job or saving his friends , mr @entity2 caught the last commercial flight in @entity12 in a desperate rescue mission			1
he then set about formulating a plan just 11 days before the fall , moving his former co-workers and their families - 105 in total - into his villa and another one nearby			2
four days later mr @entity2 was told by a @entity85 agent that now the only way to escape @entity87 was on a @entity3 military cargo plane that was evacuating @entity3 and their dependents			1
mr @entity2 reminisced : ' he says , " the evacuation has been begun			2
take your family and go out to the airport and process them through			0
" ' and i said , ' well , i do n't have a family			0
' and he said , " just create a wife and children , no matter who they are , and go out there and sign the documents			0
" ' determined to try to save the group mr @entity2 took a bank van to an airfield and filled out a form certifying on a @entity3 government document that he had a @entity6 wife and 14 children - even though on closer inspection some of the children were actually older than him			1
fall : @entity6 soldiers running past destroyed aircraft on the tarmac of @entity12 's @entity115 after @entity117 troops shelled the airport			1
several hours later @entity12 fell into the the hands of the @entity117 troops , marking an end to the @entity87 war capture : a 30 april 1975 photo shows a line of captured @entity3 - backed @entity126 soldiers , escorted by @entity6 communist soldiers , as they walk on a @entity12 street after the city fell into the hands of the communist troops evacuation : the last @entity132 helicopter lifts off from the landing pad atop the @entity3 embassy during the evacuation of @entity12 after signing a ceasefire , the last @entity3 troops left @entity87 in march 1973 , almost 58,000 are dead , and over 1,000 are missing in action			1
some 150,000 @entity3 were seriously wounded			2
but the unrest continues as southern and northern forces are accused each other of breaking the terms of the truce and fighting continues			0
the north make progressive gains and the south 's defences weaken as the @entity3 withdraws aid - @entity149 launches an offensive to gain control of the whole country			2
the south @entity6 army crumble faster than expected and millions of refugees fled towards @entity12			1
on 21 april , the @entity156 president @entity155 resigns and flees to @entity157			0
six days later the city was surrounded and on 29 april the @entity3 ordered the helicopter evacuation of 7,000 @entity3 administrators and @entity156 from the city			1
refugees battled to join the exodus			0
the following day , @entity165 tanks drove unopposed into central @entity12			2
the city was renamed @entity12			0
a @entity6 man , left , is punched by an @entity3 while trying to board the last helicopter he then went and picked the group up and they were flown out of the country to safety			1
over the next four days as fear gripped the city , @entity2 repeated this ruse 10 times , filling out papers with groups of six or eight			2
the women and children were all transported out safely , but it was even more risky to help the husbands that were left behind as they were more of a target			0
mr @entity2 managed to get them all fake adoption papers as his sons and they took a @entity3 embassy evacuation bus to the airport			1
but they were terrified when the bus was stopped at a checkpoint and a @entity6 police officer stepped on the bus to carry out an inspection			0
a @entity6 women jumped up and shoved a bag containing a bribe into his hands and the bus moved on to airport safely			0
the group were one of the last to fly out of @entity12 - after that the only method of escape were the helicopters at the @entity3 embassy			1
later that week the @entity10 and @entity165 took over and raised their flag over the @entity156 presidential palace the fall of @entity12 , two years after @entity3 troops left @entity87 , is seen by many as the final day of the @entity212			1
the @entity28 employees were flown out to either @entity214 or the @entity215 and then all reunited at @entity216 in @entity217			0
despite defying his company 's orders on his return mr @entity2 was hailed a hero and given a bonus			0
@entity28 also spent a million dollars to resettle all the employees , giving them and many of the spouses , jobs			0
recently mr @entity2 and his ' family ' met up in @entity227 - his ' children ' call him ' @entity229			1
' @entity230 , one of the women he saved told @entity38 : ' he 's so kind , you know , to stay behind and take -- took us out			0
he did so much for us			0
saved my kids and my husband			0
' tens of tens of thousands of @entity156 civilians associated with the southern regime were evacuated in the days preceding the capture of @entity12			2
the evacuation culminated in @entity242 , which was the largest helicopter evacuation in history .			0

@entity2 rescued over 100 of his @entity6 colleagues
saved them just days before the fall of @entity12 in april 1975
@entity2 pretended over 100 people were his family to get them to safety
