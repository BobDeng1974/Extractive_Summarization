mr @entity1 said : ' at first i did n't even know if it was alive , i just stood there staring at it in my bath robe and then suddenly i saw it blink , and i turned round and ran off as fast as i could â€“ slamming the door behind me			1
so mr @entity1 got his neighbours at @entity35 , @entity24 , located about 80 kilometres from the city of @entity37 , to take a look , and they confirmed the find			0
