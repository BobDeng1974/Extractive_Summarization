' we do n't think that snacks are a bad thing , ' @entity74 said			0
' we think that snacks have a place in everybody 's diet , but food served in schools brings with a whole host of challenges			2
i think that there 's other ways that we can collaboratively make kids feel special , and recognize their accomplishments , that do n't necessarily have to involve food			2
' the district 's wellness policy has been in place since 2008 , but @entity74 said that but growing problems like food allergies helped compel them to send the letter			1
