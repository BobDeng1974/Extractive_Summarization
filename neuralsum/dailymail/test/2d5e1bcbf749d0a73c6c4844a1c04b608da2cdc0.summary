so who will be voted @entity1 ? @entity2 is the hot favourite but whoever wins will have plenty of tactical voting to thank			1
i ’m sure @entity2 and the other leading contenders — in my mind @entity10 and @entity11 — will benefit from their team - mates being careful with who they vote for			1
@entity15 recently revealed he had chosen @entity17 midfielder @entity16 — who has been very good but not great — as his nomination			2
there ’s no way @entity15 can seriously believe @entity16 has been better than @entity21 and @entity11 this season ! there is more to it than meets the eye			1
@entity15 , i am almost certain , will have gone around @entity27 ’s dressing room when the ballot papers came in and told the squad — given that you can not choose one of your team - mates — under no circumstances should they vote for @entity21 or @entity11 , who are @entity2 ’s biggest challengers			1
i ’m sure the same happened in the @entity35 and @entity37 dressing rooms			2
@entity27 winger @entity2 is among the front runners to win the @entity1 award this season the @entity41 international has been in superb form for @entity44 's side as they look set to win the title hazard will have to beat off competition from @entity37 goalkeeper @entity10 @entity11 is another of the favourites to pick up the individual gong after his heroics for @entity35 how do i know ? i did exactly the same thing in 2006 when @entity52 won ! i was @entity17 ’s @entity1 representative back then and i made it clear that , for @entity54 to win , nobody should vote for @entity56 or @entity57 ! you might think that ’s unfair but it is the same in every dressing room			1
the voting is , of course , already done but @entity2 and @entity21 come up against each other on saturday and will both be eager to show that they should be regarded as the season ’s standout performer			1
@entity37 are flying and the reason they are in this position is down to @entity21			2
he has come of age during the past two years and his performances in the first half of the campaign gave them a platform to build from			2
he is now in the top three goalkeepers in the world — when he arrived he was n’t even in the top three in the @entity80			2
he will probably be the club ’s player of the year again and that is as big an achievement as being up for the @entity1 award			1
the first time i played against him , he looked like a kid who had been pulled out of the youth ranks			2
he had no physical presence and it was something @entity17 looked to exploit during an @entity93 tie in january 2012			2
@entity94 says @entity27 captain @entity15 will have told his squad not to vote for @entity11 or @entity21 to give @entity2 a better chance of winning the award @entity27 captain @entity15 revealed his vote for @entity1 was @entity16 @entity94 believes @entity21 is one of the main reasons @entity37 are enjoying such a successful run @entity21 endured a difficult start to his @entity37 career as he struggled with physicality of the @entity80 @entity2 - @entity27 @entity105 - @entity27 @entity11 - @entity35 @entity107 - @entity106 @entity10 - @entity37 @entity16 - @entity17 @entity108 scored a header to put us 1 - 0 up but his task was made easier because we crowded @entity21 out and he simply did n’t have the power or the confidence to barge his way through a crowd of bodies			1
that is not something you could say about him now			2
but as good as he has been , i feel @entity21 will miss out on becoming the first goalkeeper to win @entity1 since @entity123 in 1976			1
first , i think it helps if the winner comes from a team that are on course to win a trophy			2
barring an unforeseen blip , @entity27 will win the title and that is why , if i was still playing , my vote would have gone to hazard			2
he , simply , has been the best player in the best team			2
people may say ‘ what about @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 ? ’ — the last three men to lift the @entity1 crown — but the consistency and quality of their performances meant they were impossible to ignore			1
@entity2 's @entity27 team - mate @entity105 has also been nominated for the award after netting 19 league goals @entity106 's @entity107 makes the six - man shortlist after an impressive debut season in @entity151 @entity15 voted for @entity17 's @entity16 , who completes the six - man shortlist the @entity153 nominations are : @entity2 - @entity27 @entity11 - @entity35 @entity16 - @entity17 @entity154 - @entity17 @entity10 - @entity37 @entity155 - @entity27 i mentioned @entity15 will have been influential in the @entity27 dressing room when it came to voting			1
but on a serious note about him , i am very surprised that he is not on the shortlist			1
i would go as far to say that if @entity27 should have two contenders , it should be @entity2 and their captain , both of whom have started all 31 league matches — not @entity105			1
i ’m not saying @entity105 has n’t been good but has he done more to influence @entity27 ’s play than @entity15 ? i ’m not sure			0
@entity15 is still the best defender in the country and the heartbeat of his team			0
is he playing better than he was five or six years ago ? no. but he does n’t allow his standard to drop			0
put it another way — if he and @entity105 were absent for a game of great importance , i know who they would miss more			0
you could say something similar about @entity11			1
his goals have helped @entity35 collect 21 points they might have gone without			0
he was at his peak when voting started and i ’d be surprised if he does n’t win the @entity184 award			1
@entity15 has been as influential as ever for @entity27 this season and deserved a nomination ahead of @entity105 , according to @entity94 @entity143 won the award in 2014 and @entity2 picked up the @entity153 award one thing i can not help feeling , however , is that the nominations show that this campaign has been anything but a classic			1
how can the same four players be up for both the @entity1 and @entity184 award ? hazard wo n’t win the award by default but he certainly has n’t got a highlights reel to match @entity143 , @entity200 or @entity144			1
it is interesting to see how @entity2 measures up with @entity144 , who is getting criticism in @entity203 for not making a big enough impact at @entity205 , yet after 27 games in @entity207 he has scored 13 goals and made seven assists			1
@entity2 , by contrast , has 12 goals in the @entity80 — three of which have been penalties — and has eight assists			1
there is n’t a great difference in the numbers			0
but only one of them is anywhere close to being voted player of the year in their league			0
that shows us it has n’t been a vintage season			0
@entity205 forward @entity144 has 13 goals and seven assists compared to @entity2 's 12 goals and eight assists , but is receiving criticism in @entity203 our league needs top - class defenders the game of the week in the @entity232 came when @entity205 ’s finest sides went to war at the @entity235			1
i have heard it said that the 0 - 0 draw was boring and the lack of goals made it dull but , in my view , nothing could have been further from the truth			0
it was an absorbing contest , as good a 0 - 0 as you could wish to see , and it showed why @entity151 clubs are struggling to make an impact in the competition			0
there will be a clamour this summer for our top sides to buy more and more exciting , attacking players but the displays of @entity256 pair @entity255 and @entity257 and @entity205 ’s @entity258 and @entity259 showed the kind of additions we should be making			1
@entity256 's @entity257 closes in on @entity205 's @entity144 during the pulsating 0 - 0 draw in the @entity232 @entity256 defender @entity255 challenges @entity263 as neither side managed to breach the other 's defence @entity258 gets criticised in @entity151 for at times being rash but he is a top - class defender — @entity269 emphasised that point on these pages when we spoke last november — and has been at the top for years , while @entity259 is a @entity274 who could become the best in the world			0
@entity255 has attracted the attention of @entity27 and @entity37 and it is easy to see why , but my favourite is @entity257 , a player who would have no qualms about tackling his grandmother to keep a clean sheet			0
he plays with that pure @entity286 grit and steel			0
@entity151 clubs simply do n’t have defenders who are willing to do that , perhaps with the exception of @entity15 , and the statistics from our representatives in the @entity232 this season prove that point emphatically			0
@entity17 , for instance , never kept a clean sheet in six matches in the group stages			0
yes , they were in the same group as @entity205 but failing to shut out @entity300 and @entity301 over four matches was the reason they fell at the first hurdle			0
former @entity17 man @entity94 says @entity203 international @entity258 is a top - class defender @entity94 says nothing would excite him more than the arrival of @entity259 or @entity257 to @entity151 in the last 16 , meanwhile , the numbers were just as damning			1
@entity27 could n’t contain @entity309 over two matches , conceding at both the @entity311 and @entity312 , while @entity313 were easily breached twice by @entity314 when tumbling out			0
@entity106 did keep a clean sheet in @entity316 but by then the damage had been done			0
how could they expect to progress after letting three in at the @entity318 ? the tie was effectively finished by their inability to keep the back door closed at home			0
when @entity151 clubs thrived in @entity326 between 2005 - 2009 , it was because we were defensively solid			0
the @entity232 is the best competition with the best players , so scoring goals should n’t be easy			1
with the new television deal about to kick in , we are going to hear stories about @entity144 returning and bids lined up for @entity334 and @entity335			0
of course , they would be welcome additions			0
nothing , though , would excite me more than the arrival of @entity259 or @entity257			0
@entity27 failed to stop @entity309 scoring in either leg of their @entity232 last - 16 tie last month @entity313 's backline was easily breached by @entity314 in their @entity232 contest too			0
