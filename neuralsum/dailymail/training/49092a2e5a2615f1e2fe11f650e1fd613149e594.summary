by @entity0 published : 04:25 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 05:56 est , 1 april 2013 the biggest shake - up of the welfare state in @entity4 history comes today as a wide range of cost - cutting austerity measures take effect for the first time			1
the @entity9 is hoping to save billions of pounds by slashing legal aid , limiting benefits handouts and restructuring the @entity12			1
the average family is set to be £ 5,000 worse - off than at the time of the last election - but @entity17 ministers insist their reforms will make the system ' fairer '			1
@entity21 and @entity30 today said that their welfare changes were not ' @entity32 '			2
they continued : ' in reality , we are just restoring the original principles of the welfare state : that those who can work must work , and a life on benefits must not be more attractive than working			0
' ' bedroom tax ' comes into effect today perhaps the most controversial move is the so - called ' bedroom tax ' , which will see social housing tenants with spare rooms docked an average of £ 14 a week in benefits			1
around 660,000 people are set to lose some of their housing benefit from the change , which is expected to save the government £ 465million a year			0
the charge is aimed at reducing over-crowding in social housing and directing benefits towards those who are most in need			0
but @entity59 has relentless attacked the move , with shadow chancellor @entity61 denouncing it as ' possibly the worst , most cack - handed and massively unfair piece of policy - making i 've ever seen '			1
defence : @entity30 insists the changes will make the welfare system ' fairer ' for claimants and taxpayers legal aid cut drastically from today financial help in the legal system is set to be restricted to those whose household income is less than £ 32,000 , with means - testing for all but the poorest claimants			1
divorce cases , personal injury and immigration appeals will no longer be covered by legal aid , meaning that experts expect a spike in the number of plaintiffs who will represent themselves in court			1
the aim is to cut the £ 2.2billion legal aid bill by at least £ 350million			1
@entity12 commissioning changes today after nearly three years of wrangling , the @entity89 faces its widest - ranging reforms ever today , with commissioning handed over to consortiums of @entity94			1
private companies will be allowed to compete to provide state - funded services for the first time , which ministers hope will drive down costs in the @entity12			1
the abolition of strategic health authorities and primary care trusts is expected to save £ 1.4billion in the short term with savings rising to £ 5billion by the time of the next election in 2015			1
council tax benefit cut from today council tax refunds for low - income households will today be transferred from the @entity110 into the control of local councils			1
officials are using the switch as an opportunity to cut the size of the benefit by 10 per cent , saving as much as half a billion pounds a year			0
in additions , 2.4million families will have their council tax bill raised , despite the @entity9 's attempts to keep the cost of the tax down			2
out of work : the changes are aimed at forcing the jobless back into employment 50p tax rate abolished on saturday this weekend , high earners will find have the rate of tax charged on earnings over £ 100,000 cut from 50p to 45p			2
mr @entity21 announced the move in last year 's @entity135 in a bid to make @entity4 more business - friendly , claiming the 50p rate had raised £ 15billion less than expected			2
however , @entity59 has denounced it as a millionaires ' tax cut , with 13,000 of the super-rich saving £ 100,000 each			1
benefit ' uprating ' starts a week on monday next monday , benefits will see their annual rise - but they will be increased by just one per cent , which is lower than the rate of inflation			2
the @entity9 has limited the rise in benefits for the next three years due to the slow rate of wages growth , claiming it is unfair for the unemployed to see their earnings rise faster than those in work			0
the measure is supposed to save £ 505million this year , with further savings for as long as it remains in place			0
disability living allowance abolished next monday on the same day , disability living allowance will be replaced by personal independence payment			0
the idea is to correlate benefits payments more closely to the needs of the disabled - so they will no longer be determined by claimants ' medical conditions , but by how their disability affects what they can do			0
but campaigners are concerned that the change will provide an excuse to limit payouts to the disabled in order to save money			0
benefit cap begins on april 15 the centrepiece of the @entity9 's welfare reforms is the promise to limit each family 's handouts to the average household income			0
the scheme will be piloted in four @entity189 boroughs from april 15 , and it is set to take effect throughout the country by the end of september			0
no household will be entitled to receive more than £ 26,000 in benefits each year , although working tax credits are not included in the total			2
@entity198 credit rolls out on april 28 six of the main benefits payments are being integrated into a single system , starting with a trial scheme in @entity204 - under - @entity203 from april 28			2
the move is supposed to simplify the process of paying and receiving benefits , and make it easier to job - seekers to find work			0
criticism : shadow chancellor @entity61 described the ' bedroom tax ' as ' cack - handed and massively unfair ' changes set to leave families £ 5,000 poorer overall overall , a family earning a total of £ 34,000 will have lost £ 4,747 this year compared to three years ago , according to think - tank the @entity219			1
despite a rise in the personal income tax allowance which will save most people around £ 270 a year , cuts to working tax credit , child benefit and child tax credit will leave most households worse off			1
the allowance - the amount of money on which no tax is due - will rise from £ 8,105 to £ 9,440 in the coming tax year as part of a major @entity9 policy inspired by the @entity235			1
writing in the @entity236 , mr @entity21 and mr @entity30 said : ' our changes will ensure that the welfare state offers the right help to those who need it , and is fair to those who pay for it			0
' of course , if you listened to the shrill voices of the @entity247 you 'd think that every change to the welfare system , and any attempt to save money , marks @entity32			0
' in reality , we are just restoring the original principles of the welfare state : that those who can work must work , and a life on benefits must not be more attractive than working			0
' ending what ministers call a ' spare room subsidy ' would address the ' scandal ' of a million people living in overcrowded conditions and millions more on waiting lists , they added			0
but shadow work and pensions secretary @entity266 said : ' this wicked bedroom tax is going to rip neighbour from neighbour , force vulnerable people to food banks and loan sharks , and end up costing @entity4 more than it saves as tenants are forced to go homeless or move into the expensive private rented sector			1
' it is the worst possible blend of cruelty and incompetence			0
the government must think again and drop this tax now			0
' pensions minister @entity282 insisted the highest earners had taken the biggest hit , telling @entity286 's @entity285 this morning : ' we are trying to make savings but we 're also trying to protect the most vulnerable			0
' we 're not saying you ca n't have a spare bedroom , what we are saying is you contribute £ 2 a day on average if you have that extra bedroom			2
some people , yes money 's tight , but will say £ 2 a day for a spare bedroom is worth paying , others will swap with others into smaller accommodation			2
' video legal aid cuts would have left @entity301 without money to support their deaf daughter			1

' bedroom tax ' introduced today will cost households £ 14 a week
massive legal aid cuts mean family *law* cases will not be state - funded
biggest *nhs* shake - up ever as *gps* take over commissioning of care today
ministers insist system will be ' fairer ' but @entity59 denounces cuts
