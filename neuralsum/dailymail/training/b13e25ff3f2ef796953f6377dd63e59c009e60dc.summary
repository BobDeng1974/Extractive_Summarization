by @entity0 for @entity1 some videos and images taken from the @entity4 are so incredible that they can leave you questioning their authenticity			2
but this time - lapse of an aurora surrounding the @entity4 as it completes an orbit of our planet is very much the real deal			2
the amazing footage was captured by @entity15 astronaut @entity14 on the station last week			1
@entity17 can be seen an animation of the moment @entity15 astronaut @entity14 and his crewmates on the @entity4 spottted an aurora around the iss. the green light is caused by the interaction of solar wind with particles in @entity27 's atmosphere			1
part of the huge solar array can also be seen moving ( credit : @entity15 / @entity31 ) the time - lapse was created by photographs taken on board the iss by members of the @entity37 crew			1
there are two types of aurora - @entity40 , which means ‘ dawn of the north ’ , and @entity43 ’ , known as ‘ dawn of the south			0
’ as their names imply , the former are seen in the northern hemisphere and the latter in the southern hemisphere			0
they are caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the @entity27 ’s atmosphere			1
these so - called geomagnetic storms occur when a solar wind or cloud of magnetic field hits the @entity27 ’s magnetic field			1
usually the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the @entity27 ’s magnetic field , but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles			1
as a result , auroras are most common around the magnetic poles and are most often seen in areas with little light pollution			2
auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common			0
shades of red , yellow , green , blue , and violet have also been reported			0
the common , greenish - yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules approximately 60 miles ( 96km ) above @entity27			2
rare , red auroras are produced by oxygen molecules situated much higher up , at around 200 miles ( 320km )			0
nitrogen produces blue or purplish - red aurora			0
it shows the station orbiting the planet as normal before green lights begin to come into view			0
the @entity4 then flies right through the aurora , revealing a stunning sight that only a handful of people have seen with their own eyes			2
‘ we flew right through a massive aurora after last week ’s solar mass ejection , ’ @entity14 , from @entity97 , commented			1
the @entity4 completes an orbit every 92 minutes , but sights of this sort are fairly rare			0
while auroras have certainly been spotted from space before , it ’s not all that common for the station to fly through one			0
this is because the station ’s orbit generally remains fairly close to the the equator , so it does n’t venture too far towards the poles of our planet			2
it is around the @entity117 pole where auroras are generally most apparent , as this is where @entity27 ’s magnetic fields are most concentrated			1
auroras are caused by the interaction of solar wind with magnetically charged particles in the atmosphere			1
however , during periods of increased solar activity the amount of solar wind hitting @entity27 increases			1
this means there are more collisions taking place in @entity27 ’s atmosphere and , consequently , this can push the lights closer to @entity27 ’s equator			1
it is on occasions like this that more regions of @entity27 are able to witness the @entity142 or @entity143 lights , with auroras sometimes reported as far south as the @entity145 during these events			0
and it seems that a recent increase in solar activity also treated the residents of the @entity4 to the fascinating sight			1
the @entity4 ( pictured ) completes an orbit every 92 minutes , but sights of this sort are fairly rare			0
while auroras have certainly been spotted from space before , it ’s not all that common for the station to fly through one			0
this is because the station ’s orbit generally keeps it fairly near the equator the astronauts are continuing their groundbreaking research on the @entity4 , with a new crew set to travel to the station next month , while @entity168 cosmonauts are also preparing for a spacewalk today			1
and recently @entity14 took part in a live @entity171 to answer questions from people on @entity27			2
one included sir @entity174 , who asked : ‘ what do you think the role of astronauts will be in 50 years ’ time ? pioneers ? guides ? or the norm ? ’ @entity14 responded : ‘ my hope would be that in 50 years from now , space travellers will not only be professional agency astronauts , but that everybody should have a realistic chance to make the incredible experience i am having right now			0
‘ anyway , i hope there will still be pioneers out there who will fly to destinations farther away			0
’ @entity14 ( pictured ) is part of @entity37 on the @entity193 month they will be welcoming three new crewmembers to the space station when three of the current crew return to @entity27			1
@entity14 has been prolific on @entity198 ( @ @entity199 ) and frequently tweets stunning images and video from space			0

@entity15 astronaut @entity14 has captured stunning footage from the @entity4
the @entity97 watched as an aurora surrounded the station in green light
the event occurred after a period of increased solar activity last week
when the sun is more active auroras are seen above @entity27 at lower *latitudes*
this makes them **visible** to astronauts on the iss and also to *observers* on @entity27 closer to the equator
they are usually only **visible** near @entity27 's @entity226 poles where the magnetic fields are *strongest*
they are caused by the interaction of solar wind with magnetically charged particles in @entity27 's atmosphere
when the sun is more active an increase in solar wind pushes them lower
