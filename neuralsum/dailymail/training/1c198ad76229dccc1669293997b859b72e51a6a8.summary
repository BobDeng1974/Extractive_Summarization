by @entity0 published : 13:42 est , 9 march 2014 updated : 17:39 est , 9 march 2014 as a gale swept through @entity5 on the night of friday , march 11 , 1864 , water engineer @entity2 was sheltering under the town 's new dam when he noticed a crack			1
it was only wide enough to take a penknife , but it stretched along the earthen bank for 50 yards , following a jagged line 12 yards from the top			0
just before midnight the dam burst , sending 650 million gallons of water cascading into central @entity5 in a disaster which killed more than 240 people in their beds			1
devastation : quickly dubbed the @entity21 , the torrent killed around 300 people and destroyed 700 buildings			1
pictured : the remains of the @entity25 in @entity26			0
one body washed up 18 miles away washed away : @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 ( pictured ) , was one of the 20 destroyed in the torrent half of those who died instantly were children , and around 60 more were killed as diseases swept through the stagnant water in the aftermath			1
historians will mark the 150th anniversary of the tragedy on tuesday - but they say one of @entity44 's worst disasters has been largely forgotten because the dead were northern and working - class			1
for years there was not a full - scale memorial to those who died in @entity5 , with only a small memorial stone near the village of @entity52 where the reservoir stood			1
amateur historian @entity54 , who devotes her spare time to tracing victims ' descendants , said : ' i am passionate about the flood			0
it is this country 's worst ever man - made disaster but virtually nobody knows about it			1
' it 's such a tragedy that so many people died through no fault of their own			1
remembrance : local historians say the disaster was largely forgotten because its victims were northern and working - class			1
for years there was no memorial in central @entity5 with only a memorial stone near the dam ' if it had happened in @entity78 there would be an annual memorial for it			1
everyone would know about it			0
but , because it was in the north and because it involved working class people nobody remembers it			1
' the dam was built by the @entity89 near the village of @entity52 from 1859 to provide drinking water for the people of the fast - growing industrial town			1
it was also designed to provide a supply of running water for the mills in surrounding villages			2
but as it was being completed and filled the structure collapsed , sending water cascading down the @entity102 which devastated farms and hamlets devoted to metalworking			2
the floodwater then moved down to meet the @entity107 and laid waste to large areas of the centre of @entity5			2
one body was found at @entity112 - 18 miles downstream			2
harrowing stories emerged of how many of the victims died			2
one person who drowned was a new - born baby washed from his mother 's arms in @entity52			2
huge : workmen inspect the break in the dam wall at the @entity121 after it burst			2
a water engineer had noticed there was a crack a few hours before the disaster , wide enough to take a penknife toll : more than 100 died in the village of @entity129 , where many homes and the @entity131 ( left ) , were left in ruins			1
the area has since been rebuilt and is now a suburb of @entity5 , which would become a city three children died in a cellar in @entity5 while their parents were away			1
then a village and now a suburb , @entity129 was worst hit by the flood with 102 deaths			0
a photograph of the shattered remains of the @entity131 , rebuilt later as the @entity145 , is one of the many striking images of the disaster			2
@entity5 historian @entity149 , who lives in @entity129 , said it was ' ground - zero			1
it was devastated , whole families wiped out , buildings just washed away			2
' if it had happened in @entity78 there would be an annual memorial for it			0
everyone would know about it			0
but , because it was in the north and because it involved working class people nobody remembers it			1
' - @entity167 historian @entity54 ' the death toll of the flood was massive			0
there 's nothing else to compare with it in peacetime in terms of man - made disasters			0
' we remember pit disasters and other tragedies and i think it 's only right this is remembered too			0
' mr @entity2 raised the alarm after he spotted the crack at 5.30pm that day , but he thought it posed no major risk			0
it was examined later that evening but by 9pm the contractors had gone home , saying it would not be a danger to the public			0
that did not stop the water firm 's resident engineer , a mr @entity191 , travelling with a colleague that night to examine the state of the dam			1
according to @entity197 , a journalist who was writing at the time , they crossed the dangerously unstable bank before his colleague cried : ' if we do n't relieve the dam of water there 'll be a blow up in half an hour			2
' they tried to blow up a weir to relieve the pressure , but for one reason or another the gunpowder would not ignite			0
by then it was too late			0
as one inspector put it , according to mr @entity197 : ' not even a @entity215 horse could have carried the warning in time to have saved the people down the valley			0
' mr @entity2 's great - great - great - grandson , @entity219 , still lives in @entity52 and is the parish archivist			0
memories : the reservoir still exists near the village of @entity52 ( pictured ) , six miles from @entity5 industrial heartland : the reservoir was being filled to provide drinking water to @entity5 's growing population this weekend , locals gathered at an exhibition in the village to mark the anniversary , one of a number of events over the next few days to remember the disaster			1
the ceremonies will include a wreath - laying ceremony at a memorial to the tragedy in @entity5 city centre on tuesday			1
guided walks and church services are also talking place and primary school children will sing songs commissioned especially to remember the disaster			0
@entity246 , whose book on the disaster is due out later this year , said : ' it 's not even very well known about in @entity5 , never mind nationally			1
' it was a major historical event and it needs to be remembered properly			0
' @entity250 has travelled from @entity251 to attend the memorial as she is descended from some of the victims			0
she said : ' it 's such a massive disaster and it 's right it 's remembered like this even though it was 150 years ago			0
