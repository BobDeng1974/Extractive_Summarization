by @entity0 published : 20:07 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 03:11 est , 16 november 2012 rising numbers of @entity2 are suffering burns from hot water bottles , warn experts			1
researchers say they have become increasingly popular in the home as a cheap alternative to turning on the heating			0
but if the bottles are poorly made or the rubber has perished , they can explode without warning during the night			0
this can cause serious burns or scalds which in some cases are so serious that patients require skin grafts			0
researchers say the number of hot water bottles being used in @entity2 has risen due to the rising cost of the heating researchers at @entity25 say that the numbers needing hospital treatment for hot water bottle burns has risen in the last two years			1
but they say these admissions only represent a handful of the true numbers suffering injuries as most will not go to hospital			2
one reason for the increase is that people are buying cheap hot water bottles from abroad made from rubber that easily perishes			1
furthermore the researchers say rising numbers of families are using them as a ' cost - effective ' way of staying warm in the hope of saving on their energy bills			1
@entity46 , of @entity25 , said : ' anecdotally we have seen an increase in burns caused by hot water bottles in the last couple of years			1
' it could be that more people are using them as a cost - effective way of keeping warm or it could be that people are buying cheaper hot water bottles over the internet from abroad			2
' what we have seen at the hospital is only the tip of the iceberg , as the majority of these cases go unreported			0
people try and manage the burns themselves , often because they are embarrassed about what they have done or the area they have burnt			0
' when looking at burns from hot water bottles it is sometimes difficult to say which have been caused by patient misuse and which are due to poor manufacturing standards			1
' what is clear is that there is a need to increase awareness of the ability of hot water bottles to cause significant long - term burn injuries and also highlight the precautionary measures that could be taken to prevent such injuries			2
' one common problem is people storing them incorrectly , which can cause the rubber to perish			0
' the researchers looked at the medical notes of 50 patients who had suffered burns and scalds from hot water bottles			1
they found that injuries took an average of 25 days to heal - three and a half weeks			0
and in three of the patients , including two children , the burns were so serious they needed skin grafts			0
in some cases patients were to blame for the injuries as they had filled bottles with boiling water that causes the rubber to wear out			0
the @entity107 does not compile figures on the numbers of patients needing treatment for hot water bottle burns			1
but last year more than 1,800 were admitted to hospital following injuries caused by hot water or other hot fluids , which would include hot water bottles .			2
