aboard the flagship was @entity9 director @entity8 , who captured the historic event on one of the earliest 16mm color cameras for his own personal records			1
he continued to film the war in kodachrome through the beaches of @entity17 , onwards to the liberation of @entity19 , confronting the horrors of @entity22 concentration camps and finally , entering a war - ravaged @entity23			1
warning : graphic images scroll down for @entity26 ok , let 's go : @entity1 fired the opening shots of @entity29 in june 6 , 1944 , signifying the largest amphibious invasion in history @entity32 : one of ' @entity35 's irregulars ' films the combined @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 invasion force that landed on the beaches of @entity17 on june 6 , 1944 might : @entity38 warships escort their landing craft to the three beaches they and the @entity39 were earmarked to invade - @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 @entity9 : director @entity8 at his camera aboard @entity1 - he would later go on to win two @entity51 's in the 1950s bearing witness : writers , directors and cameramen from the special coverage unit of the @entity58 fanned out among the @entity58 armies on @entity29 to cover the ' greatest seaborne invasion in history ' his extremely rare film went unseen for decades until his son discovered the developed film after his father 's death - providing color images of pivotal moments hitherto recorded in black - and - white			1
@entity8 , who made his name in the 1930s , directing @entity73 and @entity74 in ' @entity75 ' in 1936 , was dispatched to @entity5 by general @entity76 to head up what he called ' combat motion - picture coverage			2
' planning : @entity80 @entity79 contemplates one of his many victories as @entity58 forces launched their assault on @entity6 forces in @entity5 clearing mines : each town in @entity88 that the @entity89 fought the @entity22 over came at a great cost - as street - to - street fighting , snipers and land mines took their toll on the liberating forces decimated : entire swathes of northern @entity88 were destroyed during the fighting that expelled the @entity22 forces chaos : rustic @entity101 towns lay in ruins after the fierce fighting between @entity58 and @entity6 forces @entity105 ruins : an army jeep drives through what is left of a @entity101 town filmed by the color camera of @entity8 the @entity110 was concerned by the success of @entity113 's @entity6 propaganda movies and wanted to produce his own 35mm monochrome film for newsreels back home			1
while those were a success , it was the personal footage that @entity8 shot with his own 16mm camera that fascinates today , released for the first time this month on @entity122			0
the unseen film discovered by @entity124 was turned into 1994 's documentary , @entity29 to @entity23 - giving an incredible glimpse into the bittersweet final days of the greatest conflict known to man			1
in the documentary , @entity8 recalls the first time he watched the films , astonished to see his father on board the @entity1 , preparing to land on @entity101 soil			0
son : @entity124 discovered his father 's developed but unedited color film footage of the @entity137 and converted it into a documentary called @entity139 to @entity23 ' @entity140 : @entity37 soldier are greeted like heroes as they enter @entity19 in late august , 1944 , after months of heavy fighting heroes : @entity37 soldier are greeted by @entity19 women as they roll their forces into @entity19 - which spent almost four years under @entity6 control release : four years after @entity6 forces goose - stepped down the @entity151 , @entity37 soldiers ride down the @entity19 boulevard to a rapturous response from the city folk return : general @entity155 is welcomed to the victory parade in @entity19 on august 29 , 1944 ' this film came on and it was sort of grey - blue skies and barrage balloons , those big things that hung in the sky , and it was on a ship			1
' it turned out to be the @entity1 , and it was suddenly i realized the morning of the 6th of june , the beginning of the greatest seaborne invasion in history , ' he said in a recent interview according to @entity171			0
' i had this feeling that my eyes were the first eyes that had n't been there who were seeing this day in color , and i watched this film unfold and on this ship - and all of these men with their flak jackets and anticipation of this day - and around a corner on the ship comes this man - helmet and jacket - and walks into a close - up , and it 's my 37 - year - old father			0
' the filmmaker , who later would win @entity51 's for directing 1951 's ' @entity189 ' and 1956 's ' @entity190 ' begins his color film footage of the war on that fateful day , almost 70 years ago			2
next stop @entity23 : @entity8 then traveled with @entity37 troops as they made their way across the heartland of @entity6 allies : as they drove further and further into @entity6 - they were greeted by the flags of the @entity202 - @entity201 , the @entity203 and the @entity37 his remarkable historical account takes his filming unit across decimated @entity101 towns , were street - to - street fighting proved an attritional slog			1
onwards from there , @entity8 witnessed first hand the liberation of @entity19 , where generals @entity155 , @entity214 and @entity79 all vied behind the scenes for battlefield glory			0
@entity8 films the launch of the failed @entity219 , popularly known as ' @entity220 ' , in which @entity38 and @entity37 paratroopers failed to take @entity222 - to arguably shorten the war			0
at @entity224 , @entity8 saw the sheer horror of humanity - his color images of dead bodies providing a glimpse of the evil of the @entity6 final solution			2
horrors : but at @entity224 , @entity8 was confronted with the full evil capabilities of man at the concentration camp disgust : he saw first - hand and filmed in color what the @entity6 's had committed as they sought their final solution heartbreaking : many of the @entity224 concentration camp ' inmates ' were quarantined and sprayed with @entity242 following a typhus outbreak to prevent further deaths cowardly : following liberation , some of the @entity22 troops in @entity224 pretended to be @entity250 prisoners to avoid arrest and punishment , according to @entity8 ' reports grainy : at the @entity256 , @entity203 troops crossed the river to meet @entity37 soldiers for their historic first meeting ' it was extraordinary to see them all together ' : a week after leaving @entity263 , @entity262 had been encircled			1
this was the largest surrender of @entity137 that had been photographed in color : this grainy grab of @entity8 footage shows the moment that @entity203 and @entity37 forces exchanged flags as they met on the banks of the @entity256 final destination : once victory was secured after @entity275 , @entity8 filmed the aftermath at the @entity277 in a decimated @entity23 the allies drove eastward : @entity280 's 12th @entity279 made contact with @entity283 personnel near the @entity22 town of @entity285 on the banks of the @entity256 , linking the @entity37 and @entity287 army @entity8 then carried on into @entity6 and captured the momentous meeting of the forces of the @entity37 and the @entity203 on the banks of the @entity256			1
@entity29 to @entity23 is narrated by @entity124 and contains interviews with his father 's film crew , known as the ' @entity8 irregulars '			0
' we thought at the time that this was the only color film of the war in @entity5			2
as it turned out , there was some @entity22 film that had not yet been discovered , ' he said			0
' but it is the greatest body of color film , and @entity137 was a black - and - white war			2
that 's how we see it			0
that 's how we saw it			0
and suddenly to see it in color , it just took on a whole other dimension			0
