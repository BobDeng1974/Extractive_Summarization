by @entity1 reporter published : 23:27 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 02:47 est , 11 january 2013 a pod of killer whales that became trapped underneath the sea ice off the @entity6 coast has been freed			1
locals in @entity9 's @entity8 had rallied to help the dozen whales in a story that mirrored a 1988 scenario in @entity13 that was portrayed on the big screen by @entity15 in the 2012 film @entity16			1
locals in the small fishing village of @entity19 raced to the scene some 30km off the coast after the mammals were seen gathering around a single hole in the ice - slightly bigger than a pickup truck - in a desperate bid to get oxygen			1
it was feared that the small hole would freeze up causing the whales to drown but fortunately changing tides caused the ice to shift creating a clear route for them to swim to the safety of the open sea			1
the pod of 12 whales have now swum to safety after tides caused the ice to shift opening up a channel to the open sea @entity51 situation : desperate for oxygen , the whales were seen surfacing from the small hole in the thick ice			1
the animals normally stay underwater for between three and eight minutes at a time help : the local mayor has asked the government to intervene and send an ice breaker			1
the trapped orcas appeared to be in distress local businessman @entity62 said two hunters reported that the waters had opened up around the area where the cornered whales had been bobbing frantically for air			1
he said : ' they confirmed that the whales were no longer there and there was a lot of open water			2
it 's certainly good news - that 's good news for the whales			2
' locals said the whales had been trapped around a single , truck - sized breathing hole for at least two days			1
a recent sudden drop in temperature may have caught the whales off guard , leaving them trapped under the ice			1
@entity62 said the winds seemed to shift overnight , pushing the floating ice further away from the shore			2
the cornered animals were first seen tuesday and appeared to have less energy by late wednesday , @entity62 said			0
@entity19 mayor @entity91 has said @entity6 's @entity92 informed him that government icebreakers were too far from the area to smash the ice to free the whales			1
@entity62 said locals had agreed to try to enlarge the existing breathing hole and cut a second opening using chainsaws and drills			2
' we certainly had our prayers with them last night during our meeting , ' he said			0
ice - trapped marine mammals are not unusual in the region			2
mayor @entity91 had urged the @entity6 government on wednesday to send an icebreaker as soon as possible to crack open the ice and help them find open water			1
the @entity92 had been preparing to send officials to assess the situation			0
location : the whales became trapped under the sea ice some 30km from the coast in @entity120 by the small fishing village of @entity19 1,500km north of @entity122 @entity123 : @entity15 played an animal activist in the film ' @entity16 , ' who works to free trapped whales in @entity13 @entity128 : in the film , which is based on a true story , @entity15 's character launches a massive media campaign to encourage politicians to support a rescue effort dozens of villagers had made the one - hour snowmobile ride on tuesday to see the unusual spectacle			1
they snapped photos and shot video footage of the killer whales surfacing in the opening - and even thrusting themselves skyward while gasping for air			0
like all marine mammals killer whales do n't breathe underwater and get their oxygen through their blowhole when they rise to the surface			2
they normally stay underwater for between three and eight minutes but have been known to stay submerged for up to 30 minutes at a time			0
by comparison sperm whales and bottlenose whales can stay under for as long as 90 to 120 minutes respectively			0
killer whales are among the fastest swimming marine mammals and can reach speeds of up to 28 mph but only for short periods			0
they normally cruise at around 8 mph and can sustain such speed for long periods of time			0
unlike narwhals , belugas and bowheads , they are not an ice - loving species and generally head north to hunt during the summer months but return before the ice moves in			0
mr @entity91 believed the sudden drop in temperature recently caught the orcas off guard , leaving them boxed in under the ice			0
he suggested that the pod , which consists of two adults and a number of younger whales , could be a single family and that they were clearly in trouble			1
speaking before the whales were able to make their break to safety , he said : ' it appears from time to time that they panic			0
' other times they are gone for a long time , probably looking for another open space , which they are not able to find			0
' locals said the killer whales were seen thrusting themselves skyward while gasping for air			2
one woman who made the journey to the gap in the ice said even a curious polar bear approached the hole amid the commotion			2
@entity199 said the bear was shot by a local hunter for its meat			0
@entity204 , 21 , had hitched a ride on a snowmobile on wednesday morning to go out to see them and got to about three metres from the water 's edge			0
she told @entity6 's @entity211 news : ' i saw the big head popping out of the waters ... i could n't believe what i was seeing			1
' they kind of looked like they needed help			0
they 're sharing this small little hole			0
they were probably searching for a way to go out , but at the moment they have no other choice but to stay there because it 's all ice â€” all over			2
' @entity199 said the hole appeared to be shrinking in the freezing temperatures			0
@entity91 believes the sudden drop in temperature recently caught the orcas off guard , leaving them boxed in under the ice			0
the whale 's plight mirrored that of three gray whales which became packed under ice in the @entity238 near @entity239 in northern @entity13 in 1988			1
that incident was the inspiration for last year 's film @entity16 starring @entity15 as a @entity244 environmental activist who led to effort to bring media and political attention to the matter while @entity249 portrayed a local television reporter			1
local villagers , who came to watch , had called for help from the @entity6 government to free the pod plight : the trapped pod were first spotted surfacing by a local hunter trapped : a killer whale surfaces through a small hole in the ice near @entity19 , in @entity9 locals were concerned that the freezing weather was actually making the hole smaller and said they need help urgently the killer whales were seen thrusting themselves into the air in order to breathe the effort to free the whales , dubbed @entity128 , gained national attention and eventually the @entity271 enlisted the help from the @entity273 to use two ice breaker ships			1
one of the whales died while the effort was underway but the two remaining were able to escape after the @entity273 ships cleared away a path through the ice .			1

the whale pod has gathered around single hole in the ice to breathe about 30km off the @entity6 coast
locals in @entity9 's @entity8 are appealing for help to free the animals over fears they could drown
the town 's mayor has appealed to the government to send an icebreaker ship to carve a path to freedom
the whale 's plight mirrors a 1998 incident when three grey whales became trapped under ice in @entity13
that rescue effort became the inspiration for last year 's film @entity16 starring @entity15
