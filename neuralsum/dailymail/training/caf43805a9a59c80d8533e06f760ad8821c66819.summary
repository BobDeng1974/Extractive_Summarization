but with a beaming smile and a few tears , @entity7 finally crossed the finish line of the @entity11 yesterday after a gruelling 16 days			1
yet organisers have refused to honour her achievement with an official medal because she did not finish within 24 hours			1
instead , 14 fellow runners inspired by her heroism , have donated theirs			1
the snub by @entity20 officials has prompted outrage , with scores of comments on @entity24 and even some sports stars calling for them to reconsider			1

event rider : @entity7 in action on horseback before her accident final stretch : the former chiropractor , supported by friends and family , makes the turn past @entity57 today as she neared the @entity11 finishing line walking tall : @entity7 's £ 43,000 suit allows people with lower - limb paralysis to stand , walk and climb stairs a spokesman for former @entity66 @entity65 tennis player @entity64 , who walked part of the marathon with mrs @entity7 , said he would be fully behind recognising her heroism			1
and 1500m runner @entity70 tweeted that it ' was very sad ' that @entity7 was n't given a medal and even drew @entity20 boss @entity74 's attention to the matter			1
however , for @entity7 , it 's not a gong from the organisers that counts , but the medals from other participants			1
she told @entity81 : ' when i started the challenge , it was never my priority to get a medal as i knew from the start line i would n’t receive one			2
the campaign was always about raising funds and awareness for @entity45			1
' i ’ve been completely overwhelmed by the support from the public , particularly those kind runners that have donated their medals to me			1
i now have 14 ! if anything , these medals mean much more to me than any recognition from the racer organisers			2
' the paralysed 32 - year - old conquered the 26.2 mile course that more than 36,000 ran last month using a mechanical suit to control her legs			1
her achievement has earned her world - wide fame , with the @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and the @entity113 all reporting on it			2
@entity7 lost the use of her legs after breaking her spine when she was thrown from her horse in competitive trials five years ago			1
since then she has been liberated from a wheelchair by a pioneering suit that straps to her limbs and torso , giving her mobility through motion sensors , battery operated motors and an onboard computer system			2
the former chiropractor and her 13 - month - old daughter @entity48 learned to walk together – one for the first time , the other for the second time around			2
ace support : @entity64 walks with @entity7 in @entity132 during her @entity11 walk backing the bid : runner @entity70 posted two messages on @entity24 voicing her concern that mrs @entity7 has n't received a medal celebration time : the emotion of finishing the @entity11 after over 16 days was clearly a lot for @entity7 to take in when she crossed the line this lunchtime mark of respect : @entity7 , who was paralysed in 2007 , stops near the finish line of the marathon to pay her respect to @entity148 , who died during this year 's event yesterday , @entity48 and @entity7 ’s husband @entity32 , whom she met after the accident , accompanied her to the finish line			1
wiping away tears as she was applauded by scores of onlookers , she told me : ‘ i really did n’t expect all this			0
' people have been fantastic and the support i ’ve been given has been a huge help			0
’ a marathon man has smashed the world record for the longest distance covered within a week - by running an incredible 450 miles			1
inspirational @entity165 , 50 , covered more than 18 marathons in six - and - a - half days at an average rate of 69 miles per day			1
he set off from his home in @entity169 , @entity170 , last tuesday and passed the previous world record of 408 miles in nearby @entity172 at 11am on monday ( 7/5 ) with 21 hours to spare			0
@entity165 continued running and crossed the finish line at @entity175 , @entity170 , later on monday after covering a staggering 450 miles in less than one week			2
his achievement was all the more remarkable because eight years ago he could not even walk - after being struck down by a thyroid condition			2
he has notched up half - marathons , marathons and supermarathons before tackling his latest week - long challenge , which has so far raised £ 50,000 for charity			1
@entity7 , who lives near @entity183 , @entity184 , began the race with everyone else on april 22			1
she has since averaged between a mile and 2.5 miles a day			2
ask her what the biggest challenge was and you might expect her to tell you it ’s the pain			0
the mental determination required to keep going			0
or accidentally pressing the suit ’s ‘ sit ’ button when there was nowhere to sit			0
it was none of those			0
‘ it ’s the pavements , ’ she said , raising her voice			0
‘ they ’re so broken up and uneven , and every little bump is a hurdle for me			0
if everything had been flat and even , i ’d have finished days ago ! ‘ there were times when i questioned whether i would make it			0
but once i started , i just took each day as it came			0
once i got out there and saw people cheering me on , it really raised my spirits			0
’ tourists , supporters and family followed in her wake and clapped her along the way			0
among the voices were former @entity225 rower sir @entity223 , tv presenter @entity226 , adventurer @entity227 and three mounted members of the @entity229 , riding in an unofficial guard of honour			0
she had raised more than £ 130,000 for the @entity45 charity when she finished , with the total still rising			1
and the medal ? ‘ this was never about me , ’ she said with genuine selflessness			0
‘ i did n’t do it for a medal , i did it to raise awareness and raise money			0
’ @entity7 ’s entry was not officially timed , and she stayed overnight in a hotel before being driven back to the course each morning			2
there may have been a red tape stretched across the makeshift finish line yesterday but no one , in another sense , was prepared to cut through it			0
@entity11 organisers insisted competitors must complete the course the same day to qualify for a medal			2
among those who donated their own medals was @entity258 , from @entity259			0
‘ she has epitomised what i thought the @entity11 was all about , ’ she said			0
‘ for her not to have got one ridicules what the marathon was all about			0
’ donations can be made at @entity266			1
slowly but surely : @entity7 , pictured earlier this month as she reached the halfway point in the @entity11 the @entity11 is thought to have taken @entity7 around 40 hours , spread over 17 days @entity268 was joined along the way by celebrity fans @entity64 ( pictured ) , @entity271 and sir @entity223			1
