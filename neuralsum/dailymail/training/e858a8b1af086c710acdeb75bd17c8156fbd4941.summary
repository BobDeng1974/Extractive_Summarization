by @entity0 published : 17:48 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 17:49 est , 13 june 2013 with expenses scandals still fresh in the mind , cash for questions dominating headlines , and first - class perks all paid for by the taxpayer , it is perhaps not surprising that mps are not held in the highest regard by voters			0
in fact a major poll has confirmed the image that most mps are only in politics to line their own pockets , revealing that four in five voters do not trust mps and believe that they put their own interests before others			0
the @entity23 survey reveals deep levels of cynicism towards politicians in general , although 51 per cent of respondents said they trusted their local mp			1
a major poll has confirmed the image that most mps are only in politics to line their own pockets public confidence in elected representatives has been declining in recent years , and is markedly lower than in similar surveys in 2004 and 2006			1
but it has recovered slightly since its low point in 2009 during the @entity31 ’ expenses scandal , when 76 per cent of those questioned did not trust mps to tell the truth			0
now 72 per cent concur – up from 60 per cent in 2006 – while 21 per cent said they did trust them to be honest			0
as to what the priorities of @entity31 are , half of the @entity46 public ( 52 per cent ) believe they put their own interests first , and 31 per cent say that they put their party first			1
only one in 12 ( 8 per cent ) believe mps put the interests of their own constituents first , and 6 per cent said their country comes first for mps			2
half of the @entity46 public believe mps put their own interests first , according to a new @entity23 survey unfortunately this is almost the exact opposite of what people want mps to prioritise , with 56 per cent saying they want them to put their country first while 40 per cent want the constituent put first			1
supporters of the @entity46 @entity68 were more likely than other party supporters to think mps put their own interests first ( 72 per cent ) , to not trust mps in general or their local mp , and were also most dissatisfied with the three main party leaders			2
@entity73 , head of political research at @entity23 , said : ‘ public cynicism with politics is nothing new , but it looks like it has become entrenched			2
‘ disenchantment with politicians is shared across supporters of all parties – but is noticeably higher among @entity68 voters , who seem most unhappy with the current political scene			0
