by @entity0 their faces painted red with crimson ochre and impressive set of brightly coloured feathers swaying on the top of their heads , these @entity2 dancers wear elaborate headdresses beautiful enough to put the efforts of the @entity13 crowd to shame			1
living in @entity15 's magnificent @entity14 , a place of towering escarpments , flamingo - filled soda lakes and abundant wildlife , the @entity2 are one of the country 's most fascinating tribes , famous for their incredible jewellery and interesting customs			1
and the feather headdresses are symbolic of one particularly important tradition , according to photographer @entity26			0
' the guys who wear feather headdresses have just been circumcised , ' he explains			2
' they are n't allowed to meet women			0
' spectacular : these @entity2 men are recently circumcised , a fact made plain by their elaborate feathered headdresses , and can not spend time with women no comparison : @entity13 goer @entity37 might look pretty in her feathered headdress but its not quite as impressive as the ones belonging to the @entity2 what 's more , the feather - wearing men are n't the only ones to be banned from enjoying female company			1
the @entity45 , as the @entity2 are known among themselves , live in one of the world 's only remaining gerontocracies , with the power of the tribal elders underpinned by a belief in their ability to lay curses on miscreants			0
as a result , they monopolise tribal business , including making arrangements for marriages			0
with many choosing to take extra wives themselves at the expense of younger men , the elders ' rule is n't always popular			0
discontent occasionally spills over into discord , with cattle stealing and wife - pinching popular pastimes among the @entity2 's bachelor groups forced to live without families			0
while the odd bout of social strife might make headlines in the local press , abroad , the @entity2 are more famous for their beautiful jewellery and have some interesting customs when it comes to choosing what to wear			2
striking : a pair of @entity2 men show off their elaborate headdresses , created from a mixture of beads , polished ostrich shell and feathers important : while men wear these impressive feathered headpieces , they are not allowed anywhere near women - an occasional source of conflict looking good : @entity2 tribesmen show off their impressively large beaded collars and ostrich feather and egg shell headpieces colourful : along with elaborate feather headdresses , @entity2 and their close kin , the @entity103 , also wear piles of bright beaded jewellery made by the women colourful : a man paints his face with make - up - a habit that led to the @entity2 tribe being given their name which translates from @entity114 as ' butterfly ' wonderful : a @entity2 man shows off his bright saffron sarong and elaborate jewellery ( left ) and right , a @entity2 man silhouetted by the setting sun striking : a @entity2 man shows off his heavy headdress weighted down with scores beads and feathers , and huge , elaborately decorated collar until recently , discarding the traditional tribal loincloth in favour of @entity129 - style trousers was considered unmanly and as a result , the majority of @entity2 men still wear colourful tartan shukkas as they go about their business			1
like their close relations , the @entity138 tribe , the men of both @entity2 and @entity103 tribes also pile on impressive amounts of jewellery , with beaded necklaces , elaborate headdresses and stacks of brightly coloured bracelets all popular			1
women too wear huge amounts of jewellery , most famously their ornate beaded collars , and make most of the jewellery , including their menfolks ' , by hand			2
along with the men , they also paint their faces using concoctions made from ground chalk and ochre and use it to accentuate their best features - much to the delight of nearby tribes who gave the @entity2 their name , which translates from the @entity165 language , @entity114 , as ' butterfly '			1
handmade : all of the headdresses and jewellery worn by @entity2 and @entity103 men are made by the women of the tribe hard work : most of the elaborate beaded adornments take hours of work to complete , although the traditional collars worn by women take almost as long looking good : a @entity2 man checks his crimson make - up in an incongruous pink hand mirror , as he gets ready to participate in a traditional circumcision ritual tradition : the @entity2 's feathered headdresses are better than anything found at @entity13 , and right , men use ochre to dye their hair red stylish : men in traditional clothes , including saffron yellow tunics , a vast beaded collar and polished ostrich shell earrings ritual : the beaded headdresses show that the men are going through a traditional circumcision ritual - and can not be in female company each june , @entity198 plays host to a unique gathering of tribes , with the @entity2 , @entity138 and @entity202 among those to join the @entity198 in showing off their culture to visitors			1

@entity208 ( kenya - airways.com ) operates daily overnight flights from @entity210 to @entity211 from Â£ 732.41			0
for more on @entity15 , see @entity212 but the @entity138 too have no shortage of spectacular jewellery - in particular the incredible enkuraru headdresses crafted from ostrich feathers and worn by warriors yet to kill their first lion			1
originally created for use during raids and wars , thanks to the psychological advantage offered by their height , most are now worn purely for major ceremonies and dances			0
other @entity15 tribes to make the most of the abundance of feathers to be found are the @entity198 and the @entity232 - both of whom live in the arid northwestern reaches of the @entity14			1
the @entity198 , whose lands border those of the @entity202 people and the @entity242 @entity241 tribe , are famous for their athletic prowess and for their beautiful women - among them @entity248 model @entity247			2
less colourful than the @entity2 and the @entity138 , the tribe is nevertheless fond of elaborately decorated clothing , with women wearing stunning animal skin tunics embroidered with polished ostrich shell			0
men , meanwhile , brighten up their look using crimson dye made from local ochre rocks to colour their hair , and like the throng of people heading to @entity13 , pile on huge amounts of bright beaded jewellery			0
but while the @entity13 crowds ' embrace of headdresses and piles of jewellery only lasts four days , for the @entity198 , @entity2 , @entity138 and @entity232 , gorgeous festival - style jewels are a year - round sight			2
spectacular : a pair of @entity2 men look on as the circumcision ceremony gets underway , while right , a man shows off his wonderful beaded headdress striking : a man holds a crimson dyed flag that matches the scarlet make - up on his face as the @entity2 circumcision ceremony gets under way impressive : the men ululate and dance wildly as one of their number plays a flute made from a polished and hollowed out cow horn ensemble : in addition to their amazing headdresses , @entity2 and @entity103 men also wear striking striped socks and beautifully embroidered kikoy wraps sunset : the circumcision celebration continues all day , only finishing at sunset			1
both @entity2 and @entity103 men are involved in the ritual meet the neighbours : the tribes of the @entity14 share their home with an incredible array of wildlife , among them big cats such as lions and in this case , cheetahs adorable : joining the cheetahs , lions and humans of the @entity14 ( and providing supper for all three ) are antelopes , among them the tiny dik dik ( pictured )			2

the @entity2 , @entity138 and @entity103 tribes of @entity15 are famous for their elaborate feather headpieces
@entity2 men wear their headpieces after being circumcised but take them off when they marry
their neighbours include the @entity202 , who live on the @entity242 border , and the @entity325 who live in the north
@entity138 warriors who are yet to kill a lion wear huge enkuraru ostrich feather headdresses for ceremonies
@entity2 men wear theirs with piles of beads and paint their faces with ochre and chalk make - up
the @entity2 , @entity138 and @entity103 live in northwestern @entity15 in and around the dramatic @entity14
