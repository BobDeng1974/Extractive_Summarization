by @entity0 published : 21:11 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 06:51 est , 16 december 2012 a simple sign outside @entity2 declares warmly : ‘ visitors welcome			1
’ it was put up long before the school decided this year , in a flurry of concern about security , to lock all external doors to the outside world at 9.30am every morning			1
not that @entity11 took any notice of the new protocol on friday			1
police say he ‘ forced his way ’ across the threshold , apparently smashing a glass door			2
inside , 575 children aged from five to ten were excitedly preparing for a day of christmas - themed activities			2
from where he left his car to their classrooms is roughly 100 yards , and he covered the ground quickly			2
before he could reach the children he first had to negotiate the entrance , and the staff sitting in meetings in rooms leading off it			0
in the normal way , they would not have been unduly disturbed by his appearance ; many knew him as the ‘ mild - mannered ’ son of popular supply teacher @entity2			1
but on this occasion he was carrying four semi-automatic pistols , among them a @entity49 and a 9mm @entity51			0
and as soon as he set foot inside the foyer he began firing			0
by 9.35am the worst school massacre in @entity56 history was over			1
in all , the shooting had lasted barely three minutes , but it left 20 children and six teachers and school staff dead			1
9.32am : @entity11 arrives at @entity2 in @entity25 , @entity26 , where his mother works and forced his way in when the children had begun filing into school on friday , @entity11 had already murdered his mother at their four - bedroom home five miles away on hilly @entity66 , @entity25			1
@entity2 is also thought to have been shot			1
afterwards , @entity11 took the keys to her black @entity68 and packed a .223 - calibre bushmaster rifle , often favoured by snipers , and the four pistols in the boot before driving to the school			1
he set off at about 9.10am			2
in the event , for unknown reasons , he left the rifle in the car when he reached @entity2			1
once inside the main building , he cut down all who crossed his path , shooting them , said surviving staff , ‘ execution style ’ from close range			0
at first , witnesses reported hearing a ‘ pop pop pop ’ sound from a hallway near classroom number nine			0
9.35am : the shooting stops at the @entity2 after only three minutes principal @entity2 , 47 , and school psychologist @entity2 , who were in a meeting in a room just off the main foyer , bravely went to investigate			1
others simply hid under desks			0
probably known to @entity99 , mrs @entity98 had provided succour to generations of children , but at 56 was due to retire in a few months			0
he shot her dead without saying a word			0
in fact , he said nothing throughout the killing spree			0
next , he turned his gun on mrs @entity110 , a widely admired leader and inspirational teacher			2
the two women – described as the ‘ very soul of our school ’ – were later found lying over each other in a pool of blood			2
within seconds the first call to the emergency services was made by an unidentified female member of staff			0
after bursting through the door of a kindergarten class , @entity11 , in an act of unimaginable horror , began executing child after child			1
9.45am : armed police surround the school as the first swat team arrives on the scene youngsters hid in cupboards , barricaded themselves in toilets and huddled together in nooks and crannies as far from the shooting as they could reach			2
after @entity11 wiped out one class , he moved on to the one next door			1
there he did the same before turning the gun on himself			0
by 9.45am , when the first swat team arrived , the shooting had been over for several minutes , though terrified children and teachers were still in hiding and had to be coaxed out by police			0
one teacher , @entity147 , 50 , was praised by parents for saving the lives of 15 children by hiding them in a closet			2
outside , officers swarmed with dogs and roared overhead in helicopters			0
there were armoured cars and ambulances and , at nearby @entity159 , doctors and nurses braced themselves for an onslaught of wounded victims			0
but such was @entity11 ’s brutal efficiency that the influx never came			1
only three people were admitted to hospital			0
two of them died , a third was said to be doing well last night			0
10.20am : teacher @entity147 who saved the lives of 15 children by hiding them in a closet while @entity11 went on his rampage , leads them to safety			1

@entity11 , 20 , killed his mother at their home in @entity25 , @entity26
he used her car , *loaded* with guns , to drive to @entity2 where his mother worked as a supply teacher at 9.10am on friday morning
by 9.30am , the worst school massacre in @entity56 history was over
