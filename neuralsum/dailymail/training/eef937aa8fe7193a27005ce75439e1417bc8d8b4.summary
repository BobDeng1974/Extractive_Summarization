seven government departments , including the @entity12 and the @entity13 , increased their headcount in the three months to march , despite the austerity drive in @entity16			1
figures compiled by the @entity19 ’ @entity17 revealed wide variations , with @entity21 energy secretary @entity21 overseeing the largest recruitment drive and conservative defence secretary @entity23 cutting the largest number of bureaucrats			2
promises : prime minister @entity27 , who vowed to slim down the civil service , visited @entity30 's @entity29 this morning they cast doubt on the determination of some ministers to implement @entity27 ’s promise to create a ‘ leaner , swifter ’ @entity36			2
by 2015 , the @entity3 says it will have reduced the size of the @entity16 machine by 23 per cent			1
amid frustration at the top of the government at the pace of reform in some areas , cabinet office minister @entity39 yesterday set out provocative plans to examine a further , far - reaching shake - up of the @entity16 machine			2
independent experts will be commissioned to examine whether procedures adopted in other countries – such as forcing senior civil servants to offer their resignation when a new government is elected , or putting them on strict contracts meaning they can be dismissed if they do not reach targets set by ministers – should be copied here			0
according to the @entity19 ’ @entity17 report , staff numbers at the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) rose by 4 per cent from 2,816 to 2,929 between last december and march this year			1
up : employees leave the @entity12 in @entity16 , one of the departments that has increased its headcount though chancellor @entity65 is leading the drive to rein in the public sector , the @entity12 was among the departments to increase its workforce over the first quarter of this year , with numbers rising by 2 per cent to 1,297			1
the @entity13 , which is responsible for increasing government efficiency and @entity36 reform , increased its headcount of staff by 3 per cent to 2,097			1
other ministries to have increased the headcount of officials over the three - month period were the @entity80 , the @entity81 , the @entity82 , and the @entity83			1
at the @entity89 , by contrast , the total headcount of civil servants , excluding members of the @entity87 , fell by 5 per cent between december and april from 57,210 to 54,250 , according to the analysis of official figures			0
@entity92 , of the @entity19 ’ @entity17 , said : ‘ when the government is supposed to be making vital reductions to the size of the public sector , it beggars belief that there are departments which have been increasing the number of @entity16 bureaucrats they employ			1
row : campaigners claim @entity21 ' is letting down cabinet colleagues ' by not controlling staff numbers in his department ‘ ministers increasing staff numbers at departments like @entity109 and @entity110 are letting down their more responsible colleagues			2
‘ every government department needs to work to cut the size of the @entity36 and ease the pressure on taxpayers and the frontline services on which people rely the most			0
’ a spokesman for @entity60 , which @entity120 created in 2008 , suggested its staffing increase was explained by it being ‘ a relatively new department ’			1
‘ the department has a challenging and important agenda as set out in the spending review and posts that have been filled over the last months are necessary to enable us to meet those targets , ’ he added			2
a @entity13 spokesman said : ‘ the number of civil servants is down 7,000 over the quarter and 43,000 over the last 12 months			0
overall , @entity36 employment stands at 428,000 – a new @entity133 low , and down from around half a million in may 2010			0
‘ the small increase in the @entity13 was due to staff transferring across from the @entity136 and , as these are not new civil servants , did not cost the taxpayer anything extra			0
’ ministers have been frustrated that civil servants can avoid personal responsibility for policy failures by arguing that ministers , not officials , are accountable to @entity146 for everything that happens in their department			0
a ministerial source said : ‘ every option is on the table			0
