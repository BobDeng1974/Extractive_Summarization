last week she was unveiling her new clothing collection for @entity2 in @entity3 and today she 's modelling her summer range , so is @entity7 @entity6 's most successful export ? it would appear so			1
the beautician - turned - designer , who found fame on @entity9 , became a millionaire thanks to her burgeoning brand - and there 's just no stopping her			1
speaking to @entity14 about her chic new range of springtime skater dresses , peplums , strappy tops , and feminine blouses , @entity7 , 23 , said : ' i ’ve really branched out for @entity21			1
' i wanted to give more options for all the girls out there who are going on holiday , going out , going to a lovely spring wedding - all of those things			0
i always sit down and think about what everyone wants in a collection , i look on twitter , ask my friends and my mum and look at trends			0
it ’s a long process but i love it			2
' @entity7 has certainly been shaking things up in the wardrobe department and says while she believes people sometimes see her as one dimensional , she says that behind closed doors she 'd love to go wild with her style			1
' i ’d love to be a style chameleon , ' she said			0
' i ’m always looking in magazines at celebrity style and campaign shots			0
i style my friends sometimes and they style me ; i love trying new things			0
' @entity7 says that she wanted to give the ' lovely ladies ' something to dress up in that updated their wardrobe but also flatters and admits she 's been thinking long and hard about her new designs while her former @entity9 co-stars do support her fashion career , @entity7 has her sights set on @entity64 and would love to dress @entity65 and @entity66 in her designs despite her successes , @entity7 still believes that , like @entity70 , it 's difficult to be taken seriously as a designer after finding fame in another industry			1
' i ’ve tried hard to break out of that @entity9 box and i think i ’ve done that , ' she said			1
' i was only on there for two seasons but people instantly pigeon hole you as " @entity6 " , but that ’s not what i ’m about and my collection is for everyone ; i do n’t just design for @entity9 fans			1
' while her former co-stars do support her fashion career , @entity7 has her sights set on @entity64			1
' i ’d love to dress @entity66 , ' she admitted			1
' she ’s so stunning			0
she has such striking features that she can really have fun with her fashion and still look elegant			0
@entity65 is another one - she has such amazing curves and is so stunning			1
i would love to have her in one of my dresses ; she would look amazing			2
' @entity7 believes that , like @entity70 , it 's difficult to be taken seriously as a designer after finding fame in another industry @entity7 loves looking at celebrity style and campaign shots for design inspiration and loves to style her friends for now , @entity7 will be donning her own designs as she jets off on holiday with friends for some ' sun , sea and sangria '			2
' i ’m really looking forward to relaxing somewhere sunny with friends – i spend most of the year being businesswoman @entity7 so it ’ll be nice to kick back and just be fun @entity7 , ' she said			2
' i go on holiday with my best friend usually ; i would love to share it with someone special though , maybe in the future ? , ' she teased			0
she does , however , admit that men ' definitely ' struggle to approach her because of who she is			0
she said : ' some of my guy friends say they ’ve heard that guys have not come and said " hi " to me as they were intimidated			0
i do n’t get it though			0
' so what kind of relationship is @entity7 looking for ? ' one like the @entity123 ' , ' she said			1
' they have their own businesses and things going on yet they still make time for each other to be a family			0
that ’s the perfect relationship : still doing what you love and having that person to come home to			2
' @entity7 will be donning her own designs as she jets off on holiday with friends for some ' sun , sea and sangria '			2
