by @entity0 published : 10:51 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 10:52 est , 24 july 2013 a new species of shrew that @entity4 scientists say has the ' most bizarre mammalian spine on @entity6 ' has been found in equatorial @entity7			1
the miniature @entity8 was discovered by scientists at @entity11 's @entity10 who examined its spine , which has been an enigma to evolutionary biologists			1
the interlocking vertebrae of the @entity8 render its spine four to five times more robust relative to body mass - a condition not found in any other mammal			1
a new species of @entity8 that @entity4 scientists said has the ' most bizarre mammalian spine on @entity6 ' has been found in equatorial @entity7 by scientists at @entity11 's @entity10 the new species of the @entity8 is named @entity22 and possesses features that might represent intermediate character states between the only other known @entity8 species ( @entity8 ) , and common shrews			1
the @entity8 was first discovered in 1910 but its most notable feature was not revealed for another seven years , when a specimen was dissected to reveal the most peculiar backbone of any mammal			2
it 's spine is unique as the lower vertebrae have multiple lateral processes that interlock with the processes of neighboring vertebra			1
the arrangement , along with surrounding musculature , affords the animal extraordinary strength , so much so that the @entity8 has traditionally been worn as a talisman			2
@entity40 , director of collections and zoologist at the @entity10 , said : ' this shrew first came to light when explorers came to the eastern part of the @entity47			1
' ' the explorers watched in amazement as a full - grown man stood on the back of the @entity8 , and the animal walked away , unharmed			0
' the spine of the first species of hero shrew to be discovered ( labelled b ) is much stronger than the common shrew 's backbone , labelled a the newly discovered @entity8 's spine ( pictured ) is unique as the lower vertebrae have multiple lateral processes that interlock with the processes of neighboring vertebra			1
the arrangement , along with surrounding musculature , affords the animal extraordinary strength until now , there have been no other species of this bizarre shrew			0
the new species described in this study represents a possible intermediate between the original @entity8 and other shrews , since is possesses an interlocking spine , but with fewer lower vertebrae and lateral processes than the first @entity8 species			1
humans have five lumbar vertebrae as do most other mammals , but the hero shrew has at least 10			0
mr @entity40 said : ' @entity22 has eight vertebrae , and fewer lateral processes than the original species			0
' the specimen of the new @entity8 was collected in the lowland forest near the @entity86 in the @entity47			2
in their study published in @entity89 , the scientists suggest these shrews position themselves between the trunk and leaf bases of @entity93 and use their unique spine to exert force and gain access to concentrated sources of beetle larvae that are otherwise protected from predation			2
the same adaptation may allow these animals to lift logs or rocks to access invertebrates â€“ a food resource that remains unavailable to many other mammals			0
here are backbones of three types of shew : the standard shrew ( a ) the original @entity8 ( @entity56 ) andthe newly discovered @entity8 ( c )			0
scientists believe the new @entity8 might lift rocks and logs to find grubs the specimen of @entity22 now residing at @entity10 is a holotype , meaning that it will be the standard for identifying other members of the species			1
the new species is named in honor of @entity121 of the @entity122 , at the suggestion of @entity40 , who did his graduate work there			0
the suggested common name is ' @entity22 ' , appropriately invoking @entity127 , the god of strength in @entity129			0
mr @entity40 said : ' @entity130 is not over - in fact , discoveries such as these happen in natural history collections , like the ones that we have at @entity10			0
' in addition , hypotheses such as the one that we 've generated concerning the functional significance of the @entity8 's spine fuel the scientific machine			2
we ca n't wait to see the results of further scientific studies that test the ideas presented in this article			0

a new species of @entity8 with the ' most bizarre mammalian spine on @entity6 ' has been found in the @entity47
@entity11 's @entity10 examined its spine , which has *previously* baffled evolutionary biologists to suggest that the little creature uses it to lift rocks
the unique interlocking vertebrae of the @entity8 render its spine four to five times more robust relative to body mass
