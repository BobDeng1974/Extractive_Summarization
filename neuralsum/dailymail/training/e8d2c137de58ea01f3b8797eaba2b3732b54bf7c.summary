the meeting will be hard for many republicans to stomach , because they see the @entity4 as the representative of an occupying country			1
no @entity38 sit in @entity39 because they refuse to take an oath of allegiance to her			0
@entity43 , who was injured in the 1984 @entity45 bomb which left his wife @entity46 in a wheelchair , said he hoped the meeting showed that @entity14 was starting to ‘ repent ’			1
concerns : @entity14 president @entity50 said the decision would ' understandably cause difficulties for some republicans and nationalists ' he said : ‘ i ’m glad that mr @entity1 is moving to finally acknowledge that the @entity4 is sovereign over @entity9 and i hope it ’s another step on his way towards confessing and repenting for the crimes of @entity2 / @entity14			1
’ @entity1 ( pictured in the early 70s ) has faced repeated questions over his @entity2 past which stretched back to the 1970s			2
he joined the @entity2 as a teenager and quickly rose up the ranks			2
by 1971 , aged 21 , he was second in command of the @entity2 in @entity62			2
he held that position at the time of @entity65 , when 14 civil rights protesters were killed by @entity68 paratroopers in the city			0
during the @entity71 into the events of that day , @entity70 claimed @entity1 had personally handed him bomb parts , an allegation @entity1 claimed was ' fantasy '			0
in 1973 , he was convicted by @entity9 's @entity76 , after being caught with a car loaded with explosives and ammunition			0
he refused to recognise the court , and was sentenced to six months imprisonment			0

he has always denied those allegations			0
however , he has never denied his role in the @entity2 , saying in september last year : ‘ i did n’t say i never fired a gun – i was in the @entity2			2
there were battles on the streets of @entity62			0
' however , when asked if he had killed anyone , he answered no. he claims he left the @entity91 in 1974 to pursue a career in politics			0
@entity95 backbencher @entity94 said : ‘ it shows the kind of person the @entity4 is if she is willing to meet someone who has a horrendous past of engaging in and encouraging terrorism			1
the deputy first minister was part of an organisation that murdered a member of her own family and many of her subjects			0
‘ her visit to @entity9 last year was a truly historic occasion and this move by @entity14 shows that even the most republican people in @entity9 are willing to move forward			2
‘ and by meeting her , @entity1 is accepting that the @entity4 is queen of @entity9			2
’ @entity14 leaders agreed to the meeting at a four - hour conference in @entity116 of the party ’s ruling council , the @entity119			1
@entity121 president @entity50 described the decision as a ‘ symbolic and significant step ’ taken after consulting with grass roots support			1

‘ but it ’s good for @entity130			0
it ’s good for this process we ’re trying to develop			0
‘ after @entity1 completes this engagement he will be as true , as staunch , as active a republican as he ever was			0
’ @entity137 border charity @entity130 is to host an event for the @entity4 and @entity140 president @entity139 to celebrate the arts and culture across the island			1
this will provide the backdrop for the meeting with mr @entity1			0
mr @entity1 , the @entity2 ’s second in command in @entity62 at the time of @entity65 , was always the candidate to shake the @entity4 ’s hand but delicate talks have been going on for months to arrange a suitable venue and occasion			1
@entity14 boycotted the @entity4 ’s successful state visit to the @entity140 last year			1
but the @entity4 made a series of gestures which were seen as a dramatic advance in @entity159 relations – including speaking in @entity140 at a banquet in her honour			2
@entity14 was criticised for failing to be involved , but mr @entity1 has since spoken of how he was struck by what the @entity4 did			1
last night , @entity163 , a victim of an @entity2 bomb attack in @entity165 in 1993 said she was shocked by news of the meeting			2
she said : ‘ i still think of @entity1 as a terrorist and that will never change			0
