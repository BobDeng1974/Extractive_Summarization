by @entity0 published : 22:29 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 16:08 est , 23 august 2012 @entity2 stores have long been regarded as modern bastions of technology staffed with sharp young problem - solvers eager to help a customer in need , but according to a shocking new exposé , all is not as it seems			1
a tell - all article has blown the lid off the dirty secrets of one @entity13 at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
among the allegations was a manager trading heavily discounted @entity2 products to a plastic surgeon in return for a stomach - stapling procedure			1
@entity23 : the @entity24 in @entity15 has been identified as the location in an explosive expose according to @entity29 magazine , which interviewed two former so - called ' @entity2 employees , identified as ' @entity31 ' and ' @entity32 ' , behind - the - scenes at the store was a hotbed of corruption , drunkenness and out - of - control antics			1
the former employees said that the regional corporate manager ran the store as if it was her personal playground			2
‘ she was notorious for pulling favors for businesses in the community who did n't want to play by @entity2 's rules , ’ @entity31 told @entity29			0
‘ she made quid pro quo an art. ’ eventually , the female manager was ousted for reportedly ‘ unfair hiring practices , ’ playing favorites , and ' questionable activities surrounding use of store services '			2
dark side : former members of the genius squad revealed that if customers were rude to them , they would get back at them by breaking their hardware but management were not the only ones breaking the rules			0
@entity32 admitted that he and his co-workers on the genius squad would shamelessly exploit @entity2 ’s once lax return and exchange policy to get new phones whenever they pleased by making false transactions			1
sales queen : ex-workers claimed that one regional manager sold computers at a sharp discounter to a plastic surgeon in exchange for a stomach stapling procedure ‘ it bends my brain to know that , statistically speaking , it 's harder to get a job at the @entity13 than it is to get into some @entity83 schools , ’ @entity31 said			1
‘ yet somehow they 're staffed by some of the most inept people this side of mastering the ability to speak			0
’ sometimes they would purposely smash their iphones at alcohol - fueled parties just to see how many replacements they could squeeze out of the @entity2 stockroom			2
but it was not just the off - site parties where the booze flowed freely			2
‘ it 's not uncommon for the genius team to be drunk , ’ @entity31 noted , adding that @entity2 employees working the night shift at a call center in a nearby town would routinely do cocaine on the job			0
beside exploiting their company ’s policies to score free hardware and working while inebriated , @entity31 and @entity32 have revealed that members of the genius squad would get back at particularly rude or annoying costumers by destroying their devices , simply because they were being ' a * * * * * * * '			0
‘ @entity113 used someone else 's hard drive as a skateboard cause he told the store i smelled , ’ @entity32 said in a text message			0
and there was little the customers could do about their damaged property because the employees would give them a form to sign according to which they were not responsible for data loss			0
sign of contempt : the workers at the @entity15 store created a shrine to the whining customers in a back room in a supreme expression of contempt for @entity2 clientele , some of the geniuses at the @entity14 location even built a shrine in a back room to whining customers			1
@entity29 has reported that since releasing the expose , several other former workers of the @entity15 store , identified by the @entity144 , have come forward to corroborate the claims made by @entity31 and @entity32 , who are no longer employed by @entity2			1
others , however , were quick to point out that the examples of irresponsible behavior cited in the article were an exception to the rule , and that most @entity2 employees love their job and treat their customers with respect .			0
