it had been expected that the royal baby would be born in the @entity12 of @entity13 in @entity14			1
it is where princess @entity16 gave birth to the @entity3 and prince @entity19			0
but friends of @entity21 have said she and her family want the baby to be born at the @entity24 in @entity25 , where she and her sister @entity26 were born			1
a source told the @entity28 : ' their thinking is that she will be based at her parents ’ house during the later stages of her pregnancy and they do not want her to have to travel miles to @entity14 when she goes into labour			1
' the @entity24 in @entity25 has recently opened a £ 3 million , assisted by @entity36			2
it has been reported that @entity21 intends to live at her parents house in @entity38 for the first six weeks after the birth			1
the baby is due in july			2
@entity21 was treated for severe morning sickness at the private @entity42 , in @entity43			2
during her stay two radio presenters called the hospital pretending to be the @entity47 and prince @entity48			0
@entity49 , the nurse who put through the call through , killed herself days later			0
it is not thought the tragedy has formed part of @entity21 's decision making process			1

the @entity24 in @entity25 , where @entity21 and her sister @entity26 were born it has been reported that @entity21 intends to live at her parents house in @entity38 for the first six weeks after the birth			1
the baby is due in july @entity21 – who is six months pregnant – told guests at a recent reception that she had chosen a buggy by designer label @entity68 , which has celebrity fans including actress @entity71 and television presenter @entity72			1
the buggies , which cost from £ 500 to £ 1,000 and can operate as either a pushchair or pram , come in a variety of colours and parents who do not know the sex of their baby usually prefer neutral hues such as beige , off - white or black			0
the @entity3 and @entity2 have insisted that they do not know if they are having a boy or a girl			0
but although it is possible to swap some of the buggy ’s accessories for those in different colours , including pink , @entity21 ’s choice of blue will be seen as a clear hint as to her feelings about the gender			2
she has said she would prefer a son while @entity98 wants a daughter			0
yesterday , @entity68 said it had not presented the buggy to the royal couple after being advised by officials not to send gifts			0
so it appears that @entity21 , who was seen shopping for a @entity107 basket in @entity108 last week with her mother , bought the pram herself			2
@entity2 , 31 , revealed the @entity68 colour when she chatted to a group of @entity114 wives at a drinks reception in @entity116 on @entity117 .			0

was expected baby would be born in @entity13 , @entity14
but family want @entity21 to give birth at the @entity24 , it 's said
a *spokesman* said *announcement* will be made ' in due course '
