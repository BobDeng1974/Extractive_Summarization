' deeply shocked ' : @entity1 prime minister @entity0 was likened to a quail with ' small breasts , huge thighs and a big red box ' on a menu drawn up by the opposition @entity7 @entity1 prime minister @entity0 was said to be ' deeply shocked ' today by a sexist dinner menu drawn up by the opposition @entity7 in which she was likened to a quail with ' small breasts , huge thighs and a big red box '			1
details of the menu at a fundraising event in @entity15 were revealed after miss @entity0 's warning that if her @entity18 lost the general election in september , the incoming liberals would be ' dominated by men in blue ties ' and women would be given only minor roles			1
but her remarks paled into insignificance with the new row over the dinner menu which former @entity18 prime minister @entity27 described as a ' snide , dirty and sexist trick			1
' former @entity7 government minister @entity29 who was involved with organising the dinner apologised for what he said was a ' deeply offensive and sexist description ' of the prime minister			1
political observers said the dinner menu 's contents had blunted the @entity7 's attack on miss @entity0 's campaign to warn about about the threat of male dominance in government if the @entity42 won the election , as the opinion polls are suggesting			1
the dinner menu made its unsubtle attack on @entity47 - born miss @entity0 under the title of @entity49			2
it described the dish as : ' @entity52 , @entity53 and a @entity54			0
' mr @entity27 , the former @entity18 prime minister who was pushed aside by @entity56 in a party room coup in june 2010 but who is rumoured to be planning a fight - back for the top job , was also targeted on the menu			2
his name was linked to a dish called ' @entity27 's a @entity64			0
' hitting out today , mr @entity27 , who by coincidence was wearing a bright blue tie , savaged mr @entity29 for the stunt			0
' he 's a former minister in the @entity70 government , number two he 's a highly experienced politician , number three he organised the fundraiser which used all these menus , four it was n't a mistake - he knew it was being used - five he 's apologised because he 's been found out , ' said mr @entity27			2
stunt : the @entity42 have apologised for the reference to miss @entity0 on the fundraiser menu ( above ) furious : former @entity18 prime minister @entity27 ( right ) , who was also targeted n the menu , described the stunt as a ' snide , dirty and sexist trick ' he suggested that every dollar raised at the fundraising event should now be donated to the @entity86 as a mark of contrition			1
liberal leader @entity89 was also quick to condemn the menu , calling it ' tawdry '			0
' i think we should all be bigger and better than that , ' he said			0
mr @entity27 is being regularly touted as the man preparing himself to challenge miss @entity0 for the @entity18 leadership and get his old job back as prime minister before the september election			1
he has constantly denied the rumours and he insisted that his decision to wear a blue tie just 24 hours after miss @entity0 had spoken out against ' men in blue ties ' was not a declaration of war on miss @entity0			2
' like most blokes in the country , i have no sense of fashion , ' he said			0
he said he relied on his wife @entity109 and daughter @entity109 to choose his ties and ' this was the one packed for this particular occasion			0
' if i had to get ride of all my blue ties i 'd lose about a third of them			0

@entity18 prime minister said to be ' deeply shocked ' by @entity7 stunt
comes after miss @entity0 claimed government would be dominated by men if @entity42 won power
organisers apologise for using ' deeply offensive and sexist description '
