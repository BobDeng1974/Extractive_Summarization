ultimately , @entity0 were never destined to become the first @entity2 club to win promotion this season at @entity5 , even though they are inching ever closer			1
@entity7 ’s win over @entity8 meant @entity9 will have to wait until tuesday to finish the job of returning to the @entity11 , but almost as importantly they made sure @entity13 would n’t make any ground on them in the top two			1
three points at @entity17 on tuesday will do the trick - only that standing in their way now			2
it would take something to go seriously awry for the @entity22 not to be returning to the second tier after a two - year absence , and they did their job well enough to prevent any late scares in the north west			2
@entity0 striker @entity29 celebrates his 63rd minute goal against @entity13 at @entity5 @entity13 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 ; @entity35 ( @entity36 84 ) , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ; @entity41 ( @entity42 90 ) , @entity43 ( @entity44 84 ) subs not used : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 @entity0 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 90 ) , @entity59 ; @entity60 ( @entity61 82 ) , @entity29 subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 a six - minute rendition of ‘ f * * * off @entity7 , you are staying down ’ rang out of the gleeful away end at @entity5 - populated by 2,400 - as that return got ever closer			1
@entity0 had dispensed of their rivals on tuesday night , hammering them 3 - 0 , and took great delight in revelling in their triumph			1
it was an afternoon whereby neither side played with any nerves - there are reasons why these two occupy the automatic promotion places - although lacking a fluidity you would perhaps expect			1
there was an illusion of this being an open game , but the two five - man midfields shattered that			0
@entity41 came closest for the hosts , his smart overhead kick just flying wide , while the out of sorts @entity38 blasted way over			1
@entity43 felt he should ’ve been awarded a penalty after being clattered by @entity50			0
@entity9 , knowing results elsewhere dictated they could still clinch elevation by five o’clock , clearly put a rocket up his free scorers at the break			0
before then they had threatened from free - kicks , managed to get into decent positions , but did n’t threaten nearly enough			0
@entity29 got on the end of @entity54 ’s wicked cross from the right , but his shot was superbly tipped onto the bar by @entity107			1
@entity60 failed to stretch far enough to convert from two yards shortly afterwards			0
@entity13 were on the ropes , their biggest crowd in two years growing restless immediately after half - time			1
that was until @entity41 popped up , five yards out , to send @entity5 delirious just before the hour mark			2
@entity39 picked up on lapse defending to take control of the situation inside the away box , firing across goal for @entity41 to sweep beyond @entity50			2
at that stage , it took @entity121 ’s side seven points ahead of @entity123 - drawing at @entity124 - in third			2
but they only managed to hold the lead for four minutes , @entity125 intelligently flicking a header towards the middle of the six - yard box for @entity29 to power home in front of the travelling band from the @entity134 , his 20th of the season			1
@entity121 will be frustrated at the way in which his side switched off from a routine set piece			0
this could ’ve been a day they made the title race very interesting indeed			0
as it was , @entity60 forced @entity31 into another decent save , diving down to his right to tip wide on the angle , as @entity9 ’s side searched for a winner			0
that did not come , despite substitute @entity149 ’ best efforts			0
the ice is stored away , but not for long .			0

second - placed @entity13 hosted @entity154 leaders @entity0
@entity41 fired the home side into the lead in the 59th minute
@entity29 *equalised* for @entity0 four minutes later
