@entity1 ’s sense of injustice over @entity4 ’s red card has been heightened by their view @entity6 was the victim of a headbutt from @entity9 ’s @entity8			1
manager @entity10 made the peculiar claim on saturday night that @entity4 ’s foul on @entity13 was no worse than some committed by their opponents			2
however , it was an alleged incident between @entity6 and @entity8 that most infuriated @entity1 as the full back , 19 , was left with a black eye			2
last night the @entity19 had no record of a complaint and they will find out today if there is anything in referee @entity25 ’s report			0
@entity1 's @entity4 takes down @entity13 of @entity9 and receives a red card @entity1 striker @entity4 , centre , is shown a red card by referee @entity25 defender @entity6 made his first start for @entity1 since his £ 30m summer move from @entity31 @entity9 's @entity8 is booked for an innocuous challenge on @entity1 defender @entity6 @entity6 was also critical of the decision to send off @entity4			1
‘ we have had a lot of bad luck , especially with @entity4 ’s red card , as there was a handball but the referee did n’t stop play , ’ said @entity6			0
‘ and earlier in the game , @entity8 did the same to me			0

@entity6 *believes* the decision to send off @entity4 was harsh
the left *-* back also maintains that @entity8 *produced* as bad a challenge on him than @entity4 done to @entity13
@entity1 boss @entity10 also claimed that @entity4 's foul on @entity13 was no worse than some fouls committed by @entity9 players
@entity6 was reportedly left with a black eye following a alleged headbutt by @entity8 which the @entity19 may now decide to *investigate* into
@entity6 made his first start for @entity1 against the @entity9 since *joining* for £ *30million* from @entity31 in the summer
