@entity0 is the best player i ’ve ever seen in the flesh and he has helped drag this @entity5 team to the final			1
but it ’s still difficult to watch the player he is now , compared to the one he was three or four years ago			1
i do n’t buy the theory that he is better because he ’s evolving			0
go and watch highlights of his peak years at @entity13 and he was absolutely electric			0
that pace and speed off the mark have gone			0
but for all that , he is still the main man and if @entity5 are to win this @entity20 , you have to look at @entity0			1
on his back : @entity0 may not be the player he was but he 's carried @entity5 to the @entity20 final easing the burden : @entity25 should play if he 's fit - he 's an asset to @entity0 coach @entity27 has a decision to make over @entity25			1
if he has had no injury reaction , he should play because he makes @entity0 a better player			1
in @entity32 , the @entity31 have an arch predator , and @entity34 is such a good all - round player			2
i do n’t expect them to change their line - up			1
@entity38 @entity39 have a huge advantage here			1
@entity41 may have been the semi-final shootout hero but @entity43 could go down as one of the best goalkeepers we ’ve ever seen			1
he ’s a great shot - stopper , commands his area better than anybody and is fantastic on the ball			2
you could see how angry he was about conceding against @entity52 and that tells you everything about him			0
@entity41 has been solid , but @entity43 ’s the real deal			2
real deal : @entity39 keeper @entity43 has been outstanding throughout the tournament hero : @entity41 may have starred for @entity5 in their shootout win over @entity61 but lacks @entity43 's class will rojo @entity63 ? neither side is magnificent at the back , though @entity5 have improved as the tournament has gone on			1
i was not a @entity69 fan , but he did very well to marshal @entity70 and @entity71			0
partner @entity72 is a real warrior and @entity73 is excellent at right back , though there are question marks over @entity76			0
the @entity31 are slightly better and i would not be surprised to see @entity77 in the @entity78 soon			0
top class : @entity5 right - back @entity73 is excellent but there are question marks over @entity76 steady : @entity39 fare slightly better at the back , while @entity77 could excel in the @entity78 @entity82 too often looks like a last - ditch defender , something you ca n’t say about @entity86			1
@entity87 has done well , too , and overall the @entity31 have a better unit			0
@entity5 ’s @entity89 this is the weakest area of the @entity5 side			2
@entity92 is trying to do everything : tackling , passing , creating			2
he ’s a fine player but a destroyer , not a playmaker			0
the lack of creativity in the middle is one of the reasons we have n’t seen @entity0 at his peak			2
he ’s been good but at @entity13 , with quick passes from @entity103 and @entity104 , he ’s even better			0
too much : @entity5 's hard man @entity92 is trying to be their playmaker to his team 's detriment what he does best : @entity92 blocks @entity61 star @entity70 's shot late in the semi-final @entity5 will have to pass the ball quickly or @entity39 will swarm all over them			1
@entity39 have so many midfield options			0
@entity117 was excellent against @entity52 and , though his inclusion over @entity119 is not one for the purists , he has improved the balance .			0

@entity0 is the world 's best but not as good as he was three or four years ago
@entity25 eases the *significant* burden on @entity0 when he 's on the pitch
@entity39 is *n't* likely to change their line - up from the semi-final
keeper @entity43 gives @entity39 a huge advantage in terms of class
neither team is great at the back , but @entity5 has improved
@entity5 's weakest link is the *pressure* they place on destroyer @entity92 to be a play maker
