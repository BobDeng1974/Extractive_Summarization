by @entity0 forget life on @entity2			1
the search for aliens is underway … in @entity5			0
scientists are scouring @entity8 ’s deepest mine for bugs able to survive in the extreme conditions of the red planet			1
the four - year probe could tell us what to look for on @entity2 – and where to find it			1
scientists are looking for life on @entity2 by determining whether deep subsurface microbes found at @entity20 might one day be found on the red planet			1
this picture shows @entity23 , professor of astrobiology at @entity25 , ( right ) and phd student @entity26 collecting samples a mile underground it could also provide insight into whether life on @entity32 could have actually started on @entity2 – meaning we are all actually @entity34			1
@entity20 , a working salt and potash mine near @entity37 , is perfect for the project because the salty conditions mimic those on @entity2 which is covered in a layer of table salt			1
the darkness that comes with being more than half a mile down is also key because many scientists believe that any life ‘ on ’ @entity2 is actually lurking deep beneath the surface			1
professor @entity23 , scientific co-ordinator of the £ 2 million ( $ 3.3 million ) @entity48 programme , said : ‘ if we want to successfully explore @entity2 , we need to go to @entity2 - like places on @entity32			2

‘ by looking underground at @entity20 , we get an idea about the habitability and possibility of life on @entity2			1
‘ there is nowhere else in the world with a permanent lab in a salty environment where you can do this kind of science			0
‘ so we have come to @entity5 to understand @entity2			0
’ the @entity25 - funded scientists are sampling pools of brine in the mine for microbes , growing them in the lab and sequencing their dna			0
they also want to know how the sunlight - starved microbes get enough energy to survive and if they can cope with the high level of radiation found on @entity2			2
answers to these questions will shed light on whether bacteria could live on our neighbouring planet – and where to find it			0
for instance , if the sun and oxygen - starved bugs in the mine get their energy from iron and sulphur , the hunt could focus on places with these elements			0
if there is life on @entity2 , scientists will want to know its origins			2
one possibility is that life on @entity32 started on @entity2 and was carried here by microbes buried deep inside a meteorite			1

pictured is technician @entity137 in the underground @entity139 lab @entity140 is located just south - east of the village of @entity20 , on the north - east coast of the @entity143 in @entity144 professor @entity23 said : ‘ there is absolutely no evidence for it but as a highly exploratory thought , you could go to @entity2 and look for @entity2 life and find that we have been @entity34 all along			1
’ if the bacteria at @entity20 can survive the levels of radiation bugs would be exposed to travelling through space , the theory would seem more credible			0
the mine , which has over 500 miles of tunnels under @entity5 and @entity160 and extends seven miles under the sea , is also being used to test scientific instruments which are bound for @entity2			2
the technology could be adapted to improve detection and safety in mines			0
other projects at the @entity168 include the search for dark matter , the invisible ‘ glue ’ that holds the universe together			0
the scientists say the study of other planets helps us better understand life on @entity32			2
the darkness that comes with being more than half a mile down is also key because many scientists believe that any life ' on ' @entity2 is actually lurking deep beneath the surface			1
technician @entity137 is pictured in the underground @entity139 lab the mine , which has over 500 miles of tunnels under @entity5 and @entity160 and extends seven miles under the sea , is also being used to test scientific instruments which are bound for @entity2 and it is essential if we are to understand our place in the universe			0
professor @entity23 , of director of the @entity8 @entity194 at @entity25 , said : ‘ there is a philosophical aspect to this			0
whether we are alone in the universe is a really basic science question			0
‘ you very rarely hear a seven year old ask its parents if they can explain the nitrogen cycle in the forest or the fundamental atomic structure of an atom			0
‘ but seven year olds do go to their parents and ask : “ is there anyone out there ? ”			0
‘ it is a rarity in human nature not to think about whether we are alone			0
that is a very human question			0

scientists are looking for signs of life deep in @entity20 , a mine near @entity37
claim the salty conditions mimic the harsh environment found on @entity2
they hope it will give them an idea of the possibility of life on red planet
it could also provide an insight into whether life on @entity32 could have actually started on @entity2 – meaning we are all actually @entity34
