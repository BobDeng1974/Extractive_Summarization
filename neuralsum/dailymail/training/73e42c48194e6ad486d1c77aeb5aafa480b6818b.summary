plans for a large , @entity2 - only cemetery to be built on a plot of rural land have upset residents , who have publicly objected to the new development			1
people from @entity8 , near @entity9 in the @entity10 , have objected to the ' major development ' , which will include space for 4,000 followers of @entity14 to be buried , and 75 parking spaces for visitors			1
as the latest census figures give the village 's population as just 613 , this means the cemetery could eventually hold six - and - a - half times as many people as @entity8 itself			1
rural : residents of @entity8 , in the @entity10 , have objected to a proposed @entity2 - only cemetery objections : letters submitted to the council say that the plans come too soon after other developments in the rural settlements of @entity9 , the most predominant ethnic group is @entity34 , with all settlements - apart from @entity36 and @entity8 - having a @entity34 population of between 97 per cent and 99 per cent			1
census data from 2001 reveals that of the 11,654 population of the @entity41 ( of which @entity8 is part ) , 37 people registered their religion as @entity2			1
in mid- 2009 , it was estimated that there were 21,500 @entity46 or @entity47 ( @entity48 ) residents in @entity9 , equating to 10.5 per cent of the borough â€™s population compared with 12.5 per cent in @entity52 and 14.4 per cent of the @entity10			1
by 2013 , there were significantly more @entity2 ( +3,610 , 221 per cent ) than in 2001			2
the majority of @entity9 residents describe themselves as @entity56 ( 65.6 per cent ) , with no religion the second largest group ( 21.4 per cent )			2
the @entity60 population represents the largest proportion of @entity48 groups in the rural areas of @entity9 , with the exception of @entity8 , where ' other ' ethnic groups make up the greatest proportion of @entity68 groups			1
the cemetery would be able to comply fully with @entity71 law - which stipulates a method of bathing and shrouding the bodies of @entity2 , before they are buried with their heads facing towards @entity78			2
@entity79 has received several letters of complaint about the plans , which were proposed by @entity83			0
the objections focus on the size of the cemetery , and the decision to place the patch on fertile land in the green belt			0
one letter , from villager @entity92 , 51 , said : ' we are amazed at yet another planning application on this beautiful arable land following the recent dogs ' home planning approval			0
' if further applications are approved then sooner rather than later the whole acreage will be built up			0
' another , from @entity101 , said : ' i must protest vigorously			0
we are not talking about a small parochial cemetery , but a major development that will impact on the traffic system			1
' letters have also been received in support of the venture			0
one , signed by five supporters , said : ' i agree that a @entity2 cemetery would be preferred and beneficial for the @entity2 residents in the borough of @entity9			1
' i would like to confirm the need for a private @entity2 burial ground , which adheres to all @entity14 bereavement values and laws			2
' slow down : one council member said the cemetery was not ' an appropriate development in greenbelt land ' a planning statement from @entity123 said : ' few burial authorities are able to facilitate full @entity2 burials in accordance with the practice of @entity71			1
' @entity128 , a member of the town council , said there is sufficient space already available at the borough 's two main cemeteries			2
he said : ' the issue here is whether there is an over-riding need and i do n't believe there is			0
' ' i do not believe this is an appropriate development in greenbelt land			0
residents who have spoken to me , including the parish council and residents association , have concerns about the design and vehicles access			0
' the access road is a dangerous road and residents have concerns over the increase in traffic this development will cause			0
' dr @entity154 , a @entity9 imam , said : ' we have a growing @entity2 population in @entity9			1
we have also an ageing population and plots are filling up			0
' the nearest @entity2 cemetery is @entity160 and it can be extremely difficult for relatives to visit their loved ones			0

residents of @entity8 , near @entity9 , @entity10 , objected to the huge development after realising it would be for 4,000 people
' major development ' would allow @entity2 to be buried *separately*
council member said ' i do not believe this is an appropriate development '
some have also *written* to @entity9 council in support
