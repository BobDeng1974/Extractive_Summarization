like their namesakes , false killer whales are actually dolphins and not whales			1
but their friendly looks are deceiving , as they attack and eat other cetaceans			0
if you 're happy and you know it ... smiley the false killer whale looks content to be socialising with friends looks can be deceiving : like their namesakes , false killer whales attack and eat other cetaceans growing boy : adult males can grow to nearly 20ft long , weigh up to two tonnes and live for around 60 years adult males can grow to nearly 20ft long , weigh up to two tonnes and live for around 60 years			1
false killer whales typically grow between 16 and 22 large , conical teeth on each jaw			2
they measure around 0.75ins in diameter from the gum line			0
but the population living in waters around @entity23 has plenty of reason not to be so cheerful , having suffered signifant decline over the past 25 years			2

whale of a time : any similarities with the ferocious killer whale are quickly forgotten thanks to his smile in danger : around 400 false killer whales were counted in 1989 but recent studies estimate 150 remain teething : false killer whales typically grow between 16 and 22 large , conical teeth on each of jaw false killer whales usually prefer deep , open water , making the @entity23 population unique as it is the only one known to make it home close to land			1
the decline is partially blamed on tuna and swordfish fishing , with false killer whales being caught unintentionally as by - catch			1
back on land , a bashful bear has been showing the happy go lucky false killer whale a thing or two about modesty			1
the coy cub tried to hide from the camera after a hard day posing for pictures in @entity109 , @entity110			0
camera shy : the bear had been happy to pose for pictures , left , before deciding enough was enough , right gone fishing : the striking animal showed that he is as good a hunter in water as he is on dry land photographer @entity118 , 30 , from @entity119 , who spent the day watching the playful bear , was just metres away when the camera shy bear closed his eyes and covered his face with his paw			2
he said : ' the bear was fishing for red salmon in the lake and after eating a substantial dinner decided to have a rest in the sun. ' i think it was at that point that he decided enough was enough			0
he 'd hardly paid any attention to me all day but once he 'd exhausted himself and filled his belly i guess he just wanted to relax on his own without me taking pictures			0
' i was overwhelmed with different emotions at the time , when i first spotted him i feared for my life but by the end of the day we had become quite close			0
what 's so funny ? this chuckling cheetah looks like he was having a laugh in the hot @entity145 sun ' all of the time i was looking through my viewfinder because i did n't want to miss a shot			0
i guess he just got tired of posing in the end			0
' in @entity151 , @entity145 , a cheeky cheetah grabbed photographer @entity153 's attention as the big cat was spotted chuckling to himself			0
