by @entity0 published : 21:21 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 21:21 est , 22 march 2012 @entity5 is lagging behind @entity6 and @entity7 in the number of road improvements carried out in the last year , a damning new international league - table of highway upgrades and maintenance across @entity4 reveals today analysis across 30 @entity4 countries by map and sat - nav experts @entity14 show that 115,994 new roundabouts , carriageway lanes and one - way streets were created in the @entity5 over the last 12 months			1
but this only places the @entity5 at seventh place in the @entity4 league table , behind sixth place @entity7 ( 118,352 improvements ) and fifth place @entity6 ( 129,301 ) which was part of the former @entity27 state of @entity28			1
a carriageway across the @entity30 in @entity6 , which was ranked higher than the @entity5 for road improvements @entity32 topped the list with 263,409 road improvements , followed by @entity35 ( 169,111 ) , @entity36 ( 145,641 ) and @entity37 ( 144,571 )			1
the damning data emerged after @entity14 recorded more than 1.5 million road changes across @entity4 in the past year - the first time that such detailed road change information has been mapped			1
it comes just days after @entity43 announced controversial plans to privatise the major road system , and in the wake of a highly critical ‘ alarm ’ report on the parlous state of the nation ’s increasingly potholed and crumbling highways			1
but the @entity14 report says : ‘ despite the huge growth in population and car ownership , it seems that investment in the @entity5 ’s road infrastructure is lagging behind other @entity4 countries			1
’ earlier this week prime minister @entity60 announced controversial @entity43 plans to privatise @entity62 ’s motorway and major trunk roads which could be run and maintained by private sector firms and investors , as well as allowing them to charge pay - as - you drive tolls on new roads or lanes which they create			2
the @entity5 was ranked just seventh in a list of @entity73 countries for its road improvement rating the aim is to improve the biggest and busiest roads on the @entity5 ’s ailing 362,598 mile road network			1
traffic congestion costs the @entity5 economy about £ 7bn a year according to @entity43 estimates			2
@entity14 managing director @entity81 said : ’ the road network is constantly changing			1
new roads are built and the layout of older roads adapted , with extra roundabouts , lanes and one - ways added in			2
we need to ensure that every single change is tracked so that drivers are up to date			0
‘ @entity14 has used its own unique methodology to measure and quantify all of these map changes and state the numbers are accurate			0
’ she added : ‘ given the huge number of road changes in the @entity5 every year , it is vital that drivers update the map on their satnav device when new maps become available			1
otherwise it ’s like driving round with last year ’s road atlas			1
’ @entity14 used detection systems to record map changes country by country throughout 2010 and 2011			0
in addition to satellite imagery and mobile mapping vans , geographic analysts used field surveys plus national and local source material to capture the changes			0
the map statistics also come hard on the heels of the government ’s ‘ satnav summit ’ designed to encourage local authorities and mapping companies to work more closely on communicating changes to the road network			1
@entity14 said its mapping teams work around the clock to track down every single change across the globe so that their sat - nav systems are completely up to date			0
it also consults with local governments and transportation authorities to build a real - time map			0
prime minister @entity60 announced plans earlier this week to privatise motorways and major trunk roads motorists are already enduring a ‘ pothole pandemic ’ as a £ 10billion backlog in crumbling road repairs is tackled by short - term and expensive patch - and - mend hole - filling , a major report revealed last week			1
the authoritative dossier backed by the @entity143 reveals that the number of potholes filled in across @entity62 and @entity146 has nearly doubled in five years to almost 1.7 million			0
but the millions spent is a ‘ ridiculous waste ’ of taxpayers ’ money as it fails to tackle the underlying problems and is simply ‘ plastering over the cracks , ’ said the @entity154 maintenance ( ‘ alarm ’ ) report by the @entity157 ( @entity157 )			0
it is also ‘ at least 20 times more expensive ’ to patch and mend ’ than to plan proper road maintenance , it says			2
the last three winter cold snaps alone have added an estimated £ 1.34billion to the nation ’s repair bill , it notes			0
critics said it was ‘ a disaster ’ and ‘ putting lives at risk			0
’ council chiefs admitted they were filling potholes ‘ at a rate of one every 18 seconds ’ but ‘ chasing their tails ’ on patching up roads rather than fixing them properly			0
even as things stand it will take @entity62 councils 11 years to clear the road maintenance backlog , while @entity146 councils will take 17 years , said the report			2
and some roads will go for nearly 100 years without being resurfaced at all , it reveals			0
councils in @entity62 and @entity146 have a total annual road maintenance funding shortfall of nearly £ 800million , with the average for each @entity62 council being £ 5.3million			2
road maintenance budgets fell by an average of 13 per cent last year to a total of £ 2.5 billion			2
as a result , one in five ( 20 per cent ) of local roads have only five years of live left in them - dropping to 1 in 4 ( 27 per cent ) in @entity192 .			0
