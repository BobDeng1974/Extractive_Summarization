by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 08:35 est , 8 april 2013 a graphic designer has combined a printer with a blowtorch to make an incredible tool which burns images onto surfaces down to the tiniest detail			1
the ' @entity8 ' was created by @entity9 to reproduce black and white images perfectly pixel for pixel on walls , wood , plastic and fabric			1
the blowtorch is mounted on rollers , and the user simply loads the image they want into a computer , the ' rolls ' the contraption along a large sheet of wood			1
@entity9 built the @entity8 which burns images pixel for pixel onto surfaces without setting them on fire the @entity8 combines an inkjet printer with a blowtorch to burn images onto surfaces butane and propane are burned at @entity35 to create black and white images pixel for pixel the tool , invented at @entity39 , the @entity40 , burns a mixture of butane and propane at @entity35 to create the images but does not set surfaces on fire			1
an @entity47 , a small self - contained computer , was programmed with wiring and processing to integrate an inkjet printer , a @entity53 torch , and a calibration module with an optical sensor			2
a user holds the @entity8 up against the surface they want to print on , and then guides it horizontally along using calibrated wheels			0
mr @entity9 said : ' @entity8 is a machine using contemporary rapid prototyping electronics combined with humanity â€™s first technology : fire , ' he said			2
the machine was constructed by @entity9 at @entity39 , the @entity40 wheels enable the user to lower the printer one line at a time on the vertical axis using a support @entity9 said he wanted to combine the oldest technology known to man with more modern tehnology ' the purpose is to propose a dialogue between image reproduction and its destruction			0
' the @entity8 works by feeding an image into the processing script , which writes a wiring code that can be compiled and sent onto the @entity83 board			0
it has wheels that enable the user to lower the printer one line at a time on the vertical axis on a support			0
the duration , strength and precision of the flame can be controlled in real - time manually with a pitch			0

@entity97 burns black and white images onto surfaces
contraption is rolled up a sheet of wood , *scorching* a pattern as it goes
butane and propane burn at @entity35 without setting surfaces on fire
