by @entity0 published : 15:44 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 15:51 est , 25 september 2013 government agents acting without authorization conducted dozens of undercover investigations of illegal tobacco sales , misused some of $ 162 million in profits from the stings and lost track of at least 420 million cigarettes , the @entity2 's inspector general said wednesday			1
in one case , agents for the @entity13 sold $ 15 million in cigarettes and later turned over $ 4.9 million in profits from the sales to a confidential informant — even though the agency did not properly account for the transaction			0
the @entity13 's newly - appointed director , @entity21 , said the audit covered only selected , ' historical ' @entity13 investigations between 2006 and 2011 , and said the agency had tightened its internal guidelines since then			2
misuse : the @entity13 says the agency misused some of $ 162 million in profits from stings including overpaying an informant by millions of dollars and lost track of at least 420 million cigarettes			1
questions to answer : @entity21 , director of the @entity13			0
the organization mounted dozens of undercover investigations into illicit cigarette sales without proper approval the audit described widespread lack of @entity13 oversight and inadequate paperwork in the agency 's ' churning investigations , ' undercover operations that use proceeds from illicit cigarette sales to pay for the @entity13 's costs			2
the audit came as a new blow to a beleaguered agency still reeling from congressional inquiries into the @entity13 's flawed handling of the @entity49 weapons tracking probes in @entity51			0
' @entity13 's guidance regarding churning investigations lacked breadth and specificity , and managers at @entity13 headquarters as well as managers and special agents at @entity13 field offices often disregarded it , ' inspector general @entity52 wrote in the 53 - page audit			1
the inspector general recommended tightened @entity13 procedures for documenting , tracking and reviewing proceeds from its undercover tobacco stings			1
change for the better : the @entity13 says it has instituted more stringent controls and restrictions ' on how money is used @entity21 said the agency has adopted most of those guidelines			1
while accepting responsibility for ' management and oversight lapses that allowed those deficiencies to develop , ' he insisted that ' the report 's findings do not reflect current @entity13 policy or practice in this area			2
' in a written response , @entity52 approved the @entity13 's moves in april 2013 to tighten its standards			0
@entity52 cautioned that his office ' has not been provided evidence to verify the sufficiency of actions taken			0
' reviewing three - dozen @entity13 undercover cigarette stings between 2006 and 2011 , the inspector general found that none of those income - generating probes had been given proper prior approval by an internal @entity13 review committee , as required by agency policy			1
in the past : the @entity13 's new director , @entity21 , said the audit covered only selected @entity13 investigations between 2006 and 2011 , and that the agency had tightened its internal guidelines since then one of those sting operations did not have any approval , either from the @entity13 or the @entity2			0
in that 2009 case , @entity13 officials allowed a tobacco distributor working as an @entity13 confidential informant to keep $ 4.9 million in profits from cigarette sales to criminal suspects			0
@entity13 officials justified the move by explaining the $ 4.9 million covered the informant 's expenses			0
but the inspector general said the agency failed to ' require the informant to provide adequate documentation to support or justify those expenses			2
' the remaining profits were used by agency officials to pay for a separate @entity13 cigarette smuggling sting — which the inspector general said violated @entity13 rules that profits from a ' churning investigation ' could only be used to fund that specific operation , not other cases			1
the inspector general said shoddy documentation and inventory controls made it impossible to account for more than 2.1 million cartons of cigarettes — totaling 420 million cigarettes — during at least 20 separate @entity13 sting operations			1
the watchdog estimated the retail value of those items at $ 127 million .			0

inspector general *faulted* @entity13 for ' a serious lack ' of management
millions of dollars used in *35* investigations could not be accounted for
@entity13 says it has instituted more ' stringent controls and restrictions ' on how the money is used
