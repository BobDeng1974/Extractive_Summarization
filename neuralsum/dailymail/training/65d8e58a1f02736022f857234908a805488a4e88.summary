by @entity0 published : 10:36 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 05:26 est , 12 march 2013 survivor : after becoming free of a violent relationship , @entity1 has trained to be a counsellor so she can help others when @entity1 attended art college when she was 18 with a black eye , her alarmed friends asked her what had happened			1
' i was mugged , ' she told them - one of the many lies she told during a terrifying two - and - a - half - year period when she was in fact being attacked by her boyfriend			2
@entity1 had met her abusive ex , @entity14 , when she started at university in @entity16 and had no idea how violent he would become			1
she told @entity18 : ' he was charming and fun and completely swept me off my feet			1
he could be intense at times but i had no idea how aggressive he could be			1
he was my first serious boyfriend and i had low self - esteem at the time , i was flattered by his attention			2
' @entity1 said their relationship moved quickly and after meeting in september 1998 , she moved in with him just before @entity26			1
while she had seen @entity14 drinking on nights out , she had n't been aware just how much he was also consuming at home			1
' sometimes he would down a bottle of wine a night and more than that at weekends , ' she said			2
it was while he was under the influence of alcohol that he would often become violent			2
@entity1 revealed the first time he attacked her was after they had been to his brother 's birthday party			1
he had been wound up by something as simply as her choice of outfit			0
' before we left @entity14 had complained about the cardigan i was wearing saying it was ' ugly ' and he was embarrassed to be seen with me in it , ' she recalls			1
' i did n't understand why it upset him so much			0
after his brother 's party ended he also became fixated on the idea that i had flirted with one of his brother 's friends			1
' when we got home things got much worse			0
he shouted and screamed at me and was so abusive , the night ended with him punching me in the ear and throwing a mirror at me			0
' the next day my ear was ringing and @entity14 was in tears , saying he was sorry and it would never happen again			1
' this began to become a pattern in their relationship with @entity14 getting abusive over the slightest thing @entity1 did and then begging her for forgiveness the next day			1
@entity1 said : ' he hated it if i wore clothes he did n't like or if he thought i was dressing provocatively			1
he 'd also get mad if i did well at university and would destroy some of my artwork so i 'd have to do it again			0
' ' he pushed me to the floor and pounded my head against it over and over			0
when i came free of him i locked myself in the bathroom the rest of the night , i was terrified ' she added : ' he did n't like me having friends - male or female			0
it got to the point where i could n't even mention another man 's name			0
' once i made the mistake of mentioning an ex when we were in the midst of boiling the kettle and he threw the water over me			0
another time , he chased me with a meat cleaver when i talked about a man in my class at college			0
' then he became fixated with my female friends , he became convinced they were lesbians who wanted to sleep with me			0
' it was ' crazy ' @entity1 admits now but she succumbed to his wishes and isolated herself more from her friends			1
terrifying : @entity1 said her boyfriend abused her for more than two years , she once ended up in hospital ( posed by models ) she also did n't turn to her family as her sister was struggling with bipolar disorder , and she did n't want to worry her parents further			1
@entity1 said @entity14 often went for her head and neck when he attacked her			1
she passed off her black eyes and bruises when people quizzed her at university as clumsiness , falling off her bike or even being mugged			0
after one particularly violent episode where he repeatedly bashed her head against the floor , @entity1 ended up in hospital			1
she said @entity14 showered her with gifts on her release and promised he would never hurt her again			1
her vulnerability and feelings for him meant she forgave him again			0
' it took me some time in counselling to understand that what had happened was not my fault ' ' i was confused and frightened , ' @entity1 said			1
' he would always be so sorry and so charming afterwards			1
he said he needed me and could n't live without me			0
' as i had few friends and i did n't feel like i could turn to my family , i felt like he was all i had			2
i had lost all my confidence and did n't feel sure of myself			0
' @entity1 eventually told her father what was happening after a horrific night with @entity14 in which she feared he would kill her			1
she said : ' it was new years eve 2001 and the first time @entity14 became abusive in public when he was drunk			1
he was abusive to a friend of mine in a taxi , then when we were chucked out of the cab , he shouted at me the whole way home			0
when we got to the house , he threw me up against a wall and held my neck trying to strangle me			0
' then he pushed me to the floor and pounded my head against it over and over			0
when i came free of him i locked myself in the bathroom the rest of the night , i was terrified			0
' in the morning i told him what he had done and told him to leave , he then picked up a knife and threatened to kill himself			2
i ran upstairs and locked myself in the bathroom again , not knowing what to do			0
i thought he would kill me			2
i rang my father who came and threw @entity14 and all his belongings out			1
' @entity1 , now 34 , said it took time to get over the relationship and she lived in fear of @entity14 pursuing her for a time			1
he did turn up once to one of her art exhibitions and tried to friend her on @entity166 but @entity1 ignored him on both occasions			1
she said : ' it took me some time in counselling to understand that what had happened was not my fault			0
i learnt about the wheel of power and control and how perpetrators use emotional as well as sometimes physical abuse to keep their victim scared			2
' it took me a long time to admit to others that i was a survivor of domestic violence as i was so full of shame that it had happened to me			0
the truth is it can happen to anyone			0
' control : @entity1 said her ex made her feel confused and frightened , she doubted her own mind and had no confidence ( posed by models ) @entity1 , now 34 , has since rebuilt her life in @entity192			1
she has trained to be a counsellor and found love again with a man who she said makes her ' very happy			2
' they have been together seven years and live with their pet cats			2
through the website www.hope2heal.co.uk , she now helps other people deal with their problems - whether that 's surviving domestic abuse , beating addiction or coping with bereavement			2
for anyone who is trapped in a cycle of abuse like she once was , she recommends they seek support as soon as possible			2
' you might think it , but you are never alone , ' she said			0
' if you do n't have friends or family you can turn to there are local services like refuges available			2
they can help you leave an abusive partner and help you explore your legal position			0
' you can take out a restraining order or even prosecute			0
i wish at the time i had more knowledge about the legal system and domestic violence , as now it is too late to prosecute @entity14			1
' i can also understand why women suffering domestic violence may be afraid to leave but there are people out there who can support and empower you			0

@entity1 started a relationship with ' charming ' @entity14 when she was 18 and had no idea of the *monster* he would become
he would drink excessively and violently attack her
abuse would be prompted by smallest thing such as what clothes she wore
he would always beg for forgiveness and she had nobody to turn to
after more than two years , she eventually escaped after calling her father when she feared @entity14 would kill her
now she works as a counsellor to help others
