@entity1 are frightened to reveal their religious beliefs to colleagues at work , equality chiefs admit			1
when they do declare their @entity5 , whether in the office or on the shop floor , they are often mocked or treated like bigots – and their children are even ridiculed at school			2
@entity1 also think their faith is being pushed out of its role as a cornerstone of life in @entity15 , according to a major study by the @entity17			1
and ironically , many feel they are being persecuted by the same anti-discrimination and equality laws supported by the equality watchdog			1
persecuted : the study of 2,500 people found many of the @entity1 who took part felt they needed to hide their faith at work or at school , for fear of being called bigots or being mocked nearly 2,500 people of all faiths were quizzed about religion at work for the nationwide study			1
it follows years of conflict over @entity1 ’ right to act in accordance with their religious beliefs			1
a series of high - profile court battles have left many feeling that the law is tilted against them and that gay rights trump their own			2
many of the major test cases have been backed by the equality commission itself , including the successful @entity52 case brought by a gay couple against hoteliers @entity54 and @entity56 , who declined to rent them a room because they were not married			2
the commission is currently backing a legal claim against a @entity61 - based @entity5 - run bakery that would n’t bake a cake bearing a slogan that supported gay marriage			2
of those who responded to the commission ’s survey , 1,030 said they were @entity5			0
the next largest group – 188 – were atheist			0
people of other faiths made up the rest			0
the commission ’s report said : ‘ a recurring theme among some employees was the pressure they felt they were under to keep their religion hidden at work and feeling discriminated against when it came to wearing religious symbols or expressing their beliefs			1
this was particularly felt by @entity1			1
‘ people reported being mocked for their beliefs , including @entity1 , who said their colleagues assumed they were bigoted			1
some christian - run services or businesses said they felt in turmoil about behaving in ways that they feared might breach the @entity91 , which protects people from discrimination in the workplace and in access to goods and services			0
’ there were also protests from some humanists and atheists , the report said , including complaints there were no humanist chaplains at hospitals			0
several atheists felt left out if they worked for companies that staged events in churches			0
@entity17 chief executive @entity111 said of the survey : ‘ what came out strongly was the widespread confusion about the law , leading to some resentment and tensions between groups , and anxiety for employers who fear falling foul of what they see as complicated equality and human rights legislation			1
’ he said that the commission would produce new guidance to ‘ help everyone address some of the issues ’			0
@entity131 of the @entity132 – a think tank that has supported opponents of the commission in court – said : ‘ it is a relief that the commission is beginning to realise there is a problem			0
’ but he added : ‘ it would help if it admitted that it may have been part of the problem			0
in many cases the commission has aggressively promoted cases against innocent @entity1 like @entity54 and @entity56			2
‘ there was an appalling case a few years ago when a commission lawyer referred to the spread of @entity5 views using the word “ infected ”			0
it is going to have to do an awful lot of work to rebuild confidence among @entity1 and persuade them that it does not regard secularism as the solution to all problems			1

study claims @entity1 feel under pressure to hide faith at work
@entity1 also feel religion is being pushed out of ' cornerstone ' role in @entity15
many feel they persecuted by anti-discrimination and equality laws
but equality chief says there is widespread confusion about the law
