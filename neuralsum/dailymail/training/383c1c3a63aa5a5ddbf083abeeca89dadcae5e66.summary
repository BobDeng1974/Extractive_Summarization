by @entity0 last updated at 5:32 am on 12th january 2012 the ticket to @entity2 may say nonstop , but the flight may not be , thanks in part to a supercharged jetstream across the @entity7			1
carriers like @entity11 have been making unscheduled pit stops as they fly west - in fact , every 43 out of 1,100 flights were diverted in december in @entity15 aircrafts , reports say			1
a year ago , that number was only 12			2
but weather patterns are n’t the only culprit - the airline has been using the smaller jet to fly to and from @entity2 in an attempt to cut costs			1
fighting the headwinds : @entity11 has made unannounced landings in four per cent of its december flights in order to refuel @entity27 – which operates both @entity28 and @entity11 after their 2010 merger – said the headwinds this december have been incredibly strong , in part due to @entity32			1
the winds typically averaged 28 mph ten years ago , but are now nearly double that , the strongest it ’s been in ten years			1
but the unscheduled landings are tied up in the company ’s enthusiastic use of the smaller , single - aisle 757 rather than larger models , which take up more fuel but also have bigger tanks and range			1
smaller planes also mean fewer flight attendants			0
but the result is toying with the plane ’s limits , the @entity46 reports			0
@entity50 have a nautical range of around 4,000 miles , which pushes the boundary on most transcontinental flights , especially when strong headwinds eat up more of the plane ’s fuel reserves			1
pilots have made landings in @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , and elsewhere to refuel their aircraft , a safer bet than eating into fuel reserves			1
by law , pilots must have enough fuel to fly the plane for an additional 45 minutes past its planned destination			1
waiting game : refueling the 757s means longer wait times and possibly missing connecting flights the remote @entity77 and @entity78 airports in @entity59 remain the most popular refuelling locations			2
while refilling the aircraft typically takes 45 minutes to an hour to complete , it can cost those on tight travelling schedules days after missed connections			0
a typical nonstop flight from @entity86 to @entity87 , @entity88 now takes around eight and a half hours , as opposed to seven hours in the opposite direction			0
while there ’s little to be done about unpredictable weather patterns , travellers can use several tricks to better their chances a flight wo n’t make an unannounced pit stop			0
the best way is by checking the plane model			0
airlines often show seat maps during ticket purchasing			0
this often reveals if the aircraft used will be a 757 ( with one aisle ) or a larger carrier with two aisles			2
the @entity107 said wednesday in a statement that it is ‘ aware that @entity28 aircraft have made more unscheduled fuel stops this year than last year and we are looking into the issue			1
’ while the choice makes more business sense to an industry that has witnessed very real and severe financial changes and skyrocketing fuel prices , it has been nothing but a headache to the thousands of travellers forced to make other plans as their nonstop flights have been delayed by hours at a time			1
a spokesman for the company said that when the situation warrants it , passengers are compensated for the inconvenience			0
using smaller aircraft works when the weather is docile , but this particular weather pattern is unpredictable , making the use of 757s for nonstop flights a gamble			2
meteorologists are unsure how long this one will last			2
@entity28 / @entity11 spokesperson @entity138 said that the headwinds have been a ‘ once in ten year extreme			1
’ the scenic route : some @entity11 flights returning from @entity2 stop at @entity59 's remote @entity78 to refuel she told @entity149 : ‘ we are looking at it very closely , it is an inconvenience to our customers , to determine if there are other options			1
’ the strong winds work in favour of travellers heading east , however			0
according to @entity155 , @entity154 - bound flights are saving money because of the added boost of the winds			1
because of the unseasonably mild winter , airlines have been saving money that would have been otherwise spent ploughing , salting , and de-frosting			0
in addition , smaller airports can bring in ‘ tens of thousands of dollars ’ in landing fees and other profits			0
other airlines have also been affected by the headwinds			2
@entity168 and @entity169 both fly 757s to @entity2 but have had only a few diversions due to the strong winds			0
@entity172 , according to the @entity46 , had none			0
a flight to @entity175 , @entity176 from @entity87 , @entity88 is around 4,540 miles , though according to @entity15 ’s website , the 757 has a maximum range of around 4,450 nautical miles			2
skyrocketing costs : rising fuel prices have left the airline with few options - without headwinds , the flight can be done easily with a 757 a spokeswoman said that several modifications to the model have allowed for better fuel efficiency			1
on a very short list of options , @entity11 has discussed the use of extra tanks on its 757 models , sources told the @entity46			1
in 2005 , the airline company swapped out many of its older features that were prime culprits in guzzling fuel			2
@entity32 brings cooler than normal ocean temperatures across the @entity200 and wetter than normal conditions in the northwest			1
its outcomes most often manifest during the winter months			0
according to @entity205 , trade winds are unusually strong during the weather pattern due to a contrast in pressure			0
winglets were added to allow 200 additional miles of flying			0
steel brakes were replaced with carbon ones , that cut the weight of the aircraft by 600 pounds			0
in addition , several coach - class seats were removed , bringing the total number to 169 , allowing for slightly less luggage and more legroom , a spokesperson said			2
@entity11 executive @entity222 told the @entity46 that installing more fuel tanks is ‘ not economical ’ and ‘ fairly complicated			1
’ @entity169 still uses 777 and 767 jets , which travel longer distances without the need to refuel			0
other larger models are used on different routes .			0

@entity11 often uses 757 jet for *international* flights
jetstream from @entity32 force unscheduled fuel landings on @entity154 - bound flights
