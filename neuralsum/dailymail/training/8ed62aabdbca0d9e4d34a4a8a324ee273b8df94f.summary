it was supposed to be her acting comeback , a triumphant debut on stage in @entity6 's @entity5 in the production of @entity8			1
but sadly for @entity10 , things did n't exactly go to plan on her opening night on wednesday			2
while not an unmitigated disaster , the 28 - year - old actress did n't appear to know her lines off by heart , reading some from a book while being fed others from the side of stage			1
and to makes matters worse , her one main passionate speech only succeeded in causing the audience to burst into laughter , according to onlookers			1
a job well done ! @entity10 lapped up the roaring applause from the audience at the conclusion of the play despite some unintentional laughter throughout the three - act play , written by @entity30 , tells the story of two @entity33 hot shots , @entity34 and @entity35 ( @entity36 and @entity37 ) , who both attempt to bed their new secretary , @entity40 ( @entity10 )			1
while those in the audience agreed @entity10 looked beautiful , reaction was decidedly mixed on her performance			2
@entity44 from @entity45 said : ' @entity10 only has one major speech in the @entity30 play that marks her @entity5 debut			1
unfortunately , she could n’t remember how it went			0
' on the first night of previews , a work - in - progress feel is to be expected			1
but halfway through the second act of @entity8 , the audience was openly laughing at @entity10 ’s struggle to grasp @entity30 ’s sharp , trademark dialogue			1
' @entity56 ! at the end of the evening the @entity58 star was gifted with a large bouquet of flowers for all her hard work life imitating art.			2
. the script lifts the lid on the underbelly of @entity33 and was penned by @entity68 - winning screenwriter @entity30 chic : @entity10 looked stylish in a black suit and white shirt combo while her red locks were worn out he said the audience sat patiently through the first prompt , but noted that her second ' led to titters ' in the stalls			2
he added : ' unfortunately for @entity10 , the next line delivered by @entity36 ( @entity79 from @entity80 ) was : " you have done a fantastic job ! "			2
' at one point , mr @entity44 said a woman in the crowd moaned ' @entity88 , it 's so embarrassing ' during a set change			0
she also caused unintentional hilarity with one particular section of her speech when the @entity33 bad girl , who has spent time in jail and rehab , said ( in character as @entity40 ) , ' i know what it is to be bad , i ’ve been bad			1
' entertaining plot : @entity10 's character @entity40 is a secretary to a @entity33 executive who tries to manipulate her way to success for me ? @entity10 looked taken aback when an assistant ran up to hand her the beautiful blooms jitters : according to some audience members on @entity111 , the star forgot a few of her lines onlookers revealed this caused the entire theatre to burst into laughter , something which @entity10 would not have been too pleased with			1
others were willing to cut @entity10 a bit of slack on her first night			0
one source told @entity123 : ' she was just fine , she did forget her lines a couple of times , but covered it up like a pro. she was a pleasant surprise for sure			0
' @entity10 's character was quite interesting and she immersed herself in the role , she was very strong in the second scene which was her biggest one			0
' centre stage : but the jury is out on @entity10 's @entity5 debut a new chapter : ' i ’m hoping it ’ll take away attention from me as a celebrity name and draw attention to the fact that i ’m an actress , ' @entity10 told @entity142 knuckling down : ' i ’m at a point when i want a diligent routine and i really want to get back into work ' the source added : ' she looked amazing ... i was in awe of her			1
it was no means a perfect performance and she 's certainly no @entity149 , but she was n't awful			0
' there is a line where she says " i know what it is to be bad , i 've been bad " and the audience all cracked up laughing but she got great applause in the curtain call and someone passed her flowers from audience			1
' and @entity111 reaction was decidedly mixed : ' user @ toflee wrote : ' so @entity10 had her lines written down in a book & also got fed a line			2
' rehearsals : the actress has relocated to @entity6 for the role			0
' being here in @entity6 is all about me this time , ' she told @entity123 big shoes to fill : in 1988 @entity172 's character @entity40 was also portrayed by chart - topper @entity173 good luck ! the actress took to the stage in a white dress while sipping red wine and ‏ @ rafayfay added : ' major kudos to the woman who was feeding @entity10 her lines from offstage at # speedtheplow			1
' ‏ @ mizukawaseiwa tweeted : ' oh my , and @entity36 ! - @ thedailybeast : @entity6 laughs at @entity10 's @entity5 debut : @entity188			1
' however , there were some positive reviews with @entity193 writing , ' loved love loved # speedtheplow ! ! @ lindsaylohan was superb in the 3rd act ! such an amazing actress ! ! he added : ' she was a bit nervous at the beginning but then totally nailed it ! ' @ officialkims took to @entity111 to write ' and congratulations @ lindsaylohan opening night of # speedtheplow all the fear is really only one fear			2
' @entity207 turn : @entity10 appears in the @entity30 rerun alongside @entity36 ( pictured ) and @entity37 experienced : @entity36 is perhaps best known for his role as @entity79 in political drama @entity80 @entity212 : the two co-stars act out a pivotal scene in @entity30 's hit play line by line : the actress struggled in her new role at times during a night of mixed reviews for her @entity5 debut and fan account @ @entity223 tweeted : ' i 'm going to cry ! ! ! ! @entity226 : ) you deserve an everyday standing ovation @ lindsaylohan xoxoxo repost from			1
