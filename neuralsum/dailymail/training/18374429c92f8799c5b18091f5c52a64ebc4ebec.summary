@entity0 remain an enigma to me			1
on sunday they face their main rivals for the title in @entity6 and they have been transformed as a club since @entity8 took them over in 2008			1
that said , the owners have invested £ 865million in the club in the six years in which they have owned it yet i still ca n’t quite grasp their true identity			0
on their day , they can be something special			1
look at their results against @entity18 in the past three seasons			0
in six @entity22 games they have scored 18 goals against them and won five of those games			0
and in the majority of those encounters they have been absolutely brilliant			0
@entity30 picks up @entity31 after @entity33 champions @entity32 's late winner on wednesday evening , as @entity0 left - back @entity35 fails to stop @entity36 passing him at the byline @entity0 can dazzle , but they have also showed their weaknesses this season , losing to @entity40 at home the pace of their game , the way they have moved the ball , the speed of their attacks and their strength at the back have been too much for @entity18			1
they are on a completely different level and those performances have been close to 10/10 displays			2
on days like that you ’re left wondering whether they can challenge @entity59 and @entity60			0
but i do n’t see them hitting those heights nearly enough			2
if you catch @entity0 on an off day you can definitely takes points off them , as @entity40 did the other week			1
and there are far too many of those days for a club of their aspirations			0
when i think about the great @entity22 teams such as @entity18 and @entity78 in the 1990s and 2000s , players like @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 would put in performances that were 8/10 every single week			2
and if you happened to catch them on a good day , they would be 9/10 or close to 10/10			2
at @entity0 , i think you could say that @entity81 and @entity30 meet that standard but not enough of their other key players			1
too many can have sleepy days when they ’re well below their best			0
maybe it ’s because of the changes in managers over the last six years but their identity in terms of the playing style is an issue for me			0
they ’re not a team that will retreat into a solid shape and defend deep			0
but i do n’t see them as a free - flowing team , as @entity18 were in their heyday ; they do n’t play with the freedom of wide wingers			2
i do n’t know if they want to be an open team who will go out and play with flair and to win simply because we ’ve got better players than you			0
they ’re not a team that will defend deep and make it difficult for teams and then hit them on the break			2
they want to control games but i ’m not sure they have midfielders who are consistent enough to do that			0
it ’s very early days but @entity0 ’s start to the season has been unsure and stuttering , putting them under extra pressure on sunday because they do n’t want to see the five - point gap behind @entity6 increase			1
they need to ensure that they do n’t fall into the trap of one season on and one season off , as they did after finally winning the title in 2012			1
they seemed to drop off in their intensity the following season and just at the moment you might be seeing the start of something similar			2
with the money that has been invested , i would imagine that the owners would want to see back - to - back @entity22 titles or a @entity146 semi-final or final this season but , right now , i would put @entity148 ’s team ahead of them			1
the likes of @entity72 and @entity73 would put in 8/10 performances every week in six @entity22 games against @entity18 , @entity0 have scored 18 goals against them and won five it ’s partly why sunday 's contest is so fascinating			1
@entity0 were outwitted in the equivalent fixture last season on another of those all - too - familiar off days , even if they got their revenge shortly after in the @entity160			1
but @entity0 are @entity22 champions			2
they need to start dominating like champions and asserting themselves			0
and if they summon one of their better performances , then they can start that process on sunday			2
@entity0 have too many ' sleepy ' players , and @entity6 are currently looking stronger @entity0 suffered their third defeat of the season at @entity32 in the @entity146 @entity6 have won every game this season in the @entity22 , having played four @entity171 is the missing link for @entity6 @entity171 is the real deal as a striker			1
his attributes look tailor - made for @entity177 football			1
he has a bit of everything about him			0
he is great at holding the ball up , has enough speed to get in behind defenders , can work the 18 - yard box and is clearly not going to be intimidated by physical opponents			2
@entity171 scored a hat - trick against @entity187 last weekend and is already on seven goals in a blue shirt i would put his former @entity192 team - mate , @entity191 , just ahead of him overall but he still looks like the missing link for @entity6			1
they — as @entity192 before them — have worked out how to play in the way that suits him best , which @entity199 , with their short intricate passing , did n’t manage in the @entity200			0
together with @entity201 , he has formed a wonderful understanding and @entity6 look a better side than last season — and that ’s after having made a profit of transfers in the summer			1
@entity201 looks to be the perfect replacement for @entity209			0
he might not score as many but he will create more			0
i would imagine he ’ll play just behind @entity210 at @entity0 on sunday , with @entity211 and @entity212 sitting in the deeper positions to add a bit more solidity			1
@entity201 has slotted seamlessly back into @entity177 football following his arrival back from @entity60 you might have thought it would take @entity6 three or four months for their new signings to settle in but @entity171 , @entity201 and @entity221 have adapted straight away , which is why i have them as title favourites			1
they do n’t need to win on sunday ; a draw would do them fine			0
@entity148 always said that this was the season on which we should judge him and , so far , that ’s looking like a good call			1
@entity228 deserves time to recover the player who has received the most criticism for his midfield performances and his inconsistency this week has been @entity31			1
the 31 - year - old has been instrumental in the reshaping of @entity0 and been a powerhouse in midfield in their title - winning seasons			1
@entity31 was n't at his best on wednesday night as @entity0 lost 1 - 0 to @entity32 video we must support @entity31 - @entity240 but behind every dip in form , there is always a back story			1
we do n’t know exactly what the reason is with @entity228 but we do know his brother , @entity247 , died in the summer			0
sometimes we simply analyse players as though they are footballing machines but the raw emotion of such a tragedy ca n’t fail to have an impact in some way			0
it is something i ’ve been through recently			0
@entity228 was not at his best against @entity32 and he does look a little detached since the @entity200			0
i would guess he needs some time and space to get back to his best			0
given what he has contributed to @entity0 , he ’s earned that right .			2

@entity0 face their main rivals for the title in @entity6 on sunday
@entity0 often dazzle with their performances and can be truly special
but they do n't hit the heights nearly enough , and on an off - day they can be easily beaten , as @entity40 proved last month by winning at the @entity267
they must not fall into the trap of ' one season on and one season off '
currently , @entity148 's @entity6 look a better outfit
@entity171 is the real deal and is tailor - made for @entity177 football
@entity31 deserves time to *refresh* himself and regain form
