actor @entity0 , who said he was ‘ still processing ’ his response to scenes such as gun battles in his new film @entity4 : the @entity6 he made his name playing calm , civilised gentlemen in films such as @entity10			1
so movie - goers may be shocked at the graphic violence in @entity0 ’s latest film			1
the actor , told @entity16 magazine he was ‘ still processing ’ his response to scenes such as gun battles in @entity4 : the @entity6			1
he called for ‘ legitimate discussions ’ on whether film - makers should be encouraging audiences to enjoy violence			1
campaigners called his remarks ‘ very encouraging ’ but urged him to refuse roles in such films in future			0
in @entity4 , rated 15 and due for release on january 29 , @entity0 plays a spy training a homeless youngster to be a secret agent			1
@entity31 also stars sir @entity32 and @entity33 and is released on january 29 with a 15 rating			0
it is the latest film from @entity36 , the husband on supermodel @entity37 and the director behind the films @entity40 and @entity41 , which both drew attention because of their controversial content			1
this latest project sees super-spy @entity45 , played by @entity0 , take a rough street kid under his wing and train him to be a lethal secret agent			1
but father - of - three @entity0 said : ‘ i ’m still processing my response			1
i did think , “ i do n’t know what i ’m getting into now			0
” and there will be arguments , legitimate discussions , about whether it ’s healthy to enjoy anything with violence			2
' particularly when you ’re dared to enjoy it			2
i still do n’t have the answers on what ’s supposed to be good and bad			0
but i was exhilarated as well			0
’ his comments have been welcomed by campaigners against on - screen violence , who have called on filmmakers to take note of @entity0 ’s concerns			1
@entity69 , co-founder of the @entity71 campaign , said : ‘ i think it ’s very encouraging that an actor of his standing does question this level of violence			2
i rather hope that at some point someone will say “ i ’m not going to act in this film because of the levels of violence and i should n’t be promoting this sort of violence ” , but i ’m very encouraged to hear what he ’s said			2
‘ it ’s made him worried and concerned obviously and he ’s quite right to be concerned that viewers are almost expected to enjoy this sort of violence , otherwise why would they have it in the first place ? teaching role : @entity0 plays secret agent @entity45 who recruits street kid @entity92 , played by @entity93 , for a spy organisation 's ultra-competitive training program ‘ i think the people who ought to be listening to him are people like the government , like the @entity102 that classifies films , the people who produce the films , they are who i would consider as the target audience [ for his comments ]			1
i do n’t know if the lad on the street will care what @entity0 says			2
’ however , she is also not convinced that the film ’s 15 rating will protect children from being exposed to @entity31 ’s violent scenes and dismissed the claim that its tongue - in - cheek tone will lessen its impact			1
she added : ‘ there is so much violence in the media and it glorifies it for young people , the other thing of course is that it ’s not going to be just 15 year olds and up who are going to see the film , once it ’s in circulation young kids always see them , it ’s just not healthy			2
’ ‘ the bottom line is violence is violence			0
i know a lot of people say if it ’s funny it ’s not as important but quite frankly , any high level of violence , whatever justification they might try and put forward to it , i do n’t think there is any real justification for it			0
’ @entity0 made his name playing calm , civilised gentlemen in films such as @entity10 and @entity146 , pictured this is not the first time an actor has publicly voiced concern over the level of violence in a film they have starred in			1
in 2013 , @entity154 criticised @entity41 2 , which was produced by @entity31 ’s director @entity36			0
@entity154 , who played a masked vigilante in the comedy superhero film , said he could no longer support the project following the @entity159 which claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults			0
he posted on @entity163 : ‘ i did kickass a month b4 @entity159 and now in all good conscience i can not support that level of violence			0
’ and added : ‘ my apologies to others involve with the film			0
i am not ashamed of it but recent events have caused a change in my heart			0
’ @entity175 , who are distributing the film , did not respond to requests for comment .			0
