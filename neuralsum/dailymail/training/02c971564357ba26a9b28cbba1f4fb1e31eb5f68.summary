from the moment the father of @entity2 took the stage with president @entity5 , it was clear the @entity6 were not an average @entity8 military family			2
sporting a long , bushy beard that he refused to trim since his son went missing in 2009 , @entity9 spoke @entity12 , @entity14 's main language , and also a few words of @entity16 at the @entity18 press conference announcing his son 's release			1
some critics of the deal to free the only remaining @entity8 prisoner of war have shifted their attention to mr @entity2 and his controversial statements			2
just a few days before his son was released in a trade for five @entity29 detainees , mr @entity26 tweeted at a @entity31 spokesman saying , ' i am still working to free all @entity29 prisoners			1
' ' @entity34 will repay for the death of every @entity14 child , ameen			1
he is also pictured right in a cowboy hat at a family reunion some years ago the tweet was later deleted , but not before it was spotted by several conservative activists			1
some are raising questions about mr @entity26 's loyalties - possibly even converting to @entity58			2
he has become an active anti-war campaigner and spoken out against drone strikes and @entity29			2
' folks , this is either a very bad case of @entity46 or something far more nefarious is at stake , ' wrote former @entity65 congressman @entity65 , who labeled the message a ' smoking gun			1
' ' regardless , there is more to this than meets the eye of @entity5 making a unilateral decision and announcement on a saturday - when he believes no one is watching			2
' supporters see a man who has done everything he could raise awareness of his son 's five years in enemy captivity and project any image that might be likely to keep @entity2 alive			1
in a video posted by the @entity82 , mr @entity2 told photographer @entity83 : ' i do n't work for the military			0
i do n't work for the government			0
i do n't represent the @entity8 people			0
i 'm a father who wants his son back			1
' mr @entity2 's former pastor @entity90 told the @entity91 that the father began to study radical @entity58 politics as a way to understand his son 's captors			2
he grew a beard to mark the time his son was gone - but also , possibly - to win some sympathy from the @entity31 who held @entity2			1
before @entity2 was captures , mr @entity2 was best known as the town 's @entity102 deliveryman			0
it all changed when @entity2 was taken by the @entity31			0
friends say he delved deeply into his studies of the country and the people who were holding his son			2
some wondered aloud whether he had crossed a line , the @entity91 reports			0
@entity2 is seen here in april 2010 in @entity31 captivity			0
this image was released by the soldier 's captors during his five - year ordeal @entity38 also got criticism for this tweet , in which he called democracy a ' cult ' a spokesman for the family told the @entity91 that that @entity6 acknowledged that the tweet about the deaths of @entity14 children being avenged was sent and then deleted , but did not offer a further explanation			1
some activists have picked up on other tweets from mr @entity2 , as well			0
in march , he wrote , ' " democracy " is a cult in the @entity131 ' in response to a comment about the @entity14 elections			1
he also raised eyebrows when , in a pres conference , he said the family 's hometown of @entity140 , @entity141 , ' we 're so much like @entity14			1
' in a 2011 video message to @entity2 's captors , mr @entity2 said : ' strangely to some we must also thank those who have cared for our son for almost two years			1
' we know our son is a prisoner and at the same time a guest in your home			2
' idyllic ? this is the beautiful homestead of @entity9 and @entity151 in @entity140 , @entity141			1
the @entity6 hope @entity2 will return here to a hero 's welcome			0
but what were the circumstances of his release ? the @entity141 - native @entity6 were unlike many military families - or unlike many other families - well before @entity2 was captures			0
the @entity161 reports that @entity9 and @entity162 are still seen at church in town			1

they also reportedly traveled 300 miles to attend an @entity167 in @entity168 for a time			0
@entity2 took ballet , but could also ride a horse and shoot a rifle by age 5			0
mr @entity83 , the @entity82 journalist who followed @entity2 in @entity14 before his capture and late spent time with his father , said mr @entity2 became political out of necessity after his son fell into @entity31 hands			1
' i do n’t think he had all the opinions at the beginning that he had at the end			0
i think his thinking has changed , ' he said			0
' he was trying to understand			0
it ’s not a question of agreeing with people			0
it ’s a question , from his point of view , of trying to understand where they may be coming from			0
' in a @entity192 article last year , mr @entity2 said he kept in contact with a @entity31 source who claimed to know where his son was			2
he also said he had learned a great deal about @entity14 politics			1
he learned to speak a few words of @entity12 and @entity16 so he could record a 2011 video message to his son 's captors .			1

@entity9 has drawn *scrutiny* after speaking @entity12 , an @entity14 language , and @entity16 at a @entity40 press conference
he has refused to trim his beard since his son was captured in 2009
