by @entity1 reporter distress : @entity3 was left ' disturbed ' after learning her home was the site of a murder - suicide a woman has appealed to the state @entity8 after a home seller and real estate agent allegedly failed to tell her a murder - suicide had taken place in the home they sold her			1
when @entity3 , 59 , moved from @entity17 to @entity18 , @entity19 in 2007 , she was unaware that the new house she had bought for $ 610,000 had been the site of two deaths a year earlier			1
only when she moved in and began chatting to the neighbours did she learn of her new home 's grisly past - and the discovery left her disturbed , according to the lawsuit			1
she sued the sellers , @entity28 and @entity29 , and the real estate agent , @entity31 , for fraud and misrepresentation , claiming they deliberately hid what had occurred at the home			0
but the trial judge ruled in favour of the defendants , saying state law does not require agents to disclose such facts , @entity36 reported			1
last month , the state appeals court agreed with the decision			2
according to the opinion penned by president judge @entity47 , sellers are only required to identify structural , hazardous and legal impairments to a property			2
the opinion noted the @entity51 and their realtors sought advice from the @entity19 @entity54 and were told they did not need to disclose the murder - suicide			2
' if psychological defects must be disclosed , then we are not far from requiring sellers to reveal that a next - door neighbor is loud and obnoxious , or on some days you can smell a nearby sewage plant , or that the house was built on an old @entity64 burial ground , ' the opinion said			2
scene : the @entity18 , @entity19 home where a man shot his wife before turning the gun on himself now @entity3 has filed a petition to the @entity71 to continue her battle			1
her attorney @entity73 told @entity36 that they want to make the state realise ' that having a horrific event occur within a property can be just as damaging and troubling to a future homeowner as a physical defect , or perhaps even more so			1
' he added : ' having a gunshot murder - suicide committed within the home is much more devastating than having a small leak concealed by the previous homeowner			2
' physical defects can be fixed			0
troubling events that could and did occur in this home could never go away			0
' the battle stems from february 11 , 2006 , when @entity88 shot and killed his wife , then shot himself dead in the master bedroom of the @entity91 home , which they owned			1
their three young children were at home at the time , but were not harmed			0
on february 11 , 2006 , 50 - year - old @entity88 shot and killed his 34 - year - old wife , @entity97			1
he then turned the gun on himself and shot himself dead in the master bedroom of the home , which they owned			1
their three children , aged seven to 13 , were at home at the time , but were not harmed			0
police said the eldest child called 911 and the bodies were found around 8.30 a.m. after authorities arrived on the scene , the children were taken to state police barracks , where they were met by family			0
their home went to auction			0
eight months later the @entity114 , who knew about the killings , bought the home for $ 450,000 and later sold it to @entity3			1
she moved in with her two teenage children after her husband 's death			0
@entity73 said @entity3 , 59 , was ' disturbed ' when she found out the history of the home			1
as she wondered how to tell her children , they learned of the deaths from their friends			1
' they were very upset upon learning about it and disturbed about the whole situation , ' @entity73 said			0
' they were dealing with the death of a father and husband and wanted to move closer to family , and then this happened to them			0
it was a tragedy all around			0
' the family is still living at the home as they can not afford to move out			0
if they were to leave , they would have to tell the new buyers about the home 's history ' through good conscience ' , which would affect the value , @entity73 said			0
as he dissented to december 's @entity150 decision , judge @entity148 acknowledged the massive loss the family had suffered			1
' the financial penalty mrs. @entity3 has suffered was entirely avoidable had the sellers whom she bought her home merely exercised a little more integrity and a little less greed , ' he said			2
but @entity158 , the attorney for the @entity51 , said : ' the majority , en banc [ full - court ] opinion of the @entity150 was well reasoned and consistent with years of industry practice in @entity19			2
' the @entity150 opinion provides guidance for any real estate transaction in the future and puts to rest the uncertainty of whether a seller has a duty to disclose a murder - suicide or any other type " psychological damage "			1
in my opinion , the result is a good one			0

@entity3 , 59 , learned of the deaths from a neighbor after she moved in
a year earlier homeowner @entity88 , 50 , had shot dead his wife @entity97 before turning the gun on himself
trial judge and @entity150 ruled the realtor did not need to disclose the grisly past ; she is now taking the case to the state @entity8
