by @entity0 sir @entity1 : ' if your relationship is not stable enough to cope with children , you should not have them ' couples who want to have children should get married to provide a stable family environment , a high court judge said yesterday			1
sir @entity11 said would - be parents have ‘ responsibilities and duties to do right by [ children ] ’ , while also accusing politicians of displaying a ‘ high level of ignorance ’ towards the virtues of married life			1
the senior judge , who will retire from the bench next year after a career as a family lawyer and judge , said : ‘ if your relationship is not stable enough to cope with children , you should not have them			1
' if your relationship is stable enough to cope with the rigours of child rearing , then you should consider seriously adding the protection of marriage to your relationship			2
’ almost half of births in @entity36 and @entity37 are now from unmarried mothers , according to the @entity39 , which recorded a record figure of 47.5 per cent last year			1
the family court judge ’s remarks follow a report by a think - tank he founded warning that unmarried couples are four times as likely to break up than married couples			1
the research by the @entity49 also said unmarried couples accounted for more than half of family breakdowns			1
sir @entity1 , who has long been known for his strident , common - sense views on the issue of children and divorce , told the @entity57 that the lack of support from colleagues on his views around marriage was partly to blame for his decision to step down from the judiciary next year			1
while insisting that he did not mean to ‘ preach morality ’ , sir @entity1 said many in the upper echelons of the establishment believe that cohabitation and marriage are indistinguishable			1
he said : ‘ there is this idea out there that it does n’t make any difference whether you cohabit or marry [ to which i say ] no it does n’t – except one tends to last and the other tends not to last			0
’ sir @entity1 also criticised selfish parents for being more concerned with their own ‘ rights ’ than the welfare of their children			1
he said : ‘ in the courts people talk about their rights – you have no right where children are concerned			2
what you have are responsibilities and duties to do right by them			2
’ family values : children will benefit from having stable married parents , said sir @entity1 ( posed by models ) sir @entity1 , a family judge in the @entity96 ( pictured ) , insisted he was not ' preaching morality ' but blamed a lack of support for his views on marriage for his decision to step down from the judiciary next year despite his impassioned defence of marriage , sir @entity1 insisted that he was not suggesting that only those who are married should have children			1
he added : ‘ i do n’t think they should have children until they are sure that their relationship is stable enough to cope with the stresses and strains			2
’ almost six out of ten pregnancies in @entity36 and @entity37 were outside marriage in 2011 , records from the @entity39 showed			1
the 57 per cent of conceptions to women who were not married compared with 52 per cent in 2001 and 44 per cent in 1991			0
a higher proportion of conceptions outside marriage end in abortion than those among married women			2
the latest figures show that just under seven out of ten conceptions to unmarried women ended in a birth , compared to more than nine out of ten pregnancies among married women			2
motorbike enthusiast : sir @entity11 is a staunch defender of children after more than four decades in family law sir @entity11 , 64 , who is to retire after more than 40 years as a family lawyer and judge , has for years been an outspoken defender of children in family break - ups			1
last week the straight - talking lawyer called upon warring parents to think of the impact of divorce in terms of the ' sheer pain and human suffering ' it causes to children			2
he said : ' the children [ of divorce ] are given no choice , are never consulted , and only rarely considered before it and its effects are dumped into their young lives , slowly to release their legacy over the whole course of their upbringing and way beyond into their adult lives			0
' married to @entity156 since 1973 , he has three children and three grandchildren , and enjoys motorbikes , gardening and spending time in the @entity163 countryside			0
he says he and his wife have been through ' good times and bad times ' but says the key is to keep going			0
' people also seem to think good , stable marriages arrive fully formed and drop out of the sky , and if you 're lucky you 'll catch one , ' he said			0
' but actually , long , stable marriages are carved out of the rock of human stubbornness and selfishness and difficulties			0
the way you make them work is by chipping away bits over the years so you end up with something beautiful			0
' last year he set up the @entity49 think - tank to champion marriage as a source of strength for families with children			1
he said : ' i have seen the fall - out from these broken relationships			0
there are an estimated 3.8million children currently caught up in the family justice system			2
that is a complete scandal			0
' a year ago , sir @entity1 blamed the curse of @entity197 and other similar glossies for giving young people unrealistic expectations of marriage , saying aspirations based on celebrity lifestyle were ' dangerously flawed '			1
and in 2011 he said : ' divorce is easy in the sense that obtaining a divorce is easier than getting a driving licence			0
' it 's a form - filling exercise and you 'll get your divorce in six weeks if everyone agrees			0
' and he said there was no longer a stigma attached to divorce			0
' in about 1950 you were n't allowed in the royal enclosure at @entity219 if you were divorced , ' sir @entity1 said			0
' that now would exclude half the @entity221			0

sir @entity11 said parents should be close enough to endure marriage
percentage of children born to unmarried mothers in @entity36 and @entity37 reached record 47.5 last year
@entity96 family judge is stepping down after more than 40 years in family law , partly thanks to a ' lack of support '
he insisted he was not ' preaching morality ' but parents had responsibilities to provide *stability* for their children
