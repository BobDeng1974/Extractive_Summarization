@entity1 is suffering from ‘ squeaky bum time ’ in the race to win the next election , a shadow cabinet minister has admitted			2
@entity6 ’s admission , using the phrase made famous by the former @entity9 boss sir @entity8 , comes amid growing pressure on @entity12 ’s leadership in the wake of a series of poor polls			1
it comes as mr @entity12 attempted to bolster his election war chest – by selling off bizarre eco-friendly shopping bags emblazoned with a ‘ @entity1 ’ ceramic lion logo designed by the artist @entity20			1
@entity1 's shadow justice secretary @entity6 said it was ' squeaky bum time ' for the party ahead of the next general election in an email , party members are offered the chance to ‘ donate £ 19 towards a @entity1 victory now , and you 'll get your very own , special - edition @entity20 canvas bag / work of art ’			1
@entity1 is facing being heavily outspent by the @entity32 in the election campaign and is relying on large donations from the unions to compete			2
the @entity37 ’s financial muscle is adding to growing @entity1 concern that it is not far enough ahead in the polls to win a majority in may			2
mr @entity6 said it was time for mps concerned about mr @entity12 ’s leadership to ‘ get on the pitch and help us ’ instead of ‘ complaining from the sidelines ’			1
sir @entity8 ( right ) infamously described the closing stages of the 1996 @entity49 title race against @entity51 's @entity50 as ' squeaky bum time ' artist @entity20 donated a ceramic lion to the @entity53 , which was sold for £ 42,000 at a fundraising event in july			1
now the party has used the image of the lion on shopping bags to raise more cash an image of a ceramic lion designed by @entity20 is emblazoned on shopping bags being sold by @entity1 cross-dressing artist @entity20 is a long - time supporter of the @entity53			1
his £ 19 eco-friendly ‘ @entity1 ’ shopping bag uses an image of a ceramic lion which he donated to the party in july			1
the ornament was sold for £ 42,000 at a star - studded @entity1 fundraising event attended by left - wing actors , artists and tv stars			0
@entity73 actor @entity72 , @entity74 and @entity75 attended the fundraising ‘ gala ’ dinner			0
at the gala , one bidder is understood to have pledged more than £ 105,000 for artist @entity81 's ' @entity80 ' - a 106cm pillar of blocks made of cast iron			1
asked if he had seen evidence of unrest within @entity1 ranks , mr @entity6 told the @entity87 : ‘ there 's a great @entity8 saying ... where in a season when @entity9 and @entity50 were neck - and - neck , he said it 's squeaky bum time			1
and i think it 's squeaky bum time for @entity1			0
’ he added that in the past whenever @entity1 had lost an election , the party spends a lengthy period in opposition during which ‘ we fight among ourselves and often spilt ’			2
but he said : ‘ what we 're trying to do is something not done since 1974 - that 's to be a one - term opposition and bounce back from the second worst result in our history			0
‘ some of my colleagues need to recognise there 's no rule of politics that means you bounce back like a pendulum			0
‘ you 've got to have the humility to learn the right lessons , be proud of the things you got right and earn it			0
‘ we lost really badly and people forget that			0
but we 're competitive again , and we 've a great set of candidates and policies			0
politics is a team sport			0
it 's really easy to blame the leader			0
‘ we 've all got a role to play ... rather than people complaining on the sidelines , they should get on the pitch and help us win the election			2
’ mr @entity6 claimed some of his colleagues had failed to ‘ understand the rhythm of opposition ’ in the new fixed - term parliament era , while the leadership was working backwards from the may 7 election date with a plan to win			1
acknowledging the threat of division to @entity1 's chances , he appealed for calm to make sure the party did not ‘ wake up on may 8 saying “ if only we 'd been more united , if only we 'd been more disciplined ” ’			0
a @entity144 poll for the @entity145 and @entity146 on sunday put the party on 34 per cent , four points ahead of the @entity32			0
but only 20 per cent of those surveyed said they could imagine mr @entity12 as prime minister , a fall from 25 per cent a year ago .			1
