it may not be as fast as a @entity1 or as regal as a @entity2 but the most popular type of car in the world is 50 years old this year as the humble hatchback hits its half century			1
the car shape originally designed to help @entity9 farmers transport their sheep to market now accounts for a staggering two in every three cars sold in the @entity14			1
and it is just as popular across the world from @entity16 to @entity17 thanks to its practical design , economy and comfort			1
the model credited with being the world ’s first ever hatchback was the @entity25 16 unveiled in april 1965 the @entity26 : the forerunner to the @entity25 was first designed to allow @entity9 farmers to transport sheep the model credited with being the world ’s first ever hatchback was unveiled to the public with the launch of @entity9 ’s @entity25 in april 1965			1
now it accounts for a staggering two thirds of all new cars sold in @entity14 and a majority of those sold in most other markets from @entity36 to @entity37 and , increasingly , the @entity38 too			1
in the @entity14 , seven of the top ten sellers last year - including the top five - are classed as hatchbacks			1
this is defined as a car which has a boot that lifts up from the roof but the outline of the car is no bigger than if it were a standard saloon ( so estate cars and 4x4s are not classed as hatchbacks for instance			1
) yet when the first one went on sale in 1965 , the name hatchback did not even exist			1
it only came into use in the 70s as an alternative to the @entity58 term ‘ liftback ’ for such cars			2
the @entity25 was the first mass produced hatchback in the world			1
it was described by then @entity25 president @entity65 as a ‘ voiture a vivre ’ - a car for every aspect of life			1
@entity14 ’s answer to the pioneering @entity25 was the very similar looking , but poorly built , @entity70 ( pictured ) the very popular @entity71 by @entity72 was launched in 1980 and then relaunched in 1995 like the earlier @entity26 , the boot was hinged to the roof but unlike the @entity26 , the chassis had not been extended to facilitate this			1
there had been clique luxury cars with a similar boot but the @entity25 was revolutionary for a mass produced car with a hatch at the back and seats which folded down			2
and it became the first time cars were called either ‘ three door ’ or ‘ five door			2
’ the @entity89 focus the world 's best selling nameplate not only is the @entity92 the word 's best selling hatchback but also the best selling automobile nameplate in the world			2

in 2010 @entity89 decided to reunite both international and @entity58 models by releasing the international @entity99 worldwide			0
the previous @entity58 version was discontinued , and the new model was launched simultaneously in @entity58 and @entity36 in early 2011			0
as of the first half of 2012 , the @entity92 surpassed the @entity103 as the world 's best - seller @entity25 celebrated the car ’s 50th anniversary with a retrospective exhibition in @entity109 this week			1
it said : “ the goal was to design a high - end mid-sized car that would set itself completely apart from the opposition : a family car adapted to every aspect of modern life , boasting the functionality and versatility of an estate while delivering the comfort and elegance of a saloon car			2
” the car was a critical and commercial success leading to generations of copycat rivals			2
better rivals came from @entity37 - the @entity127 ( pictured ) along with the @entity128 and the @entity129 @entity14 ’s answer to it was the very similar looking , but poorly built , @entity70			1
it was so poor that even the factory workers at the time were reluctant to use their company discount to own one			0
better rivals came from @entity37 - the @entity127 , @entity128 and the @entity129 which became one of the world ’s best selling cars of the 70s			1
the @entity140 followed with the @entity141 , which later became the @entity143 and the early @entity144 , a forerunner to the massively successful @entity146			0
the @entity146 and the @entity147 from the golden age of the hatchback as a cult car @entity89 brought out its own bestseller , the @entity151 and @entity152 launched the @entity154			2
@entity36 motorists snapped up hatchbacks by the million			0
@entity58 took longer to get the hatchback bug			0
cheap petrol and a love of gas guzzling motors and pick ups meant they were reluctant to change at first			0
gradually throughout the 1970s , most major manufacturers began to bring out hatchback versions of existing saloons , like the @entity166 and @entity167			0
the @entity38 finally followed suit with hatchback versions of their most popular cars including the @entity171 and @entity172			1
@entity173 manufacturere @entity152 launched its hatchback the @entity154 to challenge @entity36 rivals in 1983 then in the 80s came the @entity71 and perhaps the most popular hatchback of all time , the @entity146 , which is still made to this day			2
this was also the decade which saw the arrival of the ‘ @entity182 ’ - souped up @entity146 versions of popular hatchback models including the @entity146 and @entity185 205 , which became synonymous with yuppies and so - called ‘ boy racers			1
’ now , hatchbacks are both popular and highly rated			0

“ for a vast majority of buyers the added practicality offered by a hatchback is a necessity , and despite the rise in sales of supposedly more upmarket saloons we see no reason for that trend to change			0
” of 2.26 million cars sold in the @entity14 last year , 1.5 million were hatchbacks			1
of the top ten best sellers , the top five were hatchbacks - the @entity151 and @entity92 from @entity89 , the @entity233 and @entity143 by @entity143 and the @entity146			0
