by @entity0 for @entity1 when it comes to adding up it 's experience that counts , scientists have found			1
@entity6 carried out on elementary school - age children has revealed that drilling children on simple addition and multiplication may pay off			1
according to the results , as children 's brains develop remembering sums helps them add up faster			1
' experience really does matter , ' said dr @entity16 of the @entity17 , which funded the research			0
third grade teacher @entity19 teaches a math lesson at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 healthy children start making that switch between counting to what 's called fact retrieval when they 're eight to nine - years - old , when they 're still working on fundamental addition and subtraction			1
how well children make that shift to memory - based problem - solving is known to predict their ultimate math achievement			2
those who fall behind ' are impairing or slowing down their math learning later on , ' @entity16 said			0
but why do some children make the transition easier than others ? to start finding out , @entity40 researchers first peeked into the brains of 28 children as they solved a series of simple addition problems inside a brain - scanning mri machine			1
no scribbling out the answer : the seven to nine - year - olds saw a calculation — three plus four equals seven , for example — flash on a screen and pushed a button to say if the answer was right or wrong			2
scientists recorded how quickly they responded and what regions of their brain became active as they did			2
in a separate session , they also tested the children face - to - face , watching if they moved their lips or counted on their fingers , for comparison with the brain data			1
the children were tested twice , roughly a year apart			2
as the children got older , their answers relied more on memory and became faster and more accurate , and it showed in the brain			2
@entity40 researchers studied elementary school - age children by setting them tasks inside a brain - scanning mri machine ( file picture ) there was less activity in the prefrontal and parietal regions associated with counting and more in the brain 's memory center , the hippocampus , the researchers reported in @entity80			1
the hippocampus is sort of like a relay station where new memories come in — short - term working memory — and then can be sent elsewhere for longer - term storage and retrieval			2
those hippocampal connections increased with the kids ' math performance			0
' the stronger the connections , the greater each individual 's ability to retrieve facts from memory , ' said dr @entity93 , a psychiatry professor at @entity40 and the study 's senior author			1
but that 's not the whole story			0
next , @entity93 's team put 20 adolescents and 20 adults into the mri machines and gave them the same simple addition problems			1
it turns out that adults do n't use their memory - crunching hippocampus in the same way			0
instead of using a lot of effort , retrieving six plus four equals 10 from long - term storage was almost automatic , @entity93 said			0
in other words , over time the brain became increasingly efficient at retrieving facts			0
think of it like a bumpy , grassy field , @entity17 's @entity16 explained			0
walk over the same spot enough and a smooth , grass - free path forms , making it easier to get from start to end			1
if your brain does n't have to work as hard on simple maths , it has more working memory free to process the teacher 's brand - new lesson on more complex math. ' the study provides new evidence that this experience with math actually changes the hippocampal patterns , or the connections			1
they become more stable with skill development , ' she said			0
' so learning your addition and multiplication tables and having them in rote memory helps			0
' quiz your child in different orders , she advised — nine times three and then 10 times nine — to make sure they really remember and did n't have to think it through			0
while the study focuses on math , @entity16 said cognitive development in general probably works the same way			0
after all , kids who match sounds to letters earlier learn to read faster			0
@entity40 's @entity93 said the next step is to study what goes wrong with this system in children with math learning disabilities , so that scientists might try new strategies to help them learn .			1

@entity40 researchers studied elementary school - age children
they set them adding up tasks inside a brain - scanning mri machine
it was found healthy children start making a switch at 8 to 9 years old
at that point they use what 's called fact retrieval to solve problems
