@entity1 cockfighting promoters on friday kicked off an event billed as the largest exhibition of the bloodsport the country has ever seen			2
the annual @entity6 , which takes places on the eastern fringes of @entity9 , will see 16 nightly bouts of cockfighting over the space of a month – all of which end in the death of one of the animals			1
trainers from all over the country compete not only for the title of best trainer , but also to keep alive what they claim is a proud @entity1 tradition despite demands to ban the ' disgusting ' sport			1
' we want to showcase the proud tradition to our visitors '			1
the event , which includes fairground attractions and one of @entity9 's biggest horse auctions , expects to receive more than 600,000 visitors over the month			1
' banning these events will never be accepted by the public ' , said @entity61 , a @entity62 resident who looks forward to the annual fair every year			0
' this year they want to make clear how much the people love to come and watch quality cockfights '			0
while cockfighting is banned in all 50 @entity70 states and @entity71 ( it was banned in @entity73 in 1835 ) , it nevertheless draws big crowds in @entity9 , where fans come to gamble on the fights and drink until the early hours of the morning			1
male birds are vicious and often emerge from the scuffles with their beaks filled with other 's feathers ' we train our animals to attack with their legs and feet first , and use the beak to finish the job later ' the dominant bird at this stage of the fight has ripped away some feathers from his stricken opponent starting on the edge of the arena , the gamecocks are shown to one another , producing aggressive crowing , before being placed in their respective corners and let loose to attack one another a cock struts proudly in the ring , though it will only take one blow from a razor blade to strike him down the gamecocks are displayed to the gamblers by being paraded around the circular arena before the fights cockfighting is also banned within the limits of @entity9 , four cities in the state of @entity114 and @entity116 state on the @entity118 border , but the bloodsport is nevertheless extremely popular in more rural areas of the country			1

' cockfighting is a family business ' , said @entity128 , a gamecock trainer from @entity129 , one of the eight gamecock - producing ranches competing on the fair 's opening night			2
' we get a good reception wherever we perform and people always come out to witness the spectacle			0
it always produces a good party atmosphere '			0
@entity128 had already seen two of his prize gamecocks die against superior opponents that evening , and was engaged in strapping the curved razorblade of @entity1 cockfighting regulation onto the left leg of his third bird			1
' the razorblades make for more interesting fights ' , he told the @entity48 as he spat on the rooster 's head , a common technique to anger the bird before it enters the battle			2
' we train our animals to attack with their legs and feet first , and use the beak to finish the job later '			2
the cuurved weapons attached to the birds ' legs must be changed every five minutes in order to ensure they are not left blunted by the sand of the arena @entity165 of blood cover the floor of the cockfighting ring , surrounded by fans enjoying drinks and snacks the cocks often scrap furiously on the floor of the arena , which is covered in blood from previous fights ' @entity178 these events will never be accepted by the public ' , according to @entity61 , a @entity62 resident who looks forward to the annual fair every year the cockfighting areana , known as a palenque , in @entity6 has a capacity of more than 3,000 people , and few seats were left unsold as the public clamoured to see the opening event of the month - long celebration the weapons attached to the birds ' legs must be changed every five minutes in order to ensure they are not left blunted by the sand of the arena			1
' it 's a disgusting practice and there 's no reason that it should continue simply because it 's seen as tradition ' , said @entity200 , a leader of the @entity202 animal rights organisation , in a telephone interview with the @entity48			1
@entity200 's organisation , which works closely with @entity9 's ecologist @entity205 , is currently petitioning the government to put an end to animal cruelty in the country			1

the flurry of feathers , beaks and claws is rapid and furious			0
the male birds are extremely vicious and often emerge from the scuffles with their beaks filled with other 's feathers			0
even if a bird is injured and not attempting to fight any longer , it is permitted only a 15 second recovery period before being placed within a yard of its opponent and forced to continue			1
the flurry of feathers , beaks and claws , when it comes , is rapid and furious and fights are always to - the - death the sport revolves entirely around gambling , and betting odds are always 2:1 on the fight 's outcome ' sometimes it comes down to luck			1
a weak bird might land a fatal blow with the razor and it 's all over ' a fight is declared over only when one of the birds is lying dead on the arena floor			2
the sport revolves entirely around gambling , and betting odds are always 2:1 on the fight 's outcome			0
the gamecocks are displayed to the gamblers by being paraded around the circular arena , before being placed in front of a non-competitor mona ( ' monkey ' ) gamecock to allow the gamblers to gauge their reactions			0
' the more aggressively they peck , scratch and display their neck feathers at the mona , the more likely it is that they will be a good fighter ' , said @entity279 , an observer in the crowd who had quadrupled his money over the previous two fights			0
' but sometimes it comes completely down to luck			0
a weak bird might land a fatal blow with the razor and it 's all over '			0
bookmakers patrol the circular arena taking bets whenever a fight is not in progress			0
the high - rollers are always invited to seats within five rows of the arena and bookies ' fees are negotiated depending on the size of the bets			0

following 16 cockfights , each ending with the bloodied loser unceremoniously dumped in a cement bucket , one of @entity9 's most famous bands ' @entity340 azules ' ( @entity342 ) took the animals ' place to play to a packed house			2
the fair will culminate with three shows by @entity349 , one of @entity351 's most famous artists and a @entity353 crooner , from april 9 to 11			0
