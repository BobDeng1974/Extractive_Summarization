by @entity0 published : 09:05 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 12:41 est , 31 january 2014 it was double joy for one mother after she was given the cancer all - clear on the same day as she discovered that her son had been picked for @entity8 's rugby union team			1
@entity9 , 64 , of @entity10 , was celebrating the @entity8 call for 26 - year - old @entity14 centre @entity12			1
but just hours after hearing of his call - up , there were tears of relief as doctors gave mrs @entity9 good news about her illness , telling her that tests showed that she was in the clear			1
@entity24 and @entity9 have two things to celebrate : @entity9 has been given the cancer all - clear and their son has just been selected for this weekend 's @entity8 game @entity12 is expected to run out for @entity8 in the @entity30 in @entity31 on saturday afternoon in the @entity33 opener against @entity30 - and he would n't have ever played rugby if it was n't for his mother			1
when @entity12 found out on monday that he had been selected for his @entity8 debut , he had cause to be grateful for the angry email his mother , @entity9 , sent @entity39 many years ago			1
the @entity14 centre was 15 at the time and had been overlooked by @entity42 , where the man who is now national coach was in charge of the academy			1
mrs @entity9 was not amused , as @entity46 soon realised			0
stung by her message , he invited @entity12 in for a trial and his rugby career took off from there			0
now , as he prepares for a daunting first @entity53 appearance in saturday 's @entity33 opener against @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity12 recalled the episode			1
‘ when i was 15 , one of my team - mates at @entity10 managed to get picked up by @entity42 ’ elite player development scheme , ’ he said			2
‘ i was pretty unhappy about it so i went home and had a bit of a sulk to my parents			0
my mother said , “ i ’m not having this ” , and fired an email across to the secretary at @entity42			0
it got to @entity39 , he got back and invited me to a trial			0
@entity9 is celebrating the @entity8 call for 26 - year - old @entity14 centre @entity12 @entity9 was diagnosed with suspected cancer in november but medics told her yesterday that she had got the all clear ‘ i had the trial a couple of weeks later and i have n’t looked back since			1
i owe a lot to my parents anyway - for driving me around , up and down the country , and i owe a lot to my mum for writing that email as well ! ’ but for weeks , it seemed likely that @entity9 would miss his big day because of the hospital appointments scheduled in for the same week			2
now @entity9 and husband @entity24 hope to be on the touchline for kick - off , although they say their plans are still unconfirmed , as they were forced to leave booking tickets , travel and accommodation until the very last minute			2
' i was very emotional when he went to @entity91 with the @entity8 team recently , ' said @entity9			2
' that was a big thing but this has always been his ultimate aim so it will be very emotional seeing him step out on to the turf if we are able to go			0
' it was also an emotional moment for @entity9 and @entity24 , who were given the news of their son 's triumph at their @entity105 home			2
mother - of - two @entity9 said : ' i got the first call from @entity12 at 5.15pm on tuesday when he rang and said : " i ’m giving you the heads - up , mum , i may be going to @entity30			1
" ' he said he would ring me later that evening and at 8pm he called to say : " i ’m getting my cap , mum			0
" ' my 11 - year - old granddaughter @entity111 was here at the time and she was just jumping around with joy			0
she is so proud of him as we all are			0
' @entity9 is unsure if they will make it to the match in @entity30 as they may have left it too late to book flights @entity12 has been edging towards his first @entity8 cap for some time , impressing with his consistently excellent performances for @entity14 , right , pictured age 16 being selected is a dream come true for @entity12 , who becomes the first @entity10 player to represent @entity8 at rugby union since @entity128 , who made his international debut against @entity130 at @entity131 on in 1947			1
@entity12 , who is 6ft 3in and weighs over 17st , has been edging towards his first @entity8 cap for some time , impressing with his consistently excellent performances for @entity14			1
prior to that , he made 12 appearances in an injury - hit 2011 - 12 season for @entity135			0
since he joined the @entity14 , he has made massive strides forward and , last summer , was called up for the @entity8 tour of @entity138			2
@entity9 is celebrating the @entity8 call for 26 - year - old @entity14 centre @entity12 ( pictured here aged 15 ) this season , he has consistently impressed at @entity14 , where he has been playing in the number 12 jersey and starts ahead of @entity143 , who is included on the bench			1
in his first media interview , the personable 26 - year - old told @entity145 that it had been a long journey to achieving his ultimate goal			0
asked if he had stopped pinching himself he said : ' i ’m absolutely over the moon , i ca n’t believe it has finally come true			0
