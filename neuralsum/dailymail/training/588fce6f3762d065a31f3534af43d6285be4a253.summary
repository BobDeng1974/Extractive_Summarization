sci - fi fans might have hidden behind a cushion or sent popcorn flying the first time they watched @entity5 and a ' chestburster ' violently erupted from a human host 's ribcage			1
but a creature that looks almost as horrifying has been spotted in a lake in @entity11			2
the rare purple eel goby has a face not dissimilar to the fictional alien but is much less violent and feeds on crustaceans instead of humans			1
it is amphidromous and regularly migrates between freshwater and the sea , but unlike similar animals , its journeys are not essential as part of a breeding ritual			2
an amphidromous creature reproduces in fresh water , but spends a period of time feeding and growing at sea , usually lasting for a few months			0
it then returns to freshwater before a further period of feeding and growing in freshwater , followed by reproduction there			0
in its lifetime , the strange creature can cover over 100 kilometres on its cyclical and predictable journeys			2
it is a mud - dweller that is bizarrely capable of living out of the water for a a considerable time by taking air into the bronchial chambers			0
the purple eel goby can grow up to 30 centimetres long and feeds on a mixture of crustaceans , small fish and small invertebrates			1
the ugly fish was discovered in @entity35 in @entity36 , eastern @entity11 's @entity37 , which is unusual as the creature has previously been found in coastal waters , estuaries and rivers			1
here you can see its tiny eyes and strong jaw its is predominantly found in coastal waters and estuaries in offshore islands of @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , but has also been spotted in @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			0
perhaps due to its frightening appearance , the animal is not widely caught and eaten			0
the creature looks a little like a ' chestburster ' from the @entity5 films , which feature fictional predatory extraterrestrials which aim on propagating their species and destroying life that could pose a threat to their survival			1
in the film , the alien 's life - cycle involves the hatching of a parasitic larvae called a ' facehugger , ' which attaches itself to a living host and then grows within a human before bursting through the unfortunate person 's chest			1
the ' chestburster ' then matures into a terrifying adult which takes on some of its host 's physical attributes to adapt to its new environment			0
the creature is amphidromous and regularly migrates between freshwater and the sea , but unlike similar animals , its journeys are not essential as part of a breeding ritual			2
here you can see its underside , which features a sucker - like fin			0

a rare purple eel goby was discovered in eastern @entity11 's @entity37
it feeds on crustaceans , small fish and invertebrates using its scary jaws
the unusual animal can cover over 100 kilometers on its journeys between the sea and *sources* of freshwater *inland*
*resembles* parasitic larvae from the @entity5 films that grows inside a human host then bursts out of the unfortunate person 's chest
