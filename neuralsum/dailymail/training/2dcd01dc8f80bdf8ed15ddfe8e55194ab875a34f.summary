by @entity0 published : 15:50 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 08:33 est , 7 february 2013 criticism : @entity2 , who previously supported @entity4 founder @entity3 , became the first of his backer 's to criticise him @entity2 became the first celebrity backer of @entity3 to publicly criticise his decision to jump bail and seek refuge in the @entity11			1
she said his ‘ instantaneous rock - star status ’ made him feel he was ‘ above the law and exempt from criticism ’ , even likening him to scientologist l @entity13			2
nearly eight months after the @entity4 founder took up residence in the diplomatic building , miss @entity2 , who put up bail money for @entity3 , laid bare her frustrations at his attempts to dodge extradition to @entity25 where he is wanted over rape and sex assault allegations			1
she gave an extraordinary insight into how @entity3 , whose whistleblowing website angered @entity30 by releasing thousands of @entity32 diplomatic cables in 2010 , has alienated some of his staunchest allies			2
in a reference to fictional spy @entity36 , she said : ‘ i jokingly asked if @entity3 was the new @entity36 , on the run and persecuted by the state			2
‘ it would be a tragedy if a man who has done so much good were to end up tolerating only disciples and unwavering devotion , more like an @entity44 @entity13			2
’ miss @entity2 , 39 , described how she had previously supported @entity3 - even after he was arrested over the claims in late 2010			1
but the socialite and former wife of cricket star @entity48 now says that his female accusers have ‘ human rights ’ , too , and that she had gone from “ admiration to demoralisation ” on the subject of @entity4			1
she said in the @entity54 : ‘ the timing of the rape allegations and the issuing of the @entity59 arrest warrant for @entity3 in november 2010 initially seemed suspicious to many , including me			0
' they came just two days after the release of the first batch of embarrassing state department cables			0
’ rock star status : miss @entity2 referred to @entity3 's ‘ instantaneous rock - star status ’ and likened him to founding scientologist l @entity13 she went on : ‘ it may well be that the serious allegations of sexual assault and rape are not substantiated in court , but i have come to the conclusion that these are all matters for @entity25 due process and that @entity3 is undermining both himself and his own transparency agenda – as well as doing the @entity32 department of justice a favour – by making his refusal to answer questions in @entity25 into a human rights issue			1
‘ there have been three rounds in the @entity83 courts and the @entity83 courts have upheld the @entity85 in his name three times			0
‘ the women in question have human rights , too , and need resolution			0
@entity3 ’s noble cause and his wish to avoid a @entity32 court does not trump their right to be heard in a @entity25 court			0
‘ i do n’t regret putting up bail money for @entity3 but i did it so that he would be released while awaiting trial , not so that he could avoid answering to the allegations			2
’ asylum : @entity3 making a speech outside the @entity103 in @entity104 where he has sought political asylum miss @entity2 did not reveal how much bail money she put up for @entity3 although it has previously been reported she promised as much as £ 20,000			1
in august last year , two months after he went into hiding at the @entity108 embassy , the fugitive , 41 , emerged on the building ’s balcony to portray himself as a martyr for free speech who faced oppression from a ‘ war on whistle - blowers ’			0
in a rambling speech , he accused the @entity32 of a ‘ witch - hunt ’ that threatened freedom of expression			0
undermining : miss @entity2 , who is associate editor of the @entity54 , said @entity3 is ' undermining both himself and his transparency agenda ' ironically , he then thanked a roll - call of @entity127 countries , most of which are routinely criticised for their appalling track record over freedom of speech and human rights			1
it was the first time he had been seen in public since he walked into the embassy last june to claim asylum			0
miss @entity2 , who is associate editor of the @entity136 , said : ‘ the problem is that @entity4 – whose mission statement was “ to produce			1
based upon truth ” – has been guilty of the same obfuscation and misinformation as those it sought to expose , while its supporters are expected to follow , unquestioningly , in blinkered , cultish devotion			1
’ she said that in august last year , she tried several times to ask @entity3 to address points about his extradition battle which had been made by a @entity54 colleague , but he snubbed each attempt			0
‘ i was told that @entity3 was “ very busy ” , though i was invited to visit the @entity108 embassy , where he had recently taken refuge to avoid extradition , for a photo opportunity , which i declined , ’ she said			0
‘ i have seen flashes of @entity3 ’s charm , brilliance and insightfulness – but i have also seen how instantaneous rock - star status has the power to make even the most clear - headed idealist feel that they are above the law and exempt from criticism			0
’ @entity3 was arrested in @entity83 in december 2010 on an extradition warrant from @entity25			0
after losing a protracted legal battle to avoid extradition , which went all the way to @entity83 ’s @entity173 , @entity3 jumped bail and sought refuge in the @entity108 embassy in @entity104 last june			2
he has been inside the building ever since			0
in october last year , a number of @entity3 ’s supporters were ordered to forfeit £ 93,500 in bail money after the @entity4 founder skipped bail			1
ms @entity2 was executive producer of a documentary film about @entity4 entitled “ @entity184 ” which recently premiered at the @entity185 in the @entity32			1
she said the film , directed by @entity189 - winning documentary maker @entity187 , sought to present a balanced view of the @entity4 story but @entity3 had denounced it before seeing it .			1

said she had gone from ' admiration to demoralisation ' regarding the site
miss @entity2 said its supporters were expected to follow in ' cultish devotion '
