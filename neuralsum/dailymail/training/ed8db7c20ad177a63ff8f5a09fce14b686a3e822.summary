@entity0 is off the mark in @entity3 's @entity2 after taking two wickets for @entity5 in their one - run win over the @entity7			1
@entity0 took a battering in the last of his four overs as @entity7 ' left - hander @entity9 smashed 21 runs in his almost match - winning innings of 43 from 31 balls			2
that flurry made his figures of 2 - 41 look expensive , but his scalps - dangerous big - hitters @entity15 and @entity18 - taken as the @entity7 mounted a late charge were invaluable to his side 's win			1
@entity0 celebrates one of his two wickets for @entity5 in their one - run win over @entity7 it was a marked improvement on @entity0 's first appearance for the @entity5 which saw a third - ball duck and his two overs going for 12.5 apiece as @entity28 and @entity29 smashed 96 and 97 not out respectively for the @entity30			1
@entity0 claimed @entity15 , a figure who haunts many an international @entity34 side for his late - innings heroics , with a ball full on middle and off that caught a leading edge that floated to the safe hands of @entity41 at extra cover			0
with the last ball of that third over @entity0 went wide of the crease to @entity18 , who in trying a desperate heave over mid-wicket managed only to be clean bowled			0
@entity9 crushed 43 from 31 balls , including 21 from a single @entity0 over , in @entity7 ' chase despite @entity9 's heroics , the @entity7 fell one run short in their attempt to run down the @entity51 for eight @entity0 was earlier run out from the last ball of the @entity5 's innings as they finished with 164 for 8 , with @entity55 top - scoring with 48 from 34 balls			1
coming on first change , 37 - year - old @entity0 was relatively tight as @entity59 's @entity58 got @entity7 ' chase off to a decent start with 33 from 23 balls before being caught by hopes from @entity64			0
in the penultimate over of the chase , @entity65 took a single to bring in - form @entity9 on strike and the @entity70 who was dumped from @entity3 's test team after two matches unleashed			0
@entity18 batsman @entity18 is bowled while attempting to heave @entity0 over midwicket @entity0 earlier scored 15 - bettering his previous duck - before being run out from the last ball of the innings @entity9 crushed two sixes and a four ( only one other boundary came from @entity0 's bowling ) , along with a pair of twos			2
@entity65 got @entity9 on strike again with the first ball of @entity85 's closing over , but @entity9 could manage just one six and got three ( after being dropped at midwicket ) when he needed five from the last ball .			0

@entity0 took 2 - 41 after being hit for 21 runs in his last over
they were @entity0 's first wickets in @entity3 's @entity2
@entity5 *defeated* @entity7 by one run on *sunday*
