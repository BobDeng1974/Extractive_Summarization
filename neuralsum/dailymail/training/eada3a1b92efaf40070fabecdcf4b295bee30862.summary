by @entity0 published : 05:21 est , 21 august 2013 @entity2 : 11:16 est , 21 august 2013 a network of tunnels that make up what appears to be an underground city have been discovered buried deep beneath the villa of @entity8 near @entity9			1
archaeospeleologists have begun charting the underground roads and believe the passageways would have been used by carts and wagons pulled by oxen to transport slaves , food and other goods below the estate 's 296 acres of land out of sight from the @entity8			1
the villa at @entity23 , near @entity9 , was built by @entity8 in the @entity24 and was made up of 30 buildings such as palaces , living quarters , spas , pavilions and libraries , each surrounded by ornate gardens , pools and fountains			1
archaeologists have mapped more than a mile of tunnels , right , discovered beneath @entity37 in @entity9 used to transport slaves , cattle and food out of sight from the @entity8			1
the main tunnel , pictured left , runs for half a mile to a 700 metre circular spur that may have been used to turn carts around this map shows the layout of @entity8 's villa estate			1
the first tunnels to be discovered at the start of this century are marked in blue and travel from the @entity53 to the @entity54			2
the second , red tunnels travel away from the @entity54			2
the green roads travel underground from the entrance hall to the piazza			0
the yellow line is the newly - discovered tunnel that is 2.4 - metres wide and dubbed @entity61 the main tunnel , mapped by caver @entity63 and a team from the @entity67 di @entity66 association of archaeospeleologists including @entity69 , is 10 - foot wide , runs for more than half a mile in a north - easterly direction before switching south and leads to a 700 - metre circular spur			1
experts believe this spur may have been used as a turning circle for the carts and wagons			2
the passage has been dubbed @entity78 , which means @entity61 in @entity80 , and is larger than the other tunnels previously discovered under the estate			2
it was uncovered when archaeologists found a hole buried beneath bushes and plants along a pathway to the main gallery			1
because some sections of the tunnel are blocked by debris and rocks that have fallen into them over time , the archaeologists also used wire - controlled robots fitted with cameras to explore regions they could n't reach			2
another , larger tunnel was also found during the exploration that is 16 - foot wide and could have been used as a dual road			1
the main tunnel , mapped by caver @entity63 , pictured , and a team from the @entity67 di @entity66 association runs in a north - easterly direction before switching south beneath the 296 acres of the @entity106 's estate @entity8 's @entity106 was built at @entity23 , which is now known as @entity23 , around 20 miles to the east of @entity9			1
it was used as a retreat for @entity8 during @entity24			1
the villa was started in @entity110			0
towards the end of his reign , @entity8 governed the empire from the villa and built a court in order to have official meetings			1
when the @entity118 fell the palace was looted and damaged but the underground network is ' almost intact '			2
the estate is made of over 30 building covering around 296 acres and includes palaces , thermae 's ( spas ) , theatres , temples , libraries , slave and courtier quarters			2
there is also a pool and an artificial grotto named @entity134 and @entity135 , respectively ( pictured )			0
it was named after the @entity138 city of @entity134 where a temple , called @entity135 , was dedicated to the @entity140			0
in 1998 , archaeologists discovered a temple built in honour of god @entity144			0
the villa was declared a @entity147 by @entity148 in 1999 and officials are working to clear the tunnels and offer tours of the passageways by the end of the year			0
however , there was too much soil and debris in the tunnel for the explorers to enter and will be cleared at a later date to see where it leads to			0
the villa was declared a @entity147 by @entity148 in 1999 and officials are working to clear the tunnels so they can offer tours of the passageways by the end of the year			0
archaeologists realised there was a network of roads under the estate because wells were situated along the paths every 50ft in a uniform pattern			0
it was originally believed that a single road travelled from the terrace of the @entity178 statue in the grounds to the circular spur			1
the new tunnel entrance discovered suggests that there were also alternative underground routes			0
other discoveries include the footprint of a baby on the cover plate at the end of one tunnel as well as a shell from the @entity191 found beneath the @entity135 , or religious temple			1
some of the tunnels under @entity37 were too small for the team to fully explore so the archaeospeleologists used wire - mounted robots fitted with cameras to track and map the areas they could n't reach one of the many thermae , or spas , located in the ground of @entity37			0
when the @entity118 fell the palace was looted and damaged but the underground network is ' almost intact ' archaeologists realised there was a network of roads under the estate because wells were situated along the paths every 50ft in a uniform pattern experts believe these decorated dishes may have been used to serve to the emperor , or used as souvenirs			0
emperor @entity8 , who also built @entity216 in the north of @entity218 , designed his villa based on palaces he 'd seen in @entity138 and @entity221			1
the villa was started in @entity110			0
when the @entity118 fell the palace was looted and damaged but the underground network is ' almost intact '			0
@entity225 told @entity227 newspaper , ' the underground network helps us to understand the structures that are above ground			0
' ' all the majesty of the villa is reflected in the subsoil			0
