@entity8 must ‘ reserve the right to investigate subjects of no practical use whatsoever ’ to aid students ’ pursuit of knowledge , its vice chancellor claimed yesterday			1
professor @entity9 defended learning for learning ’s sake , arguing that intellectual curiosity can spark off a ‘ hundred unexpected developments ’			1
he used his annual oration to the university ’s @entity15 - the university ’s legislative body - to insist that ‘ learning with no apparent practical use ’ sometimes ‘ yields the greatest benefit ’			1
his comments fly in the face of a government drive to encourage more students to take up vital @entity26 subjects needed for the economy such as science , technology , engineering and maths as well as work - based apprenticeships			1
@entity8 ( pictured ) must reserve the right to investigate subjects of ' no practical use whatsoever ' , vice chancellor professor @entity9 has said professor @entity9 's comments came during his annual oration to the university ’s legislative body professor @entity9 said that @entity8 was ‘ almost defined by its ability to set problems with no apparent solution ’			1
he said : ‘ there will be many occasions when we are challenged about the real - world benefits of our work			2
‘ when someone asks : ‘ what is the earthly use of knowing that ? ’ we should be strong enough , and confident enough to reply : ‘ you know , i ’ve absolutely no idea what use it might be			1
but is n’t it fascinating ? ’ ’ the vice chancellor cited research by academics in the university ’s @entity58 , which recently estimated the body masses of 426 species of dinosaur			1
the team , along with international partners , discovered that those evolutionary lines which reduced fastest in size had the greatest survival success			2
professor @entity9 said : ‘ there are 10,000 species of dinosaur alive and around us today – only we call them birds			2
‘ now , unless you ’re a budgerigar wishing to trace your family tree , that information is of precisely zero practical value			2
yet it ’s brilliant research and , somehow , i feel better just for knowing it			0
’ other academics in the @entity80 have been investigating the relationship between the electrical and optical properties of materials than can change from amorphous to crystalline states			0
they discovered that a seven nanometre - thick layer of one of these materials was suitable as an extremely high - resolution and flexible screen			0
professor @entity9 also criticized the government 's ' hostile ' international student visa regulations ‘ the potential applications are countless – smart glasses , smart windshields , even synthetic retinas , ’ said professor @entity9			1
‘ a patent has been filed and the team are in the early stages of exploring the commercial applications			0
‘ none of this was ever intended – it ’s purely a by - product of the drive to know			0
’ meanwhile , in the 1920s , two members of @entity8 ’s @entity113 faculty , one from @entity114 , another from @entity115 , ‘ would talk late into the night , exploring their mutual interest in @entity109 ’			1
professor @entity9 added : ‘ from those beginnings , @entity116 and @entity117 both wrote a series of books loved the world over which have inspired film franchises grossing more than $ 6.5billion at the box office			0
’ these academics ‘ did n’t have an inkling ’ that their ‘ intellectual curiosity ’ could spark such phenomena			0
however , professor @entity9 warned that it is ‘ still all too rare ’ to hear @entity130 described as ‘ just about the most important investment a nation can make on behalf of its citizens ’			0
he said : ‘ that ’s why i have somewhat limited expectation , come the general election , that properly developed policies on higher education ( as opposed to vain - glorious point - scoring on past crimes and misdemeanours ) will take up much of the politicians ’ time or attention			0
‘ that ’s sad – because it is exactly the sort of issue on which a real effort to find a new , meaningful consensus between the parties would be of immense benefit – benefit , of course , to the students and to the universities of the future , but also … hugely beneficial to the public good			1
’ he also attacked the government ’s tightening of student visa regulations , which he believes is directly harming @entity162 interests			1
he said : ‘ wherever i travel in the world , particularly in @entity166 and @entity167 , one question persists			0
‘ why has the @entity162 adopted a visa system so hostile to student entry ? i do my best to answer but , frankly , the question baffles me as well			1
‘ for the first time in decades , the number of international students at our universities has dropped , most markedly from @entity167			2
why are we doing this to them – and to ourselves ? ’ @entity178 winner , @entity177 , also warned yesterday ( tues ) that the @entity162 government ’s policies on immigration and animal research were risking the country ’s scientific standing			2
the @entity187 - born neuroscientist won the prize for rat research into the brain ’s inner ‘ gps system ’			0
he said immigration rules were ‘ a very , very large obstacle ’ to hiring the best scientists , and animal testing rules could prevent vital research .			0

@entity8 must retain right to teach subjects of no practical benefit
vice chancellor has *staunchly* defended idea of learning for learning 's sake
government is encouraging more students to take up practical subjects
he also attacked the government 's ' hostile ' student visa regulations
