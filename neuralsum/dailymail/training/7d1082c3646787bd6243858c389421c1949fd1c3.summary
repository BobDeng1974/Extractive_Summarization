the @entity1 government is set to close the digital divide between the city and the bush by launching rockets and satellites into space to speed up internet connection speeds			1
in a first for @entity1 , the @entity9 has announced work is complete on all ten of its ground stations and the the first rocket will be launched in the next few months			1
the first satellite , which is the size of a large four - wheel - drive , will be shot into space from @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , in @entity19 , by @entity20			1
the satellites should ensure internet services to 400,000 @entity1 homes and 1,600 public buildings including 1,400 schools will be vastly improved			1
@entity40 's satellite architect , @entity39 told @entity41 only a handful of these type of satellites have been launched into orbit , and they have all returned excellent results			2
the satellites will appear stationary to anyone looking at them from earth , however they will be orbiting about 36,000 kilometres above the equator			0
the main body of the satellites is about the size of a small bus or a large four - wheel - drive and the solar panels that extend from then measure about 26 metres - the length of a cricket pitch			1
in a first for @entity1 , the @entity9 has announced work is complete on all ten of it 's ground stations and the the first rocket will be launched in the next few months @entity40 's satellite architect , @entity39 ( pictured ) told @entity41 that only a handful of these type of satellites have been launched into orbit in the past and they have all returned with smashing results they will provide broadband to about three per cent of @entity1 , who will have a small dish or antenna on the roof of their home of office			1
' most of the satellites now are for broadcast activities so these satellites are specifically purpose built for broadband , ' ms @entity39 said			1
' they 've all been very successful in the past			0
' the satellites are set to cover the whole of @entity1 but nbn is targeting the people who live in remote areas			1
' we ’re expecting to get 100 times faster speed than what people in regional areas are currently experiencing , ' she said			2
the satellites are set to cover the whole of @entity1 but nbn are targeting the population who live in remote areas ' we ’ll ensure these people get access where they have n’t before			1
' the rockets took six months to build but the massive satellites , which are some of the largest communication satellites ever built , took over three years to complete			2
ms @entity39 said the three year process is a lengthy one , which takes a lot of planning and designing			0
' they 've completed build and they 've almost finished their testing and then we have to wait for a launch vehicle availability , ' she said			0
' the satellite testing has been really good the we 're very happy with the results			0
' the team will monitor the whole process from the ground stations located at @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 the satellites go through a rigorous testing process			0
they are shaken , vibrated , put in a vacuum , heated and cooled in a simulated environment to see how they will cope in space			0
' it survived that really well and the second satellite is testing just as well , ' ms @entity39 said			0
these satellites will be the first launched in the five - year history of @entity9			1
the company will monitor the satellites from ground stations at @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			0
' those of us who work in the satellite area have launched satellites before and been involved in satellite builds before , ' ms @entity39 said			2
' it ’s obviously very exciting and this project is really interesting because the satellites are specifically built for this and because we know it ’s going to make such a difference to people ’s lives			0
' the next step for @entity9 is to wait for a launch date , which ms @entity39 says is very hard to predict due to a number of factors			2
however , she confirmed that the first satellite is ready to go and it will happen in 2015 @entity40 launched the ' @entity162 ' competition to give @entity1 school kids aged 5 - 12 the opportunity to decorate the nose cone of the rocket which will launch the first satellite into space			1
in addition , the grand prize winner and their school will have the opportunity to name the satellite , etching their place in history			0
details area available at nbnco.com.au / stars			0

the satellites are the size of a small bus , with panels big as a cricket pitch
it is the first time rockets will shot into space for this purpose
the first rocket will be launched in the next few months
it comes after @entity1 ranked 44th on a global chart of internet speed
@entity9 says 400,000 @entity1 will get faster broadband connections
