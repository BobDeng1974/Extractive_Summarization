other shots from the propaganda release show the children performing fitness tests and military drills designed to train them for the harsh realities of the frontline			0
in much the same way as the @entity205 preyed on its impressionable young citizens with the creation of the @entity208 , @entity10 has long groomed children to take part in jihad			1
the practice was the subject of the second episode of @entity216 's groundbreaking ' @entity37 ' documentary series , in which very young boys were seen being asked whether they want to be a suicide bomber or a jihadist , and were forced to repeat calls for the murder of @entity224 ' infidels '			0

the group is said to be controlled from within @entity288 , but the majority of its brigades operate in @entity16			2
it even has a significant presence in the largely regime controlled areas of southern @entity15 , making it one of the most widely widely distributed militant groups engaged in the current conflict			0
the group emerged in the mid- 2000s following a split with the @entity300 , which at the time dominated the @entity34 insurgency in @entity16			2
