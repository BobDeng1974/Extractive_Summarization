by @entity0 last updated at 2:07 pm on 4th january 2012 the @entity1 has raised concern that some test results are deliberately hidden missing data from clinical trials could endanger patients , health experts have warned			1
the @entity1 has raised concern that some test results go unreported and are deliberately hidden , enabling pharmaceutical firms to make unfounded claims			1
commenting on the findings , dr @entity12 from @entity13 and the journal 's dr @entity14 stated that more effective regulation is needed to prevent this trend			2
they called for an end to the ' culture of haphazard publication and incomplete data disclosure '			1
the medical publication released several papers looking into the problem of unpublished data , and highlighted that missing data ' distorts the scientific record ' and undermines the ' whole endeavour of clinical medicine '			2
dr @entity12 and dr @entity14 continued : ' clinical medicine involves making decisions under uncertainty			0
' clinical research aims to reduce this uncertainty , usually by performing experiments on groups of people who consent to run the risks of such trials in the belief that the resulting knowledge will benefit others			0
' most clinicians assume that the complex regulatory systems that govern human research ensure that this knowledge is relevant , reliable and properly disseminated			0
' it generally comes as a shock to clinicians , and certainly to the public , to learn that this is far from the case			0
' one @entity59 study from @entity60 found that fewer than half of the 635 @entity62 funded trials were published in a peer - reviewed , medical journal within 30 months of trial completion			0
lead researcher @entity65 said : ' physicians and policy - makers generally depend on peer - reviewed publications to learn about clinical trial findings			0
' however , extensive research has shown that the results of studies are often not shared publicly in a timely way			2
' more robust regulation and full access to the raw data , is now being called for to ensure greater transparency			2
@entity1 authors stated that those who deliberately hide findings ' have breached their ethical duty to trial participants '			1
the pair concluded : ' these changes have long been called for , and delay has already caused harm			1
' the evidence we publish shows that the current situation is a disservice to research participants , patients , health systems , and the whole endeavour of clinical medicine			0
' the @entity1 has previously attacked the drug industry for being slow to publish data from trials of drugs in development , and also from trials of medicines already licensed and on the market .			1

test results are deliberately hidden
' these changes have long been called for , and delay has already caused harm ' , say @entity1 authors
