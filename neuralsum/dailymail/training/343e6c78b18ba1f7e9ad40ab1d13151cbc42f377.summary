by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:57 am on 21st july 2011 shock : private detective @entity3 had his legal fees paid by @entity5 even after he was jailed for phone hacking			1
this was finally stopped today @entity5 bowed to pressure yesterday and announced it would cease paying the legal fees of the private investigator jailed over phone hacking			1
@entity3 , who was paid more than £ 100,000 a year under contract to the @entity12 , was found guilty of hacking into the phones of several people and sentenced to six months in prison in 2007			2
the move follows evidence given by @entity18 to the @entity19 , when he told mps he was ‘ surprised ’ that ‘ certain legal fees were paid to mr @entity3 ’			1
during a three - hour grilling by a parliamentary select committee yesterday , he also indicated that money has also been paid to disgraced former @entity12 royal editor @entity25			1
but less than 24 hours later , the publisher of the now defunct tabloid , bosses said they had stopped paying @entity3 's fees with ' immediate effect '			1
it did not mention @entity25			2
it came after @entity33 vowed to end the payments provided it was not ' in breach of a legal contract '			1
the admission was the most dramatic revelation during three hours of testimony by mr @entity18 and his father @entity41			0
it immediately stoked the suspicion that the company has sought to buy the silence of the men at the heart of the scandal			0
mr @entity18 junior spent the hearing trying to rescue both his company and his father from tough questioning , smoothly responding to mps ’ inquiries with a combination of denial and management speak			0
@entity25 and @entity3 were both jailed in 2007 for intercepting the voicemails of members of the royal household			1
but @entity18 stunned mps when he said explicitly : ‘ certain legal fees were paid for mr @entity3 by the company and i was surprised and shocked to learn that as you are			1
’ ' humble ' moment : @entity18 , left , and his father @entity33 appear before the @entity68 and @entity69			2
behind them is @entity41 's wife @entity71 , wearing a pink jacket animated : @entity33 at first gesticulated wildly as he defended himself			1
he later became more subdued but after being asked about mr @entity25 hiring an expensive lawyer , he referred to payments going to ‘ those ’ men in the plural , indicating that he meant mr @entity25 as well			0
he said the money was handed over ‘ in accordance with legal counsel and strong advice ’ but both he and his father said they were trying to put a stop to the payments			0
former news international chief executive @entity87 later confirmed that it had paid the legal fees of former @entity12 editor @entity91 even after he left the company and added : ‘ i think the same for @entity25			1
on @entity3 , i think his legal fees would be paid when he was a co-defendant in the civil cases			2
’ @entity96 mp @entity95 said : ‘ people might ask why a company would wish to pay the legal fees of a convicted felon , who ’s been intimately involved in the destruction of your reputation , if it were not to buy his co-operation and silence			0
’ hit : @entity108 ( left ) tries to attack @entity33 ( bottom right ) with a white substance during the hearing strike back : mr @entity18 's wife @entity71 ( left ) stands up and fights back against @entity114 while @entity33 was blunt but frank , his son continually denied knowledge of phone hacking and illegal practices at the @entity12 until the end of last year			2
his strategy appeared to be to blame @entity5 ’s failure to act to stamp out widespread phone hacking on the law firm @entity123 and @entity124			2
questions : former @entity12 royal editor @entity25 may also have had his legal fees paid they were hired to examine internal emails four years ago , but according to mr @entity18 concluded there was no evidence that people other than @entity25 and @entity3 were to blame			1
but last night @entity133 and @entity124 cast doubt on that by asking to be released from the rules of client confidentiality in order to ‘ respond to any inaccurate statements or contentions ’			0
the firm said : ‘ @entity5 declined that request , and so we are still unable to respond in any detail as to our advice or the scope of our instructions in 2007 , which is a matter of great regret			2
’ @entity18 was also asked why the company paid around £ 1.7million to two victims of phone hacking , before the recent scandal broke , but only £ 20,000 to tv presenter @entity152 in recent weeks			0
he denied @entity5 had paid ‘ hush money ’ to @entity154 boss @entity153 and pr man @entity155			0
he said those sums were recommended by the company ’s lawyers			0
but @entity161 @entity160 said : ‘ to most people looking at that it smells a bit			0
’ @entity87 also sought to deflect attention from the storm swirling around her			0
she blamed chancellor @entity167 for telling @entity168 to hire @entity91 , who was editor of the @entity12 when @entity25 and @entity3 were jailed			1
mrs @entity87 , who resigned as chief executive of @entity5 last week , denied ever authorising the paying of a policeman – despite having said in 2003 the practice had happened			1
under fire : @entity87 faces questions during the @entity175 hearing yesterday - just days after she stepped down from her job at @entity5 angry : protesters gather outside @entity178 as the @entity179 give evidence to mps mocking : a protester wearing a @entity33 mask stands outside @entity184 police moved last night to quell conspiracy theories surrounding the death of @entity189 reporter @entity188 , 47 , who claimed phone hacking was ‘ endemic ’ at the paper			1
he was found dead at his flat on monday			0
a post-mortem examination was unable to determine the cause of death , but police said there was no evidence of any foul play .			0

@entity5 stops paying @entity3 's fees with ' immediate effect '
*decision* comes 24 hours after @entity33 vowed to stop practice
but firm may still be *funnelling* cash to @entity210 royal editor @entity25
