the move represent the start of @entity17 's attempt to renegotiate @entity8 's relationship with @entity19 ahead of the proposed in - out referendum on the @entity6			1
but it is also a coup for home secretary @entity2 , who will announce the plans this week and is likely to receive a boost to her profile after successfully deporting hate preacher @entity28			2
there are currently 133 @entity6 regulations governing home affairs , justice and the police , including measures to set up a @entity19 dna database and impose driving bans which are valid across the continent			1
in the next few days , mrs may will tell mps that the @entity8 is to withdraw from all of the regulations before opting back in to some of them , according to the @entity43			1
the process of opting out is governed by the controversial @entity45 , which states that member nations can exempt themselves from whole areas of @entity6 policy			0
the @entity8 government is set to examine each measure in turn to determine whether or not it is in the national interest to sign up			2
it is expected that roughly two thirds of the 133 rules will be ditched by ministers next year			1
one of the most contentious @entity6 justice measures is the @entity13 , which allows any country to demand the arrest and deportation of a suspected criminal by another member state			1
