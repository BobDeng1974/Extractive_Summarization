by @entity0 for the @entity1 you do n't want to mess with @entity4			2
@entity12 up with her son 's failure to pick up the phone when she calls and his ability to never answer her texts , the discerning @entity6 mom decided , with the ways of modern technology , surely she could do something about it			1
' i literally just started researching how to develop an app , ' @entity4 told @entity19			1
once she started , @entity20 did n't stop , and after a few months of designing the application and then meeting with a developer , the result was ignore no more			0
@entity36 requires a password to reactive the phone , which only his mom has			2
he can not call or text anyone but his mom when ignore no more is activated			0
the phone will let him dial 911 , but it wo n't let his access internet or games			1
' @entity36 needs to call me because i 'm the person that has the unlock password , ' @entity4 said			1
her husband @entity50 said he is not surprised at the capabilities of his wife , who served in the @entity33			0
' pretty much anything she sets her mind to she does , ' he said			0
@entity4 said the app had made an immediate difference in being able to contact her son			2
clever : the app gives parents the power to shut down their children 's phones , alloweing them to only call their mom or dad or 911 deactivated : this is the screen the child will see when their phone is shut down via ignore no more not happy : @entity71 said that while he thinks his mom came up with a great idea , he wish she did n't have such control over his phone to ensure his phone is not shut off , @entity36 has been responding to every text and answering his mother 's girls			1
' i thought it was a good idea , but for other people , not me , ' @entity36 told @entity19			0
ignore @entity30 is available only for @entity83 phones via @entity84 .			0

@entity4 , of @entity6 , @entity86 , decided to create an app that would force her son @entity36 to answer her calls and texts
she started researching and met with a developer
together they produced @entity95 , available now for *$* 1.99
it allows parents to deactivate their child 's phone completely until they call back
a deactivated phone can still dial 911
