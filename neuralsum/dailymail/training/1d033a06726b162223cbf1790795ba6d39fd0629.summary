by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:38 est , 9 march 2014 updated : 06:53 est , 10 march 2014 the troubled @entity3 sparked outrage yesterday over plans to give senior staff ‘ obscene ’ pay deals despite the near collapse of its bank			1
new chief executive @entity11 is in line to get £ 3.66million – despite the fact that only last month he admitted that 2013 was ‘ perhaps the worst year ’ in the mutual ’s 150 - year history			1
@entity16 , the co-op ’s chief operating officer , will receive £ 1.8million in total			1
and a dozen senior executives will enjoy huge pay rises despite plans to cut 5,000 jobs and the biggest losses ever recorded by the group			1
pay deal : the co-op is recommending that chief executive @entity11 , who joined in may 2013 and heads the group 's entire operation - from banking to supermarkets , should get a package worth a total of £ 3.66million the co-op is still reeling from the discovery of a £ 1.5billion black hole at its bank and a sex and drugs scandal involving former bank chairman and @entity42 minister , reverend @entity43			1
later this month it is expected to reveal that it made a £ 2billion loss last year , and the group is reportedly interested in selling off its farms and 750 pharmacies to make savings , which could mean between 4,000 and 5,000 staff are laid off			1
the revelations are embarrassing for the @entity53 , which has close links with the co-operative movement			0
the @entity56 has provided financial support to @entity53 for years and 32 @entity58 – including shadow chancellor @entity59 – are also members of the @entity60			1
yesterday , shadow treasury minister @entity61 , one of the mps sponsored by the co-op , said : ‘ i think the co-op should be acting differently			0
accused : the bank 's former chairman , the reverend @entity43 was accused of buying class a drugs , including crystal meth , cocaine and ketamine - a horse tranquilliser also popular as a party drug			1
' they recently put out a questionnaire to the public about their objectives and i did n’t see in it anything about , “ do you agree with extending high remuneration for senior executives ”			0
so i have to say it is a bit disappointing			0
’ @entity86 , head of research at the @entity88 , said : ‘ this flies in the face of everything the co-op stands for			0
’ @entity93 , chief executive of @entity94 , a corporate governance consultancy , said : ‘ the membership is going to be shocked and feel let down			0
’ co-op chairman @entity97 defended the plans			2
‘ the remuneration packages of our executives are in the middle of a range of comparable companies , ’ she said			0
‘ this represents an increase on the pay of their predecessors to reflect the greater commercial , management and turnaround experience they are bringing to bear			0
’ comparison : the packages were put together after comparison with @entity118 and @entity119 companies of a similar size to the co-op group , which includes its supermarkets and bank questions about the management of the bank , which came close to collapse and had to be rescued , were raised following drug revelations surrounding mr @entity43 , including why he had been given such an important role despite his lack of banking knowledge			1
last month mr @entity11 said 2013 had been the worst year in the group 's 150 - year history , and warned that the forthcoming annual financial results would be ' difficult ' , and ' very ugly '			1
according to @entity138 , internal documents prepared for the co-op 's remuneration and appointments committee and marked ' private and confidential ' , suggested that mr @entity11 would be paid a base salery of £ 1.5million , a £ 1.5million retention payment and pension contributions and other expenses			1
last year his predecessor , @entity143 , was paid just over £ 1.3million			0
the documents suggests that the financial package for mr @entity11 , and other members of the executive team were needed because ' the [ co-op 's ] executive agenda is possibly the most complex one facing a large business in the country today '			1
high pay : previous chief executive @entity143 ( pictured ) was paid just over £ 1.3million , far less than is planned for his predecessor chief operating officer @entity16 with receive a £ 900,000 salary and a matching retention payment , and six other executives will receive salaries and retention sums of between £ 500,000 and £ 650,000 - compared to previous figures of between £ 200,000 and £ 400,000			1
the packages were put together after comparison with @entity118 and @entity119 companies of a similar size to the co-op , which is owned by its eight million members			0
@entity97 , chair of @entity3 , told @entity165 : ' last year @entity3 faced the biggest crisis in its 150 - year history with the need to recapitalise its @entity56			1
' we saved the @entity56 , without recourse to the taxpayer and we are now embarking on the long and complex journey to revitalise the wider group			1
the @entity3 's £ 2billion losses expected to be announced on march 26 , are believed to stem mainly from its banking division , as well as a reduction in the value of its supermarkets			1
the bank had to be rescued at the end of last year , with @entity183 hedge funds and other investors emerging with control over the division			0
it had merged with the @entity188 in august 2009 and two years the bank announced a deal to take over 632 branches of @entity192			2
however , losses were building , partly down to commercial property and the @entity188 's soured corporate loans , as well as a failed it project			2
the bank revealed an annual loss of £ 674million in march 2013 and abandoned the @entity200 deal			1
last may the bank 's debt rating was downgraded by ratings agency @entity203 and it was revealed that more than 10per cent of its commercial loans were ' impaired '			1
the bank 's chief executive @entity208 stepped down and in june the bank revealed there was a £ 1.5billion black hole			1
' that means reducing debt , improving performance and streamlining a business that had become grossly inefficient			0
it is against that backdrop that we recruited @entity11 and a top team with the skills and experience needed at this crucial stage in our history , reflecting the necessity for change			2
' the remuneration packages of our executives are in the middle of a range of comparable companies			0
' this represents an increase on the pay of their predecessors to reflect the greater commercial , management and turnaround experience they are bringing to bear			0
' @entity11 and his team have already made a significant contribution to @entity3 and we are confident that they will continue to do so			2
' although the bank 's rescue was achieved without the need for help from the taxpayer , 70 per cent of it is now controlled by a group of @entity183 hedge funds and the restructuring left many customers with fears over its future direction			1
many customers chose to use the bank because of its ethical policy , which reflects their own concerns regarding issues such as animal welfare , the arms trade , genetic modification and human rights , as well as the fact that the group is owned and run by its members - who all have an equal say and share in the profits			2
the co-operative group has previously said it is committed to preserving the bank 's ethical focus , despite the presence of the hedge funds			1
@entity279 , the former @entity280 spokesman and a @entity56 customer said that managers at the group should only be ' well rewarded ' after turning the business around			1
' gigantic golden hellos for the new bosses send the wrong message to millions of loyal members , customers and staff , ' he said			0
last week @entity291 and state - backed @entity200 came under fire for rewarding senior executives in the wake of mis - selling scandals and plunging profits			0
both banks were criticised for pushing through rewards that jar with attempts to curb financial largesse , and mps have previously condemned the ‘ gut - churning ’ scale of bonuses as bankers brought the economy to the brink of meltdown			0
@entity291 ’ annual report showed chief executive @entity310 could be paid up to a maximum of £ 7.2million this year , while @entity200 expects to pay boss @entity312 a maxium package of £ 7.8million in 2014			2
while @entity310 ’ package is £ 1.4million lower than the maximum pay he was entitled to last year , more of his reward is guaranteed			2
@entity291 recently posted a 32 per cent fall in profit and caused controversy by increasing bonuses by 10 per cent			0
@entity310 claimed the pay decision was vital to avoid the bank plunging into a ‘ death spiral , ’ as staff leave			2
@entity291 ’ annual report also showed 481 staff were paid £ 1million or more last year with eight receiving more than £ 5million			2
the lender tried to play this down by pointing out that 57 per cent of those paid at least £ 1million were based in @entity183 , with only 27 per cent in the @entity330			0
@entity200 is seeking approval from shareholders to be able to pay key staff bonuses worth 200 per cent of their fixed pay , following on the heels of @entity291 and @entity337			2
@entity338 , chairman of the @entity339 , said last week : ‘ it is regrettable that a number of banks appear not to have accepted the need for fundamental reform in this year ’s bonus round			0
‘ the new consensus emerging on pay remains seriously flawed			0
it will now be up to regulators to do the job			0
