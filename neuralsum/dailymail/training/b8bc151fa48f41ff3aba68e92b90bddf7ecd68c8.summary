when @entity1 did his daily stalk of himself , he discovered an upsetting error - he was too short			1
searching the internet for his own height , the political satirist found that @entity7 listed him as being 5ft 10ins , one inch shorter than he is in real life			2
the 50 - year - old host used his own talk show as platform to jokily threaten @entity7 and it 's ceo @entity13 with severe reprisals if his height - issue was not addressed			1
addressing mr @entity13 directly , @entity1 demanded ' a retraction , an investigation , an apology and a substantial cash settlement			2
' he joked that he wanted the 5 ' 11 glory he shares with @entity27 and @entity28 , rather than share ' the stale air ' of the ( 5ft10in ) @entity30			0
' all i want is the height i deserve			0
and i fought for every inch , and no one , but no one , is taking that away from me			0
especially not @entity13 , who according to @entity7 , is 5 ' 11 '			0
' jibe : @entity1 made a joked about making a ' physical threat ' to @entity7 ceo @entity13 ' fix it , or i will fix you , @entity13			1
and yes , that is a physical threat			0
' knowing that a man like @entity1 is not a wrath one wishes to invoke , @entity7 quickly took action on the matter - in the best way possible			2
now if you google ' how tall is @entity1 ? ' , it results in ' 5ft 10.5ins ( 1.79m - ish ) '			1
@entity1 's height is also compared to other talkshow hosts - @entity13 ( 5ft 11ins ) and @entity50 ( 6ft 4ins )			1
however , in another jibe from @entity7 , not - exactly - @entity53 - material @entity52 is simply referred to as ' @entity54 ' .			0

@entity1 discovered he was one inch too short on @entity7
satirist jokily threatened @entity7 's ceo @entity13 if it was not *changed*
@entity7 *responded* by *changing* @entity1 's height to ' @entity60 ( 1.79m - ish ) '
