@entity0 hauled themselves off the foot of the championship - and reminded the division that they will continue to battle through adversity - as they recorded a first win of the season on a highly - charged evening			1
hundreds of @entity0 supporters opted to show their disdain at the way in which the club was run , with fans flocking towards the @entity14 concourses beyond the 53rd minute and staging a walkout in protest at the @entity19 family ’s regime			1
a plan devised to unnerve their unpopular owners actually served to stir the xi battling for the cause			0
eleven minutes after the chanting for chairman @entity19 and his father @entity27 to vacate the club , @entity0 's @entity25 waltzed his way into the @entity31 box to score			1
@entity25 ( centre right ) scored the only goal of the game for @entity0 in their 1 - 0 win against @entity31 @entity0 team - mates congratulate @entity37 ( centre ) on his 64th minute striker at @entity14 @entity0 captain @entity40 shows his delight at @entity25 's strike for the @entity44 club @entity0 : @entity45 , @entity40 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 13 ) ; @entity50 , @entity51 ; @entity52 ( @entity53 90 +2 ) , @entity25 ( @entity54 83 ) , @entity55 ; @entity56 subs not used : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 booked : @entity40 , @entity54 goal : @entity37 64 @entity31 : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 ; @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 ( @entity71 69 ) , @entity72 ( @entity73 69 ) , @entity74 ; @entity75 ( @entity76 61 ) subs not used : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 booked : @entity67 , @entity68 it was fitting that as @entity37 twirled away to celebrate his first goal for the club , a banner reading ‘ # footballfirst ’ - the supporters ’ trust ’s mantra endorsed by club president @entity91 - was being flourished wildly in a sparsely populated @entity93 stand			1
on the day that @entity27 insisted the ruling family were n’t thieving from a club to have seen next to no financial strengthening after their @entity98 windfall , @entity0 showed they are not robbing a place in the second tier			1
they possessed heart and a willingness to fight for their manager , @entity103 , and were the better side against @entity31 , who have been in disarray themselves but not to anywhere near the same level			1
as home fans left their seats to make a way down towards the pitch screaming ‘ you greedy b * * * * * * - get out of our club , ’ @entity27 , 80 , cut a frail figure in the directors ’ box			1
there was more than just a point these hardy souls wanted to get across - they are trying to effect change			2
@entity0 fans protested against chairman @entity19 ahead of the match against @entity31 on friday some fans left @entity14 midway through a first half in which both sides failed to break the deadlock home fans also flashed the lights on the back of their mobile phones in another stance against the @entity136 's the hosts felt they should have a penalty in the first half when @entity67 ( left ) tackled @entity55 ( right ) @entity0 striker @entity56 ( right ) was a menace to the @entity31 defence throughout the match whether they will or not remains to be seen , but the smoke bombs , black balloons and consistent songs made sure those who were n’t already aware of their predicament certainly are now			1
the @entity149 were the more dangerous throughout the match			2
@entity56 - a thorn in the away side all night - could n’t connect with a @entity40 centre as the hosts appeared buoyed by the loud and consistent chants for regime change			1
@entity55 felt he ought to have been awarded a penalty just before the half - hour mark , when former @entity159 left back @entity67 appeared to sweep his legs from underneath			2
when you ’re rooted to the bottom , these finer decisions tend to go the other way			2
@entity167 - whose twin @entity165 was forced off injured earlier in the piece - somehow stepped over the ball six yards out when all he had to do was hammer home			2
@entity31 striker @entity75 ( left ) blazed over a great opporunity to give @entity31 the lead in the first half @entity31 did have their chances too			1
@entity176 might have opened the scoring but headed wide ; @entity75 then skied over the bar from seven yards out , so too @entity69 just outside the box			0
@entity0 equipped themselves well and a significant hat tip must go to the beleaguered @entity181 for that			1
the @entity183 inherited a squad that lost no fewer than 27 players before pre-season and then found communication with chairman @entity19 completely break down over the club 's infamous transfer policy			1
@entity103 had just eight senior professionals with under a fortnight to go until the opening game of the season			0
to have six points and be off the bottom at this stage is a minor miracle			0
@entity198 , who began his career on the @entity200 , told the situation best			0
‘ it ’s unacceptable at this level			0
for me @entity181 has done a very good job			0
he ’s got them playing and is starting to turn the tide			0
’ @entity0 fans staged a mass walkout in the 53rd minute of their team 's match against @entity31 two fans hold up a sign which reads ' thieves ' as they make their way out of @entity14 @entity216 ( left ) was unmoved as @entity0 staged their latest protest against the club 's ownership @entity67 was cleverly played in by @entity220 but his shot was deflected wide , with @entity64 ’s effort from the resulting corner well blocked before the only goal			1
then @entity25 picked up the ball just outside the box with 64 minutes on the clock			2
the former @entity229 man drove at the backpedalling @entity65 before firing beneath @entity63			0
those who had congregated at the bottom of the @entity233 stand could n’t believe what they were seeing			0
@entity236 missed a great chance to equalise for the visitors late on at @entity14 their hastily - assembled back four - alongside goalkeeper @entity240 making his debut at this level - needed to remain firm			1
@entity76 and @entity74 both had chances , before @entity55 somehow smashed straight at @entity63 from four yards			0
that miss could have been costly , but it was the @entity247 team ’s night after @entity240 made a super stop to deny substitute @entity236 and the striker then fired over unmarked			0
to put this result into perspective , it is @entity0 ’s first win in 160 days			2
@entity103 will hope for more , and quickly			0
perhaps the @entity254 are wondering what might have been had they put hands in pockets over the summer .			0

@entity0 beat @entity31 1 - 0 to move off the bottom of the championship
@entity25 's strike gave the hosts *victory* at @entity14
@entity0 fans staged several protests against the club 's ownership throughout the match
