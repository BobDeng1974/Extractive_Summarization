by @entity0 and @entity1 a mother - to - be died after trainee surgeons took out an ovary instead of her appendix in a weekend operation			1
@entity7 was five months pregnant when she was admitted to hospital with serious abdominal pain			1
doctors correctly diagnosed appendicitis only to remove the wrong organ on the operating table			2
they discharged their 32 - year - old patient from hospital but – two weeks after the initial operation – readmitted her because she was still in great pain			2
@entity7 , 32 , pregnant with the the baby she miscarried days before she died of multiple organ failure			1
she was suffering from appendicitis but unsupervised trainee surgeons removed one of her ovaries by mistake by now , a pathology report revealing the failure to remove her dangerously inflamed appendix had been available for a week			1
yet , incredibly , doctors had not read it			0
they only looked at the report , and realised their mistake , two days later – when mrs @entity7 had a miscarriage			1
by now she was suffering sepsis , a severe blood infection caused by the untreated appendicitis			0
she had an emergency operation to remove septic fluid but died 48 hours later on the operating table when surgeons finally removed her appendix			1
she had suffered major organ failure			1
yesterday her husband @entity43 said a ‘ litany of errors ’ had been made during his wife ’s treatment and he planned to take legal action against @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49			1
‘ my wife ’s death could have been prevented , i am sure of it , ’ said the 53 - year - old			0
‘ by the time they realised how serious the situation was – and they promised us all the best consultants – it was too late			0
‘ this is neglect , this is an unlawful killing			0
if my wife had been given treatment by fully qualified staff and people were informed of the mistake earlier she could still be alive			0
‘ she went to hospital with stomach pains and we were told she needed to have her appendix out			2
‘ she had the operation , and left hospital eight days later , but the pain continued			2
we would n’t have ever imagined what they had done			0
’ mrs @entity7 ' condition failed to improve after the mistake was noticed and she died on the operating table at @entity47 , @entity48 ( pictured ) after medics finally removed her appendix - 19 days after the wrong procedure			1
she had developed severe sepsis as a result of the appendicitis at an inquest last week , coroner @entity88 spoke of a ‘ lost window of opportunity ’ that could have saved mrs @entity7 ’s life			1
the hearing in @entity94 , @entity95 , was told the operation was carried out on sunday , october 23 , 2011 , by two trainee surgeons without the supervision of a consultant			2
eight days later tests showed they had bungled but it was not until november 9 – and when mrs @entity7 had been back in their care for two more days – that doctors read the report and realised the appendix had not been dealt with			1
dr @entity107 told the hearing she examined the pathology results because she was ‘ puzzled ’ that mrs @entity7 was still in pain			1
‘ it did n’t make sense that a healthy young woman with appendicitis was n’t recovering after the appendix had been removed , ’ she said			2
‘ i looked at the results and it showed that her ovary had been removed and not her appendix			2
i could not believe it , i was shocked			0
’ @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 has admitted liability for mrs @entity7 ’s death on november 11 , 2011			1
chief executive @entity126 said : ‘ the trust fully accepts the inquest verdict			0
i would once again like to apologise unreservedly to mrs @entity7 ’s family for their loss			1
‘ we have admitted liability in this case			0
the staff involved in mrs @entity7 ’s care have been deeply affected by her death			1
‘ an extensive trust - wide action plan was drawn up following mrs @entity7 ’s death in 2011 to ensure that such a tragic incident will not happen again			1
‘ we have kept mrs @entity7 ’s family fully informed about the investigation into her death and the subsequent wide - ranging work which has taken place to improve systems and patient safety			1
’ liability : mrs de @entity7 's husband said ' my wife could still be alive ' the @entity150 is investigating eight hospital staff , including senior surgical consultant dr @entity152 over the case			2
mrs @entity7 , a teaching assistant from @entity154 , @entity49 , would have been 34 this month			1
her daughter @entity155 , ten , said : ‘ we have put the balloons up because it was mum ’s birthday and it ’s good to celebrate it			0
’ her son @entity162 , 16 , said : ‘ it feels like such a big injustice			0
’ the coroner recorded a narrative verdict			0
shocking findings published last month revealed that patients who have planned operations at the weekend rather than a monday are 82 per cent more likely to die			0
researchers from @entity171 looked at four million elective operations in @entity174 hospitals in @entity175 between 2008 and 2011 with at least one night spent in hospital			0
elective surgery normally involves procedures such as heart bypass , hip and knee replacements , gastric operations and hysterectomies			0
altogether 27,500 patients died within 30 days of surgery , with the risk lowest for those having it on monday and rising on each subsequent day of the week			2
the extra risk on tuesday was minimal , but went up to 15 per cent on wednesday , 21 per cent for thursday patients and 44 per cent on friday – all compared with monday			0
almost one in 20 operations was performed at a weekend , when the increased risk reached 82 per cent , said the study published online at bmj.com			0
further pressure on hospitals at weekends has come from patients flooding casualty units because of the problems accessing out - of - hours gp care .			0

@entity202 was admitted for surgery at @entity47 in @entity48
because she was *heavily* pregnant , surgeons had to ' feel ' for the appendix
she died 19 days after first botched operation from multiple organ failure
' a lost window of opportunity could have saved her , ' said coroner
mrs @entity7 ' family said she was ' unlawfully killed by a ' litany of errors '
