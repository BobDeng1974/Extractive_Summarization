’ the @entity49 campaign , which had been angered by an @entity1 campaign ad featuring @entity77 and questioning whether @entity49 would have given the order to kill @entity5 , was cautious about taking @entity1 to task for the @entity6 trip because of the tradition of refraining from political attacks when a president is abroad			1
