as officials gave the final go - ahead to thursday 's @entity4 launch of the capsule that could take man to @entity7 , @entity0 unveiled another important part of the mission - its countdown clock ,			1
last week , down came the countdown clock that dated back to the @entity13 moon shot in 1969 and signalled every space shuttle launch for 30 years			1
today , the new clock , in the same exact spot at the @entity17 press site that , along with the nearby flag pole , had once earned national historic designation , was switched on for the first time			2
the new clock , in the same exact spot at the @entity17 press site that , along with the nearby flag pole , had once earned national historic designation , was switched on for the first time			2
the new clock is just as long at 26 feet , but a foot taller at 7 feet			1
the new clock is just as long at 26 feet , but a foot taller at 7 feet			1
can show video as well as numbers the new clock is just as long at 26 feet , but a foot taller at 7 feet			1
it 's the nation 's first new spacecraft intended for true outer - space travel by humans since the @entity31			1
what better way to usher in this new era of exploration , @entity0 reasoned , than with the latest flat - screen gizmo			2
so last week , down came the countdown clock that dated back to the @entity13 moon shot in 1969 and signaled every space shuttle launch for 30 years			1
and up went the new display in the same exact spot at the @entity17 press site that , along with the nearby flag pole , had once earned national historic designation			0
the new clock is just as long at 26 feet , but a foot taller at 7 feet			1
@entity0 spokesman @entity45 said the old clock , while still working , had become too expensive to fix and maintain			0
parts were hard to come by			0
( it used 349 light bulbs to illuminate the hours , minutes and seconds , the colons and the plus and minus signs			0
) ' it was just becoming an antique , ' @entity45 said			0
the new $ 280,000 display , similar to those used at sports stadiums , can provide multiple images in addition to the countdown time			0
' an electronic billboard , ' explained @entity62 , a @entity0 ground systems manager			0
the old clock used used 349 light bulbs to illuminate the hours , minutes and seconds , the colons and the plus and minus signs dismantled : workmen haul the clock into a truck after the plug was pulled on the world 's second most watched clock after @entity72 the @entity4 capsule , on top of the rockets that will launch it on thursday on tuesday , the countdown numbers ticked down in the lower right corner - far smaller than on the old familiar clock			1
but that 's because the left half of the display showed a real - time , close - up image of the @entity85 rocket launch pad			1
in the upper right corner , the words ' @entity86 ' showed in red , sandwiched between an @entity4 emblem and the @entity0 logo			2
@entity0 took pains to keep the scene basically the same , with the clock and flag pole , according to @entity45			0
even so , more than a few space - age veterans were sorry to see the old , familiar clock hauled off			2
@entity45 tried to be philosophical about the switch : ' we wo n't have to worry about changing the light bulbs anymore			0
' @entity101 17 's launch on dec. 7 , 1972 , marked mankind 's last trip to the moon - and the last crewed capsule to leave @entity107 's immediate vicinity			1
during its december 4 test flight , the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles ( 5,790km ) into space			1
it will then take two big laps around @entity107 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph ( 32,200 km / h ) and parachuting into the @entity114 off the @entity116 coast			0
the launch @entity117 and upper stage , shown in the left of this image , have been transported to @entity121			0
here , they will be joined with the @entity122 ahead of a test flight in december			1
the right image shows the stages @entity4 will go through during flight during the two - orbit , four - hour mission , engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety , the launch abort system , the heat shield and the parachute system			1
the data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models			0
the flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later @entity4 flights			2
the capsule will re-enter @entity107 's atmosphere generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees @entity144 , before splashing down in the @entity114			0
this inaugural @entity4 - scheduled for a 7:05 a.m. est send - off - will carry no crew during the 4 1/2 - hour test flight and be confined to @entity107 orbit			1
but it will aim for a high point of 3,600 miles on the second loop of the planet , setting the spacecraft up for a 20,000 - mph , 4,000 - degree re-entry			0
splashdown will occur in the @entity114 , 600 miles southwest of @entity116			0
managers from @entity155 ( @entity155 ) and @entity156 gave a ' go ' to proceed toward launch pending completion of open work during the @entity160 for @entity4 's flight test			1
the weather is forecast to be 60 percent ' go ' for a scheduled liftoff at 7:05 a.m. est on thursday , dec. 4			1
with @entity165 in the foreground , @entity164 lifts off at the @entity17 in @entity121 , @entity0 spokesman @entity45 said the old clock , while still working , had become too expensive to fix and maintain			0
for this launch , a @entity85 rocket will do the heavy lifting			0
@entity171 will be launched aboard @entity0 's still - in - development @entity172 , or @entity172 , intended to carry astronauts to asteroids , @entity7 and beyond			2
one plan calls for an asteroid to be corralled in orbit around the moon , so an @entity4 crew can explore the rock sometime in the 2020s			1
@entity7 expeditions would follow in the 2030s			0
@entity0 is counting on the new countdown clock to be around for all that			2
@entity187 , meanwhile , can take heart			0
the space center hopes to reassemble and display the old clock at its tourist stop next year .			2

clock that dated back to @entity13 moon shot in 1969 and signaled every space shuttle launch removed last week
new clock is just as long at 26 feet , but a foot taller at 7 feet - and entire clock is a video screen
shows countdown for thursday 's launch and live video of the launchpad
launch scheduled for 7:05 a.m. est , and @entity4 will carry no crew during the 4 1/2 - hour test flight
