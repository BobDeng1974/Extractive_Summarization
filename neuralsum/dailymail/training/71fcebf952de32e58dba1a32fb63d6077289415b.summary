by @entity0 footage showing a serious case of wave rage has emerged after a surfer from @entity5 seemed to get sick of fighting for space in the surf			1
the 15 second video shot by @entity9 sees @entity10 take out a @entity12 surfer in a massive tackle after he apparently kept cutting him off in the line up to take waves			1
@entity10 enters the frame from the left , travelling across the wave at a great speed			2
riding lower on the wave than his fellow surfer , @entity10 then appears to make a sharp and deliberate cut upwards across the water			1
the @entity31 then smashes into the other surfer , and the collision sends both men and their boards flying			0
@entity31 surfer @entity10 enters the wave before the other surfer and was travelling at a great speed suddenly the @entity12 man drops into the wave ahead of the @entity31 already riding it the two surfers disappear into the foam and @entity10 's board shoots up into the air above the spot where the pair land			1
@entity10 told @entity44 he was simply enjoying time out in the water with his mates when the waves got a little crowded			0
the @entity49 said the ' crowd ' did n't deter him from the water and was happy to just wait his turn and enjoy the rest of the session			0
the @entity49 realises what has happened as he levels with his fellow surfer @entity10 then tackles the other man and the collision sends both men flying ' oh well , it was bound to happen at some point , so you just smile , wait you 're turn and try enjoy the remainder of you 're session ( sic ) , ' he told the website			2
' this would work except the newcomers have a different attitude , continuous snaking , consecutive drop - ins and generally bad attitudes would make you think you have entered into a @entity75 ( @entity74 qualifying series ) final			0
' ' as luck would have it , one particular honing missile decided to head my way to fade me for the third consecutive time , let â€™s just say my exit off the wave was either poorly timed or perfectly executed , depending on how you look at the situation , ' he said			0
the pair disappear into the foam after the rugby - like take down			2
