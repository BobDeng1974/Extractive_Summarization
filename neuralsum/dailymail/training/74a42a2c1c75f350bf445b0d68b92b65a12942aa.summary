by @entity0 published : 04:42 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 16:11 est , 4 march 2014 @entity2 have dragged themselves back in to the @entity4 title race with some rampant displays of late			1
here , @entity6 's @entity0 tells us why we should rally behind @entity9 ' team in their bid to lift the league trophy for the first time since 1990			1
10 – @entity2 are the only title contenders who have yet to win the @entity4 since it began in 1992			1
someone new would be refreshing and welcome			2
@entity15 emerged because of @entity17 ’s millions , same with @entity18 and @entity19			1
if @entity2 emerge as a title - winning force they will have done it with tactics and brilliant football , more than money			1
winning formula : @entity28 deserves to be a title - winning captain , according to @entity0 @entity31 quality : @entity32 and @entity33 are just two of the big - money purchases at @entity18 you too : @entity15 lifted their first trophy of the season after beating @entity38 in the @entity39 9 – @entity2 provide several examples of how the crucial thing in life is not the mistakes we all make , but how we respond to those mistakes			1
@entity9 failed at @entity47 , he was sacked after five wins in 21 games and threatened with relegation			1
but he rebuilt himself as a manager and bounced back			0
then : @entity9 while at @entity47 now : @entity9 during the @entity53 match reborn : @entity54 has been pivotal for @entity2 this season so far derided : @entity54 's £ 20m price tage was questioned when he moved to @entity56 from @entity38 @entity54 is also worth a mention here			1
he received heavy criticism after signing for @entity2			1
the £ 16million price tag did n’t help			0
but he stayed strong , played his football and has come through it as a professional footballer who now commands respect for his conduct on and off the field			0
8 – it would be a massive advertisement for coaching in this country			0
@entity9 is , of course , from @entity72			2
but he learned his trade in the @entity75 game			0
twenty years ago he was combining coaching in the @entity77 with working as assistant groundsman at the training ground ( the head groundsman was @entity81 ! )			0
@entity9 did the legwork , learned his trade , soaked up knowledge and look where he is now			2
that ’s what @entity9 is			2
look at the way @entity2 took control on saturday at @entity53 after half - time			1
a lot of managers have been praised this season for showing tactical prowess but none can top what @entity9 has done			1
he ’s changed formation from game to game and during matches			0
but more impressive than that , he ’s devised a system to allow good players to flourish and enjoy their football			2
tactically @entity9 has shown good results can be achieved by playing open and entertaining football			2
you might think that ’s not so special or unique – other managers play good football and are doing as well as @entity2			1
but @entity9 is the only manager to play an expansive , tactically brave game at the same time as managing the high expectations at a club starting at such a low base			1
had he shown fear , and been more cautious , @entity2 would n’t be so good to watch , and players like @entity118 would n’t want to hang around at the club			1
to go from finishing seventh and 28 points behind the champions , to launching a title challenge at the same time as playing such an open entertaining game is the mark of tactical brilliance			2
111340 26193 98732 too strong : @entity118 ( right ) and @entity2 brushed aside a good @entity53 side last weekend rampant : @entity128 spearheaded the attack in the rout of @entity131 at @entity56 7 – the football @entity2 play is a joy to watch			1
they ’ve hit some of the most spectacular passes of the season so far : @entity28 ’s breathtaking ball through to @entity128 for the @entity139 ’ first goal in the 3 - 2 win at @entity142 ; @entity144 ’s stunning defence splitter for @entity128 ’s opener in the 4 - 3 win against @entity147 recently ; @entity54 ’s back heel for @entity128 ’s goal against @entity150 ; and @entity152 ’s amazing ball through to @entity128 for the fourth when they blitzed @entity131			1
@entity9 ’ @entity2 are all about beautiful passing , fluid movement and great finishing			1
yes there ’s some bad defending but how can a team with a policy of scoring more than the opposition – no matter how many the opposition score – be criticised ? that ’s entertainment			0
licence to thrill : @entity128 celebrates after latching on to a wonderful ball from @entity28 at @entity142 6 – @entity56 will reignite fans ’ passion at the very top of the game if @entity2 win the title			1
some stadiums are quiet and soulless but not @entity56			0
if the @entity4 champions have fans behind them showing true emotion to encourage their team then others will surely follow suit			2
even @entity179 can be a quiet place			0
just look at @entity2 ’s home record since @entity9 took over – the fans have played a major part			1
backed : @entity2 's home record has been sensational this season , in part thanks to the @entity56 crowd passion : @entity2 fans have a restored belief that they could snatch the title from @entity191 , @entity18 or @entity131 5 – they have shown other clubs who are n’t in the @entity195 annually that you do n’t have to sell your best players to the so - called bigger boys			1
@entity118 looked all set to leave last summer but @entity2 and @entity201 dug in their heels and kept their man			2
@entity118 certainly is n’t regretting that decision to stay and sign a new contract now			0
on his way ? @entity118 threatened to leave the club after being derided for a series of unsavoury incidents digging in his heels : @entity201 played a key role in keeping @entity118 at the club 4 – if @entity2 win the title , that will motivate @entity215 even more			1
and if both @entity217 clubs are fighting hard for success then football in this country will be in a very healthy place			0
the bulk of my football education happened in the 1980s when @entity215 and @entity2 took it in turns to be the kings of @entity75 football			1
both played fantastic football , and had fantastic success at home and abroad			0
i ca n’t wait for that rivalry to be resumed at the very top level of the game			2
imagine @entity215 taking on @entity2 home and away in a @entity195 semi-final			1
if you love football you would just salivate at that possibility			0
if @entity2 win the title , the pressure will be on @entity215 and @entity243 to raise their game			1
this country needs both clubs to be successful			0
young talent : @entity215 have been in fine fettle thanks to @entity249 ( left ) and @entity250 ( right ) back in vogue : the @entity2 v @entity215 rivalry is one of the fiercest in football 3 – @entity2 are historically one of @entity257 ’s finest clubs			1
they are known globally , they have a rich history of success in @entity260 that is recognised across the world of football			0
they belong in the elite			0
they should be back competing with the very best in @entity260			0
that ’s where @entity2 belongs			2
anyone who knows their football history would agree			0
five @entity269 – no @entity75 side can match that			0
2 – @entity28 deserves to be a title - winning captain			2
he ’s one of the finest players this country has ever produced : he ’s got character , strength to go with his ability and quality			0
he ’s a winner – he showed that in 2005			0
but he ’s not had enough players around him to secure the @entity4 title he so richly deserves			1
@entity28 has stayed at @entity2 his whole career with the dream of winning the title – he could have gone anywhere but did n’t			1
if you ’ve read his autobiography you ’ll know how he talks time and time again about the ' love affair ' he has with @entity2			1
and the devastation he felt when he thought the club did n’t want him to stay in the aftermath of the triumph in @entity294			0
what a reward it would be for @entity28 ’s loyalty if they finally won the @entity4 title this season			1
captain , leader , legend : @entity28 has been a great servant for @entity2 and deserves a @entity4 trophy national prowess : @entity257 skipper @entity28 is currently with @entity306 's squad 1 – @entity2 have nurtured a core of brilliant young @entity75 players			1
teenager @entity144 looks a certainty to go to the @entity310 in my view			2
why would @entity306 leave such a talent at home ? he ’s playing well , scoring and making goals , he ’s a game - changer , and a potential match - winner			0
a year ago people were suggesting he needed a loan spell in the championship			0
the improvement has been amazing			0
he has to be a serious contender for @entity323			0
another @entity310 certainty in my opinion has to be @entity54			0
@entity9 has trusted him and he has emerged as a gifted midfielder who can pass the ball and has a goal in him			2
@entity128 was a goal machine waiting to explode			0
@entity15 and @entity18 held him back – but at @entity2 he has catapulted himself onto the big stage in a massive way			1
28 goals in 29 @entity4 starts is a world - class statistic			2
take a bow : @entity128 ( right ) and @entity118 are the most prolific strike partnership in the @entity4 call him up ! @entity339 battles with @entity340 during the match against @entity147 @entity339 has seized his chance at full back			2
fans of most clubs love a local lad to come through the ranks and make it in the first team			0
@entity2 have produced legends in recent years			2
@entity339 has brought dynamism to the team , and i am stunned that neither @entity306 nor @entity354 saw fit to pick him for international duty this week			0
it ’s a huge oversight , and when i interviewed him on monday @entity339 admitted he was disappointed			0
@entity2 are on course to contribute @entity128 , @entity54 and @entity144 to the @entity310 cause this summer			1
and the @entity257 captain as well			0
if the title goes to @entity56 it ’s a victory for @entity2			1
but it ’s also a victory for football , and for @entity257 .			0

@entity2 battling @entity15 , @entity131 and @entity18 for @entity4 title
@entity9 ' tactics have been the best in the top *flight* this season
it would be refreshing to see @entity2 finish top for the first time since 1990
they are an advert for fine @entity377 talent with players like @entity144
it would be great to see @entity215 play against @entity2 in @entity195
