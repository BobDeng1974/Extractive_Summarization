this is the shocking moment a baby was allowed to crawl perilously close to the edge of a steep cliff in @entity4 so that her parents could snap a keepsake photograph			1
dressed in a pink outfit and cap , the young child was accompanied by four adults , who were at least a few feet away from her , and would have faced certain death if she had rolled in the wrong direction			0
hiker @entity15 , who snapped the chilling photo on saturday afternoon , said he could n’t believe his eyes when he encountered the scene as he made his way up to @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , a steep cliff that has a 1,982ft drop			1
he and his 11 - year - old daughter were sitting down in a safe spot nearby when the family placed the baby , unaware of the danger that she faced , on the mountain ledge			2
he told @entity38 : ‘ i saw the mother and she was putting the baby down close to the edge and backing up a little bit so the other lady could get a clean photo of the baby and the @entity20 in the background			1
‘ it ’s a straight drop			1
you do n’t want to go too close because it ’s pretty scary			2
you ’d be pretty much dead if you fall down there			1
’ mr @entity15 snapped the photo and considered walking down to say something to the group , but they scooped up the baby and moved on			1
he added : ‘ i was very shocked			0
it was over so quickly , i could hardly react			0
' hiker @entity15 , who snapped the photograph of the family , said he was stunned when the baby was placed so close to the mountain ledge mr @entity15 added : ‘ i think they put the baby into a great risk			1
a baby can easily tip around and it ’s really unpredictable and you never know when that will happen			2
‘ if the baby fell away from the mommy i do n’t know if she could have caught the baby			0
‘ i thought this was such a crazy thing to do that people should know about this			0
’ @entity70 , ceo of the @entity72 , encouraged people to use extreme caution when they hike up to @entity20			2
he told the @entity75 : ‘ i have taken my children to @entity20 and kept them at a safe distance away from the edge			2
' all parents are different , but i would n't look after my children like that			0
’ tourist draw : tens of thousands of people visit @entity20 , known as @entity20 , in @entity86 , @entity4 every year @entity20 towers over a fjord in the municipality of @entity86 and is one of @entity4 ’s most popular attractions , drawing tens of thousands of holidaymakers every year			1
last year , a @entity93 man plunged to his death while taking photos , reigniting the debate over whether a security fence should be installed to protect visitors			0
but @entity99 believes a fence or signs would spoil the experience : ‘ we can not put up signs telling that parents should not put their children down near the edge			0
nor do i think we should put up fences and secure the area			0

a father photographed the shocking scene while he made his way up @entity20 in southern @entity4
@entity15 said the family placed the baby near the edge of the cliff and *stepped* back to snap photos
he said there is a straight drop and ' you ’d be pretty much dead if you fall down there '
