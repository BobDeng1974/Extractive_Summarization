i met @entity1 , the founder of @entity1 , recently when we both visited my old college to talk to the students there			1
i was invited back to @entity7 for their awards presentation and they had @entity11 there because he 's someone who has made a career , made a whole company , from just him and a camera			1
he gave a great speech about where he 's come from and what he 's doing			1
one line stood out for me			1
he related a career to athletics , saying ; ' just focus on your own lane , do n't worry about what anyone else is doing , what any other athletes are doing or anything else that is going on			1
just focus on your own training , your own race , and you 'll get the results you deserve			2
' we hung out a little bit afterwards			2
he 's a really easy guy to chat to – he 's just normal – he 's just a normal guy with a great business idea and he 's gone and developed that and made something huge			2
@entity39 crosses the line ahead of @entity42 's @entity41 during the @entity43 when i played at @entity46 they put us in that college so i stayed there for two years			1
they 've always been very supportive of me			2
i did a q&a about how the summer went and how my career is going			1
i tried to get across that it 's all about patience , people develop at different rates , no matter what you 're doing keep concentrating on yourself and you 'll get there if you work hard and you 'll reach your goals			2
i thought the students might be shy but they were asking me loads of questions and for advice			0
part of why i 'm doing what i 'm doing is to try to talk to younger guys and try to inspire them to do what they want to do			0
not just in sport , in terms of music or politics or art. the sprinter helped @entity75 win the gold medal in the 4x100m relay race in @entity78 , @entity79 i want to be a good role model and lead by example			1
if i can do that , then i 'm happy doing what i 'm doing			0
i got back into training at the start of october time , trying to get my body back in shape , and it 's coming together well			1
at some point i 'll arrange a race with @entity11			0
everyone who i meet always wants to race me			0
everyone thinks they 're quick and could beat me			0
it 's only a bit of fun			0
my reaction : you 're more than welcome to try			0
@entity99 celebrates victory with @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 money raised by @entity106 players has been changing lives for 20 years			0
£ 32 billion has gone to sport , the arts , charities and heritage projects across the @entity75 .			0
