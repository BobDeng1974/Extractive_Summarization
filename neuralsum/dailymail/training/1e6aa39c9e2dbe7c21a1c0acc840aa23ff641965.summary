by @entity1 reporter published : 19:53 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 19:53 est , 13 june 2012 behold the bonobo , our ape cousin that 's kinder and gentler than the chimpanzee or , well , us			1
now scientists have mapped the primate 's dna , and some researchers believe that may eventually reveal secrets about how the darker side of our nature evolved			0
scientists have found that we are as close genetically to the peace - loving but little - known bonobo as we are to the more violent and better understood chimpanzee			1
it 's as if they are siblings and we are cousins , related to them both equally , sharing some traits with just bonobos and other characteristics with only chimps			1
mates : human beings were believed to have a similar genetic blueprint to bonobos , an endangered species which can only be found in the @entity30 region of @entity31 bonobos and humans share 98.7 per cent of the same genetic blueprint , the same percentage shared with chimps , according to a study released today by the journal @entity39			1
the two apes are much more closely related to each other - sharing 99.6 per cent of their genomes - said study lead author @entity44 , a geneticist at the @entity45 in @entity46			1
he said : ' humans are a little like a mosaic of bonobo and chimpanzee genomes			1
' bonobos and chimps have distinctly different behaviors that can be seen in humans , with bonobos displaying what might be thought of as our better angels , said @entity61 researcher @entity60			1
@entity52 make love , not war			0
chimps have been documented to kill and make war			2
bonobos share food with total strangers , but chimps do not			2
@entity52 stay close to their mothers - who even pick out their sons ' mates - long after infancy like humans			2
but chimps tend to use tools better and have bigger brains , like humans			2
' is the bonobo genome the secret to the biology of peace ? ' asked @entity60 , who was not involved in the new research			0
' they have done something in their evolution that even humans ca n't do			2
they do n't have the dark side we do			0
' if we only studied chimps , we 'd get a skewed view of human evolution , ' he said			0
@entity97 and wild : a mother tends to a baby bonobo in their natural habitat of the @entity102 @entity52 , chimps and humans shared a single common ancestor from about six million years ago , @entity44 said			1
chimps and bonobos shared the same common ancestor until about a million years ago , when the @entity30 formed			1
then the bonobos developed on one side of the river , the chimps the other			2
they became different species , even though scientists did n't realize that until about 90 years ago			1
bonobo heads are slightly smaller and their teeth are arranged differently			0
in behavior , bonobos are far more tolerant and social			0
instead of releasing tension by fighting , they couple repeatedly , @entity60 said			0
bonobos are ruled by alpha females , chimps by males			1
in some ways - especially when looking at the physiology of the brain - it 's as if a bonobo is a juvenile chimp that does n't develop , @entity60 said			1
chimps get more violent as they age ; bonobos do n't			1
the scientific name for bonobos is @entity52			0
@entity60 said : ' they never grow up and we have lots of data to support this idea			0
much of their psychology seems to be frozen			0
' some researchers say @entity60 has romanticized the bonobo too much			0
@entity148 researcher @entity147 says he has more bonobo scars than chimp scars on his body			0
sure , bonobos will bite , but they wo n't kill , @entity60 said			2
bonobos are endangered and only live around the war - torn @entity102			1
' ironically , ' @entity60 said , ' @entity52 are from the place where people are at their worst			0

humans are a ' mosaic ' of bonobo and chimpanzee genomes
bonobos live only in the war - torn @entity102
do n't fight but mate repeatedly ( and ruled by alpha females )
chimps and bonobos were only discovered to be different species 90 years ago
