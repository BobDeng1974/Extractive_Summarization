touchingly , sister @entity1 obliged with two – a kiss from her , and one on behalf of his mother back home in @entity16			1
later that day @entity17 , aged just 21 , breathed his last , with @entity18 – then aged 38 – recording his poignant death in her harrowing but moving diaries , which have now been published as a book			1
as a result , relatives of @entity17 have been able to meet the descendants of @entity18 and finally give recognition to her extraordinary act of compassion 97 years ago today			2
previously a clerk at a cotton warehouse , private @entity2 joined the 2nd @entity32 and was sent to northern @entity33 in november 1915			1
but four months later he was suffering from pneumonia after apparently being gassed in the trenches and moved to a field hospital near @entity37			2
there he was cared for by @entity18 , known as @entity39 , a nurse from @entity40 in @entity41 , who signed up for military service soon after the war broke out			0
in her diaries , she wrote of how ‘ my poor little boy @entity2 ’ had spent 15 days ‘ extremely and dangerously ill ’ before it finally became clear he would n’t recover			1
her notes described march 12 , 1916 as ‘ a difficult day to be “ sister ” ’ , with private @entity2 whispering messages for his fiancee and begging : ‘ when i ’m gone , will you kiss me ? ’ despite the many injured soldiers beseeching her attention , she recorded : ‘ i did kiss the boy – first for his mother and then for myself – which pleased him			1
’ after he died , she ensured he was ‘ decently put in the mortuary ’ , subsequently returning to plant primroses at his grave			0
the exchange between sister @entity1 and private @entity2 was revealed in her war diaries she kept @entity2 is pictured with the 17th @entity63 but relatives do n't know which one is him more than 90 years later , her great - nephew @entity66 had the diaries edited and published as @entity68 – a nurse at @entity70 , before setting out to contact relatives of her patients			1
among them was private @entity2 ’s great - great - niece @entity75 who found the diary entry online while researching her family ’s history			1
the pair met at the @entity80 in @entity81 where mr @entity66 was giving a talk about the book			0
mrs @entity75 , 42 , a mother of two from @entity85 , said reading about the care @entity17 received had been an intensely moving experience			1
‘ @entity88 seems like an angel to me , ’ she said			0
‘ she never left his side and she even wrote to his mother			2
’ the only photograph she has is of private @entity2 ’s platoon , and she does not know which is him			1
‘ it was a godsend to find that @entity2 was named in the book , ’ she added			2
‘ until then , i never knew he had a fiancee waiting for him back home			0
’ self portrait : @entity1 's diaries were often humorous and an illustration shows her uniform being blown up revealing stripy pyjamas underneath mr @entity66 has met two other relatives of those @entity18 cared for or worked with			1
he has listed all their names on – @entity104 – in the hope of tracking more down			0
‘ meeting relatives of soldiers like @entity2 is the most rewarding aspect of having brought @entity39 ’s diaries to life , ’ he said			1
@entity111 was awarded a military obe for her work with the @entity114			0
private @entity2 ’s body still lies in @entity118 cemetery , in northern @entity33			1
the @entity80 is hosting an exhibition called @entity120 about battlefield medicine and care , which runs until september			0
reunited by history : @entity66 ( the great nephew of @entity1 ) and wife @entity126 and @entity75 and @entity127 ( descendants of @entity2 ) met at the @entity80 , @entity128 march 6 , 1916 : busy day – poor @entity2 ( pneumonia etc , etc )			1
i am afraid will not weather the storm ... march 8 : i am writing to his mother and telling her so , she is evidently a refined old lady – writes back to say she is ‘ so glad to hear @entity135 is with us – the rest and good food will do him good ’			2
have my letters not reached her ? or wo n’t she understand that the boy is dying			2
march 10 : the day was very busy and poor @entity2 worse – i am sure that boy has been gassed & will die			1
should n’t be surprised to find his cot empty when i go on duty			0
poor mother – how will she take it ? march 12 : too much sadness to write about , besides being dead beat			2
march 13 : my poor little boy @entity2 died yesterday			1
he had been in 15 days suffering from gas , pneumonia , bronchitis and has been extremely and dangerously ill all the time , but only the day before yesterday he realised that he was not going to get well			0
i am glad to say we never left him night or day and he was fond of us all			0
yesterday was a difficult day to be ‘ sister ’			0
he kept whispering all sorts of messages for home and his fiancee			0
then he would call ‘ sister ’ and when i bent down to hear – ‘ i do love you			0
when i ’m gone , will you kiss me ? ’			0
all the time heads would be popping in ‘ sister this and sister that ’			0
but in spite of all , i did kiss the boy – first for his mother and then for myself – which pleased him .			2

@entity1 kissed private @entity2 once for his mother , once from herself
moving extracts from her diaries reveal she *grieved* for her ' poor little boy '
