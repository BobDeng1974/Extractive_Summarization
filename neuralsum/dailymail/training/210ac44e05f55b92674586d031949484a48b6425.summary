for more click here evidence : the pair recorded the video on this digital camera @entity72 , a news reporter at @entity64 affiliate @entity73 , told @entity74 : ' both @entity75 and @entity12 described the object as metallic , occasional blinking lights and moving at angles they have never seen any aircraft or object move before			1
