' the warnings come after tight security at @entity26 , with the @entity42 appearing at the @entity27 in @entity24 after it was locked down by dozens of visible armed police			2
a judge yesterday extended the detention of four suspects arrested in connection with an @entity50 terror plot just two days earlier			0

tensions have been raised by a slew of terror arrests amid fears @entity2 intervention against the @entity12 insurgency in @entity71 could motivate a string of new radicals in the @entity2			1

general sir @entity110 said terrorist fears must not stop @entity2 from leading their normal way of life speaking ahead of the @entity26 events , the @entity118 told @entity121 's @entity120 : ' i think the mood is definitely different this year but the biggest thing that makes the mood different , i think , is the intensity and the poignancy about it born of the aggregation of the 100 years commemoration of the @entity129 , the 70 years of d - day , i think the end of combat operations in @entity133			1
' but , certainly the proximity of the sense of threat for this weekend , which has intensified the nature of the security that 's attendant on it , has sort of contributed to quite a different feel about this year			2
