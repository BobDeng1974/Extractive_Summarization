@entity0 has spoken with several of his new managerial colleagues in @entity9 football 's top flight after landing a three - year contract at the @entity11			1
' a lot of them said " welcome to the madhouse "			2
in fact , pretty much every one of them has said that , ' said @entity0 , who revealed via his @entity17 account on friday night that he had officially retired as a player			1
' for me it has to be that way			2
you have to learn from what you have done , and that is what i am going to do			0
' i have it clear in my mind what i want , and though i am not going to say it 's going to be easy to get there , i will try to get there			1
' for me , @entity43 ( @entity44 manager ) was one of the best i spoke to , to be honest			2
' after the game ( against @entity4 ) he came in and spoke			1
it was a proper manager speaking			2
he was very honest about his group and my group and the way they work , why they do it			0
i found it very interesting			0
' there have been quite a few managers , and all of them i have spoken to have been good to me			0
they have been very supportive and encouraging			0
' ousted : @entity56 took charge of the club after @entity59 was sacked in february @entity60 : despite leading them to @entity62 victory just 12 months earlier adventurers : @entity65 's @entity64 celebrates their @entity67 win over @entity4 behind @entity68 @entity56 has been elevated from the head - coaching role he took on in early february after @entity4 dispensed with @entity59 's managerial services			1
during that time , despite a few setbacks in terms of results , he ultimately guided @entity4 away from relegation danger and towards mid-table heading into sunday 's season finale at @entity78			1
' it has n't really sunk in			0
all i have been thinking about is the games , ' he added			0
' everything that happened in the week was great , but we 've got a game on sunday			0
i went home and i was just planning the training sessions for the next day and what i would say to the players regarding the @entity78 game			0
i did n't want to make it too much of a distraction to anyone else			0
' because it 's not about me right now , it 's about finishing the season , and i guess when i get to the summer i will probably reflect upon what has gone on and the magnitude of it			1
' for his part , @entity4 chairman @entity98 has no doubt about @entity56 's qualities			1
the @entity102 have a track record for getting managerial appointments right , as shown by former bosses like @entity106 and @entity107 , and @entity98 feels that @entity0 is from a familiar mould			0
pedigree : former @entity4 bosses @entity106 and @entity107 now running @entity111 ' like every decision we make , whatever manager you bring in is a gamble			1
you only have to look to other @entity5 clubs to see what has gone on to see that 10 or so managers have changed , " @entity98 said			0
' that argument is completely overshadowed by the fact every club needs , first and foremost , good people you can work with and people you think will take on the challenge , and i think as always at our club look to build their experience and improve things and set their mark			2
' the biggest qualities are commitment and a passion for the job and working for @entity4 with the way we want to work			1
he ( @entity56 ) has got the thirst to learn and grow in experience			1
' the other side is every young manager in his position will make mistakes , like experienced managers do			2
you just hope while he 's learning we still carry on and achieve success , that is all you can hope for			2
' he has got ideas and thoughts of how he would like to implement some of the way we work in the backroom staff like other managers have , and i can see that growing as he gains in confidence as he goes along			0
