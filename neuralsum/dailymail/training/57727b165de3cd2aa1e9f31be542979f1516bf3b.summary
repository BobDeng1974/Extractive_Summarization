by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:03 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 05:48 est , 23 may 2013 we may have been married for 20 years but , until this week , i had never sent my wife a love letter , writes @entity6			1
nor had she ever sent one to me			2
to be honest , they always seemed a bit , well , un-british			2
and unbefitting to a couple in their early 50s , with three children , the oldest at university			2
but when i heard that @entity17 actress @entity16 and her husband , the singer @entity15 , exchange frequent love letters , it set me thinking			1
if they do it , why ca n’t we ? so , would our first ever love letters set our suburban household alight ? still making each other laugh after 20 years : @entity0 and @entity1 my @entity26 @entity1 , the great essayist @entity27 once wrote that age does not protect you from love , but that ‘ love , to some extent , protects you from age ’			1
that is what i feel , with all my heart			2
at 51 , i suppose i am in the earlyish autumn of my years			1
at any rate , if i were a tree , i ’d be shedding a few rust - coloured leaves			1
but i do n’t mind			2
it will be fun to shed them together , and regain the independence we had before the children were born			2
weekends away at the drop of a hat			0
do you remember all those hats we used to drop ? i wondered , when contemplating this letter , whether to quote @entity52 , who was so good at expressions of love			1
but using other people ’s lines , even @entity27 ’s , is a cop - out			1
besides , everybody ’s version of love is different			1
inspiration : actress @entity16 and her musician husband @entity15 exchange frequent love letters who honestly believes , as the actress @entity68 once put it , that love means never having to say you ’re sorry ? i ’ve said a million sorries to you - and you , getting on for , what , 11 or 12 to me ? did that make you laugh ? i hope so , because for you and me , love and laughter are indivisible			1
ten years ago , when i wrote a book about our move from the city to the country , i dedicated it ‘ to @entity1 , the wind beneath my wings , the compost beneath my beans ’			1
in some ways , that said it all			0
i wanted you to know what you meant to me , and what you have done for me , but i banged in a gag to pre-empt any accusations of soppiness			0
in a way , i do wish i could reach for one of @entity52 ’s sonnets to tell you how much i love you			1
and if i were to compare thee to a summer ’s day , it would be that early - evening bit when i pour two glasses of chilled rosé and we sit at the garden table , watching the dogs chasing each other round the lawn			1
one of those moments of such profound happiness that they elicit not a smile , but a sigh			0
on their wedding day : @entity0 proposed on a beach in @entity116 i know that writing a public love letter to me will make you wince , since you do n’t even believe in going out on @entity119			1
i ca n’t claim to be @entity120 , either			0
but i fancy you just as much as i did when i first sat at your desk in the newspaper office where you were deputy news editor and i was a novice reporter			0
who ’d have thought then that we ’d end up making three children together ? more than two decades on , i ’m still as beguiled by those amazing greeny - blue eyes as much as i ever was			1
more than anything else , though , i respect and admire you , for your interest in the world , for your wit , for your intelligence , for your incredible culinary skills , for your kindness to your friends , and above all , for your endless commitment , patience and resourcefulness as a mother			0
i have to admit that when you were pregnant with @entity140 , our firstborn , i was worried			0
part of what had so attracted me to you was your no - nonsense professionalism in the workplace , and i did n’t know what would replace that , when , if only temporarily , you gave up work			1
it was hopelessly naïve of me not to realise that , overnight , your skills as a mother would seem more important to both of us than your skills in your job			0
but then , it is hopelessly naïve of any couple to embark on a life together expecting it to be sun - kissed most of the way through			1
yet , even in this peculiar age of pre-nuptial agreements , we all do it			0
well , i think our 20 years of marriage have , indeed , been more sun - kissed than not			1
that particular naïve expectation came true			0
and even in times of drizzle , i have never wanted to share the umbrella with anyone but you.i love you			1
and thank you , for everything			0
yours husband , @entity178 @entity179 , not usually romantic : @entity1 is unaccustomed to making declarations of love love letters			1
not sure what i think , since any written declaration of love sounds borrowed from some other , more lyrical writer , and anyway , i come from a long line of @entity189 women - a species not known for their romanticism			1
and you already know that i love you , because i sometimes defy my @entity189 heritage and say so			1
not so often that the words lose their meaning , but not so rarely that you could ever forget			0
but declarations of love , i think , mean more when they ’re made at surprising moments , not when they ’re flagged up by marketing men at @entity199			1
this is why you and i give @entity119 a body swerve - although if it were n’t for me , you ’d be more of a chocolates and flowers man yourself			2
you ’re a natural romantic , and i ’m really not			0
i love you with all my heart , but i laughed when you proposed , on that deserted beach in @entity116 , in 1992			2
and worse , perhaps , than sniggering at the @entity207 , was year after year forgetting our wedding anniversary			0
we were married on january 7 ( for a while i thought it was january 5 ) and i still maintain it ’s a terrible day for an anniversary			0
first day back to school after @entity215 more often than not ; lunchboxes to prepare , plimsolls to find , children to corral			0
harassed and harried , i would pass you at the front door , give you a cursory goodbye , and you would wait until then to say : ‘ happy anniversary , darling ’			0
it has been my very good fortune to have married a man who laughs in the face of such casual neglect , enjoying the joke of a stereotype being turned on its head			0
this is because you have a dear , forgiving nature from which i ( sharp - tongued sometimes and not always very fair ) benefit , time and again			2
your love for me is sustaining and humbling , and although i appear to be taking it for granted , it underpins my life			2
i ’m better at the anniversaries these days , because i do think it ’s important to honour and cherish a husband as loving and gracious as you are			2
and you ’re the funniest person i know ; even your @entity241 moments make me laugh , and after the joke , your laughter makes me laugh : that shoulder - heaving , almost silent laughter that usually ends with you getting wheezy			2
still happy together : the couple have raised three children when you look back over our two decades of marriage , does it make you smile to think of all the times we have laughed ? twenty years , @entity0 ! i ’m sure we felt like adults when we married , but we ’ve grown up together			1
we ’ve had children , moved house , navigated stormy waters			0
i ’ve always depended on you , and always known i could			0
you are my safe harbour			0
i worry , you reassure			0
so often you ’ve said to me : ‘ if you want to know our future , look at our past , ’ and although none of us really knows what lies ahead , i can almost believe that you do			0
so , what this unromantic @entity267 lass would like to say is , thank you for remaining , through thick and thin , my lovely , lovely husband : handsome , generous , courteous , and full of love for me and for the children ( who thanks to you can all throw and catch a ball , have almost perfect table manners , love a good sunset and never forget to clean their teeth			1
) the wonderful , mysterious alchemy between us that produced our offspring is a source of daily joy , and as good a testament to our love as any i could wish for			2
they ’re nearly grown now , and before too long it ’ll be you and me again , so , this is the plan			0
we ’ll hire a classic car — a two - seater , and you can choose — and take a lengthy , leisurely drive through @entity292 , staying in auberges and eating in those restaurants that we read about and never visit			2
it ’ll be a second honeymoon for my funny valentine and me			0
@entity1 x touched : @entity0 is glad they put pen to paper despite our misgivings and fears , our love letters have touched us both			1
what we said was truly heartfelt			0
moreover , there was the added dimension of distance between us when we wrote them , for i was in the @entity310 , on a writing assignment , and @entity1 was at home in north @entity313			1
the next challenge will be to exchange love letters when i am upstairs at my computer , and she is downstairs at hers			1
but i really think we might .			0
