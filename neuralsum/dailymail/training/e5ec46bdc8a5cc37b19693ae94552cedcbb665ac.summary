@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 - all previous @entity6 no 9s , owners of the most iconic shirt in the @entity9 ’ history			1
ever since the days of @entity12 , the famous jersey has always belonged to @entity6 ’s main man in the box , the predator in front of goal and , certainly in @entity19 ’s case , the marksman who could ruffle a few of the opponents ’ feathers			2
the shirt has always held a special meaning at @entity26			0
however the current incumbent of @entity6 ’s most sought - after shirt is yet to make anywhere near the same impact as his much - loved predecessors			2
@entity6 striker @entity32 made an eagerly - awaited return from injury in the @entity35 @entity32 bursts through the @entity38 side 's defence before releasing a shot without success the @entity42 forward produced a bright performance that was only missing a comeback goal @entity32 - through no fault of his own it must be said - has had a nightmare 18 months at @entity6 following his £ 6million arrival from @entity48 in the summer of 2013			1
the @entity42 arrived on @entity49 with former @entity51 boss @entity50 as the man to spearhead the @entity54 ’s blue revolution			2
however , after a less than convincing start to life at @entity6 – which included fluffing relatively easy chances at home to @entity60 and against @entity61 in the @entity62 - the striker was injured , ending his debut season prematurely			2
now , having returned to fitness , @entity32 was desperate to open his @entity6 account having watched his team - mates struggle for form this term after last season ’s impressive fifth - placed finish			1
@entity32 battles for the ball with @entity73 's @entity72 as he presses for a goal @entity32 was active across the pitch and found some dangerous positions on the left - click here for more stats from our @entity79 the 31 - year - old argues with referee @entity82 after receiving a caution ‘ if i did manage to score it would be fantastic , ’ said @entity32 on wednesday			1
‘ it would represent the beginning of a big comeback			0
i ’ve got such a huge passion to get my first goal for @entity6			2
’ taking to the field as the lone frontman , @entity32 , distinctive with his bright white hair , strutted around the pitch before kick - off like @entity95 9s of old			1
clearly confident and raring to go , the former @entity96 forward made an encouraging start			0
on ten minutes the @entity42 barged his opponent off the ball and cut inside with pace before running into a @entity101			0
dispossessed but showing the intent up front the @entity26 faithful expect from their strikers			0
@entity1 ( left ) and @entity0 set the benchmark for @entity6 's most loved strikers @entity108 celebrates after scoring what would be the winning goal for @entity73 @entity32 and @entity111 ( right ) look dejected after @entity6 go behind in what was essentially a dead rubber five minutes later and his dream comeback looked on			1
finding space from 20 yards out , the play opened up for @entity32 who , sensing an opportunity to score his first goal in the blue of @entity6 , took aim and unleashed a powerful effort as @entity73 keeper @entity123 made a smart save to his right			1
buoyed by the crowds reactions to his efforts , @entity32 then attempted an overhead kick – it may have gone away from goal but supporters appreciated his audaciousness			0
the striker seemed to be revelling at being back on the pitch in a competitive game			0
the second half saw a much quieter @entity32 but showing a glimpse of skill to work his way into the box after jinking past a helpless defender certainly got the crowd on their feet			0
having doubted his capabilities following his first few months at the club , @entity32 may have changed fan opinion based on thursday ’s showing			0
@entity32 made 25 passes and two shots on target - click here for more stats from our brilliant @entity79 @entity32 joined @entity6 manager @entity50 to answer questions ahead of the game the striker cut short his summer holidays and stayed at @entity156 in a bid to improve his fitness and seems determined to make his mark at @entity26 and did his case no harm in this dead - rubber despite failing to find a goal			1
after an encouraging performance , should @entity32 can stay fit , @entity6 , who also boast @entity165 and @entity166 among their striking ranks , may just have a trio of attackers as good as any other in this season ’s @entity35			1
there is still much , much more to do to become the next great @entity95 9 but the desire and intent is there from @entity32 .			0

@entity6 lost 1 - 0 to @entity73 in their final @entity35 group game
@entity42 forward @entity32 made his long awaited return from injury
the 31 - year - old looked bright but needs to improve before if he can be considered among iconic no 9s like @entity1 and @entity0
