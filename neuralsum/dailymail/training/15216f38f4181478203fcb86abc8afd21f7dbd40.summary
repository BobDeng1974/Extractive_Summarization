' we call her @entity1 when she 's in episode , she is unpleasant and it 's like she has severe behavioural problems			2
' she goes from being like a zombie and ignoring me or huffing and puffing , to like a two - year - old , bouncing off the walls			2
' @entity1 is now afraid to go to sleep in case she does n't wake up again			2
it 's been soul destroying to watch because she once had everything going for her			2
' the disorder struck at 14 when @entity1 came home from school one day and passed out face - down on the sofa			2
the teenager finds she is scared to go to sleep as she does n't know when she will wake up mrs @entity7 found her son @entity58 , eight , jumping on @entity1 and laughing			1

' @entity1 was taken to hospital after she fell asleep unexpectedly while on the stairs			0
even doctors could n't wake her and were baffled by her behaviour			2
@entity1 has no memory of her strange behaviour after the episode @entity1 had hoped to become a professional basketball player but now can fall asleep on the court doctors thought she might be epileptic but after running tests , could find nothing medically wrong with @entity1 so sent her home			1

episodes can come on very quickly and last between a few days to a few weeks			1
during such an episode a sufferer may be irritable , childish , disorientated and want to eat excessive amounts of food			2

@entity1 is just one of 1,000 people worldwide to suffer from the disorder which is commonly known as @entity31			1
70 % of sufferers are male			0
there is no known cure for the sleeping disorder , and the main treatment is watchful waiting at home by loved ones			2
research suggests episodes decrease in frequency and intensity over the course of 8 to 12 weeks			1
in order to be officially diagnosed with @entity31 , doctors must exclude all other possibilities			1
@entity1 said : ' most doctors have n't even heard of @entity31			1
to an outsider , it could look like i 'm skiving or insane			0
' they thought i could be narcoleptic , schizophrenic or be suffering from chronic fatigue			2
but i had seen a documentary about kls and both me and my mum knew that 's what it was			0
' @entity31 usually strikes in adolescence and the main symptoms are long and disturbed sleep , altered behaviour and excessive appetite			1
the cause of @entity31 is unknown but it can often be triggered by an infection or head injury			1
@entity1 now needs full - time care as when she is in episode , she can be a danger to herself and others			1
she said : ' i 've woken up before and my hands have been covered in blood and my knuckles have been all bruised			0
' when i looked in the mirror i had this big bruise on my forehead ! my mum said i 'd been punching a wall over and over again and smashing my head against a cupboard			0
