i ’m a trained chef and it ’s what i love doing most			1
but still , there are some things i just do n’t have time to make			2
jars of factory - made pesto and mayonnaise are regulars on my shopping list			1
and there are dishes that never seem to work out , such as my pavlovas , which often flop or crack			1
i ’m sure i ’m not the only busy mum who often wishes i had an extra pair of hands in the kitchen			2
my husband is too busy with very important meetings to help with the cooking , and our daughters , aged nine and ten , are too young to be trusted with tasks much beyond making cupcakes			2
at £ 925 , the @entity30 is expensive — but if it ’s as adept as is claimed , it will be worth every penny			1
my new best friend is not so much a food processor as a mini robot			2
it was invented in 1971 by @entity43 company @entity42 and is loved by @entity45 - starred chefs from @entity46 to @entity47			2
besides blending , it can heat , chop and stir , as well as taking the slog out of tricky dishes such as risotto and mayonnaise as well as whipping up an instant sorbet or ice cream			1
now it has been overhauled for the 21st - century home kitchen			2
most impressively , it has a touch screen that displays recipes and step - by - step guidance on making bread , cakes , soups , salads , mousses and more			2
as well as taking the slog out of tricky dishes such as risotto and mayonnaise it whips up an instant sorbet or ice cream the grey and white machine looks like a medical testing kit — a metal jug on a white base with a few knobs and a small screen			1
the base contains scales , with the weight shown on the display , so you can add 200g of butter , reset the scale to zero on the touchscreen , then add 200g of flour and so on			1
the machine can also heat up the jug to 120c , so dishes can be warmed to specific temperatures			1
inside the jug are four super-sharp blades attached to a motor which , at the highest setting , can pulverise fruit , vegetables , herbs and even dried beans in seconds			2
the base contains scales , with the weight shown on the display , so you can add 200g of butter , reset the scale to zero on the touchscreen , then add 200g of flour and so on			1
to start , you turn on the machine and select the cookery book option on the screen			2
there are 200 recipes to choose from and you get a step - by - step run - through of each			2
once all ingredients have been added , the display states the speed required			1
the machine is programmed to know how long the motor must run and the temperature required			2
more complex dishes require ingredients to be added throughout the process , in which case the @entity30 stops and waits for you to do so			1
once the new ingredient is added , you select ‘ next ’ again			2
when the recipe is completed , the display says ‘ done ’			1
frankly , i thought the machine sounded too good to be true , so i decided to test out eight recipes including time - consuming risotto and the pesto i usually buy			1
is it just another maddening gadget ? or the miracle aid busy mums have been waiting for ? mayonnaise the egg mixture often splits when i make mayo , so this will surely put the machine to the test			1
i crack an egg into the machine and add lemon juice , mustard powder , salt and pepper , and run the motor for 90 seconds while drizzling 300g of sunflower oil through the hole in the top of the jug onto the egg mixture			2
at the end , the machine turns itself off , i look in the bowl and am amazed to find wonderfully glossy mayonnaise — perfect for my lunchtime sandwich			1
verdict this took less than two minutes and tastes far superior to anything you get in the supermarket			2
rustic bread there ’s nothing like freshly baked bread , but it ’s tricky to do well			1
the @entity30 prompts me to add pre-measured amounts of water , buttermilk and yeast to the jug			1
on a touch of the ‘ next ’ button , the jug heats to 32 degrees — the perfect heat for yeast — and i set the dial to a gentle ‘ 2 ’ so it stirs rather than whizzes			1
then i am told to add 600g flour , plus salt , balsamic vinegar and malt extract , which i weigh into the jug as instructed			2
when i next start the machine it works in reverse , gently kneading the dough , rather than chopping it			0
then i can tip out my soft , springy dough and leave it to rise , before baking in the oven			0
verdict the most delicious , wholesome bread i have ever tasted			0
yoghurt cake the @entity30 screen tells me to preheat the oven and grease my round bundt pan ( for a cake with a hole in the middle )			1
then i follow the instructions to add lemon zest and sugar and turn the motor			0
next , in go three eggs , which unfortunately i do have to crack myself			0
these are followed by flour , yogurt , sunflower oil , salt and baking powder , which i pour through the same hole into the jug			0
a minute of whizzing at speed six and my batter is ready to pour into the tin to bake in the oven			0
verdict a superb , light , fluffy cake made in less than half the time it would usually take me			0
strawberry and banana sorbet i measure 60g of sugar into the @entity30 and blitz it at speed seven for ten seconds to make it super-fine			1
then i add 500g of frozen strawberries and some bananas , together with an egg white and a squeeze of lemon juice , then whizz for 90 seconds			0
stunning sorbet , ready to eat			1
verdict this is like magic and the sorbet is incredibly moreish			1
@entity243 salad i ’m cynical as i start making this			0
after all , salads are easy and i am the queen of chopping			0
still , i add four scrubbed and trimmed beetroots , two carrots , an apple , shallot , a little oil , salt , sugar and lemon juice and whizz it for — wait for it — five seconds			0
i ’m surprised to find perfect chopped salad ( far smaller and neater than i could chop ) , dressed and ready to serve			0
verdict delicious and possibly the easiest food i ’ve ever made			0
risotto i find risotto a chore to make with all that stirring , so i ca n’t wait to see if the @entity30 makes it more quickly			1
first i add 80g of @entity264 , whizz it so it is grated finely and tip into a small bowl			0
then i add a shallot , whizz that , then butter and olive oil , which the machine weighs for me			0
next the machine stirs and heats everything — sauteeing my shallot perfectly			1
i add rice and white wine , which bubbles for one minute , followed by stock , seasoning and a pinch of saffron			0
the machine cooks and stirs the mixture for 13 minutes			1
when it ’s done , i add the @entity264			0
verdict this is as good as any i have had in an @entity285 restaurant			0
pesto i whizz the @entity264 in the machine for 15 seconds			0
i add pine nuts , garlic , basil leaves , salt and extra virgin olive oil , and blitz it for 20 seconds			0
pesto , done in less than a minute			0
verdict i can not believe that fresh pesto can be made in less than a minute and taste this good			0
i ’ll never buy a jar again			0
profiteroles choux pastry involves lots of bicep - busting stirring , so i rarely bother			0
to make choux in a @entity30 , you simply add water , butter and flour to the machine			1
it heats and stirs everything until a smooth consistency is achieved			1
after the jug has cooled , you crack in three eggs while the mixture is being stirred — and that is it			0
pipe or spoon the dough onto baking sheets and bake			0
verdict even @entity323 ’s @entity321 and @entity322 would be impressed with these			0
conclusion hold a car boot sale and sell off your kitchen appliances			0
then buy yourself a @entity30 !			1
