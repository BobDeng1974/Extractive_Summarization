by @entity1 reporter published : 14:53 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 05:11 est , 31 july 2013 if @entity4 is the language of love and @entity7 is the language of business , then where does that leave the @entity11 vernacular ? with its strong consonants and sharp vowels , to many the @entity11 tongue can sound a little harsh compared to some of its continental counterparts			1
now , a video posted online has demonstrated just how some of the most delicate and demure words in other languages can sound guttural and even angry when spoken in @entity11			1
in an amusing comparison words such as ' butterfly ' , ' daisy ' and even ' pen ' sound jarring and severe when spoken in @entity11 - with a little help from the actor 's choice of expression , of course			1
dressed in lederhosen and with a pint of wheat beer sat next to him , the @entity11 man makes the words sound angry and coarse when he translates the words into ' schmetterling ' , ' gänseblümchen ' and ' kugelschreiber ' respectively			1
ascribing to the most basic of national stereotypes , the @entity4 woman wears a beret and striped top while a glass of red wine and a baguette lie on the table in front of her			0
the @entity34 character holds an umbrella and has what appears to be a pot of tea while the @entity40 looks to be enjoying a bowl of spaghetti bolognese with his glass of wine			0
the @entity79 meanwhile is not only wearing a sombrero , but he also has his guitar beside him along with a bottle of beer which is flavoured with tequila			0
' @entity85 ' : despite being known for their passion , the @entity40 language can sound lyrical and romantic ' @entity90 ' : the @entity41 word for ' surprise ' sounds quite a bit different to the @entity11 version despite its reputation for being harsh the @entity11 language is loved by many across the globe			2
for some , the language 's logic and its set of rules are among its most attractive features while others simply enjoy the way it sounds			2
@entity11 is a @entity108 language and is one of the world 's major languages			2
it is related to both @entity7 and @entity113 and the majority of its vocabulary comes from the @entity108 branch of the @entity118			0
there is however a number of words which do derive from @entity122 and @entity123 .			0

video demonstrates just how different words sound in different languages
@entity11 words for ' daisy ' and ' *science* ' sound harsh and angry in video
