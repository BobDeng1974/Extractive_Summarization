in football an own goal is a reasonably common occurrence , but in rugby an ' own try ' is not something that has ever happened before			2
until thursday night anyway , when an extraordinary incident took place in the @entity9 match at the @entity10 between the @entity11 and @entity12			1
fans and players alike at the @entity16 venue were stunned when referee @entity17 awarded the ' own try ' against @entity12 forward @entity19 during the @entity11 ' 49 - 40 win			1
to make the situation even more ludicrous , @entity17 made the decision having consulted the television match official ( @entity24 )			1
referee @entity17 is n't sure about the try so asks for the advice of the television match official @entity27 rays forward @entity19 ( right centre on floor ) grounds the ball ( centre ) inside his own try line despite the video footage showing @entity19 grounded the ball , the referee awards a bizarre ' own - try ' @entity19 looks on stunned as the referee awards the try - he said after he was waiting to ' pack and scrum down ' the incident occurred in the 21st minute of the @entity9 clash , with the @entity11 attacking the @entity12 ' line			1
@entity19 ripped the ball from @entity44 hooker @entity43 , and placed it back over his own line , thinking he 'd conceded a five - metre scrum			1
referee @entity17 was unsure about what had happened so referred the decision to @entity24 @entity49 to see if @entity43 had scored			1
despite it being clear that it was @entity19 who grounded the ball , referee @entity17 awarded the try to the @entity11 as the @entity12 forward looked on in astonishment			1
the official scoresheet for the match credited the controversial try to @entity43 , who was the closest @entity43 player to the ball			1
@entity44 missed the subsequent conversion but the five points helped them to their 49 - 40 win			1
reflecting on the incident @entity19 told the @entity66 @entity65 , ' i will be a walking , talking trivia question for a long time i guess			2
' a disbelieving @entity19 later admitted , ' i will be a walking , talking trivia question for a long time i guess ' ' i ripped the ball out and i had possession of it			2
i went to place it and as i was placing it back i was n't sure if i should put it over the line			0
' i thought it would be a five - metre scrum and i thought that would actually be the safest option			0
' when the referee decided to go upstairs , i could n't believe it but i thought , @entity24 will see it , fine , we 'll still be safe			0
' i was waiting to pack and scrum down			0
' then the decision came back for the try			0
you have probably seen the video , you can probably see my reaction			0
i could n't believe it			0
i was trying to process it , i was a bit puzzled and bemused			0
i did n't know what to do , i thought with all today 's technology it 'd be sweet			0
we 'd seen it but i do n't know how they missed it			0
' it 's unlikely @entity19 will be involved in an incident as strange as this again .			2
