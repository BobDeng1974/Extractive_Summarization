by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham criticism : @entity2 has claimed @entity4 officials have let players down @entity2 has criticised @entity4 officials for running their national team badly and claims they have ' let down ' their international players			1
the midfielder was at the heart of a period of @entity12 domination in the late 1990s and early 2000s when they won the @entity13 on home soil and then the @entity15 two years later			1
but he believes the structure in place back then was allowed to crumble by those running football in the country			2
' in @entity4 you are talking about @entity22 and some of the other players having personal issues , ' @entity2 said			1
' but @entity22 never had a problem with @entity26			1
they talk about @entity28 , but he never had a problem with @entity30			1
@entity31 never had a problem at @entity33			2
' so i think it is the structure that creates that kind of problem			0
the @entity12 national team has to look at itself , how the structure is done			1
that is not as strong as @entity26 , @entity33 or @entity30			0
' the problem is that you need people above who dictate the rules			0
when you have a kid , who are shown the rules , the kids know where to stand and what to do and what not to do			0
' if there are no rules , people do what they want			0
the structure in the @entity12 national team in the last few years was n’t at the best			1
' shock : @entity22 was left out of @entity4 's provisional @entity13 squad , supposedly for disciplinary reasons @entity2 , however , feels the tide is finally turning following recent turbulent years			1
they crashed out of the 2008 @entity65 and 2010 @entity13 in the group stage , one of their worst results in either competition			2
' when i was playing it was a different structure , ' @entity2 added , speaking at the launch of @entity75 's coverage of the @entity13 in @entity76 this summer			1
' every player knew where they were , what they had to do and how they had to behave			0
' when i was there , the majority of the players had big experience			2
i think the average age was around 30			0
in the last few years the @entity12 team had been a bit younger			2
' when you are young you need more people around to support you , and i think the players have been let down by the structure around them			0
' it has changed because they have a new president now , who has been working and been changing the manager and people around him			0
' now i think the @entity12 team is more solid and when you look at what they ’ve been doing in the last few games it ’s because the structure around is more clear			0
' ready : @entity108 ( left ) , @entity106 ( second right ) and @entity107 take part in @entity4 training this week			1
