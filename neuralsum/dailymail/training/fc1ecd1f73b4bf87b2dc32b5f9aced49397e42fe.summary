the record of conversations from the 1969 @entity11 mission reveal that the spacemen had to tackle some tricky toilet - related issues			1
it suggests that @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 had not entirely got to grips with how to use the spacecraft ’s bathroom facilities			2
the record of conversations from the 1969 moon mission reveal that the spacemen had to tackle some tricky toilet - related issues caught short : it suggests that ( pictured from left ) @entity26 pilot @entity17 , commander @entity15 and @entity27 pilot @entity16 had difficulty mastering the spacecraft 's bathroom facilities @entity30 10 was the fourth manned mission in the @entity33 @entity30 space programme			1
it was designed to be a ' dry run ' for @entity35 and tested all of the procedures required for a moon landing			2
it included a second crew to orbit the @entity11 and a lunar module in lunar orbit which came within nine nautical miles of the surface of the moon			2
the lengthy transcript exposes difficulties with floating human waste in the cockpit and gives an insight into the need for unusual napkin use			1
the troubles are first mentioned by the commander ( @entity54 ) , mr @entity15 , who said : ‘ give me a napkin quick			2
' there ’s a turd floating through the air			1
’ mr @entity16 , the @entity62 ( @entity63 ) , responds : ‘ i did n’t do it			2
it ai n’t one of mine			2
’ at which point mr @entity17 , the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) , added : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s one of mine			0
’ then mr @entity15 said : ‘ mine was a little more sticky than that			0
’ the discussion goes on – mr @entity17 : ‘ here ’s another goddamn turd			0
what ’s the matter with you guys ? here , give me a –			0
‘ well , babe , if it was me , i sure would know i was sh * tting on the floor			0

it was meant to be a chance to test all of the procedures involved in a @entity35 without actually landing on the @entity11 , but it did involve the use of a lunar module that came within nine nautical miles of the surface of the @entity11			0
the transcript goes on to show how the problem kept reoccurring newly discovered transcripts ( pictured ) from @entity4 's @entity3 mission have revealed that the astronauts came across some unexpected problems during the trip as the crew walked to the spacecraft they each touched the mission mascot , @entity111 former @entity113 commander @entity112 has lifted the lid on how astronauts aboard go to the toilet in space			1
personnel aboard the @entity113 often spend months at a time in space , so effective facilities for using the smallest room in zero gravity are essential			0
captain @entity112 , who holds the record for the longest space flight by a woman at 195 days , revealed details of the ' orbital outhouse ' in a video tour of the station			0
the toilet aboard the @entity113 revealed by @entity131 commander @entity112 her tour of the £ 12.5million facilities showed that it is apparently all a case of docking and alignment when it comes to going to the toilet in space			1
the toilet , she explains , unsurprisingly ' serves for two functions ' - number one and number two - with different colour - coded receptacles to accept each			1
pointing out the number two loo , she says : ' you see it 's pretty small and you have to have pretty good aim , and be ready to make sure things get let go in the right direction			0
' pinching her nose , she adds : ' and it smells a little bit , so i 'm closing it up			0
' ' also there 's a selection of paper , ' she says , including a soft kind for @entity33 astronauts and a coarser , rough variety preferred by @entity163 cosmonauts			2
captain @entity112 , a @entity164 test pilot pilot who has over seven missions spend a total of almost 322 days in space , says the crew are provided with gloves , nappies and disinfectant wipes , ' in case things really get out of control '			0
' the number one stuff can get really all over the place if you do n't aim correctly , ' she warns			0
although , she adds , both toilets have a little bit of suction to keep things ' going in the right direction '			0
