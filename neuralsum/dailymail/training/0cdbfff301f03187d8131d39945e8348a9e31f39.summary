by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 12:10 est , 20 march 2013 from the single person on £ 75,000 to a couple on £ 17,000 with two children , this graphic lays bare how you will be affected by tax changes from april			1
chancellor @entity6 announced today that the £ 10,000 personal tax allowance threshold will be reached in 2014 , a year ahead of schedule			1
but one analyst said the @entity10 largely ignored individuals and warned that the gains for all groups in this graphic do not take account of inflation			1
graphic : one analyst told @entity18 that the @entity10 largely ignored individuals and warned that the gains for all groups in this graphic do not take account of inflation @entity23 , partner at @entity24 chartered accountants , told @entity18 : ‘ take something like “ married couple with two schoolage children ”			1
‘ if they 've got gross income of £ 50,000 , their gain of £ 113 is 0.2 per cent			1
take out the inflation and they 're worse off to the tune of about 2 per cent			0
’ he added : ‘ there was much more done ( in the @entity10 ) at the lower level of income and it was positive			1
there was virtually nothing done , either positively or negatively , for those on higher income			1
‘ you 've also got the new employment allowance allowing a £ 2,000 cut in national insurance for an employer who 's taking on new employees			2
‘ i do n't think there ’s any particular incentive to have children , but there is more help			0
people are encouraged financially if they do have children			0
’ mr @entity23 used the graphic to compare the unmarried couple with two schoolage children and the married pensioner couple under 75			1
he said : ‘ you can see that the couple with the children are benefiting a lot more			2
the incomes are broadly similar			0
so that suggests additional help			0
’ another graphic ( right ) also showed a highly - paid professional earning less than twice the other one will be gaining more than twice the other			1
mr @entity23 said : ‘ it 's simply because the richer one is currently paying tax at 50 per cent on far more of their income than the other one			1
‘ so the cut to 45 per cent will benefit that person , so it 's really only to be expected as a result of the tax cut coming in next month			2
’ bringing forward the allowance rise to £ 10,000 will mean a cumulative cash benefit for typical basic rate taxpayers of £ 705 since the @entity82 began			2
from april , it will go up as planned to £ 9,440 - a £ 200 boost for 24million taxpayers			2
the basic and higher rates of income tax will remain the same			0
it will also mean 2.7 million working age adults have been taken out of income tax altogether in the new financial year			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ it 's a historic achievement for this government and for hard - working families across the country			0
’ the government has also stuck by its decision to reduce the top rate of tax on earnings over £ 150,000 from 50p to 45p next month			0
campaign group the @entity101 said the personal allowance increase would help to ease the burden of high living costs .			0
