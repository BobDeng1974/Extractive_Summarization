by @entity0 it goes against everything we 've been told about sun worshiping			0
but a new study has shown that women who avoid sunbathing during the summer are twice as likely to die than those who sunbathe everyday			1
researchers at the @entity9 in @entity10 claim guidelines which advise people to stay out of the sun unless wearing sun lotion may be harming us , rather than helping us			1
could sunbathing be good for us ? researchers say guidelines advising us to stay out of the sun may be harmful exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight is often cited as a cause of skin melanoma and the @entity25 recommends avoiding overexposure to the sun to prevent all types of skin cancer			1
but after following nearly 30,000 women over 20 years , the new research found that women who stay out of the sun are at increased risk of skin melanomas and are twice as likely to die from any cause , including cancer			1
the study 's lead author , dr @entity38 , said : ' the results of this study clearly showed that mortality was about double in women who avoided sun exposure compared to the highest exposure group			1
' sun exposure advice which is very restrictive in countries with low solar intensity might in fact be harmful for women ’s health			2
essential : our bodies need vitamin d , created through exposure to sunlight , to reduce the risk of illness ' the mortality rate was increased two-fold among avoiders of sun exposure as compared to those with the highest sun exposure habits			0
' a lack of vitamin d , which is created through exposure to the sun , is thought to be to blame , as it is known to increase the risk of diabetes , rickets , tuberculosis and multiple sclerosis			0
prof @entity73 , professor of cell biology at @entity75 , said : ' the findings support the consensus that the ideal amount of sun exposure for @entity81 @entity80 is ‘ a little ’ , rather than zero			0
' as the authors comment , our bodies need sunlight to make essential vitamin d , which can help us resist some cancer types			0
' those who normally avoid the sun and / or cover most of their skin are advised to take vitamin d supplements			2
' the research was published in @entity93 .			0
