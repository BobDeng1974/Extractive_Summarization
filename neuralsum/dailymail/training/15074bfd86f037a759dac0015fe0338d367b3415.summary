by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 08:38 est , 4 july 2013 ' negligent ' : @entity1 told a patient apparently suffering from bowel cancer to eat mangoes a scandal - hit gp told a patient displaying signs of bowel cancer that he should just eat some mangoes , a hearing has heard			1
the patient was really an undercover reporter investigating dr @entity1 , who had been allowed back to work despite failing to spot the symptoms of a cancer patient who later died			1
the reporter was working on a @entity17 documentary aired by @entity18 which aimed to expose wrongdoing by doctors who had previously been disciplined			0
@entity1 is now facing a fitness to practice hearing at the @entity22 in @entity23 , where he is accused of failing in his duty to two undercover ' patients ' , as well as writing a prescription while suspended			1
the @entity17 programme , broadcast in 2011 , appeared to show the doctor telling a journalist who was presenting standard symptoms of bowel cancer , ' get yourself some mangoes			1
' the reporter , referred to as ' @entity36 ' , visited @entity1 at his @entity38 surgery complaining of stomach pain , constipation and passing blood			1
the doctor spent much of the consultation talking on the phone before sending the patient away with laxatives			0
when he returned for a second consultation a month later with the same symptoms , he was simply given stronger constipation medication			2
' this man 's complaint was constipation , ' @entity1 told the tribunal yesterday			1
' when asked him to sit down , how i can help , he directly said to me constipation			0
' he put emphasis from the start to the end that he had constipation			0
if he did n't say it was constipation , i would look at it			0
' in 2006 , the gp was put under strict conditions after it emerged that he told a young mother suffering from cancer that she just had swollen glands			1
@entity68 went to see @entity1 in 2002 with a lump on her neck , but he only gave her paracetamol and later accused her of wasting his time when she returned			1
she died four years later aged 38 , and before her death she made a statement saying her illness ' would not have got to its stage or spread if dr @entity1 had done his job properly '			2
however , he was allowed to return to work unrestricted in 2009 after a panel found his fitness to practise was not impaired			2
death : @entity68 succumbed to cancer aged 38 after @entity1 told her she only had swollen glands he was suspended again after the @entity17 programme was broadcast two years later			1
another undercover reporter , known as ' @entity86 ' , told the doctor he had a ' funny feeling in his arm ' which his wife was worried about			2
@entity1 failed to take a proper medical history , examine the patient fully or provide a diagnosis on the basis of his symptoms , according to the @entity96			1
he is also accused of falsifying his notes on @entity36 , as well as writing a prescription for a third patient while he was forbidden from doing so			0
the gp claims he gave the two fake ' patients ' adequate consultations , and insists the prescription charge is the result of a ' conspiracy ' involving the chemist who reported him to the @entity96			2
' why is she ringing you and blaming me ? i never did it , i never would do it , ' he told the hearing			0
' why did n't she ring the police and say , " i 've got a patient here ? " ' this is somebody who has done it being very clever , trying to harm me by conspiring against me			0
this is a conspiracy of a high degree			0
' the hearing continues .			0
