cabin staff working for two major @entity3 airlines face losing their jobs for falling pregnant and are even required to get permission before they marry , outraged campaigners claim			1
according to the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) carriers based in @entity8 and the @entity9 are guilty of ' flagrant abuses of aviation workers ' labour rights '			1
the worst offender , according to @entity6 , is @entity14 - which employs over 31,000 people and is the world 's tenth largest airline with a modern fleet of over 100 aircraft			1
the policies for female workers in the skies at two @entity3 - based airlines have caused controversy according to @entity6 , @entity14 currently operates a draconian hiring policy insisting : last year the airline was attacked by @entity28 's anti-discrimination ombudsman after it told women attending a recruitment day in @entity31 to wear short skirts			1
according to @entity6 , former crew members have claimed that in the past female staff have been fired for posting pictures of themselves in bathing suits or exposing tattoos on their @entity39 pages			1
another female crew member was allegedly dismissed after management received a report that she had ' kissed a man at a @entity45 nightclub '			1
but perhaps most shocking is an interview published last year by the @entity49 newspaper @entity48 in which a @entity14 pilot reportedly states how the ceo tries to keep female crew members from mixing with male pilots by making remarks such as : ' the pilots are my chauffeurs , they only come to you to f * * * you '			1
@entity59 also has reported policy that women who fall pregnant in their first three years of work must leave their role @entity3 - based @entity14 are accused of abusing the rights of their female cabin staff @entity59 has defended its policies stating that female workers are expected to fly in the first three years of their contract @entity69 , @entity14 senior vice president @entity70 , insisted it was untrue that cabin staff had to ask permission to get married			1
he said : ' as has been stated before , @entity14 flight attendants do not have to be , or remain single			1
' many of our cabin crew are in fact married			1
the employment contracts simply use the term " single status " which is a common term in many @entity3 companies ' contracts			1
in addition , cabin crew do not have to ask permission before marrying			2
@entity14 ' chief executive @entity88 has defended the carrier 's hiring policy ' like many other airlines , for health and safety reasons and as mandated by the @entity94 , cabin crew do have to notify us when they become pregnant			1
' @entity97 in @entity8 , as in other @entity99 countries , are licensed professionals , and must therefore comply with civil aviation regulations in order to maintain a valid cabin attendant licence and a cabin attendant medical certificate			1
' @entity97 who can not fly , due to pregnancy , or who for any other reason are unable to maintain their licence , are assisted with finding suitable ground positions			2
' @entity14 is not the only @entity3 - based airline which stands accused of discriminating against their female workers			1
@entity114 - based @entity9 - one of two flag carriers of the @entity9 - is currently operating a policy whereby female cabin crew who become pregnant in the first three years have to leave			1
in a statement made last year chief commercial officer @entity118 defended his airline 's policy			2
he said : ' if you are hired by @entity9 as a cabin crew , during the first three years we expect from you to fly			1
' @entity125 has contacted @entity9 for comment			0
@entity127 , civil aviation secretary at the international grouping of transport unions , said : ' the treatment of workers at @entity14 goes further than cultural differences			0
' they are the worst for women 's rights among airlines			2
' the policies have been compared to those used by the first big @entity139 airlines in the 1960s			2
@entity144 for example specified attendants must be unmarried , a minimum of 5ft 2ins , weigh no more than 130 pounds , have no children and had to retire at the age of 32			2
however campaigns by the group stewardesses for women 's rights during the 1970s brought in new laws			0
the age restriction was eliminated in 1970 and the restriction of hiring women only was lifted in 1971			0
however it took until the 1980s to eliminate the no - marriage rule and weight restrictions were still being enforced in the 1990s			0
mr @entity127 added : ' you ca n't see that deep level of sexism anywhere now except at these airlines in the @entity3			2
' the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) has claimed @entity14 is an organisation ' with a secret to hide ' accusing it of subjecting its workforce to a regime of curfews , surveillance and constant fear of sacking and even arrest			0
the @entity6 claims many of the firm 's cabin staff have reached out to them for help complaining of a ' climate of fear '			0
they have provided the following account which they say comes from a @entity14 cabin crew member describing what life is like at the airline			2
' the phrase that time and time again its workers reach for when talking to us is that they live in ' a climate of fear '			0
a @entity187 cabin crew member explains : ' all the cabin crew live in company accommodations and can not move out			0
' there are cameras in every building and security guard watching everything you do , and the only way to go in or out of your accommodation is by swiping your id card otherwise the doors wo n't open , this way they can keep track of the exact times when you leave or come in			0
' i believed this is very dangerous specially in case of a fire or something			0
there 's a housing department , and they randomly have spotchecks in your apartment , if you have alcohol , cigarettes , pork products , or anything that is not allow by them you are sacked immediately			0
' also you have a curfew to be back in your accommodation every single day since the first day you arrive … this includes on your days off , meaning you can ever stay outside			0
' many people get sacked daily … for reasons you will never believe			0
the biggest problem is there are no workers rights in this country so there 's nowhere to complain , if you do n't like anything you simply get sacked and if that happens before completing 2 years with the company you have to pay a bond which many can not afford			0
' and the only way to leave the country is by the company authorizing an exit permit , so you are basically trapped , many employees who have been in trouble for stupid reasons and are suspended from flying are trapped in @entity45 for even months with no salary waiting for clearance by the airline , payment of your bond etc. ' nobody knows what to expect until they arrive here they do n't mention this things during the recruitment process			0

@entity8 airlines demands attendants ask permission before getting married
flight attendants must be single and remain so for at least five years
they are required to notify the airline immediately if they fall pregnant
flight attendants must ask permission before getting married
female flight attendants can only be hired if they *'re* single
they must remain single for at least five years after starting work
female flight attendants must notify the airline immediately if they fall pregnant
pregnancy can be considered a breach of contract and can lead to firing
