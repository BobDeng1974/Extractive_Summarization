by @entity0 when a media team devised a social experiment asking the @entity5 public to support their campaign to kill poor people , they expected much more of a backlash			1
but far from being disgusted , they found that some were more than willing to support the cause after taking their bogus appeal far too literally			2
wearing a billboard declaring ' kill the poor ' , actor @entity13 took to the streets of @entity16 , a wealthy district of @entity17 , to gauge the public 's reaction			1
' two other men appear unmoved when mr @entity13 details how they can donate to the fake organisation and then they would ' kill them ( poor people )			2
' he also struggles to gain the attention of two police officers , who do no more than ask him politely to leave without taking any further action			1
this was even after mr @entity13 explained to them how the group would use poor people 's body parts to their advantage			0
supportive : another member of the public appears to side with the campaign by admitting the idea was ' really good ' , although it 's not clear whether he was thought it was either a metaphor or tongue - in - cheek political statement : when mr @entity13 explains to the man that he is trying to spread the message , he replies that ' @entity75 has been doing this for 40 - 60 years ' money for ' murder ' : mr @entity13 explains to these two gentlemen how his fake organisation works law and disorder : mr @entity13 tries to grab the attention of a police officer by handing him a leaflet @entity86 , the ceo of media company @entity87 , which devised the experiment , told @entity89 : ' the purpose of this social experiment was to test whether citizens of @entity5 had genuine concern and care for the poor			1
' we knew that people would react strongly if our actor became a human billboard asking people to " @entity101 "			0
' but to our surprise a lot of people did n't seem to be appalled by the idea of an organisation trying to kill the poor			2
' instead , some of them even agreed with us and gave us ideas to execute our social experiment			0
' nonplussed : police officers listen in as mr @entity13 explains how his fake group can use poor people 's body parts told to move on : police officers ask mr @entity13 to leave the area , but take no other action over his campaign people do care : this man was among the few citizens who took issue with the experiment , swearing at mr @entity13 and accusing of him of being ' mad ' some do , however , take issue with mr @entity13 , with one man swearing at him and calling him ' mad '			1
later in the video , he swaps his ' kill the poor ' billboard for one saying ' help the poor ' while rattling a tin to test the public 's reaction to a more positive appeal			1
but the team found that only one person donated any money			0
mr @entity86 said : ' we were in for a big surprise when people reacted insensitively to killing the poor and did n't even donate when we asked them to help the poor			0
role reversal : later in the video , @entity13 swaps his ' kill the poor ' billboard for one saying ' help the poor ' while rattling a tin to test the public 's reaction to a more positive appeal ' hypocritical of the public ' : the team found that only this man donated any money to the ' @entity145 ' appeal ' this was , in a way , extremely hypocritical of the general public of our nation			1
' the campaign was similar to that carried out by a charity on the streets of @entity164 last month			0
it featured a member of the @entity167 , which helps the most vulnerable in society , wearing a sandwich saying : ' f * * * the poor '			0
the charity found that while @entity170 did care about the plight of the poor , they were n't likely to stop to help .			0
