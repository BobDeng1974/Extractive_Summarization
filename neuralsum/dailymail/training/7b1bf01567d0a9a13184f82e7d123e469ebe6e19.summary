by @entity0 last updated at 2:56 am on 10th december 2011 selling smart cars - the tiny @entity2 ' microcars ' popular in @entity3 has always been a tough job in the @entity6 so @entity7 is set to unveil the first smart pickup concept - titled the @entity7 for - @entity6 it will celebrate what @entity7 calls ' its world premiere ' at the @entity12 in @entity13 , 14 - 22 january 2012			1
the new smart car is a pickup truck aimed squarely at the @entity6 market - armed with an electric - bike charging station on the back , and a smartphone instead of a rear - view mirror @entity7 says the concept is so small it could actually be loaded into the loading area of a normal @entity6 pickup truck			1
it 's just 12 feet long and 5ft high - and it wears its hi - tech heart on its sleeve			2
in place of a conventional rear - view mirror the smart for - us features a smartphone accommodated in a holder on top of the instrument panel support			1
the driver can see what is happening on the road behind with the help of an integrated video camera			0
two e-bikes will sit in the back , and the loading area is all - electric too - though whether the vehicle 's 12ft length will appeal to @entity6 remains to be seen it 's also unlikely to match the roar of the average pickup truck - it has a state - of - the - art electric drive with a55 kw magneto - electric motor the zero - emission smart for - us is agile and lively to drive			1
smart ceo dr. @entity52 says ' we at smart love pick - ups â€“ if they are small on the outside , large on the inside , very safe and extremely comfortable			0
with the smart for - us a petrol station is no longer required ! ' obviously , plenty of power sockets will be.not only does the two - seater run entirely electrically , it also sports a docking station for two e-bikes , and you charge them up as it drives - so you can jump off for yet more environmentally friendly transport once you park up			0
naturally , the cargo area is all - electric , too			2
' when it opens first of all the cargo floor including tailboard retracts by one foot , then the tailgate slides down in a parallel position			0
the cargo on the 3ft cargo area is then extremely easy to access , ' says @entity52 .			0

@entity2 pickup truck will be all - electric and just 12ft long
@entity77 boast it can fit in the cargo *bay* of a normal pickup truck
