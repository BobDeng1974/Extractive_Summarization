all though allergies to foods like nuts are increasing , mr @entity0 's death is one of around ten each year in @entity23			1
his case has led to a major purge by trading standards officers targeting a food fraud in which peanuts are used in place of more costly almonds			1
most curry lovers are unable to taste the difference unless they suffer from a nut allergy - in which case the results can be fatal			1

' in 2011 another @entity7 restaurant , the @entity98 in @entity99 , had to pay Â£ 6,000 in fines and costs after a diner was rushed to hospital after she suffered a serious allergic reaction to milk in her curry - having already warned it made her ill. last year a landscape gardener with a nut allergy died after eating a curry			1
@entity113 was eating his chicken tikka while watching the @entity115 then he started coughing uncontrollably and his lips turned blue			1
he told friend @entity118 : 's * * * , i 'm allergic to nuts ' before he collapsed and died			2
nuts can trigger some of the most severe allergic reactions , although it 's not clear why nut allergy is the most common type of severe food allergy			2
it it is an umbrella term for an allergy to both peanuts ( which , strictly speaking , are not nuts but legumes , belonging to the same family as peas and beans ) and tree nuts , such as walnuts , hazelnuts , almonds , cashews , pecans , brazils and pistachios			0
like many other foods , nuts can act as allergens , but for reasons that are n't clear , they cause some of the most severe reactions			0
in the @entity23 , about 1 in 100 people have an allergy to peanuts and about 1 in 200 people have an allergy to tree nuts			0
the number of people with peanut allergy is growing			0
people who have other allergic conditions in their family - such as hay fever , asthma and eczema - are more likely to suffer nut allergy			2
most people with nut allergy react after contact with small amounts ( less than one nut ) and some people may react to trace amounts , the website patient.co.uk reports			0
this means some people do n't even have to eat an actual nut to have a reaction			0
a minority of people are so sensitive to nut allergens that a tiny amount on their lips - or even standing next to someone eating peanuts - can trigger a reaction			2
when someone comes into contact with something they are allergic to ( an allergen ) , a group of cells in the body - mast cells - release a substance called histamine			0
histamine causes the tiny blood vessels in the tissues of the body to leak fluid , which in turn causes the tissues to swell			0
this results in a number of different symptoms			0
signs of a mild allergic reaction include : * @entity206 mouth and lips * facial swelling and / or a feeling of tightness around the throat * feeling sick , stomach pains * a rash or hives signs of a severe reaction include ( in addition to the above ) : * @entity218 or difficulty breathing due to an asthma - like attack , or throat swelling * @entity223 - or low blood pressure which can cause fainting or collapse * redness of the skin , due to dilation of the blood vessels a severe reaction is known as anaphylaxis			1
without immediate treatment , victims soon become unconscious			0
a small number die every year due to this type of severe reaction , typically because they do not receive treatment quickly enough			0

@entity0 , 38 , was found dead after the curry caused an allergic reaction
takeaway owner , @entity17 , is accused of manslaughter
he will appear in court tomorrow in @entity23 *landmark* legal case
the case led to a purge by trading standards officers targeting food fraud
