@entity1 ’s rumoured smartwatch wo n't need a phone to work - and now patent images have revealed it may not even need a touchscreen			1
according to the application filed by the @entity8 firm , the standalone smartwatch could be controlled using gestures , detected by sensors built into the wrist - worn device			1
these sensors could recognise flicks , waves and other movements , and the files claim a depth sensor , when combined with a camera , for example , could be used to detect what a user is pointing at			1
according to patent images , pictured , @entity1 's standalone smartwatch may include sensors that detect flicks , hand waves , fists and other movements			1
the files claim a depth sensor , when combined with a camera , for example , could be used to detect what a user is pointing at , or interacting with , for example @entity1 could be on the verge of entering the virtual reality race , if reports about an upcoming headset are true			1
the @entity8 firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to test , and the final product could launch by the end of the year			0
sources close to @entity1 told @entity44 the headsets have oled screens and will connect with the next generation of @entity49 devices			0
the reports suggest the headset will run on @entity52 , rather than the @entity54 operating system most recently seen on @entity1 ’s latest smartwatches			0
while orientation sensors could be used to unlock the device with a flick of the wrist or open certain apps			1
elsewhere , ambient sounds picked up by the watch ’s built - in microphone could add context to a gesture - for example , if using the watch at a gig , a gesture that traditionally switches on the camera could , instead , switch to video mode			0
‘ a depth sensor may be used in conjunction with an optical camera to enhance display or detection of a device 's environment , or to determine which object a user is pointing at or interacting with via a gesture , ’ explained the patent			1
‘ sensors may include one or more inertial sensors or orientation sensors , such as an accelerometer , a gyroscope , a magnetometer , a gps chip , or a compass			2
the g watch is likely to sync with @entity92 's current range of phones			0
earlier this week , patent files revealed a @entity1 smartwatch , pictured , that wo n't need a phone to work			0
according to the application , the standalone smartwatch could be controlled using gestures , detected by sensors built into the wrist - worn device @entity1 already has four smartwatches on the market , including the @entity105 , pictured left , powered by @entity108 's @entity52 operating system , and the @entity109 , pictured right , powered by @entity54			1
it is unclear which operating system the standalone smartwatch will run on ‘ in particular embodiments , output from sensors may be used to activate or unlock a device , detect one or more gestures , interact with content on the device 's display screen or a paired device 's display screen			1
‘ sensors may include one or more microphones for detecting speech of a user , or ambient sounds to determine the context of the device			0
’ a number of existing @entity1 products , including the @entity130 , already feature gesture controls , that let users scroll using hand waves , and sensors that follow where the user is looking			0
its upcoming smartwatch could develop these further			0
the patent said sensors could be used to activate or unlock a device , detect one or more gestures , interact with content on the screen , or a paired device 's screen			2
a number of existing @entity1 products , including the @entity130 , already feature gesture controls and its upcoming smartwatch could develop these further the @entity147 is one of a handful of devices , including the @entity151 , pictured , to take advantage of the modified @entity52 software			0
the @entity155 watch is expected to launch shortly after @entity92 's g watch the images are part of a wider patent revealed earlier this week that suggest @entity1 is developing a smartwatch that does n’t need a phone to work			2
the firm plans to unveil the smartwatch over the next few months in a bid to take a larger slice of the wearable technology market			0
the unnamed smartwatch will be able to take photos , send emails , monitor the wearer ’s heart rate and use gps tracking , according to sources close to the company			1
@entity1 has declined to say what the device will be called , how much it will cost or whether a user will make calls by holding the watch close to his or her mouth			2
the patent suggests @entity1 's new smartwatch will have a round face resembling @entity155 's @entity186 - powered @entity151 .			2

patent images reveal sensors placed on the wrist - worn device
a depth sensor used with a camera could detect what a user is pointing at
orientation sensors could be used to unlock it with a flick of the wrist
the unnamed smartwatch could be launched over the next few months
as well as sending calls and texts , the wearable device is expected to take photos , send emails , monitor the wearer ’s heart rate and use gps tracking
device will be the first standalone smartwatch from a major *manufacturer*
@entity1 's rival , @entity217 , could launch its own smartwatch later this year
