by @entity1 reporter published : 12:17 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 12:54 est , 17 september 2012 @entity2 today vowed down to track down the filmmaker who produced an @entity5 film which has provoked protests around the world			1
as fresh protests broke out in @entity10 and @entity11 , the @entity2 vice-president @entity8 issued an stark message directed at @entity13 - who lives in @entity14 - who was behind @entity15			1
' the government of the @entity17 of @entity2 condemns ... this inappropriate and offensive action , ' mr @entity8 said			2
' certainly it will search for , track and pursue this guilty person who ... has insulted 1.5billion @entity21 worldwide			0
' anger : protesters in @entity11 torch a @entity26 flag during a demonstration against the anti-islam film @entity29 in the city of @entity31 @entity2 's supreme leader @entity32 also issued a statement , calling on the @entity34 to show it respects @entity36 by blocking the film			1
they must prove they were not ' accomplices ' in a ' big crime ' , he said			0
the comments came on the day that : the demonstrations were the latest across the world ignited by a short film made with private funds in the @entity26 and posted on the internet that depicted the @entity49 as a fool , a womaniser and a homosexual			2
the situation saddles @entity26 president @entity54 with an unexpected foreign policy headache as he campaigns for re-election in november , even though his administration has condemned the film as reprehensible and disgusting			2
condemnation : @entity2 vice-president @entity8 ( left ) called for the makers of the film to be punished while the country 's supreme leader @entity32 ( right ) demanded the @entity34 take action in a torrent of violence last week , the @entity26 ambassador to @entity66 and three other @entity26 were killed in an attack in @entity70 and @entity26 and other foreign embassies were stormed in cities in @entity73 , @entity74 and the @entity75 by furious @entity21			1
at least nine other people have been killed			0
@entity77 has sent ships , extra troops and special forces to protect @entity26 interests and citizens in the @entity75 , while a number of its embassies have evacuated staff and are on high alert for trouble			1
a @entity90 spokesman said @entity54 spoke by telephone to senior diplomats at the weekend to reassure them of his support			0
' he called the chiefs of mission in @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity66 and @entity99 to let those diplomats know that he was thinking about them , that their safety remains a top priority of his , and it is something he will remain focused on , ' spokesman @entity94 said			0
despite @entity54 's efforts early in his tenure to improve relations with the @entity110 and @entity36 world , the new violence adds to a host of problems including the continued @entity26 military involvement in @entity10 , @entity2 's nuclear programme , the @entity116 civil war and the fall - out from the @entity119 revolts			1
earlier the leader of the militatn group @entity121 sheik @entity122 called for protests against the movie and said the @entity26 must be held accountable for the film			1
fury of the mob : hundreds of protesters - some of them very young - targeted @entity26 base @entity129 in @entity130 shouting ' @entity131 ' strong tactics : dozens of @entity10 policemen were deployed in an attempt to restore order ' those who should be held accountable , punished , prosecuted and boycotted are those directly responsible for this film and those who stand behind them and those who support and protect them , primarily the @entity26 , ' mr @entity122 said			1
he called for protests on monday , wednesday , friday , saturday and sunday , urging protesters to call on their leaders to express their anger too			2
' we should not only express our anger at an @entity26 embassy here or there			0
we should tell our rulers in the @entity110 and @entity36 world that it is " your responsibility in the first place " and since you officially represent the governments and states of the @entity36 world you should impose on the @entity26 , @entity159 and the whole world that our prophet , our @entity162 and our holy places and honor of our @entity49 be respected , ' he said			1
a 14 - minute excerpt of the film , which is both in @entity167 and dubbed into @entity168 , has been available on @entity169 , although some countries have cut access to the site			1
the violence began tuesday when mainly @entity175 protesters climbed the @entity26 embassy walls in the @entity178 capital of @entity179 and tore down the @entity26 flag from a pole in the courtyard			1
@entity183 , the @entity26 ambassador to @entity66 , also was killed tuesday along with three other @entity26 , as violent protesters stormed the consulate in @entity70			2
volatile : @entity98 activists stage a protest outside the @entity189 mosque in @entity190 , in support of a hardline muslim , known as @entity193 who is holed up inside reactionary : the hardliner had called for supporters to protest against the @entity26 embassy president @entity54 has vowed that the attackers would be brought to justice but also stressed that the @entity26 respects religious freedom			1
the president 's response was echoed by former prime minister @entity205 , who called into @entity207 's @entity206 monday morning to discuss the continued violence			2
mr @entity205 , now @entity75 envoy for the quartet of powers , said : ' the film , it may be wrong and offensive but it is also laughable as a piece of film - making			1
' what i am afraid is very dangerous and actually is wrong is the reaction to it			0
' mr @entity205 said such problems were an inevitable consequence of the @entity119 that has overthrown repressive regimes in @entity66 and elsewhere			0
' i just see a region that is in the process of huge transition			0
there is essentially a struggle between the forces of modernisation , who want an open society , a properly functioning economy , who recognise the 21st century is the 21st century , and then those of reaction based on a perverted view of religion , that want to pull the whole thing backwards , ' he said			0
' when you lift the lid off the repression what comes out are a whole lot of religious , ethnic , tribal influences that themselves have to be countered and moulded into something that is compatible with the modern world			0
' rally : hundreds of protesters clad in white hurled petrol bombs outside the @entity252 in @entity253 , @entity254 ugly scenes : @entity26 flags were also burned in the streets as police fired tear gas in a bid to disperse the crowds out of control : the protests were the first in @entity254 since a firestorm of protests had spread across the @entity36 world mr @entity205 said he had changed his view since his time in @entity270 , when he used to avoid discussions about faith			1
' what the politicians often want to do - for totally understandable reasons , i used to feel this myself - is religion is such a tricky subject for us that we want to stay away from it , ' he said			0
' but one element of resolving this is about a view of religion that is also open - minded and pluralistic			0
' and what you actually require for democracy to function properly is a view of democracy in which religion has its place but where you have democracy - friendly religion as well as religion - friendly democracy			0
' he added : ' in the end we need both the leadership within those countries and within @entity36 to stand up and say ‘ look , there is a proper modern way of reconciling religious faith , democracy in society ’ , and we need ourselves from the outside to engage with this process of change in a way that ’s constructive			2
