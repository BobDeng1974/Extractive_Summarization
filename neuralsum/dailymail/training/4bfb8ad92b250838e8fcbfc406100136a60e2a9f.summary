a university student has been sacked from his campus job for allegedly taking a naked photo of a female student when her eyes were closed during sex			1
the woman did not know the man had taken the photo - or that he had shown it to other students at the @entity11 - until six months later			1
he eventually wrote in an apology letter to her , published by student newspaper @entity14 : ' i took a photo of us in a state of undress without your knowledge or consent ... after i found the photograph , i showed it to other students that we both know			1
' she believed the private letter was not enough and has battled to have the second - year student publicly reprimanded since earlier this year			1
the @entity11 have taken action against a student who took a naked photo of another student and shared it among friends at the university only now has the university ’s vice-chancellor , @entity36 , decided that the 20 - year - old will be forced to leave his role as a @entity40 , the @entity41 has revealed			1

‘ at that meeting @entity56 undertook to investigate the responsibilities of the @entity60 position			0
the position is unpaid and does not involve pastoral care but requires a high standard of personal conduct and behaviour to be maintained at all times			0
’ the university ’s handling of sexual harassment complaints are continuing to be discussed according to the university			0
when the existence of the photos was first revealed the university organised for the male and female student to meet after he apologised with the private written letter			2
however , the female did not think this was enough and wanted a public apology			2
‘ justice done in the dark ca n’t be seen to be justice , ’ she told the @entity41			0
' i had to fight to get student affairs to consider it a breach of misconduct and investigate my claim			0
it took months to process it ( from january to august ) , ' the woman told @entity14			0
@entity91 has contacted the @entity11 's student union for comment			0

the 20 - year - old student allegedly took the photo when the female 's eyes were closed , without her knowledge
he then shared it with other students at the @entity11
the woman did *n't* know about it until more than six months later
the male student wrote a private letter of apology
but the female fought to have a public apology and *punishment*
the university finally removed him from his campus job this week
