@entity0 insists @entity1 will remain an attractive destination for the game ’s top players even when they lose one of their biggest stars			1
@entity1 ’s manager was determined to move on this thursday by drawing a line under the story of @entity10 leaving , stressing it was time ‘ to concentrate on football ’ when asked about his captain ’s revelation that he would have stayed had a contract been offered last summer			1
what @entity0 did recognise , however , is that 34 - year - old ’s move to @entity19 leaves a void on and off the pitch			1
one ramification is that he will never be able to use the line ‘ come and play with @entity10 ’ again when making a big sales pitch			1
@entity0 believes @entity1 is still an attractive proposition for the top players @entity10 's departure to @entity19 was confirmed on wednesday and he will join in july @entity27 ( right ) is in line to replace @entity10 as @entity1 captain next season @entity0 , though , is refusing to lose heart and he maintains @entity1 have a duty to be competing at the top end of the market			1
‘ we have to have confidence that in the time i have been here , there have been some outstanding players who have come , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but there is no doubt we need to replace that quality , either through some young players getting an opportunity or our players stepping up to the mark			1
‘ but ( it is ) also ( about ) bringing in that quality			0
@entity49 will tell on that			0
it has been difficult and over the last couple of years , some of our top players have gone out			0
no one knows that more than me			0
the likes of @entity57 leaving and @entity58 going in the first year			0
@entity59 ( left ) controls the ball during training at @entity62 on thursday morning @entity0 is keen to draw a line under @entity10 's summer departure and push for a top - four finish ‘ they were fantastic players			1
@entity10 is going to move on			1
i want to work with that level of player			0
as a coach and manager , i enjoy working equally with the stars and the world - class talent as i do with young players so i am not purely one who needs to work with young players			0
‘ if you speak with the elite and world - class players , they will say they enjoyed working with me			0
but for us it is something that needs to be done			0
this is @entity1 - we have to be in the running for the world ’s best			2
’ yet even with @entity10 , @entity1 have found it difficult to woo big names and in the last two years , for one reason or another , they have missed out on @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			1
they struggle to complete deals but @entity0 says @entity1 ’s name still appeals			1
‘ we have to believe it can be done , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ last season after nearly winning the league and playing a game that excited people , we were in a great position to attract a level of player			0
the team has changed but the great name of @entity1 is still the same			2
@entity59 and @entity106 ( left ) share a joke at the training session on friday @entity109 touched down at @entity110 on thursday ( right ) after posting a selfie while flying ‘ it is still a big attraction for players			2
hopefully we can still keep moving forward and come the end of the season , we will be in the @entity117 having won something as well			1
you have to keep working to find the players who ’ll make you the best you can be			0
’ one positive for @entity0 is that he should soon be able to call on @entity109 again			1
the @entity123 international has returned from undergoing intensive rehabilitation in the @entity125 and it is hoped he will be available ‘ towards the end of january ’			2
‘ we have to trust the work he has done , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ it has been very good and when he comes back he hopefully sustains his fitness			0
’ meanwhile , dr @entity132 , @entity1 ’s first - team doctor since 2010 has left his post abruptly			0
no reason has been given for his departure .			0

@entity1 have missed out on a number of targets in recent seasons
@entity0 says @entity1 need to replace the quality of @entity10
the @entity1 boss is still hoping to secure @entity117 football
