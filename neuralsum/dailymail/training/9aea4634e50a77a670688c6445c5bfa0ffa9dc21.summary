by @entity0 strange underwater rings spied in shallow water off the coast of @entity4 are caused by poison – and not aliens or fairies , biologists have said			1
a holidaying journalist took a photo of the mysterious ' fairy rings ' in the clear water off the @entity13 , leading people to speculate about the cause of the underwater fairy rings			1
the rings are formed of vivid green eelgrass and measure up to 49ft ( 15m ) wide and their shape is created by toxins in the water			1
strange underwater rings ( pictured ) spied in shallow water off the coast of @entity4 are caused by poison and not aliens or fairies , biologists have said			1
the rings are formed of eelgrass and measure up to 49ft ( 15m ) wide the rings are eelgrass and measure up to 49ft ( 15m ) wide			1
studying the mud surrounding the bizarre rings , @entity4 biologists discovered high levels of sulphide , which is poisonous to the grass			2
the plants trap the toxic soil so that there is a high concentration around them			0
the rings form because of the circular pattern in which eelgrass naturally grows and the toxin killing off older , weaker plants			1
younger eelgrass plants seem to be better at withstanding the toxin than the older plants at the centre of a circular colony , which die and leave a ‘ hole ’ so that the plants look like rings			2
the result is an exceptional circular shape , where only the rim of the circle survives			0
@entity4 biologists have confirmed that the circles have ‘ nothing to do with either bomb craters or landing marks for aliens ’			2
@entity59 from the @entity60 and @entity61 from the @entity62 also ruled out fairies , ‘ who in the old days got the blame for similar phenomena on land , ’ they said			0
instead , they believe the rings form because of the circular pattern in which eelgrass naturally grows and the toxin killing off older , weaker plants , according to the journal @entity75			1
studying the mud surrounding the bizarre rings , they discovered high levels of sulphide , which is poisonous to the grass and can gradually build up on a chalky seabed , just like @entity83 ’s			0
the toxin can also occur if agricultural pollutants leak into the water , @entity84 reported			0
scientists believe that the rings form because of the circular pattern in which vivid green eelgrass ( pictured ) naturally grows and the toxin killing off older , weaker plants ‘ most mud gets washed away from the barren , chalky seabed , but like trees trap soil on an exposed hillside , eelgrass plants trap the mud and therefore there will be a high concentration of sulphide - rich mud among the eelgrass plants , ’ the biologists said			1
while the grass might look a little like some types of seaweed , it is a flowering plant that expands outwards to create circular colonies when it grows			2

@entity59 and @entity61 said : ‘ the result is an exceptional circular shape , where only the rim of the circle survives - like fairy rings in a lawn			0
’ the investigation into the underwater rings started when journalist @entity124 took a photo of them on a private trip at the cliffs of @entity83 and afterwards wrote an article for regional publication @entity130 , which spread though @entity4 ’s tv channels and newspapers			2
some fairy rings on land have been blamed on fungus , but others have baffled scientists , such as those found in the grasslands of @entity141			0
hungry ants , seeping gas and competition for resources have all been blamed for the markings there .			0

a holidaying journalist took a photo of the *previously* mysterious phenomena in the clear water off the @entity13 , @entity4
the rings are formed of eelgrass and measure up to 49ft ( 15m ) wide
biologists said the ring shapes are created because of the circular pattern in which the grass grows - and dies when it is exposed to toxins
