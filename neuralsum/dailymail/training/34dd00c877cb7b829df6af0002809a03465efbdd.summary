think you ca n’t have lunch for under a fiver ? we ’re here to tell you that you can			0
but it will mean changing some lunchtime habits			0
you will need to steer clear of popular options such as @entity7 , @entity8 , eat and @entity9 and start going to supermarkets for your sarnie , salad and snack			0
and while an @entity15 sandwich or a @entity17 salad might not be the most glamorous of lunches , you could end up saving between £ 2 to £ 5 a day , depending on your food choices			1
while they may have some enticing options salad bars and hot lunch counters can often ending costing a lot while we all love hearty office lunch , the cost of a daily takeaway can be crippling while we all love hearty office lunch , the cost of a daily takeaway can be crippling			2
the combined cost of a sandwich , drink and a snack from popular lunchtime outlets can often come up to more than £ 6 a day			2
for instance a @entity7 lunch of a chicken and avocado sandwich ( £ 3.25 ) with a bottle of pomegranate and hibiscus still water ( £ 1.65 ) and a slice of banana cake ( £ 1.60 ) comes up to £ 6.50 , which when multiplied by five ( assuming you work monday to friday ) will cost you a whopping £ 32.50 a working week			2
compare that to the cost of an @entity48 lunch of a chicken , chilli and mango salsa sandwich with coconut pieces and orange juice , which comes up to £ 5 , or £ 25 per working week and the price disparity is obvious			1
and while you 're losing the pounds from your purse , you may well be piling them elsewhere as a lot of these options are high calorie foods			0
@entity7 's 482 - calorie sandwich also loses out when pitted against @entity48 's , which contains a mere 295 calories			2
@entity48 's £ 5 a day lunch includes a sandwich , coconut pieces and freshly squeezed orange juice bargain : @entity15 's chicken and wholewheat pasta , savoury popcorn and cranberry drink costs just £ 3.69 hot food counters like the ones at @entity8 are also guilty of making us overspend			1
the pay - by - the pound pricing structure can be misleading and there are times when you can end up paying as much as £ 20 or a salad or hot lunch just because you were n't paying attention to what you were putting in your takeaway bowl			2
supermarkets may not have the most exotic of choices but their prices are far more appealing			0
the @entity48 @entity87 and @entity88 costs just £ 2.50			2
bored of sandwiches ? splash out an extra 50p and go for the @entity90			0
snacks include the 50p @entity93 & @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , and @entity97 , both £ 1 or the £ 1.20 fruit selection of melon , pineapple and grapes			0
add a bottle of @entity104 ( £ 1.50 ) or @entity105 ( £ 1 ) and your meal will cost you exactly £ 5			1
looking to make bigger lunchtime saving ? try @entity15 ’s super salads			0
lunch on either @entity111 and @entity112 , ( 153cal ) ; @entity113 and @entity114 ( 305cal ) or @entity115 and @entity116 ( 164cal ) , all from their good and @entity118 range and you wo n’t be spending any more than £ 2			1
and as you ’ve only spent £ 2 on salad , you can afford a snack of either walnuts and dates , crinkle cut crisps , popcorn or lentil chips , all which cost £ 1			1
add a drink ( 69p ) and you ’ll still be hard pushed to spend more than £ 4 here			0
@entity17 's £ 3 meal deal options include tuna and cucumber sandwiches on malted bread ( left ) and the 2 for £ 2 sushi combinations such as their veggie taster ( right ) have @entity15 's baby potato and free range egg salad ( left ) for lunch and snack on lentil chips as a treat ( right ) @entity17 is another great option			1
there are a number of healthy combinations within the supermarke'ts £ 3 sandwich meal deal which means you get a choice of any sandwich or salad , snack and drink for £ 3			0
