by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 2 august 2013 @entity2 : 06:24 est , 2 august 2013 two hero bin men today told how they rescued a terrified woman and her dog from a sinking car - after she drove off a 20ft harbour wall and plunged into the sea			1
@entity9 , 35 , and @entity10 , 43 , were eating their lunch at @entity13 harbour in @entity14 when they heard a loud revving noise followed by a massive splash			1
the duo fled to the water 's edge to find the shocked woman and her dog trapped in a brand new @entity21			1
sunk : the vehicle flew into the water after a woman drove off a 20ft wall and plunged into the sea mystery : it is not yet clear what happened to lead to the red @entity30 flying into the sea , but thankfully there were no injuries while @entity9 ran for some ropes , @entity10 swam into the harbour with a mystery @entity37 cyclist who said he was a lifeguard and freed the panicking woman , thought to be in her 50s , from the stricken vehicle			1
@entity9 , of @entity42 , recalled the bizarre incident which happened 12.20pm on thursday afternoon			1
he said : ' we were at the harbour having our lunch			1
we saw a person sitting in the car and we thought she was taking in the view , which is not unusual			0
' but suddenly there was an almighty revving sound and the car shot into the water			1
' @entity10 ran down the slipway and began swimming out to the car , while the @entity37 man , who would only give his name as @entity60 , stripped off and dived 20ft off the pier into the water			1
with the car being washed out to sea and already submerged in water as deep as 12ft , the men had to act quickly			1
brave lads : @entity9 , left , and @entity10 , right , beside @entity13 harbour where they saved a woman driver and her dog @entity10 , 43 , of nearby @entity71 , said : ' @entity9 took his boots off , but i went straight in with all my gear on			1
' i noticed there was a woman in the front seat holding a dog			2
' i 'd just reached the car when this @entity37 guy got the woman out of the driver 's seat			2
' as he was pulling her to safety he shouted out that there was still a dog in the back of the car			2
' at this stage the car was sinking and i did n't think i 'd be able to open the door because of the water pressure , but i just about managed it			1
' a collie dog clambered out , but then it started swimming the wrong way out into the harbour			2
' it was panicking and snarling at me , so after pushing it round the right way i decided to just let it make its own way back			0
' dragged out : the emergency services inspect the sunk car as it is pulled from @entity105 @entity9 added : ' the woman was probably aged in her 50s			1
' after she was brought out of the water , she started going on about how she had valuables in the car , so the @entity37 guy went back into the water			2
' the car was completely submerged by then , but he dived down and managed to bring a couple of items back , including the dog 's pillow			2
' the woman was quite shaken and shivering			0
she seemed to be suffering from shock			0
' the whole incident was a scary thing to be involved in			0
' we did n't think about it at the time , but afterwards you realise just what a close thing it had been			0
' @entity10 said : ' it was a close shave , if it had n't been for that other guy jumping in and helping , who knows what would have happened ? ' the lady was very lucky			2
' local resident @entity131 said she thinks the woman accidentally drove off the edge of the pier			0
she said : ' it 's all a bit bizarre , but thankfully she 's ok			0
' she seems to have just been sitting there looking out to sea and then somehow managed to press the accelerator by mistake and drove into the sea			0
' she definitely did n't mean to do it as she said she had a lot of valuables and money in the car			0
' the woman was taken to @entity148 in @entity149 for a check - up but is not thought to have suffered any serious injuries			0
police and an ambulance went to the scene , as did the village 's coastguard , who winched the woman 's @entity21 - which became completely submerged at one point - up the slipway and out of the water			0
it is thought that the woman 's dog is recovering in a local boarding kennel .			0
