@entity1 's new left - wing prime minister has declared war on the country ’s all - inclusive resorts , which are visited by thousands of @entity6 families every year			1
all - you - can - eat buffets and unlimited drinks by the pool are under threat even though that sector of tourism brings in £ 1.5billion a year for the @entity1 economy			1
@entity15 , leader of the triumphant anti-austerity party @entity16 , believes such deals ‘ alienate tourists from the local economy ’ by keeping them in resorts and away from small businesses			1
deals to sell public land to mega-resort developers could be banned and vat rules are likely to be changed to hit existing holiday developments with higher taxes			0
mr @entity15 said : ‘ we do not want to continue the current saturated model of intensive exploitation of tourism			1
’ the new regime says it does not support an outright ban , but wants to encourage a move away from the all - inclusive resorts back to the traditional holiday model where visitors use local bars , restaurants and attractions			2
@entity60 , the @entity16 mp responsible for the party ’s tourism policy , told the @entity63 : ‘ for the all - inclusive , our view , as well as that of the tourism industry , is that it ’s not the best thing			1
’ there are hundreds of all - inclusive hotels on the @entity1 islands and on the mainland in resorts such as @entity72 in @entity73 and @entity74 in @entity75			1
deals : holiday - makers can go all - inclusive at the @entity78 in @entity73 , but prices could become unaffordable they are popular with families on a budget who know that once they have paid , they will not face extra bills for meals , drinks and entertainment			1
but they are a disaster for local traders and restaurant owners because holidaymakers tend to stay behind the fences of the resorts			0
@entity6 tour operators have long - standing contracts with all - inclusive resorts , meaning any changes to the tax regime in @entity1 would be unlikely to affect visitors this year			1
@entity101 said : ‘ the change in government has no impact on our operations in @entity1			1
as a tour operator , we are there to support our customers , who can be confident they can book their holidays to @entity1 with us without any concern			2
’ tourist chiefs in both @entity6 and @entity1 oppose any tax changes that will put up the cost of visiting the country ’s resorts			1

his appointment by far - left prime minister @entity15 will be seen as a signal that the new government will not back down over its demands to slash the country ’s crippling debt repayments			1
mr @entity122 , an academic who has held teaching positions in @entity6 , says repayment of @entity1 ’s £ 185billion international bailout should be linked to growth			1
in practice , this would mean nothing is repaid until the economy recovers			0
the left - wing @entity16 party won a shock general election victory on sunday after pledging to renegotiate the bailout deal and write off more than of half the debt			0
mr @entity15 has formed a coalition with the anti-austerity party @entity158			2
@entity131 leaders have reacted with alarm to @entity16 ’s victory , with @entity162 warning @entity1 it must pay its debts			1
@entity164 warned the result would ‘ increase economic uncertainty across @entity134 ’			0
@entity167 , of the think - tank @entity168 , said of @entity16 : ‘ proving that their theories can be applied to the current political and economic reality will be a tough test			0
’ prime minister @entity15 believes such all - inclusive deals ' alienate tourists from the local economy ' by keeping them behind resort gates and away from businesses and attractions the @entity181 said this would drive holidaymakers to other @entity185 countries			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the @entity1 government will have to consider the impact of any restrictions			2
‘ all - inclusive holidays continue to grow in popularity , particularly amongst the family market			0
the @entity1 should consider that they might risk losing this slice of the holiday market to other countries such as @entity196 and @entity197			2
' even though all - inclusives can be seen as a controversial option , there are pros and cons and many all - inclusives are a vital source of employment for local people , both directly and indirectly			2
’ any changes made by the new government will not affect the cost of package holidays that are currently being advertised by @entity6 tour operators as the contracts and prices have already been agreed			2

the @entity232 said tour operators were hoping the new government acts responsibly			2
@entity6 director @entity234 said : ‘ everyone is acutely aware of the important role tourism plays in the @entity1 economy and all @entity1 governments have always approached tourism policies with respect , which is what we expect the new government to do once it has formed			1

incoming prime minister @entity15 is regarded as a true man of the people , a world away from @entity1 's political elite which has been characterised by corruption			1
with the help of his youthful good looks and down - to - earth nature ( he happily takes out the rubbish ) , he has swept to power on a promise to smash the @entity131 's grip on the country 's finances			0
