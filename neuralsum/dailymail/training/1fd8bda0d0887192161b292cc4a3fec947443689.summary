by @entity0 in what was one of the closest presidential races in @entity6 history , it was a public relations gamble that may well have tipped the balance - had it ever been shown			0
but this video for @entity9 's 1976 election campaign against @entity10 was shelved because it was deemed to shocking to air to a country still fragile from @entity13 's assassination , @entity14 and the @entity15			1
in the five - minute clip , @entity9 , who survived two assassination attempts himself , is seen giving a speech when a cherry bomb goes off			1
believing it was a gun shot , he flinches - but then calmly continues with barely a quiver in his voice			0
at that point , a narrator says : ' neither the cherry bombs of a misguided prankster nor all the memories of recent years can keep people and their president apart			0
' when a limousine can parade openly through the streets of @entity40 , there 's a change that 's come over @entity6			2
' @entity9 's media team hoped it would emphasise that the incumbent had indeed healed an embattled country in the two years since taking office			1
' emotionally powerful ' : the video then cuts to a scene showing @entity9 riding in an open - top car through @entity40 , just as @entity13 had done when he was shot dead in the city 13 years previously motorcade : president @entity13 and @entity66 governor @entity65 ride through @entity40 moments before @entity13 was assassinated but when it was shown to a focus group , it became apparent that it had gone too far			1
recalling the viewing , pollster @entity70 later recalled that ' it was shocking to them '			0
' it was just too emotional ...			0
some in @entity9 's inner circle feared the subject matter was still too raw for the @entity6 people and that it would particularly harm the campaign in @entity66			2
as it turned out , @entity9 lost to @entity81 @entity10 , who secured 50.1 per cent of the vote to his 48 per cent			1
presidential historian @entity83 noted on @entity84 , that with such tight margins , the video had the potential to swing the result the other way			2
he said : ' i found it emotionally powerful			0
i think it would have been even more affecting , had it aired as planned , in that national atmosphere 13 years after president @entity13 's murder and in the immediate wake of @entity6 's traumas over @entity14 , urban riots , campus demonstrations and @entity15			2
near miss : @entity9 is surrounded by his security team immediately after the first of two assassination attempts made against him during his president would - be assassin : @entity108 disciple @entity107 is arrested after pointing a loaded gun at the president			1
she was jailed for life in 1975 for trying to kill the 38th @entity6 president with a colt 45 - caliber pistol ' especially since it advertises a president not known for his emotional appeal , the commercial does an impressive job of presenting , on an emotional level , the best case for @entity9 's election - that he had healed a ravaged country			1
' he adds that it ' might conceivably ( along with so many other factors ) have changed the result of that year 's presidential race '			0
as vice-president , @entity9 found himself thrust into the presidential office in 1974 after the resignation of @entity130 over the @entity15			1
he had been charged with restoring trust in the government , which many feel he succeeded in doing			0
at the @entity9 's funeral in 2007 , former president @entity134 said : ' in president @entity9 , the world saw the best of @entity6 and @entity6 found a man whose character and leadership would bring calm and healing to one of the most divisive moments in our nation 's history			1
' but six months after taking office , @entity9 pardoned @entity130 for his part in the cover - up of the burglary at @entity153 in the @entity154 - a move some believe ultimately cost him the 1976 election			0
@entity9 died on @entity157 in 2006 at the age of 93 .			0

clip shows @entity9 flinching when cherry bomb goes off during speech
then cuts to him riding in a car through @entity40 , just as @entity13 had done
his media team believed it would show how he had healed the nation
but focus group found it ' just frightening ' so soon after assassination
historian believes it may have changed result of defeat to @entity10
