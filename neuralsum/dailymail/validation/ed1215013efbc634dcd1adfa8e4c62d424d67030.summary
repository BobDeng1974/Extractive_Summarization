for centuries there have been accounts of animals behaving bizarrely before earthquakes			2
now , for the first time , scientists have filmed the behaviour of wild animals prior to a quake and believe their study could help improve short - term seismic forecasting			1
they found that animals in @entity11 - such as pumas and razor - billed curassow birds - ran for cover days before the event			1
researchers believe that the changes in behaviour may be linked to airborne ions			1
this still shows a razor - billed curassow led by dr @entity28 of @entity29 , experts used data gathered from a series of motion - triggered cameras located in the @entity33 in @entity11			1
the research found that significant changes in animal behaviour began 23 days before the magnitude 7.0 @entity39 earthquake that struck the region in 2011			1
on a typical day , the cameras would record between five and 15 animal sightings			2
however , within the 2 - day period in the run - up to the earthquake , they recorded five or fewer sightings			1
for five of the seven days immediately before the earthquake , no animal movements were recorded at all , which was incredibly unusual for the mountainous rainforest region			1
dr @entity50 , a lecturer in animal and environmental biology , told @entity53 that rodents seemed to be particularly sensitive and disappeared completely eight days before the quake			1
‘ usually they ’re quite ubiquitous in the forest			0
they ’re very common and were everywhere in the control period , but then completely disappeared			0
’ the research found that significant changes in animal behaviour began 23 days before the magnitude 7.0 @entity39 earthquake struck the region in 2011			1
a stock image showing rupture caused by a quake is shown scientists recorded the reflection of very low frequency radio waves above the area surrounding the epicentre of the @entity11 earthquake			1
in particualr they monitored the ionosphere , the layer of the @entity78 's atmosphere which contains a high concentration of ions and free electrons and is able to reflect radio waves			2
it is thought that positive airborne ions , which are known to be generated in large numbers at the @entity78 ’s surface when rocks deep below are subjected to increasing stresses during the build - up to an earthquake , trigger unusual animal behaviour			1
positive ions in the air lead to unpleasant side effects in animals and humans , such as ‘ serotonin syndrome ’			1
this is caused by an increase in the serotonin levels in the bloodstream , and can lead to symptoms such as restlessness , agitation , hyperactivity and confusion			2
the study which was co-authored by professor @entity108 of the @entity109 and professor @entity110 of the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) in @entity112 , and is published by the journal @entity114 of the @entity78 , looked at reasons for this disappearance			2
they recorded the reflection of very low frequency ( @entity120 ) radio waves above the area surrounding the epicentre			2
the scientists detected disturbances in the ionosphere - the layer of the earth 's atmosphere which contains a high concentration of ions and free electrons and is able to reflect radio waves - which started two weeks before the earthquake			1
a particularly large fluctuation was recorded eight days prior to the quake , coinciding with the second significant decrease in animal activity observed in the pre-earthquake period			1
prominent among the most likely causes for the unusual animal response are positive airborne ions , which are known to be generated in large numbers at the @entity78 ’s surface when rocks deep below are subjected to increasing stresses during the build - up to an earthquake			1
positive ions in the air lead to unpleasant side effects in animals and humans , such as ‘ serotonin syndrome ’			1
this is caused by an increase in the serotonin levels in the bloodstream , and can lead to symptoms such as restlessness , agitation , hyperactivity and confusion			2
they expected the injection of positive airborne ions into the @entity78 ’s atmosphere before seismic activity to have a profound effect on mammals and birds - in particular those living on the ground and in burrows , and the study seems to prove this			1
dr @entity50 , a lecturer in animal and environmental biology , told @entity53 that rodents seemed to be particularly sensitive and disappeared completely eight days before the quake			1
this still from an in - situ camera shows a @entity181 rodent during the control period of the experiment experts led by dr @entity28 of @entity29 used data gathered from a series of motion - triggered cameras located in the @entity33 in @entity11 ( marked on the map ) ‘ as far as we know , this is the first time that motion triggered cameras have documented this phenomenon prior to an earthquake , ’ dr @entity50 said			1
‘ the results are particularly interesting as we also found evidence of disturbances in the ionosphere in the area where the earthquake struck			1
‘ we believe that both of these anomalies arise from a single cause : seismic activity causing stress build - up in the earth ’s crust , leading , among other things , to massive air ionisation			2
professor @entity108 of the @entity109 , who works at @entity212 ’s @entity211 in @entity213 , added : ‘ the camera traps were located on a ridge at an altitude of 900 metres			0
‘ if air ionisation occurred , it is likely that it was particularly strong along such a ridge			2
‘ hence , the animals would have escaped to the valley below , where they were exposed to fewer positive airborne ions			1
prominent among the most likely causes for the unusual animal response are positive airborne ions , which are known to be generated in large numbers at the @entity78 ’s surface when rocks deep below are subjected to increasing stresses during the build - up to an earthquake			1
a puma is captured in this image before the quake ‘ with their acute ability to sense their environment , animals can help us understand subtle changes that occur before major earthquakes , ' said professor @entity108 of the @entity109			2
this aerial view shows the tectonic uplift along a fault in @entity244 ‘ with their acute ability to sense their environment , animals can help us understand subtle changes that occur before major earthquakes			2
‘ these changes , that we are now able to measure , express themselves in many different ways at the earth ’s surface and above			0
’ dr @entity50 said that that next step in the research is to find a reproducible way of monitoring behavioural changes before an earthquake , because ‘ we do n’t want a false alarm ’			0
she intends to investigate wither zooplankton – tiny animals that live in water – could be used as a biological indicator for seismic activity			0
‘ we hope our work will stimulate further research into this area , which has the potential to help with short - term seismic risk forecasting , ’ she added			0
as well as predicting earthquakes , animals could help repair the damage they cause too			0
in november last year , researchers at @entity272 fitted cockroaches with electrical ' backpacks ' complete with tiny microphones to detect the faintest of sounds			0
the idea is that cyborg cockroaches , or ‘ biobots ’ , could enter crumpled buildings hit by earthquakes , for example , and help emergency workers find survivors			0
‘ in a collapsed building , sound is the best way to find survivors , ’ said @entity285 , an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university			0
‘ the goal is to use the biobots with high - resolution microphones to differentiate between sounds that matter - like people calling for help - from sounds that do n't matter - like a leaking pipe			0
rise of the robo - roach : scientists have developed technology that allows cyborg cockroaches , or biobots ( pictured ) to pick up sounds with small microphones and seek out the source of the sound			0
they could one day be used in emergency situations to detect survivors ‘ once we 've identified sounds that matter , we can use the biobots equipped with microphone arrays to zero - in on where those sounds are coming from			0
’ the ‘ backpacks ’ control the robo - roach 's movements because they are wired to the insect ’s cerci - sensory organs that cockroaches usually use to feel if their abdomens brush against something			0
by electrically stimulating the cerci , cockroaches can be prompted to move in a certain direction			0
in fact , they have been programmed to seek out sound			0
one type of ' backpack ' is equipped with an array of three directional microphones to detect the direction of the sound and steer the biobot in the right direction towards it			0
another type is fitted with a single microphone to capture sound from any direction , which can be wirelessly transmitted - perhaps in the future to emergency workers			0
they ‘ worked well ’ in lab tests and the experts have developed technology that can be used as an ‘ invisible fence ’ to keep the biobots in a certain area such as a disaster area , the researchers announced at the @entity343 2014 conference in @entity344 , @entity345			0
a previous study led by dr @entity354 , who is also at the university , showed that biobots can be used to map a disaster area			0
dr @entity354 and professor @entity285 plan on merging their research to both map disaster areas and pinpoint survivors .			0

scientists filmed the behaviour of animals in @entity11 before an earthquake
found many fled to lower ground and holed up days before the event
for five days before the earthquake , no animal movements were recorded
expert from @entity29 said rodents are extra sensitive
study *suggests* animals respond to disturbances in the ionosphere
positive ions in the air lead to *disagreeable* side effects in animals
