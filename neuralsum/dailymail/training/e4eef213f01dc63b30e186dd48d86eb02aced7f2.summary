his only means of communication is via a computer triggered by blinks and head movements			0
mr @entity8 has been battling for two years to persuade three judges at the @entity38 to rule that if , and when , he decides he wants to die , doctors will be immune from prosecution if they help him			1
yesterday they gave him the devastating news that only @entity43 can change the law of murder so that doctors or helpers can step in to assist someone to die			1
harrowing : the pain clear to see , @entity8 breaks down in tears today after being told that he will not be granted the right to die mr @entity8 today vowed to appeal the decision , despite the ' physical discomfort , misery and mental anguish ' this will bring him and his family heartache : mr @entity8 cries at the computer he uses to speak through			1
he was once an active man but has become incapable of even basic tasks after his stroke the judges said that if no doctor was allowed to help mr @entity8 die , then his only option would be to die by starvation			1

speaking through his computer , mr @entity8 said : ‘ i am devastated by the court ’s decision			0
‘ although i did n’t want to raise my hopes , it happened anyway because a fantastic amount of work went into my case and i thought that if the court saw me as i am , utterly miserable with my life , powerless to do anything about it because of my disability , then the judges would accept my reasoning that i do not want to carry on and should be able to have a dignified death			1
‘ i am saddened that the law wants to condemn me to a life of increasing indignity and misery			0
’ @entity8 , ' locked - in syndrome ' sufferer at home in @entity23 , @entity24 , and right , with daughter @entity73 in 1989 supportive : mr @entity8 's wife @entity9 ( centre ) and daughters @entity73 ( left ) and @entity72 ( right ) at the @entity38 in @entity101 at an earlier hearing mrs @entity103 , 56 , said : ‘ @entity104 has to either carry on like this until he dies of natural causes or starves himself			1
’ right - to - life campaigners said the ruling would protect the vulnerable from pressure to commit suicide or from involuntary euthanasia			1
mr @entity8 ’s case was a joint one with a 47 - year - old known only as @entity116 because his family wishes to preserve their privacy			1
he suffered a stroke four years ago and is unable to speak or move , except for small movements of his head and eyes			1

he said their plight was ‘ deeply moving ’ , but added : ‘ their desire to have control over the ending of their lives demands the most careful and sympathetic consideration , but there are also other important issues to consider			2
' a decision to allow their claims would have consequences far beyond the present cases			0
‘ it is not for the court to decide whether the law about assisted dying should be changed and , if so , what safeguards should be put in place			0
‘ under our system of government these are matters for @entity43 to decide , representing society as a whole , after parliamentary scrutiny , and not for the court on the facts of an individual case or cases			2
’ the judge said mr @entity8 ‘ wants to be able to choose to end his life by voluntary euthanasia			1
’ ‘ this does not mean that he necessarily wants to end his life immediately			0
' at the moment he thinks that he would probably wish to end it in a year or two , but he wants to establish the right to die with dignity at a time of his choosing ’			2

however , @entity116 ’s wife , a nurse , was unwilling to help him die			2
' his options under current law are either to travel to the @entity224 clinic in @entity225 to get help with suicide , or to starve himself			0
mrs @entity103 said her husband was reluctant to go to the @entity224 clinic			0
‘ we could do @entity231 but it ’s very expensive and he does n’t see why the hell he should have to go to a foreign country to die in the middle of an industrial estate , ’ she said			2
right - to - life campaigner dr @entity236 of the @entity238 said the ruling ‘ confirms the simple truth that the current law exists to protect those without a voice : the disabled , terminally ill and elderly , who might otherwise feel pressured into ending their lives			2
’ he added : ‘ it confirms the view that even in a free democratic society there are limits to choice			0
every law limits choice and stops some people doing what they might desperately wish to do , but this is necessary in order to protect others , especially the most vulnerable in our society			0
‘ hopefully the decision to reject both cases will now draw a line once and for all under legal debate and allow decision - makers and society to focus attention on how we care for the terminally ill and severely disabled			2
