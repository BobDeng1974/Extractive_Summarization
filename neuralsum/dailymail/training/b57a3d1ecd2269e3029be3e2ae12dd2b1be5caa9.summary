officials at the software giant and the @entity10 collaborated to get around the company ’s own encryption programmes , according to documents seen by the @entity15 newspaper			2
the paperwork , provided by whistleblower @entity17 , apparently demonstrates the level of co-operation between @entity20 and the intelligence services over the past three years			1
co-operation : @entity1 liased with @entity3 intelligence agencies so that they could spy on unsuspected people 's emails , according to documents seen by @entity15 they show that @entity1 helped the @entity10 intercept web chats and e-mail addresses including @entity5 and outlook accounts			1
they also reveal the company worked with the @entity31 to allow the @entity10 easier access via the @entity33 to the cloud storage system @entity34 , which has more than 250million users			2
and in july last year , nine months after @entity1 bought @entity7 , the @entity10 boasted that ‘ a new capability ’ had allowed it to triple the amount of @entity7 video calls collected through @entity33			0
material collected through @entity33 is routinely shared both with the @entity31 and @entity42 and one @entity10 document even described the program as a ‘ team sport ’			0
listening in : as well as emails , the documents suggest that @entity1 liased with intelligence services so that they could monitor @entity7 conversations the revelations expose the extent of tensions between major tech firms in @entity20 and the @entity55 administration			1
the firms want to be allowed to speak openly about how much they co-operate with the @entity10 in order to placate their customers ’ concerns over privacy			0
in private , they insist the access given to the @entity3 intelligence agencies is not one of collaboration but is driven by legal compulsion			0
@entity70 : the documents were provided to @entity15 by @entity10 whistleblower @entity17 @entity1 said : ‘ when we upgrade or update products we are n’t absolved from the need to comply with existing or future lawful demands			1
’ but the company maintains it provides customer data ‘ only in response to government demands and we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers			0
’ since @entity33 's existence became public , @entity1 and other technology giants denied any knowledge of the programme			0
but although @entity1 launched an advertising campaign and @entity7 has a privacy policy which both trumpet the companies privacy policies , secret internal @entity10 newsletters suggest that the companies co-operated with the intelligence community , @entity15 reports .			2
