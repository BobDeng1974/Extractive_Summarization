@entity19 wasteland : the crowds have disappeared from @entity2 - and so has the grass groundsmen use specialist @entity24 machinery to strip away the grass and prepare the soil for the new seed every inch of the courts is painstakingly tended to by a team led by @entity13 the famously green court looked barren as work was carried out to replace the grass the court was constantly tended throughout the championships but showed some wear by the time @entity3 won the men 's singles final as well hand - weeding , rolling and mowing the grass to 8mm every day during a tournament , staff also have to replace the grass every summer			1
