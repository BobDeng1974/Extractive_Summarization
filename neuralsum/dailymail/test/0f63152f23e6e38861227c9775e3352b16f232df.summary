@entity0 hailed the bravery of his @entity3 players after they ruined @entity6 ’ @entity5 title party with a 2 - 0 derby win			1
he saw his men hold on to second place in the @entity10 with a second straight win , building momentum after a run of three consecutive defeats – and setting them up for saturday ’s @entity16 semi-final against @entity18			1
@entity0 , who had seen his team play well but fail to beat @entity6 in three previous outings this season , said his players had answered those who asked if they had the bottle to win at the business end of the season			1
‘ two weeks ago we were being questioned , ’ said @entity0 after goals from @entity28 and @entity29 saw them remain level on points with @entity32 , who have a game in hand			1
‘ people were asking if this was the wobble and was this @entity3 ; season ending again			1
@entity0 saw his side record a win in the @entity42 derby to put @entity6 ' promotion party on hold ‘ @entity45 can change very quickly			1
suddenly after two results we are building momentum again			0
i think the players have always answered the criticism			0
‘ when you have played well against the champions , as we have done this season , and not got three points , i think it is important			2
‘ sometimes it can just linger on and it puts self - doubt in not just the players ’ minds but the fans ’ minds as well			2
i was proud of the players today , i really was			0
they were courageous and brave so i am delighted for them			0
’ @entity0 singled out @entity65 for special praise			1
the striker – not long back from seven months out with an achilles injury – played brilliantly before securing victory with his injury - time finish			1
‘ i ’m absolutely delighted for him , ’ said the @entity3 manager			1
‘ he has had a really tough seven months , with a horrendous injury			2
i do n’t think people understood just how bad the injury was and the fact he is back playing now is all credit to him			1
@entity6 captain @entity81 picks the ball out of the back of the net after his side concede a second goal ‘ the surgeon deserves praise for the procedure he did and it ’s great to have him back , because he is something we have missed			1
i think @entity29 is only going to get better , he is still not where we would like him to be			2
he needs more strength and speed put into him , but he will get that by playing games and working on his programme			0
’ @entity3 defender @entity98 admitted he ’d been motivated by a desire to silence the gloating @entity6 fans , saying : ‘ as much as you try and block out what the @entity6 fans are planning , you see it on social media and in the papers			2
you know the fans are doing this and that			0
‘ you ’d be lying if you said you do n’t hear the fans during the game			0
i like a bit of banter because it ’s the fans ’ day as well as the players			0
you can use it to your motivation , as long as you do n’t let it affect your game in a negative way			0
‘ it ’s all a bit of fun			0
they have won the league - but we get the bragging rights for today			2
the @entity3 fans were in good spirits at full - time after getting one over their city rivals ‘ it ’s probably the most important derby win i ’ve been involved in			1
my debut was special and i ’ll always remember it but it was vital to get three points and keep the pressure on @entity32			0
‘ all we can do is keep winning games until the end of the season and see where it takes us			2
they ( @entity32 ) go to @entity147 at the end of the season and if we win all our games we need them to drop points somewhere			0
if we stay focused it could be a really good season for the club and the fans			0

@entity3 won the derby 2 - 0 to stay second in the @entity10
they had lost their last three , but the win gives them momentum
