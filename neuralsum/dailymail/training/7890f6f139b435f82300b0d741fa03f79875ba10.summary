the clever design by @entity8 designer @entity7 , named ' @entity9 ' brings a cartoon touch to the standard couch , leaving exercise avoiders with little excuse			1
while resting , the sofa 's arm and punch bag lies flat on the seat , but it can be moved in to position ready for action within seconds			1
' it should just be a casual thing , something on demand			2
then the idea to combine it with a backrest for the sofa sprang to mind			2
' i wanted it to be comic - like , fresh and with a poppy appearance , and the shape just ended up that way			0

he considers each sofa a work of art , so each one is individually handmade , and retails at around £ 3,000 ( 3,600euros )			1
