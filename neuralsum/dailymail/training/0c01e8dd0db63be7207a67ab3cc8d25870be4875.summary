by @entity0 , education correspondent the return of the traditional a-level was heralded yesterday in figures showing a surge in teenagers choosing to study history , geography , languages and maths			1
advance data issued ahead of a-level results next month shows that rising numbers of new entrants to sixth - forms are opting for core academic disciplines			2
the number of 17 - year - olds taking geography has shot up 17 per cent while demand for history has leapt 14 per cent			1
@entity21 may have demoted @entity22 from his job as education secretary but his legacy is pupils taking ' serious ' a levels the resurgence of traditional subjects follows the introduction of new - style school league tables aimed at promoting disciplines seen as valuable by universities and employers			1
schools were previously able to score well in the tables without entering pupils for many traditional academic gcses , prompting some to favour ‘ mickey mouse ’ courses to rack up points			1
but former education secretary @entity22 brought in a new ‘ @entity42 ’ ( @entity42 ) which rewards schools for entering pupils for six core gcses - @entity45 , maths , two sciences , a language and history or geography			1
the impact of the initiative on a-level choices is being seen for the first time , according to figures from the @entity57 , representing exam boards			0
@entity22 brought in a new ‘ @entity42 ’ ( @entity42 ) which rewards schools for entering pupils for six core gcses - @entity45 , maths , two sciences , a language and history or geograph the number of pupils taking as - levels – which are halfway towards a full a-level – in history rose 14 per cent from 71,669 in 2013 to 81,843 this summer , while entrants for @entity70 geography went up 17 per cent to 55,958 and @entity71 15 per cent to 14,089			1
maths saw an increase of 7.1 per cent in entries and physics 4.5 per cent , with smaller rises in @entity77 and @entity78			0
the @entity57 said the trends may be partly down to changes to exams this year including the cancellation of the a-level resit opportunity in january , which is thought to have led to more candidates retaking in june instead			0
but it added : ‘ despite this , the dramatic increases in some subjects compared with others point to a large number of candidates sitting the subjects for the first time			2
’ it went on : ‘ of particular interest in these data is the significant increase in @entity70 entries for geography , history and @entity71 ( 16.9 per cent ; 14.2 per cent ; 14.8 per cent )			1
‘ @entity77 and @entity78 entries also increased with @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity71 combined rising 6.1 per cent and all modern foreign languages rising 5.6 per cent			0
the number of pupils taking as - levels – which are halfway towards a full a-level – in history rose 14 per cent from 71,669 in 2013 to 81,843 this summer ‘ in fact , @entity70 entries for all @entity42 subjects have increased			1
’ the @entity57 said it believed the figures ‘ point to the @entity42 influencing student and centre [ school and college ] choices ’			1
choices at as - level usually have a strong bearing on the subjects taken to full a-level , with most pupils carrying on with their as - level subjects			2
figures for entries to full a-level this summer – before the ‘ @entity42 effect ’ has worked its way through - show modest increases in the numbers taking maths , further maths , chemistry , physics and geography			1
professor @entity132 , director of the @entity133 at @entity134 , said that while the trends were positive , the figures have been rising from a very low base			0
in physics , a-level entrants had slumped to 27,368 in 2006 and although demand had now recovered to 36,862 , it was still far below levels of 30 years ago			0
‘ in 1982 , there were around 55,700 sitting physics			0
so although there has been a recovery , it has to be seen against that background , ’ he said			0
the figures were released amid major changes to the exam system including a crackdown on resits and the return of end - of - course exams			0
the exam watchdog @entity157 last month wrote to head teachers warning them of ‘ more variability ’ in results in 2014 compared with previous years because of this year ’s reforms			1
@entity157 warned that pupils ‘ who have not had the opportunity to re-sit will generally do less well ’			1
while headline results will be kept broadly in line with previous years , results at individual schools will vary more widely than usual			0
this year ’s results day is thursday august 14			2
among trends already emerging are a drop in the number of pupils collecting a-level results in @entity45 this summer			2
numbers are down 4.4 per cent , from 90,007 in 2013 to 86,036			0
it follows a grading fiasco at gcse level two years ago which stemmed from a redesign of gcses by the last @entity182 administration			0
it broke courses down into modules and allowed teachers to mark large chunks of them through so - called ‘ controlled assessment ’			1
but over-generous marking by teachers led to grade boundaries in @entity45 having to be raised at the last minute			0
after a @entity193 challenge brought by an alliance of pupils , schools and councils , judges ruled that pupils were treated unfairly but that @entity157 and the exam boards did not act unlawfully			2
@entity200 , the deputy general secretary of the @entity201 , said : ‘ there ’s quite clearly some indication of an unexpected drop in entries to a-level @entity45 , which of course coincides with the issues in 2012 to do with gcse results in @entity45			0
‘ it looks as if @entity45 entries have gone back up again for as - level in 2014 , which would indicate that there was a drop in those taking @entity45 , which would in all probability be linked to what happened in 2012			2
‘ although a great deal was made at the time of the effect of the @entity222 grade boundary , it also impacted across the grade range			0
’ the figures also showed a decline of 2.4 per cent in the total number of a-levels taken this year despite a small rise in the population of 18 - year - olds and an upturn in university applications			1
the @entity57 said it had so far only analysed ‘ high level ’ data and could not say whether the trend was down to teenagers opting instead for alternative qualifications such as the @entity238 or simply taking fewer a-levels .			2

number of 17 - year - olds taking geography has shot up 17 **%** while demand for history has leapt 14 **%**
