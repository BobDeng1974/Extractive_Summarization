not to be outdone by @entity2 leaping off a cliff , adrenaline junkie @entity0 can add wing - walking to his nerve - jangling offseason exploits			1
last year the @entity6 linebacker hiked in @entity7 for five days , swam with sharks in @entity9 and boarded down - and crashed on - an active @entity11 volcano			0
but the 28 - year - old hit new heights in a biplane , leaving the cockpit to clamber along the aircraft before the pilot spins the plane 180 degrees at approximately 3,500 feet			0
@entity0 was one of the success stories of last season and contributed to the @entity6 ' fearsome defense not satisifed with that , the daredevil displayed pictures on his @entity26 account of him sat on top of the plane in a harness			1
@entity0 has documented his adventurous experiences on @entity26 , saying : ' not ready for the offseason yet , but last year 's included riding horses in exotic locales , hiking and sleeping atop a dark cold mountain for two nights , volcanic craters , sledding down an active volcano , cockfights , and saving a woman from a rushing river , ' three months ago			2
and the thrill - seeker can now add walking in the @entity43 to his antics			0
after last year 's win over @entity46 , @entity0 and the @entity6 will once again travel to @entity47 ahead of their game with the @entity50 at @entity51 on november 1 .			2

@entity0 headed to @entity53 , @entity54 , to *undergo* a wing - walking class
the daredevil took to the *skies* on a biplane and is shown walking along the wing before being spun around in the air
@entity0 also *posted* pictures on his @entity26 account of him say on top of the plane
he led linebackers with six *interceptions* in 2013 and led the @entity71 last season with *117* solo tackles
his *current* deal runs out at the end of the season and *signing* him up will be a *priority* to the @entity6 front office
