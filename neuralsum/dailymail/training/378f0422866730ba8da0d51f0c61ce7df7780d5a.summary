ask @entity0 who the next @entity2 manager should be and he will tell you that the search should start and end with @entity6			1
nearly 16 years have passed since @entity6 ’s last game as @entity2 ’s head coach , a 2 - 0 win over the @entity10 at @entity11 in a friendly in november 1998			1
on tuesday the pair were reunited when @entity6 accepted a bolt - from - the - blue offer to become @entity16 ’s first team coach at @entity17			1
bolt from the blue : @entity6 accepted the offer to become @entity16 's first - team coach at @entity17 @entity16 wants to play the in - vogue 3 - 5 - 2 formation , casting @entity0 in the role of sweeper and using @entity23 and @entity24 to stabilise his defence			1
if it works - and safety in the @entity29 will be the measure of its success - then you can expect some momentum for @entity6 ’s return to the national team			2
football really is that fickle			0
this is a fascinating appointment because @entity6 - as a man and as a manager - divides opinion			1
he is not an easy man to get along with			0
his last coaching appointment was in 2004 , an unsuccessful spell at @entity43 that lasted less than two years			2
he has been off the training field a long time now			0
‘ the game has moved on since the last time @entity6 was a manager , ’ was @entity46 response to @entity6 ’s criticism of his @entity49 team from the television studio last season			1
they have never seen eye - to - eye , a legacy from @entity6 ’s spell as @entity49 manager when @entity46 ’s playing days were coming to an end			1
@entity46 is not alone in his assessment			0
with the national team , @entity6 made some catastrophic decisions as head coach			2
one of them , over his comments about the after - life , led to his resignation in february 1999			0
those with even deeper memories will recall his book - @entity6 : my @entity72 story - spilling the guts on @entity2 ’s dressing room secrets at @entity76 98			1
as a result , he lost the trust of his players			0
believer : @entity0 thinks @entity6 should be @entity2 boss , as he was here in 1998 highs and lows : @entity6 after @entity2 drew 0 - 0 in @entity84 in 1997 ( left ) and his final match vs the @entity10 @entity86 1991 - 1993 played 115 won 49 @entity87 @entity88 1993 - 1996 p 157 w 53 d 54 l 50 @entity2 1996 - 1999 p 28 w 17 d 6 l 5 @entity89 2000 - 2001 p 52 w 22 d 12 l 18 42.31 @entity49 2001 - 2003 p 104 w 41 d 18 l 45 @entity43 2004 - 2006 p 76 w 27 d 34 l 15 more recently @entity90 , who is now @entity2 ’s assistant manager , questioned his methods and ability to manage a dressing room in his own autobiography , red			1
according to @entity90 , @entity2 ’s head coach used to touch players on the heart in the dressing room before matches and asked the backroom team to walk around the pitch ‘ anti-clockwise ’ when they played @entity103 at @entity76 98 to create positive energy			1
@entity90 , though , does go on to say that @entity6 ‘ undoubtedly ’ wanted @entity2 to play the right way but questioned whether that he had ‘ the man - management skills to go with his football intelligence ’			1
society demands a second chance , an opportunity to rectify mistakes from the past			0
this , unquestionably , is @entity6 ’s			2
@entity0 , who played in @entity6 ’s last game as @entity2 ’s head coach , believes he possesses one of the finest tactical minds in the game			1
long spell out : @entity6 has not coached in @entity121 football since his tenure at @entity43 ended in 2006 that is a select grouping , one that includes some coaching greats such as @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			2
the former @entity131 defender , who played and trained under @entity132 , @entity130 , @entity130 , @entity130 and @entity133 with the national team , is convinced @entity6 belongs in the elite category			2
on the training field , @entity0 will tell you that @entity6 has an eye for detail and the intuition to solve problems before his players have even seen them			1
if true , that is a unique skill			0
in the @entity146 era , we are witnessing a massive change in the landscape of @entity121 football			0
there is endless talk about tactics , systems and team shape now that the fabled @entity155 coach has arrived at @entity131 with his salt and pepper pots			0
sweeping statement : @entity0 will be the ' libero ' at @entity17 , as @entity6 ( right ) was at @entity86 new era : @entity146 is using the same 3 - 5 - 2 formation @entity6 and @entity16 will attempt to implement at @entity17 it is there , at @entity163 , where @entity146 intends to play a variation of 3 - 5 - 2 this season			1
@entity16 wants to do the same			2
@entity6 did n’t reinvent the wheel when he became manager of @entity86 in 1991 , his first coaching appointment , but it was certainly brave to play with a libero in the old @entity171			1
he put himself there , the launchpad for @entity86 ’s attacks as they progressed to the play - off final , where he scored the opening goal in a 4 - 3 victory over @entity179 , in his second full season			2
@entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and former @entity49 midfielder @entity184 , who came on as a substitute at @entity11 , were in the victorious @entity86 team			0
he went on to sign the great @entity187 in 1995 when manager of @entity88 , converting the former @entity189 forward into a libero , with mixed results , towards the end of his career			0
it is 21 years since he started work at @entity88 ’s old @entity197 training centre after succeeding @entity198 as their manager			0
now he is returning to work there , this time as @entity17 ’s first team coach as he attempts to rebuild his career at the very highest level			0
at the age of 56 there is time for @entity6 to make an impression and fulfil the ambition he once showed as a promising young coach			0
if it works out , it will only be a matter of time before he becomes an option for the national team .			0

@entity6 has joined the coaching staff at @entity17
@entity16 is considering employing 3 - 5 - 2 tactics at @entity218
@entity0 will be a sweeper with @entity23 and @entity24 ahead
former @entity2 manager has not been involved in coaching since 2004
@entity225 claims the game has moved on since @entity6 was last around
@entity90 questioned @entity6 's management skills in his autobiography
@entity0 ranks the former @entity49 boss as a tactical genius
