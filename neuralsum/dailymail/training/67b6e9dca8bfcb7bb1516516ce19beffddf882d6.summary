by @entity0 published : 14:32 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 03:23 est , 5 december 2012 a cocker spaniel puppy was able to go walkies for the first time after becoming the youngest dog in the @entity5 to undergo a full hip replacement			1
captured in mid-flight , @entity7 looks like the happiest of puppies running himself ragged on walkies			1
but the ten - month - old cocker spaniel is only just getting into his stride after a rare degenerative disease left him unable to stand or walk – until now			1
@entity7 was suffering from @entity26 , thought to be caused by poor blood supply to the ball of the thighbone			1
the illness had wasted away his back legs , leaving him in agony			2
the risky £ 6,000 operation , usually carried out on dogs twice his age , was paid for by his owners ’ insurance			0
vets feared that unless he underwent the procedure he would have to be put down because it was in too much agony			0
but now since undergoing the operation at just five - and - a - half months old , the cocker spaniel is enjoying a new lease of life and is able to go for a walk and run properly for the first time in its life			1
@entity7 is now looking for a new home after his owners were no longer able to care for him			1
@entity48 , owner of @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 , where @entity7 is staying , said : ‘ he ’s like a bottle of pop. considering what he ’s gone through it takes some believing			2
’ ' miserable ' : @entity7 , left , was unable to use its hind legs properly and would drag itself around using its front paws , but now the pooch is racing around at top speed ( right ) thanks to a hip replacement operation @entity66 , of @entity67 , @entity51 , said the risky procedure is normally only performed on fully - grown dogs			1
she said : ' he was really miserable , he would whimper a lot , he became very very thin and weak on his back legs because he just was n’t using them			0
' he would walk or rather drag himself round sometimes , lying with his back legs on the floor and just dragging himself on his front legs which was really sad to see			2
' it ’s not routinely done in dogs under the age of 10 to 12 months old because you normally have to wait for them to finish growing but because @entity7 was in so much pain we decided to take the risk and put him through the surgery even though he was a very small pet at the time			1
' x-rays : @entity7 's hip joints were disintegrating ( seen left in an x-ray ) leaving the dog in tremendous pain , but the pooch has made a full recovery following a hip replacement ( seen right in an x-ray after the operation ) ' livewire ' : @entity48 ( pictured holding @entity7 ) from @entity49 said staff call the lively cocker spaniel puppy the ' bionic dog ' mr @entity48 , owner of @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 , said that due to a change in family circumstances @entity7 is now looking for a new home			1
he said : ' @entity7 needs space to roam			2
he is such a livewire now			0
whenever he meets you he has just got to climb up you			0
' all he wants to do is sit on your shoulders			0
' if you ’re sat watching tv he ’s not happy on the floor or the sofa - he wants to be on your shoulders			2
' he spends more time on two legs than on four			0
he ’s one of the maddest dogs we ’ve ever had but there ’s no malice in him , ' mr @entity48 said			0
' considering what he ’s gone through it takes some believing			0
we call him the bionic dog			0
