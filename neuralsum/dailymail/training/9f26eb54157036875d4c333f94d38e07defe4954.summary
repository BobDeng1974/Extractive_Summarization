4 right stomach : two playing cards — ace of hearts with the letter ‘ h ’ — believed to represent his fiancee @entity80			0

‘ these are the people nobody cheers for , ’ he announces in a moving video , set to the music of @entity24 ’s soft - rock track @entity25 , that has already attracted more than 1.1million @entity28 views			2
he is shown sitting in the dressing room in quiet contemplation ahead of kick - off against @entity42 before he walks down the tunnel to be met by 45,571 supporters inside the stadium			1
‘ whenever you see me you will see them , ’ he adds as part of a campaign to highlight the 805m people around the world who are affected by hunger			1
‘ they are struck by war , by disaster and extreme poverty			0
’ for a footballer with @entity0 ’s profile , there was no better place to spread his message than the @entity1 just moments after he had scored against @entity42			1
@entity0 trains on monday ahead of @entity4 's key clash against @entity39 on tuesday night the striker will lead the line for the @entity174 champions up against @entity175 ‘ when i took my shirt off against @entity42 , everybody asked what these new tattoos were , ’ he revealed			1
‘ i had 50 removable tattoos on my body , they are the names of real people who are suffering from hunger in the world			1
while those tattoos have gone now , these people are still here ... i hope you can see them through me			2
’ he was booked for the gesture , somewhat reluctantly , by referee @entity191 and will now miss @entity4 ’s @entity193 clash with @entity194			1
tensions are running high in this team and although @entity4 coach @entity36 respects @entity0 ’s humanitarian mission , there was a sting in the tail when he spoke on monday			1
despite the sentiment the striker was booked for his celebration , as the laws of the game dictate @entity36 ( left ) spoke with the press alongside @entity4 centre back and former @entity39 defender @entity208 ( right ) @entity0 has scored twice in the @entity38 this term , including one against old club @entity210 @entity36 said : ‘ i knew about the project , but not the tattoos			1
i knew something was planned at the end of the game , but nothing more			0
‘ he scored early , he took off his shirt and was booked			1
it was good to promote the association , but it did cost us a yellow card			0
imagine if he got another after 20 minutes ? we may as well have abandoned the game in the 70th minute because we would have been down to seven men			0
‘ i do n’t know whether him taking off his shirt was good for us			0
if he scores against @entity39 i hope he does n’t take off his shirt because he will be booked again			1
’ @entity0 ’s goal against @entity42 , in a 2 - 2 draw , was a typical , improvised finish with an outstretched leg			1
the scoreline was not good , but @entity0 ’s goal was a nice way to warm up ahead of this evening ’s first leg			1
last season the legendary @entity233 forward won the 11th league title of his incredible career and yet the @entity38 has eluded him			0
there was a period when the @entity38 meant everything to him , the holy grail in a life that has taken him to @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity210 , @entity241 and @entity4			2
he says he will end his career here			0
off the field his influence continues to grow , to the point where he even felt able to alter the words to the national anthem , in a campaign for @entity252 in collaboration with acclaimed @entity255 songwriter @entity254			2
@entity0 remains the driver of @entity4 , the main man in a team who have struggled to move into @entity261 football ’s fast lane			1
he played in @entity4 ’s 3 - 1 victory here last season , a peripheral figure as goals from @entity264 , an own goal by @entity208 and @entity267 ’s 90th - minute strike sealed an impressive win			1
the forward , @entity233 ’s player of the year for the eighth successive year , was at @entity272 for the second leg but missed the 2 - 0 defeat through injury			0
striker @entity0 missed @entity4 's 2 - 0 defeat to @entity39 in the @entity38 last year as he was injured @entity0 ( left ) enjoyed working under @entity278 ( right ) when they pair were at @entity240 his affection for @entity278 developed during the season they spent together at @entity240 before @entity0 left for @entity210 in 2009			1
when these teams met in the quarter - final last season , @entity0 accepted his chances to finally get his hands on the trophy could well have passed by			2
given his philanthropic gestures , it is clear his work for the @entity20 means just as much to him .			2

@entity0 took off his shirt in support of the @entity20
the @entity255 was marked with the names of 50 people suffering from hunger
@entity0 was booked for the act during the @entity302 match against @entity42
boss @entity36 has expressed his desire for it not to happen again
@entity208 : @entity0 asked me to join him in @entity4 and @entity39 clash
