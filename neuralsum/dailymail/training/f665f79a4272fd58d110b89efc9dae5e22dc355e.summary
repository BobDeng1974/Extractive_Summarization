patients with suspected cancer are being refused urgent tests by @entity5 managers in a ploy to meet waiting times targets , senior doctors have warned			1
some patients have their cancer risk ‘ downgraded ’ and are told they do not qualify for the two - week track			1
they are then not seen for up to six months			0
many are later confirmed to have cancer and campaigners warn that such lengthy delays are putting lives at ‘ serious risk ’			1
but an investigation by @entity29 has identified that doctors are increasingly having referrals ‘ bounced back ’ by hospital managers who say patients are unlikely to have cancer , so can wait longer			2
one , dr @entity35 , based in @entity36 , @entity37 , said an elderly man was made to wait two months for a scan to diagnose bowel cancer which should have been done within two weeks			2
speaking about a general trend , he added : ‘ absolutely this is happening			0
‘ if a case does n’t quite fill the guidance for two - week referral even though clinically you think it is important it gets bounced and you have to make a normal referral			1
’ cancer survival rates in @entity21 are notoriously lower than those elsewhere in @entity23 and this has partly been blamed on @entity25 not picking up the early warning signs , and referring patients for tests another , dr @entity55 , who practises in @entity56 , @entity57 , said a man with suspected bowel cancer was downgraded to only needing a routine scan in 25 weeks ’ time – six months			1
the patient gave up and paid for the colonoscopy check himself , privately , which confirmed he had cancer			0
dr @entity55 said : ‘ his decision to have consultation and colonoscopy privately much quicker may have changed his eventual outcome , as after a 25 - week wait on @entity5 the prognosis may have been very different			1
’ @entity70 , of the charity @entity71 , said : ‘ when gp ’s suspect cancer or want to access more diagnostic tests it is essential they are able to do this easily and quickly			2
‘ it ’s simply not good enough that some people with cancer face waits of up to 25 weeks following an urgent gp referral			1
‘ delays mean that thousands of people with cancer must put their lives on hold while waiting for vital treatment - causing anxiety , distress and putting their lives at serious risk			1
‘ each individual hospital has a responsibility to meet waiting time targets			0
‘ this is yet again another clear warning sign that the system is n’t working and the @entity5 is under huge strain			2
’ under @entity5 guidelines , gps are instructed to refer patients for urgent hospital scans or tests to be carried out within the next two weeks if they suspect cancer			1
doctors fax or email a form detailing the patients ’ symptoms and why they think they might have a particular type of tumour			0
hospital staff are then meant to schedule them in for an appointment with an appropriate consultant specialist who will arrange a scan			0
but doctors suspect that managers at @entity117 - local organisations who control @entity5 budgets – are trying to limit the referrals to ensure their hospital hits target and avoids being fined			2
these managers will have no medical expertise and will simply turn patients away by looking through their form			0
@entity5 targets stay that 93 per cent of patients urgently referred with suspected cancer by @entity25 are seen by the hospital within two weeks otherwise it is fined tens of thousands of pounds			1
professor @entity131 , who specialises in general practice and primary care at the @entity134 , said he understood why managers were trying to limit referrals in order not to have cancer targets breached			0
‘ it ’s interesting that this is appearing and that kind of bears out what i had heard anecdotally			0
’ earlier this year , health secretary @entity145 pledged to name and shame gp surgeries which were referring too few patients for cancer scans on the @entity150 website			2
then last month , the health watchdog @entity151 urged family doctors to refer patients for tests for seemingly banal symptoms such as tiredness , a cough , or bleeding in case it was cancer			0
but such measures will prove futile if @entity25 ’ referrals are just sent back by managers .			0

@entity5 guidelines say 93 *%* of patients given urgent gp referral for suspected cancer should be seen by hospital specialist within two weeks
but some patients have their cancer risk ' downgraded '
told they do *n't* qualify for two - week track , and are not seen for 6 months
campaigners warn such lengthy delays are putting lives at ' serious risk '
