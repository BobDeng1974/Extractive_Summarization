former @entity0 director of football @entity1 believes his @entity4 legacy should be gauged on the burgeoning career of @entity6 rather than the scars left by the @entity9 saga			1
@entity1 was instrumental in buying @entity9 for £ 35million in the january transfer window of 2011 - still the highest fee ever paid for an @entity12 - only to see the striker score just 11 goals in 58 appearances in all competitions before being offloaded on loan initially and then permanently to @entity18 for £ 15million			1
however , @entity1 was also responsible for taking @entity6 from @entity19 to @entity4 for around £ 20million and the @entity21 midfielder and @entity0 vice-captain is tipped to take the armband full - time when @entity24 leaves for the @entity25 at the end of the season			1
@entity1 played a major role in bringing @entity6 and @entity9 to @entity4 former @entity0 director of football @entity1 was sacked by the @entity31 club in april 2012 @entity9 - £ 35million @entity32 - £ 20m @entity34 - @entity33 @entity6 - £ 16m @entity35 - £ 22m @entity36 - £ 5m @entity37 - £ 9m @entity38 - £ 7m a defiant @entity1 believes the @entity9 episode should be consigned to history , saying : ' the decision was made in a conference call between the owners , myself , @entity45 ( the manager at the time ) and the commercial director at the time who is now chief executive , @entity49			1
' we made the decision collectively , knowing exactly the money we would lose if it did not work out , and they said they were happy to go ahead with the transfer			2
' i will stick to what i have always said about @entity9			1
when he is fit , he is unplayable			2
when he has been fit at @entity18 , he has shown what he can do , scoring goals , making assists , being a constant threat			2
' when people say we made a mistake , i 'm still not convinced we made a mistake			0
it 's just we have n't seen the best of @entity9 because of all the injuries			2
' @entity6 , pictured with @entity69 , is expected to replace @entity24 as @entity0 captain @entity1 insists the success of @entity6 at @entity4 , plus the development of winger @entity73 and full back @entity74 , only highlights the need for the continuity and stability he believes is provided by a director of football			1
the 42 - year - old , who was also director of football at @entity81 and who was passing on his experience this week to future sporting directors in a lecture at @entity86 , said : ' nothing is guaranteed			0
' what we do is try to lower the risk in the decision - making process			0
but we are dealing with human beings			0
it is not as though we are buying shares or property			0
' sometimes things work out , sometimes they do n't			0
sometimes life gets in the way of talent , sometimes there are injuries , sometimes the player does n't adapt to one place			0
@entity1 helped @entity0 conclude a deal for then @entity105 striker @entity35 in january 2011 ' i do n't think i have to justify whether @entity9 was a good decision or a bad decision			1
look at it as a whole			0
when people talk to me nowadays about @entity0 , they say what a fantastic job you did in bringing players like @entity35 and @entity6 to the club			1
' the issue i have got is when a group of owners approach somebody like me and say we want to invest for the long term , we want you to sign young players , we want you to put together a squad which has a future for the next three to five years , we want you to work with the academy and we start to do all this and after a few months or a few years they say : " sorry , it 's not working out "			0
' you can not say you have to focus on the future and at the same time say the young players are not ready to compete at the top level			0
' when i left @entity0 , the owners told me @entity6 was a massive mistake			1
now he 's turned out to be the next @entity0 captain and he 's a regular in every game			1
' the two - year masters in @entity136 course was launched in 2014 at @entity86 and prepares candidates from across sport for a strategic role at a club or in a league			2
the inaugural @entity142 will be held in @entity143 on april 29 .			0

@entity1 believes he should be judged on bringing @entity6 to @entity0 rather than @entity9
the former @entity147 chief played major role in bringing @entity9 to @entity4
@entity0 forked out £ 35million on the then @entity151 striker in 2011
