but officers discovered the heroin - which was 100 per cent pure - after an undercover operation by the @entity18			2
@entity1 has now been jailed for nine years after being found guilty at @entity19 of drugs smuggling			1

the package , sent in september 2012 , also included ludo boards and dried fruit			2
but @entity1 's covert operation was discovered when the package was spotted by the @entity32			2
the court heard the parcel had been addressed to ' mr @entity35 ' in @entity36 , @entity8			0
although the name was fake , the address used was real			0
once the package had been intercepted , a detective from the @entity18 posed as a @entity42 delivery man so he could drop off the dummy delivery at the house			1

the number led to a line which had been set up by the @entity18 for the operation			0
