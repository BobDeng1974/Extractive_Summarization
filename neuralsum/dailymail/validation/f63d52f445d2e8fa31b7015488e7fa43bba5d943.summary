@entity0 by @entity1 as usual with books about crazed adventures and daft derring - do , this one , about the author ’s attempt to swim the length of the @entity10 coastline , begins with an account of the preparation involved			1
however , very unusually for such books and adventures , @entity1 ’s account is mainly about what he has n’t thought of doing			1
charity swimmer @entity1 , 32 ( pictured ) , arriving at @entity16 , in the north of @entity18 , after being the first person to swim from @entity20 to @entity16 just weeks before he ’s due to dive into the sea off @entity20 , he has n’t done any training or sought any funding and has no ‘ plan ’ to speak of			1
nor is this some long - held ambition of his			0
indeed , it seems that he only thought of this ultra-long - distance swim up the @entity10 coast because his attempt to cycle around the world did n’t happen as he ’d have wished — all was going well until he had a crash and , although he completed the pan-global bike ride , it could n’t get him into the @entity37			1
so , the swim is meant to fill that crucial gap in his cv			2
somehow , he manages to acquire three people to act as his support crew and a cut - price yacht , leaving £ 110 in his budget for everything else — supplies , equipment , the lot			0
not surprisingly , there are those who tell him he ’s crazy and that he ’d be best off spending his last £ 110 on the medication his gp would surely be only too happy to prescribe			2
but on our hero ploughs , somehow gaining a bit of sponsorship ( partly from @entity58 , the trunks people ) and eventually managing to get his support crew to @entity20 to start his @entity61			0
only to discover two problems			0
first , there ’s the temperature : ‘ i slowly walked into the water , ’ @entity1 recalls , ‘ and was surprised at how cold it was			1
turns out the sea is not only cold , it apparently also has these things called tides			0
as he ’s settling down to his first crawl , it begins to dawn on @entity74 that he ’ll have to time his swims so that he ’s going with the tide rather than against it — because even @entity78 at full tilt would n’t be a match for the current and would start to go backwards			2
which is exactly what happens to @entity1			1
soon after , there ’s another problem — seasickness , for @entity1 , as well as two of his support crew			1
there are lots and lots of other dangers ahead , almost all of them coming as a shock to our intrepid swimmer			2
between @entity97 and the north coast of @entity18 , there will be whirlpools , riptides , the mountainous seas off @entity102 , busy shipping lanes , a tornado warning and toxic jellyfish			0
plus his scabby toe gets worse daily , his wetsuit does n’t fit properly , he has to eat about 8,000 calories a day , often in mid-swim , and the protein shakes are giving him wind something dreadful			0
@entity1 ’s original ‘ plan ’ was that he ’d be swimming for two months			1
a thousand miles of coastline , call it 900 miles for luck , 15 miles a day , 60 days ’ swimming			2
@entity117 ! well , not quite			0
his daily distance is initially so low that , by his new calculations , it will take him two years to reach @entity16			0
then , amazingly , he starts to grind out the miles			0
more calamities lie in store — running out of money , losing members of his support crew — but @entity1 copes with them all			1
and , astonishingly , remarkably and record - breakingly , 135 days after he walked into the surprisingly cold sea off @entity20 , he swims into @entity129 ’s harbour			1

just weeks before the swim @entity1 had *n't* done any training
@entity1 *faced* plenty of dangers on his swim , not least the *icy* waters
it took him 135 days to swim to the harbour at @entity129 ’s
