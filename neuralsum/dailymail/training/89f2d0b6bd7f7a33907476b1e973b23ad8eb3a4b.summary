by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:44 est , 17 february 2013 updated : 10:02 est , 18 february 2013 second wife : @entity3 , pictured with his second wife @entity4 , has spoken out about his relationship with his children from his first marriage the familiar voice appeared to break as @entity3 spoke about his two daughters from his first marriage			1
‘ my relationship with my kids is the one sad area of my life , ’ the cricket commentator lamented yesterday in an emotional moment on @entity13 ’s @entity12			1
@entity3 , the voice of @entity20 cricket , told presenter @entity21 of the ‘ tough time ’ he had maintaining his relationship with @entity24 and @entity25 after his divorce from their mother @entity27			1
the 52 - year - old former @entity30 fast bowler , affectionately known as @entity3 , went on to say he wanted to ‘ stand up ’ for absent fathers in broken families who want to play a part in their children ’s lives			1
and he described how he and his second wife @entity4 had made a ‘ conscious effort ’ to ensure that her former husband maintained a relationship with his children from that marriage			1
yesterday , however , the first mrs @entity41 insisted it is the @entity20 cricket correspondent ’s ‘ own fault ’ that he does n’t have a better relationship with @entity24 , 27 , and 24 - year - old @entity25			1
she said : ‘ he has had the opportunity to see and be with his children any time he chooses			1
he ’s been in control of that			2
so , if he has n’t taken part in their lives that ’s been his choice			2
‘ he ’s never been stopped from seeing his children and i do n’t think i ’ve made it difficult at all			2
’ mrs @entity41 , 56 , who owns a child care centre in @entity54 , said her former husband has provided for her children financially but has not been there emotionally			2
she said : ‘ i think he feels if he ’s done financial stuff he ’s done his bit as a dad , but actually kids just want some time			1
‘ he thinks he can buy them a nice @entity64 present and they do n’t need to be spoken to for a few months			2
’ perhaps the most stinging criticism came from @entity68 ’s own daughters who claim to have felt like ‘ an embarrassment ’ to their father once he remarried			1
@entity25 , who works with her mother , said : ‘ if it was n’t for @entity74 we would n’t have a relationship with him			1
' we ’ve felt very unimportant since @entity76 married @entity4 – pushed out			0
we always felt like an embarrassment			0
we ’ve both wanted to be part of his life but we ’ve just never felt involved			0
’ @entity24 , a veterinary nurse , added : ‘ because we did n’t have much of a relationship when we were young , it ’s difficult now we ’re adults			1
‘ he does n’t know anything about me now			0
he has a much better relationship with his stepchildren than he does with us			2

he ’s been given multiple chances			0
’ test match special broadcaster @entity3 was apparently astounded that his daughters were not among those listening to him on the radio			1
mrs @entity41 said : ‘ he said to me once , “ my children have no idea who i am and what i do ” – because they did n’t listen to the cricket on the radio			0
' i said , “ you are their dad and what you do is irrelevant ”			0
he thought his children should listen to the cricket to know what he did but it ’s not really the kind of thing girls like is it ? ’ mrs @entity41 said she ‘ gave up everything ’ to be with the cricketer after meeting him when he was on tour with his county team @entity119 in her home country of @entity121			0
he joined @entity122 in 1991 and mrs @entity41 said their ten - year marriage , which ended in 1993 , was ‘ difficult ’ because he would be abroad for months covering games			2
young father : @entity3 with his first wife @entity27 and baby daughter @entity25 in 1986 she added that her former husband has let his daughters down ‘ repeatedly ’ over the years , missing school pick - ups , parents ’ evenings and sports days			1
mrs @entity41 said : ‘ @entity24 had a school concert when she was about ten or 11			1
he only came back from abroad that day			0
happy : @entity3 pictured with his second wife @entity4 ' he turned up at the concert , came late , sat down and his daughter sang one of her four songs and he got up and walked out because he was tired			1
‘ i was looking at her face and the disappointment ... it would have been better had he not come at all			0
you ca n’t explain that to children			0
’ @entity3 married @entity4 in 1996 and became stepfather to @entity147 , 22 , and 19 - year - old @entity148			1
the commentator said yesterday he was ‘ proud ’ that he and @entity4 had helped her first husband , @entity150 , keep in contact with his children			0
he told how mr @entity150 , a solicitor who died of motor neurone disease in 2005 , would enjoy family meals with them and even go on holiday with them			0
but his first wife insists she too had done all she could to help her daughters keep in contact with their father			1
she said : ‘ i even went and had @entity64 dinners with them where i joined his new family so the children could see him , which was a very uncomfortable situation for me			0
i had to bury my pride on many occasions			0
’ mrs @entity41 added : ‘ his relationship with his children is on and off			2
they ’re both adults now so they ’re old enough to have their own relationship			2
' @entity172 ’s just been for a job interview which he knew about but has n’t bothered to ask about			0
‘ he always said i should remind him of these things			0
it ’s not for me to be his secretary			0
he can pick up the phone			0

he is father to @entity24 , 27 , and @entity25 , 24 , from first marriage to @entity183
