by @entity0 and @entity1 whistleblower : former matron @entity3 leaked an email from previous employers @entity5 a former matron has been left jobless after revealing that a prestigious private school ran out of ‘ morning after ’ pills			1
@entity3 had been due to start work at the @entity10 later this year – but last week it withdrew its job offer			1
mrs @entity3 leaked an email from her previous employers , @entity5 , which was published in @entity15 last week			1
it detailed the ‘ great concern ’ staff had over pupils having sex in the £ 33,000 - a - year school ’s boarding houses			1
the day after our exposé , ms @entity3 received a call from the @entity27 - based ballet school – and 24 hours later was told she could no longer take up her new post as a £ 19,600 - a-year assistant			1
she suspects @entity5 had ‘ smeared ’ her – a claim that headteacher @entity31 strenuously rebuts			1
ms @entity3 , 57 , says she was warned before the story was published that the head was threatening to write to the @entity10 if she continued to cooperate with this newspaper			1
but dr @entity31 ‘ categorically ’ denied contacting the dance school			0
the @entity10 confirmed it had ‘ no contact ’ with the head , although it said its human resources department had been in touch with @entity5 ’s hr staff the day after the story appeared as part of ‘ normal ’ checks on references ms @entity3 had provided more than a month earlier			1
ms @entity3 has nevertheless consulted legal advisers claiming she had been the victim of ‘ smears ’ , including initial suggestions by the school that the email might have been ‘ doctored ’			1
she said : ‘ i feel i ’m being picked on by some very influential parties			0
@entity5 have over-reacted and been heavy - handed			0
’ ms @entity3 worked at @entity5 for two years as a matron , but left earlier this year after bullying claims			1
she and a matron friend at @entity5 , @entity54 , decided to leak the email to expose what they saw as weaknesses in the school ’s policies to protect pupils , including its decision to scrap live - in matrons			2
no longer wanted : @entity27 's @entity10 , which withdrew its offer to @entity3			1
its human resources department had been in touch with @entity5 's hr staff as part of ' normal ' checks on references on the day before we published the story , dr @entity31 cast doubt on the leaked email , telling us it may have been ‘ altered and doctored to sensationalise a matter of pastoral concern ’			1
during that day ms @entity3 received a call from ms @entity77 , saying that dr @entity31 planned on writing to the @entity10			1
ms @entity77 , who is now suspended from the @entity79 school , also claimed that she was being ‘ threatened with everything ’ – including the sack – if she could not persuade ms @entity82 to stop the story			2
when ms @entity3 refused to back down , dr @entity31 enlisted the services of spin doctors @entity86 and media lawyer @entity87			2
previous employers : £ 33,000 - a - year @entity5			2
@entity31 strenuously rebuts ms @entity3 's claim that the school ' smeared ' her following her decision to leak an email to @entity15 on monday ms @entity3 was called by the @entity10 ’s hr manager @entity93 who said they had questions over why she had left @entity5			1
the next day ms @entity93 told ms @entity3 she had spoken to @entity5 and the job offer was withdrawn			1
dr @entity31 said ; ‘ i am sorry the @entity10 have not taken forward her contract			0
they have inferred that there was a compromise agreement [ over ms @entity3 leaving @entity5 ] and they clearly feel something had gone wrong that make her references perhaps not as robust as they might be			1
what i can say categorically is that i did not contact by any means or by a third party the @entity10			0
’ he refused to comment on ms @entity77 ’s call to ms @entity3 but denied making any threats to ms @entity77			2
however ms @entity3 said : ‘ i turned whistleblower to expose a serious matter of public interest			2
now i have lost my prospective job , my future home and my livelihood			0
’ memories : @entity120 was a sixth former at @entity5 from 2006 - 2008 the motto at @entity5 , ‘ persto et praesto – i persist and i excel ’ , was a source of inspiration for pupils when i attended			2
especially when it came to having sex			0
teachers knew it was happening , but there was n’t much they could do about it			0
confined to the school grounds for weeks at a time with hormones raging , pupils were regularly having sex			2
there was a game known as the @entity140 , where couples would compete to have sex at all of the 40 tiny neo-classical buildings in the school ’s 750 acres			0
in one girls ’ boarding house , a tally chart of locations where pupils had sex was updated regularly			0
pupils had sex anywhere they could : in unlocked classrooms in the evenings , in the cricket pavilion , even outside boarding houses			0
i never heard of anyone getting caught , but there were a few close calls			0
once a girl was forced to sneak out of a boy ’s bedroom window when the housemaster came knocking			0
these rendezvous were n’t one - night stands , but part of loving relationships – and never underage as the school only accepts girls from 16			0
two old school friends are still going out with the boyfriends they met aged 16			0
all the girls knew that the school ’s medical centre , the @entity176 , stocked the morning - after pill			0
on at least one occasion i accompanied a friend to get one			0
the school should be both open and realistic about sex and accept that it ’s better to prepare , and offer pupils contraception if they need it .			2
