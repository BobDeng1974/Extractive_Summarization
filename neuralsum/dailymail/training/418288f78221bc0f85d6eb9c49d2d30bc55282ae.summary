' the cartoon had its genesis in news photographs of men seated in chairs and lounges , observing the shelling of @entity5 from the hills of @entity56 , ' @entity10 editor - in - chief @entity20 said on monday the cartoon was reportedly based on the @entity69 ( pictured ) who stood on a hill at the @entity69 town of @entity56 , overlooking the @entity5 , as they watched smoke rising following an @entity69 strike on @entity5 , on july 12 ' it was wrong to publish the cartoon in its original form			1

@entity10 columnist @entity57 says he has been ' fiercely slandered by the jewish community ' over his column the columnist received a huge reactionto his strongly - worded column on july 26 in his strongly - worded article , which came as a reaction to the death of hundreds of @entity103 , @entity57 said @entity69 ' is waging its own war of terror on the entire @entity5 population of about 1.7 million people			1
call it genocide , call it ethnic cleansing : the aim is to kill @entity112 '			0

' and @entity175 asked : ' when will the @entity49 be apologising for the @entity137 cartoon ? many people offended by that as well			0
