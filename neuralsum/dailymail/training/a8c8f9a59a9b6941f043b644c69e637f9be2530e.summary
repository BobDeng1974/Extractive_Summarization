by @entity0 for @entity1 aviation authorities are trying to calm passengers ’ fears over an @entity5 volcano that is at risk of erupting			2
the @entity8 ’s @entity7 ( @entity9 ) and air traffic control company @entity10 say @entity8 is better prepared than in 2010 to deal with a potential ash cloud crisis if the @entity14 volcano erupts			1
the organisations have reassured travellers they will not see a repeat of the chaos when the gigantic ash cloud caused by the @entity21 volcano grounded more than 100,000 flights and ruined millions of holidays			1
no fear : authorities say they are better prepared to deal with an ash cloud crisis after an eruption in 2010 the @entity28 said the area around the @entity14 volcano is still being rocked by hundreds of earthquakes each day , but there are no signs of magma moving to the surface			1
two intense earthquake swarms were first detected last saturday at @entity5 ’s largest volcano , which is located under the country ’s largest glacier			0
as a precaution , police have evacuated an area north of the volcano , about 200 miles northeast of the capital @entity44 , and closed roads			0
the country has raised its aviation alert level to orange , the second - highest level on the five - colour scale			0
both the @entity9 and @entity10 said the @entity8 is much better prepared to deal with any ash cloud crisis based on lessons learned four years ago , and there are now arrangements in place to minimise disruptions and maintain public safety			1
a @entity10 spokeswoman said : ‘ we are monitoring the situation in @entity5 and we do n’t know how serious it will get and just where any ash cloud will travel if the volcano erupts			0
' stay away : police have closed roads and evacuated an area near the @entity14 volcano in @entity5 the spokeswoman said : ‘ even in a worst - case scenario we are in a much better position to deal with this than we were in 2010			1
’ in 2010 , the eruption of @entity5 ’s @entity21 volcano led to much of @entity73 ’s airspace being shut down for six days , causing widespread cancellations and losses of more than £ 1.2 billion			2
since then , aviation authorities have implemented a number of improvements , including a system that gives airlines access to wider airspace in the event of an eruption , a radar in @entity5 that detects ash particles in the atmosphere , and enhanced ash cloud models and forecasts that help them to identify the areas to avoid , the @entity9 said			0
in 2010 , the situation was aggravated by strong northerly winds and unusually high volumes of fine ash that posed a danger to jet engines .			0

authorities are *confident* travellers will not see a repeat of 2010
four years ago , more than 100,00 flights were grounded after an eruption
no signs of magma moving to surface of @entity14 volcano
