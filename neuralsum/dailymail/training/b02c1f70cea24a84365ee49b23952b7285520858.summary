the unidentified , bearded man , who appears to have suffered ‘ numerous ’ injuries , was found lying in surf wearing just a pair of socks and a shoe			1
but the bag and black and white headgear , which washed up near the corpse at @entity18 in @entity19 , may provide an insight into his mysterious death			1
discovery : @entity23 and @entity24 found the hat on the same day as the body , but now believe it may have belonged to the unidentified victim bag : officers investigating the murder also found a black rucksack at the scene other clues discovered by police include a set of keys and a faded black and white photo of a boy , which is said to have been taken in 1952			1
officers hope anyone who recognises the image can help them with their inquiries			0
almost a week after the body was found , his identity is still a mystery , leading police appeal to anyone who might recognise any of the items			1
the body was found by a member of the public on tuesday afternoon			2
the white man is thought to be aged between 50 and 70 , with white receding hair with a bald patch and a thick white beard			2
a day later , a navy blue regatta coat was found nearby containing a wallet and a faded picture of a child			2
a date on the back of the picture reads april 13 , 1952 , but it is unclear what this refers to or if the jacket and wallet even belonged to the dead man			2
his injuries are understood not to be consistent with drowning , and it is believed the man had something wedged in his throat			1
it was initially thought the man may have killed himself but @entity23 and @entity24 say he had multiple suspicious injuries			2

’ yesterday police confirmed that the investigation had changed direction			0
detective chief inspector @entity108 , from @entity23 and @entity24 , said : ‘ we are now treating the discovery of the body as suspicious			0
' the change in tack has come about as a result of the post-mortem			0
