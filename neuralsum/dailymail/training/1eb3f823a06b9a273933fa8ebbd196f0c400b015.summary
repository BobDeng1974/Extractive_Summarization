@entity1 boss @entity0 has launched an attack on directors of football , insisting that he could never work alongside one at @entity6			1
the former @entity8 boss ripped into the system used by @entity8 , who sit 12th in the @entity11 following a huge but generally unsuccessful recruitment drive in the summer of 2013			2
under the guidance of technical director @entity16 , the north @entity14 outfit spent the money earned from @entity19 's world record move to @entity20 on seven players at a cost of Â£ 107million			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 has criticised the role of director of football , claiming the job is ' nonsense ' @entity8 striker @entity27 has struggled since being bought by @entity16 in the summer of 2013 @entity0 takes pride in signing his own players , such as striker @entity30 ( right ) , at @entity1 @entity31 was sacked by chairman @entity32 just a few months later , with summer acquisitions including @entity34 , @entity27 and @entity35 failing to live up to their hefty price - tags			1
@entity0 , who has complete control of purchases at @entity1 , can not see the sense in managers being forced to work with players that they have not chosen themselves			1
in an interview with the @entity45 , @entity0 said : ' it totally undermines your role as manager if you 're not picking the players			2
it 's a joke really that you are expected to work with someone else 's players			2
it 's all very well someone recommending players to you but when they do n't work out , it 's your head on the block			0
' the 67 - year - old made his feelings about working under a director of football clear to @entity8 when he moved to @entity65 in 2008 , resulting in @entity66 being sacked			1
@entity16 , pictured watching @entity8 face @entity67 , makes decisions on player signings at @entity65 @entity1 sit 19th in the @entity11 after an enthralling 2 - 2 draw with @entity67 last time out ex-spurs boss @entity0 does n't think managers should be accountable for players they have n't signed and @entity0 insists that it is not fair that managers are judged - and possibly sacked - because of decisions not made by them			1
he added : ' i 'm just not in favour of that			0
as a manager i have to select the players , train them every day and make decisions			0
to expect me to work with players someone else has decided i want is a nonsense			0
i want to make my own decisions and rightfully so			0
if things do n't work out fine , i 'm responsible for that			0
but why should i be accountable for someone else 's mistakes ? ' my head 's on the block when it goes wrong so no i 'm not going to support something that could cost me my job and i have no say in it			0
