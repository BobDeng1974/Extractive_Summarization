by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:01 pm on 22nd november 2011 @entity3 's former adviser today claimed she was bullied into going to rehab after her client became convinced she was leaking stories to the press			1
giving evidence to the @entity9 , @entity7 described how the supermodel confronted her and accused her of being an alcoholic who was unintentionally passing private details to journalists			1
she was told she had to go to therapy centre @entity14 , in @entity16 , otherwise she would be immediately sacked			1
mrs @entity7 said that she at first resisted - but eventually felt she had no choice but to go			1
she completed the programme and was then dismissed by the model			1
adviser : @entity7 ( left ) was accused of leaking stories to the press by her client @entity3			1
the allegations eventually led to her being sacked it eventually emerged that the probable source of the stories was voicemails that had been hacked on the behest of the @entity30			1
mrs field , who is a specialist in intellectual property rights , laid out how she was working for an international tax and accountancy firm when she met ms @entity3 in 2003			2
she said she got on well with the model - who , like her , came from @entity37 , @entity38 - and ms @entity3 quickly became her client			1
mrs @entity7 said the partnership was ' very successful ' from both a ' financial ' and ' developmental ' point of view and they became friends			1
she told the inquiry the model would confide in her			1
but their relationship began to deteriorate after a series of stories appeared in the papers in 2005			1
these revolved around the breakdown of ms @entity54 's relationship to financier @entity55			2
mrs @entity7 described the articles as ' tittle - tattle			1
' she said the model became concerned about ' listening devices ' and security checks were carried out but nothing was found			1
witness : comedian @entity63 ( front left ) arrives at at the @entity65 with barrister @entity66 ( front , right ) a former @entity69 footballer who tried to stop a tabloid paper publishing details of his adultery suggested today that journalists may have hacked his phone			2
@entity75 captain @entity74 took out an injunction in april 2001 to prevent the @entity78 newspaper running a ' kiss and tell ' story about a brief affair			2
this was overturned by the @entity83 in early 2002 , leading to public humiliation for the married father when his name was finally disclosed			2
@entity74 told the @entity9 into press standards today that he ' strongly suspected ' that reporters hacked his phone to discover details of a second woman with whom he had an affair			1
but he admitted he had no firm evidence that his voicemail messages were illegally intercepted			1
he told the inquiry : ' that is just speculation			2
i have no evidence at all			1
it just seems a massive coincidence that the same newspaper gets two girls in the space of a couple of months			2
' @entity74 , who is now manager of @entity107 side @entity106 , said he had an ' intimate relationship ' with the first woman , whom he saw ' three or four times '			2
he claimed that she contacted him threatening to go to the press if he did not give her £ 3,000 for a breast enlargement operation , which he refused			2
the former footballer said the woman sent an envelope to his mother 's house containing copies of text messages he had sent her and details of precisely when they went to a hotel together			2
@entity74 said he showed the envelope to the solicitor of the @entity127 , and as a result took out the injunction against the @entity78			2
explaining why he resorted to legal action , he said : ' i hold my hands up and i know i did wrong , but nobody 's perfect and at the end of the day i had a wife and a kid , and i had a very close family , and i did not want it to get out to them			2
' the inquiry heard that the people was edited at the time by @entity143 , who went on to become executive editor of the @entity30			2
@entity74 said the people printed hints about his identity , such as that he played for an ' unfashionable ' club in the @entity149 , before the injunction was overturned			0
the @entity154 - born father - of - three , who is now separated from his wife and living with his girlfriend , @entity153 , said he was subsequently contacted by the second woman , who demanded £ 5,000 in return for not selling her story to the people			0
he said he was surprised by this because the first woman lived in @entity160 and the second in @entity162 , and they did not know each other			0
' i strongly suspect that my phone was hacked by journalists and as a result the second woman was contacted , and asked to sell her story to the papers , ' he said in a statement to the inquiry			0
@entity172 , counsel to the inquiry , said both women denied blackmailing @entity74			0
mrs @entity7 said she was contacted by a lawyer representing ms @entity3 and told that the model was ' not prepared to have me speaking in the press any more '			1
so i called @entity3 , ' said @entity178			0
' it was the first time she was really grouchy with me			0
she said " i ca n't have you speaking to the media			0
you have been speaking to the press "			0
' mrs @entity7 told the inquiry that she had ' absolutely not ' been speaking to the media about ms @entity3			1
the situation finally came to a head when @entity178 returned home to find her husband had received a phone call from the model 's lawyer			1
he had said she was going to be sacked , adding ' @entity192 says she knows you were n't doing it on purpose			1
you did it because you 're an alcoholic '			0
mrs @entity7 agreed to attend a meeting with the model a few days later			1
' @entity3 wanted to see me on her own , ' she told @entity200			0
i went in and she puts her arms around me and cries and she says she knows what it 's like to be an alcoholic			0
' she says she know i would never have spoken to the media if i was not an alcoholic			0
' mrs @entity7 told the inquiry that after half an hour of ' psychobabble ' , she asked to see her husband			1
he came in , along with representatives from mrs field 's firm @entity212 and the supermodel 's lawyer			0
' i know it sounds like a b - movie , ' @entity178 continued			0
' they proceeded to trash my reputation , trash everything and said i had to go to this place			1
i was n't going to go			0
' mrs @entity7 and her husband left the meeting and went home			1
at that stage she was still adamant that she would not go into rehab			1
but a few days later , at a second meeting with the model , she gave in			2
' she totally broke me down and i gave in and went to this horrible place , ' she said			0
' @entity192 had made out it was a spa			0
it was a grade one psychiatric hospital with men with guns parading around			0
' for the first ten days you 're in this hospital where there 's no plugs in the hand basins in case you drown yourself			0
they try and make you take anti-depressants			0
i would n't take them and they thought i was hostile			0
' i 'm a runner and i wanted to use the gym and they would n't let me because they said it was ' obsessive behaviour ' ... ' they said i was getting intervention - like in those @entity250 renditions			0
' i had to share a dormitory			0
one woman injected drugs between her toes			0
i 'd never met anyone like that before			0
' after ten days they said that i was n't an alcoholic and that i 'd been bullied			0
' @entity178 was diagnosed with adjustment disorder which she described as the @entity263 phrase for stress			0
but she stayed for the five - week programme - which was being paid for by her firm and ms @entity268 - and then returned to work			1
she told @entity200 that she had ' kept her side of the bargain ' and believed that things would return to normal			0
however , she was immediately fired by ms @entity3 and later made redundant by @entity212 in march 2006			0
mrs @entity7 said it was not until the arrest of @entity30 royal editor @entity276 and private investigator @entity277 in august 2006 that she realised what had happened			1
the financial adviser said her experience had had a massive impact on her - both professionally and personally			1
she attributed the decline in her health , which eventually led to her having a pacemaker fitted in 2009 , as at least partly related to what had happened			2
mrs @entity7 has spoken to police about her phone being hacked and is seeking damages through the @entity65 .			1
