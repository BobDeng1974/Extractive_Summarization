a @entity1 men 's underwear brand named @entity2 simply will not fly in @entity3 , says the @entity4			1
the agency has denied the @entity8 company 's application to register the trademark in the @entity3 , calling the name ' vulgar			1
' the company was born in 2013 and quickly moved to the @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 where it promises its underwear -- designed with @entity19 technology -- reduces heat while allowing for freer movement			1
' the mark does not create a double entendre or other idiomatic expression , ' they wrote			1
' when used in this way , the word , ‘ balls ’ has an offensive meaning			0
' as the @entity42 notes , another trademark -- this one from an @entity3 company -- had previously been denied by the agency for a similar reason			2
undaunted : the company 's founder says he 'll petition for a review of the decision and cites other similar trademarks such as ' @entity50 ' and i love my balls ' that have been allowed through the process @entity56 's ice cream flavor @entity54 -- so named after a well - known @entity58 sketch -- saw only a short - lived release in 2011 after the agency blocked a trademark for its name			1
on the @entity2 website , a typical pair of the garments costs 298.00 krone			0
while the site does not appear to ship @entity2 stateside just yet , that 's around 40 @entity3 dollars			0
the company 's undaunted founder @entity67 has asked for a review of the patent office 's decision and notes similar trademarks that have been allowed through the process			0
' " @entity50 " and " i love my balls " have recently both been approved by the @entity4 , ' he said			0
' luckily , @entity75 have a softer view on what is deemed to be vulgar and the @entity78 allowed @entity2 to trademark without hassle earlier this year			0
' should have been funnier : the @entity4 said the trademark also ' does not create a double entendre or other idiomatic expression '			2

the brand has *spread* to @entity15 , @entity14 and the @entity13 but @entity3 is *n't* having it
the agency says the name refers solely to a *man* 's testicles and ' does not create a double entendre ' -- and is *therefor* vulgar
@entity56 's @entity54 brand ice cream was also blocked by the @entity94
