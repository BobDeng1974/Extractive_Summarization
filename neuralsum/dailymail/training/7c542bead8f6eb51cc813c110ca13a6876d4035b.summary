@entity0 , pictured with her son , @entity1 , was told by the swimming pool manager to stop breastfeeding her son swimming pool staff told a mother to stop breastfeeding in case her baby vomited into the water			1
@entity0 was swimming with 10 - month - old @entity1 in @entity9 , @entity10 , when he became hungry - so she got out of the pool , moved a few steps away and began feeding him			1
but the 23 - year - old said she was told to retreat further to the changing rooms and not come back for half an hour in case @entity1 was sick			1
ms @entity0 , from @entity15 , @entity10 , complained the intervention by a manager at the @entity18 left her feeling angry and embarrassed			1
' he 's a breast fed baby and always has been , ' she said			0
' i got in the pool and he was a bit unsettled , so i decided to give him a really quick feed , as more of a comfort thing than anything else , rather than a full feed			2
' i went to the side of the pool and up some steps away from the pool			2
i noticed the lifeguard go onto his walky talkie , and then a manager came out to speak to me			0
' they told me i would have to leave and not come back until the milk had digested			2
' the pool was n't busy and i was n't showing off my boobs , but they asked me to sit in the changing rooms			1
' i just said it was fine , but i was a bit embarrassed and when i left and got home i started to get a bit angry			0
' the @entity47 makes it illegal to discriminate against a woman for breastfeeding in a public place			0
the manager involved has since written to apologise to ms @entity0 , who lives with her partner @entity52 , 32 , a diving instructor			1
but @entity54 , which runs the pool , insisted staff were simply trying to maintain water quality			0
the half an hour period was imposed to make sure @entity1 had digested all his milk			1
marketing manager @entity61 said : ' this is very much an issue of maintaining water quality as we work hard to keep the water in all our pools safe and clean			0
' the member of staff was concerned that a baby that has just been fed could very easily be sick in the pool			0
ms @entity0 was also banned from returning to the water for half an hour in case @entity1 was sick ' this would obviously not be pleasant for other users and could potentially lead to a pool closure which would inconvenience many other customers			1
' at the moment we do n't have a specific policy on breastfeeding on poolside as we assume most customers realise the implications and it has not previously been an issue			0
' the centre manager in this instance has written to the customer apologising for any upset and made a judgement in advance of a company - wide policy being introduced that it is currently acceptable at that centre			2
' we seek to make our facilities open and welcoming to everyone of all ages but the priority is always the health and safety of everyone			0
' ms @entity0 added : ' i 'm a confident feeder but some girls are n't and something like that could really shake their confidence			2
i was polite but i should have argued against it			0
' it 's a lovely pool - really warm and clean and i have been there loads of times - but i felt really embarrassed by being asked to leave when i was n't doing anything wrong			1
' hygiene : @entity0 was told to breastfeed in the changing rooms instead of near the pool at @entity18 in @entity9 , @entity10 - but staff insist they were being health - conscious in case the baby vomited			1
