the plan has echoes of @entity154 cut - price pioneer sir @entity152 whose cheap @entity156 flights to the @entity28 transformed transatlantic travel for the masses , until effectively killed off by the established airlines , though it inspired sir @entity160 to launch @entity98			2

’ mr @entity122 told delegates that @entity123 ’s ‘ ten bucks ’ flights could start in four years ’ time : ’ but we ’re not going to do it until we ’ve got some planes			2
’ and currently the price of the long - haul aircraft required is simply too high because @entity180 state airlines were buying them up from @entity90 and @entity182 and there was insufficient availability : ’ ‘ they ’ve put in gargantuan long - haul orders			0
so there ’s no availability on suitable aircraft			0
’ @entity190 , chief financial officer with low - cost @entity11 , who shared the same platform with mr @entity122 said his at the time airline had bought 220 planes costing £ 13billion and would use some of them to run transatlantic flights from @entity198 to @entity14 for ‘ around £ 100 each way ’ .			1
