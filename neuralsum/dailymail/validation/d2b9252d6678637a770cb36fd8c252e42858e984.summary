@entity0 has suggested next year 's @entity2 @entity1 could also fall by the wayside just days after this season 's race was officially dropped from the @entity7 calendar			1
as per their contract , @entity8 is scheduled to host the event in 2016 , but at this early stage @entity7 supremo @entity0 is uncertain whether it will go ahead			1
asked whether he could confirm it would take place , @entity0 , speaking to a select media group in the paddock at the @entity19 @entity1 , replied : ' no. ' @entity0 ( left ) says @entity2 @entity1 may miss out on the @entity7 calendar next year informed that @entity8 has a contract for 2016 and 2018 , @entity0 added : ' it does n't make a difference			1
a lot of people have a contract			0
' @entity0 intimated if @entity2 was unable to afford the race this year , then it will struggle to pay the hosting fee next season			2
the @entity31 was scheduled to host the race in july , but due to numerous financial difficulties behind the scenes was ultimately forced to withdraw			2
@entity0 then turned to @entity8 to step in and fill the void , but negotiations broke down and time ran out as circuit officials believed they did not have ample time to promote and sell tickets			2
@entity8 and @entity31 have hosted the @entity2 @entity1 for the past seven years ' the trouble in @entity2 was the @entity31 spent an awful lot of money which they borrowed , ' added @entity0			1
' they did n't need to spend what they spent , and therefore did n't need to borrow the amount they borrowed			0
' they forgot to pay it back , and that caused a few ripples			0
it sent a bad message			0
' @entity0 did n't confirm if @entity8 would host next year 's race despite having a contract in place historic @entity60 races are now fast falling away with @entity61 , @entity62 and now @entity2 losing their place on the calendar in recent times			1
@entity66 is another that will struggle to pay its way beyond the expiry of its current contract in 2016 unless national government steps in to assist , or @entity0 reduces his fees			1
asked whether he was prepared to see @entity7 's @entity60 heartland wither away , @entity0 said : ' there are lots of things we all would like , but we do n't have them because we ca n't afford them			2
' suggested to @entity0 ' if @entity82 goes , it goes ' , he said : ' whatever goes , goes			0
' the @entity7 supremo said @entity8 having a contract in place ' does n't make a difference ' @entity0 did concede , however , ' it would be terrible ' if @entity60 did lose all its races , particularly as the series would no longer become a world championship			1
many people believe @entity0 's hosting fees are too steep , which in turn prompts promoters to charge extortionate ticket prices , leading to reduced numbers through the turnstiles			0
@entity8 , for instance , saw its audience plummet from more than 100,000 in 2012 to just 60,000 in 2014 , despite @entity101 being a four - time world champion at that stage and @entity103 dominating last year			0
' probably right , ' said @entity0 , regarding comments about over-charging			0
' but the teams get 62 per cent of whatever profit the company ( @entity107 , who run the sport ) makes , so if we make less money , the teams make less money			0
' the @entity2 @entity1 has alternated between @entity8 and @entity31 since 2007			1

the @entity2 @entity1 was axed from this year 's @entity7 calendar
@entity8 officials failed to agree a deal to host july 's scheduled race
@entity0 says @entity2 @entity1 may miss out next year too
@entity66 is also at risk when its current contract expires in 2016
