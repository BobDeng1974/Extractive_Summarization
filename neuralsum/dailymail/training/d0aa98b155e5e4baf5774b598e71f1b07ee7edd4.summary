they say he then threw the baby , @entity35 , out of a car window on @entity37 in @entity31			0
the child was found dead along the side of the highway			1
prosecutors claimed during the trial the killing was ' the ultimate act of revenge ' against @entity26 , who had sidled up to a new man in the days before the killing , according to reports			2
the jury deliberated for about seven hours before handing down the guilty verdict in the murder charge and also on counts of kidnapping , battery and aggravated child abuse			2
the guilty verdict came despite @entity9 's public defender arguing during the trial that there was no evidence definitively showing he had thrown the baby onto the road			2
' there 's no clear explanation of how that baby got to the side of that road , ' assistant public defender @entity61 said in his closing argument , according to the @entity68			0

@entity9 's previous trial was declared a mistrial after @entity26 insisted the then - 17 - year - old man threatened to kill her son			1
it was not the first time she made the accusation			0
the victim : three - month - old @entity89 died after being thrown from a moving car on a busy @entity1 highway @entity26 's claim that her ex-boyfriend threatened to shoot her and her son and urinate on the child came up originally in a 2010 trial where @entity9 was found not guilty of battering her			1
prior to the commencement of that previous trial , the court ruled the phone call with the threat should not be introduced because it was part of a previous trial - where @entity9 was ultimately acquitted for assault - and was therefore irrelevant in the murder case			1
but @entity26 gasped out the allegation amid tears as soon as she took the stand during the eventual mistrial			2
assistant state attorney @entity109 had asked @entity26 about phone calls from @entity9 the day before @entity35 's death			1

' @entity109 acknowledged @entity26 's testimony was ' clearly ... a violation ' of the court order but he said he had not expected her to refer to the phone call , which took place about six weeks before her son 's death			2
however , he added that he had not specifically told her not to mention in their preparations for testimony			0
' it did not come up , ' @entity109 said			0
@entity9 's lawyer argued that there was not enough evidence to show his client was responsible for the baby 's death			2

@entity26 's claim that her ex-boyfriend threatened to shoot her and her son and urinate on the child came up originally in a 2010 trial where @entity9 was found not guilty of battering her			1
@entity26 is pictured , left , in 2009 tv cameraman @entity152 , who was on his way to work for a local station , said : ' just out of the corner of my eye , i thought i saw some trash on the side of the road			2
