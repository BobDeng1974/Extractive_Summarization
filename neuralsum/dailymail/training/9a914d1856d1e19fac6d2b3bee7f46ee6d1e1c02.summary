by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 30 november 2013 @entity2 : 06:55 est , 30 november 2013 it seems the spirit of @entity5 is alive and well ... in a small town in @entity7			1
council officials in @entity9 ordered the top of a 30ft christmas tree to be lopped off - because it blocked a @entity13 camera			1
the tree went up earlier this month in the town centre , reaching the dizzy heights of the 90 - year - old clock tower next door			1
pruned : the top of the @entity11 in @entity9 , @entity7 , was lopped off - because it blocked @entity13 blocked : the camera had less than a good view after a 30ft conifer was placed next to it in the town centre but the tower has a @entity13 camera placed on top - which the conifer completely blocked			1
so @entity26 had the top removed , leaving many residents scratching their heads			0
former trawlerman @entity30 , 70 , said : ' why could n't they just take a bit off the bottom before they put it up , not take the top off ? where is the star going to go ? ' they took it off because the camera could n't see the shopping precinct , ' he added			2
' it looked like about five - and - a - half foot they chopped off the top , which is a shame because it looked like the biggest tree we have had			0
the conifer was sourced from the country estate of @entity50 in @entity51 , an hour away , and transported specially to the town square			1
lopped : the clock tower , left , and former fisherman @entity30 , 70 , with the discarded top of the tree town clerk @entity56 denied there was a problem - telling regional newspaper @entity58 that the tree had been ' shaped ' so it would still have a triangle on top			2
he added : ' i would n't say it was five - and - a - half foot that was taken off			0
we sent the contractors out there with radios and they liased with the control room as to how much to take off			0
' the view of the camera was totally obscured by the tree so it had to be taken off			0
' a town of 20,000 , @entity9 is on the @entity73 and has one of the most important ports on the east coast			2
its clock tower was erected in 1926 to celebrate the town 's centenary - but sits slightly unceremoniously on a roundabout .			0

*decision* by town council left residents *perplexed* in @entity9 , @entity7
30ft tree had been sourced from a country estate and put in town centre
outraged resident , 70 , said : ' where is the star going to go ? '
