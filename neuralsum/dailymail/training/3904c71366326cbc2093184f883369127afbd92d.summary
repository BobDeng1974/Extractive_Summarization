@entity0 begin their whistlestop tour of @entity2 today when they touch down in the @entity3			1
the @entity4 will cram plenty during their four day stay : daily training sessions , fan parties , coaching clinics and saturday ’s clash against @entity12 ’s @entity11 on saturday			1
for the club , it ’s a chance to plant commercial roots in a country they are yet to crack on a big scale			0
but for the players , it ’ll be an opportunity to plant their own seeds - in manager @entity24 ’s head - ahead of the new season			1
@entity39 , for example , knows he ’ll have an integral role in @entity0 ’s trophy charge next season having established himself as the club ’s premier central midfielder			1
likewise , @entity45 knows he ’s almost certain to start the season as the club ’s first - choice left - back having seen off the challenge of @entity50			2
however , others are n’t so fortunate			0
@entity0 players @entity30 , @entity50 , @entity32 , @entity45 and @entity39 on board their flight to the @entity55 @entity30 and @entity32 are all smiles as they fly out from @entity57 and here , @entity58 takes a look at the @entity4 ’ travelling party who ’ll want to make it big in @entity62 almost certain to start the season as the club ’s no 1			1
but the imminent arrival of @entity67 from @entity68 will raise further question marks over the @entity71 ’s position as first - choice goalkeeper			0
@entity67 impressed for @entity73 during the @entity74 and will arrive in north @entity76 intent on dislodging @entity77 between the posts			2
it ’s not the first time @entity77 ’s role has come under scrutiny during his time at @entity0 , but a strong pre-season will help reinforce his position as the club ’s undisputed first - choice @entity89 the right - back may have thought his time had come when @entity91 left for @entity92 earlier this summer , but the arrival of @entity94 from @entity95 means @entity89 will play second - fiddle again			1
but it could get worse for the youngster , with @entity24 known to be in the market for another right - back			0
they have held talks over a move for @entity105 ’s @entity104 and have been linked with @entity107 right - back @entity106			0
a strong showing in @entity55 could be enough to persuade @entity24 that @entity89 can fill the role as reserve right - back			0
@entity39 boards the plane at @entity113 as @entity0 head to @entity2 @entity50 was signed by @entity0 in january 2013 as the man to replace injury - prone @entity45 as the club ’s first - choice left - back			1
however , the move has not gone as planned for the @entity119			0
@entity45 ’ form has been first - class since @entity50 ’s arrival , while those niggling injuries that have blighted his career seem to have cleared up			0
@entity50 expressed his concern at his lack of playing time to @entity24 last season and wo n’t want another year of warming the bench			2
can he breathe life into his @entity4 career here in @entity55 ? @entity132 it ’s contract time for the former @entity136 man			1
he has less than 12 months on his existing @entity0 deal leaving his future at the club uncertain			1
he wants to stay at the @entity140 and says he will talk to @entity24 in the coming weeks to clarify his future			0
talk of the club signing a new holding central midfielder will not have gone unnoticed by the @entity119			0
some strong performances in pre-season , starting against the @entity11 on saturday , could go a long way to securing his place in the starting xi … and a new contract			1
@entity24 speaks at the @entity150 in @entity29 on thursday @entity151 , knows his place in the @entity0 ’s team is under threat given the club ’s pursuit of a new central midfielder			1
having started the season well , his performances tailed off towards the end of the season			2
it is likely to be @entity39 and one other to start in central midfield next season			2
@entity30 , by nature , is more suited to a defensive game than @entity132 , though the @entity119 is a much better passer - a trait @entity24 prefers			2
a good summer campaign from @entity30 and @entity132 could be enough to convince @entity24 he already has enough in central midfield going into the new @entity170 it ’s not been the most memorable few months for the midfielder			0
he missed the majority of the final few weeks of last season with a foot injury , before playing a peripheral role in @entity178 ’s disastrous @entity74 campaign			0
and as if things could n’t get any worse , the spotlight was back on the the 22 - year - old again last week after he was photographed smoking and behaving outrageously during a summer break in @entity184			0
@entity27 is at a crossroads , he knows it and so do the @entity0 coaching team			1
competition in central midfield is fierce , but @entity27 certainly has the ability to play alongside @entity39			2
playing and training well here in @entity55 will certainly help his cause			0
@entity193 goes through his paces at the @entity0 training ground before the players flew out @entity198 @entity0 ’s forgotten man			1
the @entity4 need for a bona - fide world class holding midfielder is clear - but in @entity201 they may already have one			2
as always , the biggest obstacle towards the @entity203 playing a key role for @entity0 next season will be his fitness			1
can he stay clear of injury long enough to have a sustained run in the team ? if so , then @entity24 may not need to splash the cash on signing @entity211 , @entity212 or @entity213 .			0

@entity4 only game of the tour is against @entity11 on saturday
@entity27 posts @entity33 picture from @entity29
several @entity0 players have points to prove ahead of new season
