@entity0 , the @entity2 's @entity1 , stated that she agreed with the ruling that @entity5 's tax on @entity6 selling their holiday homes is ' illegal ' the @entity8 appears set to rule that @entity5 's tax on @entity6 selling their holiday homes is ' illegal '			1
the decision could force the @entity5 government to pay back more than £ 396million to @entity8 residents who sold or rented their second homes in the country in the last three years			1
in 2012 , roughly 200,000 @entity6 saw the capital gains tax on the sale of their second homes rise from 19 per cent to 34.5 per cent			2
the tax on rental income increased from 20 per cent to 34.5 per cent			0
this was as a result of a 15.5 per cent ' social charge ' that @entity23 's government imposed in a bid to raise some £ 200million a year			1
but there is a case that has been brought before the @entity2 whose decision might put an end to these ' social charges ' on @entity6 ' holiday homes			1
it is based on @entity34 regulation that states an individual should only be subject to the social security legislation of one member state			0
the court has previously said that an individual should only pay social contributions levied on their income in one country			2
now it must decide whether the same rules apply to social contributions imposed on assets , such as second homes			2
the @entity48 has already ruled that it considers extending these @entity5 ' social charges ' to non-residents to be against @entity8 law			1
and , in an opinion released last month , @entity0 , the @entity2 's @entity1 , stated that she agreed with the ruling			0
now a number of legal experts have stated that they think it likely the @entity2 will follow ms @entity0 's opinion			0
@entity58 , a @entity6 - based cross-border tax adviser , stated in an online post : ' it seems very likely the @entity61 when it makes its final decision shortly ( before end 2014 ) will take this view as the @entity64 is very clear in her opinion			0
' holiday home : the decision could force the country to pay back more than £ 396million to @entity8 residents who sold or rented their second homes in @entity5 in the last three years			1
( file image ) if this conclusion is reached , then @entity6 who have paid the additional ' social charge ' on a sale of a @entity5 property should be able to reclaim past payments			1
the same principle should apply to charges paid on rental income			0
but a @entity5 law passed in 2013 means that taxpayers only one year - starting from the end of the year that the social charge was paid - to claim the money			1
as a result , the period to reclaim on any social contribution paid on a property sold in 2013 expires on 31 december this year			2
britons who rented out properties in 2012 will have until the end of the year to make a claim			0
however , @entity6 based law firm @entity92 , @entity93 stressed that the rules are not entirely clear and said their might be room for the law to be interpreted more favourably .			0

britons pay 15.5 *%* ' social charge ' when renting and selling holiday homes
but @entity8 looks set to conclude that this extra contribution *violates* law
could force @entity5 to pay back more than £ 396m to second - home *owners*
