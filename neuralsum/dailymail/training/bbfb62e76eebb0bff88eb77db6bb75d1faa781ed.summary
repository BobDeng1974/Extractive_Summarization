the stones at @entity2 could have been ‘ played ’ like a giant xylophone , a study has claimed			1
researchers spent months tapping pieces of stone onto 1,000 types of rock and recording the sound they made			2
most produced a muted ‘ thud ’ , but bluestones from the @entity13 hills in south @entity14 – where the monoliths are thought to have originated – ‘ sing ’ when struck			1
singing stones : bluestones from the @entity13 hills in south @entity14 , from where @entity2 's monoliths are thought to have originated , have an ' exceptional sonic nature ' , say researchers from the @entity22 their ‘ exceptional sonic nature ’ may explain why neolithic man carted the stones 200 miles to @entity25 in @entity26 more than 4,000 years ago to build @entity2			1
it may also shed light on their circle formation , with sound resonating among the stones when they were ‘ played ’			0
the startling conclusion was the result of a study by experts at the @entity22 rather than by archaeologists			2
they were even granted access to @entity2 itself to play the structures like a giant xylophone , where they confirmed the rocks made a range of metallic sounds like bells , gongs and tin drums			2
@entity51 , who led the study with @entity52 , said : ' there had to be something special about these rocks			0
' why the hell would you take them from @entity14 all the way to @entity25 otherwise ? ' the one thing that has n’t been considered until now is that sound may have been an important factor			1
' we found it was a noteworthy soundscape , with a significant percentage of the actual rocks making metallic sounds like bells , gongs , tin drums , etc , when tapped with small , handheld " hammerstones "			0
' we have had percussionists up here who have been able to actually get proper tunes out of the rocks			0
this is real rock music			0
' spiritual site : people watch the midsummer sun as it rises over @entity2 on the @entity80 the research team tested rocks from 1,000 different locations from around the @entity84 to test their sonic abilities			1
they found that bluestones from the @entity13 hills in @entity89 , sounded like no other			1
@entity91 allowed the team to acoustically test the bluestones at @entity2 , effectively playing them like a huge instrument			1
@entity95 imagines a musical stonehenge to the researchers ’ surprise , several were found to make distinctive , if muted sounds , with several of the rocks showing evidence of having already been struck			0
the stones make different pitched noises in different places and different stones make different noises - ranging from a metallic to a wooden sound			0
the investigators believe that this could have been the prime reason behind the otherwise inexplicable transport of these stones nearly 200 miles from @entity113 to @entity25			1
there were plentiful local rocks from which @entity2 could have been built , yet the bluestones were considered special			2
large chunks of rock missing from the stones would also suggest that they have been hit throughout their lifetime			0
a spokesman for the project said it was merely a pilot study - the phenomenon of the ‘ sound of stone ’ was being investigated for virtually the first time with the project			0
he said : ' the project is a pilot study of raw visual and acoustic elements mainly on and around the @entity134 ridge , @entity13 , south - west @entity14 , the source area of some of the @entity2 bluestones , an area still relatively untouched by modern development			1
' sites in the surrounding @entity89 countryside were also briefly visited			0
' the project asked : " what might @entity143 eyes and ears have perceived in this landscape , and what aspects made it become important to the builders of @entity2 ? " ' @entity150 , who led the research , added : ' it was a really magical discovery and refreshing to come across a phenomenon you ca n’t explain			2

@entity22 researchers say that @entity13 bluestones sound like no others tested from across the country
@entity162 qualities may explain why *prehistoric* @entity84 's took them 200 miles to @entity25 to build @entity2 4,000 years ago
