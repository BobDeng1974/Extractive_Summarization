by @entity0 the @entity1 kicked off with a somewhat soggier start than hoped for , as most parts of the @entity4 woke up to washout weather			2
hopes for a sizzling summer weekend all but vanished this morning as torrential rain , thunder and even some hail spread across the country for the start of the three - day weekend			2
@entity12 and @entity13 saw some of the worst wet weather , while @entity16 recorded the highest amount of rainfall in the country - which was more than half its monthly average			1
what rain ? tourists in @entity22 did n't let the washout weather stop them from enjoying a punt along the @entity26 earlier today , as rain spread across the country for the first day of the @entity1 weekend downpours swept across the country , spelling woe for hundrerds of families wanting to celebrate the long weekend in glorious sunshine			1
the rain comes at the end of a week which has already seen ferocious thunderstorms , hail and localised floods across the south of @entity42 beaches across the country , including @entity45 , were deserted and sunbeds remained unused as people chose to stay indoors and avoid the constant downpours usually packed with sun worshippers , dog walkers and swimmers , the beach was virtually empty			0
in @entity16 , another seaside town , 28mm of rain fell - more than half the town 's monthly average @entity57 and @entity58 did n't let the cold wind and rain spoil their ice creams as they enjoyed a trip to the beach in @entity65 , @entity66			1
but the rest of the beach - usually packed at any hint of sunshine - was deserted the town recorded 28mm of rainfall , more than half the 50mm it expects per month			2
the south west of @entity42 , the south and east of @entity13 , the south of @entity42 and parts of the @entity76 also had a particularly bad dose of the wet weather			0
as the rain pelted down , beaches remained virtually empty and usually - packed lidos were deserted			0
and it seems those trying to enjoy the long weekend will have to contend with some more dismal weather conditions until monday , with the @entity87 warning that ' nowhere will be dry '			2
although the rain is expected to clear across many parts of the country later today , forecasters predict more rain tomorrow and monday , in what they have described as an ' unsettled picture '			1
swimmers shunned the outdoor pool at @entity98 , as the south west , along with the @entity76 , @entity13 and the south east , suffered some of the worst wet weather lifeguards at the @entity103 sheltered themselves under giant golf umbrellas as they watched a handful of determined swimmers brave the wet weather the grey start this morning remained in place for most of the day , although forecasters predict the rain will clear in the south of the country later this evening - before it returns again tomorrow weather experts said rain is due to ease off in the south and south east of @entity42 later this evening but that heavy rainfall would continue in the north of @entity42 and @entity118			1
scattered showers will then stick around all day tomorrow , leaving much of the country in weather limbo			1
but forecasters say there will be some sunshine on monday , with above - average temperatures predicted across the country			1
@entity127 , which is expected to be the hottest part of the country , is due to bask in @entity131 temperatures , while the south coast - particularly @entity133 and @entity134 - will also have some sunshine			1
shoppers in @entity22 propped open their brollies as they braved the bad weather , which forecasters say is due to continue over the weekend			0
although sunday and monday is not expected to be as bad as today , forecasters warned ' nowhere would be dry ' the @entity87 said it was an ' unsettled story ' for the rest of the weekend , with longer periods of rain due throughout next week but that sunshine could still be dispersed with bouts of rainy weather			1
@entity148 from the @entity87 said : ' there has been rain across most parts of the country today			0
it is not a very nice day at all			0
' and there is now a slightly more pessismistic outlook on the weather for the rest of the weekend			0
' the rain is due to ease off later today , particularly in the south and south east , but there is nowhere that can expect to be dry tomorrow			0
' unfortunately it is an unsettled story for the next few days , with longer periods of rain expected into next week			2
' the wet weather should not come as a surprise , after last week â€™s short - lived heatwave was extinguished by storms on thursday			0
temperatures up to @entity168 ( @entity169 ) were replaced by thunder , lightning and an inch of rain , causing road chaos .			0
