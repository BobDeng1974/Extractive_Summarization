the iron stimulates plankton growth , which ' binds ' carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere - getting rid of one of the gases which warms @entity9 's atmosphere			1
a trial , called @entity22 , has been hailed a success , after a bloom of plankton sank 1,000 metres below the ocean , taking with it carbon dioxide			1
at present , the technique could only be used to ' mop up ' around a tenth of global carbon emissions - but scientists continue to investigate			2
' we were able to prove that over 50 per cent of the plankton bloom sank below 1000 metre depth indicating that their carbon content can be stored in the deep ocean and in the underlying seafloor sediments for time scales of well over a century , ' says prof. dr. @entity41 from the @entity42 in the @entity43			1
previous experiments which aimed to ' bind ' carbon in this way failed			1
' such controlled iron fertilization experiments in the ocean enable us to test hypotheses and quantify processes that can not be studied in laboratory experiments			2
the results improve our understanding of processes in the ocean relevant to climate change ' says @entity41			2
' the controversy surrounding iron fertilization experiments has led to a thorough evaluation of our results before publication ' the iron stimulates plankton growth , which ' binds ' carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere - getting rid of one of the gases which warms @entity9 's atmosphere the experiments attempts to recreate conditions during previous ice ages			1
during past ice ages the air was cooler and drier than it is today and more iron - containing dust was transported from the continents to the ocean by the wind			0
the iron supply to marine phytoplankton was hence higher during the ice ages			0
this natural process is simulated in iron fertilisation experiments under controlled conditions			0
@entity85 plays an important role in the climate system			1
it is involved in many biochemical processes such as photosynthesis and is hence an essential element for biological production in the oceans and , therefore , for @entity95 absorption from the atmosphere			0
an international research team published the results of an ocean iron fertilization experiment ( @entity100 ) carried out in 2004 in the current issue of the scientific journal nature			0
unlike the @entity104 experiment carried out in 2009 , @entity100 has shown that a substantial proportion of carbon from the induced algal bloom sank to the deep sea floor			2
these results , which were thoroughly analyzed before being published now , provide a valuable contribution to our better understanding of the global carbon @entity113 international team on board the research vessel @entity116 fertilized in spring 2004 ( i.e. at the end of the summer season in the southern hemisphere ) a part of the closed core of a stable marine eddy in the @entity12 with dissolved iron , which stimulated the growth of unicellular algae ( phytoplankton )			1
the team followed the development of the phytoplankton bloom for five weeks from its start to its decline phase			0
the maximum biomass attained by the bloom was with a peak chlorophyll stock of @entity136 per square metre higher than that of blooms stimulated by the previous 12 iron fertilization experiments			0
the @entity142 ship stimulated plankton growth using iron dumped into the water according to prof. dr. @entity41 from the @entity42 in the @entity43 , this was all the more remarkable because the @entity100 bloom developed in a 100 metre deep mixed layer which is much deeper than hitherto believed to be the lower limit for bloom development.the bloom was dominated by diatoms , a group of algae that require dissolved silicon to make their shells and are known to form large , slimy aggregates with high sinking rates at the end of their blooms			1
these results contrast with those of the @entity104 experiment carried out in 2009 where diatom growth was limited by different nutrient conditions , especially the absence of dissolved silicon in the chosen eddy			0
instead , the plankton bloom consisted of other types of algae which , however , have no protective shell and were eaten more easily by zooplankton			0
' this shows how differently communities of organisms can react to the addition of iron in the ocean ' , says dr. @entity179			0
' we expect similarly detailed insights on the transportation of carbon between atmosphere , ocean and sea bottom from the further scientific analysis of the @entity104 data " , adds prof. dr. @entity189 , @entity190 at the @entity42 , who is also involved in the nature study .			2

@entity85 stimulates plankton growth
plankton bind carbon dioxide and sink it to ocean floor
tests in @entity12 hailed a success
