@entity0 was last night accused of recruiting ‘ toffs for the top ’ of @entity10 after a candidate in a key target seat expressed fury that he had been ousted in favour of a star of the tv programme @entity7			1
@entity11 , a wealthy , retired hotelier who features on the @entity13 programme , has been parachuted in as mr @entity0 ’s candidate in @entity15 and @entity16 , where the sitting @entity18 mp holds a wafer - thin majority			1
now the deposed candidate has given vent to his anger in a leaked email to local party members in which he condemns @entity10 ’s policy of recruiting defecting @entity18 mps and celebrities			1
@entity30 calls on @entity10 members to bombard mr @entity0 with complaints about his treatment , and claims that his party boasts ‘ standards of democracy lower than the unelected @entity37 ’			1
@entity51 and @entity52 have been filmed knocking back glasses of wine and champagne with mr @entity0 for a tv special which ends with the @entity10 leader falling over , smashing a glass and having to borrow a pair of his host ’s trousers			0
row : @entity30 claims that he was kicked out in favour of mr @entity11			1
he has vented his anger in an email to local @entity10 party members mr @entity11 , 55 – whose @entity7 appearances with his wife @entity66 and two of their four children have included discussions about whether @entity10 is racist – was selected for the seat last week shortly after mr @entity30 was removed in a coup which he says was orchestrated by the party ’s head office			1
in the email , seen by @entity74 , mr @entity30 complains that he has ‘ apparently been removed as @entity75 ’ , and says sarcastically , in reference to the recent by - election victories of @entity79 and @entity80 : ‘ obviously potential candidates who have defected from the @entity18 will be preferred to long - term party members			1
this is in line with party policy which is to recruit more ‘ ‘ toffs for the top ’ ’ in order to win votes from the disenfranchised working - class voters , who exist in great numbers here ’			0
mr @entity30 , a former @entity10 spokesman on immigration , adds : ‘ any person wishing to complain in a civilised fashion about this situation should send to [ he gives mr @entity0 ’s private email address ]			2
’ @entity15 , which is held by @entity18 mp @entity98 with a majority over @entity100 of under 2,000 , is number 54 on @entity10 ’s ‘ hitlist ’ of conservative - held seats			2
mr @entity11 is filmed for @entity7 at his £ 1.5 million house , which , far from being in the @entity15 constituency , is in @entity106			1
in one recent edition , mr @entity11 , who is of @entity109 - @entity108 origin , discussed the alleged racism of @entity10 ’s ‘ calypso ’ song with his family			2
at one point his children laugh sarcastically : ‘ would n’t want anyone thinking @entity10 is racist			0
’ and in another episode , mr @entity11 ’s wife @entity66 says : ‘ that @entity80 is not exactly very charismatic is he ? ’ after mr @entity11 agrees , she adds : ‘ i think if you were a donkey and you had the @entity10 rosette on , they would vote for you			2
’ favoured : mr @entity30 says , in reference to ex-tories like @entity79 ( right with mr @entity0 ) : ‘ potential candidates who have defected from the @entity18 will be preferred to long - term party members			2
' last week it was revealed that more than a dozen party activists had resigned amid complaints that mr @entity0 and his ‘ undemocratic cabal ’ had stopped long - serving @entity10 members from standing as @entity131 in winnable seats			0
last night , a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ it is @entity10 policy that candidates in target seats are verified by the @entity137			0
in the case of @entity15 , it was felt the candidate was not suitable			0
‘ nobody was preferred by the party			0
@entity15 has now selected mr @entity11			0
this has nothing to do with mr @entity0 ’s filming with the @entity7 team , which took place months ago and was unrelated			0
