by @entity0 @entity1 is a regular on @entity2 , using it as a platform to share such gems as ' remember , we are all water in the same ocean '			1
and while her 4.7million followers may smile wryly at her more mystical offerings , one , in particular , is driven mad by them			0
@entity12 coach @entity11 has taken to mocking @entity14 's widow on @entity2 , retweeting her thoughts and adding jokes of her own			1
barely a day goes past on the social network without the mother of @entity20 champion @entity19 making a jokey comeback to the 81 - year - old @entity22			1
musings : @entity1 's mystical messages on @entity2 are relentlessly mocked by tennis coach , @entity11 not impressed : @entity11 , 54 , replies in typical fashion to one of the @entity22 's messages on @entity2 ' give us peace springs to mind ' : @entity19 seems unmoved by the pacifist 's thoughtful messages of peace not smiliing : @entity19 , who is from @entity35 , has no truck for another of @entity1 's more spiritual pronouncements earlier this week , @entity1 posted on @entity2 : ' clean up the water inside your body			1
let 's be the oasis for the world			0
' even if you do n't announce it , it will be felt by the whole world '			0
@entity19 , 54 , was clearly at the end of her tether when she replied : ' face			2
hours before , @entity1 had tweeted : ' @entity53 , spread peace and tell your friends to imagine peace '			2
to which @entity19 , from @entity35 , replied : ' mmm			2
give us peace springs to mind '			0
when @entity1 tweeted : ' send a friend a photo that says " smile " or a picture , a story or a piece of pie , but specify it 's a smile ur passing on ' , @entity19 tweeted back : ' yes dear '			1
taunting : the mother of wimbledon tennis champion , @entity19 , finds @entity1 's tricks do n't work for her ' what is beauty ? ' @entity19 's tweets demonstrate not only a sharp sense of humour but also a surprising love of cakes ' course we will ' : the @entity80 and mother of two has little patience for @entity1 's most unlikely suggestions and when @entity1 wrote : ' attach a card saying @entity85 to the room and / or object you wish to transform ' , @entity19 replied : ' did it ...			1
what now ? ' @entity1 , mother of @entity91 by her first husband , @entity92 , and of @entity93 by the @entity94 , has not yet replied to the taunts by the @entity80			2
indeed , she seems to derive great comfort from @entity2 , tweeting recently : ' a big hug + kiss to each one of you			0
i feel privileged to share this time with you			0
' thank you for being in my life			0
' @entity19 , who has 94,500 followers on @entity2 , replied : ' @entity105			1
' her tweets demonstrate a humour many of had not suspected the mother of the steely - jawed tennis star possessed			2
running out of patience : the @entity22 comes up with ideas of how her followers can explore spirituality not on the same wavelength : @entity1 's more philosophical musings are not enjoyed by the dour @entity11 thoughts for the day : @entity1 tweeted these two suggestions for her 4.68million followers earlier this month when @entity1 wrote : ' this is a piece of sky			1
after 10 years we will get together and put the sky back into one piece ' , @entity19 immediately retorted : ' course we will			0
' but she is n't always so charitable			0
in response to @entity1 's suggestion : ' get a telephone that only echoes back your voice			0
call every day and talk about many things ' , @entity19 wrote : ' first sign of madness '			0
and when @entity1 wrote : ' i think it 's impossible to see a chair as it it ' , an impatient @entity19 replied : ' four legs , a seat and a back rest			1
what 's not to see ? ' good idea : @entity1 , who is 81 , also tweets photographs of herself overlooking the sea or lakes let it be : the widow of @entity14 is an enthusiastic tweeter , often sharing messages of peace online @entity1 has two children ; @entity91 from her first marriage , and @entity93 by @entity94 @entity14 a very few @entity1 musings go unremarked , such as : ' make a sculpture to put on a mountain for people to see with telescopes			1
' another tweet the tennis coach may have missed was : ' next time you meet a foreigner , remember it 's only like a window with a different shape to it and the person who 's sitting inside is you			1
' while @entity1 has yet to reply to @entity19 , her enthusiasm for @entity2 continues unabated			1
already this week she has reminded her followers that it was @entity175 in @entity176 , and encouraged them to ' be playful - dance with your mind and body '			0
it is likely that at least one of her followers wo n't be taking her up on it			0
no - nonsense : straight - talking @entity11 is widely credited as being a driving force behind her son 's tennis success			2

@entity11 , 54 , often mocks @entity2 messages posted by @entity1 , 81
the tennis coach has no time for spiritual tweets posted by peace *activist*
typical @entity1 tweets *include* : ' remember , we are all water in the same ocean '
*scathing* @entity199 retweets @entity22 's messages - with added jokes
@entity1 , who has 4.68million followers to @entity19 's 94,000 , has never replied
