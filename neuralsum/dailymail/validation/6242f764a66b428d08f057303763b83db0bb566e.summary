the perfect end to a rewarding week			2
@entity2 ’s five - day stay in the @entity3 finished with a win that enhanced their credentials for summer success			2
@entity2 went @entity7 on monday to familiarise themselves with the place they will call home and under - 21 head coach @entity10 was thrilled with how the experiment went			1
he was even happier , then , after @entity13 ’s goal in @entity14 chiselled out victory for a much - changed side			1
having flattened inferior opponents in qualifying for @entity19 , @entity10 was keen to see how his squad will fare against better nations and so far , it has gone how he wanted			1
@entity22 – who will be opponents in @entity24 – were beaten in november and now the hosts have gone the same way			2
@entity13 celebrates his goal during the international match between @entity29 and @entity30 though this performance against the host nation was not the flashiest but it had showed qualities that @entity2 will need if they are to go all the way			1
more than anything , it proved there is strength a depth beneath the core			2
‘ i thought we did some very good things , ’ @entity10 noted			1
‘ there were also plenty of things we can improve on			0
the @entity46 are a good side and they put us under pressure but we still wanted to play the same way			2
it was a good test			0
’ there were four debutants in this experimental line - up , most notably @entity53 defender @entity52 , and for periods in the first half @entity2 lacked the cohesion of a team that has played regularly together			1
as an attacking force , they offered little			0
the @entity2 under 21 squad celebrate as they take the lead against @entity3 on friday night one thing , though , that was not in question was their fight to keep the @entity46 at bay			0
nobody embodied the spirit more than @entity13 – whom @entity10 called a ' super footballer ' – who was well placed in the 29th minute to kick a header from @entity73 striker @entity72 off the line			1
@entity10 anticipated this being a game when @entity2 would have a lot of the ball and be on the front foot but the opposite was true ; the physically strong @entity46 kept pushing @entity2 further and further back and the visitors ’ passing was not sharp as it can be at their most fluent			1
it was clear from looking at @entity10 ’s demeanour he was not happy with what he was seeing			1
he strode purposely down the tunnel at the interval and whatever he said worked as @entity2 re-emerged purpose			0
@entity30 ace @entity89 skips over @entity3 star @entity90 during the game at @entity92 they were immediately aggressive and within three minutes , they had taken the lead			1
@entity96 surged forward and zipped in a cross that @entity98 – the @entity99 defender on loan at @entity101 – failed to clear and @entity13 took advantage , sweeping in from eight yards			1
here was another indication of his tenacity : he took a heavy blow to the ankle when scoring his first international goal since august 2013 and hobbled away as his team - mates raced over to him ; the @entity111 midfielder managed just another five minutes before his night ended			1
‘ we think he will be ok for monday , ’ said @entity10			1
‘ he just caught his ankle a bit			0
but he produced a real captain ’s performance			0
he is at a club that really suits the way he plays and is developing physically			0
there is no reason why he ca n’t score more goals			0
’ @entity123 looks to beat @entity29 ace @entity124 at @entity92 in @entity14 his replacement , @entity127 ’s @entity126 , almost made an immediate impression when skipping past a number of challenges to set up @entity89 but , somehow , a posse of red shirts managed to smuggle the ball away from danger			2
with the bit between their teeth , @entity2 looked for a second but ultimately , they could not find a way through and in the final 20 minutes they were penned back			0
that they came through it was thanks to an outstanding cameo from @entity143 defender @entity141			0
so another test has been passed and now @entity145 await on monday			0
negotiate that and @entity2 really will start to dream			0
‘ this was a game we needed with small margins , ’ said @entity10			2
‘ we enjoyed qualifying but we are playing real football now			0
’ @entity10 described @entity2 's win as ' real football ' following their narrow victory on friday night			1

@entity13 secured victory for a much - changed @entity30 side
four players made their debuts in @entity10 's experimental line - up
but it was @entity164 midfielder @entity13 that proved the *difference*
hosts came close when @entity73 's @entity72 had *effort* cleared off line
