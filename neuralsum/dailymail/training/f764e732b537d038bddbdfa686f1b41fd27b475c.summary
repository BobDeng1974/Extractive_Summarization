a builder dumped twice by an @entity2 bride who used him to get a @entity5 visa has denied being @entity5 ’s most gullible groom as he prepared to marry a second @entity8 beauty			2
@entity9 , 58 , was dumped by @entity10 the day after she got her hands on a spouse ’s visa following their wedding			1
amazingly , when she turned up at his door begging for help getting her daughter into @entity5 - heartbroken @entity9 took her back			1
but the day after he secured her daughter ’s visa @entity10 left him for the second time and has never returned			1
déjà vu : @entity9 , 58 , with his ex-wife @entity23 on their wedding day in @entity8 in october 2008 , right , and , left , with new fiancee @entity26 , 26 , who he met on an @entity2 dating website the cheated brickie later learned she was already married and had lied about her age - telling him she was 34 when she was 40			1
mr @entity9 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , now suspects the whole wedding was a scam and that many of the guests were actors brought in to dupe him			1
but despite his experience , mr @entity9 is now engaged to @entity8 @entity26 , 26 , who he has known for four months after they met on an @entity2 dating website			1
he is so besotted he has already moved his lover out of the slum she was living in to a luxury flat in @entity8			0
happy : mr @entity9 is so besotted with miss @entity26 he has already moved her out of the slum she was living in to a luxury flat in @entity8 mr @entity9 is also paying for all of her food and clothes and school fees for her daughter ’s private education			1
his worried family believe he is falling for exactly the same trick again and are panicking about him switching continents to be with her			0
but the love - blind @entity52 denied being gullible and declared : ' this time it ’s love			2
' he said : ' i ca n’t wait to marry @entity26			2
we spend hours a day talking and miss each other so much			0
she ’s the woman of my dreams and is perfect for me			0
' i know people might think i ’m being taken for a ride , especially after my last experience , but @entity26 is completely different to @entity10 and i know this is the real deal			2
' he added : ' when @entity10 left me i felt completely betrayed			2
she lied about everything - even telling me she was 34 when she was actually 40			0
awkward : when first wife @entity10 , left , walked out on mr @entity9 the builder found out she was already married and had lied about her age , telling him she was 34 when she was 40 ' i was stupid to take her back , but i felt sorry for her daughter			1
it is very hard to refuse to help when you are hearing horrific stories about what is happening to a young girl			0
' i can see now that she only wanted her daughter in the @entity5 so the authorities could not throw her out if @entity75 was in full - time education			2
' the difference is i spent every day with @entity26 for seven weeks and i know her much better			2
i have met her friends - i only met one of @entity10 ’s friends			2
' @entity26 is not a risk as she has no desire to move to the @entity5			0
she just wants me to stay in @entity8 with her			0
' i ’ve fallen out with my mum and my close friends about emigrating - it ’s hard as they do n’t want me to get hurt again			0
second time lucky ? mr @entity9 then fell foul of @entity10 again when she begged him to take her back so her daughter @entity75 could get a visa			1
he did and then she left ' but this is my future happiness			0
' mr @entity9 met @entity10 in 2008 after his @entity8 friend @entity92 showed him a picture of her and revealed she wanted an @entity95 man			1
after a brief phone chat mr @entity9 flew out to see @entity10 and felt a ' connection ' - even though she did n’t speak @entity95			1
he proposed to her on a restaurant balcony on his fourth day in @entity8 on may 16 , 2008			0
he shelled out £ 5,000 on the ceremony in @entity8 on october 25 , 2008 and bought @entity10 a six - month visiting visa so they could fly back to @entity102 in november			1
the couple then went back to @entity8 on april 13 , 2009 , after mr @entity9 had raised the money for a spouse 's visa			1
i 've done it : @entity10 , pictured with her daughter @entity75 , makes a quick call possibly to mr @entity9 's friend @entity92 who the builder believes she was already married to @entity112 : @entity10 put that she was a ' business woman ' on the couple 's marriage certificate he came back to the @entity5 on may 13 , and @entity10 arrived back on may 30 , but by august 6 she had disappeared			1
but forgiving mr @entity9 rekindled their romance when @entity10 turned up at his house in may 2010 begging him to help bring her 18 - year - old daughter , @entity75 , over to the @entity5			1
but after mr @entity9 helped @entity75 gain temporary access to the @entity5 , in august , @entity10 and her daughter disappeared and have not been seen since			1
still in search of true love mr @entity9 met his new @entity2 fiancee @entity26 on dating website @entity125 and flew out to spend seven weeks with her in december 2011			1
devoted mr @entity9 moved @entity26 out of a shack in a dangerous slum and she now lives in his flat at a cost of £ 140 a month			1
he also says he pays £ 25 a week for food and bills as well as the school fees for @entity26 ’s daughter			2
sure thing : mr @entity9 said he has fallen out with his family over his upcoming nuptials to @entity138 and his intention to immigrate to @entity8 to be with her he proposed on @entity140 and he is moving to @entity8 to live with her and set up a charity and a security business			1
mr @entity9 said : ' @entity26 and i have lead completely different lives , but we have a deep understanding of each other			1
' we talk about everything that has happened to me and her life as an orphan - our hardships bring us together			0
' she loves me so much and we message each other at least 20 times a day on @entity155			0
sometimes i wish i had never got involved in all this , but then i would not have met @entity26			0
' i am finally living a real - life love story			1
' mr @entity9 now believes @entity10 was already married to his best friend and house mate @entity92 - who introduced them			1
he claimed she was living with a 70 - year - old man in @entity162 , @entity163 , when they split and is now living illegally in the @entity5 as her visa ran out on august 13 , 2010			2
he has now been told by @entity8 and @entity5 authorities that the documents used by @entity10 for their marriage were fake so it is void and he is free to marry his fiancee			2
a spokesman from the @entity172 said they were aware of the case			0
he said : ' @entity172 will investigate all allegations of immigration crime and will take action when it is considered necessary			0
” @entity178 said : " i refute the allegation that i only married @entity9 to gain the right to live in @entity5			0
this was not the true basis of our relationship , which i considered entirely genuine in every respect			0
" because our relationship broke down i chose to leave him			0
" we were reconciled in the hope of making our marriage work			0
" unfortunately , his behaviour - in my opinion - meant i was unable to stay living with him and the relationship broke down again			0
" i refute any allegations of wrong - doing and wish to state my legal right to live and work in @entity5 and raise my daughter peacefully			0
" @entity92 and @entity26 were all unavailable for comment .			0

@entity9 was dumped by @entity10 the day after she received spouse ’s visa following their wedding

mr @entity9 says he is now living a ' true - love story ' with new fiancee @entity26
