by @entity0 published : 09:53 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 16:54 est , 28 september 2012 @entity1 is taking a small step toward becoming an e-commerce platform by launching a feature for users to buy and send real gifts - some of them worth as much as hundreds of dollars			1
as of thursday , users can purchase and ship products from more than a hundred ' @entity11 ' vendors with a few clicks on the company 's website			0
the products are only available in some @entity17 cities and only to people randomly selected by @entity1 to be ' beta users ' , but perhaps gives some indication how @entity1 intends to evolve			1
coming four months after @entity1 's troubled initial public offering , the feature marks the company 's attempt to unlock a potentially significant new revenue stream			2
although it has sought to diversify its income sources , @entity1 still relies heavily on display advertising			0
during the second quarter , more than 80 percent of its revenue of $ 1.18 billion came from ads while roughly 15 percent came from game - maker @entity46 @entity1 , which can store credit card data for users , will make money by taking a cut of each gift transaction			1
fancy a gift while you vhat ? teddy bears are one of the gifts available on @entity1 the amount varies based on the individual deals it has struck with vendor partners , the company said without disclosing specifics			1
the world 's no. 1 social network , boasting nearly 1 billion user accounts , has long viewed commercial transactions as a massive opportunity for the platform			1
but marketing researchers have found that consumers have been slow to make purchases on the website because many treat it as a place to chat and post messages rather than go shopping			0
@entity1 hopes to change that by getting users used to the idea of giving small gifts as part of their social routine			1
" people already use @entity1 to communicate with their friends and share all of their life moments , " said @entity86 , a @entity1 product manager heading the gifts feature			1
" gifting is just a natural extension of that behavior			0
it makes a lot of sense for us not to just say ' @entity98 ' but to send a gift , not just say ' i love you ' but send some flowers			0
" current gifts cost $ 5 up to several hundred dollars for a @entity105 stereo by @entity106 , said @entity86 , who joined the company in may			0
his previous start - up , @entity109 , was acquired by @entity1 in a deal announced on the day of @entity1 's high - profile ipo			1
@entity1 had experimented with a " virtual " gift - exchange feature years ago , but shut it down in 2010			2
the original gifts were no more than digital trinkets , cartoon images of flower bouquets , teddy bears and even women 's underwear			0
@entity86 said @entity1 now aims to provide effortless shopping and shipping of real goods			2
users are alerted when their packages are shipped and received , and every package comes with a customizable card stamped with a @entity1 logo			2
recipients who do not like their gifts can discreetly swap colors or sizes for no charge			0
" we think we can make an end - to - end way to buy a product that is very seamless , " @entity86 said			0
" we take care in the photos , in the packaging , in everything			0
" the service will be initially available to a random group of @entity17 users logging into @entity1 through its website and an @entity145 app. an @entity147 app is still in development , @entity86 said .			1

@entity151 *sub-set* of users are offered ' gifts ' service as @entity1 tries out real - world transactions
could be first step toward the social network allowing people to shop directly from the site
