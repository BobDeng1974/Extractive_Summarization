@entity0 is slashing the price of 1,200 everyday food essentials by up to 60 per cent , triggering a bloody price war that will force rivals to follow suit			1
the move by @entity8 ’s fourth biggest supermarket is part of a £ 1billion plan to permanently reduce prices in a bid to see off the threat posed by budget rivals @entity15 and @entity16			1
however , the price re-set will also drag the other members of the grocery big four – @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 ’s – into the fray			1
the move by @entity8 's fourth biggest supermarket is part of a £ 1billion plan to permanently reduce prices in a bid to see off the threat posed by budget rivals @entity15 and @entity16 all these rivals have price pledges which means they will have to match – or beat – the reductions offered by @entity0 if they want to keep their promises to shoppers			1
the price cuts represent a huge gamble for @entity0 , however bosses see a permanent shift to discount prices as the only way to reverse a long running fall in shopper numbers , sales and profits			1
the fall - out of the battle for customers means that millions are in line to see significant savings which should hasten the end of a five year cost of living squeeze that has brought real hardship			0
the average price cut on the 1,200 lines is 17per cent , however a number of high profile products are down by between 25per cent and 60per cent			1
@entity0 @entity60 butter is down by a third from £ 1.49 to £ 1 , its 500g packs of beef mince are down by 20per cent , bacon by 15per cent , @entity56 wipes by 60per cent and an eight - pack of @entity62 by 40per cent			1
one former executive has warned that the change in strategy is so serious for @entity0 ’ finances and future that it has become a ‘ supertanker headed towards an iceberg ’			0
if that is the case , it may well also drag down its much bigger rivals by forcing them to accept lower prices and profits for years to come			1
the chief executive , @entity77 first announced a shift to permanent low prices in march , however the chain is now putting flesh on to the bones of its initiative			2
@entity0 chief executive @entity77 , pictured , said : ' we 're serious about getting cheaper and setting new standards in transparency of pricing ' he said : ‘ @entity0 is now cheaper			0
we are cutting prices not corners			2
we are making great food even more affordable and , in doing so , giving more reasons for customers to shop with us			2
’ in the past , all the major supermarkets have launched price cut promotions , boasting of bigger and better offers			2
however , these have often not offered the savings claimed , leaving shoppers sceptical and confused			0
@entity0 is to challenge this problem by launching a website in may that will show the price history of products on its shelves to offer reassurances that they are showing genuine reductions			2
mr @entity77 said : ‘ we ’re serious about getting cheaper and setting new standards in transparency of pricing			0
' we are cutting prices not corners ' - chief executive @entity77 ' we want our customers to be proud of the products they buy and be reassured that they are cheaper			2
we have nothing to hide			0
’ the chain will back up the cuts by a new marketing campaign under the strapline ‘ i ’m @entity0 ’			2
the first tv commercials will run tonight around @entity121 and @entity122			0
@entity0 has an advantage over some of its big name rivals in that it processes and manufacturers a lot of food it sells , rather than relying on third party suppliers			1
the firm said : ‘ we will be leveraging this vertically integrated structure to control to quality of products and to keep prices down , cost which competitors will find it hard to match			0
’ city analysts have long predicted that only significant price cuts by the ‘ big four ’ stores will allow them to fend off the challenge of the @entity145 budget chains @entity15 and @entity16			1
recent industry figures show @entity15 sales rising at 35.3per cent a year , while those at @entity16 are up 17.2per cent as both make a concerted effort to expand and move into @entity8 towns by contrast , sales at @entity0 were down by 3.8per cent on a year ago , @entity21 by 3per cent , @entity23 ’s by 1.7per cent and @entity22 , which is owned by @entity153 of the @entity154 by 0.5per cent			1
the price cuts represent a huge gamble for @entity0 , however bosses see a permanent shift to discount prices as the only way to reverse a long running fall in shopper numbers , sales and profits earlier this year , @entity0 dismayed @entity166 analysts with a report of a pre-tax loss of £ 176million for the year to february 2 , compared with a pre-tax profit of £ 879m the year before			1
turnover fell by 2per cent to £ 17.7bn			1
the firm has suffered because it was late to follow rivals and open smaller convenience stores , while it delayed launching an internet grocery service			0
it is now addressing these , while it has also signed an expensive advertising deal featuring @entity178 and dec. the @entity0 change to prices is enormously risky and controversial			0
former executive , @entity181 , a property director with the supermarket for 22 years until 2009 , recently claimed that the chief executive , mr @entity77 , was ‘ out of his depth ’ , while he said the chairman , sir @entity184 , should stand down			0
it has emerged that he wrote a letter to sir @entity184 spelling out his ‘ increasing sadness at the unarguable decline of the company i helped build ’ , while he suggested it was a supertanker heading for an iceberg			0
the chain described his attacks as ‘ unhelpful ’ and ‘ unwelcome ’ and suggested mr @entity181 should take some responsibility for the problems the current management are wrestling with			0
a source said : ‘ he might be better served taking more of a thoughtful view of his role as a director of a board that left @entity0 , uniquely amongst the big grocers , with no online and no convenience offer			0
