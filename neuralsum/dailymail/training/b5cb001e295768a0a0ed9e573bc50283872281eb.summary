by @entity1 reporter published : 14:25 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 18:51 est , 23 january 2014 a miniature train that has ferried passengers around @entity6 ’s @entity5 for nearly 50 years smashed into a car on sunday			1
video shows the car sitting on the tracks just in front of the oncoming train near the @entity13			2
and while the train is small , it appeared to pack a punch as it nearly flipped the car over			0
at one third the size of an old steam train , the replica 1863 @entity30 does n’t look all that daunting			0
but the owners of a gold @entity21 are no doubt wishing they ’d had more respect for the locomotive ’s power			1
thankfully , no one was injured in the collision , but one man can be heard calmly telling fellow passengers to ‘ hold on , ’ prior to impact			0
one child ’s well - timed groan at the end of the video sums up the experience appropriately			0
hear the train a'comin ' ? a passenger happened to be recording a video just as the train made its way around a bend ' hold on ... ' : after the bend , a car can clearly be seen sitting directly atop the tracks			1
the passenger reactions make clear they see the impending collision , but they are n't exactly terrified screams impact : the train smashes into the car and is powerful enough to upend up end it			2

the train has made loops around @entity6 's @entity5 for nearly 50 years but a @entity21 could n't seem to get out of the way
