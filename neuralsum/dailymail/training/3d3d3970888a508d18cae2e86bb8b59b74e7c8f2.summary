when the treasures of @entity2 were unearthed in the 18th century , you might imagine that archaeologists would have been keen to show off their finds , which revolutionised modern understanding of the @entity7 world			1
but one part of the collection was hidden away for nearly 200 years - the erotic art which was a central part of everyday life as it adorned the houses of local citizens			1
and even now , the sexually explicit material with embarrassed its discoverers is kept in a so - called ' secret cabinet ' separate from the rest of the material discovered in @entity2 and neighbouring @entity19			1
warning : explicit content explicit : this statue of @entity23 having sex with a goat is one of the obscene statues in the ' @entity28 ' graphic : paintings from @entity2 like this caused huge embarrassment when they were discovered by archaeologists in the 18th and 19th centuries the material exhibited in the @entity28 in @entity35 is an extraordinary witness to the role that erotica played in the life of the @entity40 , as preserved by the eruption of @entity42 in 79 ad			1
frescoes considered to be great works of art frequently contain depictions of naked men and women , while nude statues are also commonplace			0
even more shocking from the modern point of view are phallic symbols which could be seen all around the cities , including penis - shaped oil lamps and wind chimes thought to bring good luck			0
perhaps the best - known item in the @entity28 is a statue of the god @entity23 having sex with a goat , which was featured in an exhibition on @entity2 in the @entity62 earlier this year			1
secret : the explicit artefacts were locked in a separate museum which was closed to women and the young commonplace : nude statues and paintings were considered normal in ancient @entity69 , but later generations were scandalised by them @entity2 was first excavated in the 1748 , but it was not until the following century that the findings were catalogued and taken to museums			1
the extraordinary trove of erotica was a great embarrassment to scholars of the @entity80 era , when public depictions of sex were entirely taboo			0
king @entity83 visited the collection in 1819 - and he was so scandalised that he ordered the sexually explicit items to be locked away in a separate museum which could be accessed only by scholars			2
the material was described in a @entity90 catalogue which circulated around @entity91 , despite the best efforts of the authorities to suppress it , and attracted the attention of young aristocrats embarking on the ' @entity97 '			0
beautiful : but extraordinary works of art were condemned as obscene by 19th - century scholars however , the offending objects were bricked off from women and young people , while explicit frescoes could only be glimpsed through metal shutters			0
it was not until 2000 that the @entity108 was fully opened to the public - it now forms part of the @entity112			2
@entity35 is not the only museum to have hosted a ' secret ' collection of obscene antiquities - the @entity62 once held all sexually explicit items in a ' @entity117 ' closed to the general public			2
good luck : these clay objects were considered to bring fortune to their owners			0

erotic paintings and *sculptures* were part of everyday life in @entity2
but when the artefacts were *rediscovered* they were kept out of sight
items were placed in ' @entity134 ' and hidden until 2000
