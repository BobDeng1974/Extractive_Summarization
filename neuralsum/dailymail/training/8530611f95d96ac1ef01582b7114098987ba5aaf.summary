@entity0 has taken a fresh swipe at the @entity3 government – ridiculing its ' nonsense ' rule stopping people working more than 35 hours a week			1
the prime minister said the @entity3 ' obsession ' with the policy was to blame for the country 's unemployment crisis – with more than 10 per cent of the population out of work , while the @entity15 's jobless rate has plummeted to just 6.2 per cent			1
mr @entity0 's jibe , which will spark fury in @entity18 , comes after the @entity19 predicted @entity20 would overtake @entity3 to become the second - biggest economy in @entity22 next year			1
the prime minister said people who did not feel ' in any way mega-rich ' were being hit by the tax			0
he told a gathering of pensioners and older workers that people should be able to pass their family home to their children ' rather than leave it to the taxman '			0
inheritance tax is levied at a rate of 40 per cent on the value of an estate above the £ 325,000 threshold - with married couples able effectively to combine their allowances to £ 650,000			0
the @entity52 had promised to raise the threshold to £ 1million , but the policy failed to make the coalition agreement with the @entity56 when the government took office in 2010 - with the priority given to raising the personal income tax allowance instead			2
but the prime minister said today he would like to see ' more progress ' on the issue , adding that chancellor @entity64 was ' keen ' to address it			0
he said : ' to me inheritance tax is a tax that should be paid by the very wealthy			0
i think you should be able to pass a family home on to your children rather than leave it to the taxman			0
' he said he had ambitions to go beyond the current £ 650,000 threshold for couples			0
the @entity15 economy is expected to grow by 3.2 per cent this year and 2.7 per cent in 2015 , compared with just 0.4 per cent and 1 per cent in @entity3			1
mr @entity0 has made a habit of criticising @entity3 following @entity80 's election as president in 2012			1
just weeks after mr @entity80 's election victory the prime minister said he would ' roll out the red carpet ' for @entity3 companies fleeing his proposed 75 per cent tax on millionaires			1
and earlier this year mr @entity0 mr @entity0 made a thinly - veiled dig at mr @entity80 's economic record – criticising governments pursuing policies which would lead to ' more borrowing , more spending and more debt '			1
he said countries following this approach were seeing ' increasing unemployment , industrial stagnation and enterprise in free fall '			2
mr @entity0 's latest swipe comes after the chief @entity102 told a group of young entrepreneurs last thursday that ' @entity3 is finished ' and was ' sclerotic , hopeless and downbeat '			1
in the prime minister 's latest assault on @entity3 today , he said the 35 hour week had resulted in lower investment and an unemployment rate far in excess of the @entity15 's			1
mr @entity0 said @entity3 was in danger of falling for the ' nonsense ' idea that there were a fixed number of jobs in the economy and that a 35 - hour week would help share the work around			1
he acknowledged it was ' very dangerous ' to point a finger at a fellow @entity22 country , but launched an attack on the policy which has remained in place under socialist president @entity80 - despite calls for reform from within his own administration			2
mr @entity0 launched his attack on the @entity3 employment model while responding to questions from pensioners and older workers at @entity15 's @entity27 head office			1
he was asked about prejudice against over- 50s in the workplace and how some older workers felt pressured to retire to make way for a new generation			0
but mr @entity0 said : ' people feeling guilty that they are somehow hogging a job that could otherwise be available to a young person ? i just think we should have no truck with that argument at all			1
' the idea - economists would call it the lump of labour fallacy - the idea that there is just a fixed number of jobs and all you have got to do is try and divide them up between young people , old people , males , females - i think it 's nonsense			2
' what we have demonstrated in the last four years , and of course it 's been a difficult time economically for many , we have demonstrated that you can create millions more jobs			0
there are 1.8 million more people in work today than when i became prime minister			0
' if we had sat there in 2010 and said ' it 's going to be tough , we are not going to get any more jobs , let 's just carve them up and tell some people to retire early ' i think that would have been a terrible mistake			0
' unemployment in the @entity15 has fallen steadily since 2011 , while @entity3 has seen its jobless rate spike the @entity20 economy recorded better growth than @entity3 last year - and is predicted to pull away from its continental rival this year and next he then set his sights on the economy across the channel , telling the audience : ' very dangerous to ever point a finger at another @entity22 country but i sometimes think the @entity3 , with their obsession with the 35 - hour working week , they are falling into the danger of a lump of labour fallacy , where ' if only everyone just worked 35 hours there would be more work to go round '			1
' i think what you have seen is that results in higher unemployment , less competitive industry , fewer people wanting to invest in your economy			2
' that 's why the rates of unemployment in @entity3 and in @entity20 are so different			2
ours is way , way below theirs			0
' mr @entity0 said there should not be a stigma about employing older people , saying some companies such as @entity216 chain @entity215 were ' doing amazing work '			2
he added : ' the truth is fewer and fewer of us are going to start a job aged 21 and work through that job for the rest of our lives			0
training and on the job training and continuous training is going to be part of people 's lives , and that should be the case for people in their 50s and 60s as well			0
