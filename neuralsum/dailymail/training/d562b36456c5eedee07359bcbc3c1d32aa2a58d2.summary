in a statement they said : ' in the last 48 hours we received the exceptionally sad news that our son @entity1 has died whilst travelling in @entity4			1
' we are being informed of the circumstances through the @entity39			0
' we understand that he took part in a local tribal ritual recommended by the hostel that he was staying at			1
' the ritual involves a drink made from local plant infusions			1
we are awaiting further information from the @entity39 but it is likely that a reaction to this drink was the cause			2
' @entity1 was an adventurous person who travelled extensively			1
he was polite , popular with a great sense of humour and was very much loved by his family and his many friends			1
' we hope we can all be given the time and space to come to terms with what has happened and to grieve for our son and brother			0
' a @entity63 user also paid tribute to the student			0
she posted : ' so sad			0
' many of his friends changed their profile pictures on @entity71 to one of them with @entity1			2
it is thought he attended @entity73 and had accepted a place at the @entity75 to study at the school of @entity77			1
after trying the drug for the first time , the student decided to stay at the hostel to take it again and collapsed on the second occasion			0
hours later @entity1 's body was dumped on a remote dirt track			1
@entity1 , from @entity23 , had been travelling round @entity16 for some months , but only recently arrived in the remote town of @entity106 in the @entity107			1
around a week ago he booked in to the @entity109 hostel there			0
the hostel continues to list the taking of the potentially lethal hallucinogen on its ' things to do ' web page , saying : ' experience @entity2 , @entity117 tradition taking a medicinal plant which purifies and can make you hallucinate '			2
however the owners maintain that they did not encourage @entity1 to take the drug			2
@entity2 , or @entity2 , contains @entity122 , or @entity122			2
it is a plant - based mixture that can also be smoked to give users a hallucinatory ' journey ' more extreme than that of @entity127 , ketamine or magic mushrooms			0
@entity130 , founder of the @entity131 , claims it has ' a larger proportion of new users ' compared to other powerful drugs			0
according to the 2012 study , conducted between november and december last year , @entity122 offers an ' extreme hallucinatory experience ' and users cite a ' bad trip ' as a potential risk			0
the majority of users rated the effect of @entity122 as stronger than ketamine , magic mushrooms and @entity127 they added that the reaction was a ' journey ' rather than a trip because the experience stands apart from anything else			0
the young @entity150 , who appears to have been travelling alone but had made friends on his travels , first drank the drug on sunday without suffering apparent harm , then took it again on tuesday			0
@entity1 travelled a short distance from his hostel to take the drug on the land of a shaman named as @entity160 from the @entity162 tribe , among a small group of other tourists from around the world			1
there was one local report that @entity1 fell unconscious at around 3am on wednesday morning , and that attempts were made to revive him with a nettle ointment said to be an antidote to @entity2			1
one source was reported as telling a local @entity11 news site : ' a couple of people die every year from taking @entity2			2
i ca n't say very much as there is a police investigation			0
' @entity1 was a very decent polite young man who looked more like a student than a hippy			1
he was not the sort of person you would expect that would take @entity2			2
' the source added that @entity1 , who was travelling alone but had met others on his south @entity16 journey , may have been talked into taking the potentially lethal herbal cocktail			2
he revealed that @entity1 took part in the drug taking ritual twice while he was in @entity106 , with just one day between sessions , and ' was planning to travel on but changed his mind to go and take it again '			1
the process is said to take around 24 hours , and involves a number of processes which require the user to dress in white			0
investigators from the @entity11 attorney general 's office removed the body to @entity106 to establish the cause of death			0
a @entity7 @entity39 spokesperson said : ' we are aware of the death of a @entity7 national on 23 april in @entity4			0
