by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is set to confirm that he will be continuing his groundbreaking coaching arrangement with @entity4 , despite his untimely quarter final exit from @entity6 earlier this month			1
@entity2 is more than a week into his mid-season training block in @entity8 and the 35 year - old former women ’s number one has joined him as he prepares for next month ’s hard court events leading into the @entity12			1
he is likely to end speculation by announcing in the next few days that their relationship will carry on after an initial spell working together during the four - week grass court season			1
conditioning : @entity2 receives treatment from his physio @entity20 with @entity4 in background push : @entity2 works out in @entity8 as he looks to bounce back from his disappointing @entity6 defence heat : @entity2 trains on court without his shirt on in the warm temperatures in @entity8 as @entity28 first revealed , the plan was always for this to be a long - term deal with a trial period at first , rather than the other way round , and her presence in @entity35 appears to confirm the commitment on both sides			1
it was thought the biggest stumbling block might be a reluctance to travel on her part			0
but it seems she has cut short her summer holiday to be with him ahead of the @entity47 , his next tournament , which begins on august 4 in @entity49			2
@entity2 has said that at times he may be willing to do training blocks nearer to where it might be convenient for her , but with the punishing conditions for the next few tournaments he was adamant he wanted to head to south @entity35 at this time of year			1
also in @entity8 are assistant coach @entity56 and fitness trainer @entity57 , both of whom are known to have been unhappy at being kept out of the loop about his original plan to work with @entity4			2
their presence suggests that has been smoothed over , although there may be some small adjustments to the way his support staff operate in future , or its make - up , when the announcement is made			0
loss : @entity2 suffered a disappointing quarter - final defeat at the hands of @entity76 @entity77 : @entity76 beat @entity2 in straight sets on @entity79 to end the @entity81 's @entity6 defence @entity2 played beautifully at @entity6 until putting in a bafflingly poor performance in the quarter final , albeit against an inspired @entity76			1
combined with his unscheduled exit from the @entity86 at @entity87 it did not add up to a dream start with @entity4 , although he made clear from the outset that it would be too early to make an impact either way at @entity6			2
amid the fever of the fortnight there was much speculation about his reported cry in the quarter final referring to ‘ five minutes before the match ’ , although i understand that he actually said ’ 45 minutes ’ before the match , in reference to some technical instruction from his staff			2
either way it has not been of any long - term importance			0
before taking a brief break prior to resuming training @entity2 made it clear he had enjoyed working with the former sw19 women ’s champion , and now it seems he wants her to take him forward for a much longer period			1
in some ways this is a good place for them to start in earnest together , as he is freed from the pressure of being @entity6 champion , is over his back surgery , and has slipped back into the chasing pack with a world ranking of number ten			1
he probably has a window of four or five years to add to his @entity129 and @entity130 haul , with no sign of the competition easing			0
after losing at @entity133 suggested that he would be taking the forthcoming masters level tournaments in @entity136 and @entity137 more seriously than he has in the past , as arguably what hurt him most on the grass was his lack of big wins going into the tournament			0
' it ’s been a year since i won an event and the best way to prepare for majors is by winning a lot of matches and i have not done that , ' he said			0
' in @entity151 ( january ) i did n’t do that , i did n’t do that before the @entity154 , i did n’t win @entity86			0
' it has n’t stopped me playing from having good runs in the @entity157 but to have great ones it helps if you have a good build - up			0
' @entity161 trains with @entity4 for the first time - and it wo n't be the last			0
