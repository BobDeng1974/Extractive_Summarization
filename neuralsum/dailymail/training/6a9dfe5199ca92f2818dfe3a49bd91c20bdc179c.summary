growing up inside @entity2 cult , @entity0 was sexually abused , made to live in a compound and taught to fear the outside world			1
at the age of 18 she escaped and now , eleven years later , she feels strong enough to tell her story			1
' i was sexually abused from the age of four - on several occasions , ' the cult survivor revealed as she poured her heart out to @entity11 and @entity12 on @entity14 's @entity13			1
' it was a very sexualised environment			0
it started out innocently with the idea that anything done in love is ok , but it became more bizarre where husband and wives were expected to share their partners with others			0
' then it went one step further with flirty fishing - where women were told to use their bodies to win men ( converts ) to @entity32 , often in return for a donation			1
' i have very few happy childhood memories			0
the brief moments spent with my family , were few and far between , ' said @entity0 , who was forced to live in a compound with 150 other members in a variety of communes across @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
' i have 12 siblings but we certainly were n't at the beach every day - we were behind high walls in a compound , ' she recalled			0
to make money , the cult would send the children out to beg			2
' we 'd go out fundraising and do shows			0
but we were taught to fear outside world , ' said @entity0 , whose parents are @entity62 - born			1
' we were told there were two types of people - the nasty people were goats and nice people were sheep			2
' but they told us that the majority had turned away from @entity32 and that we were the army of the end time			1
' @entity0 was sexually abused from the age of four and made to witness sexual acts by other adults the cult 's leader , @entity75 , predicted that the world would come to an end at the end of the millennium , but died in 1994 before witnessing his prediction fail			1
' they trained us to be elite soldiers who would be fighting the anti-christ			0
they told us we 'd be blessed with lightning bolts from our eyes and have the ability to knock people dead with the touch of our hand			2
these were all the gifts we were meant to receive , ' she said			0
it 's been 11 years since @entity0 managed to escape from the cult and she 's now happily married and been living in the @entity96 for five years			1
' i 'm in contact with my parents and siblings , ' she said			0
' my parents left a couple of years ago			2
' how does she have a normal relationship with them , given so much of her suffering was due to their decisions , she was asked			0
' it 's difficult - i went through many years of bitterness and hatred , ' she admitted			1
' but it 's the understanding that they were victims in some sort of way too			2
' that does n't excuse everything but my main opinion now is that to hate and to be bitter would only make me unhappy and i 'm not going to let the cult do that to me anymore so at some point for your own sanity you have to let go			2
' the cult , which has now changed its name to @entity125 , has denied any allegations of institutionalised abuse			0
in her new book the cult survivor tells of her disturbing childhood and her escape in a statement , read by @entity13 's @entity11 , the cult said it had apolologised on a number of occasions to anyone who felt they were a victim of abuse			1
the statement also expressed a ' zero tolerance ' for abuse and said the cult permanently expelled any members who violated the policy			0
@entity0 did not comment , but responded to the statement with a wry smile			2
the cult survivor has now documented the full story of her childhood in a book ' born into the @entity125 : my life in a religious sex cult and my struggle for survival on the outside '			0
' it 's been amazing and cathartic , ' said @entity0			1
' it 's the final step in my healing process , to not feel i have to hide or feel shame about my past and trying to turn it into something good and encouraging for other people			0
