the sight of an aspiring model who had bleach thrown in her face was saved by a friend splashing her eyes with @entity6			1
@entity7 , 17 , was left with raw burns and hair loss when a school bully attacked her at a party shouting : ‘ here ’s your shot of bleach			1
’ yesterday a judge sentenced @entity17 , then also 17 , to 27 months behind bars for the assault , which he described as a ‘ spiteful and vengeful act ’			1
@entity23 , who modelled under the name @entity25 and at the time dyed her hair bright pink , had been bullied by @entity29 at the college where they were studying , the court heard			2
@entity7 , 17 , was left with raw burns and hair loss when a school bully attacked her at a party in @entity35 in august last year , while shouting : ‘ here ’s your shot of bleach ' @entity29 was suspended as a result and began threatening to attack her accuser with bleach			1
‘ she knew she was a model and it was designed to burn and disfigure , ’ said @entity41 , prosecuting			0
but her sight was saved when a quick - thinking friend carrying some @entity6 splashed it over her burning eyes			1
the assault came in a carefully - planned ambush in which @entity23 was lured to a house party in their home town of @entity35 last august			1
first aid manuals stress the vital importance of flushing out the eyes with lukewarm water if they come into contact with harmful chemicals			0
ideally the eyes will be bathed for at least 15 - 20 minutes to dilute the substance and remove as much of it as possible before it can cause damage			2
if water is n’t available , alternative liquids such as soft drinks can also be suitable – making the action of @entity23 ’s friend an admirable improvisation			2
however , once an acid or alkali enters the eye , there is usually no specific benefit in using the opposite to try to neutralise it			0
she was unaware that @entity29 was there but became suspicious that something was wrong and left			2
her tormentor then followed her down the street and flung the bleach in her face with the aim of ruining her looks			2
a previous hearing heard that @entity29 shouted : ‘ here ’s your shot of bleach instead of your shot of vodka			1
this is for getting me thrown out of college ’			0
she could have suffered permanent damage to her sight had it not been for ‘ a friend who irrigated her eyes with the soft drink she was carrying ’ , judge @entity93 told @entity100			1
‘ this was an assault which was unprovoked and premeditated			0
’ however , @entity23 needed treatment in hospital , continues to suffer chronic dryness in her eyes and had to wear a wig as a result of damage to her hair			1
she also suffered severe psychological harm – leaving her feeling unable to socialise with friends – and made a suicide attempt two months later			2
writing on @entity114 after the attack , @entity23 said : ‘ the outer layer of my eyes are permanently damaged and my hair has turned green from the bleach and has fallen out at the front			1
@entity23 ( pictured left and right arriving at court ) could have suffered permanent damage to her sight had it not been for ‘ a friend who irrigated her eyes with the soft drink she was carrying ’ , @entity100 told ‘ i have burns on my body from all the chemicals inside the bleach and i am in excruciating pain in my eyes			1
they are red raw , it went in my mouth , up my nose and i could n’t breathe			2
’ the judge added that @entity23 – who did not attend court – ‘ used to pride herself in her appearance and her hair ’ but now suffers ‘ flashbacks [ and ] panic attacks ’			0
@entity17 was sentenced to 27 months behind bars for the assault he told @entity29 : ‘ the emotional harm you have caused has been grave			1
since the offence her life has changed			0
she has lost confidence , she feels unable to go out and socialise ... indeed she feels barely able to go out socially at all			0
’ @entity29 was also handed a four - year restraining order against @entity23 after pleading guilty at a previous hearing to applying a corrosive fluid , with intent to burn , maim , disfigure or disable or to do some grievous bodily harm			1
she will serve her sentence at a young offenders ’ institution			0
afterwards detective sergeant @entity159 , of @entity160 , said @entity23 could have been seriously injured			0
‘ it followed a prolonged bullying campaign by @entity29 which caused her victim a great deal of distress , ’ he added			0
‘ i hope @entity29 ’s sentence serves as a warning to others			0
’ the attack comes amid mounting concern over a rise in the number of acid or bleach attacks			1
last year a newspaper investigation revealed there had been 21 court cases involving the throwing or sending of dangerous substances in 2013 – compared to just five the previous year			0
one of the most notorious cases came in 2008 when model @entity181 sustained horrendous injuries after an ex-boyfriend arranged for acid to be thrown in her face .			0

@entity7 , 17 , was left with raw burns and hair loss after attack in @entity35

she could have suffered permanent sight damage without friend **'s** actions
@entity17 , then 17 , *jailed* after pleading guilty to ' spiteful and vengeful act '
