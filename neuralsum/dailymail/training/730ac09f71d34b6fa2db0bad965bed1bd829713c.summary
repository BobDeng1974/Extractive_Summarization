the suspended ' dirty ' dentist at the centre of an infection - control investigation raked in more than £ 1,000 a day seeing huge numbers of patients to fund his lavish lifestyle			1
@entity7 's alleged flouting of @entity9 safety guidelines sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed as he treated up to 40 patients in one morning			1
@entity9 bosses have urged any former patients who were treated by the 60 - year - old at @entity15 to come forward for blood tests for @entity17 and hepatitis			1
a whistleblower claimed he re-used dirty equipment and failed to change his gloves between patients			1
and it emerged the latest @entity25 report by health inspectors who examined the surgery in july found medical equipment was stored in a staff toilet , posing ' a risk of these items coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated '			1
dentist @entity7 is at the centre of a major public health scare amid allegations he flouted infection - control measures at his @entity40 practice over a 32 - year period			1
so far more than 2,000 of his former patients have sought help and advice it has emerged mr @entity7 raked in around £ 1,000 a day treated a huge number of patients to fund his lavish lifestyle			1
he sold his @entity50 mansion on the outskirts of @entity52 for £ 1.5 million earlier this year and moved to a luxury @entity52 flat , pictured six months earlier inspectors had given mr @entity7 a clean bill of health			1
detectives are also investigating whether the death of 23 - year - old patient @entity59 is linked to dental treatments she received			2
more than 1,300 people have so far contacted a helpline set up to advise former patients , and another 600 have visited a dedicated clinic to seek blood tests			2
it comes as the true scale of mr @entity7 's vast income has emerged , fuelled by a huge turnaround of patients to fund an extravagant lifestyle			1
the 60 - year - old lived in a lavishly furnished @entity50 mansion and drove a range of sports cars , including a @entity76 , a @entity77 and a @entity78 , with personalised number plates			2
the impressive @entity50 mansion stands in seven - acres of grounds			2
it features seven bedrooms , three reception rooms and a study , garages for three cars , a tennis court , pond , wood , meadow and secret garden			0
it is built on land formerly owned by the @entity96 family , renowned landowners in @entity40			0
he sold the £ 1.5million grade two listed property , @entity101 , on the outskirts of @entity103 , @entity40 , earlier this year and moved to a luxury flat in an upmarket area of @entity52			1
dentists are paid per patient , earning a minimum of £ 18.50 for a basic check - up and polish on the @entity9			1
health bossees revealed mr @entity7 saw 166 patients in a three - day period when he was filmed by a whistleblower in june			1
at an average of 55 patients a day , mr @entity7 would have earned a minimum of £ 1,017 a day and around £ 3,071 if all patients were paying the minimum fee			1
if 55 patients a day was an average for mr @entity7 , it means the 60 - year - old would have earned in excess of £ 371,000 a year , before tax			1
it is not known how many of mr @entity7 's patients had their treatment fully funded by the @entity9			1
but it is unlikely that over the course of the three - day period in june mr @entity7 only treated those patients charged the minimum fee			1
dentists charge @entity9 patients according to three bands - a band two appointment costs £ 50.50 and a band three , for the most complex procedures including dentures and bridges , costs £ 219			1
it is therefore likely that mr @entity7 's earnings were in excess of £ , 3,071 across the three days , and £ 371,000 a year			1
@entity142 are making enquiries into the death of @entity59 , 23 , a patient of mr @entity7 who died unexpectedly last year dr @entity145 , a medical director for @entity146 in @entity40 , said : ' he saw 166 patients in a three - day period			1
' that is a lot of patients			2
the footage showed us there were serious lapses			0
' mr @entity7 , who studied at the @entity154 and qualified in 1977 , was suspended for just 18 months in august by the @entity155 , pending the start of the investigation			1
@entity9 dentists are paid according to three bands			2
band 1 : £ 18.50 covers an examination , diagnosis and advice			2
if necessary it will also cover x-rays , a scale and polish and planning for further treatment band 2 : £ 50.50 covers all treatment covered by band one , plus additional treatment including fillings , root canal and removing teeth			2
@entity176 : £ 219 covers all treatments covered in bands one and two , plus complex procedures including crowns , dentures and bridges miss @entity59 , 23 , visited her gp on august 18 , 2013 , suffering from palpitations , and was taken to @entity186 before being transferred to @entity187 , where she died on august 22 of viral acute myocarditis			2
now @entity40 coroner @entity189 , who was not made aware that she had visited mr @entity7 's surgery prior to her death , has asked police to investigate			1
miss @entity59 's death was attributed to natural causes and because she died in hospital no inquest was held			2
the coroner has to power to order an inquest if she feels there are any questions over her death			0
@entity146 has set aside £ 500,000 for a massive operation to recall the 22,000 patients he treated in a career spanning three decades			1
patients say their dentist 's fall from grace has sent shockwaves through their community			2
he was as a well - liked and popular man before he left his role at the surgery earlier this year			0
one former patient of mr @entity7 , @entity214 , told @entity215 he had only ever been impressed by his dentist of more than 20 years			1
mr @entity7 worked for 32 years at the @entity217 , pictured , in @entity218 , @entity52			1
@entity9 bosses stressed the practice is under new ownership he said : ' he is a brilliant dentist			2
professional , courteous and the same goes for the staff			0
' a very popular dentist as the large numbers involved prove			0
' the whole thing stinks			0
i hate to think what mr @entity7 is going through			1
' rumours of his suspension had spread through the community before this week 's report was released by the @entity155 , criticising his hygiene practices			0
inspectors from the @entity235 visited @entity15 on july 17			2
their inspection came a month after a whistleblower raised concerns with health bosses over alleged infection - control breaches			1
in august , a report into their findings , found the practice failing in three of the five areas assessed - cleanliness and infection control , safety , availability and suitability of equipment and assessing and monitoring the quality of service provision			1
the report highlighted a range of hygiene concerns			0
inspectors noted : ' we observed the staff toilet and the room next to the toilet were being used as store rooms for equipment			0
' this posed a risk of these items coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated			0
' this risk had not been identified by staff at the dental surgery and no action had been taken to minimise it			0
' we saw that mops and buckets for cleaning the practice were stored directly next to the staff toilet , in the same room , which again posed a risk of this cleaning equipment coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated			0
' the report noted the practice had an infection - control programme in place , and that it had been reviewed in february 2013			1
inspectors had visited the clinic just six months before , in november last year , and gave it a clean bill of health			0
@entity289 , 24 , a construction worker from @entity290 said : ' when my partner told me about it , i was speechless			0
i came straight down to the centre and registered to be tested			0
' i had three teeth out earlier this year and there were no problems but it makes you think			0
' it all makes me feel uneasy , worried and a little bit scared			0
i 've been going there all my life and if i 've got something in my blood and passed it on to my partner , she could have given it to my son when she was pregnant			0
' @entity307 , 27 , from @entity103 , said she was worried about the situation because she is eight months pregnant			0
she said : ' i 'm having to get my children to go and have blood tests because of this , and i 'm pregnant i should n't be having to worry about it			0
' i think it 's disgusting			0
it 's a small dentist so i know they kept files in the toilets , so it would n't surprise me if he kept equipment in there as well			0
' she said they had been given packs with advice in and now had to wait 14 days until they find out the results			0
her mother , @entity328 , 54 , also of @entity103 , said : ' it 's absolutely disgusting			0
to think that our whole family has been going to see him for so long and now we 're all having to get tested over this			0
' @entity146 said 1,333 patients had so far called the helpline , and more than 600 people had gone to a clinic set up to deal with queries and perform precautionary blood tests			2
a spokeswoman said 452 patients had so far been tested at the clinic in @entity103 , @entity52			1
a dedicated advice line has been set up offering guidance on how to access additional support			0
