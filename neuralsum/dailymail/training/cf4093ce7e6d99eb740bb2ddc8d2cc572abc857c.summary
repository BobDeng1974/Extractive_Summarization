a former high - ranking @entity1 administration official writes in his forthcoming memoir that the @entity3 was ' so eager to rid itself of @entity5 ' that advisers steered the president toward withdrawing all @entity9 troops instead of trying to ink an agreement to let them legally stay past 2011			1
@entity11 , @entity1 's first @entity12 director and his second defense secretary , writes in the book ' @entity15 : a memoir of leadership in @entity17 ' that @entity1 's inner circle lacked a sense of urgency about finalizing a deal with @entity5 's then - prime minister @entity22			1
' to my frustration , ' @entity11 writes , ' the @entity3 coordinated the negotiations but never really led them , ' leaving the @entity26 to proceed ' without the president ’s active advocacy			1
@entity22 , according to @entity11 , insisted that his nation 's divided and fiercely sectarian @entity47 needed to debate and approve any such agreement			1
that , he writes in ' @entity50 , ' put the deal in limbo and left the @entity3 wringing its hands even though the leaders of all @entity5 's skirmishing factions wanted the @entity9 to stay , in some form , as a backstop against opportunistic jihadis			1
fighting words : @entity11 's book goes on sale oct. 7 ' to this day , ' @entity11 insists , ' i believe that a small @entity9 troop presence in @entity5 could have effectively advised the @entity5 military on how to deal with @entity66 ’s resurgence and the sectarian violence that has engulfed the country			1
' @entity69 published a short excerpt from the book on wednesday evening			0
@entity73 spokeswoman @entity72 told reporters on thursday during her regular daily briefing that the @entity9 ' did n’t have the requirements needed to leave our troops there ' at the time			0
' the administration , she said , ' was certainly committed to doing everything we could to secure the requirements needed to have forces there			0
obviously , we were unable to do that			0
' @entity11 disagrees , writing that the administration ignored ' leverage ' the @entity9 had over @entity22 in the form of reconstruction aid dollars			2
' my fear , as i voiced to the president and others , ' he writes , ' was that if the country split apart or slid back into the violence that we ’d seen in the years immediately following the @entity9 invasion , it could become a new haven for terrorists to plot attacks against the @entity9 ' ' i privately and publicly advocated for a residual force that could provide training and security for @entity5 ’s military			1
' but although the @entity110 and military commanders on the ground in @entity5 agreed , ' the president ’s team at the @entity3 pushed back , and the differences occasionally became heated			2
' ' those on our side , ' @entity11 says , ' viewed the @entity3 as so eager to rid itself of @entity5 that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests			2
' the self - styled @entity34 ( @entity34 ) has murdered tens of thousands and turned millions more into refugees as it plows through @entity5 and @entity123 @entity11 writes in his book that he and joint chiefs chairman gen. @entity125 urged the president to arm @entity123 's moderate rebels in 2012 but @entity1 demurred – only to do it in 2014 after the civil war there intensified @entity11 's book ruffled its first feathers two weeks ago when ' @entity133 ' reported that he and the rest of @entity1 's national security team had urged the president in 2012 to arm moderate @entity123 rebel groups hostile to dictator @entity137			1
@entity1 , @entity11 wrote , overruled them all			0
more recently , with two additional years of civil war in the rear - view mirror , @entity1 has secured $ 500 million from @entity141 to ' train and equip ' the rebels			0
' i think that would 've helped ' in 2012 , @entity11 told 60 minutes ' during a sept. 21 broadcast			0
' and i think , in part , we pay the price for not doing that in what we see happening with @entity34			0
' he also hinted at his belief that a less - complete troop pullout at the end of 2011 ' would 've given us greater leverage over @entity5 's government .			2

@entity11 , who ran the @entity12 and the @entity158 for @entity1 , argued for a ' residual force ' to stay behind in @entity5 to *stabilize* the country
the @entity3 , he writes in a new book , fell down on the job and did n't negotiate a security agreement with the @entity22 government in @entity166
@entity1 has said it was @entity5 , not the @entity9 , that *scuttled* any chance for @entity9 troops to stay past 2011
the power vacuum left when @entity1 ordered servicemen and women home has been filled by @entity34 and other @entity66 *offshoots*
@entity11 said two weeks ago that @entity1 ignored his advice to arm @entity123 's moderate rebel groups in 2012 – a move that the president now *embraces*
