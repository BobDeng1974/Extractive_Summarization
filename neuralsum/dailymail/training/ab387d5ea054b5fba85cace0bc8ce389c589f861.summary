from @entity1 to @entity2 passing through @entity3 on the way to pig , @entity0 is full of funny and downright silly town names			1
and behind every one of those strange names is the obscure story of how that place came to be known and in some cases celebrated by its residents			2
take the tiny hamlet of @entity12 for starters			1
very tight lender : the town of @entity12 , @entity16 , famous for @entity17 with a population of 64 , the small town southeast of @entity19 was named after the postmaster was cheated in a watermelon deal at the local store in the early 1990 's			1
simply out of spite , he took advantage of his privilege as town postmaster and renamed the town @entity12			1
retaining that moniker to this day , the major attraction in the town is the humorously named @entity17 , which is federally insured and ironically classified as ' well capitalised '			1
no name nowhere : stuck between @entity36 and @entity37 the residents of no name are proud of their town 's history however , if parsimonious town names do n't do it for you then why not take a stroll through @entity44 , @entity45 , if you can find it			1
sandwiched conveniently between @entity36 and @entity46 , the town with no name began after the major @entity49 was built			2
an official with the @entity51 noticed that the area did not carry a sobriquet on the map and wrote ' @entity44 ' for @entity55			0
inspiring the local community with its absurdity the name stuck and when later the residents were offered the opportunity to change to a more traditional designation the community chose to remain nameless			0
elephant @entity63 : one of @entity65 's top tourist destinations is at the other end of the highway from @entity68 the plight of a nameless town in @entity45 is brought into perspective when one is faced with a fork in the road that offers @entity68 as one destination and @entity63 as the other			1
seemingly caught between a double dare or a herd of escaped circus performers you would be forgiven for scratching your head			0
in fact the name @entity63 refers to a volcanic cone that slightly resembles the animal 's silhouette in the middle of a reservoir that is a favourite vacation spot in the state of @entity65			2
@entity92 town : unable to spell the name of the local grouse that lives in the area the locals settled on chicken insteadd if calling a town after a local landmark that slightly resembles an animal is one way of doing it then spare a thought for the @entity105 outpost of @entity97			2
populated by large numbers of the ptarmigan , which is a type of grouse , the gold - prospectors in the area wanted to name their new town after the bird			2
however , because no one could agree on the correct spelling and to avoid ridicule the locals named their township @entity97 instead			0
one of the few remaining gold - rush towns in @entity105 , @entity97 has no phone service , no electricity and its population fluctuates between 17 and 37			0
@entity122 diet : named following a flood in the 1800 's the rabbit hash was all you could eat in the town for years from too many birds to too many bunnies in the town of @entity130 , @entity131			1
named following an 1847 flood that washed everything in the town bar the prolific rabbit population away , the rebuilding residents had to dine on the floppy eared survivors for years afterwards			0
so much so that they named their town after what had become their staple meal			0
@entity141 : the town 's sign is bolted down to stop the repeated theft that kept on occuring however , for sheer silliness the town of @entity147 , @entity145 has it covered			1
named after a mighty biblical hunter , the town welcomes thousands of tourists each year looking to have their picture taken under the welcome sign			0
after many attempts to steal it @entity154 have now taken to having their sign bolted down			0
the longest and silliest of them all : all 58 letters of @entity160 undoubtedly though , the king of stupid town names is @entity160 in @entity163			1
with 58 letters the name translates to @entity166 in the @entity167 near to the @entity168 of @entity169 of the @entity170			0
although not authentic @entity172 , the name was an 1860 's publicity stunt created by the railway station so that it would have the longest name in @entity177 .			0
