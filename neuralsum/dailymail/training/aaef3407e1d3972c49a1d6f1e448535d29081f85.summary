by @entity1 reporter federal police blocked access friday to a central @entity5 hospital where six people were reported to have been admitted with radiation exposure			1
an official familiar with the case confirmed @entity5 media reports that the six have been admitted to the general hospital in the city of @entity14 and may have been exposed to a stolen source of @entity16			1
the official , who spoke friday on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to the media , said only one person was dizzy and vomiting , which are symptoms of radiation poisoning			2
it was recovered the next day , but opened which means that whoever opened is probably suffering from radiation poisoning packed : the above photo shows the box containing the teletherapy equipment the atomic energy agency said the cobalt has an activity of 3,000 curries , or category 1 , meaning ' it would probably be fatal to be close to this amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period in the range of a few minutes to an hour			1
' the missing shipment of radioactive @entity16 was found wednesday about 40 kilometers ( 24 miles ) from where it had been stolen early monday			1
it 's not clear if those hospitalized are responsible for the theft			1
the cargo truck hauling the cobalt - 60 was taken from a gas station in the central state of @entity64 , where @entity14 is located			1
the material had been removed from obsolete radiation therapy equipment at a hospital in the northern city of @entity69 and was being transported to nuclear waste facility in the state of @entity5 , which borders @entity72			1
the highly radioactive material was found in an empty parking lot about a kilometer from @entity75 , a small farming town of about 4,000 people - close to where it was originally stolen			1
officials say the radioactive source had been removed from its container but say whoever had opened could die ' because the source 's intensity is very high '			2
' they will eventually have to go to a hospital , and we 'll be waiting for them , ' @entity86 official @entity85 said			2
dangerous situation : representatives of the @entity92 and the @entity93 stand guard near the radiation container in a field near the village of @entity75 cleaning up : the stolen container was found in a field in a rural town in central @entity5			1
authorities are now working at containing the radioactive material cordoned off : authorities are restricting access to the area surrounding the container so no one is accidentally exposed to the radioactive material according to @entity108 , director general of the @entity109 , the shipment of @entity16 was category 1 meaning ' it would probably be fatal to be close to this amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period in the range of a few minutes to an hour			1
' authorities are now in the process of containing the material in order to transport it to a waste site , which they estimate will take about two days			2
' it 's a very delicate operation			2
what 's important is that the material has been located and the place is being watched to guarantee no one gets close , ' @entity108 , director of the @entity109 , told the @entity127			0
the container was discovered by a family , who were promptly put under medical observation , but according to @entity75 's mayor , @entity132 , they suffered no harm			0
the truck marked ' @entity135 ' left @entity69 on november 28 and was on its way to a nuclear waste facility when the driver stopped to rest at a gas station in @entity140 , in @entity64 north of @entity72			1
the driver , @entity141 , told authorities he was sleeping in the truck when two men with a gun approached about 1:30am tuesday			0
they made him get out , tied his hands and feet and left him in a vacant lot nearby			0
safe : the family who discovered the stolen container were taken to a hospital for medical observation , but were not harmed			1
above , a picture of other residents looking at the container from a distance watching : @entity158 patrol atop a vehicle as residents look on near the perimeter where dangerous radioactive medical material was found when he was able to free himself , he ran back to the gas station to get help			0
police and military quickly joined the hunt to find the missing cobalt - 60 because it could be used by terrorists to create a ' dirty bomb '			1
but authorities do n't believe that the thieves who stole the truck did it to intentionally steal the @entity16			1
@entity108 said that the thieves were mostly likely after the white 2007 @entity176 cargo vehicle			2
on average , a half dozen thefts of radioactive materials are reported in @entity5 each year and none have proven to be aimed at the cargo , @entity108 said			0
he said that in all the cases the thieves were after shipping containers or the vehicles			0
unintentional thefts of radioactive materials are not uncommon , said an official familiar with cases reported by @entity190 member states , who was not authorized to comment on the case			0
in some cases , radioactive sources have ended up being sold as scrap , causing serious harm to people who unknowingly come into contact with it			0
exposure : none of the locals were harmed when the container was opened			0
above , residents talk with each other as they wait for news on the radioactive material in a @entity5 case in the 1970s , one thief died and the other was injured when they opened a container holding radioactive material , he said			0
the container was junked and sold to a foundry , where it contaminated some steel reinforcement bars made there			0
@entity108 said all foundries in @entity5 now have equipment to detect radioactive material			0
on the lookout : @entity5 authorities scrambled wednesday to find a truck containing ' extremely dangerous ' radioactive material used in medical treatment			2
the truck and its contents have now been found seperately			0

police have blocked access to a hospital in @entity14 after six were admitted for radiation exposure
a truck containing a shipment of cobalt - 60 was stolen monday
the cobalt - 60 was recovered wednesday , but grave fears were held for the thieves
exposure to @entity16 can kill those exposed ' almost immediately '
the cobalt had been used for cancer treatments in @entity69
*experts* say cobalt - 60 can also be used to make a dirty bomb
the truck was headed to a waste facility
thieves probably *wanted* truck and were *unaware* of nuclear cargo
it 's not clear if the six hospitalized are the thieves
