by @entity0 published : 19:18 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 04:08 est , 15 may 2013 obsessed : the @entity1 heard how @entity2 used his mobile phone to trawl the web for child porn before he killed 12 - year - old @entity2 @entity7 is under pressure to act over the ease with which @entity2 was able to use the internet to fuel his child - sex fantasies			1
@entity13 was obsessed by paedophile websites and used his mobile phone to trawl the web for child porn before he killed 12 - year - old @entity2			1
police found searches including the terms ‘ naked little girlies ’ , ‘ illegal under - age incest pics ’ and ‘ schoolgirl abuse ’ in his @entity7 browser			1
there were also @entity7 searches for ‘ violent forced rape ’ , ‘ little girls in glasses ’ , ‘ daddy daughter pictures ’ and ‘ under - age incest galleries ’ , and he visited a child abuse website on august 6 last year – as @entity34 ’s body lay hidden in the loft of the home he shared with her grandmother			1
experts believe @entity13 ’s habitual use of violent and paedophile pornography on the internet saw him progress from petty criminal to child killer			1
last night child safety charities , including the @entity47 , demanded @entity7 introduce immediate controls to stop monsters such as @entity13 from getting access to child pornography			1
@entity53 , of the @entity52 on internet safety , said : ‘ if these images were not available on the internet then men like @entity2 might not go on to kill			1
‘ we can not blame the internet for the likes of @entity2 but it has opened pathways that lead them on to violent pornography and paedophile material			1
he also wants @entity7 to make their ‘ safe search ’ facility the default on their web browser			1
he added : ‘ that is something @entity7 could do overnight			2
’ @entity77 , of the @entity47 , said : ‘ @entity7 need to do more in terms of blocking searches for child abuse imagery but they also need to be alerting the authorities if someone is blatantly doing these searches			1
’ @entity84 , the former head of the @entity85 , said the internet could create a ‘ spiral of abuse ’ where offenders awakened their sexual interest in children and met like - minded people who normalised their behaviour			2
he added : ‘ ultimately what they find online is not enough to satisfy them and they can move to attacking a real child in the real world			2
’ @entity13 had some 30 previous convictions dating back to the early 1990s for offences ranging from dishonesty , drug dealing and violence to a conviction for possessing a machete			0
he had no history of sex offences and there was no suggestion he was a threat to children			0
however the @entity1 heard how he had become obsessed by pornography and had downloaded ‘ extensive ’ illegal images onto memory cards he had hidden at his home			2
critics believe stopping monsters like @entity13 accessing child porn could save victims like @entity2 in the future he kept photographs and video clips showing @entity34 sleeping - and on one occasion filmed her as she rubbed cream on her legs in her underwear			1
police also discovered a grotesque image of a girl believed to be @entity34 which is thought to have been taken after she died			0
the highly disturbing ‘ keepsake ’ image showed a naked girl , whose face can not be seen , posed on all fours on a bloodied bed			0
mr @entity77 added : ‘ the use of imagery in sex offending is not new			0
@entity144 @entity143 and @entity145 photographed and filmed their victims			0
‘ but the internet means this kind of behaviour has taken on a new dimension			2
there are clearly some violent and particularly psychopathic who use the internet			2
‘ we are very concerned that the ease with which they can get child abuse images to fuel their fantasies			0
’ police found @entity13 had used @entity7 on his mobile phone to access websites that glorified incest and child abuse			1
but his behaviour had escalated from accessing images of abuse online to actively seeking to spy on , photograph and film @entity34			0
he is believed to have removed the bathroom door at @entity34 ’s grandmother ’s home so he could spy on the schoolgirl			0
and @entity13 is also thought to have modified the light socket in her room to create a spyhole			0
@entity34 's mother @entity178 hugs a loved one after @entity2 was jailed for 38 years for her murder a report by the @entity85 and @entity181 ( @entity85 ) @entity182 has identified a link between viewing child porn online and ‘ contact ’ sexual offences against children			1
@entity84 , the former head of @entity85 , said the internet could create a ‘ spiral of abuse ’ where offenders awakened their sexual interest in children and met like - minded people who normalised their behaviour			0
he added : ‘ ultimately what they find online is not enough to satisfy them and they can move to attacking a real child in the real world			0
’ @entity13 ’s escalation in offending is similar to @entity206 who murdered @entity206 in @entity208 in 2010 after becoming fixated with extreme pornography sites showing women being strangled			0
@entity211 from the @entity213 campaign which is calling for a family friendly internet believes @entity7 should do more to block illegal images			1
she added : ‘ the ease of access provided by the @entity218 means more people than ever before are going down that route			0
’ a @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ we take this issue extremely seriously			2
when we discover child abuse imagery or are made aware of it , we respond quickly to remove and report it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities			0

@entity2 was obsessed by paedophile websites
@entity230 searched @entity7 for child porn before he killed @entity2
campaigners say internet gian must ' do more ' to block access
