in the dark : @entity2 secretary @entity1 has admitted @entity3 did not know about the considerable problems with the new health insurance website until after its launch president @entity3 was in the dark about the considerable problems with the @entity11 's website until after the launch of the troubled service , the @entity13 health chief has revealed			1
insurance companies have been complaining about issues using the site , which crashed during a test run before the launch , but the president was apparently unaware of the technical problems			1
speaking to @entity23 , @entity1 , the country 's @entity24 , said mr @entity3 first learned of them ' the first couple of days after ' the site went live on october 1			1
when asked if he knew of any of the website 's problems before that , she replied : ' no , sir			1
' @entity3 â€™s healthcare website has come under severe scrutiny since its launch and its programmers have said they expressed concerns beforehand but were ignored by their seniors			1
insider interviews and a review of technical specifications found a mind - numbingly complex system put together by harried programmers who pushed out a final product that congressional investigators said was tested by the government and not private developers with more expertise			1
@entity1 said a team of experts has now been drafted in from @entity51 to solve the issues with the site			1
they are being led by @entity55 , a former ceo and acting director of the @entity57			0
@entity1 admitted the government had hoped the @entity60 website had the ' a-team ' working on it from the start , when asked why the experts were not brought in before its launch			1
' we want new eyes and ears			0
we want to make sure that we get all the questions on the table , that we get all the answers and accelerator the fix as quickly as possible			0
' part of the problem is attributed to ' extremely high ' volume , @entity1 told @entity23 , with close to 20 million people using the new website in the first three weeks			1
ultimately , @entity1 said the president and his team were not satisfied with the workings of the website , which they planned to be easy to use allowing consumers to compare healthcare policy plans			1
to date , 500,000 accounts had been created on the site , but not all of them have enrolled in healthcare plans			2
the president has pulled in @entity55 , left , acting director of @entity57 , to manage a team of experts drafted in to resolve the website 's problems defending himself : president @entity3 spoke about the technical problems with the healthcare website on monday after facing two weeks of backlash over the roll out of the @entity11 project developers who spoke to the @entity102 on condition of anonymity - because they feared they would otherwise be fired - said they raised doubts among themselves whether the website could be ready in time			1
they were crammed into conference rooms with pizza for dinner , some programmers working past 10pm with energy drinks in hand			2
others rewrote computer code over and over to meet what they considered last - minute requests for changes from the government or other contractors			0
they complained openly to each other about what they considered tight and unrealistic deadlines			0
one was nearly brought to tears over the stress of finishing on time , one developer said			0
website builders saw red flags for months			2
a review of internal architectural diagrams obtained by the @entity102 revealed the system 's complexity			0
problems : secretary @entity1 is the one tasked with the roll out and she has come under scrutiny insurance applicants have a host of personal information verified , including income and immigration status			1
the system connects to other federal computer networks , including ones at the @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and the @entity150			0
president @entity3 on monday acknowledged technical problems that he described as ' kinks in the system ' in a ' website that 's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance '			1
he also promised a ' tech surge ' by leading technology talent to repair the painfully slow and often unresponsive website to make ti work the ' way it should for everybody '			2
adding more options : following the slow responses on the website , the programers added ' apply by phone ' options ' there 's no sugarcoating it			2
the website has been too slow			2
people have been getting stuck during the application process			0
and i think it 's fair to say that nobody is more frustrated by that than i am , ' he said			0
the online system was envisioned as a simple way for people without health insurance to comparison - shop among competing plans offered in their state , pick their preferred level of coverage and cost and sign up			1
for many , it 's not worked out that way so far			0
pushing through : the president said that a ' tech surge ' is under way , but new reports reveal that programers had concerns before the website launched unresolved problems led to visitors experiencing cryptic error messages or enduring long waits trying to sign up			1
congressional investigators have concluded that the government 's @entity204 , not private software developers , tested the exchange 's computer systems during the final weeks			0
that task , known as integration testing , is usually handled by software companies because it ferrets out problems before the public sees the final product			2
the government spent at least $ 394million in contracts to build the federal health care exchange and the data hub			0
those contracts included major awards to @entity222 - based @entity221 , @entity224 - based @entity223 and @entity225 @entity221 said in a statement monday it was working with the government and other contractors ' around the clock ' to improve the system , which it called ' complex , ambitious and unprecedented			0
' the flood of computer problems since the website went online has been deeply embarrassing for the @entity236			1
the snags have called into question whether the administration is capable of implementing the complex policy and why senior administration officials - including the president - appear to have been unaware of the scope of the problems when the exchange sites opened			0
senator @entity246 , the leading @entity247 in the @entity248 , described the launch as a ' failure ' on sunday , adding he does n't believe the government can ' get the job done correctly '			0
the administration acknowledged on monday that a planned upgrade to the website had been postponed indefinitely and that online @entity257 - language signups would remain unavailable , despite a promise to @entity260 groups that the capability would start this week			0
the government has now tweaked the website 's home page so visitors can view phone numbers to apply the old - fashioned way or window - shop for insurance rates without registering first .			2

@entity1 said @entity3 found out a couple of days after launch
programmers *previously* *claimed* they raised alert prior to site going live
website supposed to be easy for users to compare , choose health insurance
but since going live on oct 1 it has been *plagued* with problems
