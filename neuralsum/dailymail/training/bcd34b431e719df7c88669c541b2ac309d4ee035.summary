all eyes were on @entity1 , and here is his heat map it was only 65 minutes in , but it had seemed an age			1
free - kicks flew wastefully into orbit ; darting runs were extinguished almost at inception ; passes were snuffled up by the blue meanies of @entity13			2
the @entity15 stadium , an @entity17 enclave in @entity18 for the night , yearned for their little master to assume his rightful place as the true star of this @entity23 , but it was not his night			1
@entity1 had only scored one @entity23 goal in his career , the same as @entity27 , and that was eight years ago			1
in match time , 623 minutes had expired since he last struck for @entity30 on this stage			2

@entity13 : ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity77 6 ; @entity78 6 ( @entity79 70 , 5 ) , @entity80 6 , @entity81 6.5 , @entity75 6 ; @entity82 7 , @entity83 6 ( @entity84 72 , 5 ) ; @entity85 7 , @entity86 6 ( @entity87 74 , 5 ) , @entity88 6 ; @entity89 6			1

ratings by @entity105 in the @entity15 and then it happened			0
oh , it was lovely			0
not just the move but the possibilities offered for this tournament			0
@entity1 with a monkey on his back is no @entity1 at all			1
@entity1 , liberated from pressure by a goal in his opening game , may now elevate this @entity23 to a higher plane			1
it was a beautiful passing advance , triangles working their way through the deep @entity13 midfield , before the ball found @entity1 , as it so often does for that is his genius , and he played an neat one - two with substitute @entity58			1
receiving the ball once more he ran from right to left with such nimble feet that two @entity13 guards , @entity80 and @entity82 , collided in his wake			2
now with clear sight of goal , he checked the position of goalkeeper @entity77 and finished perfectly , the ball coming off the inside of a post , so exceptionally was it judged			0
and that is what the greats do			0
until then , it was n’t his game			0
and then he made it so			0
until then , @entity13 looked more than capable of earning a point – an 85th minute goal by @entity79 confirmed the threat – and then it was out of their reach			1
@entity1 had made it his night after all			2
from here , the tournament begins – particularly if @entity148 decides to match him for @entity149 on monday , as he so often does when similarly challenged in @entity150			0
@entity1 was announced as man of the match at the end , a @entity155 award he will recognise as nonsense			2
if anything , the best players were the half - time substitutes @entity53 and @entity58 , whose introduction changed @entity30 ’s formation and the course of the game			1
until then , the team considered by many to be the finest at the tournament had laboured with three at the back			2
despite going a goal behind after three minutes , @entity13 were having the best of the game			1
perfect 10 : @entity1 points to the sky in trademark celebration after his fine strike that 's more like it : @entity1 's shot goes towards the post before hitting it and going into the net @entity1 scored his first goal of this @entity23 and a fine one it was , too - click here for more from our @entity183 history boy : @entity79 scores @entity13 's first ever goal at a major tournament horrendous start : @entity13 defender @entity189 ( no 5 ) is rooted to the spot after scoring an own goal @entity192 in his own box ! @entity30 defender @entity61 elaborately clears the ball under pressure @entity196 , @entity30 ’s manager , confessed his mistake by removing the anonymous @entity57 and a defender , @entity52 at half - time and switching to a back four			1
@entity53 , an impressive midfielder with @entity200 and one of the few members of this squad to have played outside @entity204 , freed up @entity1 and @entity205 and @entity30 thrived			1
what has been all too clear so far is that commercial profiles place the biggest players under almost intolerable pressure at modern @entity210			0
it was the humble @entity53 ’s involvement that helped @entity1 rise above this			2
we should all be very grateful			0
if there was a fault in @entity1 ’s game early on – and this is not a sentiment that will be aired regularly – it was that he almost tried to play the occasion rather than the match			2
this was @entity1 in the @entity15 – the world ’s most famous footballer in the world ’s most famous football stadium			2
it was an event that demanded brilliance , splendour , excitement to bursting point , and that was what @entity1 attempted desperately to deliver			2
unfortunately , it is not just well - meaning amateurs and @entity234 that can lose their way by trying too hard , and @entity1 fell victim to a very human flaw			0
he wanted it too much – the stage , the moment , the roar that would greet one of those scuttling , scintillating runs , when the ball appears to be tied to his foot by a strand of elastic and defenders circle like so many crazed ants whose nest has been disturbed by the sole of a sandal			0
hacked down : @entity89 ( centre ) is fouled from behind by @entity253 flying out : @entity30 goalkeeper @entity51 punches the ball away from @entity83 @entity1 reached for fabulousness time and again , but without luck or joy			1
@entity13 have been well drilled by coach @entity258 and whenever @entity1 got possession he was immediately detailed by two , sometimes three , blue shirts , obstructing his path , snapping at his heels , as eager to destroy as he was to create			1
not that @entity13 played a negative game , far from it			0
they were just not so daft that @entity1 was allowed to dominate the way his sponsors would have wished – the way his life is portrayed in commercial breaks when impossible is nothing and wizardry is real			0
what was real in the @entity15 was an opposition that had not fought its way to @entity275 to be anybody ’s support act on their debut			0
@entity13 are the fifth of the former @entity282 states to make it to a @entity23 – if one includes @entity285 as part of @entity287 in 1998 and 2006 – and the pride of the team and its fans was obvious			1
they suffered the most horrid start , but recovered , and those who feared they might be embarrassed here were quickly dissuaded of such negativity			0
a lesser team could have gone under after the bad luck that befell them three minutes in , but they regrouped and came at @entity30 with impressive ambition			0
doubling up : @entity1 tries to escape the attentions of @entity88 ( right ) and @entity75 trebling up ! @entity1 ( second left ) has @entity82 ( left ) , @entity81 ( centre ) and @entity75 for company pushing him out : @entity1 takes the ball as @entity75 tries to get close to him blocked off : @entity1 ( centre ) is stopped by the intervention of @entity88 ( right ) first the bad news			1
@entity30 won a free - kick 40 yards out to the left of goal , which @entity1 whipped in dangerously			1
giant full back @entity61 rose and headed it on , striking @entity75 on the boot for an unknowing diversion past goalkeeper @entity77			1
it could easily have been a prelude to a humbling @entity23 debut , but @entity13 are made of stronger stuff			1
from there , @entity51 in @entity30 ’s goal , received a thorough workout			1
@entity85 of @entity321 was pulling the strings in the centre of midfield and it was his ball in the 14th minute that showed @entity13 were in no mood to accept defeat			2
it dropped over @entity30 ’s high line defence and was gobbled up by midfielder @entity83			0
fortunately for @entity30 , @entity51 was alive to the threat and he dashed from his line to save			0
human shield : @entity89 keeps the ball from @entity30 defender @entity52 stretching a point : @entity13 midfielder @entity83 attempts to control the ball getting stuck in : @entity57 ( left ) thunders into a challenge with @entity13 's @entity82 @entity85 ’s set - pieces were proving as dangerous as his passes , and four minutes before half - time he picked out @entity88 with a fine inswinging corner , the resulting header forcing another excellent save from @entity51			1
@entity79 ’s late goal was no more than they deserved , even though @entity51 was weak for it			2
perhaps it was for the best			0
@entity13 can build from here , and look potential qualifiers , @entity1 is free to take his sun - blessed talents deeper into the tournament			1
he may return here on july 13			0
who knows what marvels we might have witnessed by then ? net gains : the @entity30 players celebrate after the early own goal by @entity75 ( second left ) full of cheer : @entity30 fans get into the spirit before kick - off at the @entity15 pleased to be here : @entity13 fans pose for the camera before the match against @entity30			1

@entity17 got off to the perfect start through @entity75 's own goal in the third minute
@entity30 laboured for the rest of the first half and into the second
@entity1 scored with a *precise* finish from the edge of the area
@entity79 pulled one back , @entity13 's first @entity23 goal
