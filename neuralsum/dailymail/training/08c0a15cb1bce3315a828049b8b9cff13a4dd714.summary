by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 06:20 est , 30 november 2012 it is a headache familiar to many parents - the foul smelling lotions , the painstaking grooming of figdety heads , while fending off little hands desperate for a scratch			1
but head lice do n't just affect children , as 36 - year - old @entity11 found out			1
the mother - of - two caught the itchy critters from her young son @entity14			0
she spent hundreds of pounds on treatments , potions and even new bed sheets and towels as she tried to get rid of the infestation , but to no avail			1
after six months of having a headful of nits ms @entity11 , of @entity21 was so desperate to get rid of them she even considered pouring bleach on to her head			1
ms @entity11 of @entity21 even considered pouring bleach on to her head to remove the lice ms @entity11 's ordeal began when five - year - old @entity14 started school last year			1
head lice are tiny wingless insects that live in human hair			1
they are common , particularly in children			0
they are grey - brown in colour , the size of a pinhead when hatched and of a sesame seed when fully grown			0
they can not fly , jump or swim and are spread by head - to - head contact , climbing from the hair of an infected person to the hair of someone else			1
a head lice infestation is not the result of dirty hair or poor hygiene			2
head lice can affect all types of hair irrespective of its condition and length			2
head lice only affect humans and can not be passed on to animals or be caught from them			0
she said : ' he was really excited when we enrolled him in september			0
' but the following january , we noticed @entity14 had brought home a few of his less welcome friends , head lice			0
' by the time i ’d found a few on his head , it was too late			0
they ’d managed to spread from @entity14 to my daughter @entity73 , my partner and even my own head was itchy with lice			0
' my first thought was embarrassment and disgust			0
i had never had head lice as a child , so to find that the entire family had caught them left me reeling			0
' my partner had heard that the best thing to do was to shave off all the hair , so standing in front of the mirror , he methodically shaved off all of his hair			2
' our son saw him doing it and wanted his hair done as well			2
' @entity14 looked terrible but my partner and i thought it would be the best action to take against the head lice			0
' @entity11 with son @entity14 , five , and @entity73 , one			1
the whole family were infected with nits , but ms @entity11 had the infestation for six months but unfortunately for ms @entity11 , who also has daughter @entity73 , one , there was no remedy that worked for her			1
head lice can usually be effectively treated using medicated lotions or by wet combing , using a specially designed head lice comb she said : ' i went through almost every lotion and potion , asking the pharmacist what the strongest pesticide treatments were , i was that desperate to be rid of them			1
' i tried almost everything and for six months , we went back and forth to the pharmacist for a new treatment			2
i was n’t able to have my hair cut at the hair dressers for the entire six months , because i knew they ’d find the lice in my head and turn me away , it would have been so embarrassing			1
' i was close to pouring a bottle of bleach on my head in a last ditch attempt , the months on end of disgust , constant itching and embarrassment had taken their toll and i was completely fed up			1
' head lice can usually be effectively treated using medicated lotions or by wet combing , using a specially designed head lice comb			2
@entity134 can be used without medicated lotions , but needs to be done regularly and can take a long time to do thoroughly			2
however , no medicated treatment is 100 per cent effective			0
ms @entity11 finally found relief with a medicated lotion called @entity139 , and said she was disgusted - and relieved - when she washed her families hair and watched the dead lice drop out in their hundreds			1
luckily ms @entity11 has remained lice free since the summer , but she says she is well - prepared should they make a come back			1
she said : ' i have a bottle in my bathroom cupboard to catch any quickly if we do have the unwelcome guests come back			0
it will save the family shaving their heads again and i can finally have a haircut ! '			0

@entity11 also spent hundreds on lotions , new bedding and towels as she tried to get rid of them
she did not visit the *hairdressers* for six months and was considering pouring pesticide on her hair
