by @entity0 published : 13:58 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 14:53 est , 21 september 2012 for drivers planning to embark on a journey across snowy terrain , this quirky looking vehicle might seem an unlikely mode of transport			0
but back in 1925 , this @entity7 with a crude set of bright blue skis and chains attached was at the forefront of winter travel			1
it was in 1913 that madcap @entity15 inventor @entity14 hit upon the idea of the ' @entity18 ' kits , which - when attached to a @entity7 - transformed the popular motor car into the world 's first snowmobile			1
crude but effective : a @entity7 motor car fitted with the ' @entity24 - a forerunner of modern snowmobiles the inventor sold his kits for around $ 400 almost a century ago , and now this 1925 example is expected to fetch upwards of £ 10,000 when it goes under the hammer in @entity32 , @entity15 , next month			1
at the time the kits - which consisted of skis made of metal and wood and rear - mounted chain link tracks - were particularly popular with country doctors , who used them to battle the elements when visiting patients in rural areas in winter months			1
relics of winter travel : the chain links were fitted over the wheels of @entity7 cars engine power : makers of the @entity18 kit claimed they enabled vehicles to travel over unbroken snow at a speed of 18mph today the souped - up cars are equally in demand among collectors , and there is even a @entity7 snowmobile owners ' club			1
a spokesman from the club said : ' the snowmobile became an indispensable convenience for the person requiring rapid , dependable transport in all kinds of weather			2
' @entity70 doctors and rural mail carriers were the largest users of this type of vehicle			0
' the spokesman said other customers included public utility companies , lumber firms , travelling salesmen , fire departments , taxi drivers , grocers , milkmen and undertakers			0
' when the father of president @entity86 died on march 18 , 1926 , a @entity84 led the @entity88 funeral procession over the snow - covered hills of @entity91 , ' he added			0
despite their popularity , demand for @entity14 's kits faded with the introduction of the snowplough , and the inventor eventually sold his firm			2
the kits remained in production up until @entity102 ' makers of the attachment claimed the ability to travel over two and a half feet of unbroken snow at an average speed of 18 miles per hour , ' the club spokesman said			2
' those who had a snowmobile certainly used it with great satisfaction			0
' ' indispensable convenience ' : the kits proved useful for country doctors and rural mail carriers			0

' @entity18 ' kits were used to transform @entity7 motor cars into the earliest version of the snowmobile
this restored 1925 version is expected to fetch upwards of £ 10,000 at *auction* in the @entity15 next month
