professor @entity0 , 79 , a leading climate scientist , received emails from around the world condemning his decision to move to a sceptical think - tank a globally - renowned climate scientist has been forced to step down from a think - tank after he was subjected to ' @entity9 ' - style pressure from scientists around the world			1
professor @entity0 , 79 , a leading academic from the @entity12 , left the high - profile @entity13 as a result of the threats , which he described as ' virtually unbearable '			1
the group was set up by former @entity19 chancellor @entity18 and are sceptical about radical policy changes aimed at combating global warming			1
the @entity23 climatologist , who has published more than 200 papers , said he received hundreds of emails from colleagues criticising his decision to switch to the organisation			1
his ' defection ' was described as the biggest switch from the pro-climate change lobby to the sceptic camp to date			2
he was also abused on science blogs , with one describing the people who condemned him as ' respectable ' and that his actions amounted to ' silliness '			0
another described him as a ' crybaby '			0
however , the main pressure came from the @entity39 , where a government employee refused to be a co-author on a paper because of his links to the controversial group			2
prof @entity0 , who had only been in the position for three weeks , told @entity46 : ' there were quite a lot of people who were upset when i joined @entity13			1
' i received emails from colleagues all over the world telling me it was a " questionable " group			1
' but what made me the most upset was when a colleague from the @entity39 resigned as co-author of a paper , simply because i was involved			0
' i thought joining the organisation would provide a platform for me to bring more common sense into the global climate change debate			2
' i have been very concerned about tensions in the climate change community between activists and people who have questions			2
' it has led to a bad atmosphere and a declining level in the quality of science has decreased			0
he believes one of the reasons for this is the @entity78 's expanding role on climate change			1
' the public are concerned that recent weather phenomenon have been as a result of climate change			2
but it is a natural occurrence , ' he said			0
' some people like my views , other people do n't , that is the way when it comes to science			0
' the @entity13 was set up by former @entity19 chancellor @entity18 and is regarded as being part of the ' sceptic camp ' when it comes to climate change in his resignation letter , published on the think - tank 's website , he wrote : ' if this is going to continue i will be unable to conduct my normal work and will even start to worry about my health and safety			1
' i see therefore no other way out therefore than resigning from @entity13			2
i had not expecting such an enormous world - wide pressure put at me from a community that i have been close to all my active life			1
' colleagues are withdrawing their support , other colleagues are withdrawing from joint authorship etc. ' i see no limit and end to what will happen			0
it is a situation that reminds me about the time of @entity115			0
@entity18 , the former @entity19 chancellor condemned the behaviour as ' appalling ' and said the reference to ' @entity118 ' was ' fully warranted '			1
professor @entity0 currently works for the @entity120 at the @entity12 in a letter to @entity122 , he wrote : ' i fully understand your reason ; but it is an appalling state of affairs and your reference to @entity118 is fully warranted			1
' according to the council 's chairman , professor @entity128 it was the ' climate science community in the @entity39 ' which reacted negatively to the appointment			1
the @entity13 has been critical of policies designed to mitigate the impact of climate change			1
a report published by the group earlier this year , by @entity138 and @entity139 , described the teaching of climate science in @entity143 schools as ‘ disturbing ’			2
dr @entity144 , the director of @entity13 told @entity46 : there has been a complete outpouring of disbelief and anger about this development			0
' it 's clearly a growing concern among interested observers how the intolerance within the climate science community is undermining what scientists are saying			0
' this is a major scandal and will backfire if the science community do n't come out in support of him			0
' the @entity13 was started by @entity18 and dr @entity144 in the @entity161 in november 2009			1
it was launched with the @entity162 in mind to create a new dialogue on climatology			0
the think - tank describe themselves as ' open - minded on the contested science of global warming ' , but say they are ' deeply concerned ' with how policies put in place by governments may impact wider society			1
in a joint interview with @entity176 in 2009 , when the @entity178 leader was energy secretary , @entity18 said there had been ‘ no further warming ’ since the @entity181 and dissent should be tolerated			0
@entity176 said @entity18 was ‘ spreading doubt ’ despite a scientific consensus			0
the @entity13 is funded by voluntary donations from a number of private individuals and charitable trusts			0
they do not accept gifts from either energy companies or anyone with a significant interest in the energy industry .			0
