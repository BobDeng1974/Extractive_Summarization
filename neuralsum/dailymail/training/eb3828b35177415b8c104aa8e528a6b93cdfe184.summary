a study suggests the layout of a @entity3 keyboard may play a key part in what parents ' name their new baby			2
the researchers suggest keys on the right hand side are viewed as more positive , while the left is more negative			2
and they found people tend to favour names with letters from the right side of a keyboard - but only since the rise in popularity of the qwerty keyboard in 1990			1
they say the rise in popularity of the qwerty keyboard has meant more names are picked from the right hand side ( shown ) , which are said to be more positive as it is the dominant side for most people the study into the so - called ' qwerty effect ' , reported by @entity36 , was led by psychology professor dr @entity37 from the @entity23			1
previous research from the dr @entity37 said that words typed with the right side of the keyboard were generally viewed as more positive than words on the left side			0
scientists believe this is because many people apparently tend to associate ‘ good ’ with their dominant side - and most people are right - handed			1
the line dividing the keyboard into the left and right side runs between t - y , g - h and b - n. perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the research , though , is that the researchers say baby names have been influenced by the rise of the qwerty keyboard			1
since 1990 , which the team defines as the dawn of the ' modern keyboard era ' , baby names with more right - side keys have apparently been favoured			1
the trend does n’t indicate that every name will be left or right - keyboard oriented , but that a general trend can be noticed			0
the team computed the so - called ‘ right side advantage ’ ( @entity75 ) for every name given to more than 100 babies from 1960 to 2012 according to the @entity73 @entity72			0
this came to a total of 788 unique names			0
‘ we compared the @entity75 of names coined before and after the massive popularisation of @entity3 , ’ the researchers write			0
in the research the team computed the so - called ‘ right side advantage ’ ( @entity75 ) for every name given to more than 100 babies from 1960 to 2012 according to the @entity73 @entity72			0
the increase in the number of right - hand - key letters can be seen in this graph from the researchers however , they note it is difficult to pinpoint the moment the qwerty keyboard became ubiquitous in @entity73 homes , which was where the study focused on			2
‘ we chose the year 1990 as the beginning of the “ qwerty era ” based on a survey of technological landmarks , ’ they write , including the rise in popularity of @entity99 computers and the @entity100			2
and the results seem to show that , over time , names such as @entity108 and @entity109 are preferred to the left - hand dominated counterparts like @entity112 and @entity113			0
as most people are right handed , they pick names from the right hand keys of a keyboard according to the study ( stock image shown ) / and the researchers say the trend can be spotted in baby names picked from 1960 to 2012 , with the year 1990 starting the beginning of the ' qwerty era '			1

a study led by the @entity23 says keyboard layouts have influenced how people name babies
they say the rise in popularity of the qwerty keyboard has meant more names are picked with the *majority* of letters from the right hand keys
this is because most people favour things on their dominant side
as most people are right - handed , they pick names mostly from the right
the trend can apparently be spotted in baby names picked after 1990 when keyboards became commonplace
