a stoppage - time winner from @entity1 saw @entity2 complete an impressive comeback against @entity4 , the striker netting with the last kick of the game to secure a 2 - 1 win			1
@entity1 , preferred off the bench to @entity11 ’s @entity10 , was in the right place at the right time to grab a back - post winner with seconds left on the clock			1
before the dramatic ending it had been @entity20 stars who had taken centre stage as two of @entity24 ’s most star - studded sides played out an entertaining game in @entity26			2
@entity2 's players and substitutes celebrate after @entity1 's last - gasp winner in their match on monday substitute @entity1 ( right ) , who plays his club football for @entity32 , slotted past @entity4 keeper @entity33 @entity1 screams in celebration after stealing three points for @entity2 against @entity4 in the @entity36 2015 @entity4 ( 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 83 ) , a @entity45 ( @entity46 88 ) , @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 68 ) , @entity45 subs not used : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 goal : a @entity45 14 ( pen ) @entity2 ( 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 45 ) , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ( @entity69 85 ) , @entity70 , @entity71 , ( @entity1 79 ) , @entity72 subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity10 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity61 , @entity80 goals : @entity72 58 , @entity1 90 +3 referee : @entity83 @entity72 of @entity84 bagged the equaliser for @entity2 after @entity4 had taken a first half lead through a penalty won by @entity88 ’s @entity48			1
@entity72 , lively throughout , was the quickest to react when his own header came back off the post in the 57th minute , nodding the rebound home from close range			2
in truth , the pacey striker could have had more than just one goal			0
in the first half @entity72 saw a spectacular bicycle kick saved by @entity4 keeper @entity98 , denying him what would have been an early contender for goal of the season			1
then , just minutes after his equaliser , he spurned a simple chance , swinging wildly at a cross with his left foot , but sending high over the bar from close range			0
in the tournament ’s ‘ @entity110 ’ neither side could afford a defeat in the first game , and both seemed set up to avoid conceding , rather than chase the win , in the opening stages			0
@entity2 in particular were keen to sit back and use the pace of @entity84 ’s @entity72 on the break			1
earlier in the game , @entity84 striker @entity72 ( second left ) had levelled the scores at 1 - 1 @entity4 players celebrate after @entity123 netted an early penalty to put them 1 - 0 up against @entity2 @entity45 ( second left ) slots home his penalty in the opening stages to put @entity4 ahead in the @entity129 opener but @entity123 ’s 12th minute penalty changed all that			1
it was won by @entity48 , the winger on loan from @entity134 , showing pace to get to @entity136 ’s through ball ahead of @entity2 keeper @entity138 , who brought him down			2
@entity45 , captaining @entity4 in the absence of @entity141 – missing with @entity142 - chipped home down the middle and ran straight to the dugout to celebrate with his team - mates			2
the goal meant @entity2 had to come out of their shell , leaving space for @entity48 and both @entity151 to attack			0
it was @entity153 who had the most joy , at one point feeding @entity48 after a driving run , only for the winger to curl his shot just wide			0
@entity45 ( right ) spreads his arms in celebration after putting his country ahead in the @entity36 @entity163 , former @entity134 manager , is currently in charge of @entity4 at the @entity36 2015 the @entity165 got off to a good start for @entity45 and @entity4 with an early goal against @entity2 but @entity169 ’s @entity2 side , though not particularly pretty , did look a threat - particularly at set pieces			1
centre - back @entity172 powered a header against the crossbar before @entity72 forced a save from @entity37 with a spectacular bicycle kick			0
neither side were helped by a shocking pitch , the second the competition has seen in two days			0
a bobble denied @entity2 ’s @entity65 an early opportunity , before late on in the first half @entity183 was lucky to make contact with a horribly bobbling back - pass , which he managed to slice away for a corner			0
@entity2 midfielder @entity190 ( right ) sprints away from the challenge of @entity68 @entity72 ( right ) , scorer of @entity2 's equaliser , challenges @entity4 's @entity38 during the game @entity38 ( left ) controls the ball during the @entity196 opener in @entity26 but there was still plenty to admire about the jungle stadium in the remote city of @entity26 , which was packed full of noisy and colourfully dressed fans			1
in the second half they witnessed a @entity2 onslaught , as @entity163 ’s side sat back on their lead			1
but @entity4 never looked comfortable in defence , and @entity72 ’s goal , when it came , was no surprise			1
both sides had chances in the closing stages , @entity213 charging through a non-existent @entity4 defence before dragging his shot wide from just inside the box , before @entity153 put a header wide from seven yards out			0
but , it looked as though both would have to settle for a point until dramatic @entity1 ’s last - gasp winner			0
@entity4 's fans were in full voice as they watched their team take a early lead in @entity226 one fan had painted himself the colours of the @entity230 flag as he watched on from the side of the pitch			2

group c of the @entity36 got *underway* on day 3
@entity4 faced @entity2 in the first game of the group in @entity26
@entity239 's @entity123 opened the scoring for @entity163 's @entity4
@entity84 striker @entity72 levelled the scores with 30 minutes to go
substitute @entity1 won the game for @entity2 in the final seconds
