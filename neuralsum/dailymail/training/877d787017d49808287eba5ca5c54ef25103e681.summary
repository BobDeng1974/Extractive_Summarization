@entity0 has raised questions over @entity3 's tactical preparations after @entity5 's comprehensive defeat against @entity6 in midweek			1
the @entity7 were outplayed in the 2 - 0 loss against @entity6 , and @entity0 suggested that @entity3 may not have watched any videos of the @entity11 side			1
@entity0 claims that @entity5 's attempts to play their own game regardless of the opposition are only useful if they 're winning every game , but need to be adapted under more difficult circumstances			1
@entity17 chases @entity18 as @entity5 were overrun in midfield against @entity6 @entity20 trudges off after another poor performance in which he was denied time and space on the ball @entity5 were outplayed by @entity6 and @entity0 thinks it was down to their preparataion ' i do wonder how much @entity5 look at videos of the opposition in their preparation for games like the one they played on tuesday , ' @entity0 wrote in the @entity34			1
' watching the match it seemed like they hand't given @entity6 much more than a moment 's consideration			1
' @entity40 and @entity5 appear to think about is how they are going to approach the game and how they will play			2
' which is fine if you win all the time but not if - like @entity5 - you have n't made it out of the @entity48 's last 16 for the previous four seasons			1
' @entity3 only cares about how his own team will set up , which is to their detriment , says @entity0 @entity52 scores @entity6 's seconds and the @entity11 could have won by more @entity0 also said @entity20 should n't has been under par on the left wing , but @entity3 has defended his team 's approach , and hit back against criticism of his playmaker			1
' it ’s a bit unfair because i believe that our offensive talents on tuesday night [ against @entity6 ] were not in their best condition , and they could n’t express that talent , ' said @entity3			1
' on the other hand it ’s @entity70			0
he came back on august 11			0
you know it takes a few months for them to get back to their best , that can happen			0
' they should not be concerned and just support him			0
i understand that you want your best players always to make the difference in every single game and we all go through period where we are a bit less good			2
@entity0 says @entity20 should n't be shunted out wide but @entity3 believes he is being made a scapegoat gunners captain and vice captain @entity88 and @entity89 look on during a poor performance ' a club is a union between players , supporters and directors			2
you have to be united and sometimes go through periods together where it goes a bit less well			0
' @entity0 suggested that the formation @entity5 are currently playing , with @entity20 often playing out on the wing , does not suit the @entity11 's talents			1
but @entity3 believes that is merely a side issue			2
' that 's a secondary debate in my opinion because he has freedom to play when we have the ball and go where he wants , ' he added			0
' if you look at the heat map where he plays , you will be amazed where he is all over the pitch			0
@entity20 was out on the wing against @entity6 and failed to have a significant impact on the game despite struggling @entity5 did create chances , but @entity118 missed their best opportunities ' why should he be a scapegoat ? for what ? we 've lost one game since april 1			1
we 've come out of a very difficult preparation period with decisive games			0
we had very difficult games against @entity128			0
i do n't know a scapegoat for what ? ' what is difficult to manage today is that everybody knows absolutely everything and everybody judges people definitely on one game			2
you have to accept that football is played by human beings who have ups and downs like you have in your life			0
