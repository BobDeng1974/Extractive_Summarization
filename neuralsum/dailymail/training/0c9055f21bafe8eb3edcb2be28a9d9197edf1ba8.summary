with his speech in front of the @entity3 today , @entity0 cemented his reputation as one of the world 's highest - profile activists on climate change			1
' you can make history ... or be vilified by it , ' he dramatically told world leaders			1
after marching with 400,000 others on the streets of @entity15 this weekend to demand tough regulations to cut the amount of @entity18 being pumped into the air , @entity0 opened a @entity3 climate change summit by urging the world to crack down on polluters and ' put a price tag on carbon emissions			1
' but the 39 - year - old @entity27 star 's own jetset lifestyle reveals a double - standard on the issue of climate change			1
in his speech to the @entity3 , he said : ' this disaster has grown beyond the choices that individuals make			1
' @entity35 can report that @entity0 took at least 20 trips across the nation and around the world this year alone - including numerous flights from @entity15 to @entity40 and back , a ski vacation to the @entity42 , another vacation to the @entity44 , flights to @entity46 and @entity47 to promote his film @entity48 , two trips to @entity50 and trip to @entity52 to watch the @entity53			1
additionally , @entity0 owns at least four homes : two apartments in @entity15 and mansions in @entity27 and @entity76			1
he also recently sold an estate in @entity78 for $ 17million			2
and this summer , he spent his @entity53 vacation on the fifth largest yacht in the world , a 482 - foot behemoth owned by @entity83 - a billionaire oil tycoon from the @entity85			1
a rep for @entity0 declined to comment for this story			1
@entity0 has tried to stay green in other parts of his life			1
he owns a $ 4million apartment in an eco-friendly apartment building in @entity92			1
he drives a @entity93 and a $ 100,000 @entity95 electric sports car			1
he 's been spotted riding a bike around @entity15			1
in 2007 , he produced and narrated the @entity97 , a documentary about climate change and other threats to the planet			1
he also represents several environmental charities and has thrown his star power behind @entity104 , a new racing circuit that uses electric cars , instead of roaring gasoline - powered vehicles			1
however , his jetsetting - both for business and pleasure - means that he he 's producing a lot more co2 than most people			2
when @entity114 reporter @entity113 confronted @entity0 about his lifestyle , he refused to answer and ms @entity113 was quickly pushed out of the way by a minder expensive toy : @entity0 rented the @entity118 , the fifth largest yacht in the world to sail around @entity52 for his @entity53 trip			1
it is owned by a @entity85 oil tycoon @entity0 , seen here in 2009 , is known to fly in private jets on many of his trips despite flying around the world on private jets , @entity0 has been spotted in @entity15 - seen here in august - riding public @entity130 around town even if he flew on a commercial jet for all of flights , his carbon footprint so far in 2014 would be a minimum of 40million metric tons of @entity18 spewed into the atmosphere , more than twice the average @entity138 output for an entire year			1
that figure only takes into account his flights and assumes that he flew exclusively on commercial airlines			1
the a-list star is worth an estimated $ 220million , according to @entity144 , and it is known to frequently charter private jets			1
carbon emissions for private jets vary , but by some accounts are more than 37 times higher than flying commercial			2
@entity0 was the biggest star at this weekend 's ' @entity67 , ' which drew 400,000 environmental activists to the streets of @entity15			1
@entity0 's @entity153 compound includes two adjoining properties and a custom - built basketball court newest purchase : @entity0 bought this six - bedroom mansion in @entity76 , @entity158 , for $ 5.2million @entity15 digs : @entity0 has owned a pad in the eco-friendly @entity161 building ( left ) in @entity92 since 2008 , but recently snapped up and adjacent apartment for $ 8million			1
he also forked over $ 10million to buy an apartment in the health - minded @entity165 building on @entity167 ( right ) on tuesday , @entity0 tweeted : ' @entity168 into this # climatechange pioneer at the @ unitednations this morning			1
thank you vice president @entity172			0
' he told a reporter from conservative @entity114 media : ' we want to create 100percent clean energy , we need to make a transition in this country and we need to show leadership			2
' and that 's what we 're doing			0
' however , when the reporter asked him about how his jetset lifestyle impacts the environment , she was quickly shunted away from the @entity48 star by a minder			2
today , he addressed the @entity3 @entity190 and told world leaders : ' my friends , this body - perhaps more than any other gathering in human history - now faces that difficult task			1
' you can make history ... or be vilified by it			1
' he urged them : ' we need to put a pricetag on carbon emissions , and eliminate government subsidies for coal , gas , and oil companies			2
we need to end the free ride that industrial polluters have been given in the name of a free - market economy , they do n't deserve our tax dollars , they deserve our scrutiny			2
' @entity0 met @entity3 secretary general @entity218 thank you , mr. @entity220 , your excellencies , ladies and gentleman , and distinguished guests			1
i ’m honored to be here today , i stand before you not as an expert but as a concerned citizen , one of the 400,000 people who marched in the streets of @entity15 on sunday , and the billions of others around the world who want to solve our climate crisis			1
as an actor i pretend for a living			0
i play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems			0
i believe humankind has looked at @entity241 in that same way : as if it were a fiction , happening to someone else ’s planet , as if pretending that @entity241 was n’t real would somehow make it go away			2
but i think we know better than that			0
every week , we ’re seeing new and undeniable @entity248 , evidence that accelerated @entity241 is here now			0
we know that droughts are intensifying , our oceans are warming and acidifying , with methane plumes rising up from beneath the ocean floor			0
we are seeing extreme weather events , increased temperatures , and the @entity257 and @entity258 ice - sheets melting at unprecedented rates , decades ahead of scientific projections			2
none of this is rhetoric , and none of it is hysteria			0
the scientific community knows it , @entity271 and governments know it , even the @entity138 military knows it			0
the chief of the @entity276 ’s @entity275 , admiral @entity274 , recently said that @entity241 is our single greatest security threat			0
my friends , this body - perhaps more than any other gathering in human history - now faces that difficult task			2
you can make history ... or be vilified by it			1
to be clear , this is not about just telling people to change their light bulbs or to buy a hybrid car			2
this disaster has grown beyond the choices that individuals make			0
this is now about our industries , and governments around the world taking decisive , large - scale action			2
i am not a scientist , but i do n't need to be			0
because the world ’s scientific community has spoken , and they have given us our prognosis , if we do not act together , we will surely perish			0
now is our moment for action we need to put a pricetag on carbon emissions , and eliminate government subsidies for coal , gas , and oil companies			0
we need to end the free ride that industrial polluters have been given in the name of a free - market economy , they do n't deserve our tax dollars , they deserve our scrutiny			0
for the economy itself will die if our eco-systems collapse			0
the good news is that renewable energy is not only achievable but good economic policy			0
new research shows that by 2050 clean , renewable energy could supply 100 % of the world ’s energy needs using existing technologies , and it would create millions of jobs			0
this is not a partisan debate ; it is a human one			0
clean air and water , and a livable climate are inalienable human rights			2
and solving this crisis is not a question of politics			0
it is our moral obligation - if , admittedly , a daunting one … we only get one planet			0
@entity345 must become accountable on a massive scale for the wanton destruction of our collective home			0
protecting our future on this planet depends on the conscious evolution of our species			0
this is the most urgent of times , and the most urgent of messages			0
honored delegates , leaders of the world , i pretend for a living			0
the people made their voices heard on sunday around the world and the momentum will not stop			0
and now it ’s your turn , the time to answer the greatest challenge of our existence on this planet ... is now			0
i beg you to face it with courage			0
