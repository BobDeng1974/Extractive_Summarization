by @entity0 last updated at 11:52 am on 29th june 2011 @entity2 presidential candidate @entity1 is probably already growing tired with the @entity4 comparisons to @entity5			1
but it seems she is already following in mrs @entity5 ’s footsteps of making unfortunate public gaffes after pulling a clanger in a television interview			2
mrs @entity1 , 55 , said she would work in the ' spirit of @entity12 from @entity13 ' - who is not the actor , but the serial killer @entity16			1
oops : @entity1 , 55 , said she would work in the spirit of @entity12 - but the @entity12 from her home town is the serial killer @entity16 she used her home town of @entity13 , @entity20 , to launch her official campaign to become the @entity2 presidential candidate in the 2012 election			1
‘ well what i want them to know is just like , @entity12 was from @entity13 , @entity20			1
that 's the kind of spirit that i have too , ’ she told @entity24			2
the actor @entity12 , born @entity12 , was from @entity30 , which is still in @entity20 - but around 150 miles away from @entity13			1
@entity16 , also known as the ' @entity31 ' , was executed in 1994 for raping and murdering more than 30 boys and young men			1
mixed up : @entity12 , left , was an actor born in @entity30 , @entity20 , but @entity16 , right , was a serial killer who came to @entity13 , @entity20 , from @entity34 , @entity35 @entity16 was born in @entity34 , @entity35 , before moving to @entity13 , where he lived for a short time and also had his first criminal conviction			1
it was for an attempted homosexual assault and it landed him in prison for 18 months , reported the @entity41			0
he then moved back to @entity42 and began his six - year killing spree between 1972 and 1978 before being later convicted and sentenced to death			2
' we can not afford four more years of @entity46			0
make no mistake about it , @entity46 will be a one - term president			1
mr president , your policies have n't worked ( and ) spending our way out of the recession has n't worked ' @entity54 2012 presidential candidate mrs @entity1 's team have since tried to clear up what she meant , saying that @entity12 's parents lived in @entity13 , although their son did not			1
they moved to @entity30 before he was born , reported @entity62			1
the outspoken @entity4 favourite also tore into president @entity46 as she sought to capitalise on soaring poll ratings and cast herself as the ' bold choice ' for a @entity2 president			1
after a week of winning right - wing praise for hardline opinions on subjects from energy - saving light bulbs to gay marriage , the @entity68 congresswoman told supporters : ' we ca n't afford four more years of @entity46 '			1
the 55 - year - old was in her native @entity20 to launch an official bid , with surprise polls predicting her as a force in the state that opens the @entity2 nomination contest , putting her well ahead with @entity82			1
outside a historic mansion in @entity13 , mrs @entity1 said she is waging her campaign ' not for vanity ' , but because voters ' must make a bold choice if we are to secure the promise of the future '			1
' we ca n't afford four more years of @entity46 , ' she said			0
' ( @entity90 ) will be a one - term president			2
mr president , your policies have n't worked ( and ) spending our way out of the recession has n't worked			0
great setting : mrs @entity1 speaks to supporters during her announcement outside a historic mansion waving : mrs @entity1 and her husband @entity99 stood together after she addressed supporters ' we can not afford four more years of millions of @entity102 who are out of work and are not making enough in wages to support a family			2
' we ca n't afford the unconstitutional health care law that costs so much and delivers so little			0
' the liberals , and to be clear i am not one of those , want you to believe the @entity4 movement is just the right wing of the @entity2			1
nothing could be further from the truth			0
' our problems do n't have an identity of party , they are problems that were created by both parties			0
@entity102 are n't interested in affiliation , they 're interested in solutions			0
' meanwhile , her amped - up looks and wardrobe choices are causing a stir in the fashion world , with a carefully - considered pale grey dress and matching jacket outfit seen as tasteful and understated			2
after the formal @entity20 kick - off , she plans to shift her focus to @entity133 and @entity135 - other states with traditions of separating the viable contenders from the political also - rans			1
mrs @entity1 ’s hardline approach to issues such as gay marriage has already seen her declare she would issue a constitutional amendment to make marriage between a man and a woman only			1
her ideologies have earned her a loyal following but also plenty of guff from those who see her as a fringe politician - and many analysts say she has a me - against - the - world view of politics			2
‘ her trick is going to be to maintain that boldness and to somehow reign it in and discipline it so it works for her and not against her , ’ @entity2 pollster @entity156 said			1
‘ she 's a hell of a lot closer to where the party is right now than where ( the other candidates are )			0
’ so to shore up her campaign she has recruited aides in @entity20 and @entity133 who worked on the campaigns of previous presidential hopefuls @entity169 and @entity170			1
she insists her combative style will give her something different to her measured rivals such as governors @entity82 , @entity175 and @entity176 and former house speaker @entity177			1
audience : @entity1 , who was born in @entity13 , @entity20 , will continue her announcement tour this week with stops in @entity133 and @entity135 applause : @entity1 , pictured right with her husband @entity99 , enjoyed a rapturous reception ‘ i 've been consistent , nothing but consistent , ’ mrs @entity1 said			1
‘ i do n't say things for political value			0
i 'm authentic in what i say			0
’ other candidates are ex-senator @entity188 , @entity190 rep. @entity189 and businessman @entity191			0
@entity190 governor @entity192 and 2008 vice presidential nominee @entity5 could also join			0
mrs @entity1 has risen to fame by trying to block and now promising to repeal president @entity46 's healthcare law - as well as saying @entity196 leaders are too timid on federal spending cuts			2
she also believes in more abortion restrictions and constitutional amendments to ban gay marriage , as well as having a strong belief in family values after raising five children and 23 foster kids			1
however she can be fierce , accusing president @entity46 of pushing the country towards socialism - and is known by her opponents to be unwilling to budge on her views , even in tough races			1
‘ she 's not a manoeuverer			0
at the end of the day she is going to distinguish herself by going out there and trying to draw people to her , ’ said @entity211 , a @entity2 involved in @entity68 politics			1
@entity20 strength : polls are predicting mrs @entity1 , left , to be a force in the state that opens the @entity2 nomination contest and putting her well ahead of the chasing pack with @entity82 , right opinions : mrs @entity1 has a hardline approach to issues such as energy - saving lightbulbs and gay marriage democrat @entity228 , who lost to her in a 2008 congressional race , said he was frustrated that the more controversial mrs @entity1 came off , the stronger she seemed to get			1
‘ she can say something that 's just outrageous and just completely wrong and move on and never skip a beat ' former competitor @entity228 her comments often fuel a fundraising machine that netted her $ 13.5 million for her last election			0
‘ she can say something that 's just outrageous and just completely wrong and move on and never skip a beat , ’ mr @entity228 said			0
@entity4 members are seeking purity from the @entity2 candidates and have reacted sceptically to those largely linked to the party power brokers , particularly mr @entity82			1
but she has already provoked the fury of green campaigners after joining with senior @entity2 in vowing to repeal a law on energy - saving light bulbs because they believe it breaches human rights			1
the 2007 law , which is set from january to introduce energy efficiency standards for light bulbs , is being contested by more than a dozen right - wing politicians , including mrs @entity1			2
tender moment : mrs @entity1 has been married to @entity99 for 33 years and they have five children big support : mrs @entity1 has risen to fame by trying to block and now promising to repeal president @entity46 's healthcare law - as well as saying @entity196 leaders are too timid on federal spending cuts ' the government has no business telling an individual what kind of light bulb to buy , ' mrs @entity1 said while introducing her ' @entity267 ' earlier this year			2
mrs @entity1 hit back after @entity268 asked her on @entity24 if she is a ' flake '			0
' i think that would be insulting to say something like that because i 'm a serious person , ' she said			0
' i 'm 55 years old			0
' i 've been married 33 years			0
i 'm not only a lawyer , i have a post-doctorate degree in federal tax law from @entity276			0
' i 've worked in serious scholarship , my husband and i have raised five kids , we 've raised 23 foster children			0
' we 've applied ourselves to education reform			0
we started a charter school for at - risk kids			2
i 've also been a state senator and member of the @entity286 for five years			2
' mr @entity268 has since admitted he ' messed up ' with the question and ' did n't mean any disrespect '			0
she added at a party gathering in june : ' president @entity1 will allow you to buy any light bulb you want in the @entity102			0
' mrs @entity1 has also come out against gay marriage as a new same - sex law was approved in @entity295 , but also said it was up to individual states to decide whether they allowed it			2
' every time it 's going on the ballot , the people have decided to keep the traditional definition , ' she said			0
' after all , the family is the fundamental unit of government			2
' mrs @entity1 has also said ' scare tactics ' are being used by those warning of an economic calamity unless @entity286 raises the government 's borrowing limit by an august deadline			0
she claimed the @entity102 could avoid a default by paying only the interest on @entity102 obligations while lawmakers work on a deal to cut spending dramatically as part of a new debt ceiling			0
in an @entity20 poll of @entity2 candidates conducted for the @entity325 , former @entity322 governor @entity82 is ahead with support from 23 per cent - but mrs @entity1 is close on 22 per cent .			1
