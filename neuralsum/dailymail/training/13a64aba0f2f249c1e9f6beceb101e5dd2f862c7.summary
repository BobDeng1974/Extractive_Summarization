by @entity1 reporter published : 06:47 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 08:10 est , 22 february 2013 they are famous for going mad in march – but it seems this pair of mountain hares simply could not wait the extra two weeks			2
the animals were photographed tussling in the @entity7 in @entity8 , and despite still being in their white winter coats their antics are a sign that spring is finally on its way			1
while it is often thought that boxing takes place solely between males vying for dominance , this particular battle involved an angry female fighting of unwanted male attention			1
springing into action : these two hares were spotted sparring in the @entity7 , @entity8 , by photographer @entity23 angry : the female ( pictured on the right of the pair ) appears unhappy with the attention shown by the male hare glutton for punishment : the determined male continues to try his luck before giving up and running back down the hill to work his charms on a different female the pictures were taken by photographer @entity23 , 42 , who lives near @entity37			1
he said : ‘ boxing hares are an early indication that spring is just around the corner			1
' i was out looking for mountain hares in the snow when i happened to spot this pair looking very alert and experience told me that their behaviour was a little bit different to normal			2
' i sat and watched them for about 20 minutes before the action began , the male hare ( the @entity48 ) began by running around the female ( the @entity52 ) in a tight circle before he made his move			1
' ' she was having none if it and proceeded to repel his advances with a series of high leaps and what looked like kick boxing moves			0
' mr @entity23 said this happened twice before the male shot off down the slope to work his charms on another female who was sitting close by			2
sign : the mountain hares are still wearing their winter white coats - but their sparring shows spring is in the air unusual : fights between hares usually involve two males battling for the chance to mate with a female the male is the one on the left , rearing up and running in circles , ' said mr @entity23 , ' the female is the one on the right doing the ninja moves and dishing out the punishment			1
@entity84 was in the air but not for him			0
' the mountain hare differs from the more common brown hare by getting a white coat for the winter			0
they go through three changes during the year , from october to january they change from brown with a greyish blue twinge to almost full white			2
from february until may their coats become a mottled brown and white before reverting back to the full summer brown with a white tail			0
in 1906 @entity101 were given a separate subspecies of @entity103			0
mr @entity23 said : ' looking for white hares in snow is by no means an easy task			0
from my own experiences finding mountain hares , let alone photographing them does take research , a lot of time and bags of effort			0
