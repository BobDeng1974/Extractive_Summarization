by @entity0 last updated at 8:22 am on 2nd december 2011 oops : presidential hopeful @entity2 said she wanted to shut the non-existent @entity3 in @entity4 , but later moved to say she was speaking hypothetically @entity4 is proving a real thorn in the side of @entity8 politicians in recent days			1
but this time it 's less to do with the provocative muscle - flexing of the @entity13 country 's top brass and more to do with some rather embarrassing gaps in the foreign policy knowledge of their @entity8 counterparts			1
first it was president @entity18 who slipped up when he spoke out to denounce the attack on the ' @entity21 in @entity22 when it 's actually @entity23			1
now one of the candidates looking to oust him from power next year , @entity2 , has revealed her plans to close the @entity3 in the @entity13 country despite @entity8 not having one there since 1980			1
@entity2 's own ' oops ' moment came while applauding @entity23 's decision to pull its nationals out of its embassy after students stormed the building in protest earlier this week			0
according to reports , the @entity39 presidential candidate told a crowd in @entity42 , @entity43 , yesterday : ' that ’s exactly what i would do [ if i were president ]			1
we would n’t have an embassy in @entity4			0
i would n’t allow that to be there			0
' the @entity8 cut all diplomatic ties with the country during a crisis in which 52 @entity8 were held hostage for 444 days between november 4 , 1979 and january 20 , 1981			2
her gaffe quickly did the rounds online			2
@entity58 tweeted : ' @entity2 , who is on the @entity59 , says she will close our @entity4 @entity3 if elected			0
' it was n't long before her campaign went into damage - limitation mode by saying her comments were ' hypothetical '			0
gaffe : president @entity18 speaking in @entity68 yesterday			1
the previous day he wrongly referred to the ' @entity21 in @entity22			1
he then blundered again when calling it ' the embassy of the @entity23 ' when it is @entity23 a statement said : ' she is fully aware that we do not have an embassy in @entity4 and have not had one since 1980			0
' she was agreeing with the actions taken by the @entity23 to secure their embassy personnel and was speaking in the hypothetical , that if she was @entity79 and if we had an embassy in @entity4 , she would have taken the same actions as the @entity23			0
' ms @entity2 's comments follow a number of outspoken attacks on @entity4 in recent weeks - one time making the false claim that the @entity13 country had threatened to launch nuclear warheads at the @entity8 and @entity89			1
ms @entity2 has previously boasted how she had not made a ' gaffe or something that i 've done that has caused me to fall in the polls ' and has been defiant in claiming that voters were more concerned about jobs and the economy than an occasional blunder by a candidate			2
word play : both mr @entity18 and ms @entity2 slipped up while denouncing the violence in @entity22 when students stormed the @entity23 embassy earlier this week those comments came after she once told a crowd in @entity106 , @entity107 , that it was @entity109 's birthday when it was actually the anniversary of his death			1
and when she kicked off her presidential campaign in june in @entity112 , @entity43 , she called it the home of @entity8 actor @entity114 when the town was actually home for a time to serial killer @entity117			2
in opposing mr @entity18 's foreign policy in october , she also said : ' he put us in @entity120			1
he is now putting us in @entity121			0
' we already were stretched too thin , and he put our special operations forces in @entity121			0
' @entity120 is , in fact , a country in @entity121			2
she is not the only presidential hopeful to get her tongue tied , however.earlier this month , @entity127 was left squirming as he struggled with a question about his stance on @entity120			1
tongue - tied : @entity39 presidential hopefuls @entity127 ( left ) and @entity131 ( right ) have made their own high - profile gaffes during their campaign trails he firstly had to clarify whether mr @entity18 had actually supported the uprising before stumbling through an answer			1
it came just days after @entity131 goofed in a @entity39 debate after being asked to name three departments he would cut			0
the federal departments that would be gone if he was president , @entity131 started on live tv were @entity141 - but then he could n’t get the third			2
' @entity142 and , let ’s see , ' he said			0
the third one , i ca n’t			0

presidential hopeful makes gaffe while *outlining* her policy on @entity13 country
