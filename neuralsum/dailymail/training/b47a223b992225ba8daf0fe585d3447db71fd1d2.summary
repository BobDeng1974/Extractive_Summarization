by @entity0 published : 12:19 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 15:22 est , 8 september 2012 a baby girl born with half a heart survived despite the fact her life - threatening condition was not diagnosed until she reached four months old			1
@entity5 was born with rare @entity6 ( @entity7 ) - where the right side of the heart is underdeveloped - meaning her body was unable to pump enough blood to her lungs			1
few of the 600 babies diagnosed with the condition every year survive , with many dying within days of birth			1
survivor : @entity16 was born with a rare life - threatening condition that went undiagnosed until she was over four months old but fighter @entity16 , from @entity19 , is beating the odds despite the delay in detecting her condition			1
ordinarily @entity7 in a baby would be picked up by the 22 - week scan carried out on expectant mothers			2
but it was n't until @entity16 's mother @entity27 spotted the difference in temperament between @entity16 and her older brother @entity30 , 23 months , that she began to suspect there was a problem			2
' @entity34 is such a happy wee boy , everybody knows how happy he is , ' the primary school teacher said			2
' but i think people started to think : " she 's wild " , because @entity16 was just so unhappy and screamed all the time			2
' the 28 - year - old eventually made a breakthrough while talking to a guide leader who was also a paediatrician about @entity16 's constant crying and sleepless nights			0
after a quick examination , @entity27 was advised to take her daughter to @entity47 in @entity19			0
@entity16 was immediately whisked to intensive care after an assessment at the hospital , and a treatment plan drawn up			0
doctors told @entity27 her daughter had overcome all the odds to make it so far without treatment			0
' it was unbelievable , ' said @entity27			0
' from having a child that you think is healthy to this			0
i thought at worst she might have asthma			0
' ' it is a miracle she is still here , ' said @entity16 's mum			0
' the doctors ca n't really believe how a child can get to four and a half months with that condition			1
' @entity71 's condition would be picked up at the 22 - week scan			1
in the days before scans the babies would go home and just succumb to the condition			1
' happy family : @entity16 pictured with big brother @entity30 , 23 months , dad @entity78 , 30 , and mum @entity27 , 28 @entity16 has since come through two major heart operations during which doctors spent hours rerouting major arteries directly to her lungs to improve her flow of oxygen			1
the tot 's turnaround has been so remarkable her doctors are now hoping she will enjoy a relatively normal childhood , although it is likely @entity16 will need to undergo a heart transplant by the time she reaches her early teens			1
' she 's never going to be an athlete , ' her mum said			0
the rare syndrome puts extra strain on the working side of the heart as it compensates for the defective heart			1
this strain eventually leads to the organ wearing out			2
@entity27 , with help from @entity16 's dad @entity78 , 30 , and her family , has organised a charity ball in @entity16 's name to raise money for @entity47			0
she is hoping the ball , which aims to raise thousands for new equipment at the hospital , will become an annual event .			0

@entity5 suffers from @entity6 , where the right side of the organ is underdeveloped
many babies diagnosed with the rare condition die within days of birth
since her diagnosis @entity120 has undergone two major heart operations
