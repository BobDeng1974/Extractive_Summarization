fashion icons such as @entity1 may have created a trend for prominent eyebrows this year , but it seems nobody told @entity6 leader @entity5			1
while giving his annual @entity10 speech in @entity11 yesterday , the dictator 's brows appeared significantly smaller than when he gave the same address in 2013			1
images captured from both events show the brows have become further apart and significantly shorter in what appears to be a case of severe over-plucking			2
the disappearing brows were spotted by eagle - eyed viewers as @entity5 gave his speech on @entity39 , announcing possible diplomatic talks between @entity41			1
in a televised address from the country 's capital , @entity5 spoke of the possibility of ' high - level ' negotiations , ' if the atmosphere and conditions are met			1
' however he went on to blame the @entity50 and @entity51 for tension on the peninsula , while making vague promises to improve the country 's economy by pursuing science and technology			0
trend setter : it is not clear whether @entity5 plans to make the rest of the country follow his lead , as he did earlier this year after ordering all men to have their hair cut in his signature style @entity39 : during his address @entity5 raised the prospect of high - level talks with @entity41 in 2015 , but only ' if the atmosphere and conditions are met			1
' the 30 - minute speech was the third @entity5 has delivered since he came to power , but the first after the end of the traditional three - year mourning of the death of his father , @entity77 , in late 2011			1
the sister of @entity6 leader @entity5 has married the son of one of the country 's most powerful officials , @entity41 's @entity79 news agency said today			1
@entity85 , who is 27 or 28 , was said by state media late last year to have assumed a senior position in the ruling @entity88			0
she is the only other member of the ruling @entity5 family known to have an official job within the government , other than @entity5			2
a @entity93 source said : ' as far as i know , @entity85 , deputy director of the @entity88 , got married to a son of the party secretary @entity96			0
' according to the source , the lucky man is @entity99 , second son of @entity100			0
the elder @entity96 is a high - ranking member of the @entity88 and widely seen as a close confidant of supreme ruler @entity5			2
@entity85 was seen wearing what appears to be a wedding ring in a photo released by the reclusive @entity6 's official @entity106 news agency today			0
analysts believe that , with his father removed from the nation 's consciousness , the younger @entity5 will begin to pursue policies more in keeping with his own set of views			2
it has been a bad year for @entity5 , who has been plagued by health problems , and for @entity6 as a whole , which has become even more isolated from the world in the wake of the @entity120 hacks			2
@entity5 disappeared from public for three weeks in september , missing several key state events , after being pictured limping during one televised appearance			1
observers suggested that he may have been deposed by high ranking military generals , but military spokesmen insisted he was only ' suffering from discomfort ' due to a medical condition			0
that condition was later theorised to be gout brought on by eating vast quantities of cheese , especially imported @entity133 , which is said to be his favourite			0
relations between @entity6 and @entity51 have ended the year at a low point after @entity138 was hacked , a crime blamed on the communist nation			0
the release of sensitive employee information and embarrassing email exchanges by high - level executives was seen to be in retaliation for film @entity146 , which depicts the assassination of @entity5			0
while @entity6 has denied responsibility , it praised the hacking as a ' righteous act '			0
several days later the country 's entire internet was brought offline for a day in a suspected retaliatory move by @entity51 authorities , although again nobody has accepted responsibility			0
@entity5 seems to have started 2015 in a positive mood , however , and was pictured visiting an orphanage in @entity11 today , where he was pictured smiling and playing with the children			1
positive start : shrugging off the health problems during 2014 , @entity5 got this year off to a more cheerful start by visiting an orphanage in @entity11 picture of innocence : the dictator was given a tour of the facilities , while offering operational guidance to the carers working there			1

@entity5 gave annual address from @entity11 on @entity39
observers noticed brows have shrunk significantly since 2013 speech
today he was pictured smiling with children while visiting an orphanage
