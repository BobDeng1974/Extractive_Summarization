city dwellers have noticed emboldened foxes for years			0
but now a new study claims that humans and the urban environments that they have created have affected the evolution of a whole host of species - triggering the growth of enormous spiders , the shrinking of fish and the emergence of birds with no fear of man			1
and the changes are happening faster than previously thought which ‘ may have significant implications for ecological and human well - being , ’ according to one expert			1
a new study claims that animals living in cities have evolved rapidly because of human influence			0
for example , @entity27 ( b ) have become smaller , blackbirds ( d ) have changed their migratory behaviour , @entity29 ( e ) disperses less seeds in built - up areas , earthworms ( f ) have become tolerant to metal , while white - footed mice in @entity36 are carrying more ticks , leading to increased cases of @entity39 in humans @entity41 , of the @entity42 , said that until recently , it was assumed that evolutionary change would take too long to affect ecological processes immediately			1
‘ we now have evidence that there is rapid evolution			2
these changes may affect the state of the environment now			0
this is what 's called eco-evolutionary feedback , ’ she said			0
professor @entity41 explained that the number and variety of animals living in cities has not simply decreased , but humans are causing them to evolve rapidly			1
she has reviewed evidence of ‘ human signatures ’ - or examples of changes in fish , birds , mammals and plants - caused by man in her study , which is published in the journal @entity72			2
professor @entity41 explained that the number and variety of animals living in cities such as @entity36 ( stock picture ) have not simply decreased , but humans are causing them to evolve rapidly experts from the @entity79 , @entity77 discovered that golden orb weaver spiders ( stock image is shown ) living in urban areas of @entity83 were larger and had more babies than their rural relatives , and that an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame ‘ many species of mammals , birds , fishes , and insects have learned novel behaviours , such as diet , foraging skills , and anti-predator behaviour , ’ the study says			1
for example , it cites research that found the bodies of fish changed in response to the construction of dams and that @entity108 salmon have become smaller in urban areas			1
in contrast , a study published in august last year found that spiders are growing larger in cities than in rural environments			2
experts from the @entity79 , @entity77 discovered that golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of @entity83 were larger and had more babies than their rural relatives , and that an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame			2
professor @entity41 said that changes in animals have an effect on ‘ ecosystem functions such as biodiversity , nutrient cycling , seed dispersal , detoxification , food production and ultimately on human health and well - being			2
’ in addition to the growing spiders and shrinking salmon , she cited earthworms with increased tolerance to metals and seeds of some plants dispersing less effectively			1
this diagram shows how changing urban environments influence eco-evolutionary dynamics			1
changes in animals happens through a series of subtle mechanisms including changes in habitat , biotic interactions , disturbance and social dynamics some whitefooted mice in the @entity36 were found to be a ‘ critical host ’ for black - legged ticks ( pictured left ) that carry the bacterium ( shown right ) that causes lyme disease a study published in august last year found that spiders are growing larger in cities than in rural environments			2

' our findings show the impact urbanisation can have on local wildlife , ' said said @entity165 of the @entity79			0
' while many species do not survive encroaching urbanisation and the consequent loss of native habitat , others have a more complex relationship with man - made changes to the landscape			0
' the researchers collected golden orb - weaving spiders ( @entity177 ) from across the @entity178			0
' we quantified the degree of urbanisation of 20 sites then looked at changes in the spiders ' body size , fat reserves and ovary weight , ' ms @entity165 said			0
the results show spiders in areas with more vegetation cover had smaller bodies and larger bodies when located in urbanised areas			0
the authors also found that the spiders ' reproductive ability , measured by increased ovary weight , appeared to increase in urban areas			2
earthworms have adapted genetically to a series of soil contaminates , including arsenic , and certain plants also have also developed an increased tolerance for heavy metals in brownfield sites in cities			1
the study mentions research that found the weed @entity212 disperses a significantly lower proportion of its seeds in urban patches than in undisturbed surroundings and that the seeds of @entity218 are less able to disperse by wind in cities			1
worryingly , the study also points to evidence of changes in a type of urban mouse , that may have health consequences for humans			1
some white - footed mice in @entity36 were found to be a ‘ critical host ’ for black - legged ticks that carry the bacterium that causes @entity39			0
the 2013 study by researchers from the universities of @entity36 , @entity234 and @entity235 , was the first to report changes to genes as the result of humans and urbanisation			0
professor @entity41 ’s study says that thriving mouse populations allow more ticks to survive and lead to predictable spikes in human exposure to the illness			0
it also discusses how songbirds are becoming tamer and bolder , as well as changing their tunes to ensure their acoustic signals are not lost in the noisy urban background			0
for example , great tits are among bird species that have changed the frequency of their notes to adapt to the noise present in urban environments			1
the shapes of songbirds ’ wings has even evolved in response to forest fragmentation in @entity265 , according to research by @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 in @entity36			0
great tits are among bird species that have changed the frequency of their notes to adapt to the noise present in urban environments , while @entity275 blackbirds have become more sedentary @entity275 blackbirds have been found to be becoming sedentary and have changed their migratory behaviour in response to urbanisation			1
professor @entity41 said that humans in cities cause the changes in a number of ways			1
for example , cities disrupt vegetation patterns , create toxic pollutants and increase the temperature , meaning that animals have to adapt rapidly to survive			0
noise and light pollution can also drive change in animal behaviour , while the presence of humans changes the availability of resources such as food and water , altering the life cycle of many species			1
the study says : ‘ humans are major selective agents with potential for unprecedented evolutionary consequences for @entity306 ’s ecosystems , especially as cities expand rapidly			0
’ while the research may seem bleak , professor @entity41 does not have a ‘ catastrophic ’ perspective but says her work highlights that humans have a unique opportunity to shape the evolution of the @entity306			1
‘ we can drive urbanising ecosystems to collapse or we can consciously steer them toward a resilient and sustainable future , ’ she said .			0

professor at the @entity42 analysed previous animal research *focused* on urban environments
cited shrinking salmon , changes in birds ' songs and migratory habits , and worms ' tolerance to metals , for example , as evolution driven by humans
the changes are happening faster than previously thought
