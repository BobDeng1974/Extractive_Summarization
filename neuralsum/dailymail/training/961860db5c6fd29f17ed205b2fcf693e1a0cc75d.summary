by @entity0 a @entity2 inmate has been put to death for raping and killing a college student , making him the first @entity6 prisoner put to death since the @entity9 lethal injection went horrendously awry last month			1
the @entity10 said @entity11 was executed by lethal injection at the state prison and was pronounced dead at 12.11am yesterday			1
he is the seventh @entity2 inmate to be executed this year			2
@entity11 had been sentenced to death for the attack on 24 - year - old @entity16 during a burglary of her @entity19 condominium in 1995			1
offered no apology : @entity11 was executed in @entity2 for raping and killing a student despite an appeal to the @entity23 to delay the death sentence because of recent botched executions before the execution began , while strapped to a gurney and covered with a sheet , @entity11 spoke with his witnesses — some of them his relatives — through the glass , raising his shaved head			1
when the drugs began flowing , his head lowered back to the pillow and he appeared to breathe heavily for about 15 seconds before closing his eyes			2
some of his witnesses began crying after he fell unconscious			2
a @entity38 had been placed on his chest at his request , and he left a six - sentence written statement offering no apology			0
the @entity6 @entity23 and @entity2 's governor had declined on tuesday to block the execution			2
@entity11 , 43 , had predicted that the nation 's high court and governor @entity47 would not spare him , insisting in a telephone interview with the @entity50 news agency that he had accepted his fate			1
' i figure i 'll wake up in a better place tomorrow , ' @entity11 , formerly of @entity54 in central @entity55 , had said tuesday			1
' i 'm just accepting of whatever 's going to happen because i have no choice			0
the courts do n't seem to care about what 's right or wrong anymore			0
' killer : @entity61 gasped for two hours when was executed by lethal injection in @entity9 last month @entity11 's attorneys had pressed the @entity23 to put off his execution , citing the @entity9 execution and two others that were botched in @entity67 and @entity68 as well as the secrecy involving the drugs used during the process in @entity2			1
those three executions in recent months have renewed the debate over lethal injection			1
in @entity9 , the inmate gasped more than 600 times and took nearly two hours to die			1
in april , an @entity68 inmate died of an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after his execution began			1
and in january , an @entity67 inmate snorted and gasped for 26 minutes before dying			1
most lethal injections take effect in a fraction of that time , often within 10 or 15 minutes			2
@entity9 , @entity68 and @entity67 all use midazolam , a drug more commonly given to help patients relax before surgery			1
in executions , it is part of a two - or three - drug lethal injection			0
@entity90 and @entity2 instead administer a single large dose of pentobarbital — often used to treat convulsions and seizures and to euthanize animals			0
@entity2 changed to pentobarbital late last year and since has carried out executions during which inmates showed no obvious signs of distress			0
@entity2 and @entity90 have turned to compounding pharmacies to make versions of pentobarbital			0
but like most states , they refuse to name their drug suppliers , creating a shroud of secrecy that has prompted lawsuits			0
in denying @entity11 's clemency request , @entity47 called @entity11 's rape and killing of @entity112 ' horrific , ' noting that ' there is no question about the brutality of this crime — or doubt of @entity11 's guilt			1
' @entity11 was sentenced to death in 1998 after pleading guilty to @entity112 's death , confessing that in september 1995 he cut open a window screen to break in to the college finance major 's condominium in @entity19 , just west of @entity124			1
@entity11 admitted he choked @entity112 into submission and raped her before strangling her when she regained consciousness			1
he stole her car keys and jewelry , along with credit cards he used to buy drugs			2
dna tests later linked @entity11 to the slaying			1
@entity11 , much as he did after his arrest , insisted to the @entity50 on tuesday from his holding cell near the death chamber that he could n't remember details of the killing and that he was prone to blackouts due to alcohol and cocaine abuse			1
campaign : three bungled executions in recent months have renewed the debate over lethal injections he said a life prison sentence would have been more appropriate for him			1
' in 20 years , no one 's seen or heard from me , ' he said			0
' if i 'm the one who did it , what do they think life without parole is — a piece of cake ? on tuesday , @entity112 's 76 - year - old parents anticipated witnessing @entity11 die			2
' it 's been 19 years , and i feel like there 's going to be a finality , ' @entity112 's mother , @entity159 said after flying to @entity2 from their @entity164 home			0
' i wo n't have to ever deal with the name @entity11 again			2
i 'm hoping for my family 's sake , my sake , that we can go there ( to the prison ) and get this over with			0
' ' in this case , there is no question in anyone 's mind he did it , so why does it take 18 or 19 years to go through with this ? ' added @entity179 , @entity112 's father			0
' this drags on and on			0
at this point , it 's ridiculous , and hopefully it 's going to end			0
' @entity11 , when asked what he would say to @entity112 's parents , directed his comments to her mother			2
' if my life would bring her peace and bring @entity192 back , i 'd be fine with that			0
but it wo n't , ' he said			0
' it does n't bring peace or closure			0
she 's still going to have her broken heart			0
