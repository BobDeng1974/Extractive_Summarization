by @entity0 published : 09:49 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 11:56 est , 5 december 2012 a man cleared of child sex abuse has been named in the @entity3 by his mp - who claimed he had ' absolutely no doubt ' that the man is guilty			1
conservative mp @entity7 told the @entity3 that @entity8 , whose sexual abuse case was dropped earlier this year , is ' getting away scot - free '			1
@entity8 , 67 , was due to appear in court in march this year charged with five offences of rape and sexual abuse but his case was dropped by the @entity15 ( @entity15 )			1
the @entity16 mp took the unusual decision to name @entity18 in @entity19 on monday , and said the case was ' one of the worst ' he had ' come across in 20 years of doing this job '			1
named : @entity7 , right , named @entity8 in the @entity3			1
charges against @entity18 for sexual abuse and rape were dropped earlier this year			1
@entity26 told @entity19 that @entity18 was ' getting away scot - free ' and said the @entity15 ' ' handling of the case was a disaster ' he told the @entity30 that prosecutors had failed his victims , taking the decision to drop the case against @entity35 '			1
he said that the @entity15 ' handling of the case ' had been a disaster ' and called for the attorney general to review the case			1
mr @entity7 was protected by parliamentary privilege while speaking in the @entity30 , a legal immunity meaning that he was protected from prosecutions for libel and slander			0
mr @entity7 told @entity19 : ' i have absolutely no doubt that mr @entity8 abused my constituents when they were children , and he is getting away scot - free			1
' @entity19 heard how the charges against @entity18 , of @entity50 , @entity16 , related to allegations of abuse between 1957 and 1961			1
referring to the decision to drop the case , mr @entity7 added : ' this is not @entity57 justice			2
if action can be taken in relation to offences by @entity61 who is dead , if others are in the firing line about incidents relating to 30 or 40 years back , why can a prosecution not take place against mr @entity8 ? ' ' the @entity15 must get their act together			2
every effort must be taken to ensure that justice is done			0
' @entity8 was accused of historical offences against three females			2
the charges included the rape and attempted rape of one girl , the attempted rape of a second youngster and the attempted rape and indecent assault of a third girl			0
a trial date was set for march 26 , 2012 , but on january 10 the case against him was dropped			0
judge @entity84 thew out the case at @entity86 and recorded a ‘ not guilty ’ verdict on all five counts			0
mr @entity7 told @entity19 that the @entity15 only dropped the case after learning that @entity18 's solicitor was ' preparing an abuse of process defence ' , whereby he would say ' that too much time had passed since the abuses had occurred '			1
mr @entity7 told @entity19 how one alleged victim @entity95 - who waived her legal right to anonymity - had contacted police in february 2011			1
privilege : mps can not be prosecuted for libel or slander for anything they say in the @entity19 under a legal immunity known as parliamentary privilege she reported a serious sex offence allegedly carried out against her by @entity18 50 years ago when he was aged between 12 and 16 , mr @entity7 said she spoke out after discovering two others had allegedly been abused and all three went to the police			1
he said the police reassured the alleged victims it was not too late to prosecute as ' there was strong evidence to support the case '			0
mrs @entity117 , @entity16 , was notified by the @entity15 in august 2011 that the prosecution would go ahead			2
mr @entity7 told @entity19 that prosecutors had believed there was a realistic prospect of conviction and believed it was ' more likely than not that mr @entity8 would be convicted '			1
this series of events was followed by the @entity15 decision to drop the case , prompting mr @entity7 to tell the @entity30 : ' so the police believed the victims , and the @entity15 found them to be credible , but the case was stopped over consideration for mr @entity8			1
' mr @entity7 told the @entity30 mrs @entity95 was ' a gentle , reasonable and decent human being '			0
he added : ' i can not think of a single motive she would have to raise this matter after all these years if it were not so that the truth could be told			0
why would she want to put herself through the trauma of a trial if not for justice to be done ? ' ' no reference was made to the victims at all			0
naturally my constituents felt like victims all over again			0
' he accused the @entity15 of acting improperly , telling the @entity30 : ' why did the @entity15 give my constituents hope that the case would go ahead , charge the defendant , thus bringing the matter into the public domain , and then change its mind at the last minute ? ' abuse of process is not a novel concept ; lawyers deal with these types of issues fairly regularly			2
if there was a problem with the evidence , and if the defendant ’s application was likely to be successful , why did the @entity15 not think of that sooner ? ' solicitor general @entity163 said it was not possible to reopen the case , but would raise the matter with the @entity167			2
he said : ' in this case the @entity15 specialist rape prosecutor who was dealing with the case , once he had the benefit of advice from counsel , he considered that a defence application to the court to stop the proceedings would be likely to succeed			0
' so the decision was taken reluctantly by the @entity15 mindful of the distress that it could cause the complainant			0
but it does not follow from the decision that the complainants were or are not believed			0
' put simply the decision was taken because in this particular case the passage of time may have undermined the fairness of the proceedings on the individual facts of the case			0
' following the not guilty verdict earlier this year @entity18 ’s solicitor described the evidence as ‘ weak ’ , the charges ‘ odious ’ and the case ' a shocking waste of taxpayers ’ money '			1
in a statement following mr @entity7 ’s comments , mr @entity8 ’s legal representative said : ' mr @entity8 says that these allegations are false			2
on 9 january 2012 the prosecution offered no evidence in this case and mr @entity8 was acquitted of all charges			2
' whilst we are relieved that the @entity15 took this decision finally , we remain concerned about the matter being pursued that far			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
