when accused murderer @entity1 is released from prison to life on the strict conditional bail conditions imposed by the @entity5 , the 28 - year - old will walk into a much diminished world			1
not only is he banned from his favourite pastimes - drinking alcohol and surfing @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 looking for girls - the bailed defendant can not drive , is banned from carousing on his favourite haunt , the @entity16 nightclub strip , and is not allowed out after dark			1
until three months before ms @entity18 's death , @entity1 had been a regular on the party strip , visiting clubs such as @entity21 , cocktails , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , alive , @entity26 and @entity27 , until managers banned him from at least two of the clubs for being ' creepy with girls '			1

now the accused killer is forbidden from going out after dark or drinking alcohol while out on bail to this : @entity1 is on a strict curfew while on bail and may have few outings other than to attend alcohol rehab and perhaps resume working for his father at @entity69 ( pictured ) from today , the bodybuilder and self - confessed womaniser is only allowed outside his parents house between 6am and 6pm			1

off limits : @entity1 was renting @entity115 in the @entity117 building ( above , left ) when he met @entity18 in the @entity118 and then went back to his flat and she fell			2

prosecutors argued that @entity1 - who could face a 20 year jail term if convicted of murder - was a serious flight risk			0
the $ 200,000 surety put up by his parents to diminish the risk is the equivalent of @entity79 and @entity147 's equity in their @entity34 house , according to bail documents			0
