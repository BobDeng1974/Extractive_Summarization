by @entity0 a pair of @entity3 inventors have created a digital pen that can check for spelling mistakes in handwriting			1
the @entity7 , which is @entity3 for learning pen , has a built - in sensor that recognises writing movements and tracks the shape of the letters to recognise words			1
it then vibrates when a mistake is made			2
@entity15 also has @entity16 built - in and the pen can be connected a smartphone or pc to upload written texts online , share them on social networks or take part in writing training			1
it then vibrates when a mistake is made the computer inside the battery - powered @entity7 is an embedded @entity35 system			1
the board contains a non-optical motion sensor , processor , memory , @entity16 and vibration module , pictured			0
the refill can be replaced and the switch takes the pen from @entity44 to @entity45 future models will also check for grammatical errors and the designers @entity49 and @entity50 hope it will help children and adults develop their writing and spelling skills			1
the idea came from @entity49 's wife while she was helping her son with his homework			0
current digital pens use optical sensors to pick up the writing movements and digitise the words or sketches so they can be used on a computer			2
some of these pens require additional devices , while others only work with specialty paper			0
@entity15 is different because it has the technology and software built - in			1
the computer inside @entity15 is an embedded @entity35 system - a scaled - down version seen on some pcs and laptops			2
the board contains a non-optical motion sensor , processor , memory , @entity16 and vibration module			0
the computer inside @entity15 is an embedded @entity35 system - a scaled - down version seen on some computers			2
the board contains a non-optical motion sensor , processor , memory , @entity16 and vibration module			0
the motion sensor recognises all writing movements , even if the pen is used to write in the air			0
this means @entity15 does n't need any additional recognition devices or special paper to work , like other digital pens on the market			0
built - in @entity16 means it can connect to smartphones and computers for social media sharing or learning websites			1
the pen has two functions - @entity108 to recognise misspellings and @entity45 mode to point out flaws in the form of handwriting and eligibility			2
it uses a built - in handwriting software to compare the written words with the correct spellings			1
future models will also be able to point out grammar mistakes such as wrong word order			1
the refill can be replaced and turns the @entity15 from a ballpoint pen to a fountain pen or pencil			0
early protoypes involved adding the technology to a pencil			0
the motion sensor recognises all writing movements , even if the pen is used to write in the air			0
this means @entity15 does n't need any additional recognition devices or special paper to work			0
it combines a gyroscope with accelerometer , and to optimise the motion recognition , the inventors also added a magnetometer			0
built - in @entity16 means it can connect to smartphones and computers for social media sharing or learning websites			1
the inner workings of the @entity7 pen			1
@entity3 inventors @entity49 and @entity50 hope it will help children and adults develop their writing and spelling skills and plan to make future models capable of recognising grammatical errors the pen has two functions : @entity108 is used to recognise misspellings and will vibrate when a word is spelt incorrectly			1
calligraphy mode is used to point out flaws in the form of handwriting and eligibility , to make it neater			0
@entity15 uses a built - in handwriting software to compare the written words with the correct spellings			1
future models will also be able to point out grammatical mistakes such as wrong word order			1
@entity49 and @entity50 have launched a @entity174 project to raise Â£ 120,000 to produce and sell the @entity7			2
according to the project , the team are using a handwriting engine and language database to trace the words			2
the software has over 40 languages and @entity15 will be launched in @entity181 and @entity3 before being rolled out to more languages			0
this means it could also be used to help people learn new languages			0
the refill of the @entity7 can be replaced to turn it from a ballpoint pen , pictured , to a fountain pen or pencil			2

@entity7 pen has built - in handwriting software that traces written words
if a spelling mistake is made the pen vibrates to alert the user
future models will additionally check for grammatical errors
