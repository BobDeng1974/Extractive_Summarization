meanwhile , @entity7 had what the judge called a ‘ bogus contract ’ relating to a @entity164 club , and pretended he was an agent in a bid to get footballers to contact him			2
@entity9 had also set up a company called @entity168 with an address in @entity110 ’s prestigious @entity170 , for which business cards were printed , but that had never traded and never paid its rent			2
judge @entity174 said : ‘ your only interest was luring footballers in advancing your plan			0

it also sent in an undercover agent posing as the scheme ’s @entity139 investor who handed the businessmen 60,000 euros ( £ 47,000 ) , which they then spent on bribes and placing bets			2
the two men later handed 450 euros ( £ 358 ) to @entity6 , who was then playing for @entity194 - based @entity29			1

unless you are there when money changes hands , or plans are made , that evidence is gone			0
