couples who decide to get healthy together are more likely to be successful , suggests a new study			0
researchers found people are more successful in taking up healthy habits if their partner makes positive changes too			2
scientists at @entity8 ( @entity8 ) looked at how likely people were to quit smoking , start being active , or lose weight in relation to what their partner did			1
among women who smoked , 50 per cent managed to quit if their partner gave up smoking too at the same time , compared with 17 per cent of women whose partners were already non-smokers , and eight per cent of those whose partners were regular smokers			1
the study found that men were equally affected by their partners and were more likely to quit smoking , get active , or lose weight if their partner made the same behaviour change			1
the research looked at 3,722 couples , either married or living together and over the age of 50			2
researchers found people are more successful in taking up healthy habits if their partner makes positive changes too study co-author professor @entity48 , director of @entity50 's @entity49 at @entity8 , said : ' unhealthy lifestyles are a leading cause of death from chronic disease worldwide			1
' the key lifestyle risks are smoking , excess weight , physical inactivity , poor diet , and alcohol consumption			0

' dr @entity65 , lead author of the study at @entity8 , said : ' now is the time to make @entity69 's resolutions to quit smoking , take exercise , or lose weight			1
' and doing it with your partner increases your chances of success			0
' dr @entity78 , @entity50 's head of health information , said : ' making lifestyle changes can make a big difference to our health and cancer risk			0
' and this study shows that when couples make those changes together they are more likely to succeed			0
' getting some support can help people take up good habits			0
for example if you want to lose weight and have a friend or colleague who 's trying to do the same thing you could encourage each other by joining up for a run or a swim at lunchtime or after work			1
' and local support such as stop smoking services are very effective at helping people to quit			2
' keeping healthy by not smoking , maintaining a healthy body weight and being active can all lower the risk of cancer , and the more people can help and encourage each other the better			2
