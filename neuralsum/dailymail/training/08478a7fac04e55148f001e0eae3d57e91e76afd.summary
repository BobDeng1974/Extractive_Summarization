@entity0 was teaching at a local @entity2 university when he came up with a revolutionary new way to teach history that has spread like wildfire through classrooms across the world			1
the ambitious @entity9 and @entity10 history teacher , from @entity11 in @entity12 's north - west , began teaching a non-linear history of humanity , titled the @entity15 , that was soon in such high demand that it took him overseas and won over the curiosity of former @entity21 ceo @entity20			1
' i always had this feeling that in a world with nuclear weapons , and in which many of the problems are global rather than local , we need to not be teaching the history of @entity9 or @entity2 or @entity31 , but the history of humanity - and we seem not to do that , ' mr @entity0 told @entity35			1
' so that pushed me back and back and back until eventually i found myself thinking " i wonder if you could teach a sort of history course that did the whole damn thing "			0
' mr @entity0 proposed the idea to his colleagues at @entity11 and found a number of enthusiastic lecturers who were interested in helping him roll - out the class			2
after years of practice they have developed a coherent course that mr @entity0 describes as teaching ' the history of everything '			2
the course teaches ' the history of humanity ' in a non-linear format by exploring elements of biology , geology and history			1
it discusses the universe , the big bang , the origins of life , how humanity was influenced by religion and agriculture , and even the current climate from the @entity82 , our solar system and the science behind how life developed , right through to how aspects of human life were influenced by religion and agriculture , and then of course the current climate and human consumption – the @entity15 is a lesson on how everything came to be and where it could possibly take us			1
' eventually i realised that this is something that all educational traditions in the past have attempted , ' mr @entity0 said			0
' if you think of the @entity104 tradition or you think of @entity106 traditions – all of them contain origin stories which try to give students a complete sense of how everything fits together and i realised we do n't do that in modern education and i think that 's a real mistake			0
' @entity117 tries to do that – it tries to do what origin stories do but by using the information of modern science			0
' the revolutionary idea soon caught the attention of former @entity21 ceo @entity20			1
mr @entity0 was invited to record a series of 48 half hour lectures on the @entity15 for the @entity127 while he was working at @entity128			2
' i always had this feeling that in a world with nuclear weapons , and in which many of the problems are global rather than local , we need to not be teaching the history of @entity9 or @entity2 or @entity31 , but the history of humanity - and we seem not to do that , ' mr @entity0 said @entity20 , who was working his way through the @entity127 's catalogue , soon reached mr @entity0 's lectures and was instantly won over			1
' i got a phone call when i was at @entity128 from his office and they basically said " mr @entity20 is a great fan of your work , he likes the idea of @entity15 " and they said he 's coming down to @entity150 and he 'd like to talk to you , ' mr @entity0 said			2
@entity20 was won over by the course and spontaneously arranged a meeting with mr @entity0 , saying that he wanted to support the building of a free online website which contained a syllabus of @entity15 for high schools ' what 's the protocol for talking to the richest man in the world ? i had no idea			1
but he was absolutely charming			0
' i was ushered into a room and it was just him and me talking for about two hours and he 's a real enthusiast			0
he was really enthusiastic about this and so it was just an enjoyable conversation			0
' he said he would like to support the building of a free online website which contained a syllabus of @entity15 for high schools , so that 's what we are doing			1
' since their initial meeting , @entity20 has poured over $ 10 million into the @entity15 , the majority of which has been used to build the website , which is free to access by anyone , and all of its components			1
some of the money has also been offered to schools to ' help buy out the teacher 's time ' in order to enable them to learn and prepare for the course			0
' he [ @entity20 ] had some very good ideas about how we should begin the project			2
for example , he argued that it was best to work through individual schools rather than educational bureaucracies – let schools experiment with it so that we can really develop it before we work through the educational bureaucracies , ' mr @entity0 explained			2
in the three and a half years since the project was launched , it has grown from eight pilot classes in the @entity31 and @entity2 into a globally adopted method of teaching			2
the website and all its resources is free to access by anyone online			0
it educates its audience through eight different chapters that include videos , cartoons and a platform for teachers to access resources and share ideas about how to teach the course ' there are about 100 schools in @entity2 which are formally doing it , but i 've been told there could be as many as 500 that are using some of the material informally , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' there are about 300 schools in the @entity31 at the moment but there are also smaller numbers of schools in the @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , about five in @entity237 and one in @entity238 - maybe more			1
' eventually , our hope is that this will go international and i 'd like to see it be translated into other languages			0
' @entity15 has gone global in the last three and half years			0
over 100 schools in @entity2 and 300 in the @entity31 have taken on the course as well as a numbers of schools in the @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 the only difficulties with the course , mr @entity0 said , is the unfamiliarity and the fact that it does n't easily slot into existing school curriculums			1
but after teaching it for 25 years , travelling the world to share his idea and even hosting a @entity257 on @entity15 - as well as making it a priority to receive feedback from schools , teachers and students - mr @entity0 is confident that the course is not only coherent , but enjoyable for both teachers and students			1
' each year we have a lot of feedback from schools and we have revised it , so we are very confident that it actually works in the schools , ' he said			0
' the feedback : most of it has been very good indeed			0
students i think are just very excited to be doing a course that allows them to ask very big questions and to see the connections between different disciplines			0

@entity0 began teaching his experimental @entity15 course at @entity11 in @entity12 's north - west 25 years **ago**
the course teaches ' the history of humanity ' in a non-linear format by exploring elements of biology , geology and history
it discusses the universe , the big bang , the origins of life , how humanity was influenced by religion and agriculture , and even the current climate over eight separate chapters on a free - to access website
former @entity21 ceo @entity20 was won over after watching the lectures and poured $ 10 million *dollars* into the project to launch it in high schools
over 100 schools in @entity2 and 300 in the @entity31 have taken on the course since it was launched three years **ago**
a numbers of schools in the @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 have also begun teaching the course
