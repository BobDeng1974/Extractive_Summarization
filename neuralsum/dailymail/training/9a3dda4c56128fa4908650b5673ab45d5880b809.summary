judge @entity29 said : ‘ it is clear you deliberately deceived the court for your own ends and pleasure			1
‘ your assertion that you were unaware that you could not go away on holiday whilst absent from jury duty due to what you maintain was illness is ludicrous			1
‘ i am satisfied that if you really suffered back pain of such severity that that you could not continue your jury service you would not have been able to endure the travel to @entity4			2
‘ i am driven to the conclusion that you pretended to your doctor that you had a back problem in order that you could take a holiday in @entity4			2

i went to the doctor that night			0
i was signed off for a week			0
i did n’t think i was doing anything wrong			0

judge @entity93 said it had been a serious contempt of court			2

further , it is clear that you deliberately deceived the court for your own ends and pleasure , namely taking a holiday in @entity4			2

various gang members have now been jailed for a total of more than 80 years in all			0

then to come home from holiday and get arrested at the airport , it was terrible			1
i have not heard from her since she was jailed i do n’t know when she will be able to phone me			0
‘ i think what has happened is like using a jack hammer to crack a nut			0
i do n’t know how she will cope behind bars ... i just told her to survive it			0

he was released four days later on appeal			0
detective chief inspector @entity140 , said : ‘ his honour judge @entity29 , the recorder of @entity51 , has sent a clear message that as a member of the public , fulfilling your responsibility on jury service is a fundamental cornerstone of the @entity151 criminal justice system and is to be taken seriously			2
