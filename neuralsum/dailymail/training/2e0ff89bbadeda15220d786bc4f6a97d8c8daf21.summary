research shows learning is much more effective when spread over time than relying on last - minute cramming			1
the developing skills of hundreds of thousands of people were analysed as they learned how to play a simple online game			1
study : academics found that learning over time was more effective ( file picture ) academics concluded it was better to practice for a while and then have a rest compared to continuously playing in the hope of improving			1
in fact , leaving an entire day between sessions strengthened performance , rather than weakened it			1
professor @entity24 , a psychologist from the @entity25 who helped analyse the data , said : ' the study suggests that learning can be improved			1
' you can learn more efficiently or use the same practice time to learn to a higher level			2
' more than 850,000 people were monitored as they played @entity33 , which involves rapid decision - making to click on the correct parts of a screen to grow neurons			2
players were found to improve faster when they left gaps between sessions because it allows the brain to file away information			2
those who played for two hours on two consecutive days generally did better than someone who practised continuously for four hours , for example			0
gap : the results showed that resting for a day improved rather than weakened results ( file picture ) professor @entity24 said the perception that more is learned by cramming is illusory and recommended taking breaks between study sessions			1
the amount of time spent learning is not as important as how well the studying is structured , he explained			1
up to a quarter of students at some leading universities are estimated to have experimented with ' cognitive enhancing drugs ' in the hope of boosting grades			0
a black market in prescription - only medicines such as @entity66 , a stimulant used to treat sleeping disorder narcolepsy , has sprung up			0
medical experts are concerned about the long - term effects , which are not known			0
short - term effects include vomiting , headaches , irrational behaviour , palpitations and poor sleep patterns			0
a separate study last year found 61 per cent of students stayed up late the day before an exam and 40 per cent crammed throughout the night			1
around two - thirds changed their diet before exams in the hope certain foods would help boost their memory			0
this included 53 per cent who started eating oily fish and 46 per cent who had more fruit and vegetables			0
a third even admitted wearing ' good luck underwear ' to improve their exam chances			0
revision expert @entity96 said at the time that students should stick to proper revision			2
' the best way to feel truly confident and help beat that stomach - churning exam angst is to prepare for each exam in advance , making sure you have a dedicated structure for your revision schedule , ' he added .			0
