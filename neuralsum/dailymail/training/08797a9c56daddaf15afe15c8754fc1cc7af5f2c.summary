for astronauts struggling to get up in the morning , it could be a welcome relief			0
researchers say they have perfect a zero gravity espresso cup that can deliver the perfect shot in orbit			1
it uses a series of channels to simulate the pouring needed to create the perfect drink			1
micro-gravity conditions inhibit the production of ' crema , ' the defining feature of a decent espresso shot			2
a shot of espresso is composed of a complex , low - density colloid of emulsified oils			1
the earth 's gravitational pull causes these oils to rise to the surface producing the aromatic foam enjoyed by coffee aficionados across the globe			2
created by the @entity32 and @entity33 at @entity34 , six of the 3d - printed cups are scheduled to fly to the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) in february 2015 aboard a @entity15 rocket			1
' its geometry is the ' smart ' part , which provides the fluids - control system without requiring pumps or centrifugal forces , ' said @entity42 , who developed the system ' the shape of the container can passively drive fluids to desired locations without moving parts — exploiting the passive forces of wetting and surface tension			2
' the new design makes possible the enjoyment of espresso and other drinks in the low - gravity environments of spacecraft			1
it is the second such innovation to be announced by @entity34 , following the zero - gravity coffee cup unveiled last summer			1
without the pull of gravity , fluids behave very differently than on earth			0
instead of ' pouring , ' a liquid retains a more globular shape held together by its own surface tension			2
this phenomenon complicates even the most basic of maneuvers such as drinking a cup of coffee			2
a series of channels simulates pouring needed to create the perfect shot the 3d - printed espresso cup is designed to cheat low - gravity by channeling liquid along a specifically - calculated contour in the vessel to exploit capillary forces that simulate the action of pouring			1

experiments related to the development of the zero - gravity cups have been officially dubbed the @entity99 by @entity100			1
the cup was unveiled at the @entity103 's @entity102 in @entity104			0
' i thoroughly enjoy involving college and high school students in research , ' said @entity109			0
' it 's also enjoyable to see how the low - gravity work supported by @entity100 and performed at @entity34 using the @entity112 has developed -- spawning a company , patenting ip , designing advanced systems for spacecraft , and now hoping to benefit the daily routine of astronauts aboard the @entity13 — with a simple drinking cup of all things			1
' experiments related to the development of the zero - gravity cups have been officially dubbed the @entity99 by @entity100			2
related tests to be performed onboard @entity13 next year include simple drinks such as clear juices , to complex drinks such as cocoa and peach mango smoothies			1
last year one @entity130 astronaut took an @entity132 machine with her to perk up the crew			0
an @entity130 astronaut is bringing an @entity132 machine ( pictured ) with her to the iss. it is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity , where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on @entity142 the @entity143 machine uses a normal @entity145 coffee capsule , which is posted in the top of the machine			1
water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated			0
the granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch , which is securely fastened to the machine using a ' rapid coupling / uncoupling system			1
' astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw			0
@entity161 captain @entity160 is set to be not only be the first @entity130 woman to go into space , but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic espresso in orbit			0
she was blasted to the space research laboratory in november , together with the drinks machine			2
it will be the second long - term mission of the @entity173 ( @entity173 ) aboard the space station			2
coffee company @entity175 worked with engineering firm and space food specialists @entity179 , as well as the , @entity173 to build a coffee machine to bring @entity130 espresso to the @entity13 it is befittingly called @entity132 , and is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity on the @entity13 , where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on @entity142			1
the prototype machine is currently being tested			0
it uses a ' capsule system ' to fill plastic pouches with espresso and other hot drinks such as tea			1
the machine can also be used to rehydrate food			0

the drinks will be made using this specially - designed machine			1
a typical model weighs 29lbs ( 13kg ) , but this model weighs around 44lbs ( 20kg ) in order to handle liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space environment , the plastic tubing inside the normal coffee machines has been replaced with a steel tubes designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar			0
the @entity143 machine uses a standard coffee capsule , which is posted in the top of the machine			2
water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated			0
the granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch , which is securely fastened to the machine using a ' rapid coupling / uncoupling system			1
' astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw			0
the machine is much heavier than a normal model , which typically weighs 29lbs ( 13kg )			0
the space - bound machine weighs around 44lbs ( 20kg ) because there are backups of all the critical components , for safety reasons , and in accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the @entity173 hovering up to 270 miles ( 435 km ) above the @entity142 , the @entity13 ( pictured ) is a long way from home and astronauts have reported missing creature comforts such as coffee and beer ' @entity132 represents a technologically high - value project which , besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts ' menu , will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid dynamics and conditions in microgravity , ' its makers said			1
' @entity130 coffee is a beverage without borders and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into space for some time , ' said @entity175 , vice president of @entity145			0
ten years ago the company produced artwork designed to look like its coffee was in space , and ' today we are in a position to overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso ... on board the @entity13 , ' he continued			1
@entity286 , managing director of @entity179 added that the firm is also taking care of the @entity291 astronauts ' training and nutrition			0
' food provides an important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good @entity130 espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed especially for each astronaut , helping him or her to feel closer to home			0
