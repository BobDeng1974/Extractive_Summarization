by @entity0 published : 12:49 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 06:14 est , 14 september 2012 beloved family pet @entity1 was savaged by two hunting dogs before being tossed into her owners ' wheelie bin when @entity8 and @entity9 received a call on holiday from daughter @entity12 saying their beloved cat @entity1 was missing they raced home early to join the search			1
distraught @entity12 , 18 , had popped round to feed the family 's two identical cats when she noticed blood stains splattered over the drive and realised @entity1 was nowhere to be seen			1
desperate to find the five - year - old tabby , mr @entity8 , 47 , began scouring @entity24 footage captured on three cameras mounted at the front of the house			1
it was then that he discovered his pet 's grisly fate			2
the recording showed @entity1 being brutally savaged by two large dogs - believed to be lurchers - until a man appears to shoo them away			1
the man then picks up the body of their dead pet before callously dumping her into the family 's own wheelie bin			2
mr @entity8 , from @entity43 , @entity44 , said : ' i could n’t believe what i was seeing			0
@entity1 was so close to the front of the house but she stood no chance really up against hunting dogs			1
' but to just toss her in the bin , that ’s the part we can not get over			0
surely this person knew it was a pet cat and somebody would be wondering where she was in the morning			0
' ms @entity9 , 44 , has n’t viewed the footage due to its distressing nature			0
she said : ' we ’d had @entity1 for five and a half years , she was part of the family			1
' the dogs are doing what is natural to them but they should be on leads			2
it ’s just the cold hearted way he put her in the bin and then walked off			0
' i ’d like him to face the music about this , or at least apologise to us			0
chief inspector @entity109 , said : ' it was a horrible incident which is particularly distressing for the pet owners			0
