it is exactly a year since @entity1 revealed that @entity2 was getting the sack at @entity4 , the club deciding to take action as soon as a defeat at @entity7 meant @entity9 qualification was no longer possible			1
into his shoes stepped an entirely different character , the supremely confident @entity12			1
one year on , @entity13 looks at which man has coped best in the crucial areas of the job , with the pressure of trying to continue sir @entity19 's success at @entity20 weighing heavily			1
@entity2 waved goodbye to @entity4 exactly a year ago after a dismal run of results @entity12 has propelled @entity4 back into the top four , despite an up - and - down season results for @entity2 to take a team that had won the @entity26 title by 11 points into seventh place was an unmitigated disaster , even if he coped well with his first @entity9 campaign and reached the quarter - finals			1
@entity4 lost seven of their 19 league games at @entity20 – unacceptable			1
under @entity12 , @entity4 have already won more league points than they did last season and there are still five matches left			1
there has been the occasional blip , like losing twice to @entity40 , but the bigger the match , they better they 've done , which is how @entity4 are meant to be			2
two results stand out in particular			2
under @entity2 , @entity4 lost 3 - 0 at home to their biggest rivals @entity45 and @entity46			1
in the corresponding fixtures this season , they have won 3 - 0 and 4 - 2			2
@entity2 4/10 ; @entity49 7/10 @entity4 reflect on another low point last season after @entity9 defeat against @entity52 there is a different vibe around @entity20 now , as seen in the 4 - 1 win over @entity46 this month performances neither manager plays the same way as @entity19 , whose response when lesser teams came to @entity20 was to try and overwhelm them with attacking play , based on the use of wingers			1
@entity2 is a more cautious manager , prioritising his defence and it left @entity4 fans chanting : ' come on @entity2 , play like @entity19 's boys '			1
@entity49 has also been criticised for building play too slowly , he likes to keep possession as a tool for eventually killing off the opposition , death by a thousand passes			0
but funnily enough that criticism has subsided as the results have improved			0
under @entity2 , @entity4 looked great in some away games , particularly hitting @entity77 for four at @entity78			1
but they fell short in the big matches			0
@entity4 got lucky at @entity80 and @entity81 earlier in the season , but the showing in the @entity85 derby a fortnight ago was a lot more vibrant			1
@entity2 5/10 ; @entity49 6/10 @entity87 scored twice as @entity4 enjoyed a 4 - 0 win at @entity77 , a rare good show under @entity2 @entity90 's double helped @entity4 scrape a lucky win at @entity81 in december decisions @entity2 got himself into a pickle before he 'd even started by appearing ambiguous over whether he was a @entity90 man or a @entity95 man			1
the result was the pair failed to link up in any meaningful way			0
having spent £ 27million on @entity99 , he deployed him too deep , and failed to get the best out of experienced players @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			0
@entity49 comes across as a man who knows what he wants but a defensive injury crisis early on seemed to make him lurch from one formation to another			0
@entity95 was also shunted around from attack to midfield which did n't get the best out of him			0
ironically , it was @entity49 's decision to push a @entity2 signing , @entity99 , forward which proved the key to turning @entity4 's season around			1
@entity2 and @entity49 have both made mistakes but the @entity120 seems to have the strength of personality to correct them in time			2
he has left big names out like @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity90			0
@entity2 did n't seem to have the confidence to do that			2
making @entity95 captain was a @entity49 plan that has worked			0
@entity2 5/10 ; @entity49 6/10 @entity105 ( left ) was one of the senior pros whom @entity2 failed to get the best out of @entity126 has been a big disappointment under @entity49 , but the @entity4 boss has n't been afraid to drop him @entity136 it 's a confusing area because we do n't really know who has been responsible for all the signings at @entity4 since @entity19 left			1
one can assume @entity2 handpicked @entity99 from @entity7 and he has been a belated success , but the £ 37.1million acquisition of @entity87 looked more like opportunism from @entity145 who needed at the time to know he could pull off a big deal			2
@entity147 , signed when @entity49 was in charge , is regarded more as a @entity2 buy - he 'd done the homework on the @entity150			2
likewise , @entity49 can take credit for @entity152 , whose versatility has come in useful this season , and @entity155			0
he admits he had little to do with @entity147 or @entity156 , and the capture of @entity126 was probably driven at boardroom level			0
the biggest signing , £ 60million for @entity160 , is interesting			0
@entity49 definitely liked him as a winger but the @entity162 has been a letdown despite 10 @entity26 assists			0
@entity2 definitely scores a higher mark now for his transfer business than he would have scored when he left the club , which is why his supporters are aggrieved he was n't given a second season			1
@entity2 6/10 ; @entity49 5/10 @entity99 was originally branded a poor signing but @entity2 's decision has since been vindicated @entity125 was bought for a @entity173 record £ 60m , but has flopped in his first season at @entity4 relationship with players having worked with @entity95 as a teenager at @entity7 , @entity2 was able to get the striker back onside despite his disappointment at the time of not earning a move to @entity182			1
but other senior professionals did not react well to the @entity184			0
@entity90 felt he was over-trained , though he was careful not to publicly criticise @entity2 , but others like @entity103 were not shy about voicing complaints over issues like when the team was announced			2
@entity105 made it clear he preferred a more direct , attacking approach with ' pace and width '			0
club captain @entity102 made his decision to leave during @entity2 ' tenure			1
it is hard to know exactly what goes on in the inner sanctum but it does appear @entity49 is highly respected by his @entity4 squad			2
the attention to detail in training has won over key players like @entity95 and @entity204 , the midfielder even suggesting the team 's new style has been taken on board by the players quicker than the fans have done			2
even when the team was struggling , you have n't heard mumblings of discontent in the dressing - room compared to a year ago			0
@entity2 5/10 ; @entity49 7/10 @entity2 endured a fractious relationship with several stars at @entity4 , including @entity218 @entity95 and @entity49 have formed a strong bond , and the @entity120 has the respect of his squad public relations in a sense , @entity2 was handed a thankless task , replacing @entity19 as the ' @entity225 '			1
it did require a strong personality with a thick skin , and unfortunately the @entity184 failed on both counts			0
in retrospect , he was too deferential , when he cited the club 's tradition for bringing in young players and attacking until the end , it did n't sound right because his strengths lie elsewhere			1
his admission that he did n't take @entity218 off because he feared the reaction smelt of weakness			0
neither was he helped by criticism from club legends @entity243 and @entity244 on television			0
because of his c.v. , @entity49 has been able to lay down his markers rather better			0
he has dealt with the likes of @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 and the fans of @entity52 and @entity253 so nothing at @entity4 was going to frighten him			2
he has been confident enough to lay down his philosophy , whether popular or unpopular			0
his biggest error was getting sucked into an argument over long - ball tactics with @entity259			0
@entity2 5/10 ; @entity49 7/10 a banner critical of manager @entity2 was flown above @entity20 during a match against @entity262 @entity49 's glittering cv ensured he had the gravitas needed to take on one of the game 's biggest jobs escaping the shadow of fergie having personally anointed @entity2 , @entity19 maybe felt subconsciously he should have some influence			1
he went to nearly all the matches despite having said on retirement he 'd travel the world and was put out that @entity2 let his backroom team of @entity275 and @entity276 leave			1
certainly , when @entity2 was heading out , @entity19 knew about it and did n't fight to keep him			1
@entity19 knows he wo n't hold any sway over @entity49 and does n't even try , which has helped the @entity120			2
he rarely goes to games now , and when he does he 's definitely regarded as a legendary former manager rather than a backseat driver			0
whether he intended to or not , @entity19 's shadow loomed large over @entity284			1
it 's an issue @entity49 has not had to contend with apart from the fans chanting ' attack , attack , attack ' when the ball is passed back to @entity290			0
@entity2 4/10 ; @entity49 6/10 total : @entity2 34/70 ; @entity49 44/70 sir @entity19 was a regular presence in the stands at @entity20 during @entity2 's rule @entity19 , pictured speaking with @entity49 in 1998 , knows he does not hold influence over the @entity120			1

@entity4 confirmed @entity2 's sacking on april 22 , 2014
but @entity1 revealed @entity2 's job was gone the *day* before
the club were in *turmoil* following sir @entity19 's retirement
