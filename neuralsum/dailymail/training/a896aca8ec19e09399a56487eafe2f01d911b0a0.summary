president @entity0 lashed out tuesday at @entity2 lawmakers during a @entity4 speech seemingly designed to shift public debate away from his @entity7 - and @entity8 - related political train wrecks and toward safer territory : jobs and the economy			1
speaking to a crowd estimated at between 1,800 to 2,000 people – primarily staff of the @entity17 film studio , according to a @entity19 pool reporter – the president slammed @entity2 partisans while claiming economic moral high ground that poll numbers suggest he 's incapable of holding			1
' instead of rooting for failure or re-fighting old battles , @entity2 in @entity24 need to work with us , ' he declared , complaining about his opponents ' fixation on the @entity7			0
' we would be a lot further along without some of this dysfunction and obstruction we 've seen in @entity34 , ' he insisted ,			2
' if we did n't [ sic ] have one wing of one party that was a little less obsessed with repealing health care for 40 million people			1
' @entity0 's speech at @entity17 may be a payback for ceo @entity43 's massive fundraising haul on the president 's behalf bffs : @entity43 ( @entity46 ) raised at least $ 15 million for @entity0 's 2012 re-election campaign , placing him in the president 's inner circle and winning his company a coveted visit he claimed that the nation would have created more jobs through infrastructure projects and other initiatives if @entity2 ' had n't spent more than 40 votes trying to repeal the @entity7			1
' more than 6 in 10 @entity58 workers told pollsters in a recent @entity61 survey , co-led by a @entity63 agency , that they fear they will lose their jobs , the highest such number measured since the 1970s			0
and 32 per cent said they worry ' a lot ' about becoming suddenly unemployed			0
the @entity17 crowd was safe political territory , a company led by major @entity71 donors and situated in @entity4 's liberal enclave			2
@entity0 played to the crowd , saying as he departed that ' i ca n't wait to see your next movie ! ' and praising the @entity58 entertainment industry for providing the world 's best ' place to make movies and television and music			1
' nationally , though , he 's having trouble re-establishing his credibility after the disastrous launch of his signature health insurance overhaul , and persuading @entity58 that he 's up to the job of rescuing the country 's faltering economy			2
a @entity92 / @entity91 poll released monday showed that 53 per cent of @entity58 believe the president is not honest and trustworthy			0
and only 40 percent say he can manage the government effectively			0
six months ago , @entity0 maintained his high voter ratings on such personal attributes even as his job - performance began to tank			0
teleprompters are commonplace in @entity4 , and put @entity0 in his element as he soaked in the sun and delivered his outdoor speech on tuesday virtual motion : @entity0 and @entity43 took in a demonstration of motion - capture technology used in the upcoming film , ' @entity107 , ' during the president 's tour the movie studios in @entity111 , @entity112 so instead of touting his own bona fides , he took a page from his campaign playbook and attacked his opposition			1
republicans , he said , had done ' nothing to create jobs , or grow the economy , or strengthen the middle class			0
' @entity0 blamed @entity2 for stonewalling his policies , and took credit for economic developments , like rising domestic oil production , that have come about despite his policies casting himself as the nation 's public - opinion barometer , he declared that ' the @entity58 people agree with us ' – meaning @entity71 – ' that jobs and growing the economy should be our top priority			1
' ' for instance , he claimed that ' for the first time in nearly 20 years , @entity58 now produces more of our own oil than we buy from other countries			0
' but the @entity140 says @entity58 's boom in domestic oil output is due mostly to hydraulic fracturing – fracking – a controversial technique used to get oil from shale deposits			1
that method has drawn ire from @entity71 in @entity24 and among the president 's nonprofit environmental cheerleaders			2
it 's @entity2 , especially those from states like @entity155 and @entity156 , who have pushed the fracking revolution forward			0
and @entity0 claimed that ' thanks in part to the @entity7 , health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years			1
' that finding came from a report prepared by the president 's own @entity165 , an office within the @entity19			2
the group said last week that health care spending grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent rate per capita since 2010 , the lowest rate on record for any three - year period			2
but overall , health care expenses in the @entity58 amount to 17.7 per cent of @entity177 , by far the highest such measure in the developed world			2
and by every measure , consumers are on average facing higher insurance costs as the @entity7 reaches full implementation			0
@entity0 has failed to endorse or embrace fracking , as a hat - tip to green campaigners			0
but the technology is responsible for the @entity58 oil boom he touted on @entity188 wild and crazy guys : actor @entity191 ( @entity46 ) met @entity0 , mugged for cameras and elbow - bumped the president before his speech in @entity112 @entity195 , an economist at @entity196 who helped craft the @entity7 law , warned @entity198 that ' i think the health economists are still saying , " wait and see " ... what will happen in the long term			1
' @entity0 insisted tuesday in @entity4 that he 's not letting up as his health insurance plan approaches a series of key deadlines			1
' yes , we are going to continue to implement the health care law			0
people want it , ' he claimed			0
' thousands of @entity112 are signing up , ' @entity0 added			0
and in a wry acknowledgment of the technical glitches that have made @entity7 a laughingstock , the president insisted , ' by the way , the website is continually working better			1
' presiding over the @entity220 was @entity17 studio chief @entity43 , one of @entity0 's most stalwart and consistent fundraisers			1
he raised $ 15 million for the president 's 2012 re-election campaign during just one expensive , star - studded dinner last year			1
' @entity19 deputy press secretary @entity226 , however , downplayed the coincidence			0
' mr. @entity43 's support for the president 's policies has no bearing on our decision to visit there , ' he told reporters tuesday on @entity236 .			2

' we would be a lot further along without some of this dysfunction and obstruction , ' the president insisted
*slapped* at *conservative* lawmakers , wishing for ' one wing of one party that was a little less obsessed with repealing health care '
@entity4 speech was at @entity17 , whose ceo @entity43 raised $ 15 million for @entity0 during his 2012 re-election fight
@entity0 touted the @entity58 oil boom as an economic *success* story despite its roots in ' fracking ' – a technology his administration has tried to block
president 's speech came during massive 7 - fundraiser *swing* through @entity265 - *friendly* @entity112
could n't resist touting @entity7 : ' by the way , the website is continually working better . so check it out . '
