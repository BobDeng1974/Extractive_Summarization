condemned @entity2 pair 's ongoing battle to spare their lives has moved to @entity6 's constitutional court , a challenge that has been labelled as a delay tactic			1
@entity9 and @entity10 lost a bid to challenge their clemency rejections in the state administrative court , which upheld its earlier decision that presidential decrees were outside its jurisdiction on monday as @entity20 waits on the legal efforts of a few other prisoners before setting an execution date , the two @entity19 's lawyers sought a constitutional court review to make clear the president 's obligations on considering clemency on thursday - a process that could take several months			1
@entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) are now appealing to @entity6 's constitutional court attorney - general @entity30 has declared the move by the pair 's lawyers as a delay tactic they also intend to challenge the barrier preventing foreign citizens from constitutional court appeals			1
however , attorney - general @entity30 has dismissed the challenge as delaying tactics and says he wo n't recognise it			1
@entity6 lawyer for the death row pair , @entity44 , told reporters the effort was not aimed at delaying the executions , but clarifying a prisoner 's rights			2
the president 's obligations when assessing a prisoner 's life were unclear , she argued , such as the weight that should be given to rehabilitation			0
' this judicial review wo n't delay the executions but we will tell the government please hold on until this process is done , because if the constitutional court accepts what we lodge , the documents , maybe there will be a new mechanism to consider their clemency , ' she said			2
the pair 's lawyers also intend to challenge the barrier preventing foreign citizens from constitutional court appeals @entity10 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) are now imprisoned on @entity73 's nusakambangan island where they face the prospect of death by firing squad the lawyers ' argument is that president @entity79 breached his responsibilities to treat the applications for mercy on their merits , instead rejecting them because he wishes to deny clemency to all death row drug offenders			1
mr @entity30 says the pair have already had their appeals and any constitutional court decision would only apply to future cases anyway - not that of the condemned duo			0
meanwhile , his spokesman @entity92 said an execution date that avoids the @entity94 was still being considered , when @entity6 plays host to various heads of state from april 18 - 24			0
mr @entity92 said although it was legal - it would not be ethical to carry out the executions while hosting the international event but they would continue to look for a ' good day ' during this month for the prisoners to face death row			0
the @entity105 men are now imprisoned on @entity73 's nusakambangan island where they face the prospect of death by firing squad			0
two of the other eight prisoners in line for execution with the @entity19 have applied for @entity113 judicial reviews , while another is also pursuing an administrative court case .			0
