by @entity0 and @entity1 the first of four ' blood moon ' eclipses lived up to expectations , proving an eerie sight across @entity6 overnight as the moon was illuminated a deep red			1
the four - stage event , known as a ' @entity10 ' , is also believed to mark the the beginning of significant events - even the the @entity11 - in some religions			2
the awe - inspiring spectacle occurs when the @entity16 's shadow passes over the moon - and it will happen three more times over the next two years as part of this cycle			1
the next @entity10 cycle wo n't occur until 2032			2
some @entity31 are concerned that the celestial event could mark the start of terrible events , based on a passage from the @entity36 that says : ' the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the @entity41 comes			1
' although lunar eclipses happen multiple times in a year during a full moon , this eclipse is a particularly fortunate viewing opportunity for @entity47			0
blood moon rising : the opening stages of one of the world 's rarest astrological events set alight : as the @entity55 eclipse continued , it appeared as though the moon was being illuminated from within captivating : stargazers the world over were transfixed by the rare event since the @entity16 's @entity61 is facing the moon during the eclipse , the continent was in prime position to view it from start to finish			1
the eclipse also coincided with night time in @entity47			0
the entire continent wo n't be able to witness a full lunar eclipse in its entirety again until 2019			0
' sometimes they 'll happen and you 'll have to be somewhere else on @entity16 to see them , ' @entity71 , @entity72 deputy project scientist at @entity74 's @entity73 , said before the event			2
beautiful : the moment was most visible across @entity6 , like here above the @entity82 in @entity83 fireball : the lunar eclipse was most visible in @entity6 , like @entity86 ( left ) and @entity87 ( right ) a bad omen ? some @entity31 were concerned that the strange celestial event ( pictured ) could mark the start of terrible events and drew on a passage from the @entity36 that says : ' the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the @entity41 comes ' phases : although lunar eclipses happen multiple times in a year during a full moon , this eclipse is a particularly unusual viewing opportunity for @entity47			1
this composite image shows the transition during the total lunar eclipse from the bottom left - hand corner to the top left a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of @entity16			2
this is an area known as the umbra , where light from the sun is blocked by our planet			0
the light refracts differently in the atmosphere and , as it hits the moon , it appears red			2
this gives rise to its ‘ blood red ’ appearance during a total eclipse , when the entire moon is in shadow			2
if it skirts the shadow , known as a partial or penumbral eclipse , the effect is less dramatic			0
when the moon first enters the @entity16 's partial shadow , know as the penumbra , a dark shadow begins to creep across the moon			1
this gives the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks			0
at the eclipse 's peak , the moon enters the @entity16 's full shadow ; the umbra			1
at this stage , the @entity16 's atmosphere scatters the sun 's red visible light ; the same process that turns the sky red at sunset			1
as a result , the red light reflects off the moon 's surface , casting a reddish rust hue over it			1
it 's not often that we get a chance to see our planet 's shadow , but a lunar eclipse gives us a fleeting glimpse			0
during these rare events , the full moon rapidly darkens and then glows red			2
at the eclipse 's peak the moon entered the @entity16 's full shadow , the umbra			1
at this stage , the @entity16 's atmosphere scattered the sun 's red visible light - the same process that turns the sky red at sunset			1
as a result , the red light reflected off the moon 's surface , casting a reddish rust hue over it			1
' it 's a projection of all the @entity16 's sunsets and sunrises onto the moon , ' mr @entity71 said			1
the moon is seen as it nears a total lunar eclipse in @entity188 , @entity189			0
people across @entity6 ad @entity6 were able to witness the first of four in a rare @entity10 of eclipses over the next two years an airliner crosses the moon 's path above @entity197 , @entity189 approximately one hour before the total lunar eclipse , which some people believe signifies the beginning of a number of significant religious event other - worldly : the incredible view from the @entity205 @entity204 of @entity206 illuminating : the moon glows orange , as seen from @entity208 in the @entity209 ' it 's a very subtle effect , and if any part of the moon is illuminated in the sun , you ca n't really see it			1
' ' they do n't happen all the time , and the sky has to be clear			0
it really gives you a chance to look at the moon changing			0
' however , some believe the eclipse has larger significance			0
@entity224 , a @entity225 pastor who has written a book on the @entity10 called ' @entity227 : something is about to @entity229 ' told the @entity230 that last night marked the dawn of a ' hugely significant event ' for the world			1
' this is not something that some religious think tank has put together , ' the notoriously outspoken church founder said			0
' @entity74 has confirmed that the @entity10 has only happened three times in more than 500 years — and that it 's going to happen now			0
' taking in the view : astronomers in @entity6 are thought to be viewing the blood moon from 2.06 est ( 7.06 gmt ) to around 4.24 est ( 9.24 gmt )			2
here , people watch the ' blood moon ' rising over the water in @entity245 , @entity246 no show : the total eclipse is visible over most of @entity47 , but not in most of @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 , as explained by this map @entity74 has confirmed the @entity10 started on tuesday night and will end on september 28 , 2015			1
tetrads are a relatively frequent occurrence in the 21st century , with nine sets in total , but this has not always been the case			0
from 1600 to 1900 , for example , there were none at all			0
the @entity262 in the @entity36 prophesied about the blood moons and the @entity11 : ' the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the @entity41 comes			1
' according to mr @entity224 , each time the @entity10 has happened during that time , there has been a significant religious event accompanied with it			0
the unusual alignment of the sun , @entity16 and @entity270 happened a week before the beginning of the astrological event that some believe is associated with the @entity11 in 1493 , the first @entity10 saw the expulsion of @entity277 by the @entity278			1
the second happened in 1949 , right after the @entity279 was founded and the most recent one - in 1967 - happened during the @entity280 between @entity281 and @entity279			0
mr @entity224 said the first of the blood moons takes place right in the middle of the @entity277 holiday of @entity287			2
the second , on october 8 , occurs during the @entity288 and the third will be on april 4 , 2015 , also during @entity287			0
the final one happens on september 28 , 2015 , which is also during the @entity292 .			0

last night marked first of four blood moons , followed by six full moons
it 's an extremely rare astrological event known as a @entity10
the striking red moon was most visible across @entity6
looks red because the @entity16 's atmosphere scatters the sun 's red light
it 's the same process that makes the sky appear red at sunset
the @entity10 cycle finishes at the end of september in 2015
some @entity31 believe the @entity10 is a signal the end of the world is near
