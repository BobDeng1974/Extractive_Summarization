a woman was left horrified after she spotted a giant rat outside her home in north @entity3			1
@entity4 photographed the rodent , which she estimated to be between 16 and 18 inches , as it peered through her back door in fashionable @entity7			1
the sighting comes as pest controllers revealed the shocking epidemic of mutant rats - some as big as cats - across the @entity13			1
the rodents , which have been seen been seen across the country over the past year , are twice as large as normal species and can not be killed with traditional substances			1
@entity30 , of the @entity31 , said rat numbers were going up by about 15 per cent each year - and the boom was driven by the availability of food			2
' the more food , the more rodents it will attract , ' he said			2
@entity39 , director of @entity40 , said : ' we see big rats in cold stores			2
the rats grow a very thick fur			2
that can make them look bigger			0
' you might see a rat under a pallet that looks as big as a cat			0
' similar stories of giant rats have been reported by pest controllers in @entity55 , the @entity57 borders and @entity28			1
last week , experts warned of a plague of super rats after it was revealed that pest control budgets have been slashed by a quarter by local authorities			1
information released to @entity65 by councils has revealed deep cuts in the amounts being spent on controlling vermin			0
a map details where notable rats have been recorded across the @entity13 since 2010			1
the rat discovered in @entity28 this month was giant at 20 - inches , but not considered ' mutant ' as it was killed traditionally across 200 local authorities in @entity77 , pest control budgets have been cut by 24.4 per cent on average since 2010			1
there has also been a 16 per cent cut in the amounts spent on street cleaning			0
some authorities insist they have taken steps to provide better value for money , accounting for reductions in budgets			0
but others admit they have stopped providing pest control services altogether			0
@entity92 rats are typically larger than sewer rats and can not be killed by traditional rodenticides			1
the species has developed a genetic mutation which means substances approved by the @entity98 to control rat populations has no effect on them			0
pest controllers are calling for new rules to be made allowing the creation of stronger poisons , though the health and safety risk to humans and the environment this bears is a bone of contention			1
most rats are found in food premises , though some have been recorded across the @entity13 in homes			1
to prevent the creatures from infesting your home or business , experts advise keeping conditions spotlessly clean			0
ensuring wheelie bins have proper drain holes is also important , said exterminators			0
' a rat in the wrong place is a problem for anybody so you have to be vigilant whether its commercial or residential			0
' they 'll chew water pipes , electric cables and it puts your property at risk , ' said @entity136 of exterminators , @entity138			0
traditionally , people have been able to call out pest control officers from their local authorities if their homes are infested with mice , rats , wasps or other pests			1
many councils have offered free assessments , and then made subsidised charges for proofing , poisons or other recommended measures			0
the decline in local authority services means more people are likely to attempt ineffective and sometimes dangerous diy solutions , increasing the numbers of pests , experts said			0
reports this year suggest that rats in the @entity13 are becoming bigger , and some are developing resistance to traditional methods of control			1
so - called ' super rats ' are expected to outnumber humans two to one by next year			0
genetic testing by @entity169 has revealed that some rodents have developed a mutation that allows them to survive conventional poisons			2
in counties including @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity29 , @entity179 and @entity180 , all the rats tested were found to have immunity to poison			2
earlier this year , worried homeowners shared photographs of the rodents , some of which were as large as small cats			2
one , found on an industrial estate in @entity190 , measured two feet , while another in @entity191 , @entity180 , was the width of a shovel			0
researchers at @entity169 performed studies on the rodents , with some parts of @entity13 more severely affected than others			1
in @entity200 and @entity201 , around 20 per cent of rats tested were immune to traditional poisons , while a third in @entity203 could not be killed using the substances			2
in @entity206 , 75 per cent of the rodents were found to have the genetic mutation			0
spread : this enormous rat discovered in @entity209 last year measured 50cm			0
reports this year suggest that rats in the @entity13 are becoming bigger , and some are developing resistance to traditional methods of control epidemic : this rat found in @entity28 is the largest on record for the @entity29 town			1
pest exterminators have warned an influx of super rats may be on its way , with the rodents immune to traditional poisons			1
