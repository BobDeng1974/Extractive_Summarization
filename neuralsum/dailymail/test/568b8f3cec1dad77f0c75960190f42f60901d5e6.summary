a football club chairman has warned of a new breed of hooliganism in the sport â€“ from retired grandfathers who are trying to relive their youth and encourage violence on match days			1
@entity8 , the boss of @entity10 outfit @entity9 , believes groups of up to 10 men - aged in their 50s and 60s - are trying to relive the 1980s by arranging fights with rivals prior to games			1
he said violence at matches has increased recently as the older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their ' gangs '			1
' our promotion to the @entity48 appears to have encouraged our " risk " from the 1980s to come out of retirement			2
' many of them are grandparents trying to encourage the next generation to join their " gangs "			2
' it sounds pathetic but unfortunately it is reality			2
we are working closely with police			0
' hopefully the reality of the potential consequences will dissuade some of our younger supporters from becoming involved with these undesirables			0
' our football club is too important to so many to allow a few to ruin our great sport			2
' @entity64 , a @entity9 fan , said he had noticed that the hooliganism of the 1970s and 1980s still lingers in games against local rivals such as @entity68 and @entity69			1
he said : ' there 's a tension and you feel threatened so i do n't go to those places anymore			0
it 's not worth it			0
' most places are fine though , but you still tend to go to away games and keep your colours hidden			0
' i remember the 1970s and 1980s and it was horrendous and of course it 's nothing like that but it 's still a problem			0
' these people must have something missing in their lives to want to do this			0
' @entity9 supporter @entity92 , 42 ( pictured with wife @entity93 ) , remains in a medically - induced coma since being attacked after an away game to @entity68 on march 21			1
police said he was an ' entirely innocent victim ' mr @entity8 said older men were those causing violence			1

he said : ' they arrive after the game starts and then leave before it finishes to find a fight			0
' @entity9 supporter @entity92 , 42 , remains in a medically - induced coma since being attacked after their game away to @entity68 on march 21			1
@entity125 said he was an ' entirely innocent victim ' and believe he was set upon by a group of thugs intent on attacking the visiting @entity9 fans			1
@entity129 said the force has also seen an increase in the ' severity and volume ' of football - related disorder this season			0
inspector @entity136 said : ' we have seen an increase in football - related violence and disorder amongst a very small minority of people , both in @entity109 and other locations when the club has travelled			2
' the tragic events recently leading to a serious injury in @entity68 have been reported widely and sicken us all			0
mr @entity8 said @entity9 had noticed an increase in violence since the club was promoted to @entity10 last year			1
pictured : @entity68 's @entity151 beats @entity152 to the ball in last month 's match ' the club is working hard with us to ensure that those who use football as a vehicle for violence and disorder have no place in the terraces or association with @entity9			1
' he said police are using football banning orders , which impose ' stringent court - backed ' restrictions on individuals			0
he added : ' the increase of risk activity both in severity and volume this season means regular consideration of this level of intervention is once again - and sadly - justified and necessary			0
' the warning comes as football chiefs across the country continue to promote the @entity183 campaign to promote respect within football .			2
