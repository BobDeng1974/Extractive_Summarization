by @entity0 the @entity1 and @entity2 were branded ‘ irresponsible ’ last night over a £ 260 child car seat fitted in @entity5 ’s official car just hours before his hugely anticipated first royal tour was due to begin			1
the @entity9 safety seat was installed in the ‘ royal limo ’ for the future king by @entity12 , a national charity which provides services and support to parents and young children			1
at @entity2 and @entity20 ’s specific request , a technician from the society installed the seat facing outwards			0
but @entity12 , which is a hugely influential group locally , is very vocal about its own guidelines which recommend children remain in rear - facing car seats until the age of two			1
@entity44 facing seats , it says , significantly reduce the risk of death or injury , protecting the baby ’s head , neck and spine even as a toddler			2
despite its public stance it proudly issued photographs of its car seat services technician @entity57 fitting @entity5 ’s offending restrainer and saying : ‘ if it ca n’t be installed correctly we need to work out a way we can make it correct			1
we need to make sure the baby is safe			0
’ response to the photograph was immediate with hundreds of parents going online to complain about double standards			0
@entity67 said on the @entity69 page : ‘ they [ @entity20 and @entity2 ] have made an irresponsible decision about facing their baby forwards in the car			2
‘ @entity75 added : ‘ you went against everything you recommended , undoing all your hard work regarding rear facing until two			0
’ last night , however , the society was unapologetic			0
chief executive @entity81 said @entity12 ’s role was ‘ to provide advice and work in partnership with parents ’ to make informed decisions that worked best for them			2
' the charity proudly shared this image of a @entity12 employee fitting the chair , despite anger over the direction although the young royal , pictured a day old , is legally old enough to face forwards in the @entity33 , the firm 's guidelines state a child must be two years old before graduating from rear - facing safety chairs until now , the eight - month - old royal has faced backwards on car journeys , and is now old enough to face ahead he added : ‘ ’ @entity12 ’s priority is to ensure car seats are installed by qualified car seat technicians to ensure they perform correctly			1
while @entity12 recommend that children stay in rear - facing seats until age two , it is not a legal requirement			2
’ @entity12 spokesman @entity112 said he had spoken to @entity113 , and stressed that the seat was installed ‘ in line with the parents ’ preferences ’			2
the row is particularly embarrassing as the organisation has organised a meet and greet with other babies of a similar age for @entity5 , who will be accompanied by his parents , at @entity124 in @entity125 on wednesday			1
in another potentially awkward moment , a leading @entity30 politician also warned yesterday it was ‘ inevitable ’ the country would become a republic			0
former deputy prime minister sir @entity131 , who was also secretary general of the @entity132 for eight years , said the country had been moving to renounce the @entity133 ‘ for a long time ’			1
‘ there are 54 countries in the @entity132 , only 16 are realms [ where the @entity137 is head of state ] , and i can tell you now that one @entity140 publicly , and three @entity140 privately , are probably going to give up the relationship with the monarchy when the @entity137 dies			0
so it is a diminishing group of countries and the important thing is for us to openly and candidly debate the issue , ’ he said			0
asked when @entity30 might go down the same road , sir @entity131 added : ‘ i do n’t know when ...			0
[ but ] i think it is inevitable			0
the family have come under fire for overriding the charity 's minimum age limit of two years for outward - facing safety seats just hours ahead of touching down in @entity156 for their tour of @entity159 or @entity30 the couple 's private secretary said the tour has been designed with @entity5 's comfort in mind ‘ i ’m quite certain the royal family understands that completely			1
’ @entity20 , @entity2 and their son , @entity5 , were last night on a flight heading @entity27 to begin a landmark three week tour of both @entity30 and @entity159 , another country where the republican cause is strong			1
the @entity173 understands that they were travelling @entity174 , along with @entity5 ’s new @entity176 nanny , @entity177 , 43 , and a fulsome security detail , on a @entity180 flight via @entity181			1
tickets cost around £ 6,300 return			0
the plane is due to land in @entity156 early on monday morning , allowing the royal party to transfer to a @entity30 @entity187 jet which will transport them for the first leg of their tour			2
the bill for all flights associated with the tour is being met by local taxayers			0
although the three week trip , undertaken on behalf of the @entity137 , has been more than a year in the planning , it has very much been designed with baby @entity5 in mind , according to aides			1
and instead of hawking themselves from city to city , as is customary on overseas royal visits , @entity20 and @entity2 will base their young son in three different ‘ hubs ’ : @entity125 , @entity156 and @entity208			2
the family and nanny are currently on board a @entity180 flight flying first class to @entity156 via @entity181 the arrangement means his doting parents will be able to travel back to see @entity5 almost every night - bar a stop - over in @entity216 , @entity30 , and another at @entity217 in @entity159			1
‘ it ’s a long way to go and [ would mean ] a long time away from their son , ’ the couple ’s private secretary , @entity218 , said earlier this month			0
‘ the tour has been designed with @entity5 ’s consideration and comfort in mind			1
‘ taking a nine month old on a royal tour is not a first , but it has not happened in this @entity133 ’s context for many , many years so there has been much to think about - as any new parent travelling long distance will recognise			1
’ royal aides have warned that @entity5 ’s scheduled public appearances are open to change given his young age and the fact that no - one knows how he will cope with the long journey and 11 - hour time difference			2
sources have told the @entity173 that the little prince is also teething - as well as starting to crawl - which will only add to the unpredictability			0
but he is , generally , a happy little boy say friends of the couple , who is adept to taking everything in his stride - including , hopefully , the large crowds waiting for their first glimpse of the future king .			0
