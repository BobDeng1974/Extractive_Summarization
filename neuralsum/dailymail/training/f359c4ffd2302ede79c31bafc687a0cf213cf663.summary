@entity1 boss @entity0 will not shirk the challenge as he searches for the winning formula			1
pressure is growing on @entity5 , at a club not renowned for its patience , as the @entity1 ’ poor run of results continued with a 3 - 1 loss to @entity11 on @entity12			1
@entity1 have won just one of their last eight @entity15 games and are only two points above the relegation zone ahead of a tricky trip to @entity19 on sunday			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 will not shirk the challenge as he searches for the winning formula @entity0 watched on in the snow as his side lost 3 - 1 to @entity11 on @entity12 but @entity5 has reasons to be encouraged			1
his side built up a 2 - 0 with some impressive attacking play against @entity25 last weekend - only to capitulate and lose - and individual errors hampered them against @entity11			2
@entity0 said : ' it will be a very tough game at @entity19 - it is a hard place to go			1
they are a team who are capable of causing you a lot of problems			0
' but we will do the work we normally do on them and hopefully that will get us a good result			0
' they had a good result against @entity40 and will be feeling good about that , so it is a big challenge - but if we can eradicate the individual errors then when are good enough to cause them problems			2
' all i can do is keep trying to do the job in the way i that i do it			0
i try to leave nothing to chance			0
' @entity0 could certainly do little as goalkeeper @entity50 spilled a deflected @entity52 cross to allow @entity53 to give @entity11 an eighth - minute lead at @entity55 on friday			1
five minutes later former @entity11 defender @entity56 then felled @entity57 for a penalty converted by @entity59			0
@entity57 put the result beyond doubt with a well - taken third after @entity56 gave the ball away on 34 minutes , but @entity1 showed spirit amid a second - half blizzard to create a number of chances			2
@entity11 midfielder @entity53 netted an acrobatic opener after eight minutes against @entity1 @entity59 then converted a penalty to make it 2 - 0 after @entity57 had been fouled just five minutes later @entity57 slotted in a third from inside the area just after half an hour they finally claimed a deserved consolation three minutes from time when @entity77 goalkeeper @entity76 missed a corner in the snow storm and the ball ricocheted into the net			1
the final touch came off the back of @entity85 ’s head , giving the @entity87 striker a fortuitous - but much - welcomed - first @entity15 goal			2
@entity0 said : ' i challenged them to be strong mentally , to have that toughness and that courage to take the ball and not crumble			0
' it is easy to say that and challenge them but they have got to go out and do that and , to be fair , they did			0
' midfielder @entity100 could return for @entity1 at @entity19 after illness and a calf strain but striker @entity103 remains on the sidelines			1
captain @entity105 could come back into the starting line - up after making his comeback from a hamstring injury off the bench .			0

@entity0 will not shirk challenge of finding winning formula at @entity1
*baggies* have won just one of their last eight @entity15 games
they were beaten 3 - 1 by @entity11 at home on @entity12
