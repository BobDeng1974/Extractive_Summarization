by @entity0 and @entity1 follow @ @ kie1410 @entity3 fans may feel their club is being stripped and sold for parts , but it is n't all doom and gloom as they find themselves top of the pre-season table			1
it 's always debatable as to how much pre-season matters , but @entity3 supporters will take any positives they can after the sales of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and co. and @entity3 chairman @entity19 has tried to calm the nerves at @entity21 's by insisting ' every penny ' of the sold stars will be made available to @entity24			1
scroll to the bottom for @entity27 's pre-season table which @entity3 currently top on the move : @entity29 sealed his £ 20million switch to @entity31 from @entity3 at the weekend warrior : @entity17 became the most expensive defender in @entity31 's history with the switch sold : @entity36 ( left ) and @entity16 ( @entity37 ) signed for @entity31 for £ 4m and £ 23m respectively beaming : @entity15 completed his £ 31.5m move to @entity39 from @entity3 players in @entity41 ( @entity42 ) £ 8m @entity43 ( @entity44 ) £ 10.3m total funds out so far : 18.3m @entity46 @entity15 ( @entity39 ) £ 31.5m @entity17 ( @entity31 ) £ 20m @entity36 ( @entity31 ) £ 4m @entity16 ( @entity31 ) £ 23m @entity47 ( @entity48 ) £ 12m @entity50 ( @entity49 ) free @entity52 ( @entity51 ) free total funds in so far : £ 90.5m @entity54 is likely to follow his former team - mates to the @entity21 's exit after trying to push his transfer to @entity58 through with an outburst on @entity60 , although @entity61 insists otherwise			1
the @entity3 chief adds - amid unease from fans over the selling spree - that the £ 90.5m raked in will be spent on the club			2
' @entity24 wants to build something here at @entity3 , ' @entity61 told @entity68			2
' our summer activity is definitely not a fire sale , every penny of that will be up for reinvestment as transfer fees and wages			1
' it is there right now as we speak for @entity24 and ( club executive director ) @entity79 to put into play in the transfer market			0
' we need to have a dressing room filled with players who want to be at @entity3 , who understand the way we ’re moving forward , how we ’re building towards @entity86 football and how we can get there in a healthy way			0
' elsewhere , @entity90 are going about their pre-season business as expected , the champions having picked up maximum points from four games			0
@entity94 , however , find themselves at the opposite end , with a dire points - per - game average of 0.3			0
@entity99 join them in the bottom two with no wins from four matches - hardly the entertainment demanded of manager @entity104 by the @entity99 board			0
optimistic ? @entity3 manager @entity24 will have the funds brought in made available to him on his way ? @entity54 looks likely to follow his former team - mates to the @entity21 's exit wanting out : @entity54 is looking for the exit at @entity21 's for a move to @entity58			2

@entity15 , @entity16 , @entity113 were sold by @entity3 but @entity3 won all four pre-season games ahead of @entity116 start
@entity3 chief @entity19 insists @entity54 and @entity118 will not be part of the selling spree during the summer
@entity19 : ' our summer activity is definitely not a fire sale , every penny of that will be up for reinvestment as transfer fees and wages '
@entity54 and @entity118 are n't for sale , insists @entity19
