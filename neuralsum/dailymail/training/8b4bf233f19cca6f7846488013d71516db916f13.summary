for @entity2 visitors , it is one of @entity5 's more common tourist traps - the struggle to pronounce place names such as @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
now a new @entity12 invention hopes to help those struggling by offering audio examples of names of commonly mispronounced sites , based purely on recordings of they are spoken locally			1
the newly - patented technology by the web giant could be implanted into @entity20 , saving future tourists the embarrassment of tripping over the name of @entity5 's commonly mis - stated landmarks			2
if it comes to fruition , multiple recordings of how locals say a particular word would be submitted and uploaded to a server			2
from there , @entity12 would assess the recordings to attach the word 's most common pronunciation to the place name on @entity20			1
this function could be handy , as @entity12 says in the patent , ' when traveling in a foreign country			1
' ' systems and methods are provided to select a most typical pronunciation of a location name on a map from a plurality of user pronunciations , ' the application says			0
' a server generates a reference speech model based on user pronunciations , compares the user pronunciations with the speech model and selects a pronunciation based on comparison			0
' ' alternatively , the server compares the distance between one the user pronunciations and every other user pronunciations and selects a pronunciation based on comparison			0
@entity12 could determine the most common pronunciation of a place name from audio clips submitted by locals			1
this could then be used to find the most common pronunciation			0
software could then find the most common recorded file , and play it to users when someone searches for the place on @entity20			0
' the server then annotates the map with the selected pronunciation and provides the audio output of the location name to a user device upon a user 's request			0
' the place name used in the patent filing is @entity9 - the name of a city in the @entity5 , and also of one in @entity88 and ten places in the @entity2 â€” and it is pronounced slightly differently in each country			1
@entity12 said the patent does n't necessarily mean that @entity12 will be adding this functionality to its maps anytime soon : ' some of those ideas later mature into real products or services , some do n't , ' a spokeswoman said			1
@entity12 also recently officially launched speech translation as part of its translate app. both @entity102 and @entity104 users can now talk to the app and get a written translation of what they 're saying , in real time , on the screen			2
the move builds on @entity12 's current tools , which offer written translation of 90 languages , as well spoken translations in a select number of languages on @entity104 devices			2
@entity12 could determine the most common pronunciation of a place name from audio clips submitted by locals			1
this could then be used to find the most common pronunciation ' often the hardest part of travelling is navigating the local language , ' said @entity128 , product lead for @entity130			0
' now @entity130 can be your guide in new ways			0
asking for directions to the @entity134 , ordering bacalhau in @entity136 , or chatting with your grandmother in her native @entity138 just got a lot faster			0
