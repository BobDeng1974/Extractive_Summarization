at least 40,000 @entity1 couples signed up for the intimate challenge of 30 nights of @entity4 throughout the month of september			1
the couples were set intimate daily tasks and given a @entity4 box of goodies before they began their quest with the end result aiming to bring them closer together in their everyday hectic lives			1
relationship expert and coach @entity12 says there are endless things that you can do to get in the mood			1
' think of it like a toolbox – lots of different activities and its a different one every single evening , ' she said			2
' you can use those to help the two of you connect and have a lovely and intimate time together			1
' the idea came for the challenge came about after @entity26 ’s annual @entity28 survey revealed that almost three in four @entity1 couples want more emotional and physical interaction from their partner and 70 per cent are unhappy with the amount of sex in their relationship			1
@entity36 player @entity35 and his wife @entity37 have shared their 30 day journey and how they coped with juggling looking after their two children and finding the time to spend on themselves			1
' we implemented things like embracing each other a bit more throughout the day , ' she said			2
' we tried to take technology out and it mean you 're not just picking up calls and it ’s the simple things but sometimes they are the most effective things			2
' ' we are addressing everyday as it come and just looking at it quite openly - it 's nice to be abel to experiment and work out what works for us and then move forward with that			1
' @entity35 spent five minutes tidying up the lounge room once the children went to bed to help get them in the mood ' it was good to just put everything front of mind - stepping outside yourself , ' he said			2
' we all can be a little bit self - consumed sometimes so it makes you feel good when you are thinking about others and doing stuff for others than just for yourself			2
' ms @entity12 said kissing is one of the most intimate things a couple can do – it 's also one of the most effective ways of getting in the mood and staying connected @entity35 said he hoped the tasks became easier and more natural as the weeks went on			1
' you think after so many years will be easy but when you are forced to do it you think " why is this so difficult ? "			2
' the couple found the first week was quite challenging to find the time for each other week 2 : touch @entity35 said this week was more difficult than the first seven days which involved communication and that probably your biggest thing in a relationship ' @entity37 is probably more affectionate than i am – she enjoys the hug and the touch – whereas i can take or leave it a little bit more , ' he said			1
' giving her a massage is comfortable and easy although the other stuff is different but it 's good to know what each other 's likes are			2
' @entity37 said agreed that it was helpful to discuss what each other enjoys to have done to them			0
' that ’s something that sometimes you would n't necessarily chat about as a couple so it 's good raising these little awarenesses to these points that you can then get something out of it , ' she said			0
' now we are into week two we have been able to roll into it a bit easier			0
' @entity35 ( left ) admits that the second week was tough @entity130 ( right ) was more affectionate than he was week 3 : explore the couple were hesitant about a couple of the this week 's exploration tasks including using a camera in the bedroom			1
' i felt this week with using a lot of props – it was ok but it did n’t feel natural – i 'm a pretty easy going guy - i do n’t really need too much to please me , ' @entity35 said			0
' as you get further into the program – it 's more in depth and taking you out your comfort zone			0
' @entity37 said her husband was working on becoming more affectionate in the program			0
' it 's something that he is following through with and being really mindful of - he gives me glimpses of back at the start how he used to be with our relationship , ' she said			1
' we referred back to a couple of other days we enjoyed in the week and we tried to implement those things again			0
' the third week involved exploration tasks which took the couple out of their comfort zone week 4 : @entity164 this week focused on different ways to make love and keep the creativity flowing			1
the task on day 26 of waking the neighbours was a daunting prospect for them			0
' our house is pretty noisy as it is , ' @entity35 joked			0
' but i 'm looking forward towards the end when we have special nights where you focus on each other			1
' ' a lot of times we have had a good giggle , ' @entity37 said			0
at the end of the four weeks , the couple felt more connected and really in sync with each other			0
' its been fantastic - we ’ve been able to take on the challenges more confidently – we are very much on similar pages in terms of the things we like to do in our personal time , ' @entity37 said			0
' its amazing when you focus on something the better you become at it – we have both improved and grown , ' @entity35 said			0
@entity35 even found value out of the more cringeful tasks			1
' the things that do stand out are the ones where you think " nah these are n’t us " , ' he said			0
' with role playing – we looked at it and said " nah it 's not for us " although the good things are the things that work - you also learn from your mistakes so to speak			0
' ' it 's something we have really enjoyed - the journey has been fun and the results of it has strengthened our relationship and really get back to what it used to be like - i think it ’s a great concept , ' he said			1
at the end of the four weeks , the couple felt more connected and really in sync with each other			0
