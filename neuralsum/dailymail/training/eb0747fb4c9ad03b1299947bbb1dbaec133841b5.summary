by @entity0 it is a matter @entity2 and @entity3 have clearly discussed at some length in private			1
but their decision to make public their thoughts on assisted suicide and reveal details of a suicide pact they have made has led to one of television ’s most popular couples dividing opinion and exposing themselves to criticism			1
after 26 years of marriage , the former presenters of @entity20 ’s @entity19 said they had made a ‘ pledge ’ to help one another if they were suffering and considered it the ‘ responsibility ’ of their partner , regardless of the consequences			1
under fire : @entity2 and @entity3 , pictured in @entity28 , @entity29 , on monday , were yesterday accused by anti-euthanasia campaigners of ' promoting ' suicide mr @entity2 , 57 , said he would not hesitate if his wife asked him to give her ‘ a little push to go over the edge ’ and miss @entity3 said she would do the same			1
under @entity37 law , a partner can be prosecuted if they help someone to die			0
mr @entity2 said he would spare his wife such a fate by joking that he would shoot himself in the head			1
‘ for me , it would be the locked room , the bottle of whisky and the revolver , ’ he said			2
‘ i would n’t want to mess around			0
’ devoted : the couple , who have been married for 26 years and have two children together , said on sunday that they had made a suicide pact if one of them would become seriously ill miss @entity3 , 65 , was equally forthright			1
we ’ve made ourselves give each other a pledge along those lines , ’ she said			2
however , they were accused by anti-euthanasia campaigners of ‘ promoting ’ suicide , with their celebrity status increasing the risk of copycat agreements			1
dr @entity64 of @entity65 said mr @entity2 ’s revolver comment amounted to a breach of @entity69 guidelines about the discussion of suicide in the public sphere			1
the guidelines , which are intended to protect the vulnerable , state that celebrity endorsement is to be avoided and methods should not be discussed			0
disability rights campaigner @entity77 , who is against the legalisation of assisted suicide , echoed those concerns			0
while noting that the couple ’s decision was ‘ entirely their own matter ’ , she added : ‘ when it becomes problematic is because they have a very prominent influence on people			1
still going strong : the couple , pictured in 1993 , have been married for 26 years ‘ they have a massive following but what they ’re not doing is thinking about how their decisions may impact upon other people and the adverse effect this could have on people			2
‘ they have a very influential voice and the people who will suffer will be those who are vulnerable to influence and coercion			0
' while everyone has a right to an opinion , i do n’t think what they ’ve done is responsible			0
’ however , @entity111 , which supports assisted suicide , welcomed the debate ignited by the couple			1
‘ this is a conversation that needs to be had and any discussion about it going on in the public sphere is a positive thing , ’ said a spokesman			2
the couple have two children together – @entity122 and @entity123 – and @entity124 has two sons from a previous marriage			0
they were last on tv screens regularly five years ago but remain well - known due to their book club , which is now in its tenth year			0
the couple , who became grandparents 18 months ago , revealed that they decided to confront the issue when mr @entity2 ’s mother died last month			1
he said that although she had @entity136 ’s and lung cancer , her death came as a shock			0
miss @entity3 added : ‘ it ’s just the shock of death			2
it is so final … i suspect that the closer you get to your own mortality , the more final it seems			0
’ assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in @entity146 and @entity147 , technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison			2
guidelines issued in 2010 indicated that anyone acting with compassion on the will of a dying person is unlikely to face charges			0
severely ill @entity37 are increasingly ending their lives by travelling to clinics abroad , such as @entity157 in @entity158 .			0
