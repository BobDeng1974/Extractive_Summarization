by @entity0 @entity2 head coach @entity1 is refusing to give up on summer targets @entity4 and @entity5 despite a frustrating wait to secure them			1
the @entity2 appeared to receive a double set - back in their pursuit of the pair earlier this week when @entity4 's agent @entity11 indicated that the player 's preference was to fight for his place at @entity15 , while a report from @entity17 suggested @entity19 full - back @entity5 was no longer for sale			1
however , @entity1 remains optimistic that deals can still be struck for the two men who provided sterling service during loan spells at the @entity25 last season			1
determined : @entity1 says he wo n't give up on trying to bring @entity4 and @entity5 to @entity2 staying put : @entity4 ( left ) would prefer to stay at @entity15 and fight for his first - team place asked about 23 - year - old @entity4 , the @entity29 told the @entity30 : ' it is not for me to explain but it is not just a question of @entity4 wanting to come or not			1
there are many , many things to look at and unfortunately , i can not comment on those			2
' we are involved in negotiations and you never know how long that can take			0
there 's nothing new to report as things stand , but we are still hoping to close the deal completely			0
' it 's up to @entity4			2
we have been clear , everything is fine , there 's no doubt about his connection with our club , and me and him get along fine , so there is no reason for it not to happen			0
' i would love to know how long it will take to sort out , but all i can tell you is that things are changing every day			0
' we have targets that we are looking for , we have other options , but we have an agreement with @entity15 and we will do everything possible to get @entity4 to the club first			1
' if @entity4 does not come , it does not set us back , we would move on - we are not a one - player team			2
' the capture of 23 - year - old @entity5 too is a priority , and one which @entity1 is confident can be achieved			2
he said : ' it 's close , but not close enough			0
' we 're trying hard			0
it 's been a bit more difficult than i expected , but we 're not going to stop			0
' lasting impression : @entity5 ( left ) enjoyed an impressive season on loan at @entity2 in the last campaign			1
