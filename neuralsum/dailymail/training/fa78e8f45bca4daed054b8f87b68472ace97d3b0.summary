by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity2 was dragged into a fresh hypocrisy row today after it emerged it has been printing @entity6 election leaflets - in @entity7			1
@entity9 's party has campaigned to protect @entity11 jobs , slash immigration and pull out of the @entity13			1
but instead of using a @entity11 firm to help the party 's campaign it took ' full advantage of the @entity20 single market ' to place its order abroad			1
@entity2 leader @entity9 , unveiling the party 's @entity6 billboard in the run - up to the elections , has faced accusations of hypocrisy after his party used a @entity7 company to print its campaign leaflets mr @entity9 , pulling a pint of ' @entity32 ' during a visit to the @entity34 - east last month , has faced increasing levels of scrutiny following his party 's rise to the top of the polls ahead of next week 's @entity20 elections the revelation comes after it emerged the party had hired @entity44 to hand out its anti-immigration flyers ahead of next week 's @entity20 elections			1
latvians were employed by a company called @entity48 in @entity49 , south @entity50 , to hand out flyers for mr @entity9 's party			1
at the time , @entity54 mp @entity53 said : ' @entity2 ’s hypocrisy knows no bounds			1
' he added : ' they say they are against @entity20 taking our jobs and then , when they have a chance to offer some @entity11 people work delivering their leaflets because they ca n’t find volunteers to do it , they employ @entity20 workers			1
' it also comes after it emerged that one of the stars of a @entity2 poster campaign , who appeared to be a @entity11 builder ‘ hit hard by unlimited cheap labour ’ , was actually an @entity76 actor , @entity75			2
mr @entity9 has also faced personal accusations of double - standards after employing his @entity7 wife as his secretary - claiming no @entity80 would want to work for him			1
the @entity2 leader said ordinary @entity80 would not want to put in the same hours as his partner , @entity83 , who is paid £ 25,000 as his secretary by the @entity85			1
he was challenged over the appointment after he launched a £ 1.5million poster campaign for the @entity20 elections that warned 26 million unemployed @entity20 were ' after ' @entity11 jobs , driving down wages and leaving @entity11 workers begging on the streets			2
asked whether there is no @entity11 person able to do the job , mr @entity9 said : ' no , because i do n't think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight , going through emails , getting me briefed for the next day			2
' nobody else could do that job			0
i do n't know anybody who would work those kinds of hours			0
' he added : ' that is a very different situation to the mass of hundreds of thousands of people coming in and flooding the lower ends of the labour market			0
' @entity2 claimed its poster campaign was a ' hard - hitting reflection of reality ' - but it later emerged that it had used an @entity76 actor to represent a @entity11 builder put out of work because of immigration @entity2 's rise in the polls has sparked an increasing number of protests against the party			1
@entity9 's regional organiser in @entity124 , @entity125 ( centre ) , was forced to tell supporters in @entity128 last month that the party leader would not be turning up because of security issues @entity2 has insisted its latest gaffe , using a foreign firm to print its flyers , was a mistake - blaming the internet for making it hard to know where products are made			1
the leaflets were distributed in west @entity50 to support @entity141 , the @entity2 council candidate for @entity142 in west @entity50			1
they were printed by @entity144 , a @entity20 firm that employs 400 in @entity11 and have an office in @entity147			2
but according to trade magazine @entity151 , all of the company ’s printing takes place in @entity7			2
@entity2 's @entity9 was yesterday roundly attacked for stoking fears that @entity11 would be swamped by @entity154 and @entity155			1
figures showed that the number of migrants arriving in the @entity11 from the two countries actually fell in the first three months of the year a @entity161 source it was ' good to see @entity2 taking full advantage of the @entity20 single market '			1
but @entity2 's @entity164 , who placed the order for the leaflets , said : ' i was n’t aware of it when we ordered the printing			1
i saw the @entity147 address and thought “ fantastic we ’re supporting a local business ”			0
‘ i only found out the company was @entity7 when i phoned to chase delivery and asked whether i could pick the leaflets up , and was told they were on a plane from @entity7			1
‘ i was a bit disappointed			0
this is the problem with the internet , you do n’t necessarily know where things are coming from			0
’ he added : ‘ we try and support local businesses and in future we want to use local printers			0
we will be getting a cv off them first			0
’ the @entity189 has also used @entity144 for materials that have been delivered to households in @entity192 , promoting its candidate @entity193			0
a spokesman said : ' the @entity189 uses a range of firms and most of our print is done in the @entity11			0
' mr @entity9 has called for an @entity201 - style points - based system that would only allow skilled people with no criminal records into the country , cutting immigration to 30,000 - 50,000 people a year			2
that could see higher numbers of @entity209 and @entity210 coming to @entity11 but fewer eastern @entity20 , he said			2
@entity211 , the mp for @entity212 , said @entity2 's plans to curb immigration would leave @entity11 resembling @entity215 , which shut itself off from the rest of the world during the communist era			2
@entity219 suggested he would not block a referendum in the event of a future coalition deputy prime minister @entity219 today hinted he would not stand in the way of @entity225 's plans for an in / out referendum on @entity11 's membership of the @entity13 in a new coalition after the next general election			2
the @entity161 leader said there would be more important issues for him - such as " fairer " taxes - in any coalition negotiations in the event of another hung parliament			1
his comments come after mr @entity225 said he would not lead another government after the election next year unless there was a commitment to a referendum before the end of 2017			0
while mr @entity219 said he stood by his position that there should not be a referendum unless there was a fresh transfer of powers to @entity249 , he indicated that it was not a " die - in - the - ditch " issue for him			0
' i am going to disappoint you by not now drawing great red lines , " he told the @entity254 4 today programme			0
' are there die - in - the - ditch issues which i have highlighted in the past which i care about , frankly , even more than this ? yes			0
i think fairer taxes is something i 've campaigned for			0
' that is something i care about much more than the precise mechanics of when a referendum is held			0
' mr @entity219 said that past history suggested there would be changes to the @entity13 treaties which would require a referendum in the @entity11 under legislation passed by the coalition			2
' i have always felt that you have a referendum when the time is right , when something happens which merits that referendum , " he said			0
' if you look back at the development of the @entity285 , and subsequently the @entity13 , every few years the rules of the game - these cumbersome treaties - are changed and new decision - making authority is pooled at @entity20 level			1
' so i think , if history is any guide , it 's more than likely to happen again			0
at that point there should be a referendum , we 've guaranteed that in law			0

@entity9 dragged into fresh hypocrisy row over @entity13 flyers gaffe
comes after @entity300 were used to hand out anti-immigration leaflets
@entity2 leader was also *criticised* for employing @entity7 wife as secretary
@entity161 say they are happy to see party using @entity20 single market
