by @entity0 and @entity1 the surgeon who carried out @entity4 ’s first hand transplant last night praised the donor ’s family for bringing about good from the ‘ awful tragedy of a loved one ’			2
professor @entity8 , who led the complex eight - hour procedure at @entity10 , said their permission had to be sought soon after their relative ’s sudden death on @entity16			1
there is no tick box for ‘ limbs ’ on donor register forms so next - of - kin must be consulted ‘ individually by the hospital ’			1
i would like to acknowledge the extraordinary gift			2
‘ organ donation of any kind plucks something positive from that awful tragedy of a loss of a loved one			2
’ it is not known what tragedy befell the donor but sources say it was most likely to have been a car crash or a stroke			2
professor @entity48 spoke as the recipient , @entity25 , continued to recover in hospital and revealed that his next milestone is to be able to hold his three - year - old grandson ’s hand for the first time			1
immediate success : mr @entity25 , pictured with @entity26 and surgeon @entity8 , said he wonders who his new hand came from but will never know for data protection reasons the 51 - year - old former pub landlord , who lost the use of his right hand five years ago , said the implications of his surgery were still sinking in			1
as he continued to marvel at being able to wiggle the fingers of his new hand , he said he hoped to regain his independence and enjoy family life to the full			1
speaking of his grandson @entity68 , he said : ‘ anything i can do will be a bonus			2
holding his hand is going to be great			2
’ mr @entity25 , from @entity73 , @entity74 , lost the use of his right hand – and some from his left – when it became infected during a severe attack of gout , a condition he had suffered for 20 years			1
‘ i had to go into hospital to cut the infection out and it left me with a paralysed hand , ’ he said			1
he and his wife @entity26 , 47 , had to leave their beloved village pub , the @entity88 near @entity89 , and he has been unable to work since			2
‘ it made it virtually impossible to do anything , ’ he said			2
‘ my wife had to help me dress and cut my food up			2
you can imagine without any hands it ’s very difficult			0
’ a friend told yesterday how so far , for all of @entity68 ’s life , mr @entity25 has had to settle for ‘ just observing ’ the little boy , rather than be able to play with him			1
‘ he ’s the apple of his eye , ’ the friend added			0
@entity105 : consultant plastic surgeon and professor of hand surgery , @entity8 , began investigating the possibility of carrying out the @entity4 's first hand transplant ten years ago mr @entity25 ’s operation nine days ago became a world first when his original hand was removed in the same procedure			1
while there have been 70 hand transplants world - wide , in those cases recipients had already lost the limb before the surgery			1
yesterday professor @entity48 said it could be 18 months before the operation is considered a success			1
‘ if all goes well , i would hope he has quite strong grasp , and have good sensibility , a good ability to feel , and he ’ll have a precision pinch , ’ he said			0
mr @entity25 , who has had psychological help to enable him to accept the new hand as his own , continues to be kept in isolation at hospital to reduce risk of infection			1
‘ the feelings are starting to come back and everything ’s looking very good , ’ he said			0
‘ it feels like my hand			0
’ by @entity139 after celebrating @entity140 with his family , @entity25 was all set for a holiday with his wife in @entity144			1
but shortly after 8pm on @entity16 he received the phone call telling him he was to undergo a hand transplant			1
by 1pm the next day he was preparing for the eight - hour landmark surgery at @entity10			1
new lease of life : @entity25 , pictured before the operation with wife @entity26 and grandson @entity68 in 2011 , hopes that the days of a useless hand are over and that he can return to employment mr @entity25 had been unable to use his right hand for five years after it became infected owing to severe gout , an acute form of arthritis caused by a build - up of uric acid in the blood			1
he and his second wife @entity26 , who celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary last year , were forced to give up their beloved village pub , the @entity166 in @entity73 , near @entity89 , because of his disability			0
mr @entity25 , a former rugby league player , was also left wheelchair - bound at one point when the gout affected his spine			1
he said : ‘ anything i have now is better than what i had before this operation			0
i ’m hoping to eventually get back to work – i ’m already moving my fingers and the doctors say i ’m making quicker progress than they expected			1
’ photographs posted by mr @entity25 on his @entity179 page show his swollen hand before the operation and a painful infection on one of his fingers			1
mr @entity25 said he was shocked when he was offered the ground - breaking surgery less than three months after he was added to the transplant register			1
‘ after a lot of tests , professor @entity48 ( the plastic surgeon who performed the operation ) told me i could be a candidate for a hand transplant , and asked me to give it some thought			0
before the operation : @entity25 suffered from gout and his hand was left paralysed after becoming infected ‘ i discussed it with my family and came back to professor @entity48 in about october and told him i wanted to go ahead with it – so when i got the call on @entity16 to say there was a donor i was gobsmacked			1
‘ i really expected quite a wait , and it was a bit of a gulp moment			0
@entity26 and i were meant to be going on holiday to @entity144 this week , but this is obviously a much better turn - out			1
’ when doctors learned that a hand suitable for transplant had become available they called in mr @entity25 for tests to check how his tissue matched with that of the donor			1
he said : ‘ i was called into the hospital along with another recipient , and they tested us to see which was the stronger match – and i was			0
’ within hours the doctors began the gruelling surgery , which saw his hand removed and the replacement attached in the same operation			1
brand new hand : the eight - hour surgery involved attaching his arm to the new hand using titanium plates mr @entity25 added : ‘ it did n’t feel real until i woke up after the operation			1
it felt like a dream , even when i was going into theatre			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s how i expected it to look , because i ’ve done a lot of research about hand transplants			0
but you can do all the research you want and you do n’t know how you ’re going to feel – i ’ve had a lot of help from psychologists because the biggest thing is afterwards , whether i would accept it as mine			0
’ mr @entity25 , who has one daughter , @entity242 , is full of gratitude to the family of the donor			1
his wife added : ‘ it was a wonderful thing to do			0
it must have been really difficult for them but i ’ll always be grateful for the choice they made			0
’ professor @entity252 , president of the @entity253 , said : ' this is yet another example of life - changing surgical advancements that are now possible			2
' new surgical techniques together with a greater understanding of organ rejection are making an ever wider range of transplants possible			0
this presents opportunities for treating conditions and improving quality of life in ways that simply were not possible in the past			0
' as with all procedures that improve the quality of life rather than save it , there is an ethical balance to be struck – especially as the lifelong anti-rejection medication that the patient would need to take carries its own risks			0
' @entity274 always needs to be taken in choosing suitable patients who understand the risks and benefits			0
this selection should be by a multi-disciplinary team of doctors which includes a psychologist or psychiatrist as a core - member of the selection team			2
' hand transplants have already been carried out by doctors in the @entity287 , @entity288 and @entity289 leading the way for other transplant operations of such organs as the face , abdominal wall or larynx			0
the first major organ to be transplanted successfully was a cornea , by @entity298 in @entity299 , @entity300 in 1905 , but not until nearly 50 years later , in 1954 , did doctors in @entity302 successfully transplant a kidney			0
the first successful heart transplant was by dr @entity305 in @entity306 , @entity307 , in 1967 , and was followed by the first heart and liver transplants in the @entity4 the following year			0
not until 1983 did @entity4 see the first combined heart and lung transplant			0
in 2005 , the first partial face transplant was carried out , in @entity313 , @entity289 where @entity314 , a 38 - year - old woman who had been mauled by her dog , was given a new nose , chin and lips			2
five years later the first full face transplant was carried out , in @entity320 , @entity321 , on a farmer known only as @entity323 who had been injured in a shooting accident			0
he received the entire facial skin and muscles - including cheekbones , nose , lips and teeth - of a donor			2
in october 2006 , surgeon @entity333 at @entity335 's @entity334 was given permission by the @entity338 ethics board to carry out a face transplant			0
his team will select four adult patients for operations .			0

@entity25 , 51 , suffered gout and developed infection , causing paralysis
