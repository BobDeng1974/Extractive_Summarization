an enraged father has made an emotional @entity2 video calling out two high schoolers after they made racial slurs about his adopted @entity6 daughter			1
@entity7 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , struggled to contain his tears as he recalled how his eighth - grade daughter , whom he and his wife adopted 11 years ago , was targeted by bullies			2
and in a shocking twist , when mr @entity7 confronted the father of the bullies , the man responded by calling the concerned dad a ' n * * * * * lover ' in messages left on his phone			1
the father , @entity21 , 49 , has now been fired from his job			1
heartbroken : @entity7 recorded a six - minute video recalling how his @entity6 daughter was called a ' n * * * * * ' by classmates - and when he confronted their father , the man repeated the slur in shock : he showed the video of the twin boys calling his daughter a ' sl * * ' and a ' n * * * * * ' on @entity35 in the six - minute video posted to @entity2 on monday , @entity7 recalled the incident			1
' we have a very beautiful @entity6 daughter that we were very fortunate enough to adopt 11 years ago , ' he said			0
' we 've dealt with a little bit of racism , you know , stares , things like that when she calls us mom or dad , but she did n't notice so we just blew it off because it was directed towards us			0
' but on @entity51 , his daughter and one of her friends were hanging out at his home and sending @entity35 messages to friends			2
a set of twins from her school , who @entity7 says do not like his daughter , then started sending her racist , bullying messages on the app , he said			1
loved : he said he would never want his daughter to ' end up committing suicide because of morons ' after @entity35 messages play , they disappear , but when the twins sent their fourth abusive message to the girl , her friend went and told her parents who filmed it on their phone			1
mr @entity7 played it to the camera			0
it shows the twins making faces at the camera and calling the girl a ' sl * * ' , a ' n * * * * * ' and a ' fat a * * b * * * * '			1
the horrified parents found out who the twins were and contacted their parents and even went to their home , but received no answer , he said			0
' i love my daughter and i do n't want her to end up committing suicide because of freaking morons , ' @entity7 said			2
' i ca n't have this hanging over us and my daughter thinking the worst			0
' so he contacted police , who went to the school and spoke with the children and their parents			2
mr @entity7 then contacted @entity21 - but received a less than sympathetic response			1
' he did n't understand what was wrong with the video , ' he recalled			0
' he told me i was crazy , that that 's what he did when he was a kid			0
him and his family make jokes at the house using this word all the time so what was the big deal ? ' @entity21 then left voicemail messages on mr @entity7 's phone , which @entity7 played to camera			1
' i guess you 're a n * * * * * lover , ' he said on one			1
' that 's a correct statement because i am an n * * * * * lover because i have a beautiful @entity6 daughter who i love more than life itself and would do anything for her , ' @entity7 responded			1
fired : @entity21 , pictured with his sons , said he stood by his racist comments and did not care if mr @entity7 shared his messages online			1
since mr @entity7 shared his name in the video , he has been fired from his job @entity21 then sent another : ' @entity134 , you 're a f * * , grow up ... you 're a loser			1
' when @entity7 told @entity21 he was going to share the messages on social media , @entity21 said he stood by his remarks - and that he did n't even care if he gave out his name			2
but @entity21 was probably not expecting the response from viewers of the video , which has been watched more than 300,000 on @entity2			2
on wednesday , it emerged that @entity21 's employer , financial firm @entity142 , where he worked as an independent contractor , let him go , @entity141 reported			0
' @entity21 is no longer associated with @entity146 as of today january 21st , ' they wrote in a statement on their website			0
