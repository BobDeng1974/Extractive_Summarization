as @entity1 draws near , @entity0 are back on familiar territory			1
a @entity4 title race that was only expected to feature two contenders suddenly has a third team loitering with intent at the head of the chasing pack			1
statistically , at least , @entity0 appear to be in a reasonable position			1
third in the league on the back of a six - game winning run , their improvement has been enough to prompt captain @entity16 to suggest this week that a 21st title triumph could yet be theirs			1
with the busy festive period now on the horizon , what are the reasons for @entity0 ’s improvement and can manager @entity22 really take his team all the way in the first half of 2015 ? @entity22 's @entity0 look to have crept into the @entity4 title race follwing six straight wins @entity29 is a habit @entity0 ’s form has , in all honesty , been rather up and down			1
in his more candid moments , @entity33 probably realises that he could count the number of really convincing performances on the fingers of one hand and still have room for a mince pie			0
however , there were signs against @entity43 at @entity44 last sunday that suggested , for the first time in a long time , that @entity0 had rediscovered the belief that was always there during the sir @entity48 years			1
@entity0 were n’t comprehensively better than @entity43 in winning 3 - 0 , but at no point did you think they would lose			2
on the counter , @entity0 played with a conviction and edge that always suggested that , whatever happened in their own penalty box , they would manage to put it right in the other one			1
it was not dissimilar to the way @entity43 themselves felt at the back end of last season and look what it almost did for them			0
@entity16 ( centre ) celebrates scoring the opening goal against @entity43 as @entity0 head for victory @entity0 were n’t comprehensively better than @entity43 in winning 3 - 0 but never looked like they would lose @entity68 names @entity69 as @entity70 discovered to his cost last season , a playing squad that is n’t fully behind its manager can quickly fall apart			1
conversely , a less - than - perfect group of players can over-achieve if they are driven forwards by a close bond and a belief in what their coach is doing			0
this time last year , senior players at @entity44 — such as @entity83 and @entity84 — already had serious reservations about @entity70 and @entity48 ’s successor suffered as a consequence			2
so far this time , @entity33 has had no such problems and , crucially , he has quickly gained and maintained the trust and support of players such as @entity16 , @entity93 and @entity94			2
@entity16 and @entity33 acknowledge each other during sunday 's 3 - 0 win over @entity43 players in the @entity0 dressing room listen to these voices and it is the @entity44 squad ’s belief in their coach that has , for example , enabled @entity104 and @entity105 to perform much better as emergency wing backs than anybody ever expected			1
these things can make a difference , especially during periods of transition			0
the decision to hand @entity16 the captaincy was a clever one and it is paying off in terms of the @entity118 skipper ’s performances and day - to - day influence			1
an example of @entity16 ’s current approach is that when @entity33 called him back to the training ground from an appointment on @entity125 to talk about a forthcoming game a month ago , the 29 - year - old did n’t bat an eyelid			2
@entity104 ( left ) has performed much better as an emergency wing back than expected @entity105 ( centre ) is another wing back who has thrived under @entity33 this year at @entity44 ignore the critics @entity33 has made mistakes since he arrived at @entity0			1
he still seems confused about what system he wishes to play and he probably should have bought another central defender in the summer			0
nevertheless , the @entity138 coach has brought an authority and a conviction to the club that is already serving him well			0
united managers — just like their contemporaries at clubs like @entity146 and @entity43 — will never be short of ex-coaches and players telling the world exactly what they are doing wrong			0
@entity33 has had plenty of that , but those who know him stress that he does n’t even hear it , never mind pay attention to it			0
@entity33 can certainly get jumpy in press conferences and does n’t like being reminded of things that have gone awry			0
but the key quality that the former @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 coach possesses is to forget all about it as soon as he has walked out of the room			0
he is 100 per cent convinced that what he is doing is correct and that kind of self - belief is something you can not buy			0
ride your luck @entity0 have had a dreadful run with injuries and only time will tell if any of that is down to @entity33 ’s methods			2
the @entity0 manager has been fortunate , however , that a tiny pocket of players he really needs have managed to stay fit			2
@entity16 is certainly one of those — for many reasons — while @entity181 is another			1
the goalkeeper is on one of those runs of form that you can only dream about			0
his performances against @entity188 and @entity43 not only earned his team victories , but actually stopped them losing			0
take six points off @entity0 ’s tally of 31 in the @entity4 and @entity33 ’s record would look identical to that of @entity70 a year ago and would see them outside the top six with only two points more than @entity195			1
that is how fine the margins are in @entity199 football these days			0
@entity33 and his staff will rightly claim an influence on their goalkeeper ’s form — coach @entity205 has previously worked with @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 — but if a keeper is saving your skin on a regular basis then it ’s best to close your eyes and hope it continues			0
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity181 has been on one of those runs of form that you can only dream about @entity219 denies @entity220 during @entity0 's 3 - 0 win over @entity43 at @entity44 @entity219 has been saving @entity0 recently and has been @entity223 's mvp in their last six @entity4 wins no europe despite the horrors of last season , perhaps the one big favour @entity70 did for @entity0 before he left was ensure they did n’t qualify for the @entity228			1
@entity0 ’s balance sheet may miss the income from regular @entity232 games but @entity33 and his players should be grateful they do n’t have the distraction			2
with the @entity0 squad creaking under the weight of injuries , one can only imagine what may have happened had they had @entity228 commitments to cope with too			2
while we are on the subject , the 4 - 0 @entity241 defeat at @entity242 that seemed to spell crisis back in august no longer looks like the worst result in the world either			0
@entity0 ’s constant stream of free weeks has given them vital breathing space so far			2
@entity33 pictured during their 4 - 0 @entity241 defeat against @entity242 early in his reign united players look embarrassed and gutted as @entity242 beat them 4 - 0 in the @entity241 @entity219 's form has certainly changed and @entity0 now look as if they could contend for the @entity4 title chances ? so far they have not suggested they are good enough to lift the league title , especially when you consider the quality and depth of the two squads above them			1
@entity0 have dug very deep to find a good run of form and @entity33 and his players deserve credit for that			1
however , it must be said that @entity0 ’s performances in taking 18 points from games against @entity269 , @entity188 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 and @entity43 probably merited about half of that total on balance of play and opportunities			2
good finishing and outstanding goalkeeping will only carry you so far and @entity33 knows he still has issues to address in the days and weeks to come			0
his team struggle to keep possession for long periods and the defence — still missing some players — continues to look far too porous , particularly between the central defenders			0
it is worth noting that @entity70 was still being asked if his team could win the title as @entity0 put together a six - game winning streak in all competitions this time last year			1
and look what happened to him			0
@entity33 has started to come good at @entity0 with six @entity4 wins on the trot			1

@entity0 have won their last six @entity4 matches
in his first season in @entity118 , @entity22 has propelled the @entity300 to third place
@entity16 suggested a 21st title could make its way to @entity44
@entity181 in fine form and is a major *factor* in *upturn* in fortunes
