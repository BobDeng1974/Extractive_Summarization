@entity0 run in three tries in straightforward win victory for the @entity0 seals an eighth place @entity5 finish for 2013 - 14 defeat for the @entity7 was their 16th straight league loss in a torrid season @entity0 cruised to a comfortable 23 - 13 win over @entity7 at @entity11 to clinch eighth place in the @entity5			1
@entity13 and @entity14 grabbed close - range first - half tries to put the @entity0 in charge and ensure the @entity7 ' run without a @entity5 win would be extended to 16 matches			1
@entity20 added a conversion and two penalties for the @entity0 to two from @entity23 before a late flurry saw @entity25 add @entity0 's third try in the 79th minute and @entity7 @entity29 @entity28 score in stoppage time with @entity31 adding the conversion			1
on the ball : @entity25 scored @entity0 ' final try in their 13 - 23 win at @entity7 on saturday up for it : @entity0 ' victory at @entity7 sees them finish the season eighth in the @entity5 @entity7 made a bright start with @entity40 and @entity41 making penetrating runs which eventually led to tackles being penalised			1
@entity23 knocked over both in the third and seventh minutes for a 6 - 0 lead			0
but @entity0 's well - organised line - out drive made it look easy for hooker @entity48 - @entity13 to claim the first try for the @entity0 in the 12th minute to make it 6 - 5 , @entity20 failing to add the conversion			2
it seemed @entity53 must score when he raced away after snapping up the ball in broken play just inside his own half but the scrum half was chased down by @entity23 and caught just 10 metres short			0
the @entity7 were happy to escape when @entity53 dived into the scrum to concede a penalty			0
@entity0 looked the more threatening and some heavy - duty pick and drives ended with @entity63 diving in to concede a penalty which @entity20 kicked after 28 minutes to ease the @entity0 8 - 6 ahead			0
@entity7 wasted a couple of chances when they failed to win their own ball at a line - out five metres out and then @entity69 was hauled down just short of the corner flag after clever footwork from @entity72			2
consolation : @entity28 ( bottom ) scored a late try for @entity7 who finish the season in 11th position but @entity0 dominated the closing minutes of the half as flanker @entity14 crashed through from close range again and @entity20 's conversion secured a 15 - 6 interval lead			1
the @entity7 started the second half well with @entity85 bouncing off a couple of tackles but their inability to hang on to the ball was proving costly and they spent the next 10 minutes defending during which @entity20 kicked a 57th minute penalty for 18 - 6			0
@entity7 did rally briefly with @entity40 barrelling through again and the ball went through several pairs of hands in a brief flurry down the left but @entity31 's attempted chip was charged down and @entity0 broke out of defence to move back into the @entity7 half and dominate the last quarter			2
miserable season : despite avoiding relegation , @entity7 's defeat was their 16th consecutive in the league @entity20 kept the @entity7 pinned in their own 22 and they could even afford a missed penalty from @entity103 with three minutes left because @entity25 crashed over a minute from time with the home defence shredded			1
the @entity7 did , at least , have the last word when @entity28 rumbled through deep into stoppage time and @entity31 added the extras .			0

@entity0 run in three tries in straightforward win
victory for the @entity0 seals an eighth place @entity5 finish for 2013 - 14
defeat for the @entity7 was their 16th straight league loss in a torrid season
