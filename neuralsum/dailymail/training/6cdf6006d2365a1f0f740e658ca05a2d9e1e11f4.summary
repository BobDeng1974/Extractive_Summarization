by @entity0 , @entity1 editor the locks are being removed from thousands of supermarket trolleys in a move designed to take the fuss out of shopping			1
the security devices became part of the everyday experience of supermarket shopping more than 20 years ago , amid a rise in thefts because of their scrap value			2
however , @entity14 believes that the introduction of sophisticated @entity17 systems , coupled with barriers and bollards designed to stop them being taken off site can provide sufficient protection			1
soon to be a thing of the past : morrisons are removing the locks from 150,000 of their trolleys to make shopping easier and quicker for their customers easier shopping : @entity14 stores like this one in west @entity31 will become trolley deposit free currently , customers need a £ 1 coin or token to operate the locks , before wrestling the trolley free and then do a tour of the store			1
however , company bosses say that people find them difficult and inconvenient to use , while many do not have the right change , which is enormously frustrating			1
the locks will come off 150,000 trolleys at some 279 mainstream outlets , however they will remain at some 228 sites - either in city centre sites which are a particular crime risk or sites in hilly locations where there is a danger they will roll away			2
the supermarket ’s research found that 43per cent of customers find trolley locks inconvenient , while more than one in four – 27per cent - do not always have the right change			1
@entity59 , the chief executive , said : ‘ our nation is getting busier			0
we have less free time than previous generations and customers have told us that they want a quicker shop			0
‘ the removal of trolley locks is just one of the many improvements we are making to our store – to make for a faster and easier shopping trip			0
’ soon shoppers wo n't have to fiddle in their pockets for a £ 1 coin before they can do their shopping at @entity14 a spokesman added : ‘ we are putting our trust in the public and hoping people will not take them			1
where trolleys are abandoned , we are asking customers to let us know so that we can collect them			1
’ shoppers have been turning away from the big box outlets of all the major supermarkets because the idea of spending precious hours at the weekend touring the soul-less aisles has become too much of a chore			0
the move by @entity14 is part of a scheme to make it a more pleasant experience , which also includes extending opening hours , redesigning 277 outlets , refurbishing store cafés , lavatories and baby changing areas , and building new petrol stations			0
other stores are making the own efforts to improve the appeal of the bigger superstores			2
@entity105 , for example , has introduced outlets of the family restaurant @entity107 and the @entity111 + @entity110 coffee shops			0
the trolleys are expensive to buy because they contain aluminium , which means they also have a good scrap value for thieves			2
twenty years ago , around 100,000 trolleys were stolen from supermarkets across the @entity120 every year , however the figure has fallen sharply following the introduction of locks and other security measures			0
apart from the cost and inconvenience of constantly needing to replace the trolleys , which can cost more than £ 80 each , stores can also be prosecuted for allowing them to be abandoned			1
a few years ago , @entity105 ran a trial which involved placing a spy chip in the trolleys which meant that if a customer tried to take them off site , the rear wheels would be triggered to automatically lock .			0
