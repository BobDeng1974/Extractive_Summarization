a coroner has cleared an expedition company of neglect over its responsibility to protect an @entity5 schoolboy who was mauled to death by a polar bear			1
@entity8 , 17 , was on an adventure holiday to the remote @entity11 islands , north of @entity12 , in august 2011 with the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) when he was fatally attacked by the ‘ aggressive ’ animal			1
following a week - long inquest into his death , @entity17 , assistant coroner for @entity18 and @entity19 , today cleared the expedition company of any wrongdoing			1
@entity8 , 17 , was mauled to death by a polar bear on a trip to the @entity25 in august 2011			1
right , the corpse of the polar bear , which behaved ' unusually and aggressively ' because it had severe tooth pain he told the hearing in @entity31 that although the group were missing items of equipment including parts of the tripwire alert system , @entity13 had not acted with ‘ neglect ’			1
he said : ‘ i do not find that neglect is appropriate to be considered , as failure ( by @entity13 ) was not total or complete			0
’ mr @entity8 , from @entity31 , @entity18 , was sleeping in his tent when the bear went on the rampage , inflicting fatal injuries to his head and upper body on august 5 2011			1
four others were hurt before the bear was shot dead at the camp site , where the group - known as @entity49 - had been staying			2
also injured during the incident were trip leader @entity51 , from @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , from @entity55 , @entity56 , from @entity57 , and @entity58 , from @entity59 in @entity60			2
in his narrative verdict , mr @entity17 said : ‘ on the 5th august 2011 , @entity8 was in a tent on a snow bridge near to the @entity64 in @entity11 , @entity12 , as part of an expedition			1
‘ a polar bear was able to enter the camp shortly before 7.30am undetected as the tripwire alarm system around the perimeter of the camp had failed to activate due to a supporting post more likely than not being knocked over by the bear which caused the cartridge to move or fall out of the mine without it detonating			1
‘ @entity8 emerged from his tent and was in the act of standing up when the bear reared up and slammed down on him with its paws pushing @entity80 to the ground where the bear then mauled his head , face and neck causing the injury which lead to his death			1
the inquest into mr @entity8 's death heard how the polar bear ( pictured after it was shot ) attacked the camp the camp site where @entity8 was mauled to death			1
witness @entity94 said : ' the bear reared up and then slammed itself down on to @entity80 ' ‘ at the time of the attack the polar bear was 24 years of age , hungry and in pain from bad teeth which more likely than not made it more aggressive and unpredictable			1
’ the inquest heard that the tripwire system provided by @entity13 worked ‘ inconsistently ’ and had missing parts meaning it had to be set up in triangle shapes rather than the expected larger rectangles			0
it also heard how group members had modified the triggering mechanism using paper clips			0
the inquest was told that the group members were expected to be kitted out with pen flares to scare off a bear but there were insufficient available and were only distributed with the group leaders			2
the hearing was also told that mr @entity51 attempted to shoot the bear with the group ’s @entity121 but his first attempts were unsuccessful because of the safety catch mechanism which ejected the rounds rather than fired them			0
mr @entity51 was praised for managing to shoot the bear after reloading the rifle after he himself had been attacked and seriously injured			1
in his ruling mr @entity17 said that he believed the modifications made to the tripwire had improved the system			0
he said : ‘ i find it more likely than not the tripwire system was improved following the modifications			0
‘ i find , having the benefit of hearing from both the leaders and members of the @entity49 , it ’s more likely than not they had been tested successfully			0
’ he added that a tripwire system was not ‘ 100 % foolproof ’ and said he believed the bear had hit one of the posts causing a loss of tension leading to the mines failing to fire			0
he said : ‘ on balance of probabilities i find that the corner post had been knocked down by the polar bear on entering the camp as the remaining two posts were still upright			1
’ expedition leader @entity153 , 31 , ( left ) fought off the polar bear that killed 17 - year - old @entity8 ( right ) mr @entity17 said that the use of a tripwire system instead of a bear watch was compliant with @entity12 law			1
he also ruled that the distribution of pen flares to the group members could not have helped mr @entity8 as they were not designed for use in close range and would have taken 20 seconds or more to assemble			1
he also said that they would not have been usable in the circumstances			0
mr @entity17 ruled that mr @entity8 had received fatal injuries immediately from his contact with the bear and mr @entity51 could not have saved his life even if he had managed to fire the rifle on his first attempt			1
he also ruled that the rifle was probably in the safety catch position when mr @entity51 first tried to fire it			0
the coroner described how a post-mortem examination of the bear found it was and had worn - down teeth which could have led to it being ‘ stressed , aggressive and more unpredictable ’ than a younger bear			1
he said : ‘ i find that on balance of predictability that the behaviour of the bear was more aggressive and unpredictable than the majority of younger bears that were encountered in @entity11			1
’ mr @entity17 adjourned the hearing last friday after listening to legal submissions , including from @entity188 who was representing the @entity8 family			2
the @entity191 schoolboy was described as ' a fine young gentleman with amazing potential ' ms @entity195 , in submissions , told the coroner that mr @entity8 ’s parents , @entity198 and @entity199 , wished him to consider the issue of ‘ neglect ’ in his conclusion			2
the couple , as well as mr @entity8 ’s grandfather , @entity205 sir @entity207 - former @entity206 chief of the general staff and president of the @entity13 - attended all of the week - long inquest			2
during the inquest , ms @entity195 criticised @entity13 for providing ‘ unsafe ’ equipment , particularly the tripwire system which she said was designed to protect chickens from foxes , not a campsite from a polar bear			1
she said : ‘ the fact that this child @entity8 was in a campsite which was not protected was down to the society ( @entity13 )			2
‘ the equipment that was sent out was not the suitable type of equipment in the first place			0
’ in an independent report into the bear attack by high court judge sir @entity226 , commissioned by @entity13 , he criticised the society for its reliance on the tripwire system			2
he said that a bear watch should be used instead and also called for an overhaul of rifle training			0
sir @entity199 concluded : ‘ in future a bear watch must become the norm for expeditions to @entity11			2
there needs to be complete review of available tripwire systems but they should be treated only as a secondary protection device			0
there needs to be a rigorous upgrade of rifle training			0
’ mr @entity17 said that he would not be preparing his own list of recommendations as he believed sir @entity199 's suggestions and @entity13 ' implementation of them was sufficient			0
he said : ‘ i do not believe it is necessary for me to make such a report on this occasion			0
’ lieutenant general @entity252 , from @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , who is executive director of the @entity13 , said the organisation had adopted all of the recommendations made by sir @entity199 in his report			0
he added that he had accepted that the equipment was unsatisfactory and explained that the @entity13 was working with a company to build a new system which was being trialled in @entity263			0
mr @entity252 said : ‘ in principle , we have accepted in the future it will be safer if there is a wire and a bear watch			0
’ ‘ this is not a fly - by - night organisation , we tasked a high court judge to carry out an independent inquiry which was not required , we are absolutely an open book			0
