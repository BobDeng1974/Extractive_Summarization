by @entity0 last updated at 12:25 pm on 2nd february 2012 smile : @entity2 arriving at court yesterday his full name was @entity2 but everyone in court knew him as ’ @entity7			2
he made a final adjustment to his dark blue suit and put one hand on each side of the witness box			2
then , for more than two hours , the man tipped as the next @entity15 football manager took centre stage in a tax - evasion trial upon which his proud reputation is staked			1
it began as the @entity2 show – a testimony delivered in high - speed @entity22 , punctuated by laughter and one - liners			2
among them was the claim that he had been too busy ‘ thinking about who was marking @entity29 ’ in his @entity32 team ’s match against @entity34 to pay attention to a form he signed transferring money into his @entity40 account in 2003			1
but the mood turned sour when he accused a police officer of staring at him in court – and clashed with a prosecution lawyer in heated exchanges under cross-examination			2
just two minutes of the @entity48 and former @entity32 supremo ’s evidence at @entity51 had elapsed before he cut through the legal niceties to tell the jury : ‘ i ’ve always paid my tax			1
i ’d rather pay too much tax than too little			1
’ and no , he insisted , the 100,000 dollars his friend and former chairman @entity57 set up for him in an offshore account in @entity40 was certainly not a bung			1
this was the first time @entity63 - born @entity2 , 64 , had the opportunity to explain in person to a jury why he is not guilty of trying to cheat the public purse by avoiding tax on the money			1
he told of how he became employed at @entity32 by @entity57 after leaving @entity70 in 2001			2
' paid too much ' : @entity2 , seen leaving @entity51 , said he hired the best people to make sure he paid his taxes correctly it was a meeting over a cup of tea in a hotel in the @entity77 which secured him a job he loved ; a contract eventually worth a total of £ 4.3million ; and eventually a place in the dock next to the billionaire businessman who became his friend , benefactor and co-accused			2
the offshore ‘ investment ’ mandaric made for @entity2 is at the centre of the tax evasion charges			1
@entity90 says the money @entity57 paid into the @entity40 account was a bonus for the £ 3million profit @entity32 reaped from selling striker @entity95 for £ 4million , and that tax should therefore have been paid in the @entity97			1
under a previous contract , @entity2 would have been paid 10 per cent of the transfer fee for @entity95 ’s sale			0
but the contract had recently been revamped to give @entity2 higher wages and bonuses but 5 per cent of the transfer fee			0
co-accused : @entity57 , pictured arriving at court , denied that @entity2 was ' greedy ' @entity2 was ‘ not a happy bunny ’ afterwards , he agreed			0
@entity107 says the @entity40 money was to compensate his loss – a claim which both men deny			1
@entity2 agreed yesterday he had travelled to @entity40 with his wife @entity112 to set up the account			1
much of his time was taken up by a bank official talking about @entity116 , he said			1
he declined the bank ’s offer of taking the paperwork away with him , he said , telling the jury : ‘ it would have been a waste of time giving me a load of forms			2
' i would probably have left them on the deckchair when me and @entity112 went to the beach in the afternoon			0
’ fans of @entity2 queued for seats in a packed public gallery yesterday as he gave evidence a few yards from the gaze of his football pundit son @entity135			0
one spectator denied a seat peered through binoculars from outside			0
inside , the man himself provoked laughter from lawyers , jurors and the @entity144 as he answered questions from his barrister @entity146 , @entity147			0
managing : @entity2 was back to the day job as he was on the touchline for his @entity48 side 's win over @entity152 on tuesday night but the mood changed when he pointed to detective inspector @entity154 in the well of the court and barked : ‘ mr @entity154 , would you stop staring at me ? i know you are trying to cause me a problem			1
’ @entity2 then turned to judge @entity159 and apologised			0
under cross-examination by prosecution qc @entity161 , he again appeared to lose his temper when asked if he knew how much money @entity57 had paid into the @entity40 account , named @entity165 after @entity2 ’s dog and his year of birth			1
old times : @entity57 gets to grips with @entity2 when the pair were respectively chairman and manager of @entity32 @entity2 insisted he had ‘ no idea , not a clue ’ about what had gone into or out of the account , and had n’t asked @entity57 about it			1
mr @entity161 then pointed out @entity2 had told the @entity177 into football corruption in november 2006 that he thought there was about £ 120,000 in it			0
@entity2 said : ‘ i ca n’t remember where i got that figure			0
’ he pointed out the figure was incorrect			0
@entity2 also said @entity112 , his wife of 44 years , was terrified when police set off the burglar alarm in an early - hours raid at the couple ’s luxury home at @entity189 , @entity190 , in 2007 , while he was away watching a match in @entity192			0
he said : ‘ my wife thought i had probably been killed in a plane crash			0
’ both @entity2 and @entity57 deny two charges of cheating the public purse			0

@entity48 manager : i pay too much tax rather than too little
had ' no idea , not a clue ' about what went in or out of @entity40 bank account named after *pet* dog
