by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 17:26 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 19:14 est , 15 february 2013 hanging on : the head of the @entity4 , sir @entity3 , was clinging to his job last night after fresh attacks from politicians and grieving families the head of the @entity4 was clinging to his job last night after fresh attacks from politicians and grieving families			1
they insist sir @entity3 should pay the price for presiding over the @entity13 hospital disaster that cost the lives of up to 1,200 patients			1
earlier this week it emerged he also ignored warnings about another hospital trust under investigation for the needless deaths of 670 people			2
health secretary @entity22 increased the pressure on sir @entity3 by condemning a culture of ‘ institutional self - preservation ’ within the @entity4			1
as the row intensified yesterday : mr @entity28 revealed he had told sir @entity3 targets were being put ahead of patients at @entity32 hospitals four years ago – but he was removed , paid off and forced to sign a gagging clause			1
on wednesday , he ignored a threatening email from @entity4 lawyers to give an interview to the @entity37 in which he attacked sir @entity3 and said he was not interested in patient safety			1
the second whistleblower is @entity40 , the former chairman of @entity41 , and mr @entity28 ’s former boss			2
he said he sent a letter in july 2009 to sir @entity3 , warning that patients could die there because managers were being forced to meet unrealistic targets			2
he claimed the @entity4 chief executive failed to investigate the detailed allegations properly			2
under pressure : grieving families insist sir @entity3 should pay the price for presiding over the @entity13 hospital disaster that cost the lives of up to 1,200 patients mr @entity40 says he left his job in 2009 after being threatened with suspension when he refused to commit his organisation to meeting national waiting targets			1
‘ i was put under pressure by @entity4 bureaucrats to force @entity28 to leave , but i refused because he was doing a good job of shielding the organisation under relentless pressure to put targets first , ’ he said			1
‘ i wrote to @entity3 in the hope that the full weight of my concerns may be taken seriously			2
the allegations were serious – i actually referred to the possibility of becoming another @entity13 hospital calamity – but the inquiry did not look at safety or the breaches of the codes			2
’ mr @entity22 did not directly attack sir @entity3 yesterday but called for a ‘ culture change ’ in the @entity77 , which currently puts ‘ targets ahead of everything else ’			1
not happy : whistleblower @entity28 , pictured , spoke of the ' @entity82 ' nature of the @entity77 and of ' battlefield scenes ' at the hospital where he was forced to quit as chief executive speaking on @entity86 ’s @entity87 he added : ‘ too much of the system is concerned with institutional self - preservation instead of actually getting to the bottom of whether there are patient safety issues			1
’ mr @entity22 said he had written to the chief executive asking why mr @entity28 was gagged , adding : ‘ the first thing a good organisation does when it hears of something that ’s gone wrong is to investigate whether there ’s any truth in the allegations and get to the bottom of it			1
’ meanwhile two @entity103 mps on the @entity105 health select committee have called on sir @entity3 to consider his position			1
@entity107 , mp for @entity108 , said : ‘ i ’m deeply uncomfortable that he remains in position			0
‘ i do feel moving forward that the only way in which we are going to get the changes needed is if there is a change in leadership at the very top			0
we ’ve got to end this incessant culture of the revolving door of management leadership			0
’ @entity120 , a former gp who is mp for @entity123 in @entity124 , said : ‘ @entity3 would set an example of leaders taking responsibility for their organisations , not scapegoating , if he stepped down			2
’ yesterday a campaigner who helped expose the @entity13 scandal delivered a letter to the prime minister calling for sir @entity3 to go			1
@entity133 , 51 , who founded cure the @entity4 after her mother died at the trust , said : ‘ we believe sir @entity3 has presided over the worst disaster in the history of the @entity4			1
‘ he is the person in charge and he needs to be sacked			0
we need a leader that inspires and galvanises those working in the @entity4 and i ’m afraid this man does n’t			0
’ other campaigners have set up a petition on a government website calling for him to resign			0
more than 2,500 have signed it			0
sir @entity3 , whose annual salary package is £ 270,000 , insists he is ‘ not ashamed ’ to still be in his post because the failure were ‘ system wide ’ rather than individual			1
he has faced increasing calls to resign since a report into the @entity13 scandal was published last week			0
he was in charge of the regional body supposedly overseeing @entity13 but which failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care			0
sir @entity3 also appointed the trust ’s chief executive – even though he had had no formal training – who axed more than 50 nurses			1
as chief executive of the @entity167 he is said to have dismissed warnings from relatives of patients who died , saying they were ‘ simply lobbying ’			1
up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died unnecessarily at @entity13 between 2005 and 2009 and many others suffered ‘ inhumane ’ and ‘ degrading ’ neglect			2
demands : health secretary @entity22 , left , increased the pressure on sir @entity3 by condemning a culture of ‘ institutional self - preservation ’ within the @entity4			1
campaigner @entity133 , right , has called for sir @entity3 to go wealthy : sir @entity3 earns £ 270,000 a-year as the chief executive of the @entity4 this month , the @entity4 has been rocked by two of the most serious scandals in its history			1
and , at the centre of both , stands the @entity186 sir @entity3 , its £ 270,000 - a - year chief executive			1
most reasonable people , we suspect , will find it astonishing that he did not resign last wednesday , when a public inquiry revealed the most appalling , inhumane neglect at @entity192 , when he was the bureaucrat in charge			0
if anybody in the private sector had presided over a failure which led to the deaths of up to 1,200 people , they would have been sacked			0
but sir @entity3 is a man without shame			2
he only offered token contrition , and insisted he would not resign as it was a system failure			0
now – thanks to whistleblower @entity28 – we are learning more shocking details of another cover - up involving sir @entity3 , at the @entity41			1
first , sir @entity3 ignored warnings by mr @entity28 that an obsession with targets was resulting in squalid conditions on the wards that were almost certainly costing lives			1
then sir @entity3 ’s side - kick , @entity212 ( later a dame ) , began a campaign which led to mr @entity28 being sacked as the @entity216 ’s chief executive – and gagged with £ 500,000 of taxpayers ’ money			1
who do these people think they are ? they use our money to give themselves huge salaries			0
then , when someone complains about their incompetence , they again use our money to gag them			0
this paper believes it is incredible that – while hundreds of police are arresting journalists for hacking into celebrities ’ phones – not a single @entity4 bureaucrat has had their collar felt over the countless deaths of terrifyingly vulnerable people			2
but then these high officials and quangocrats – so reminiscent of the commissars in @entity242 – are @entity244 ’s new elite			0
they demand the salaries and all the perks of high - flying executives in the private sector			0
but there is a crucial difference			0
in the private sector , when things go wrong , heads fall			0
in the @entity4 , it is the fault of ‘ systemic failure ’			2
the @entity37 is not in the business of calling for people in public life to resign			0
but so egregious are the outrages that have taken place under sir @entity3 that we support those victims ’ relatives who demonstrated outside @entity266 yesterday to demand his head			1
every day this modern day apparatchik remains in post is an affront to morality , justice – and the patients whose lives he destroyed			0
sir @entity3 could face further pressure if mps on the commons public accounts committee decide to quiz him over his expenses next month			1
the @entity37 has revealed he has spent £ 6,000 of public money on trips to @entity281 – where his wife lives			2
many of the visits spanned long weekends , prompting speculation he was using taxpayers ’ money for private purposes			0
it emerged last night that doctors , nurses and managers responsible for the horrific neglect at @entity13 hospitals could be charged with manslaughter			0
police are to consider whether they have enough evidence to prosecute individual members of staff over the scandal			0
so far not a single member of staff has been prosecuted or even sacked over the deaths between 2005 and 2009			0
hard - hitting : this is the front page of last thursday 's @entity37 an inquiry into the disaster published last week refused to scapegoat individual medical staff or managers – and instead blamed failures across the system			2
but mr @entity22 has since urged police to investigate cases saying it was ‘ outrageous ’ nobody had been brought to book			1
last night @entity13 police said they would be carrying out a joint probe with the @entity317 to see if they had enough evidence to press for criminal charges			1
a spokesman said charges could include manslaughter or criminal neglect			0
officers will review the 1,900 pages of the inquiry published last week and cross reference it with existing evidence , he said .			0

sir @entity3 is clinging to his £ 270,000 - a - year job
it follows the @entity13 hospital disaster - costing 1,200 lives
he also ignored warnings about another hospital trust under investigation
a whistleblower has now spoken of the ‘ **stalinist** ’ nature of the @entity4
whistleblower @entity28 spoke of the ‘ **stalinist** ’ nature of the @entity77 and of ‘ battlefield scenes ’ at the hospital where he was forced to quit as chief executive
a second whistleblower broke his silence to say sir @entity3 ignored written warnings about failings in the same @entity32 hospital
mr @entity22 wrote to all trusts demanding they justify their use of gagging orders
police revealed they would be investigating whether criminal charges could be brought against @entity13 staff
relatives of the @entity369 victims marched on @entity370 and called for sir @entity3 ’s resignation
two mps from the health select committee also *suggested* he quit .
