more than half of adults are now expected to get cancer at some point in their life , research shows			2
the risk is increasing so quickly that experts fear as many as two - thirds of today ’s children will develop the disease			1
charities said yesterday that the @entity13 could face a ‘ crisis ’ if it does not plan ahead for the increase in cases			1
the projections are the most accurate calculations to date from @entity27 , which had previously estimated that one in three @entity28 would develop cancer			2
they take into account the effects of modern lifestyles – namely poor diets , lack of exercise , how many of us sunbathe and smoke			1
the number of cancer cases is also set to rise due to longer life expectancy and improved healthcare			1
@entity41 : 96 per cent of women survive for at least one year , 87 per cent do so for five years , and 78 per cent for a decade			0
skin cancer : 88 per cent of men survive for five years or more			2
for women the figures are even better , with 92 per cent predicted to survive for at least five years			0
@entity47 : just 8 per cent of men survive for five years or more , compared with 12 per cent of women			0
prostate cancer : some 85 per cent of patients survive for five years or more			2
@entity52 : 59 per cent of men survive for five years or more			0
for women , the figure is 58 per cent			0
the chances of surviving the illness have increased substantially in recent decades thanks to earlier diagnosis and more advanced treatment			1
at least half of patients can now expect to live for at least ten years , at which point experts say they are effectively cured			0
the new figures , published today in the @entity65 , show the average lifetime risk of getting cancer for anyone born after 1960 is now 50.5 per cent			1
it is slightly higher for men ( at 53.5 per cent , compared with 47.5 per cent for women ) because they are more likely to smoke			0
the study , published in the @entity65 , looked at the risk of being diagnosed with cancer for those born between 1930 and 1960			2
for the oldest age group the odds were under 40 per cent , but the risk rose steadily with each passing decade			2
professor @entity79 , an expert in cancer trends who is based at @entity82 , predicted that for today ’s children the chances of getting the disease would be about two in three			0
he added : ‘ if people live long enough then most will get cancer at some point			0
but there ’s a lot we can do to make it less likely like giving up smoking , being more active , drinking less alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight			0
’ preventative steps : one expert said children could reduce their risk of having cancer in later life by giving up smoking , being more active , drinking less alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight			1
( file image ) @entity103 , @entity27 ’s chief executive , warned that if the @entity13 ‘ does n’t act and invest now ’ then ‘ we will face a crisis in the future – with [ survival rates ] going backwards ’			1
however , he added that ‘ for some types of cancers we effectively do have a cure ’			0
‘ if you look at testicular cancer we ’re up at survival rates in the high nineties now , ’ he said			1
the latest figures show there are around 331,000 new cases of cancer in the @entity28 each year , most commonly in the lung , breast , prostate and bowel			0
despite improved survival rates , our figures lag well behind those of other @entity127 countries			1
they are particularly low for elderly patients			0
a @entity131 spokesman said : ‘ cancer survival rates are now at their highest ever level , and we are on track to save an extra 12,000 lives this year			1
‘ but cases of cancer are likely to rise with an ageing population – so we are focused on earlier diagnosis , improving care and tackling preventable cancer			1

cancer risk is increasing due to longer lifespans and better healthcare
modern lifestyles - poor diets , lack of exercise , smoking - also a factor
charities said @entity13 could face ' crisis ' if it does not plan ahead for increase
earlier diagnosis and advanced treatment means survival rates are better
