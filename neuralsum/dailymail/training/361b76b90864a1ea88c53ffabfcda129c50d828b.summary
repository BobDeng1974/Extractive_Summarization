the @entity0 awarded a contract on wednesday to a @entity3 company that will build a fleet of helicopters to replace the @entity7 fleet that ferries @entity9 presidents short distances			1
the contract , given to @entity12 , will cost an initial $ 1,244,677,064 ' for the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the @entity16 program			2
' for that price the @entity17 will get six test aircraft and all the necessary research & development			2
the @entity0 made a similar attempt to replace the aging fleet of @entity12 choppers , spending $ 3.2 billion on a landing pad to nowhere			1
adding in the likely $ 17 billion price tag for the new project – a number estimated by the @entity29 – the $ 20 billion total makes the fleet the most expensive helicopters ever built			1
@entity7 - to - be : an artist 's rendering shows what @entity12 's proposed ' @entity36 ' presidential helicopter might look like seeing double ? if the current fleet of presidential choppers looks a lot like the new one , it 's because the same company will build them , and it was the only firm to bid on the project the @entity29 reports that the projected cost also ' does not include costs to keep the 19 existing presidential helicopters in operation until they are replaced by new helicopters			1
' during a @entity53 fiscal responsibility summit a month after president @entity51 took office , @entity56 @entity55 sen. @entity55 mocked the boondoggle helicopter upgrade project that was later shelved			2
' your helicopter is now going to cost as much as @entity60 , ' @entity55 said			0
' i do n't think there 's any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money			0
' @entity51 replied that he had asked then - defense secretary @entity68 for a ' thorough review of the helicopter situation , ' and joked that he did n't see the project as very important			0
' the helicopter i have seems perfectly adequate to me , ' he told lawmakers in the room			0
' of course , i 've never had a helicopter before			0
maybe i 've been deprived and i did n't know it			0
' the @entity77 reported friday that the 23 or more new choppers based on the @entity80 medium helicopter will be delivered , but not until 2022			0
that means @entity51 , whose administration has green - lighted the expense , will likely never ride in the shiny new aircraft			0
the aircraft will meet exacting standards , including the capability for encrypted communications and secure videoconferencing with people on the ground			0
they must also have systems that can defend against missile attacks , and shielding to guard electronic components against energy waves produced by nuclear explosions			0
not exactly bullet - proof : president @entity99 was the first to use a helicopter to travel to and from the @entity53 , using this @entity101 until @entity12 could deliver a specially designed replacement all - weather beast with built - in snow blower : @entity7 took off in the snow in march with president @entity51 aboard , en route to @entity108 the challenge has proven daunting , even for the most experienced military contractors			2
according to the @entity111 , @entity12 was the only company to bid on the project , raising questions about whether or not the military is paying a fair market price			1
a former senior @entity0 official told @entity117 on background that the @entity0 tried to encourage other aircraft manufacturers to compete for the award , but none were interested			1
he joked that for what the military is paying , ' @entity7 should be able to have a solid gold toilet for the president – except that it would add too much weight			1
' the need for 23 choppers to serve one president can be explained by the minimum of two decoys – and as many as five – that fly to @entity108 whenever he hops from the @entity53 to a waiting @entity60			1
and whenever @entity51 travels , duplicate helicopters are flown on cargo planes in advance , so one can be fueled and waiting when the plane touches down .			1

the *tab* for a new helicopter fleet will likely top $ 20 billion , including $ 3 billion spent between 2005 and 2009 on a program that was later *canceled*
the new contract will *buy* 23 @entity146 helicopters at an estimated cost of $ *400* million each – about the cost of the @entity60 *747* jet
duplicate choppers fly as decoys whenever a president takes off from the @entity154 ; others are flown to @entity51 's travel *destinations* in advance
just one company bid on the project , raising questions about whether the @entity17 got a fair price
a former senior @entity0 official said for the price , the new aircraft should have a ' solid gold toilet *...* except that it would add too much weight '
