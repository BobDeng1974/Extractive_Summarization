published : 19:44 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 04:48 est , 9 april 2013 criticised : @entity0 has been attacked for giving @entity1 a clean bill of health in the run - up to its collapse the chairman of the new @entity8 regulator is facing calls to step down for failing to sound the alarm about reckless lending at @entity1			1
@entity12 boss @entity0 previously chaired the accountancy firm @entity13 , which has been criticised for giving @entity1 a clean bill of health in the run - up to its collapse			1
the calls came as @entity17 refused to push for former @entity1 chief executive sir @entity18 to be stripped of his knighthood or demand that his pension be slashed for his disastrous stewardship of the bank			1
between 2008 and 2011 @entity24 , which took over @entity1 under a government - backed rescue deal , racked up £ 46billion of losses from bad loans made by its former rival			2
@entity31 , the former head of risk at @entity1 who was sacked in 2004 shortly after he raised concerns about the bank ’s reckless lending , said : ‘ the position of @entity0 as head of the regulator is clearly untenable			1
‘ this is the man who chaired a company which failed to check @entity1 ’s accounts properly			2
’ last night the @entity12 hit back at accusations of a conflict of interest and insisted that mr @entity0 will not be involved in the regulator ’s report into the demise of @entity1 , due to be published later this year			2
the authority said : ‘ @entity50 was subject to a rigorous appointment process by @entity52 , and had an appointment hearing with the @entity54 , to assess his suitability for the role			2
’ @entity13 said the firm ‘ stands by the quality of its audit ’			0
@entity60 yesterday signalled that the prime minister will not intervene over sir @entity18 ’s knighthood as he did last year when he called for @entity64 to lose his over the collapse of @entity66			1
officials said the government would investigate ways of holding @entity1 executives to account , but not until the @entity12 review and a report by the @entity73 are completed in the coming months			0
refused : @entity17 has ignored calls for former @entity1 chief sir @entity18 , right , to be stripped of his knighthood after his disastrous stewardship of the bank last year mr @entity17 said the @entity80 ’s @entity79 , which decides on honours , should look at sir @entity64			1
but yesterday @entity82 said the prime minister would not be referring the case of sir @entity18 to the committee			0
the row will add to a growing fury over his gold - plated pension worth around £ 700,000 a year			0
if @entity1 had been allowed to go bust , rather than being rescued by @entity24 , he would have received a fraction of this			0
the @entity94 , which rescues the pensions of failed firms , sets a cap on how much it will pay workers who have retired early , like sir @entity18			0
in 2008 – when @entity1 would have gone under – it set a cap of just £ 24,788 a year for people of his age , then 52 , who had taken early retirement .			0

call comes as @entity17 refused to strip bank *'s* former chief of his knighthood
