this is the amazing scene as a freelance photographer risks his life to capture an image of a hungry lion from just a few feet away			1
@entity5 , 38 , from @entity6 , @entity7 was in the city 's safari park when he spotted the male lion in the distance			1
mr @entity5 got out of his car and crept up towards the hunter armed only with a camera and fired off a few frames			1
@entity5 crept to within 10 feet of the hungry lion before leaving the safety of his car to lie on the ground armed only with a camera , mr @entity5 , managed to capture a couple of frames before retreating to safety unfortunately , the clicking sound of the camera 's shutter alerted the lion to mr @entity5 's presence , who was forced to retreat quite rapidly from just 10 feet away from the lion			1
he said : ' i was sitting in front of him just near my car and the door of my car was open			2
i was sat on ground few feet away , so he was treating me like his prey			2
' i was thinking - i must show the character and status of lion and this was the only way i could think of to achieve this			0
' the story finished in few seconds as the lion aggressively jumped towards me and i just about scrambled into my car			0
' was laughing at that time , but now when i think back about the incident i do nâ€™t think i would be able to do it again			0
it was a pretty close encounter			0
