it seems @entity2 's favourite table at @entity4 's restaurant holds no bad memories for @entity6 despite being reduced to tears at it last week			1
the tv presenter was spotted crying her eyes out last saturday in the company of the advertising mogul , but hours later they were seen arriving at his house with her suitcases in tow			0
@entity17 and @entity6 returned to the scene of the teary crime on sunday , as though to prove the point that they are happier than ever			1
back on track : @entity2 and @entity6 return to @entity4 '' s a week after she was spotted crying in his presence there she looks happy : the couple were clearly putting the teary incident behind them no hard feelings : clearly the table does n't hold any bad memories for the couple it seems @entity6 manged to put any issues from earlier in the day behind her to stay with the millionaire art collector last saturday evening			1
@entity2 , 70 , was seen arriving home ahead of her , alongside his daughter @entity36 and appeared to be in a jovial mood as he was spotted playing around in the street			1
@entity6 's arrival was rather more understated and she was helped out of the car by her driver who carried the bags to the door for her			1
making a change : @entity2 changes up his style in a blue suit and white shirt while @entity6 wears floral - detail trousers all is forgiven ? @entity6 is seen arriving at @entity2 's house after they reportedly rowed last saturday good spirits : @entity2 was seen arriving back with his daughter @entity36 a little while earlier moving on : it seems that whatever happened earlier in the day has been put behind the couple she wore the grey jacket that she was seen wearing earlier in the day at @entity58 , draped over her shoulder			1
earlier in the day she had been seen apparently wiping back tears from her face outside the couple 's favourite restaurant in @entity64			1
the exchange comes almost a year after @entity17 was seen rowing with his now ex wife @entity66 in exactly the same spot			2
let me in : @entity6 was seen ringing the bell while a gentleman held her bags waiting : it seemed to take a bit of time before someone answered the door bell his now girlfriend appeared to become overcome with emotion during their three hour lunch , however lawyers for both parties have denied there was an argument			1
however the images are still likely to raise questions about whether the couple ’s nine - month romance is on the rocks			0
onlookers claim the pair were indeed arguing and @entity6 , who barely touched her food , burst into tears as the argument escalated , hiding behind huge dark glasses and smoking anxiously			1
‘ she was a bag of nerves , ’ said one onlooker			0
‘ her hair looked all ruffled and her make up was smudged			0
at one stage she removed her sunglasses to wipe away tears			0
’ @entity105 : @entity2 and his daughter @entity36 appeared to be in a jovial mood as they arrived back the art mogul drank almost a full bottle of red wine and smoked copiously during the lunch at what has become their restaurant of choice			1
@entity6 was also smoking but does not drink			2
as the meal ended , @entity17 stalked off towards the taxi rank while @entity6 sat alone at the table for a moment as if trying to compose herself			1
she then followed him to the waiting cab			0
when contacted by @entity123 , @entity17 denied there had been an argument			0
he emailed : ‘ why not send a photographer to @entity4 ’s tomorrow lunchtime , and i will give @entity6 a good throttling in time for your deadline ? ’ it is perhaps unfortunate that the images emerge as @entity17 admits for the first time that he is a ‘ narcissist ’ who can not hold on to a woman			2
previously : @entity6 gets passionate , and weepy , in a heated debate with stone - faced @entity17 outside @entity4 's restaurant last saturday in an astonishingly frank interview with @entity143 ’s @entity142 , a magazine to commemorate the school ’s traditional @entity146 celebrations , he concedes that his self - obsession destroyed his three marriages to @entity149 , @entity150 , and @entity66			1
‘ if you are a narcissist as i am , you may find it difficult to hold on to your wives , ’ he says , in his most candid confession so far			0
‘ i never quite comprehend how it is possible to tire of my company , but it clearly is , and with reliable frequency			0
upset : a tear runs down her cheek ‘ personally i find my own company perfectly exhilarating , but not when i ’m alone			0
’ but , perhaps most tellingly , he offers a hint that @entity6 is not slated to be wife no 4 , saying : ‘ i always propose to a prospective wife on our second date			2
i feel that if they can handle a couple of suppers they will have a grasp of what to expect			0
but no , they always seem to give up the struggle , leaving me anxiously seeking another lifetime companion			0
’ the sentiments about his relationships may or may not come as a surprise to @entity66 , 54 , who was pictured apparently being ‘ throttled ’ by @entity17 outside @entity4 ’s in june last year			2
he first dismissed the row as a ‘ playful tiff ’ but later accepted a police caution			0
@entity6 removed her glasses and glared at him and appeared to shout the couple ’s ten - year marriage unravelled after the publication of the pictures			2
she filed for a ‘ quickie ’ divorce and it was granted the following month			0
just eight weeks after their divorce was finalised , @entity17 started to date @entity6 , best known for the tv show @entity197			2
she has told friends they are ‘ hopelessly in love , but there have been claims she is increasingly frustrated by @entity17 ’s reluctance to both show affection in public and take their relationship to the next level			0
the @entity123 asked @entity6 , and in reply received a response from lawyers acting for both her and @entity17 , denying there had been any falling - out			1
first course : a @entity4 's lunch last year led to @entity17 and @entity66 's split			1

arrived at @entity2 's house carrying a suitcase and large bag
@entity2 returned earlier alongside his daughter @entity36
seen having public row in @entity64 , which left @entity6 in tears that day
spat with @entity6 was at the same table as attack on @entity66 which led to split
lawyers for both deny there was any falling - out and he says : ' there was no argument '
