by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 19:06 est , 8 october 2012 @entity2 fans will be thrilled to know that manufacturers in @entity4 have already begun producing the smaller sister of the @entity6 just in time for the device 's november release			1
dubbed by the industry as the ' @entity10 '			1
manufacturers say the company has put in an order for 10 million of the tablets , showing the company 's strong faith in their newest product			1
insiders say the @entity10 will be announced on october 17 , a few days from the @entity19 's @entity18 and @entity21 's surface tablets releases , and go on sale november 2			1
@entity2 's 9 - inch device dominates the market , but smaller , cheaper tablets have been eating away at the @entity6 's popularity			1
the @entity10 launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per cent - own a tablet , with another three per cent regularly borrowing someone else 's tablet for web browsing			1
about 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year			0
the @entity45 survey by the @entity46 also suggests the flood of cheaper tablets , such as the @entity49 or @entity18 , are weakening @entity2 's grip on the market			1
a year ago , @entity2 had more than 80 per cent of the market , but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent			1
the @entity18 has 21 per cent of the market , meanwhile @entity55 's @entity54 tablet has eight per cent			1
out of those surveyed , 44 per cent of adults who said they have a smartphone , 46 per cent have an @entity59 phone , 38 per cent , have an @entity60 and 10 per cent have a @entity61			0
@entity2 's ipad mini is expected to so on sale around the world on november 2nd , according to online speculation			1
the launch date was reported by @entity67 , which cites @entity2 investors hearing the date from ' multiple sources '			1
the device is believed to have similar hardware to last year 's @entity6 , but reduced to a pocket - friendly seven or eight - inch form			1
@entity67 reports that @entity2 will send out invites for the launch on october 10 , gathering tech journalists and stakeholders together to unveil the device			1
@entity19 , meanwhile has already enjoyed huge success in the @entity45 with its updated @entity81 tablets - but will release them internationally for the first time on the 25th october			0
the gadgets , are available in both 7 - inch and 8.9 - inch versions ( although only the 7 - inch version is currently set to go o sale outside of the @entity45 )			1
the third contender is @entity21 , with its surface tablets			0
the firm will launch the surface tablet at the same time as @entity92 , the latest version of its desktop operating system , which experts say is a ' make or break ' time for the firm			0
' it 's a dangerous game , as all three firms are trying to steal each other 's thunder , ' said @entity101 of gadget @entity102			0
' @entity2 tend to be more cagey			1
' if i was @entity2 , and knew that @entity21 was launching , i 'd probably try and come up with something to take the focus away from them - and nobody else can do that in quite the same way @entity2 can			1
' @entity111 believes that @entity21 has so far played its cards close to its chest with the @entity115 firm has not even confirmed a price for the gadget			0
' @entity21 is the most interesting - it 's a make or break thing for them , as they have always struggled with touchscreen interfaces			0
' it has the potential to be a success - but the worry is that it will be overcomplicated compared to the @entity6			2
' however , it is @entity2 's ipad mini that is expected to attract most attention			2
' the ipad mini is potentially huge , ' said @entity111			0
' but a lot will depend on price			0
there are a lot of people who would like an @entity6 but ca n't afford one , so if it does launch and is £ 250 , it will be very difficult for anyone to beat			2
' experts also believe that @entity19 's @entity18 , which is being launched outside the @entity45 for the first time , could be let down if not enough content is available			2
the gadget uses @entity19 's own app and film and book stores			0
@entity144 famously ruled on a smaller @entity6 , saying ' the current crop of 7 - inch tablets are going to be @entity147 , dead on arrival			2
' we do n't think you can make a great tablet with a 7 - inch screen			0
' however , devices like the @entity154 and @entity156 's @entity155 have shown that there is a market for smaller devices that consumers can use on public transport , causing @entity2 to reportedly change its mind on an ' ipad mini ' with a 7 or 8 inch screen			2
the firm has reportedly placed orders for ten million of the devices , which are also likely to feature the firms controversial new connector			0
' @entity18 is a difficult one , especially in the @entity170 , ' said @entity111			2
' it is dependent on its content delivery , and they will have to have a lot of @entity170 content at launch for it to work - but @entity18 is a very strong brand now			2
. however , @entity111 also believes that the technique could also backfire - by confusing consumers			0
' it is quite possible consumers will get confused , ' he said			0
' after the @entity60 launched , a lot of competitors came out , and people did get confused			0
the @entity6 will continue to be the benchmark , the danger for @entity21 and @entity19 is that people will ask ' can it do what an @entity6 does ? ' most secrecy has surround the @entity10 , a shrunken version of @entity2 's market - changing tablet , is expected to launch on october 17 , with the device available in shops on november 2			1
if @entity2 follows previous form , the event will be held in @entity196 , with a simultaneous launch on @entity198			2
images purporting to show the @entity10 suggest a device measuring 7.85inches , with an aluminium back - cover similar to the most recent @entity6			1
it is likely to sport a rear - facing camera and come with @entity2 's newest ' lightning ' connector , a controversial re-design which made previous accessories and chargers obsolete without an adapter			2
if @entity2 follows its usual design styles , it is likely to come in white and black versions , with a choice of @entity215 only , or a @entity217 option			2
the device , while still likely to garner a premium price - tag , will help @entity2 compete with the burgeoning smaller tablet market			0
the 7 - inch @entity49 tablet sells for £ 159 for the cheapest version , while @entity19 is also producing a budget tablet range			0
@entity144 was unconvinced that a smaller tablet would be a success , seeing it as a poor compromise between a tablet and a phone			0
however @entity2 appears to have had a change of heart , particularly now that the tablet market has now matured			0
one issue @entity2 might face by launching a @entity10 is a fragmentation in its core product lines			1
until the release of the @entity60 , @entity2 's two product lines had kept the same screen resolution , meaning apps did not need redesigning for different devices , a problem that plagues the competing @entity59 platform			0
but with the increased screen size of the @entity60 , some apps now have a black border , at least until the developers update their apps , and this problem may now afflict @entity2 's tablets , depending on the final size of the @entity10 .			1

*unprecedented* timing will see three launches this month
@entity10 , @entity255 and @entity18 all set to go on sale
*estimates* claim @entity2 has ordered 10 million @entity6 minis
