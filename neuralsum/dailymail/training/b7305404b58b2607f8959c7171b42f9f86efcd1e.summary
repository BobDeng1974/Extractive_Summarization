imagine a diet on which you were permitted to stuff your face with biscuits while still losing weight			1
have you imagined it ? right			0
well , now you can stop imagining , because there is one eating plan that claims to let you do precisely that			1
the only catch is that you 're only allowed six , specially formulated biscuits per day			2
so no reaching for the custard creams			0
and the biscuits are instead of meals			0
so put down that cutlery			0
dr @entity17 's @entity16 , founded by @entity19 - based weight - loss expert dr @entity17 in 1975 , is a retro , meal - replacement eating plan of the same ilk as @entity24			1
and it 's coming to @entity26			0
can you lose weight by eating biscuits ? dr @entity17 's diet claims to let you lose weight by eating low - calorie meal - replacement biscuits the diet involves swapping breakfast , lunch and any snacks in between for just six of the brand 's special 90 - calorie biscuits - available in flavours including butterscotch , cinnamon oatmeal , chocolate brownie , blueberry , banana and maple syrup - or nine of the little 60 - calorie ones			1
you are permitted to eat a healthy , sensible dinner - just so long as your daily calorific intake does not top 1,200 calories			0
the cookies - which , according to @entity52 , made her then - husband @entity53 lose his sex drive in 2008 - are made from fibrous grains such as oats , fruit and amino acids			1
a week 's supply will set you back upwards of £ 41.50 , and the diet claims to help you drop 10lb per month			1
weight loss made easy ? the diet claims to enable you to lose 10lb per month but nutritional therapist @entity64 does n't believe that nutritionally restrictive diets of this nature are the key to long - term weight loss : speaking to @entity69 , @entity64 said : ' eating six cookies a day , with only one proper balanced meal is not seen as a healthy approach to weight loss			1
' restricting calories on a diet like this is unlikely to lead to long - term weight loss and may result in nutritional deficiencies			1
since when has balanced nutrition been represented by a biscuit ? ' this looks like another fad diet which is misleading to the public			0
restricting the diet and food choices like this is more like to hinder our health than help it			0
' for sustained , healthy weight loss you need adherence and compliance with a pattern of eating that works for you over time			1
' you 're better off starting a food diary , watching portion size and cutting out high sugar snacks than reaching for the cookie jar			0
' durable and portable : dr @entity17 says he chose to make his low - calorie food take the form of a biscuit because they are easy to carry and fit in a handbag speaking to @entity69 about whether he believes his diet is a healthy way to lose weight , dr @entity17 said : ' decidedly , yes			1
any diet that safely takes weight off someone and gets them to their proper weight is a safe diet , because nothing is more unhealthy than being overweight			2
' people on the @entity16 are not getting the nutrition they need , but that 's the purpose			1
to lose weight you need to eat fewer calories than your body needs			1
' but there 's no question they are getting the vitamins and minerals they need becasue one of the instructions is to take a multivitamin - and in the @entity126 we give free vitamins with packs of cookies			2
' as far as remaining healthy i have enough evidence of that over the years			0
i 've been treating obesity for 50 years and using the cookies since 1975			0
i 've treated half a million patients and we have yet to have the first case of someone not getting enough vitamins			2
' dr @entity17 , right , and his son @entity140 , ceo of the @entity16 , say the diet is healthy and provides clients with all the vitamins and minerals they need dr @entity17 's son @entity140 , ceo of dr @entity17 's @entity16 , added : ' as long as you 're eating fewer calories than your body needs to maintain it 's weight , you will lose eight			1
' and as for whether people will regain all the weight they lost when they resume " normal " eating ...			1
well , if " normally " means their previous eating habits that got them overweight to begin with , then of course they will gain weight			2
but i 'm a big believer in exercise as a means of maintaining goal weight			0
' one of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to losing weight quickly is that once come off the diet you will regain the weight immediately			2
once you reach your goal weight the only thing that will determine whether you gain weight is what you do from that point on			0
' the method by which you lose weight has nothing to do with whether you go back to being overweight after			1
' @entity171 takes you to a goal weight quickly and safely , but what you have beyond that is a lifetime of weight maintenance through healthy eating and exercise			2
' dr @entity17 with a batch of his weight - loss cookies writing on his blog , dr @entity17 said : ' in the early 1970 's , after treating overweight patients exclusively for more than a decade , i came to the conclusion that hunger is the primary cause of diet failures			1
' through trial and error , i had determined that 800 calories a day produces the fastest rate of true fat loss and is quite safe under the supervision of a trained physician			0
' of course , without strong hunger suppression , an 800 calorie diet would be difficult to follow due to hunger			2
i knew that , if i could control their hunger , i could help my patients faithfully follow the low calorie diet that i favored			1
' i decided to try to create a food that was particularly controlling of hunger while relatively low in calories			0
after several years of experimentation in my home kitchen , i developed a blend of particular amino acids ( food proteins ) that proved to be quite hunger suppressing and i baked it into a cookie			0
' i chose a cookie because it 's durable ; does n't need refrigeration ; fits in a purse or briefcase ; and is enjoyed by nearly everyone			0
i was careful to make my cookie taste good but not too good			0
