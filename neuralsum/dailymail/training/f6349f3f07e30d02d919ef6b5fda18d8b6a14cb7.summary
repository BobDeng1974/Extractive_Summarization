by @entity0 a former aide to mp @entity2 has been jailed for possessing a batch of ' explicit ' photos of her policeman lover and his estranged wife			1
@entity8 , 33 , got her hands on the intimate snaps after marrying counter-terror officer @entity11 , 47 , in an @entity13 ceremony in @entity14 in 2009			1
fearing the photos could be about to be made public , his estranged wife @entity15 , who is still legally married to the @entity17 officer , launched a @entity20 bid to block their disclosure			1
last december , the @entity23 mother - of - two won a court order , requiring the politician ’s former pa to hand over or destroy the embarrassing images			2
the former aide to @entity29 mp @entity2 , @entity8 ( left ) with her husband @entity17 detective inspector @entity31 , arrive at @entity32 in central @entity33 but ms @entity34 , of @entity36 , @entity37 , failed to do so and has now been jailed for three months for contempt of court by judge @entity39			1
ms @entity34 , who teaches @entity40 at a school in @entity42 , worked for mr @entity2 ’s @entity44 party before allegations in 2012 that she slept with @entity46 at the mp 's @entity48 home			1
it resulted in the controversial mp for @entity29 writing an open letter to home secretary , @entity52 , demanding an inquiry			2
judge @entity39 told the court : ' it appears that mr @entity11 , on the occasion of a visit to @entity14 , went through a form of marriage with the defendant			1
' as a result , it appears , of each of mrs @entity31 and the defendant sharing the affections of mr @entity11 , the defendant seems to have come into possession of some confidential photographs and digital images of mrs @entity31			1
' mrs @entity31 became aware of the position as a result of exchanges between the parties and consequently commenced proceedings against the defendant , seeking damages and various injunctions			0
' @entity8 , of @entity36 , @entity37 , failed to hand over the photos and has now been jailed for three months for contempt of court by judge @entity39 faced with the prospect of the spat being revealed in open court , ms @entity34 last december consented to an order under which she promised to get rid of the images			1
however , four months later , she had still not shown that she had done so , leading to @entity15 ’s application to the @entity20 to commit her to prison			1
outlining the contempt allegation , barrister @entity85 said : ' an order has been made			2
it was not only made , but agreed to by the defendant			2
she was well aware of its terms			0
@entity44 mp @entity2 gestures from an open top bus outside his campaign office in @entity95 ' she has had multiple opportunities to comply			0
she has failed to do so and she has offered no explanation , even today , for her failure to comply			2
' he said mrs @entity31 , as a mother - of - two , deserved to be able to put the sorry affair behind her in the knowledge that she has won and the photos will not see the light of day			1
representing herself , ms @entity34 complained of having been pressured into consenting to the order last december and said she now wanted to set aside the agreement			1
she said she no longer has any photos of mrs @entity31 , claiming to have destroyed all copies before she had even signed the consent order			2
giving judgment , judge @entity39 said : ' people in your position , when an application is made to be committed to prison , sometimes belatedly do what they have been ordered to do			2
' sometimes people come to court when assigned to deal with an application for committal to prison and say ‘ i ’m sorry , i know i have n’t done it , but i will do it now ’			0
you have n’t said that			0
' what you had to do as a result of the agreement you entered into was very straight - forward			0
you understood what you had to do			0
you simply did n’t do it			0
' it is usually a good idea to look contrite when you come to court when it is said you are in contempt of court			0
jailing her , he continued : ' the defendant has decided from a fairly early point after signing the consent order that she was not going to comply			0
' in all of the circumstances , i have no alternative but to commit the defendant to prison for a period of three months			0
' ms @entity34 , who told the judge she was ' in shock ' , was led from the court in tears by a female security officer			1
she was ordered to pay an estimated £ 10,000 court costs bill			0
mrs @entity31 declined to comment .			0
