it allegedly led to a seriously ill @entity42 man being told he would ' die on the operating table ' by @entity7 if he did not hand over more than £ 10,000			1
ms @entity34 added : ' if a nurse at the @entity81 recommended @entity7 to one victim , knowing what i know , they must have genuinely believed in her			1

she has also been connected to a police probe linked to the @entity107 care home , where her parents lived			1
ms @entity34 , of the @entity35 , admitted police were wrong to dismiss the case in 2007 , when many of @entity7 ’s victims first visited @entity114			2
the senior officer , who along with detective constable @entity116 was highly praised by the trial judge , said : ' it was the wrong decision - and the judge confirmed it was the wrong decision			1
' however , i can understand why that decision was made			0
' ms @entity34 said there was a lot of evidence of more victims , including one who allegedly gave @entity7 £ 600,000 , but did not want to take part in the court case			1
' i believe she ’s been defrauding people for decades , ' she said			0
' i believe it ’s a natural thing for her to do and that she wo n’t even be able to stop herself in prison			0

she funded a luxury lifestyle by extracting huge sums from desperate people , some with terminal illnesses or cancer - stricken relatives			0
her victims were so much under her spell during the 12 - year scam that one woman , who can not be named , had an abortion because @entity7 told her to			2
and another , @entity188 , even sold her home after being told that it was ' spooked '			0
judge @entity137 also condemned @entity7 for trying to pin the fraud on her osteopath friend @entity144			2

they were terrified , in many cases , of the consequences of disobeying your instructions			0
' they lost all their autonomy and they became entirely dependent on you			0
you saw to it that they were cut off from their own friends and family			0

far from having a university education , she was a former cleaner , receptionist and temp. the woman who had an abortion realised she had been scammed and went to @entity42 police station in north @entity9 , but said officers ‘ laughed in my face ’			1
this left her so angry she forced her way into @entity7 ’s home with the help of mr @entity144 , who was paying the rent on that property , and three others			0
inside they found bags of shopping , an abandoned monkey and a voodoo treasure trove – which included drawings of an ‘ evil eye ’ , burned photos and a brand new barrister ’s wig			0
@entity7 would give her ' customers ' detailed instructions about how the money was to be paid - always in cash and in a brown envelope			2
part of her system was to demand a full - length photograph from each victim			0
pet : mr @entity144 had been visiting one flat to feed @entity31 's pet monkey , @entity280 , but did not dare enter the remaining flats for fear they were cursed			0

' i ’m relieved that she wo n’t be doing it to anybody else , ' @entity302 said at her sentencing			0
' i feel terribly sad that somebody who is so clever would resort to that , especially as she was a friend of mine			0
i feel terribly let down that she could behave like that			0
' she relieved me of a lot of money but i ’m still here			0
i was gullible , i suppose , but my sister was very ill at the time			0
' a mother of a ten - year - old boy with @entity315 who was also conned out of £ 42,000 when @entity7 claimed she could cure his behavioural problems			2

her barrister , @entity334 , told the court @entity7 ’s elderly mother had been unwell for a considerable time and she visits her every day			0
