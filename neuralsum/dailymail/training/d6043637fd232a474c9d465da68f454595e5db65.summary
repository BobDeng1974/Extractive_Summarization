air strikes and food drops to help refugees being attacked by @entity18 ( is ) fanatics were not enough , said the prime minister			0
failure to take tougher measures would increase the risk of more @entity25 terror attacks in @entity8			2
calling for ‘ tough , intelligent and patient ’ measures to combat the ‘ long - term threat to the @entity8 ’ , mr @entity3 said : ‘ the creation of an extremist caliphate in the heart of @entity11 and extending into @entity30 is not a problem miles away from home			1
‘ nor is it a problem that should be defined by a war ten years ago			1
it is our concern here and now			0
if we do not act to stem the onslaught of this exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement , it will only grow stronger until it can target us on the streets of @entity8			2
’ humanitarian aid was vital , but not a sufficient response to cope with any long - term threat posed by @entity7 , he said			2
‘ we need a broader political , diplomatic and security response			1
this threat can not be removed by air strikes alone			0
we need a tough , intelligent and patient long - term approach that can defeat the terrorist threat at source			2

he is ready to back calls for more military hardware to be given to the @entity81			0
previously , @entity8 was prepared only to transport weapons on behalf of other @entity84 nations			0
but now mr @entity3 is willing to supply them directly to @entity87 forces fighting @entity7 jihadists in @entity11 – a move that risks drawing @entity8 back into the conflict			1
