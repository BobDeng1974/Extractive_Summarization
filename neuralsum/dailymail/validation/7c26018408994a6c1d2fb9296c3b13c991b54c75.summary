@entity1 full - back @entity0 is expected to be available for the @entity3 showdown with @entity4 as he enters the final stage of his recovery from concussion			1
@entity0 's tenacity and watertight defence were missed in sunday 's 19 - 9 defeat by @entity11 after he suffered a double setback during the return to play protocols having been knocked out against @entity15			1
the 29 - year - old will undertake full contact training on thursday and is on course to be given the green light 24 hours later to face the winless @entity20 at @entity21 on march 14			2
@entity0 has been suffering from concussion and missed @entity1 's defeat in @entity11 last week @entity0 was knocked out while tackling @entity15 's @entity24 at @entity21 last month ' we 're pretty confident about @entity0			1
he 's had a reasonable amount of time now and certainly all the signs from everyone , including from @entity0 himself , is that he 's back to 100 per cent , ' head coach @entity29 said			1
' he has to tick the final box and then i 'm sure he 'll be training on friday			2
he has been symptom free since last week			2
' @entity32 deputised for @entity0 on the afternoon @entity1 's @entity34 dream evaporated at the @entity35 and while he produced some fine moments , he was out - jumped during @entity38 's try in the key moment of the match			1
@entity32 will play for @entity41 at @entity42 on sunday , after which @entity29 insists he will make a call on who starts at full - back against @entity4 when the @entity47 seek to revive their title aspirations			1
' both @entity0 and @entity32 will compete for that 15 shirt next week , ' @entity29 said			1
' @entity0 has a lot of experience and does bring a lot to the team , but @entity32 had a good game against @entity11 and dealt with the high balls well			2
' if you see @entity58 against other teams , he always seems to find grass with his tactical kicking but @entity32 managed to cover all those eventualities			0
' there was a lot of work that came @entity32 's way and he did well			2
i 'm keeping an open mind until next week			2
' @entity0 is set to return to training in a much - needed boost to @entity1 boss @entity29 @entity32 will compete with @entity0 for the no 15 jersey after filling in against @entity11 inside centre @entity72 has a calf injury but @entity75 is ' reasonably optimistic ' he will resume training on tuesday			1
@entity75 's immediate impression after @entity1 had been kicked into submission by @entity58 and his @entity79 half - back partner @entity80 was one of a ' tight test decided by small margins '			1
and having reviewed a defeat that has halted the momentum generated after @entity86 and @entity15 were swept aside in an encouraging start to the @entity3 , @entity75 voices his exasperation at failing to deliver during key moments			1
@entity72 has picked up a calf injury but @entity75 is hopeful that the centre will be fine for @entity4 @entity29 is adamant that @entity58 was the reason between defeat and victory in @entity11 ' there 's frustration that we had n't delivered the level and quality of performance that we 'd hoped to , ' @entity29 said			1
' we knew how difficult it was going to be			0
it was right up there alongside the @entity86 game , if not tougher because of the quality of the opposition and the run they were on			0
' they 're a high - quality team across the board			0
they have a simple gameplan that they execute well , primarily when @entity58 is on the field			0
it changed when he came off			0
' we needed to be at the very top our game to have got a win over there			0
we were n't quite and that was the frustration			0
' there were moments in the second half when they got the try on the back of an advantage from a penalty			0
that left us with a big hurdle			0
' we came back and there were definitely some key moments around the 70th minute when we had a try disallowed			0
' you have to be able to control the big moments and we did n't get enough of those to win the game			0
