by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 is behind bars for a crime she and her family adamantly claim she did n't commit			1
but now legal experts have thrown their support behind the innocence plea , saying that her murder conviction of killing partner @entity10 on @entity11 in 2009 is ' a serious miscarriage of justice '			1
they even went as far as saying the case is the ' worst injustices in @entity17 history '			0
the grandmother and mother - of - two is currently serving a 23 - year jail sentence for the murder of the @entity23 man whilst aboard his yacht - the ' @entity25 ' - on @entity27 's @entity26			1
the day before the murder , the couple had spent the day together on the yacht when mr @entity10 decided he would stay aboard overnight while his partner returned home on a dinghy			1
the morning after , the yacht was discovered half - submerged and mr @entity10 was missing - presumed dead			1
although his body was never found , the prosecutor told the court that @entity33 attacked mr @entity10 and dumped his body in the @entity26			1
while @entity51 has lost two attempts to overturn the conviction , she and her family maintain her innocence			0
and so do the legal experts , reported 60 minutes			0
they likened the accusations of @entity51 to @entity59 's murder conviction of her baby			2
the day after @entity11 , 2009 , mr @entity10 's yacht was discovered half - submerged and he was missing , presumed dead the day before the murder , the couple had spent the day together on the yacht when mr @entity10 decided he would stay overnight aboard the yacht while his partner returned home on a dinghy dr @entity68 ranked the @entity33 case to be the worst injustices in @entity17 history			1
daughter @entity29 , who continues the fight to free her mother , says her faith in the @entity17 justice system has shattered ' the fact of the matter is , the case was carefully tailored to fit a particular outcome and the preferred scenario , ' he said on the program which aired on sunday night			2
' it did n't take into account all the other factors			0
' they include the mystery dna of then homeless 16 - year - old @entity88 found on the deck of @entity25			1
she denied ever being on the yacht and the prosecution said that her dna was on board due to ' secondary transfer '			2
but this was rejected by the @entity97 , which stated in a report that ' there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that the dna detected was the result of a secondary transfer '			0
dr @entity68 believes this is enough to warrant a retrial			1
' you do n't have to establish that @entity108 is innocent , you do n't have to establish that @entity88 is guilty of anything , ' he said			0
' you just have to show that the case put to the jury was incorrect and that would be in itself sufficient to warrant a retrial			0
' another homeless person , this time a man with a criminal history , was allegedly near the yacht at the time of incident			2
the mother and grandmother maintains her innocence as she serves a 23 - year jail sentence in @entity27 but @entity124 was only interviewed by police three years after mr @entity10 's disappearance and a year after @entity33 's conviction			1
soon after the questioning , mr @entity124 left @entity27			2
another one of the prosecution 's claims was criticised by lawyer and former police officer @entity132			0
while the court was told that a @entity25 dinghy had been covered with mr @entity10 's blood , ms @entity132 said an independent expert had verified there had been ' none ' of his blood in the boat			1
ms @entity132 believes the murder case was n't thoroughly investigated			0
' we 're seeing the same error that was made in @entity59 over 30 years ago , ' she said			0
yet new evidence is not admissible on appeal in @entity27 , like most of @entity17			2
daughter @entity29 said her faith in the @entity17 justice system has been shattered			0
but she continues the fight to free her mother with hope that justice will finally be served .			0
