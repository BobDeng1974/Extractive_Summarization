wealthy parents pass on three quarters of their fortunes to their children meaning it will take 300 years for the offspring of today 's super-rich to have average incomes , a survey has revealed			1
the sons and daughters of prestigious families are also likely to live longer than average , more likely to attend @entity12 , live in expensive houses , and go on to become doctors or lawyers			2
there is also little difference in wealth or social standing when the richest families of the @entity22 era are compared to their descendants today , according to the study			1
' the pair examined the records of 19,000 people , including more than 600 rare family names such as @entity47 , the @entity29 , and @entity48			1
@entity50 was responsible for building the world 's first sewer system in @entity53 in the 19th century , the @entity29 family tree contains noted diarist @entity29 , and @entity54 was a judge and royal commissioner			2
they found that , compared to their relatives in 1850 , those living with that surname today are almost certain to have amassed fortunes well beyond the reach of the average @entity63			1
for example sir @entity64 , the great - great - grandson of sir @entity50 , is the founder of @entity67 television production company which created @entity68 and @entity69			0
the company was floated on the @entity72 stock exchange in 2005			0
it trebled in value and was sold for £ 2.5billion in 2007			0
survey estimates three quarters of any fortune is passed from parents to their children , meaning it will take 300 years for the offspring of today 's super-rich to be as wealthy as the average @entity63 the findings of dr @entity37 and dr @entity38 , reported by @entity84 , suggest that the passing down of wealth has a far bigger impact on society than previously thought			1
the data showed a ' significant correlation between the wealth of families ' even up to five generations apart			0
they estimate that three quarters of any estate is passed down to the offspring of wealthy families , despite inheritance taxes introduced in recent years			2
at that rate , it means that children of today 's super-wealthy would take , on average , nearly three centuries to become as wealthy as the average @entity63			1
dr @entity37 and dr @entity38 said : ' @entity106 , @entity107 , or @entity108 – the noisy cacophony of @entity111 politics – makes no difference to the iron law of inheritance			0
' measures to promote social mobility have little prospect of succeeding			0
it ’s always going to be the case that families with the greatest abilities will just pass them on to their children			0

19,000 people surveyed including 600 with rare surnames such @entity29
modern - day descendants just as rich as @entity33 *ancestors* , study found
will take 300 years for offspring of today 's rich to reach average wealth
