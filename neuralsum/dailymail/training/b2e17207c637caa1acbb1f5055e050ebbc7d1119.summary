by @entity0 published : 10:13 est , 29 april 2013 @entity2 : 10:15 est , 29 april 2013 a leading @entity4 doctor believes that many cases of diagnosed adhd are in fact sleeping disorders in disguise			0
@entity10 , a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the @entity12 , says he is treating an increasing number of people with adhd symptoms but who actually have suffer with poor quality sleep			1
for some people - especially children - sleep deprivation does not necessarily cause lethargy ; instead they become hyperactive , forgetful and unfocused , he said			1
disruptive : children who are aggressive , impulsive and hyperactive are often diagnosed with @entity6 but they could be suffering with a sleep disorder , says a leading exoert it was a 31 - year - old patient who alerted him to the link when he came for treatment because he was exhibiting the symptoms of @entity6 ( @entity6 )			1
he was suffering with all the symptoms - including procrastination and forgetfulness - but his problems had only started two years earlier			2
in order to diagnose a person with @entity6 , they must have experienced the symptoms since childhood , he says			0
in an article for @entity42 , professor @entity10 explained that his patient ’s problems first developed the month he began his most recent job			1
it required him to rise at 5am , despite the fact that he was a night owl			0
the professor realised he did n’t have adhd but instead a chronic sleep deficit			1
@entity6 is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness , hyperactivity and impulsiveness			0
it is normally diagnosed between the ages of three to seven , and it is more common in boys			0
although the cause of @entity6 is not known , research shows that it tends to run in families			0
some research also shows that there may be differences in the way the brain works in people with @entity6			2
it is the most common behavioural disorder in the @entity68 and is estimated to affect two to five per cent of schoolchildren			2
there is no cure for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity6 ) , but treatment can alleviate your symptoms and make the condition much less of a problem in day - to - day life			2
@entity6 can be treated using medication or psychiatric therapy , but it is widely agreed a combination of both is most effective			0
he suggested techniques to help him fall asleep at night , such as relaxing for 90 minutes before getting in bed , and when he returned two weeks later , his symptoms were almost gone			0
numerous studies have shown that we get less sleep than we used to			2
the number of adults who sleep fewer than seven hours each night has rocketed from two percent in 1960 to more than 35 per cent in 2011			1
and sleep is even more crucial for children , who need deep for proper growth and development			1
but according to recent research , today ’s youngsters sleep more than an hour less than they did 100 years ago			2
and for all ages , our daytime activities - marked by hectic schedules and all - pervasive technology - often impair sleep			1
the professor hypothesised that while it might just be a coincidence , this sleep - restrictive lifestyle began getting more extreme in the 1990s , the same decade as the explosion in @entity6 cases			1
he went on explain that a number of studies have shown that a huge proportion of children with an adhd diagnosis also have sleep - disordered breathing like apnoea or snoring , restless leg syndrome or non-restorative sleep , in which deep sleep is frequently interrupted			1
one study , published in 2004 in the journal @entity120 , looked at 34 children with @entity6			2
every one of them showed a deficit of deep sleep , compared with only a handful of the 32 control subjects			0
it is possible that @entity6 symptoms can persist even after a sleeping problem is resolved			0
a study of more than 11,000 @entity68 children published last year , found that children who suffered from sleep - disordered breathing in infancy were more likely to have behavioural difficulties later in life			1
children are sleeping an hour less than they did 100 years ago these children were 20 to 60 per cent more likely to have behavioural problems at age 4 , and 40 to 100 per cent more likely to have such problems at age seven			2
interestingly , said professor @entity10 , these problems occurred even if the disordered breathing had abated , implying that an infant breathing problem might cause some kind of potentially irreversible neurological injury			1
there is also some promising research being done on sleep in adults , relating to focus , memory and cognitive performance			0
and a study published three years ago in journal @entity120 found that while people who were deprived of sleep did n’t necessarily feel sleepier , their cognitive performance declined and continued to worsen over five nights of sleep restriction			1
professor @entity10 says we can wait no longer to pay attention to the connection between deep sleep and @entity6			1
he provides the example of clonidine , which began life as a high blood pressure drug , but has now been approved to treat adhd			0
studies have shown that when it is taken at bedtime , adhd symptoms improve during the day			0
he says that for psychiatrists , it is one of these ' oh - we - do n’t - know - how - it - works ' drugs			0
but in fact clonidine is a potent deep sleep enhancer .			0

professor of psychiatry , @entity10 , thinks poor sleep could be to blame
number of sleep - deprived people has rocketed by *33* per cent since 1960
says for some people - especially children - sleep deprivation does not necessarily cause lethargy ; instead they become hyperactive or unfocused
