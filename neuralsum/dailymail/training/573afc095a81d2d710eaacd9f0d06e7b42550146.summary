by @entity1 reporter published : 08:10 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 10:22 est , 31 january 2014 @entity3 claims : according to gps records obtained by @entity6 , @entity4 could n't have been drag racing at the time of his arrest on 23rd january @entity4 was not drag racing at the time of his arrest , new reports have alleged			1
according to @entity6 , who claim to have obtained the print - out of the gps records from the @entity17 had rented and was driving at the time of his arrest in @entity20 last week , the records would have shown a higher driving speed if the 19 - year - old had been drag racing his friend @entity24 , as police initially claimed			1
@entity27 police primarily accused @entity4 and @entity24 of racing at speeds of between 50 and 60 miles an hour			1
however , judging by the @entity6 print - out , the maximum speed reached by @entity4 in the car was 44mph , which was when he left @entity34 in @entity27 at 4.07am , before the speed dropped to a maximum speed of 27mph just two minutes later			1
the website claim that the significance behind the figures is that the 27mph reading came on the 3700 block of @entity42 - where the speed limit is 30mph - and that if @entity4 had been drag racing at that point , the reading would have been significantly higher			1
police had originally claimed they caught sight of the drag race on the 2600 block of the road , before @entity4 was pulled over and arrested in the 4100 block			2
there are also discrepancies in the gps reading from the @entity56 which was reported to have been used to block traffic on @entity42 to allow the drag race to take place			0
the vehicle is n't registered to have begun moving again until 4.06am , and did n't stop until @entity4 was pulled over - dismissing claims that it was used to facilitate the race			2
@entity6 claim that if the gps records are correct , the figures will cause issues for prosecutors in the case , as it will mean that @entity4 's car was pulled over for a reason that does n't actually exist			1
regardless of the gps records , official toxicology reports from @entity4 's arrest show that the singer had marijuana and the active ingredient of @entity81 in his system when he was arrested on january 23rd			1
location : police had originally claimed they caught sight of the drag race on the 2600 block of @entity42 ( pictured ) before @entity4 was pulled over and arrested in the 4100 block the star is pleading not guilty to @entity90 after the arrest			2
involved : gps records from the @entity56 that @entity4 's dad @entity93 ( pictured ) was in also refutes claims that the vehicle had been parked up to facilitate the drag race meanwhile , in the latest alleged criminal episode earlier this week , @entity4 and five of his entourage are accused of assaulting a limousine driver on december 30 after they were picked up from a nightclub			1
@entity104 police released a statement saying the limo driver and an unnamed passenger had an altercation during which he was hit on the back of the head ' several times '			0
the charge is yet another in a string of recent run - ins with the law , but if @entity4 is convicted of assault , federal law allows that the @entity119 could very well be deported and banned from working in the @entity120			2
meanwhile , former @entity122 star @entity121 is the latest person to offer @entity4 some advice in the wake of his difficult few weeks			0
speaking to @entity125 on the @entity126 , @entity121 said : ' things do n't really change much , do they ? if you 're a teenage idol and all the young girls love you , you can lose that pretty quick			0
' you can lose perspective , but you can also lose them in the long run if you 're not a role model			0
hopefully , what he does on stage and the way he dances and the way he sings , he will apply that to his real life			0
' there 's a discipline in what he 's doing			0
apply that discipline to how you want to behave			0
' thanks for the support : @entity4 took to his @entity151 page on thursday night to thank his fans for their continued support			0

records show the maximum speed his vehicle reached was 44mph
upon his arrest , police had accused @entity4 of racing at speeds of between 50 and 60mph
gps records could derail the prosecution 's case against the singer
