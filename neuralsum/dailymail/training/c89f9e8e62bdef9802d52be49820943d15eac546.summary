and today , the monarch , resplendent in a pale gold silk coat and dress with beautiful flower - trimmed hat , was dressed to befit the occasion			1
wearing a pale gold coat of a delicate silk brocade , she added a flash of colour at the lapel with an eye - wateringly large aquamarine brooch from the @entity16 collection of jewels			1
her hat was trimmed on the underside of the brim with a clutch of five silk chiffon blooms in a complementary pale blue tone			1
it was a day to reflect and remember , with a thanksgiving service designed to echo the original @entity1 service held within these same ancient walls on 2 june 1953			1
today the monarch marked the milestone with her family , 2,000 invited guests and the nation			0
the @entity31 missed a royal engagement with the @entity25 on monday night because he was feeling ' under the weather ' , but was well enough to attend the service today			1
the service has been divided into the recognition , @entity56 , homage and @entity57 , reflecting parts of the original @entity1 ceremony			0
the @entity25 arrives with prince @entity31 at @entity60 on tuesday to mark a reign that has weathered six decades of social transformation and the end of her country 's global empire			1
@entity66 / @entity67 ( britain - tags : royals entertainment ) resplendent : the @entity25 decorated her silk coat with a large pale blue sapphire brooch portrait of an outstanding monarch : the queen was rightly honoured in a ceremony that recalled the pomp and pageantry of the original @entity1 service @entity79 : the queen 's 60 year reign has weathered six decades of social transformation and the end of her country 's global empire the majestic @entity86 - with which the @entity25 was crowned - will rest on the @entity87 - the first time the heavy , solid gold , jewel encrusted crown has left the @entity91 since the 1953 coronation			1
the @entity93 , the gold , eagle shaped bottle from which the holy oil was poured for the anointing - the most sacred part of the coronation - also stood on the altar			0
the @entity1 chair from 1953 had been restored to its former glory for the occasion			0
landmark : the @entity105 said this was to be a happy occasion , but the service was nevertheless a solemn affair solemn : the senior royals heard a speech by @entity113 and enjoyed music from some of the choristors who performed at the original @entity1 spectacular : the ancient walls of @entity35 were host to the original @entity1 as well as the ceremony today procession : the @entity123 walk out of the @entity35 after the service warm welcome : the queen is greeted by the @entity127 as she enters the @entity35 , where she would listed to choristers who sang at the @entity1 60 years ago a flask of aromatic oil - taken from the same batch made for the @entity25 's coronation - was processed through the @entity35 , carried by 11 representatives of the people of the @entity136 to the @entity137 , received by the archbishop of @entity139 and placed by the @entity140 on the @entity87			1

one of her favourites : the @entity25 wore a large aquamarine brooch from the @entity16 collection the @entity16 collection , presented to the @entity25 in 1953 by the president and people of @entity156 , is one of the most modern in the @entity25 's extensive collection			1
the set consists of a necklace with nine large aquamarine stones - one of which is a pendant that the @entity25 had embellished with yet more diamonds and made detachable so that she could wear it as a brooch , as she chose to do today			2
the large aquamarine stone , which the @entity25 has worn as a brooch on many occasions , is matched to a bracelet set with large aquamarines in the same tone			0
it took over a year for jewellers of @entity156 to collect enough stones of the correct size and hue to make the set			0
it is said that the @entity25 adored the set so much that in 1957 she commissioned royal jewellers @entity181 to make her a tiara made to match with three vertically set oblong aquamarines			2
as well as wearing the brooch as a separate piece - the @entity25 wore it on the lapel of a blue coat for @entity189 recently - she frequently wears the entire set together , making for a dazzling display			2
one memorable occasion was in 2006 , when the @entity25 hosted the president of @entity156 and his wife at a state banquet at @entity196 - and honoured the president by wearing the spectacular jewels his country had bestowed upon her some 53 years earlier			2
