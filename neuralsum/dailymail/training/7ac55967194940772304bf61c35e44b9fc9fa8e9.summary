@entity12 favourite : @entity7 sprouts contain high levels of vitamin k , which can interfere with blood thinning drugs if eaten to excess the warning came after a man from @entity20 was hospitalised after eating a plateful of the festive greens			1
he had been fitted with a mechanical pump to help move blood from the lower chambers of his heart , after suffering heart failure last year			0
he had also been prescribed anticoagulants , which thin the blood , and his dose was monitored once or twice a week			0
but he was admitted to the specialist heart unit at the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , after his condition dramatically worsened			1
