‘ @entity0 is coming off for @entity1			1
’ it sounds more like two characters from @entity4 than a @entity6 substitution in a heated @entity8 quarter - final against @entity9 , when their future in the tournament is at stake			1
but the swap has been a move @entity16 has played twice			0
in the 68th minute against @entity17 , @entity1 came on for @entity0			2
in the 64th minute against @entity9 , @entity1 came on for @entity0			2
they are hardly the most inspiring strikers to pull on the yellow shirt of @entity20 , after decades – a century , even – of producing supernatural , superhuman , superstar goal - scorers			0
which was offside , and a header from two yards out			0
also a shot on target every 78 minutes			1
that happens to be the total minutes @entity1 has played in the tournament in his two substitute appearances			2
he still has n’t had a shot on target yet			0
of his 20 passes – yes , a whole 20 – only eight have found their target			1
neither play in @entity46 , @entity0 has had nine serious injuries since 2009 and @entity1 managed just six league goals in two years in @entity50 football at @entity51 and @entity52			2
one - man team ? @entity54 has been the @entity8 hosts ' talisman having scored four goals in four games they will surely go down as two of the poorest @entity6 strikers to have played for the @entity62 tournament , @entity54 has been taking the brunt ; not only has he had to carry the hopes of a nation on those slight shoulders , but that pair have been hitching a ride too			1
in total 27 forwards have been tried and tested by @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity16 since 2006 when a replacement for @entity73 was required			0
before then , there was a stream of great strikers			0
@entity73 won two @entity77 , in 2002 and 2006 , and became the all - time @entity8 tournament top scorer with 15 goals			1
@entity81 , who scored more than 1,000 goals in his career and 55 in 70 for @entity20 , and @entity84 , 39 in 75 caps , won the 1994 @entity86 @entity8 together			0
@entity87 amassed 30 goals in 64 caps , winning the silver boot award at the 1986 @entity91 , of course , @entity93 , with his three @entity8 wins , 77 goals in 92 internationals and 1281 goals in 1363 career appearances			0
@entity98 points to @entity73 as inspiration top dog : @entity73 is the joint - top all - time @entity8 goalscorer with 15 goals in four tournaments predator : @entity81 ( left ) scored 55 goals in 70 appearances for @entity20 and was a 1994 @entity8 winner the @entity108 : @entity93 ( centre ) won three @entity77 with @entity20 , scoring 77 goals in 92 international appearances the names go on : @entity113 was top - scorer of the @entity114 with seven goals			1
@entity116 was top scorer in 1950 with seven – four in one game			0
@entity118 was top scorer in 1962 , even though he was more of a target man , like @entity0 , alongside @entity93 who was playing in the role that @entity54 has adopted now			2
it seems unlikely that @entity0 and @entity1 will ever be added to that @entity6 pantheon .			1

@entity0 and @entity1 are two *non-traditional* inspiring @entity6 strikers
@entity0 has scored twice , with a shot on target every 78 minutes at the @entity8 ; while @entity1 has completed eight out of 20 passes
tournament hosts past forwards *include* - three - time @entity8 winner @entity93
