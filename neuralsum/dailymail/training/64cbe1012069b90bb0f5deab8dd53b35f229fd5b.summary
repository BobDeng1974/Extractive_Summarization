by @entity0 published : 12:34 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 20:47 est , 1 september 2013 the sister of the @entity3 user who ‘ confessed ’ to murder on the internet to protect her apparently claimed today that it was all a prank			1
the sister said that it was an ‘ ill - advised prank ’ by her ‘ scrawny gamer ’ brother and that he was just doing it to get more popularity on the @entity11			1
her brother , using the name @entity16 , had claimed that his sister had an ‘ abusive meth addict boyfriend ’ and wrote on @entity3 using a meme that he ‘ killed him with his own drugs while he was unconscious and they ruled it as an overdose			1
’ heavy : the user , named @entity16 , posted a thread to the meme , pictured , with the title ' finally have the guts to say it ' late on saturday night the meme is usually reserved for innocuous confessions so , within minutes of its posting saturday , stunned @entity3 users began commenting on the photo , asking if the disclosure was true and if so when it happened			1
the meme , which refers to anything this is shared and spread across the internet , quickly spread and media outlets began reporting on the possible crime			1
by tuesday , the posting had reached more than 3224 comments			1
the sister however claimed that she had never even known anyone to overdose , let alone a boyfriend			1
the claims are further twists in a mystery which has sparked huge speculation on the internet as to whether the ‘ confession ’ was actually true			1
it has also ignited a debate about how the @entity11 polices itself with claims on @entity3 that one user had tipped off the @entity60			1
@entity61 , national cyber-crime spokeswoman for the @entity60 , said that as a matter of policy it does not confirm if a tip has been received or is being investigated			2
she did add however that it would be local law enforcement that would investigate murders and not the @entity60			2
the sister was tracked down on @entity70 by tech journalist @entity71 using information which was posted on @entity3 but later deleted			1
in her response , she wrote to him : ‘ my brother lives in another country , not sure what he does online			1
it 's an ill - advised prank			1
‘ i know no one who has overdosed and my brother is a scrawny gamer			2
‘ i have seen your @entity80 / @entity70 and would appreciate if you would n't link anything to me as i 'm currently applying for higher level positions in my career			0
‘ as you might imagine , this could adversely affect me			0
i respect your ethics as a reporter doing research and wish you luck , but his attempts at internet " points / karma " have nothing to do with me			0
’ by internet karma she was referring to the goodwill of other users when they approve your comments or posts			2
all a hoax : this is the screenshot of the sister 's conversation with a reporter where she vows that her brother never killed her abusive boyfriend mr @entity71 told @entity106 : ‘ the sister was pretty web savvy and she said she did n’t know what her brother had been doing and that she had never known anybody to @entity111			1
‘ she said she did n’t want to be in the middle of all her brother ’s silly internet games			2
’ mr @entity71 posted the information on @entity3 but was angry to learn he had been made the subject of a @entity117 , which makes it look to other users like you have been banned , even though everything looks normal to you			1
he believes the reason is that he was posting personal information about @entity3 users , which is against its internal rules , so the moderators appear to have effectively suspended his account			1
mr @entity71 said this left him in the bizarre position that the only way he could investigate the story was to write about it elsewhere , so posted a comment on @entity135 about his findings			2
the post which started the story was put up on @entity3 on saturday night with the title ' finally have the guts to say it ' to the @entity143 subforum			1
the thread linked to the meme known as @entity146 , which usually reserved for innocuous confessions so , within minutes , @entity3 users began commenting on the photo , asking if the disclosure was true and if so when it happened			1
in now - deleted comments , other users began unearthing @entity16 's personal details , which were publicly available , including his full name , date of birth , occupation and employer , location and @entity70 , @entity80 and @entity159 account and then began debating whether the authorities should be alerted			1
reddit moderators then removed these details although @entity106 was able to find them still posted elsewhere on the @entity11			2
they show that that the user , who posted under the name @entity16 , appears to be 24 - years - old and originally from @entity166 , @entity167 , which is where he appears to be living now			1
he says he is living in @entity168 but this contrasts with what his sister claims			2
@entity106 carried out a search for him in @entity168 using his personal information but no match came up			0
@entity16 has either been in the @entity175 or is still in the @entity175 and claims in an online profile on @entity178 that he is a @entity179			1
response : @entity16 responded just once , pictured , to the stream of comments , which by tuesday had reached more than 3224 , claiming ' some ' of the confession was true under his hobbies he lists ‘ watching movies , smoking pot ’ , karate , claims to own a snake and says he used to be bipolar			1
his favorite film is the 2009 action movie @entity190 and his favorite song is ‘ @entity194 ’ by 1960s rockers @entity193			0
in addition to being in the @entity175 , he claims his other job is as a ‘ medicinal marijuana @entity200 ’ and in a rambling post talks about how he set up a collective to sell it with his mother			0
the post details how his mother fired him because he ‘ f * * * * * up an order ’ and asks other users to give him advice on whether or not it is his fault			0
@entity106 has been unable as yet to ascertain if this is true or not or if he was trolling and trying to get a rise out of others			0
the post says : ‘ when i asked what was wrong with it she had no answer for me and just told me i was fired			0
‘ when i told her that the shipment arrived after i was off duty and it was the night shift ’s responsibility , she punched me in the face			2
at this point i lost my temper and kicked a piece of furniture			0
i barely skuffed the surface , the mark came out in a second with a paper towel and googone			0
‘ but that was the final nail in the coffin of me working there			0
she said i was violent and impulsive … after getting punched in the face and fired			0
i think i controlled myself pretty well			0
i just want to know from an outside point of view if i was wrong			0
she kicked me out of the building and told me to find my own ride home , since my car is broke and she was my transport			0
i then had to walk for 5 miles in rain and cold with just a thin undershirt ( she had taken my work shirt since i was fired )			0
‘ am i wrong in how i behaved ? was i responsible for what the other staff had done ? someone please help me on this cause i ’m about to break down			0
’ @entity16 has responded to the row and admitted that his confession was not entirely serious but would not elaborate			1
lightening the mood : trying to lighten the mood , he posted a follow up meme , pictured , suggesting the confession was a joke ' first and only comment to be made by me , ' he wrote			1
' i posted this wondering what would happen , there is some truth behind it , but i 'm not saying what was true and what was n't			2
if i had a dollar for every time someone took me seriously on the internet , i would be able to retire from today alone			2
i 'm sorry to anyone that i 've offended to the point of ruining their lives			0
' if you want to catch a murder , get out of your house , put on some tight and go fight crime			0
i 'm quite done with reddit tonight			0
back to the shadows of lurking , the world is n't quite ready for me			0
when his personal information was posted on @entity3 , @entity16 put another post up			1
he wrote : ' edit : the reason for this post and the admittance it was a joke because people started posting my own personal information on there			2
not s * * * that was in my post history			0
' sure you can find information about me but link me to something that happened is completely different			0
i made a meme about something , and it turned into people revealing my personal information			2
it was quite rude and very uncalled for			0
' he also posted a second meme stating : ' if you joke about murder on @entity3 without a throw away account you 're gon na have a bad time			1
' fueling speculation that the confession could be true , he then deleted his @entity3 account , as well as his @entity70 and other social media pages			1
@entity106 is reaching out to police in @entity168 and @entity167 .			0

the user , named @entity16 , posted the meme with the title ' finally have the guts to say it ' to @entity3 's @entity143 subforum late on saturday night
but his sister said today her brother is just seeking attention with the hoax
used the popular @entity146 meme normally reserved for *trivial* confessions
claimed he killed his sister 's meth addict boyfriend with his own drugs and that it was ruled an overdose
after a barrage of comments from shocked @entity330 , @entity16 posted that some of the ' confession ' was accurate then said it was a joke
