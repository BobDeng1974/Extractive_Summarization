@entity0 battled brilliantly against @entity1 in @entity2 on saturday , but were brutally torn apart in 22 minutes as the @entity1 won 28 - 27			1
here , @entity5 's @entity4 winning coach sir @entity3 rates the two teams and gives his verdict on which @entity0 players deserve to start next week 's third and final test			1
took try well @entity14 - 6 showed with last try what he could offer on wing but experiment over			1
an outside centre going forward			2
@entity21 - @entity20 game did n’t flow his way and not a huge factor			2
will he suffer in a possible midfield reshuffle ? down and out ? @entity21 is tackled by @entity10 and may be dropped for the third test @entity26 - 6 some good , and some not so good moments			1
not to blame for turnover try by @entity1 @entity29 learning			1
took his try very well and was busy throughout but needs to address his kicking game			2
@entity34 - @entity33 card was harsh but not playing as well as in the autumn			2
unusually tentative in a few tackles			0
underwhelming : @entity34 kicks for goal and is stopped by @entity38 ( right ) @entity39 - 6 made @entity41 ’s try superbly but first match for three weeks and kicking game looked rusty in first half			0
@entity45 - 6 not as prominent around the park as usual , mainly because it was such hard going in the tight			0
@entity48 - 7 another very fine game by the @entity51 man			0
were @entity0 any better when @entity52 came on ? no. @entity53 - 7 much tougher in the tight but good to see the return of his handling and indeed kicking game ! @entity58 - 7 has been a @entity59 for @entity0 but was much more tested this week against improved @entity61 front five			1
powerhouse : @entity58 holds off a defender and passes in field @entity66 - 7 good lineout presence , hard working — @entity67 is making it difficult for @entity68 to drop him			1
@entity71 - 8 hard working and competitive			1
after the game he insisted defeat was simply not good enough			1
@entity74 ( capt ) - 7 found @entity10 back at his best last night so a much more challenging match altogether @entity77 in the tight going forward although exposed out wide defensively occasionally			2
@entity1 @entity78 in attack and defence			1
wonderful try - saving tackle on @entity82 , brilliant try of his own			0
@entity85 man : @entity1 's @entity78 was the best player on the pitch @entity88 occasional fumble , still not at his very best , but remains an accomplished all round player			1
@entity91 - 8 exceptionally gifted rugby player , world class in everything he does for @entity1			1
@entity95 - @entity94 back from a substandard performance last week			2
took his try well , made another for @entity38			0
@entity38 - 8 probably the world ’s best wing on current form			2
constant threat in attack , strong in defence			1
wide boy : @entity38 showed his class in attack and defence on saturday @entity110 game manager			1
saves big plays for when they are needed — witness his break for @entity78 ’s try			1
@entity116 - 7 quiet first half but electric when @entity1 started winning the collisions after half - time			1
@entity119 - 7 very testing night at the office in @entity121 , more comfortable at scrum - time in the ‘ @entity122 ’			0
@entity124 - @entity123 probably playing for his place after last week but much stronger in the tight			0
much improved : @entity124 beats the tackle of @entity129 and @entity45 ( right ) @entity130 under pressure after @entity132 who answered his critics with a powerful all - court performance			0
@entity136 a world class combination with @entity138			0
rock solid in the lineout , good in open spaces			2
@entity138 - 7 never has a bad match			0
at the core of the pack			0
particularly effective in these high - tempo games			0
@entity146 - 7 a quiet grafter in a team of stars			0
provides the cement but always comfortable ball in hand			0
@entity10 ( capt ) - 8 recovered from missed tackle on @entity41 that cost a try to start really hitting his straps in the second half			0
@entity158 - 7 @entity157 and always formidable going forward , great hands and rugby nous to make a try for @entity162 .			0

@entity14 failed to shine on the wing and should be moved back inside
@entity0 's star performer @entity71 admitted defeat was not good enough
@entity78 was exception in defence and attack for @entity1
