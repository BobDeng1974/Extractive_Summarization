by @entity0 published : 10:05 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 06:34 est , 7 november 2013 they 're there to study - but it must be hard when you live in @entity6 's biggest student house			2
@entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , is home to 32 undergraduates who host parties around the clock in monster digs made up of four huge terraced homes knocked into one			1
each week they collectively down 500 cans of beer , watch 1,300 hours of daytime tv , and eat 100 tins of beans			1
the tenants , all @entity23 students , spend between £ 75 and £ 100 per week to live in the property just a short walk to campus			1
making a mess : eight females and 24 males live in the house , and it needs three cleaners six days a week to keep the place in good shape student meals : @entity36 uses a hob in one of the house 's four kitchens			1
the residents have a loose schedule of who cooks and when to meet their needs it is kitted out with 22 toilets and four kitchens			2
but , in a house where around 50 pot noodles and 150 takeaways are eaten a week , they produce quite a lot of rubbish - 20 bin bags worth			1
no wonder they have a team of three cleaners on site six days a week just to take care of the mess			1
photos taken by housemates of life inside the house show endless parties - with people asleep in corridors and students drinking beer from a bin			1
the 24 males and eight girls are supposed to attend 320 hours of lectures a week , on everything from civil engineering and business to fine art and midwifery			1
but that figure is dwarfed by the estimated 1,300 hours spent watching student tv favourites like countdown - and the 900 hours spent on one of the numerous playstations			1
student @entity83 , 20 , has managed to keep up with his studies while living in @entity85 for three years			2
party time : the students dressed up before a party inside the sprawling property			1
even former students return to let the good times roll drinking games : @entity93 downs a ' beer bong ' while his mates cheer him on			1
constant partying can make the place distracting and ' crazy ' @entity99 pursuits : when students are n't studying , cooking or partying , they can be found playing pool or darts - or hide and seek with the lights out the third - year @entity108 and @entity107 student said : ' we go on several nights out a week and pretty much every night we have a drink in the house - so it pretty much feels like one big party			1
' the house is crazy and intense but at the same time it 's a lot of fun			2
we 're like one very , very big family			2
' we all get on really well and it 's great to have so many different personalities and characters in one house			2
@entity123 is my favourite time of year - last year we had over 50 people over for dinner			2
' knocked through : @entity7 started life as four separate terraced houses , which were knocked through into one complex of rooms heavy night ? while many say that the non-stop drinking can be exhausting - these pale and bloodied faces are not the results of hard partying - but make - up ahead of a @entity137 party no need for furniture : when the fun kicks off in earnest , any part of the enormous property - including halls and floors - are used floor plan : an architectural drawing of @entity7 shows multiple rooms , many of them en - suite , 22 other toilets , seven showers , one bath and three kitchens the cavernous accommodation started out life as four @entity158 properties in the city 's @entity160 suburb , which were originally knocked together into a nursing home			1
in the 1990s it was converted into communal accommodation and is now marketed by a private landlord as an ' a graded student letting '			0
most rooms have en - suite loos and washbasins , and there are 22 other toilets and seven shower cubicles dotted over two floors			0
passed out : not all the rooms in the property are always in use , as one student can be seen here preferring a hard cold kitchen floor to a nice warm bed keeping clean : one of the seven shower rooms , this one is a dual one			0
but students who prefer a bath might need to be a little more patient - as there is only one in the property student life : a world exists outside the property , of course , as can be seen in this photo of students watching the sunrise over @entity8 , @entity9 every now and then , they do some study : @entity196 , 21 , in his room - showing that some serious work does get done multicultural : the students , who come from countries across the globe and are aged between 18 to 24 , study subjects ranging from civil engineering , to fine art to business to midwifery students outside @entity85 house in @entity8 , @entity9 , which is @entity6 's biggest student house it boasts just one dining room but three separate kitchens equipped with five freezers , five fridges , four ovens and four washing machines			1
students can also laze around in two spacious lounges equipped with flat - screen tv 's and @entity221 satellite television , or use a dart board and full - size pool table			1
the property is full from september to july , raking in around £ 11,520 a month and about £ 126,000 a year in rent for the owner			0
feeling woozy ? a student with bins full of booze , about to take a gulp			0
little wonder , then , that the photograph is out of focus cupboard is almost bare : many former university students will look at this image with a pang of nostalgia , and a pang of hunger how many of these freezers contain vodka ? the property also contains five fridges and four washing machines - all being in full use befre and after one of the many parties on average each week the 32 students get through : 40 loo rolls ; 20 bin bags of rubbish ; 100 tins of baked beans ; 20 large bags of pasta ; 500 cans of beer ; 150 cans of cider ; 50 @entity262 ; 150 takeaways			1
each week they collectively spend : 320 hours at lectures ; 311 hours partying at nightclubs ; 1,300 hours watching tv ; 900 hours playing @entity268 ; 224 hours playing pool			1
the sprawling house is comprised of : 32 bedrooms ; 22 toilets ; two living rooms ; three kitchens ; one utility room ; seven showers ( four of which are duo ) ; one bath ; a pool table ; a dart board ; four washing machines ; five fridges ; five freezers ; four ovens			0
@entity7 has a warden who works in an office in the property five days a week , and when he 's not there @entity83 deals with complaints and other issues			1
students cook throughout the evening in unofficial shifts from 5pm to midnight , often teaming up for massive stir - fries before taking turns to do the washing up			2
there 's one space going spare at the moment because two people are a couple - and have moved in to the same room			0
mr @entity83 added : ' we almost have a system in place whereby the longer people have lived in the house , the nicer their room is			0
' as i 've lived here for three years , i 've upgraded from one of the smallest rooms in the house to a large room with bay windows and an en - suite			0
' the great thing is that it 's like living in halls but for three years			0
' i thought about moving out for my third year , as i thought it would be too distracting , but i knew i 'd miss it a lot so decided to stay			0
it 's not for everyone , but i love it			0
' doing a ' starfish ' : @entity327 is ably helped by a number of assistants as he completes a tricky stunt that - of course - involves drinking beer dietetics student @entity333 , 19 , said : ' it 's so much fun living in the house			0
it can be noisy and hectic but i 'm pretty noisy , so it 's fine			0
' the house can be a big distraction and it 's often really hard to stay in when there 's so many people drinking , as it feels like a house party , so i 'll normally end up joining in			0
' after nights out we 'll often discover people who do n't live here who 've slept in the house			0
it can be pretty crazy			0
' @entity350 in the house is a lot of fun			0
we turn all the lights off then hide in random places			0
' old housemates who have left university visit the property regularly to relive their student days			0
@entity359 , 20 , who graduated last year and now works as a waitress , said : ' i live down the road but come here a couple of times a week			2
' i felt it was best i moved out of @entity7 once i decided to leave uni and get a job , because of how distracting it can be , but i still come for all the nights out - there 's no better place for it			1
