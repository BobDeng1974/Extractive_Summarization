by @entity0 for @entity1 a former miss @entity2 is planning a @entity5 - style campaign to get all @entity7 children to sit gcse exams in sex education			1
sex therapist and tv presenter @entity10 believes the way sex education is handled in @entity7 schools is ' hopelessly out of date '			1
now , in a bid to get @entity7 children better informed , she is hoping to follow in the footsteps of tv chef @entity5 who used a television series to campaign for better school dinners			0
@entity22 tv presenter @entity10 is hoping to follow in the footsteps of tv chef @entity5 who used a television series to campaign for better school dinners @entity27 ' hour - long one - off @entity26 show , @entity25 in @entity28 , will argue for a gcse in sex education when it airs and the channel hope a series will follow , it was reported today			1
the programme will feature @entity10 , who is also a @entity34 , visiting the classrooms and homes of @entity7 schoolchildren , working with 15 and 16 - year - olds			1
@entity39 , @entity26 's head of factual entertainment , said : ' the way she looks at the world and sex education is going to be the most marvellous culture clash with even the most liberally minded @entity7 teacher			1
' some of the things acceptable [ in other countries ] – teaching 10 - year - olds all about masturbation – is obviously going to stretch the boundaries of what is acceptable over here , but if you analyse what she is saying it makes complete sense			0
' @entity10 told a @entity22 newspaper the @entity7 has been ' too prudish for too long ' about sex education			1
' @entity64 has just about the highest teenage pregnancy rate in @entity63 , ' she said			0
' now they have finally realised that it is best to teach youngsters about feelings , relationships and sex			0
' @entity10 ( right ) attends an aftershow party following the @entity73 performance of @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity2 but the @entity76 said sex education should be left to parents			1
the society 's safe at @entity82 national coordinator @entity81 told @entity1 : ' they do n't need to spin this out over a gcse ! what are they going to cover ? ' it 's horrifying			1
where are the parents in all this ? ' the big myth is that you need to give children sex education like this to protect them from sexual abuse , but there is no research that shows there is a link between lack of sex education and abuse			1
tv chef @entity5 used his @entity26 programme to campaign for better school dinners in @entity7 's primaries ' it 's just playing on parental fears			2
for a former @entity110 to come in and say this is not helpful			0
we do n't need lessons to titillate teenagers			0
this is not the best approach to ensuring children are protected			0
' parents are the best people to talk to children about these intimate details			0
sex is n't an academic subject , it is a personal matter			1
' the society also warned that much of the teaching in schools already uses explicit material that is inappropriate for young children			0
most state comprehensives already offer sex education as part of the national curriculum			1
but thousands of academies , free and faith schools are not required to teach the national curriculum , meaning they are free to drop the subject			0
provision in primary schools is also patchy , with most not teaching anything until the final years			0
last week the @entity141 announced plans to force all state schools , including primaries , to teach sex education			1
@entity147 ’s schools minister @entity146 committed the party to introducing sex education for all children aged seven and over to help them become ‘ good citizens ’			2
the move , backed by @entity154 but opposed by the @entity155 , would force thousands of schools to increase the amount of sex education on offer			2
countries such as the @entity161 and @entity162 have been held up as examples of a more liberal and open attitude to sex education than the @entity7			2
in the @entity161 , sex and relationship education begins in primary schools for children as young as six			2
it has one of the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in the world			0
@entity7 parents retain the right to withdraw their children from sex education classes , and surveys have frequently shown that many oppose school sex education for young children .			2
