by @entity1 reporter published : 20:12 est , 24 april 2012 updated : 20:23 est , 24 april 2012 problem : @entity3 has the third highest proportion of sexually active teens and some the worst levels of underage drinking @entity3 has the third highest proportion of sexually active teenagers in the world as well as some of the worst levels of harmful underage drinking , it has been revealed			1
shocking statistics published in the medical journal the @entity14 show that youngsters are more at risk from binge drinking , drug taking and sexually transmitted diseases than ever before			1
the research found that sexual activity among 13 to 15 - year - olds was highest among girls in @entity22 followed by @entity23 , the @entity3 and @entity24			1
@entity27 and @entity22 had the highest rates among boys			1
the lowest rates in boys were in @entity32 , and for girls @entity33			2
@entity35 had the fourth highest percentage of youngsters who have been drunk by the age of 13 in a league table of 40 mostly high income countries			1
@entity41 was fifth and @entity43 eighth			2
@entity41 was third for those drinking weekly at the age of 15 , with @entity35 fourth and @entity43 again eighth			1
the figures are taken from 2006 , the last year with internationally comparable data , with new estimates in the coming months set to provide an opportunity for the @entity3 to assess whether policies to reduce harmful drinking among teenagers have had any impact over the past five years			1
teenagers ' general well being has improved far less over the last 50 years than that of children under 10 with evidence suggesting adolescence is not the healthiest time of life , as is often assumed			2
a lack of focus on adolescent health could be described as a ' missing link ' in the approach to health , an international team of scientists warn			2
the statistics are revealed in two studies by professor @entity73 , of the @entity74 in @entity75 , and colleagues which was published in @entity78 on @entity79			2
the first paper says even the explosion in social media such as @entity83 and @entity84 has both good and bad points for young people			2
peer pressure : statistics published in the medical journal the @entity14 show that youngsters are more at risk from drug taking and sexually transmitted diseases than ever before while it enables them to be catalysts for community change , as happened in the uprisings of the @entity99 and @entity100 , it also exposes adolescents to new risks such as cyber-bullying , and sexting , the act of sending sexually explicit or pornographic messages by mobile phone			1
there are now some 1.8 billion adolescents aged between ten and 24 in the world today , comprising more than a quarter of the population			2
the researchers said with longer periods in education , and significant delays to marriage or settling down , the period during which young people are exposed to the risks of adolescence has extended significantly			1
such behaviours include harmful alcohol consumption and illicit drug use with peers , and sex with more casual partners , increasing the risk of sexually transmitted infections			1
prof @entity73 said : ' the present generation of young people will take a different path through adolescence from previous generations and will face new challenges to their health and well - being along the way			0
' programmes to promote maternal , newborn and child health across countries of all incomes have led to more children surviving and the current adolescent population boom , known as the ' youth bulge '			0
over the same period digital media , industrialisation , globalisation and urbanisation have changed traditional family and community influences , resulting in less ' social scaffolding ' of adolescents			0
the researchers said many health - related behaviours that usually start in adolescence such as smoking and drinking , obesity and physical inactivity contribute to the epidemic of non-communicable diseases including heart disease , cancer , diabetes and lung disease			1
new threat : the explosion in social media exposes adolescents to new risks such as cyber-bullying studies on adolescent brains suggest they are more affected than adults by exciting or stressful situations when making decisions			1
increased activity in the nucleus accumbens , a reward and pleasure centre , appears linked to this			0
while the death rate among under fives has declined by 80 per cent or more in many countries in the past fifty years , adolescent mortality has only marginally improved			0
the major causes of disability - adjusted life years ( @entity191 ) , a measure that combines burden of mortality and disease , in adolescents are alcohol use ( seven per cent ) , unsafe sex ( four per cent ) , iron deficiency ( three per cent ) , lack of contraception ( two per cent ) and drugs abuse ( two per cent )			0
prof @entity73 said : ' irrespective of region , most adolescent deaths are preventable and thus strongly justify worldwide action to enhance adolescent health			0
' in view of their dynamic and challenging health profile , the contribution of adolescent health to the global burden of disease , and the important effect of adolescents and their health across the life course , adolescents should be more prominent within future global public health policies and programming			0
' the second paper revealed the @entity3 had the fifteenth lowest rate for adolescent mortality in a league of 27 high income countries			0
the @entity3 was also mid ranking for both boys and girls in cannabis use			0
surprisingly , despite its obesity epidemic , boys aged 13 to 15 in the @entity225 exercised more than boys in any other of the 16 countries reporting data , and @entity225 girls had the second highest levels of exercise behind @entity233 , which was in second place for boys			0
the @entity3 finished eighth best for girls in the amount of exercise they did , and fifth best for boys out of sixteen countries reporting data			0
prof @entity73 added : ' for the largest generation in the world 's history , the available global profile of youth health is worrying			0

youngsters ' more at risk from binge drinking , drug taking and @entity254 than ever before '
@entity14 report identifies new risks including cyber-bullying and ' sexting '
