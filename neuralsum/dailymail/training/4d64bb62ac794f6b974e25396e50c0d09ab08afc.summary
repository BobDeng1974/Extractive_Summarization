i believe i am doing a good job			2
' he said at his home yesterday : ‘ we had had a difficult morning deciding on budget and job cuts			0
i listened to one of the ladies on the @entity36 stall and came out with the comment			1
if only i had not said that			0
the comment was made to @entity40 , advice services manager of @entity36 which complained to the council 's standards committee			1

it 's taken a year and a half for him to be told that he has to write an apology			1
the apology was an insult			2
' it came with a second class stamp and it was folded up into eight small bits			0
he might as well have screwed it up			0
i ca n't believe that the only thing he has had to to is write an @entity91 needs to re-think his job			2
' @entity19 tweeted her disgust at mr @entity3 's comments mr @entity3 's apology letter in which he acknowledges his comments were ' ill - judged and insensitive ' @entity44 , who mr @entity3 made the comment to , said she was unhappy with the apology which ' might as well have been screwed up ' and came in an envelope with a second class stamp her comments have been echoed by the readers of the @entity105 , 97 per cent of whom say he should quit			1

' we are very proud of the disability services provided in @entity36 and wish to totally disassociate ourselves with these completely unacceptable views			2
' and this afternoon @entity19 waded in on the row with a tweet referring to her disabled son , @entity20			1
mr @entity3 told the newspaper : ' i had come to their stall after a long council meeting and i was probably a little bit het up as we had had some difficult debates			1
' @entity19 ( pictured left with her disabled son @entity20 , right ) today condemned mr @entity3 's comments saying ' many disabled [ people ] contribute more to society than mr @entity3 ' @entity132 , chairman of @entity36 , said : ' it is of great concern to us that anyone with such believes , let alone to vocalise them , could be a representative and elected member of our local authority			1
' for such a serious issue and multiple breaches of conduct , bringing the council into disrepute , we did expect no less than this councillor 's resignation			2
' mr @entity3 , who has been a councillor for 25 years , tried to excuse his comments by saying he was ' hot under the collar ' after a morning meeting about council cuts			1
in that meeting he heard that some disabled children were being moved out of the county for care which was ' incurring additional expense '			0
in a letter to the charity mr @entity3 said : ' i am writing to offer my wholehearted apologies for the offences these remarks have clearly caused			1
' while i meant no offence by my remarks to you , i can see , in retrospect , that they were ill - judged and insensitive and should not have been made at all			0
' councillor @entity169 , a @entity170 on @entity11 , said : ' i 'm shocked			2
i ca n't believe that a councillor could even contemplate saying something like that even to stimulate debate			0
for me it is a resignation issue			0
' @entity36 described his apology as an insult after it was delivered by second class post mr @entity3 said : ' we had had a difficult morning deciding on budget and job cuts			1

if only i had not said that			0
' i did n't mean it			0
i did it to provoke a response and debate the issue of service costs provision			0
