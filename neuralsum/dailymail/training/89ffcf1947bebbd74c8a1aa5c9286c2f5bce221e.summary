evidence of planets supporting alien life beyond the solar system will be found within the next 50 years , renowned astronomer sir @entity0 has predicted			1
but those fearing unwelcome visits can rest easy – he says @entity6 is too ' boring ' for extra-terrestrials to bother with			1
the 89 - year - old added he expected people , who could afford it , to become space tourists to the @entity12 , @entity13 and perhaps the outer reaches of the solar system by the end of the century			1
planets supporting alien life could be found within the next 50 years - but it 's likely that any @entity18 will find @entity6 boring , renowned astronomer sir @entity0 , pictured right , claims ' life is out there ' : the @entity24 presenter thinks it is only a matter of time before other planets are found that can support life speaking the launch of his new book @entity31 , he said : ‘ i am sure there is life out there			1
we can not be the only ones			1
‘ i do n’t think we would be on any [ aliens ] tourist list			1
we are a pretty boring planet , orbiting a boring star			2
’ asked if recent discoveries of new planets beyond our solar system meant we were closer to discovering evidence of alien life in the next 50 years , he said : ‘ yes			1
we are not far off			2
he added : ' we have found other planets			2
the next stage is to detect the atmosphere			2
you can [ then ] work out if it has oxygen			2
we would know that supports life so we can look for it			2
’ but he complained that a lack of funding could prevent @entity58 discoveries , warning that the amount the @entity60 had spent on the war in @entity62 - an estimated £ 20 billion - could have funded a comprehensive @entity64 space programme			1
sir @entity0 wrote @entity31 , with his @entity24 colleague , dr @entity66 , from @entity67 , and @entity69 star @entity68 , who has a phd in @entity71 , and is a close friend			1
holiday destination : sir @entity0 said space tourism will hopefully become possible in the next 100 years cost : but sir @entity0 said it was unlikely that @entity58 would be the country making new space discoveries because of a lack of funding - pointing out that the estimated £ 20million spent on the war in @entity62 could have paid for a @entity64 space programme dr @entity66 said @entity82 ’s venture into space tourism would take off and people would pay to travel beyond earth			1
he said : ‘ i can certainly imagine people paying to go to the @entity12 or @entity13			2
further than the solar system and you will have to wait a while			0
to get to the nearest stars would take tens of thousands of years			0
’ sir @entity0 agreed : ‘ in the next one hundred years			1
i hope cosmic tourism will be possible			0
i hope we could go to the [ outer ] part of the solar system			0
distances in space are too vast to go further			0
’ the @entity97 tourist : the new book by sir @entity0 , @entity68 and @entity66 this week dr @entity66 announced the discovery of a new planet , @entity101 , which is around 5,000 light years away			1
it is believed to be six times the size of @entity6 , and has four suns in its sky – it orbits two , and is in turn circled by a pair			0
it was discovered by two “ armchair astronomers ” using data from the @entity114 website run by @entity115 and colleagues , and later verified by experts			0
the website allows visitors to identify dips in the output of stars caused by their light being blocked by ' transits ' of orbiting stars			0
earlier this year , two viewers of the @entity128 ’s @entity126 – @entity129 and @entity130 – used information from the @entity114 website to discover evidence of a new world 3,000 light years away			0
it is believed to be only the third time @entity58 amateurs have found a new planet			1
last month , the @entity69 ’s astronomer @entity139 explained developments in astronomy mean that astrophysicists could be able to view images of distant planets outside of our solar system as soon as 2025 , and potentially discover whether there is some form of life on them			0
he said : ‘ we know now that stars are orbited by retinues of planets just as our sun is			0
we have learned this in just the last decade , essentially			0
‘ within 10 or 20 years we will be able to image other planets like the earth , orbiting other stars			0
‘ that will be a really exciting subject to see if there is evidence for [ extra-terrestrial ] life or not			0

but he claims @entity58 could miss out on making new discoveries because of a lack of funding
