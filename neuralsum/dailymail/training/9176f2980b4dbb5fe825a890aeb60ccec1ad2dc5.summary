@entity0 finds it hard to contemplate the thought — next week @entity4 will , injury permitting , return to @entity5 as a @entity7 player			1
he might once again score a goal which could prove crucial in tipping the two - horse title race in @entity7 ’s favour — just as he did in scoring the equalising goal against @entity12 in september			1
for @entity0 , stalwart of @entity15 ’s greatest @entity12 side , a @entity17 winner , and @entity4 ’s long - time midfield partner , that would be unthinkable			1
@entity4 looking dejected as @entity7 lost to @entity20 in the @entity21 on saturday @entity4 came off the bench but could do nothing to prevent his side from losing 2 - 0 @entity0 has mobilised an army of footballers to help fight @entity27 in @entity28			1
the @entity29 had to deny he was suffering from @entity27 after reports surfaced that he had contracted the virus — but the incident has inspired him and his wife , @entity33 , to campaign against the stigma of the disease , which has claimed more than 8,000 lives since last year			0
@entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 have all signed up			0
he has resisted the opportunity to return to the @entity42 preferring to stay at @entity43 rather than play against @entity12			1
and he is unsure how @entity4 will be able to keep his emotion in check for a game which would be highly charged even in normal circumstances but which is also a critical game in the destination of the title			1
‘ it will be difficult — i do n’t know how he ’s going to do it , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it will be a very strange situation			0
i can not see myself doing that against @entity12			2
’ of course , should @entity43 return to the @entity17 , @entity0 might one day face his former team			1
‘ that would be a bit different , ’ @entity0 insists			2
‘ but with a different team in @entity61 , going back to play your old club when you ’ve been there for so long ... wow ! it ’s going to be difficult			0
but , at the end of the day it ’s another game and he ’s professional			0
’ @entity0 played for @entity12 from 2005 before joining @entity43 at the start of this season he and @entity4 formed a formidable partnership at the heart of the @entity69 midfield for many years @entity0 alongside @entity15 at his unveiling as a @entity12 player in august 2005 despite his own reservations of making the kind of switch @entity4 has , @entity0 is confident that @entity12 fans will receive his former team - mate warmly			1
he was applauded by away fans at the @entity78 earlier in the season , despite scoring the equalising goal			2
but the murky details of his move to @entity7 , which was initially announced as a loan from @entity84 , have turned some @entity12 fans against him , as has the fact that he has turned out to be a crucial player in the title race , contributing valuable goals as @entity7 chase @entity12			1
but @entity0 believes that @entity12 fans will not forget what @entity4 gave the club			1
‘ well , you know how fans are but i believe the @entity12 fans are always going to give him their warmth and respect everything that he did for the club , ’ he said			1
' i ’m sure that they will give him a welcome			0
’ former @entity12 manager @entity101 agrees with @entity0 and says that @entity4 deserves to be treated well next saturday			1
‘ i ’m hoping he receives the kind of reception reserved for much - loved returning players , ’ he said			0
‘ the key point that is sometimes lost in the confusion over whether @entity4 was joining @entity84 or @entity7 — which was admittedly a strange situation — is that @entity12 did n’t offer @entity4 a new deal last summer			1
‘ the club clearly decided they could do without him			0
maybe his opportunities would have been limited , given how strong @entity12 have been this season			2
' but from that point on , @entity4 had to find himself a team			2
perhaps you could understand why some fans were upset with him if he had been agitating for a move or demanding to leave even though @entity12 wanted him			2
‘ but he only left to play for someone else when the club did n’t want him			0
it seems pretty clear that he loves the club and the fans and always will			0
’ @entity4 scored a late equaliser for @entity7 when they faced @entity12 in september the @entity7 midfielder refused to celebrate at the @entity78 after scoring against his old club lampard greeting long - time team - mate @entity123 at the full time whistle after the draw @entity4 will not overshadow the key issue of the day , which is whether @entity12 can open up an eight - point gap with 15 games to play			1
for many that would seem an unassailable lead			0
‘ @entity7 have to get something from the game , ’ said @entity101			2
‘ to get back eight points between now and the end of the season looks tough			0
it ’s one thing to close an eight - point gap before @entity140 but with just 15 games to go would be hard			0
@entity12 they would have to lose three games to close that gap			2
’ @entity0 is of the same mind			0
‘ in @entity61 you can never say the title is decided in january but if they win the game , they will give them a massive advantage , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a big week with the @entity151 semi-final as well but @entity15 loves dealing with these kind of games and will always get the best out of his players			0

@entity7 set to face @entity12 at @entity5 next *sunday*
