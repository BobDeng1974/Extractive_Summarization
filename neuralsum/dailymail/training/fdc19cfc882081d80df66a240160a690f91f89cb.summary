claimant : @entity1 claims she was fired from two @entity4 - starred @entity3 because restaurant bosses did not want diners to be greeted by a black person a receptionist fired from two @entity4 - starred @entity3 tried to sue the restaurant for race discrimination after claiming bosses did not want diners to be greeted by a black person			1
@entity1 had only worked at @entity16 ’s exclusive @entity15 establishment for three weeks when she was let go in september last year , and replaced by a white woman			1

she claimed that on his return mr @entity23 had ignored her , it was ' apparent ' he disliked her , and she alleges she was later replaced with a white receptionist			1
however , staff at @entity3 claimed @entity32 miss @entity18 had poor language skills , was badly organised and did not provide the exceptional level of service expected at one of the best restaurants in the world			1
her case was later dismissed by the tribunal judge			1
' i was dismissed because i am black			2
i was made to feel like one of the oddest employees there , ' miss @entity18 told the @entity44			1
' they treated me differently because i am black			2
' @entity3 does not employ non-white staff front of house			0
this was confirmed by comments from my white predecessor			2
' miss @entity18 was hired on august 23 by the restaurant ’s assistant manager @entity51 , after a day ’s trial			1
she claims she was given the job permanently and signed a contract ; however the restaurant states she was only given a month ’s trial			1
her role was to open the door for customers , greet them as they came in , show them their tables , look after the cloakroom and open the door for them on the way out			0
she denies she had ever been told her work was not up to standard or challenged on any mistakes			0
' there were no complaints about how i fulfilled my role , ' she said			0
' no other staff at @entity3 made any complaint			0
' when mr @entity23 came back from holiday things changed			1
it does n’t make sense to me			0
he treated me differently , he barely talked to me			0
allegations : miss @entity18 has taken the @entity20 restaurant to an employment tribunal , claiming that general manager @entity23 , who was on holiday when she was hired , told her to leave and she believed that the restaurant did not employ black people front of house ' it was apparent mr @entity23 did not like me , he did not speak to me			1
he would often ignore me and not even say hello			0
' she claims the general manager told her on september 11 that would be her last day of work , as she was no longer needed			1
she said : ' i asked why and also if i had done anything wrong			0
mr @entity23 said that my work was good but they did not need another receptionist			1
' i subsequently learned mr @entity23 had recruited a new receptionist , i presumed he had her lined up when he dismissed me			1
she is of white skin colour			2
' as a result of the discrimination i suffered serious injury to my feelings			2
. my esteem and confidence was undermined and i suffered stress as a result			0
' i genuinely believe i have been subjected to race discrimination			1
' however , mr @entity23 vehemently denied his sacking of @entity108 has anything to do with her race			1
he said : ' since it opened in 1967 , @entity3 has always employed individuals with many different ethnic identities in both kitchen and front of house			0
' the allegation that @entity3 does not employ non-white staff is simply not true ; in 2013 alone we employed thirteen non-white employees in our front of house team			0
five of the individuals in the receptionist role since the start of 2013 have been non-white			0
' miss @entity18 ’s suggestion that individuals are employed or treated differently according to their race is entirely untrue and without foundation			1
' he told the hearing that as soon as he returned from holiday in early september concerns were raised by @entity51 and her sister @entity136 about miss @entity18 ’s work			1
he said : ' i do not agree that i did not like @entity18 , my only concern was with her behaviour to our clients and whether she was capable of performing her role at @entity3			1
high standards : set up by the @entity145 and @entity146 in 1967 , @entity3 became the first @entity148 restaurant to be awarded three @entity4 stars in 1982 before it was taken over by @entity150 ( left ) ' despite additional training and close supervision i did not observe sufficient improvement in her performance			1
miss @entity18 displayed a lack of organisation in how she performed her duties , often mixing up guest ’s property and taking guests to the wrong tables			1
' due to her poor communication skills she was unable to undertake various administrative tasks or conduct telephone calls			0
i was very concerned by a failure on her part to be sufficiently personable with the guests			0
this is an extremely serious failure			0
' she was the first experience people had of @entity3 , and their last , so would be their lasting impression			0
she affected the feeling people got out of the restaurant , and this would damage the reputation of @entity3			2
' our clients pay a lot of money to come here			0
as one of only a handful of two @entity4 - starred restaurants in the world customers of @entity3 have the highest expectations , and we always aim to exceed those expectations			0
' the court also heard from @entity187 , who had been a receptionist at @entity3 before being promoted to mr @entity188 and mr @entity23 ’s @entity189			1
she said : ' i am a @entity191 national , born in @entity192 and of black @entity194 descent			0
i did the same job as the claimant			0
it was a hard job ; you had to be at your best all the time			0
there were high expectations but i made it though			0
' i was never treated differently by mr @entity23 or anyone else because of my colour			1
' @entity204 told the court she had hired miss @entity18 because she had some hospitality experience and had suggested from a trial shift she could do the job			1
she said : ' i explained to her her employment was on a one month trial basis and it depended on mr @entity23			1
despite comprehensive training , i became concerned about miss @entity18 's performance			1
' she was not able to perform tasks such as putting coats on hangers , or pulling chairs out and moving tables for customers			0
we would expect to see a genuine eagerness to serve customers in miss @entity18 's role , but that was not clear in her performance			1
consequences : the tribunal was told that at the restaurant , overseen by @entity150 ( pictured ) , ' reputation is of absolute importance ' ' we expect a receptionist to be there and be present , and give customers service before they ask for it			1
i told her there and then when she was making mistakes and told her how to put it right			0
' however there was no significant improvement in her performance			0
' both ms @entity204 and her sister said they had challenged @entity108 on numerous occasions about failures in her customer service and were consulted when mr @entity23 decided to sack her			1
however , miss @entity18 claims she was never told by either of the sisters her performance was less than exemplary			1
summing up her evidence , miss @entity18 told the tribunal : ' i believe mr @entity23 is racist and you are protecting him			1
' i believe 100 per cent that my dismissal was not due to my performance in any way			0
@entity51 and @entity256 have both worked with mr @entity23 for 13 years			2
will their evidence be objective ? i do n't think so			0
' no one ever gave me any reason why i was dismissed or any opportunity to appeal			2
' before mr @entity23 came things were fine , than he came and things started to change			2
i got on with the sisters before			0
they did not once challenge me on my performance			0
' i noticed as soon as i started there were no other black faces around			0
there was nothing wrong with my performance			0
i was sacked because i am black			0
' @entity270 , representing @entity3 , told the hearing that miss @entity18 simply did not meet the exceptional standards the restaurant demanded of employees			1
first set up by the @entity145 and @entity146 in 1967 , @entity3 became the first @entity148 restaurant to be awarded three @entity4 stars in 1982 , before it was taken over by @entity146 's son , @entity277 : the professionals judge @entity150 in 1991			1
the restaurant lost the third star in 1993			2
mr @entity270 said : ' the fact @entity3 is a high end fine dining restaurant can not be underestimated			2
one slip up on standards in such a prestigious and well known restaurant can result in significant consequences			2
reputation is of absolute importance to the restaurant			2
' it has not been suggested miss @entity18 was a woeful employee but the expectation at @entity3 far surpassed that of most run of the mill restaurants			1
' that she is unable to accept her performance may have been at fault shows her inability to look at things from an objective position			0
' the claimant said she did not see any other black people front of house after two days there			0
i claim she is overly sensitive to race and colour			2
she has not elaborated on her allegation that mr @entity23 treated her differently because of her colour or shown any actions of his that could be termed racist			2
i urge the tribunal to dismiss the claim			2
' the tribunal 's judgement found against @entity108			2
following the outcome mr @entity270 said : ' we were delighted , although not surprised , to receive the verdict we have always expected			0
' we were justified in taking the stance to defend this baseless allegation by ms @entity18 to full hearing , and have been completely vindicated on all counts			2
' the tribunal judge professor @entity322 said that " there is no evidence to support the suggestion that the restaurant has any policy or practice of discrimination in any form "			1

@entity1 tried to sue restaurant for race discrimination
claimed she was hired when general manager @entity23 was away
she says when he returned she was fired , and replaced by a white woman
restaurant says she was given a month 's trial and did not meet standards
@entity21 restaurant run by @entity16 is one of @entity148 's most exclusive
miss @entity18 's case later dismissed by tribunal
