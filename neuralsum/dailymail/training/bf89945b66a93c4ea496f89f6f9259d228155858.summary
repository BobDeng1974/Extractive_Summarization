weebles may seem like basic toys now , but in their day they used an impressive weight system based on the laws of physics to ‘ wobble but never fall down			2
’ to bring this childhood toy into the modern - day , a @entity6 firm has created a troop of @entity0 - style robotic cheerleaders who dance and move while balancing on a ball			1
and thanks to built - in gyroscopes and infrared sensors , the robots perform in perfect synchronicity - but never fall over			1
the @entity18 ( pictured ) were built by @entity6 - based @entity19			1
each robot balances - similar to @entity0 - and perform high - precision routines thanks to real - time position measurement technology the @entity23 were built by @entity19			1
instead of wheels , the cheerleading robots balance on a removable ball , which rolls in its housing to help the machines dance and move			1
they remain upright due to advanced gyro sensors , which incorporate inverted - pendulum control technology , to detect tilt angles			1
similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras , car navigation systems , and more recently , the electronic stability control systems that prevent cars from skidding			2

similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras , car navigation systems , and more recently , the electronic stability control ( @entity51 ) systems that prevent cars from skidding			2
each robot is equipped with four infrared sensors , and five ultrasonic microphones to detect surrounding objects , even in the dark			1

the robots will be showcased at the upcoming @entity72 2014 event 7 to 11 october and , based on the differing speeds of sound and light waves , this system determines the relative positions of the robots within a 172 square feet ( 16 metre square ) space			2
in collaboration with researchers from @entity81 at @entity82 , @entity18 has also developed an advanced group control technology that allows 10 robots to perform in synchronisation without colliding			0
each robot 's location is communicated using a wireless communication network , and controlled through a specially developed program			0
this same technology may someday be used to realise safer and more efficient vehicle and transportation systems , said the firm			0
‘ the @entity23 showcase the ability of electronics to enrich our lives , ’ said @entity94 , senior vice president and deputy director of @entity18 's @entity96			0
‘ we believe the wireless communication of sensor data could become a core infrastructure for the advanced integration of people and objects in smart societies			0
’ ‘ we developed the @entity23 to demonstrate our electronics technologies , ’ said @entity108 , senior manager of corporate communications			0
' our hope is that the @entity23 will inspire new discoveries by young innovators and put smiles on the faces of people worldwide			0
’ the @entity18 will be showcased at the upcoming @entity72 2014 scheduled from october 7 to 11 in @entity116			0
weebles are @entity119 toys that launched in 1971			0
a modern - day version is pictured			0
tipping the egg - shaped toy caused a weight in the base to lift off the ground			0
once released , gravitational force brought the weeble back into an upright position			0

the robots were built by @entity6 - based @entity19
each robot balances on top of a ball - similar to @entity0 toys
they can move in any direction and remain upright using sensors
using real - time position tracking , the robots also synchronise routines
infrared and ultrasonic sensors also help them dance in the dark
