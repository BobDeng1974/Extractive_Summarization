some 40 miles north of @entity0 , along a lonely two - lane road , stands a bedraggled , tin - sided building that hints at @entity4 ' past			1
@entity6 's multi-tiered wooden truss was decked out in white lights as @entity8 and @entity9 joined about 200 others for a monthly dance			2
the @entity12 live east of @entity13 and during their recent visit to central @entity15 decided to visit the old hall , where patrons paid about $ 20 to hear @entity18 and the @entity19			0

one , two , step ! in this december 2014 file photograph , girls dance to fiddle music at @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity4 get on down ! fiddlers perform at @entity32 in december			2
a preservation group says old @entity4 dance halls that for years served as important social centers in rural areas of the state are decaying and closing , with comparatively few still operating competition : patrons are seen listening during a fiddle festival at @entity32 @entity44 was built more than 100 years ago by @entity26 immigrants , who through the latter half of the 19th century comprised more than 5 percent of the state 's population , according to the @entity49			1
it 's one of an estimated 1,000 dance halls that sprung up around @entity4 in the 1800s , knitting together @entity26 , @entity53 , @entity54 and other immigrant communities			1
about 400 such halls still stand — many unused and decaying — but only two traditional @entity4 dance halls continue to operate on nearly a daily basis : @entity60 hall in @entity61 and @entity62 in @entity63			1
' the culture has shifted away from rural areas where most of the halls are , but what we see is that these cultures are foundational to what @entity70 are and what @entity4 is , ' said @entity73 , board president of @entity74			1
@entity76 ' group and others are working to preserve the state 's remaining dance halls , in part by creating an inventory so that the most distinctive ones become candidates for the @entity84			1
such designation would enable the halls to apply for grant assistance and protections against encroaching development			0
more practically , it would raise their profile among tourists and other travelers			0
' you can still go out on a saturday night and experience an authentic dance hall like you could 100 years ago and that 's something that really defines our culture here in @entity4 , ' @entity76 said			1
some dance halls also are architecturally unique , according to @entity76			1
the @entity102 west of @entity103 is a 12 - sided hall built in 1902 by @entity26 immigrants that features an elaborate wooden truss rising up to a cupola			1
at one time there were about 40 such ' round halls ' in the state , @entity76 said , but now just half that number exist			2
cool refreshments : the twin sisters @entity32 offers a number of beers , including @entity116 , @entity117 , and @entity4 - based @entity118 swing your partner round and round : a pair of dancers are seen at @entity124 in @entity33 , @entity4 corner entertainment : musicians @entity126 , center , and @entity129 , second from right , play outside of the dance hall in december @entity131 is president of a nonprofit association that operates the @entity124			2
it 's believed @entity134 , not far from @entity6 , has hosted at least a monthly dance since the 1880s			2
it costs about $ 16,000 a year for volunteers to maintain the building			0
' on a good year we break even , ' @entity131 said			0
the association is seeking an @entity143 designation as a charitable organization that would allow it to apply for state grants and other money , which would prove valuable in addressing expensive repairs like the nearly $ 20,000 needed to replace the roof , she said			0
@entity134 , founded by @entity26 immigrants , for years served as a vital community center , @entity131 said , and it 's important ' to reacquaint and refamiliarize people with this heritage			1
' ' we 're really working to bring people back , ' she said			0
' i think it 's a unique type of entertainment , also			0
' from about 1870 into the 1920s , @entity161 immigrants in @entity4 built hundreds of these halls			1
they largely served as meeting places for agricultural groups , rifle clubs and mutual benefit societies			1
over time , @entity76 said , they also became important social centers that on many evenings hosted popular dances			0
the popularity of the halls waned as @entity4 ' population shifted to the cities			2
in 1900 , 83 percent of the @entity4 population lived in rural areas ; 50 years later that percentage had fallen to 37 percent , and continues to decline			0
nowadays , a couple hundred remaining halls may host an event or two each year , but only a few dozen are used at least on a monthly basis , @entity76 said			2
when @entity184 bought @entity6 with his wife @entity185 in 1995 , business did n't look so promising			0
one weekend he laid out $ 700 for a band only to have one couple show			0
while still not a money - maker , @entity6 's monthly dances , along with wedding receptions and birthday parties , help the @entity192 break even			0
' @entity4 dance halls are becoming a very good investment because there are fewer and fewer of them , ' @entity184 said			1
big dipper : visitors dance to live music by @entity201 's @entity200 at @entity124 @entity202 : @entity203 's @entity200 performs as members of the audience dance leaving for the night : a patron in a cowboy hat is seen leaving the twin sisters @entity32			0
