by @entity0 sinking a simple putt may have won him the @entity2 – but was there a greater driving force behind @entity6 ’s triumph ? a budding romance , perhaps ? the victory – and spectacular return to form – meant the 25 - year - old golf star became the third youngest player to win three major championships			1
it all coincides with his blossoming friendship with @entity17 lingerie model @entity16			1
meanwhile @entity6 ’s ex-fiancee , @entity39 tennis star @entity38 , 24 , seems to be thriving on being a single woman after winning the @entity42 on sunday – her first title of the year			1
@entity6 and @entity16 , 25 , certainly seem to be getting closer			1
he missed a practice session before the @entity2 when he learnt that she had been involved in a car crash last weekend			1
her @entity47 flipped six times before crashing into the central reservation on the @entity50 in @entity51 when she was driving from @entity53 to @entity54			0
she suffered only minor bruising and a bump to her head			0
after the crash , @entity6 said : ‘ if anyone is involved in a car crash you are glad to see they are ok but yeah , obviously , it was a pretty scary incident			1
’ the golfer , who split from @entity38 in may after the couple sent out their wedding invitations , has been reluctant to answer questions about any potential new romance			1
but after he was spotted getting close to @entity16 in a @entity71 bar earlier this month , he rediscovered the kind of golfing form which propelled him to the top of the world rankings two years ago			1
@entity16 is a model , actress and singer who regularly appears on @entity17 television			1
she has previously described @entity6 as a ‘ lovely guy ’ , although she too has been coy about the nature of their relationship			1
family affair : @entity6 was joined by his mum @entity85 and dad @entity86 after claiming victory on the @entity88 beautiful people : @entity6 won his first @entity2 title not long after his rumoured romance started			2
coincidence ? ‘ the bottom line with me and @entity94 is we have mutual friends who introduced us and we ’ve been in each other ’s company , ’ she said			2
when asked if the golfer was her type she replied : ‘ i do n’t really have a type , to be honest with you			0
’ @entity16 said her ideal man would be ‘ a bit of a cheeky chappie who makes me laugh ... a guy with a twinkle in his eye ’			2
she added : ‘ for me it ’s not about looks			0
it ’s about the person			0
i think whoever i end up with i will be friends with first			0
‘ the important thing is having somebody with ambition and drive who is hard - working			2
that for me is a massive turn - on			2
’ the model did not attend the @entity2 at the @entity123 , in @entity124 , the @entity88 , despite speculation that she might make an appearance			1
she is thought to be in @entity129			0
all the same @entity6 punched the air with delight , then hugged his tearful mother @entity85 after sinking a simple putt to clinch the @entity25 – and a cheque for £ 975,000 – by two shots last night			2
describing his win , the @entity136 told the @entity138 : ‘ it feels incredible			0
there were a few guys making runs at me and i just needed to stay focused			0
‘ to win three legs of the grand slam at 25 is a pretty big achievement			0
’ he added : ‘ this is the first major my mum has been to that i ’ve won , so mum , this one ’s for you			0
‘ i just ca n’t wait to get back and defend this thing at @entity150 next year			0
’ @entity152 star : @entity16 romantic link : @entity16 just a friend ? @entity16 poses helping hand : was @entity16 the woman behind @entity6 's @entity2 success at @entity123 ?			1
