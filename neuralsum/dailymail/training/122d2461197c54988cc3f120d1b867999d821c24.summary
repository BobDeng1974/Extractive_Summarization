last week a grandmother was bitten in an unprovoked attack while pushing her baby grandson in a pram			1
@entity27 was among almost sixty people who needed hospital treatment this year after being bitten by one of the monkeys			1
a government led campaign , titled get our monkeys back to @entity36 , has since been launched to teach people not to feed the iconic primates			1
