by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 8:09 pm on 24th february 2012 celebrity chef and @entity5 personality @entity3 says that some people ‘ were kinda mean ’ about her diagnosis , after she publically revealed she has type - 2 diabetes			1
the queen of @entity11 cuisine drew ire from many in the health and culinary worlds when she announced that nearly three years before , she had been diagnosed with the disease			1
but all the while , she was promoting highly caloric and indulgent dishes , and appeared to hold her announcement until she had a paying endorsement			0
however , she calls the decision ‘ the way of the world ’ and ‘ the @entity31 way			0
’ @entity3 said she received much criticism from those around her			1
‘ i think a few people who have access to a tv camera and ink kind of wanted to hate on me for coming down with something , ’ she told @entity25 , adding that she ’s simply shrugged it off			1
@entity3 , now 65 , revealed to the @entity40 ’s @entity39 last month that she has been struggling with the disease for more than two and a half years			1
spotted last month chowing down on a cheeseburger , @entity3 vows to eat healthier , but says it would be impossible to cut out all the butter and bacon from her famously indulgent recipes			1
love of food : @entity3 has said the one food she could not live without is butter ‘ i am who i am , ’ she told @entity25 , ‘ but what i will be doing is offering up lighter versions of my recipes			1
’ @entity3 added that she ’s giving a portion of the remuneration she recieves for endorsing the diabetes medicine to the @entity63			1
she told the today show that she has ‘ broad shoulders ’ to deal with people ’s negative comments and says her long life has been ‘ a blessing			1
’ type 2 diabetes is a long - term condition caused by too much glucose , a type of sugar , in the blood			0
it is often associated with obesity			0
in those with the condition , the body is unable to break down glucose into energy as there is either not enough insulin to move the glucose , or because the insulin that is there does not work properly			0
the symptoms , such as tiredness and weight loss , can be controlled by eating a healthy diet and monitoring the blood glucose level			0
insulin medication , usually in the form of tablets , also controls the condition			0
around 25 million in the @entity31 have diabetes , with around 90 per cent having type 2			0
‘ i feel like @entity99 has given me a blessing , because my mother and daddy died very young , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m so proud that i lived long enough … to deal with something like this			0
’ the condition , linked to obesity , is a result of genetic factors and lifestyle choices			0
it is a result of the body not producing enough insulin or failing to use it efficiently , allowing excess sugar to build up in the blood			0
it can be managed by making lifestyle changes , such as exercising more and lowering blood sugars by altering the diet			0
it might come as little surprise that the condition has affected a chef whose signature dishes include bacon , egg and a burger between a doughnut			2
and in an interview with the @entity40 last year , the mother - of - two revealed she could never live without butter or her deep - fat fryer			0
but speaking about her diagnosis , the ' queen of @entity11 cuisine ' said people should take her recipes with a pinch of salt			1
' i 've always encouraged moderation , ' she said			0
' people see me cooking all these wonderful , @entity11 , fattening recipes ... it 's for entertainment			1
people have to be responsible			2
' speaking with @entity145 , @entity3 revealed how she told @entity146 to exercise the same sort of responsibility			1
signature dish : one of @entity3 's recipes is a @entity152 's @entity151 that features doughnuts in place of buns , bacon , a beef burger and a fried egg ' like i told @entity146 , " honey , i 'm your cook , not your doctor , " ' she said			1
' you have to be responsible			0
' when asked if her high - fat recipes can lead to diabetes , she said : ' that is part of the puzzle			2
' she added that there are other factors , including genetics , lifestyle , stress and age			2
' when your signature dish is hamburger in between a doughnut , and you 've been cheerfully selling this stuff knowing all along that you 've got type - 2 diabetes , it 's bad taste if nothing else			2
' - @entity185 to deal with the condition , she is ' making lifestyle adjustments , including lightened - up versions of her favourite recipes '			2
although it was rumoured @entity3 had the condition in april 2010 , last week was the first time she confirmed it			1
in 2010 , @entity3 earned just under $ 10 million from her television shows , recipe books , endorsements , retail sales and speaking fees , based on figures by @entity201			1
it suggests she could have earned around $ 30 million in the time since she was diagnosed			2
some of @entity3 's peers have questioned her judgement in keeping her own diagnosis quiet			1
fellow chef @entity185 , who is often outspoken on other cooking show celebrities , told @entity207 : ' when your signature dish is hamburger in between a doughnut , and you 've been cheerfully selling this stuff knowing all along that you 've got type - 2 diabetes , it 's bad taste if nothing else			2
