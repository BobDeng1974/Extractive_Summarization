' mr @entity11 , who was in a ' jolly ' mood , was walking in the street when he was first spoken to by another officer , pc @entity43			2
' he had n't done anything wrong , he was sort of jay walking i suppose , but it 's not a road where many cars are moving , ' said mr @entity24			0
mr @entity11 told @entity51 : ' there 's no need to be cheeky officer , i pay your wages			1
