by @entity0 for @entity1 rangers are once again flirting with financial meltdown – after the board admitted that they ’ll be unable to meet the demands of creditors unless a new £ 4million share issue succeeds			1
despite repeated official denials of any imminent threat of a second administration , the club lodged an open offer with the @entity13 on thursday , inviting existing shareholders to buy new shares at 20 pence each			1
and the club warned that , unless they raise at least £ 3million , the offer will not proceed – adding : ‘ should this occur , the @entity16 will be unable to pay its creditors as they fall due and the future of the @entity16 will be uncertain ; the directors will immediately have to seek emergency financing which may or may not be available			1

in a sign of how deep the crisis runs , the official statement to shareholders , outlining grand plans to raise up to £ 30million in the next three years , revealed that the club needed this fundraising exercise to help repay the £ 1.5million emergency loan taken out earlier this year			1
the statement read : ‘ on 23 february 2014 , the @entity16 announced that it had entered into two secured short term credit facilities for an aggregate amount of up to £ 1.5million			2
' these credit facilities are due for repayment on 1 september 2014 and the @entity49 is in discussions with the providers in relation to their repayment , part of which will come from the proceeds of the @entity56			0
‘ the @entity49 has developed and approved a strategic plan as part of the @entity59 to re-build and re-establish the @entity60 , to return it to the top of the domestic game within three seasons , and to thereafter be competitive in @entity65 competition			0
this will require continued investment in the playing squad over the next three years and beyond to drive on - field success			0
‘ in order to achieve this , the @entity16 will need to raise capital over the next three years			0
it expects to raise between £ 20 million and £ 30 million			2
@entity73 is an important planned part of this fund raising strategy and will provide the club with working capital and part of the repayment to @entity79 and @entity80 of the £ 1.5million drawn down from the credit facilities provided by them to the @entity16			1
