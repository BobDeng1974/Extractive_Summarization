as @entity1 prepares for his third @entity3 season , he finds himself being mentioned in same breath as @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
and just to increase the hype , @entity10 ’ past meets the present at @entity13 as the @entity14 face the @entity15			1
it is @entity1 ’s lot to endure constant comparisons with @entity5			2
following in famous footsteps : @entity1 has had constant comparisons with @entity5 throughout his @entity3 career after all , both are the offspring of @entity3 quarterbacks , @entity23 runners - up and were taken by the @entity14 as the first overall draft pick			1
‘ if you are a fan of the @entity3 i am sure the storyline is intriguing , ’ @entity1 says			2
‘ i know from my perspective i do n’t have to worry about @entity5 , i have to worry about the @entity15 defense and it is a darn good one			1
i am sure it ’s a fun storyline for the fans and media to get around			0
’ as @entity1 prepares to take his career to the next level , he can reflect on a successful sophomore season			0
on the way to winning the @entity40 , the @entity14 inflicted a first defeat on @entity5 ’s @entity15 and found a way to outscore eventual champions @entity44			1
in the post-season , he orchestrated the second biggest play - off comeback in @entity3 history against the @entity48 , but threw seven interceptions in two games			1
it was another seemingly evergreen quarterback in @entity6 who ended the @entity14 ’ season and @entity1 would watch fellow 2012 draft classmate @entity53 helping @entity44 to stampede the @entity15 in february ’s @entity54			1
does he fear a backlash following the one - sided rout ? ‘ i am not too worried about what their motivation is to come out and play well			0
i think any professional team is going in to come out and do their best to try to win , i am sure they are not happy about losing the @entity54 but they are a great team still and i am sure they will play very hard			2
’ on the rise : @entity1 has 22 victories under his belt in his first two @entity3 seasons with that in mind , what has luck been addressing to help him and the @entity14 make the next leap ? ’ a big focus this offseason has been understanding situational football better			1
third downs in the red zone in particular and figuring out how to get better in the red zone			0
‘ we need more touchdowns , ca n’t settle for field goal and definitely ca n’t turn the ball over – and how to convert third downs at a higher success rate			0
offensively if we can do those i think we will be able to take the next step			0
‘ i know as quarterback a big part of that is understanding the situation and understanding how the defense change or adapt and what we need to do to be successful			0
’ the last time the @entity14 faced the @entity15 , @entity93 was inspired , taking two sacks and a forced fumble			1
but he is suspended for four games after violating the @entity3 ’s substance abuse policy			2
but the @entity15 are missing key players too : both receiver @entity99 and @entity101 kicker @entity100 are serving four - game bans			2
and another hurdle for the @entity14 to overcome is the racket generated by @entity15 's fanatical fans			1
‘ we have had the speakers cranked up in practice to mimic the crowd noise every day			0
it is great preparation for how to handle communication			0
how you hand - check and audible at the line of scrimmage			0
‘ it will be a challenge but we will be prepared to handle that and as a player it is fun to play in a hostile environment , there is a little bit of a buzz in the air			0
’ and you suspect that buzz will be deafening if @entity1 gets the better of @entity5 again .			2

luck led the @entity14 to victory over @entity5 's @entity15 last season
the teams meet again at @entity13 in the 2014 @entity3 season *curtain* - *raiser*
the @entity14 are the defending @entity40 champions , while @entity15 were humbled by @entity44 in the @entity54
