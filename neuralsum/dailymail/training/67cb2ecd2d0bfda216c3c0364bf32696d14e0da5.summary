by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 did n't appear to be feeling the weight of expectation as the @entity5 and his team - mates prepared for their crucial derby clash			0
and city manager @entity9 underlined the confidence coursing @entity2 by claiming that his team ‘ expect ’ to win the @entity13 derby on tuesday night			1
for the first time in the modern era , @entity2 go to @entity16 as favourites with @entity9 ’s team 12 points ahead of their neighbours with two games in hand			1
’ he added : ‘ not because @entity16 have had a difficult season we are going to go there and win , but if we play a good game tomorrow we will have a good chance to win it			1
’ however , @entity9 played down @entity2 ’s tag as favourites and insisted that maintaining his club ’s title challenge is more important than securing bragging rights over their neighbours			1
he added : ‘ we know it ’s a derby , of course , but for our target we must add three points			0
we do n’t just need to win tomorrow and lose the next game			2
we need to be consistent from now until the end of the season			2
‘ i know we must go game by game			0
we do n’t know how many points we must add from now until the end of the season			2
it is important to try to win tomorrow and then after @entity56 on saturday , we will see how many points we need			2
‘ that is why for our team all the games have the same importance because they have three points , but a derby has a special importance because we know the fans enjoy winning against @entity16			1
‘ the players are very motivated to try and win the title			2
it has been a very close @entity68 from the beginning of the season and until the last match it will be the same way			0
‘ one of the positive things of being eliminated from other competitions is that we are just focusing on the @entity68			0
we do n’t have problem physically or mentally , we are just trying to fight for the title			0
roll up , roll up : @entity2 's stars are the picture of focus as the ball is put into the box chilling : @entity83 ( left ) , @entity27 and @entity84 warm down indoors at @entity86 ‘ but i do n’t think we are favourites in any game			0
that is why football is the most popular sport because you never know who will win			0
there are so many things that can change a score that you do n’t know about			0
we are in a good moment			0
tomorrow we are playing against a big team in their own stadium so i do n’t think we are favourites			0
’ @entity9 ’s first derby ended in a thumping 4 - 1 win at the @entity101 in september that added to the problems @entity23 has encountered as sir @entity104 ’s successor			1
however , the @entity2 boss warned that @entity16 ’s progress to the @entity108 quarter - finals proves that they are still a force to be reckoned with			1
@entity110 on : @entity2 's stars look relaxed on exercise bikes before the big match main men : playmaker @entity114 ( left ) and @entity115 look up for the mammoth clash at @entity16 ‘ it will be a very difficult game , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ maybe @entity16 have a difficult season but they are a very good team , one of the two @entity122 teams that stays in @entity108 so we must make sure we have a very good game if we want to win			1
‘ it is not my duty to analyse what @entity23 has done in his season at @entity16			1
i think that everyone know it was very difficult for him to replace sir @entity104 but i do n’t analyse what he is doing			0
’ out in the sunshine : @entity133 ( left ) , @entity134 and @entity114 head outdoors for training pumped : @entity137 ( right ) changes shirts as @entity139 returns to @entity2 's defence city skipper @entity139 will return from suspension to lead his side out at @entity13 and @entity144 is available again after missing saturday ’s 5 - 0 win over @entity146 through illness			2
however , as expected , @entity148 and @entity28 have been ruled out through injury .			1

@entity9 confirms @entity148 and @entity28 are out
city boss aims to win and *admits* @entity23 has had ' difficult season '
@entity155 denies that @entity156 are favourites against @entity16
