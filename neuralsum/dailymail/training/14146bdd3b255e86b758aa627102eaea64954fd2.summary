published : 06:05 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 10:06 est , 7 october 2013 skimpily clad young women sway in towering heels , with little more than a ripped t - shirt and shorts to protect them from the october evening			2
overly refreshed young men are helped along the streets by bleary eyed friends , while others are bent double , and wretching in the streets			2
these were the scenes in the early hours of this morning in @entity11 as the latest @entity13 event hit the city			1
dubbed @entity16 's most debauched student pub crawl , the night certainly lived up to its name			1
hundreds of students took to the streets of @entity11 last night to join one of @entity16 's biggest student pub crawls the @entity13 event , held this weekend in @entity11 , certainly did n't disappoint the many freshers who joined the crawl across the city young women dressed in small shorts and ripped t - shirts end the night in a sober fashion as they walk home a girl in a ripped event t - shirt cradles the head of her friend as she crouches on the floor next to a takeaway chicken shop the night looks to have proven too much for one reveler , as he leans over , apparently overcome with nausea however , by the usual standards of the event - which promoters claim will give students ' the best night of their lives ' - the night in @entity11 appeared somewhat tamer than previous events			1
while previous fancy dress themes have included ' pimps and @entity49 ' and ' @entity51 nurses and dirty doctors ' , this year 's circus theme lent itself to a slightly more @entity54 friendly outfit			0
the suspenders , stockings and basques of previous years were replaced in large by jean shorts , trainers and t - shirts			0
while it may have descended into a drunken haze for some , this excitable bunch of friends instead end the night with a bite to eat the night is somewhat tamer than previous events , and even the dress code appears to have been tailored to better tastes , with suspenders and basques swapped for tights , shorts and t - shirts young women rest against bollards and sit on the floor as they end the evening a young man picks up his friend while another cheers him on outside a city centre pub weary youngsters forget the chill and pick a spot on the floor to sit amorous couples were still seen canoodling in the streets , some sliding to the cold ground for a seat , and weary party - goers flocked noisily to kebab and chicken shops to soak up the booze with a takeaway			1
the excitement looked to have proven too much for one young man , as he clutches on to a wall , overcome with nausea			0
the @entity13 organisers have repeatedly come under fire for promoting excessive binge drinking as students are encouraged to go from one bar to the next to consume copious amounts of alcohol			1
some students pick a spot on the edge of the road to eat their post evening snack in the past , police have had to draft in extra man power during the event in the past , the nights have ended in controversy			2
but this year 's event in @entity11 seemed have passed without major incident some revelers appear to have opted for water as they chat after the event a young woman speaks to her friend who has decided to take a rest on the pavement next to a parked car in the past , the nights have ended in controversy			1
in 2009 , 19 - year - old student @entity127 desecrated a poppy wreath in @entity11 and was later ordered to carry out 250 hours of community service and pay Â£ 185 cost after admitting outraging public decency			2
following a carnage event held the same year , police said they were looking into the possibility of charging the organisers for the cost of the extra police needed to be drafted in to man the streets			0
police in @entity140 claimed the event cost them thousands of pounds			0
in 2010 a court heard how a carnage pub crawl operator punched unconscious a resident who voiced concerns about noise levels at one of their events			0
the @entity150 has contacted @entity13 for comment .			0

@entity16 's biggest student night @entity13 was held in @entity11 last night
has caused storm of controversy in past by ' encouraging binge drinking '
drunken *teenagers* in ripped shirts were helped to walk by friends
hundreds attended event - which was tamer than those in past
