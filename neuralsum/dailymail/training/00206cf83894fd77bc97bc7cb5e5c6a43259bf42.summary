by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 14:06 est , 4 march 2013 @entity1 , 48 , ballooned to 31 stone after he began comfort eating in his thirties a father who lost 13 stone after gastric bypass surgery has spoken of his misery of being left with two stone of excess skin hanging from his stomach			1
@entity1 , 48 , ballooned to 31 stone after he began comfort eating in his thirties			1
his weight has since plummeted to 18 stone after gastric bypass surgery - but he is unable to move properly , sleep on his back or swim due the huge apron of excess skin that comes to his knees			1
mr @entity1 , who also has excess skin on his arms and thighs , told @entity26 's @entity25 : ' i feel like i 've traded one problem for another - it 's like being a prisoner in my own body			1
' he is now desperate for an @entity34 operation to get the excess skin removed , which he describes as ' like a hanging skirt '			1
despite being active in his twenties , playing rugby and swimming , the weight piled on his thirties			0
' it was a psychological thing - i had a few bad relationships and turned to booze and comfort eating , ' he said			1
' over the years i got bigger and bigger and my weight got out of control			0
' after years of depression and snacking on fish and chips , kebabs and fried breakfasts , his weight hit 31st 9lb			0
he said : ' even then , my skin was hanging from my belly like a skirt because i was so big			2
' my belly was on my knees - i could n't get a pair of trousers on , only @entity63 jogging bottoms , and even then i had to wear braces to keep them up			2
' mr @entity1 ( pictured here with sister @entity66 ) lost 13 stone after gastic bypass surgery			1
he told @entity69 's @entity25 he had been left with 2 stone of excess skin around his stomach the crunch point came when his doctor told him if he did n't lose weight , he would be dead by the age of 55			1
too fat for a gastric band , he first underwent a gastric balloon procedure in february last year to make his stomach feel full			2
uncomfortable : the 2 stone of excess skin means mr @entity1 struggles with the most basic of tasks , such as walking and sleeping then in october , he underwent gastric bypass surgery			1
this is where part of the digestive system is removed so the patient can only absorb around 50 per cent of the calories he consumed			0
despite losing a staggering 13 stone in total , his success has turned to agony			0
although he has lost the fat , his skin still sags to his knees			2
people who lose weight quickly , such as those who 've had weight loss surgery , are particularly prone to excess skin			1
mr @entity1 also struggles with the most basic of tasks , such as walking and sleeping			2
he addded : ' i ca n’t sleep on my back because of the pressure on my belly , so i have to lie on my side			0
if i want to turn , i have to lift the skin			0
' the excess skin also means he ca n't go swimming , as the excess skin hangs from the bottom of his trunks			1
he must also tuck it down one leg of his jogging bottoms in order to get dressed			0
he also suffers from sores and fungal infections and is the butt of cruel jibes in the street			0
' it would be nice to have a relationship - i have been on my own for 11 years			0
' this @entity25 's resident doctor @entity123 , said : ' skin is elastic , but it will stretch so much			0
' this means people who have lost huge amounts of weight can be left with massive folds of loose skin - and we are seeing more and more of these cases			2
' cosmetic surgery will remove the skin folds that @entity1 needs , but it will be quite intensive surgery			1
it also costs at least £ 6,000 to have it done privately			0
' there are no national guidelines as to who can get a tummy tuck on the @entity34			0
doctors have to make a strong medical case to get the op on the @entity34 , such as the patient suffering recurrent skin infections and severe restrictions in daily living			0
' excess skin is extremely common after weight loss surgery , explains @entity150 , a plastic surgeon who works privately and at @entity151 and @entity152			1
‘ this excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body , ’ he says			1
factors that affect how much skin is left after a dramatic weight loss include age , how quickly the weight was lost ( gastric bands are slower than bypasses , for example ) , and , for women , the number of children she has had			2
‘ after extreme weight loss , many patients develop an “ apron ” of skin around the abdomen , and loose skin under the arms , chest and inner thighs , ’ explains mr @entity150			2
‘ it can all be very uncomfortable and upsetting			0
’ this excess skin can cause a range of medical problems , too			1
one of the most common is intertrigo — a bacterial , fungal , or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry			1
patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise			0
excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo bariatric ( weight loss ) surgery			1
mr @entity150 says : ‘ sadly , there are some patients who do not seem to have been prepared for this situation beforehand , and post-weight loss can be a very disappointing and psychologically damaging time for them			0
some do question why they had the surgery in the first place			0
