whenever @entity1 ’s exit from @entity2 back into the arms of @entity4 has started to look like a possibility in recent years there has always been a minority who have dared to ask : ‘ he ’s nearly 30 now , would they still want him ? ’ now he 's turned 30 , the age that for so long marked the watershed between a player ’s prime and his decline , and yet there are no signs of any slowing down			1
he was due to take time off from the daily round of 3,000 sit - ups to celebrate with friends and family at his @entity2 home in the luxury complex of ‘ @entity24 ’ in the @entity26 capital on wednesday night			1
@entity1 celebrates his 30th birthday on thursday and @entity2 posted this montage @entity1 poses in his new spring / summer @entity1 underwear range as the @entity2 star celebrates turning 30 @entity1 shares his february 5 birthday with other notable names from the football world			1

@entity47 - @entity46 striker , born 1984			0
@entity50 - @entity49 and @entity51 striker , born 1990			0
@entity44 and @entity53 striker , born 1992			0
@entity54 - @entity4 winger , born 1995 the trappings of superstardom are always in evidence at these events			0
last year he hired the magician @entity61 to do a few tricks for his son @entity63			0
this year dj @entity65 had been hired to provide the music and if @entity69 quarterback @entity68 had turned up to get pass the parcel started , no one would have been surprised			0
@entity1 has reached levels of global superstardom that would have been difficult to foresee when he first arrived at @entity73 in 2003			1
‘ he is the greatest sportsman ever , ’ says his agent @entity74 , who this week reminded everyone that his number one client ’s buy - out clause is set at £ 1billion			1
yet while some players allow the fame and fortune to diminish their hunger for on - the - field success , @entity1 seems as intent on setting records and winning trophies at 30 as he was at 20 when he was just two years into that @entity4 career			1
@entity1 has been in excellent form for @entity2 this season , helping them to the top of the league @entity1 gets stuck in during training with his @entity2 team - mates @entity4 @entity95 : 2006 – 07 , 2007 – 08 , 2008 – 09 @entity96 : 2003 – 04 @entity97 : 2005 – 06 , 2008 – 09 @entity98 : 2007 @entity99 : 2007 – 08 @entity100 : 2008 @entity2 @entity101 : 2011 – 12 @entity102 : 2010 – 11 , 2013 – 14 @entity103 : 2012 @entity99 : 2013 – 14 @entity104 : 2014 @entity100 : 2014 when he picked up his third @entity107 in january there was an : ‘ i ’m coming for you ’ message to @entity110 who still has one more @entity112 award			1
this year ’s challenge is to become one of the first group of players to retain the @entity99			2
and he is slowly climbing the list of all - time goalscorers at @entity2 where @entity120 awaits him at the summit			2
‘ @entity1 will play at the highest level until he is 40 ’ @entity74 told @entity26 radio recently			1
‘ he will still be scoring 30 goals with his head a season when he is 39 years old			0
the way he manages his life , what he eats and how he rests is an example to all			0
’ it is part of @entity74 ’ job to praise his player but the predictions for the future were intriguingly specific			2
the mention of 30 ‘ headed ’ goals perhaps comes from an appreciation that while eventually the blistering pace might fade other qualities will not			0
he started out as a winger , then became a winger who could play at centre - forward			0
he could comfortably end up as just an out and out centre - forward , and a formidable one at that			0
the finisher ’s instinct , the precision from penalties and the talent for spectacular free - kicks will all be unaffected by the advancing years			0
@entity1 scored against city rivals @entity155 in the @entity99 final last season @entity1 got his hands on the @entity99 for the second time while at @entity2 almost as impressive as the drive to go on improving has been the way he has handled the transition from a star at @entity4 to a global icon at @entity2			1
last year he became the first sportsman to reach 100million fans on his @entity168 page as well as over 31m @entity170 followers			0
back in 2003 when he turned up for his first training session at @entity4 , @entity172 was still a year away from launching @entity168 , when the fan mail came back then , it came in the post			0
but in @entity74 ’ care @entity1 has proved himself the perfect modern footballer off the pitch as well as on it			1
@entity1 celebrates winning the @entity107 for the second successive year @entity1 also won the @entity181 award in 2014 a young ronaldo growing up in @entity183 and playing for his first club , @entity184 the move to @entity2 took the image to another level			1
the signs were there right from the start when he registered the trademark @entity1 before he had even started wearing the no 7 shirt at the @entity193			2
when @entity120 left at the end of @entity1 ’s first season the shirt number finally fitted the brand			2
@entity2 has embraced @entity1 the male model as much as @entity1 the footballer			1
a one hundred - foot - high billboard poster of him modelling his latest line of @entity1 underpants in the city ’s municipal hall two years ago was proof of that			2
@entity1 joined @entity4 in 2003 at the same time as @entity208 midfielder @entity207 @entity1 had a good relationship with @entity4 manager sir @entity210 when he first arrived at @entity4 , @entity1 had a reputation of going to ground too easily @entity1 replaced @entity212 at @entity4 but at @entity2 he has replaced the former @entity38 captain off the pitch as @entity2 ’s most marketable star			1
in a deal that runs to 2020 , adidas pay @entity2 £ 31m a year for the privilege of seeing @entity220 ’s biggest client wear the adidas logo every weekend			2
@entity1 himself earns around £ 5m a year from @entity220			2
he has more than tripled his income from sponsors since being in @entity26 , earning around £ 20m a year from brands as diverse as @entity226 , @entity227 , and @entity228			2
@entity2 president @entity230 used to say that he would sell the stadium before selling @entity212 , the sentiment is the same towards @entity1			1
that might explain the insistence that @entity235 ’s transfer to the club in 2013 was for less than the club paid for @entity1			0
@entity1 quickly changed his ways at @entity73 and became one of the biggest stars at the club @entity1 helped @entity4 win the @entity96 in 2004 when they beat @entity242 in @entity243 @entity1 won three @entity95 titles in his time at @entity4 @entity1 also helped @entity246 win the @entity99 by beating @entity247 in @entity248 in 2008 and when too many people started to believe that @entity235 was indeed @entity2 ’s most expensive - ever acquisition , @entity2 made sure that @entity1 was the highest earner in history by putting his pay up to £ 15m a year net with a new five - year deal just a month after @entity235 ’s signing			1
the deal which works out at around £ 280,000 a week is some pay rise especially when looking back to 2013 he was angling for a new contract at @entity4 that would see him move to £ 120,000 a week			0
many back then were asking : ‘ is he really worth it ? ’ just as at 30 some might ask : ‘ can he still do it ? ’ @entity230 and @entity74 would no doubt answer : ‘ yes he is ’ and ‘ yes he can ’ .			1

@entity1 won the @entity107 and is regarded as the world 's best
he has won league titles and the @entity99 in @entity38 and @entity26
@entity1 's agent @entity74 believes he will play until he is 40
