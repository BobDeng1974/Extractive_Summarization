whether as munitionettes , frontline nurses or land girls , the contribution made by women during @entity2 was a vital one			0
now a new book has revealed that it was a stylish one too - and led to wardrobe innovations , among them trench coats and trousers , that remain popular today			1
but in 1914 , both were a long way off with women trussed up in corsets , strapped into awkward hobble skirts and burdened with huge wide - brimmed hats , regardless of class or political inclinations			1
patriotic : @entity21 such as this @entity22 helped popularise military styles such as trench coats by the time armistice day arrived on the 11th november 1918 , the nation 's wardrobes were almost unrecognisable , with knee - length skirts , billowing harem pants and tailored uniforms taking centre stage			1
this , argues fashion historian @entity33 , author of @entity34 : tales from the @entity36 , is testament to the resilience and adaptability of the women serving on the @entity40 as well as an important record of changing circumstances			1
' the changing fashion over the four years of war is arguably one of the most significant reflectors of the changes happening in women 's lives , ' she explains			0
' clothes reveal an immense amount about status , about culture , about austerity or prosperity			0
the military aspect of @entity2 ca n't be properly understood without first understanding the culture			0
early years : a glamorous walking suit from 1915 ( left ) and right , the ' directoire ' look popular as war began enter the trouser : trousers were first worn by women in the mines , as this coke backer shows ' that was what sent so many men and women to serve their countries on the frontline and @entity40			1
even uniforms are a fashion of sorts			0
' @entity40 , with all these domestic details , is every bit as much a part of history as the mud and horror of the trenches			0
' although rationing of the sort seen during the @entity86 was n't introduced until february 1918 , clothes became increasingly expensive as the war ground on and shortages began to bite			2
as a result , most became more streamlined , with the elaborate ' directoire ' style of 1914 giving way to simpler garments and comfortable working wear such as trousers			1
' narrow skirts , wide hats and a high waist were all the rage at the time war broke out , ' explains @entity33			1
' it was the @entity100 version of regency or @entity103 fashion with lots of whites , creams and pastels			0
' fashionable women struggled along in hobble skirts , despite the very public demands of suffragettes for greater social and political freedom			1
working women , as ever , wore what they 'd got			0
' by 1916 , the demands of working life in @entity118 's factories , hospitals and arsenals had forced a sea change in the nation 's wardrobes , with shorter , @entity125 skirts that aped military uniform becoming the ensemble of choice for patriots			1
' the new uniforms for women doing war work required shorter hemlines on @entity125 skirts and looser fitting jackets and these were copied by civilians as a popular and patriotic style , ' says @entity33			1
the new shorter silhouette also reflected another new reality : with increasing amounts of textiles required to clothe frontline troops , getting hold of material was becoming an expensive business			2
elegant : evening gowns also suffered from material shortages , becoming significantly shorter by 1916 practical : @entity150 such as these ones embraced a looser , more practical style and shorter skirts ' the voracious need for uniforms for the troops meant that wool , in particular , for civilian clothes could be hard to come by , ' adds @entity33			1
' women were incredibly innovative about finding ways to rework old clothes to suit new styles and to make new clothes last longer - just like the make - do - and - mend of @entity86			0
' also , as women became involved in war work , they had to shrug off pre-war notions about chaperonage and the shorter , looser clothes reflected this energy and effort			2
' not everyone was impressed by the new look , however , with more conservative types raising a haughty eyebrow at the increasing popularity of trousers			2
others found them uncomfortable , among them journalist @entity180 who disguised herself as a soldier in order to get to the frontline			1
sea change : by the end of the war , early examples of the 1920s ' flapper ' style had become hugely popular @entity191 : some women , @entity193 among them , even began to wear their husband 's uniforms ' i was left alone to struggle with unknown buttons , braces , and the division sum of how to make a big body go into a small size of trousers , ' she furiously wrote from the @entity40			2
' eventually i got in by a series of jumps , jerks , and general tightening up ! ' but many more , among them the poet and author @entity206 , found them liberating			0
' i had just got clothes like the women - on - the - land were wearing , and in the unaccustomed freedom of breeches and gaiters i went into wild spirits , ' she wrote in 1917			1
' i ran , i shouted , i jumped , i climbed , vaulted over gates , i felt like a schoolboy let out on a holiday			0
' ' breeches were essential wear for railway engine cleaners , motorbike dispatch riders and workers in the new 1917 @entity226 , ' comments @entity33			2
' some women struggled to get into them			0
some hated being teased while wearing them in public			2
some adored the new freedom of movement they brought , and hated having to go back into skirts and petticoats once the war was over			1
' symbolically , trousers , which had seemed so splendid and patriotic when needed , were unacceptable after the war , once women were being hustled back into their domestic roles			0
' but try though they might , the genie of independence for women had been unleashed from its bottle and in the post-war world of the 1920s , there was no putting it back			0
' the war accelerated social change and the ' flapper ' look of the 1920s reflected this , ' says @entity33			0
' having tasted freedom in their clothes , women were reluctant to be so confined again			0
' @entity34 : tales from the @entity36 by @entity33 , Â£ 25 , is published by @entity260			1

the ' directoire ' look with hobble skirts and huge hats was stylish in 1914
by 1918 , it had been *replaced* with shorter skirts , trousers and trench coats
not everyone liked it , among them *pioneering* journalist @entity180
others embraced it and *revelled* in the freedom of wearing breeches
