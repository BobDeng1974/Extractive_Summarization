an angry father has taught his disgruntled teenage daughter a very public lesson in respecting one ’s elders by shooting her laptop on camera and then publishing the video on her @entity9 page			1
@entity10 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , made the video after his 15 - year - old daughter @entity14 had apparently written a @entity9 post complaining about all of the chores she has to do at home			1
she was also moaning about how difficult her parents made her life			1
but when it worker mr @entity10 found the post he decided grounding her would not be punishment enough and made the video			1
‘ this right here is my .45 , ’ he says , moving a pistol into the frame			1
he cocks the weapon and shoots nine rounds into the laptop			1
the video entitled ‘ @entity50 ’ is dedicated to his rebellious daughter			1
it ’s also aimed at ‘ all her friends on @entity9 who thought that her little rebellious post was cute , and for all you parents out there who think your , you know , kids do n’t post bad things on @entity9 ’			1
he begins by reading out his daughter ’s post from a computer print - out , explaining ‘ since you want to hide it from everyone , i ’m going to share it with everybody ’			2
aim : mr @entity10 gets out his pistol to shoot the laptop , left , which he has placed in the dirt and grass - before he starts to fire at it , right , shooting nine bullets including one from @entity14 's mother mr @entity10 mocks his daughter for thinking her parents would not be able to see the post because of her @entity9 privacy settings , ignoring the fact that he works in it for a living			1
' that right there is your laptop			2
this right here is my .45 ' @entity10 in the post , @entity14 says she should be paid for the chores she does around the home and attacks her parents for overworking her			1
mr @entity10 laughs at this suggestion , pointing out what an easy life she gets in comparison to what he had to endure growing up			1
she moans about waking up at 5am and go to bed at 10pm			2
then after about seven minutes addressing the camera to berate @entity14 , he stands up and blows holes through the laptop			1
irreparable : he shoots nine bullets into the computer , which he tells @entity14 she will have to pay for as well winding up : ' i hope you 've enjoyed your little fiasco ' says mr @entity10 as he sits back down in front of the camera he rounds off by saying : ' oh yeah and after that comment you made about your mom , your mom told me to be sure i put one in there for her			1
so … that one 's from her			2
' ' maybe a few kids can take something away from this , ’ mr @entity10 writes in the video description			1
‘ if you ’re so disrespectful to your parents and yourself as to post this kind of thing on @entity9 , you ’re deserving of some tough love			1
today , my daughter is getting a dose of tough love			1
’ he said he found her hidden @entity9 post while upgrading her computer			2
he completes his lesson by saying : ‘ you can have a new laptop when you buy a new laptop and when you pay me back the $ 130 for the software i spent on yours			2
‘ i hope you ’ve enjoyed your little fiasco on @entity9			0
i hope it was worth all this			0
' the video has been watched around 1.5million times since it was posted just two days ago			2
mr @entity10 has since written on @entity9 that the attention has helped him and his daughter ' deal with it ' and insisted @entity14 is fine , saying they both laughed about the video going viral			1
but he admitted : ' i ’ll agree that was n’t a good example of me as a father			2
i had been reading that post again and again for about an hour , sometimes in tears , other times so mad my hands were shaking			0
' i was trying very hard to be civil in my message , ' mr @entity10 said , reported @entity152			1
' i slipped in that and said a word i should n’t have			0
i deserve a little backlash for that , no doubt			0
' to my parents , i 'm not your damn slave			2
it 's not my responsibility to clean up your s * * t. we have a cleaning lady for a reason			0
her name is @entity168 , not @entity14			1
if you want coffee , get off your ass and get it yourself			0
if you want a garden , shovel the fertiliser yourself , do n't sit back on your ass and watch me do it			0
if you walk in the house and get mud all over the floor that i just cleaned , be my guest , but clean it up after you are done getting s * * t everywhere			0
i 'm tired of picking up after you			0
you tell me at least once a day that i need to get a job			0
you could just pay me for all the s * * t that i do around the house			0
every day when i get home from school , i have to do dishes , clean the counter tops , all the floors , make all the beds , do the laundry and get the trash			0
i 'm not even going to mention all the work i do around your clinic			0
and if i do n't do all that every day , i get grounded			0
do you know how hard it is to keep up with chores and schoolwork ? it 's freaking crazy			2
i go to sleep at 10 o'clock every night because i am too tired to stay up any longer and do anything else			0
i have to get up at five in the morning , to get ready for school			0
on the weekends , i have to sleep with my door locked so my little brother wo n't come get me up at six			0
i 'm tired of this bulls * * t. next time i have to pour a cup of coffee , i 'm going to flip s * * t. i have no idea how i have a life			0
i 'm going to hate to see the day when you get too old to wipe your ass and you call me , asking for help			0
i wo n't be there			0
signed , your pissed kid , @entity14 see video here			1
