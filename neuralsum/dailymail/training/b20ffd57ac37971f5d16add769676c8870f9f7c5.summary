by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 19:51 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 19:51 est , 12 june 2013 @entity3 crops could give pigs diseases , after scientists claimed those fed the so - called @entity8 food had inflamed stomachs and heavier uteruses			1
the research is significant because the digestive system and organs of pigs are similar to those of humans , who eat the pork from the animals			1
a group of @entity21 ’s biggest supermarkets recently ended a ban on the feeding of @entity3 crops to pigs and other animals on farms in this country			2
@entity3 - fed female pigs had on average a 25 per cent heavier uterus than @entity32 - fed pigs - a sign of disease the trial involved 168 newly - weaned pigs in a commercial piggery in @entity38 meat , milk and eggs from these animals is not labelled as having come from animals fed on @entity3 crops			1
the latest study will embarrass the government , which supports @entity3 crops and food , based on assurances that they have been proven safe for humans and the environment			2
however , the research suggests this can not be taken for granted			0
it was led by dr @entity54 , associate professor in health and the environment at @entity57 , @entity58			0
she said @entity3 - fed female pigs had on average a 25 per cent heavier uterus than @entity32 - fed females , which is a possible indicator of disease			1
also , severe inflammation in stomachs was markedly higher in pigs on a @entity3 diet			2
calling the results ‘ striking ’ , she added : ‘ we found these results in farm conditions , not in a laboratory , but with the benefit of strict scientific controls			2
we need to investigate if people are also getting digestive problems from eating @entity3 crops			0
’ the trial involved 168 newly weaned pigs fed either @entity3 soya and corn , or an equivalent @entity32 diet			1
the pigs were reared under identical housing and feeding conditions , while they were slaughtered once they were over five months of age , which is normal for commercial production			0
they were autopsied by qualified veterinarians who worked ‘ blind ’ – they were not informed which pigs were fed on the @entity3 diet and which were not			1
but professor @entity93 , of @entity94 , @entity95 , said : ‘ there were no differences in growth and mortality rates and pigs appeared in similar health			0
’ a @entity103 professor , @entity102 , said : ‘ the conclusions do n’t stand up to statistical scrutiny			0
’ @entity110 - based farmer and crop and livestock advisor @entity106 , one of the coordinators of the study , said : ‘ for as long as @entity3 crops have been in the feed supply , we have seen increasing digestive and reproductive problems in animals			1
now it is scientifically documented			0
environment minister @entity119 dismissed scepticism of @entity3 as ' complete nonsense ' ‘ in some cases , animals eating @entity3 crops are very aggressive			1
this is not surprising , given the scale of stomach irritation and inflammation now documented			0
’ the @entity127 said : ‘ this study was authored by anti-biotech campaigners			0
hundreds of independent studies found no difference between animals fed @entity3 or @entity32 diets			1
’ the news comes as @entity119 , secretary of state for environment , food and rural affairs , claims opposition to @entity3 food should be cast aside in the interests of the economy and our ability to feed the world			2
mr @entity119 has dismissed scepticism of @entity3 as ‘ complete nonsense ’			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the world ’s population is set to hit nine billion by 2050 , and we must increase food production , minimise waste and boost competition			0
we must not ignore technologies , including @entity3 , that can meet the challenge			0

research significant because pigs organs are similar to humans
@entity38 trial found @entity3 - fed female pigs had on average a 25 per cent heavier uterus than @entity32 - fed females , which is a possible indicator of disease
environment minister has dismissed @entity3 scepticism as ‘ complete nonsense ’
