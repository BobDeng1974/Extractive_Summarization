@entity1 customers who may have been wondering about the ingredients in the fast - food chain 's beef now have their answer			1
the national chain of @entity8 - inspired restaurants , owned by @entity9 ! brands , has launched a new page on its official website explaining the contents of the 12 per cent of @entity1 's beef that is not actually beef			1
the company concedes that the ingredients in the 12 per cent ' signature recipe ' have weird names - perfect for tongue twisters			1
' the meat of the matter : @entity1 recently launched a new page on its official website explaining the contents of the 12per cent of its beef that is not really beef ( pictured , the @entity28 tacos ) coming clean : the fast - food giant has admitted a few years ago that only 88 per cent of its beef is beef , leaving 12 per cent made up of flavoring and coloring agents but the page goes on to say that all the items , many of which sound like they belong in a chemistry kit , ' are completely safe and approved by the @entity39			1
' ‘ they 're common ingredients also found in food items at your grocery store , ’ the company states			0

they 're also commonly found in cheeses , coffee drinks and desserts @entity91 to add brighter flavor caramel color and cocoa @entity94 color is caramelized sugar			1
@entity97 does n't add any flavor , but helps keep brown color in beef lactic @entity102 acid occurs in almost all living things , and used to manage the acidity to get the right flavor source : @entity1 ‘ each ingredient helps make our @entity108 taste great			1

’ according to @entity1 , they start each of the 2billion tacos served up every year with @entity125 - inspected quality beef , then add water to keep it moist , toss in ' @entity8 spies and flavors , ' plus oats , yeast , citric acid and ' other ingredients ' to ensure the consistency of their ' seasoned beef			1
' the company , however , insists on the site that the @entity1 beef does not contain any fillers			2
in response to speculations that @entity1 uses low - quality beef in its menu items , the explainer page indicates that the fast - food giant purchases 300million pounds of ' 100 per cent premium real beef , period			2
' so what is in @entity1 's signature recipe , you ask ? one of the components is torula yeast - a type of yeast that infuses plain beef a more savory falvor , according to the restaurant chain			1
another ingredient is a naturally occurring sugar that goes by the not overly appetising name ' trehalose			0
' no serving of @entity1 beef is complete without an artificial ' black pepper flavor , ' a winning combination of caramel color and cocoa powder to make the meat appear more beefy , and modified corn starch			1

@entity1 's unexpected move toward greater transparency comes at a time when the company is trying to take on the @entity201 ’s juggernaut by offering its own breakfast menu			0
@entity1 was forced to change its marketing practices and come clean about the ingredients in its lineup of @entity8 favorites back in 2011 in response to a class - action lawsuit claiming that the chain 's seasoned beef did not contain enough beef to justify the usage of that term .			2

@entity1 says 88 per cent of its beef is actually beef , and the other 12 per cent is ' signature recipe '
ingredients in signature recipe include caramel color , cocoa , maltodextrin , modified corn starch and torula yeast
