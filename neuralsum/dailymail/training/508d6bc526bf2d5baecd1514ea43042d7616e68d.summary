student @entity0 , who was cleared of the brutal sex murder of @entity2 , has revealed how he had sex with former girlfriend @entity4 the first night they met			1
@entity6 , 28 , was convicted alongside @entity7 in 2009 of killing miss @entity8 , but the pair were freed last october after their convictions were overturned due to a lack of evidence			1
now @entity0 has been pictured enjoying a party lifestyle and promoting a new book which is set to shed light on his relationship with @entity7 before the death of @entity8 , a 21 - year - old from @entity20			1
looking almost unrecognisable , @entity0 the ex-boyfriend of @entity4 smiles for the camera at the @entity24 festival in @entity25 early this week innocent : @entity27 citizen @entity4 , left , and her then - boyfriend @entity0 , of @entity29 , outside the rented house where 21 - year - old @entity32 student @entity2 was found dead ( file photo ) in the book he reveals how he ended up sleeping with @entity7 on the very day they met			1
the revelations in his book , which he wrote about the case with @entity32 author @entity39 , is expected to earn him more than Â£ 1million when it is released next week in the @entity27			2
describing his first intimate night together with @entity7 , 25 , he said : ' i showed @entity4 around and invited her to plop down on the bed while i loaded a film on my computer			1
' of course , by the time i settled in next to her , all thoughts of the movie were quickly forgotten and we pulled each other 's clothes off before the opening credits finished rolling			0
' when i woke up the next morning , @entity4 still had her arms wrapped tightly around me			2
i remember feeling safe and warm in a way i had n't since i was a little kid			0
' we related in a sweet , almost childlike way , maybe because we did n't share a native language			0
' in honour bound : my journey to @entity59 , the bespectacled computer studies graduate reveals his true feelings for the 25 - year - old blonde @entity27 , who he met just a week before tragic @entity2 was found semi naked and with her throat slashed in the bedroom of her house			1
attending the massive 50,000 person open air desert festival , @entity0 looks a different person from the troubled soul who appeared in court last year the annual counter-culture festival relies on a system of barter - trade and not money to purchase goods and services while at the event @entity0 stands with a man dressed as a leopard with the mountains of the @entity85 behind him @entity0 seemed to really get into the spirit of things at the @entity24 festival the murder made headlines around the world and the pair were famously photographed kissing and cuddling outside the scene of the crime - and in the ensuing trial @entity7 was portrayed as man - hungry and her boyfriend as an obedient puppy			1
@entity0 also revealed how he became jealous when just days into his relationship with @entity7 he discovered her on @entity102 chatting to her former boyfriend @entity103			1
he says : ' i asked who he was			0
right away , she explained that she , like @entity2 , had left behind a boyfriend when she came to @entity29			2
his name was @entity103 , known as @entity103 , and they were still in regular contact			0
' in fact , they chatted or e-mailed almost every day			0
@entity103 was spending his junior year in @entity113 , and given the distance , it had n't made sense for them to stay together as a couple			0
' i could tell just by looking at @entity4 that she was still attached to him			2
even though we 'd only known each other a few days , i had fallen for her - and it hurt			0
' he also describes the moment he met @entity7 again for the first time after they were sensationally cleared of the murder last year due to a lack of evidence - after spending four years in jail and being convicted in 2009			2
murder charges : @entity0 , left , and @entity4 , right , are pictured arriving for a hearing in @entity133 's court , in 2009 ; in @entity0 's book , he maintains his innocence but says he and his then - girlfriend behaved oddly the pair were filmed kissing , cuddling and stroking each other outside as the police were investigating the murder @entity0 said : ' i was n't just nervous about setting eyes on her again			1
i felt i was suffering from some sort of associative disorder , in which it became difficult for me to focus on my genuine and continuing fondness for @entity4 without being overwhelmed by an instinctive , involuntary revulsion at everything the courts and the media had thrown at her			0
' two different @entity154 - the real one , and the distorted , she - devil version i had read about and seen on television nonstop for four years seemed somehow blurred in my unconscious mind			0
' @entity7 and @entity0 were held by police just five days after the 2007 murder because of their odd behaviour - initially they could not remember clearly what they were doing as they had been smoking marijuana the night of the killing and detectives watched in amazement as the pair kissed and cuddled in front of @entity2 's grief stricken friends while they waited to be interviewed			1
@entity7 performed cartwheels in the police station and sat on @entity0 's lap - and they were also later filmed buying lingerie , the @entity27 promising her boyfriend she would wear it later while they had ' wild sex			1
' brutal murder : @entity2 was killed in her apartment on november 1 , 2007 in his book @entity0 admits their behaviour was ' odd ' but at the same time he hits out at the sloppy police investigation which was so crucial in clearing them after experts revealed at the appeal evidence was unreliable as it had been poorly handled and was contaminated			1
he admitted they also had no real alibi as the couple were smoking marijuana the night of the murder and they only had ' each other ' to explain what they were doing the night of the killing			0
at their first trial which ended in december 2009 @entity7 was jailed for 26 years and @entity0 for 25 years after they were found guilty of murder and sexual assault			1
a third man @entity206 drifter @entity2 , 25 , has also been convicted and he was initially given 30 years but this was reduced to 16 on appeal			2
@entity7 herself has kept a low profile at her home in @entity213 since the murder but like @entity0 she has also signed a multi million dollar book deal and it is due out next year			1
@entity0 is in the @entity27 ahead of next week 's book launch and he is not expected to return to @entity29 until next month following a tv appearance on @entity219			1
anxious moments : @entity0 waits in @entity133 's @entity221 before hearing that he won his appeal against his murder conviction on october 3 , 2011 in @entity29 testifying : @entity0 testified during a session of @entity7 's appeal trial in @entity133 's courthouse on june 27 , 2011 his father @entity229 , speaking from his home near @entity228 , said : ' @entity0 has been in @entity27 for the last few weeks finishing off the final details on the book and preparing for the presentation next week			1
i think it will take place in @entity236			0
' for the moment it wo n't be coming out in @entity29 and there are no immediate plans for the book to be translated into @entity29			0
i have n't read the book yet and i only know a few of the details			0
' i ca n't say for certain if @entity0 really did write that he and @entity4 were smoking marijuana in the house the night @entity2 was killed - to me it 's a minor matter but on the other hand it does prove that @entity0 and @entity4 were doing something else while the poor girl was murdered			1
capture : @entity7 , pictured in 2010 being escorted out of court by @entity29 law enforcement officials release : @entity7 , pictured right at @entity255 's airport , gave an emotional press conference once she got back home in @entity259 , left , a day after she was acquitted of murder in october 2011 ' once the presentation is over and he has given his tv interview he will return to @entity29 and resume his university studies in @entity264			2
as far as i know he has n't meet up with @entity4 while he has been in the @entity27 but they do speak regularly			0
' the most important thing is that we are waiting hopefully for the decision of the @entity29 @entity270 in march when they will both be finally cleared and this nightmare will be over			0
' @entity0 has spent most of the last month in the @entity27 and his @entity102 page shows him in @entity274 where he worked with the book 's @entity32 author @entity39 and also most recently in @entity236			2
his @entity102 profile shows him as being friends with @entity4 's sister @entity279 and her step sister @entity280 as well as her step mum @entity281			0
under his profile he describes himself as ' honest , calm , positive young man but an incurable daydreamer			0
