by @entity0 published : 10:31 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 11:08 est , 21 september 2012 a woman who had twins with a long - time friend is locked in a complicated custody battle after he told her he was gay , had only used her as a surrogate and was keeping the children with his partner			1
@entity10 , 48 , met businessman @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 in 2005 and , as they were both in their 40s , not married and without families , they decided to have children together			1
' i 've always wanted to be a mom , ' @entity10 told @entity21			1
' that 's my biggest dream and it always has been			0
he came across as a very kind man , a very good man , and i trusted him			0
' the pair , who had planned to co-parent the children , decided to use in - vitro fertilization with anonymous donor eggs for the pregnancy			1
@entity11 paid for the procedure , the lawsuit claims			2
he has temporary custody when she found out earlier this year that , after two rounds of @entity43 , she was pregnant with twins , ' i was absolutely thrilled , ' close said			1
' i always wanted twins			0
' but feelings of joy were quickly replaced with betrayal when she gave birth to a boy and a girl in july - and @entity11 told her he was taking the children			1
' the social worker came to me and said we had a surrogate situation , ' she said			0
' [ the worker ] claimed i was a surrogate for him and his domestic partner that i did n't even know he had			2
' he became so enraged when he saw close breastfeeding the children in hospital , he took out a restraining order against her , she said			2
betrayal : after the birth , @entity11 ( left ) told close he was gay and the babies would be brought up by him and his partner , @entity67 ( right )			1
the children are currently staying with @entity67 battle : @entity10 said that even though she used donor eggs to get pregnant there was never a surrogate contract @entity10 's case is complicated as a doctor advised her to use donor eggs due to her age , so she is not the children 's biological mother			1
@entity78 claims she was a surrogate , but typically , a contract must be agreed and the mother and father are spelled out if this is the case			0
however , attorneys said @entity13 law does not exclude other arrangements for surrogates , which is an issue the courts may take up here			0
in normal surrogate cases , the intended mother 's eggs are used inside a different woman			2
even though the intended mother does not carry the children , she is legally the ' mother ' due to an agreement			0
in this case , an anonymous donor was used and the child would have no legal mother , as is required			2
an issue that could also work against @entity11 , who wants to bring up the children with his gay partner , is that the intended parents have to be married for a surrogacy to be a valid contract in @entity13			1
same - sex marriage is not recognised by the state			0
traditional surrogacy - where parents use a surrogate woman 's eggs and body to carry a child - is not recognised in @entity13			1
@entity11 filed a lawsuit against close in august , demanding he be named as the father as she was simply a surrogate and had no rights			1
he has temporary custody of the children , and they are now living with @entity11 's partner , @entity67 - even though the father does not live there			1
@entity10 said she is only allowed to see her children for two hours a day on monday to friday , and claims the couple has placed cameras in the room to watch her as she holds her babies			1
' i only ever wanted to be a mom and ... after giving me my dream , he 's taking that away , ' she said , breaking down in tears			0
the courts will now determine what rights close has as she struggles to define in legal terms what it means to be a mother			2
' we 've alleged he duped @entity10 into have her children on the basis on him attempting to have her declared a surrogate once they were born , ' her attorney , @entity137 , said			1
he explained that , in @entity13 , the mother does not need to prove she is the parent but @entity11 must prove @entity10 was a surrogate			1
they never signed a contract or agreement , he said			0
' this was not a surrogacy , so it never occurred to me that i would ever need a written agreement , ' close told the @entity151			0
' if anything , i thought he would lose interest because i did n't expect him to be a very involved father			0
' @entity137 added : ' it 's our position that a woman who gives birth is the mother , unless there is a [ surrogate ] agreement			0
' if @entity11 had his way , the children would have no legal ' mother '			2
taking a stand : attorney @entity137 said @entity10 was duped and @entity11 must prove she was a surrogate in surrogate cases , the intended mother 's eggs are used and , while she does not carry the child , she is the ' mother ' because of the agreement			1
in @entity13 , it 's not the mother 's burden to prove she is the parent , @entity137 , said , so the onus is now on @entity11 to prove @entity10 was a surrogate			1
another issue that could work against @entity11 is that the intended parents have to be married for a surrogacy to be a valid contract in @entity13			2
same - sex marriage is not recognised by the state			0
' the father is arguing a very technical legal position , ' @entity181 , a professor at @entity182 , said			0
' but it 's one of those cases that you hope the judge will be able to look at more than just preliminary technical matters			0
' @entity11 's attorney , @entity190 , did not comment on the case			0
he and @entity10 will appear in court on monday			2
