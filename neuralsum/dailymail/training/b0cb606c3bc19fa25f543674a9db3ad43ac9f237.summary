by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was forced to apologise to @entity4 manager @entity3 and the @entity6 crowd after marring a match - winning performance with a show of petulance			1
@entity4 ’s @entity12 striker destroyed @entity13 with two first - half goals but spurned the chance of a hat - trick by blazing a 54th - minute penalty over the bar			1
when he was substituted soon after , he appeared to speak out of turn to @entity3 , who promptly brought him into line with a stern rebuke that stopped him in his tracks			1
‘ i want to apologise for my reaction , ’ he told @entity24			1
‘ it was just disappointment after missing the penalty , but i let myself down and the fans			1
i apologise if it caused anyone any offence			1
but it 's not about myself			1
it 's about the boys in the team			1
’ after revealing @entity2 had said sorry to his team - mates in the dressing room , @entity3 made it clear he had given his in - form frontrunner a reminder of how he expects @entity4 players to conduct themselves			1
click here to read @entity61 's verdict on the battle of the @entity64 bosses			1
‘ it was n’t a difficult decision to take him off at all , ’ he said			2
‘ he scored with two sublime finishes and was outstanding throughout			2
but i wanted to shore the game up , after we put so much effort in			2
it was time to make a change and balance the team up , and that ’s why @entity2 came off			1
‘ it was just frustration on his part , but there is no problem			2
he apologised to the group			2
i always say to the players that they must show respect to the club and that when the manager makes a decision like this , it ’s not because someone has played poorly			1
‘ sometimes it is tactical or down to injury , but you accept coming off and sit with the rest for the remainder of the game			2
if you want an explanation , you can knock on my door the next morning , and you will get an honest answer			2
you do n’t disrespect the club or its supporters			0
@entity2 was just disappointed because he was desperate to get on the scoresheet again			1
’ @entity101 took responsibility for @entity2 ’s penalty howler after handing spot - kick duties to him in the hope he would complete his hat - trick			1
‘ i told him to take the penalty , so i have to hold my hands up and take the blame for that , ’ said the @entity4 skipper			1
‘ i wanted him to experience what it feels like to score a hat - trick against @entity13 at @entity6			1
i ’ve experienced it , and i wanted him to			0
it 's a shame he missed it but he 'll just have to go and score against @entity118 now			1
howler : @entity2 ballooned his penalty over the crossbar when a goal would have secured a hat - trick @entity124 in his hands : the @entity127 forward was left in disbelief at his woeful penalty effort my responsibility : @entity101 insisted it was his decision for @entity2 to take the penalty ‘ but we 've got two world - class forwards , in @entity2 and @entity135 , and with them we have always got a chance			1
the aim all season has always been top four and we are very much in that now			0
‘ @entity2 was disappointed but he was absolutely world class and he destroyed @entity13 in the first half			1
the third goal killed @entity13 and knocked the stuffing out of them			1
’ @entity3 added that he hoped to make ‘ a major signing ’ before the window closes at the end of the week			1
@entity13 ’s injury worries worsened after @entity148 was taken off on a stretcher with suspected ankle ligament damage in the first half			0
‘ it looks like a ligament injury , ’ said manager @entity151			0
‘ we will assess it in the morning , but it does n’t look good			0
he twisted his ankle after colliding with @entity158 when @entity4 scored the first goal , and it has been put in a cast			1
’ @entity151 pulled no punches as he reflected on his side ’s shortcomings			0
‘ i was particularly disappointed with the first half , ’ he said			0
‘ there was a spell of 13 or 14 minutes where we lost the game through naivety			0
we were desperate to come here and be ourselves and give a performance that the fans could be extremely proud of , but we played a bit too much with our hearts at times			2
@entity4 wanted to hit us on the counter , and we should have used that to our advantage , but we did n’t			1
‘ we seemed focused only on trying to score , and , as a consequence , we left ourselves way too open			0
we have n’t done that all season , and it became a test of character in the second half after we let the game slip away from us			0
we looked out of sorts , and we gave the ball away far too cheaply			0
’ good night 's work : despite the flashpoint , @entity2 can take comfort from two goals in the @entity64 derby quite brilliant : @entity4 's third goal came from a wonderful @entity2 lob over @entity192 making his point : @entity2 celebrates his superb second goal in @entity4 's 4 - 0 win against @entity13 carved open : @entity196 ( 10 ) supplied the pass for @entity2 's first goal of the night brace : how @entity2 ( 15 ) got on the end of @entity202 's long ball to score @entity4 's third goal click here for more stats and analysis from @entity207 's brilliant @entity206 @entity3 insisted @entity4 are on course for a return to the @entity211 ’ @entity210 and denied he was dissatisfied with club bosses over their failure to deliver more signings this month			1
‘ i 'm delighted for the players and the supporters , because it was a brilliant team performance based on really good defensive organisation , he said			2
‘ we were clinical in front of goal and outstanding on the counter attack			2
‘ i think it was a message			0
we have shown all season we are going to be in contention for a @entity210 place , and this was further proof			0
‘ we have shown great spirit			0
we have structured the team so we are not reliant on any one player			0
‘ to get @entity2 and @entity135 into the same team is a bit of a risk because other players have to fill in			1
@entity237 , for instance , had to work his socks off , but i would rather take that risk because they give us so much of a threat			0
‘ i think all wins are important , but especially against your rivals			0
psychologically , it was a big win and one that can reinforce the confidence in the squad			2
‘ it puts us four points ahead of @entity13 now and we have to put the foot to the floor and go on from this			0
we had a real focus and concentration coming into the game			0
we knew it was massive , and to score four goals and defend like we did was an immense performance			2
on top of the world : @entity4 celebrate their derby demolition of @entity13 at @entity6 ‘ if anyone questioned whether @entity101 can play that deeper role , they got their answer			1
you have seen him in 32 derby games where he has been all action , but he was equally brilliant further back tonight			0
‘ he is such an unselfish guy and a real generous man			2
a local guy in the derby giving up a penalty like that is a mark of the man			1
‘ it is really special because of the nature of the game with two teams doing the city proud all season			0
i am more delighted for the supporters and the players			0
the fans can go away and have a beer and celebrate			0
‘ hopefully we can have a major signing before the window shuts , i think we will hopefully do something over the next couple of days			0
‘ it could n't be further from the truth that i am angry with the club			0
i came here to do a collective effort to turn around the fortunes of the club			0
the people here are very important to what we are doing and we want to do it together			0
