by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 will hold talks with @entity5 about becoming their next manager - and he could bring @entity8 legend @entity7 with him to @entity9			1
spurs have begun identifying candidates to replace current boss @entity11 , who is set to leave this summer			0
@entity2 is a favourite among the @entity5 hierarchy , and speaking on @entity17 tv on tuesday the @entity15 legend confirmed the @entity20 club ’s interest			1
@entity5 ’s intention to discuss the managerial role with @entity2 was made directly to @entity3 director of football @entity23			1
they have approached @entity3 , but that ’s it , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ @entity5 have let @entity3 know they would eventually talk to me when the season ’s finished			1
‘ after the last league game ( against @entity42 on saturday ) i ’ll think about it , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i ’ll talk to them and listen to what they have to say			0
i would like to add something to a club like @entity49 did at @entity50			1
‘ i see a perspective at @entity5 , just as @entity50 and @entity52 sometimes are , they are sleeping giants			1
’ @entity5 ’s interest in @entity2 brings up the sensational possibility of @entity7 joining his colleague in north @entity57			2
the 44 - year - old is currently @entity2 ’s assistant at the @entity60 , with the pair forming a strong working relationship ; winning three consecutive @entity32 titles together			2
hot seat : @entity5 boss @entity11 's current deal has him in charge until the end of the 2014 - 15 season success : @entity2 says @entity5 could be a ' sleeping giant ' of a club , like @entity50 and @entity52 influence : @entity2 believes he can emulate the kind of success @entity49 has had at @entity50 should he end up at @entity5 , it is understood @entity2 is keen on continuing his partnership with @entity7 but realises the delicate nature of his countryman ’s sitaution			1
@entity7 , who made 417 appearances for the @entity82 , is still revered in the red half of north @entity57 and even has a statue outside the @entity85			0
the former @entity15 forward still has huge affection for @entity8 , while members of the club ’s hierarchy have earmarked @entity7 as a possible future @entity82 boss			0
@entity91 ask : @entity7 's emotional and historical ties to @entity8 make it unlikely he 'll go to @entity5 club legend : a statue of @entity7 stands outside @entity8 's @entity85 and given his emotional ties with @entity8 , it seems highly unlikely @entity7 would agree to join bitter rivals @entity5			2
realising the special circumstances , it is believed @entity2 would look to bring @entity101 - who also works under him at @entity3 - with him to @entity5			1
@entity5 were non-committal with regards to @entity2 ’s claims , which have cast more doubt on @entity106 ’s position as head coach			2
@entity2 was last night installed as the new bookmakers favourite to land the @entity5 job			2
however , @entity111 manager @entity110 remains a strong contender according to @entity5 sources			0
contender : @entity111 boss @entity110 is also highly regarded within @entity5 ' hierarchy the @entity116 is well thought of within the corridors of power at @entity5 and , despite the approach for @entity2 , remains a challenger for the post			1
meanwhile , @entity5 legend @entity121 has ruled himself out of replacing @entity11 and also taken a dig at the current @entity5 boss			0
@entity11 identified @entity121 as one of the managers touting himself to take over at @entity9			0
return ? @entity121 has been linked with a comeback as the @entity5 manager but the former @entity129 boss said : ‘ i have seen that i am the favourite for this job , that job , virtually every job			0
that i am ready , that i am desperate to get back into management , that i am touting for this or that job			0
‘ but i am not			0
@entity11 must obviously feel under pressure to take what has happened and what has been in the public domain for some time now and choose to interpret that as me touting for his job			0
‘ the truth of the matter is vastly different , and i can imagine by naming me he is deflecting attention from himself , which is fair enough - managers do it all the time			0

@entity2 says @entity5 have ' made an approach ' via @entity3
the @entity17 led @entity3 to their fourth title in a row at the *weekend*
@entity2 says he will talk to @entity5 after final game of season on saturday
former @entity160 star hopes to emulate @entity50 's @entity49
