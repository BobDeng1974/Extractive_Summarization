by @entity0 published : 07:59 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 08:23 est , 20 april 2012 @entity2 expat businessman @entity1 , whose murder has caused political upheaval in @entity5 , left his wife and children in a financial situation so uncertain that a former business associate paid for their plane tickets to attend his @entity13 funeral			1
mr @entity1 left his family savings equivalent to a ‘ five digit ’ sum in @entity2 pounds , a family friend has revealed			1
police suspect he was the victim of a poisoning engineered by the wife of ousted @entity22 boss @entity21 , over a business dispute that turned personal			2
suspicions : police believe @entity26 , left , had businessman @entity1 , right , poisoned after he threatened to expose her plan to move millions of dollars abroad they suspect that the 41 - year - old @entity29 had been helping @entity21 ’s wife @entity26 , a former high - powered lawyer , move money offshore in return for a commission on the transaction			1
however the lack of funds left to his family raise the possibility that any financial dealings with @entity26 may not have yielded him windfall profits			1
the account marks the first time that details of @entity1 's financial affairs have emerged since he died in southwest @entity5 last november			2
family friends also revealed more details about the final few days leading up to his death			1
if such transactions did take place , and he made personal gains from it , @entity1 's widow , known to friends as @entity52 but who kept her maiden name @entity55 , has no knowledge of them , according to the friend 's account			1
questions remain : it is thought that mr @entity1 was killed in one of the mountain - top hotel 's £ 600 - a - night villas , but details of his demise are sketchy @entity55 , a native of @entity5 's northeastern city of @entity72 where @entity21 was mayor from 1993 to 2000 , and @entity1 's mother , @entity74 , and sister in @entity13 have turned down interview requests			2
‘ she does n't have a lot of bank savings , ’ the source said , requesting anonymity , adding that she had to make monthly mortgage repayments on a three - storey town house the family owns in suburban @entity82			1
when @entity1 bought the house a few years ago , similar homes in the gated compound sold for around 3 million yuan ( $ 476,900 ) , according to a local broker			2
today such houses sell for about 7 million yuan following a boom in @entity82 real estate			0
police believe @entity26 plotted to murder @entity1 after he demanded a larger - than - usual cut of a big transaction and threatened to expose her financial dealings if she refused , sources with knowledge of the investigation said			0
private : mr @entity1 's body was found at the three - star resort - the same hotel where mr @entity21 's wife , @entity26 , the prime suspect in his murder is said to have shown her power by getting the local police chief to subdue rowdy diners the scandal , which has brought down @entity21 , once considered a contender for a top national leadership post , is potentially the most divisive the @entity22 has faced in more than two decades			0
it was not clear whether @entity1 had other bank accounts his wife did not know about or owned assets overseas			0
if he did , his widow knew nothing of them , the family friend said			1
@entity1 , educated at @entity121 's elite @entity120 and a fluent @entity5 speaker , dressed well , drove a @entity123 and had friends in @entity2 's aristocratic circles			1
he once arranged a visit to @entity5 by @entity128 's granddaughter			0
one of @entity1 's ancestors was @entity2 's consul general in the northern port city of @entity132 from 1929 to 1935			1
his children went to an international school in @entity82 where the family paid attendance fees totalling more than $ 50,000 a year			2
but friends say his expatriate life , while comfortable , was not lavish			0
the chain - smoking @entity1 made his living as a mostly self - employed consultant to companies , including the @entity82 dealer of @entity143 , helping them resolve disputes and assisting with due diligence			0
his grey @entity123 was second - hand , with a license plate ‘ @entity148 ’			0
he requested and obtained the ‘ 007 ’ plate from @entity82 traffic authorities as he was a fan of @entity153 spy movies and classic sports cars , according to the family friend			1
family friends dismissed @entity2 media reports that @entity1 may have been a @entity2 spy			1
the reports were based on the part - time work @entity1 had done for @entity160 , a @entity2 - based private business consultancy founded by former @entity2 intelligence officers			1
another source close to the family scoffed at the idea , saying a real spy would hardly advertise the fact by driving around in a car with ‘ 007 ’ plates			2
‘ who would be so stupid as to carve 007 on his face if he were a real spy ? ’ this second source said			0
in 2006 , @entity1 advised the maker of @entity13 taxi cabs , which was looking to enter the @entity5 market			0
‘ from a company viewpoint , he was rock solid - good knowledge , very intelligent , a well - organised sort of guy , ’ said @entity176 , chief executive of cab maker @entity177 , which is 20 per cent owned by @entity5 car maker @entity178			0
@entity1 's widow flew to @entity13 with the couple 's children - aged 7 and 11 - last december to attend a memorial service after the @entity143 dealer in @entity82 paid for their plane tickets , the family friend said			1
@entity143 @entity82 declined to comment when reached by telephone			0
the 41 - year - old widow returned to @entity82 with her children after the church service			0
they did not suspect then that @entity1 had been murdered			0
in his last days , @entity1 did not appear stressed , family friends said			2
he attended the launch of a sports car club in @entity82 on november 11 and bought his daughter a birthday gift , something from @entity202 , the next day .			0
