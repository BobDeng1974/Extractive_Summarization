@entity2 's @entity1 hopes remain alive but a late @entity4 equaliser saw them leave @entity5 disappointed			0
they did , however , show resilience to recover from goalkeeper @entity9 's third - minute blunder as @entity10 scored his second in as many games before @entity13 scored the vital second just before half - time , only for @entity16 to nick an equaliser to secure a 2 - 2 draw at the death			2
@entity21 's @entity20 rates the players ' performances on wednesday			0
@entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity9 – 3 horrible error for the opening goal hardly mitigated by bouncy pitch			1
awful on crosses @entity28 – 5 one shot at goal following overlapping run but needed to be told to get back @entity32 – 5.5 troubled by @entity4 movement early on but won important headers and improved striker @entity10 scores @entity2 's first goal against @entity4 @entity36 – 4.5 poor clearance for the first goal and looked uncertain throughout in the air @entity40 – 5.5 better defensively at left - back but lost his man at corner for late equaliser @entity45 – 6 @entity46 on first game in three weeks and gave away fouls			1
but grew into game and source of probing long passes @entity9 's gaffe gifted the opening goal to @entity54 of @entity55 @entity56 – 5.5 few moments of note and struggled to impose himself in midfield until a late couple of clearing headers @entity13 – 7 great run , pointing @entity64 to where he was headed , and finish to edge @entity2 ahead @entity67 – 6.5 performed better in advanced role , where his sharp passing had more impact @entity72 produced another impressive display for @entity2 @entity72 – 7 terrific energy , always wanting to win back ball , and superb cross for @entity13 goal but costly miss in second half @entity10 – 7.5 generated own power for well - placed header			1
good pass in build - up to second too sub @entity85 ( for @entity64 ’ ) - 6 @entity2 boss @entity86 was left to rue a late slip in @entity5 manager @entity86 - 6 nearly got the win that was required but punished for failing to use substitutes to affect			0
referee @entity92 ( @entity93 ) - 6 fell for some @entity4 play - acting too easily and rather fussy @entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity94 5 ; @entity95 6.5 , @entity96 4 , @entity16 6 , @entity97 5.5 ; @entity98 6.5 , @entity99 7 ( @entity100 ' 5 ) ; @entity101 6 ( @entity102 72 ' 5.5 ) , @entity103 6.5 , @entity104 6.5 ; @entity54 7 ( @entity105 ' 5 )			0

@entity2 keeper @entity9 *awarded* just 3 after horrible mistake
*defenders* @entity36 ( 4.5 ) and @entity28 ( 5 ) also struggled
@entity10 top scored with 7.5 and *capped* *energetic* display with goal
