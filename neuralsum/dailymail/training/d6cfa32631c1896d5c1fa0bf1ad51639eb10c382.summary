the @entity1 public have ' fallen out of love ' with @entity3 and there will be no return to ' @entity3 ' , a frontrunner for the @entity8 leadership has claimed			1
energy secretary @entity9 said the best mr @entity3 could hope for at the next election is earning the ' respect ' of voters after five years of coalition government			1
the remarks come amid a slew of polls showing support for the @entity8 at chronic lows			2
but the party 's predicament did not appear to be of much concern to a host of delegates pictured bored and asleep at the conference in @entity25 today			1
a sleeping delegate at the @entity8 conference caught the mood of many activists in @entity25 today a number of party supporters were seen nodding off at the @entity32 on the banks of the @entity34 a @entity8 delegate texts in the audience during mp @entity38 speech , while another supporter appears to have dropped off a @entity8 delegate appeared keen to catch up on his sleep in a sparsely - populated auditorium this afternoon mr @entity9 's move to highlight the deputy prime minister 's dire personal ratings will be seen as fresh evidence of his own leadership ambitions			1
but mr @entity3 today appeared to anoint @entity8 treasury secretary @entity48 as the party ’s leader in waiting			1
mr @entity3 said he would not ‘ go on forever ’ as @entity8 leader – adding that not a ‘ @entity52 rabbit ’			1
he said : ‘ i think there are other things to do in life , and i 'm thankfully not one of those people who 's so obsessed with politics that i want to be in politics forever			1
but i would like to see the @entity8 in government after next may , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity60 said the problem with politics is you start popular but inexperienced and as you become better at your job you become less popular			0
i suppose that 's happened to us and to me			0
’ mr @entity3 added : ‘ i 'm 47 , i 've got three little kids , i 've got lots of interests outside politics and lots of friends outside politics			2
i 'm frankly too busy to do that			0
you should be dedicated to your job but not obsessive about it			0
’ the deputy pm also shrugged off speculation that mr @entity48 was angling for his job , saying it was not a ‘ sin ’ to be ambitious			0
‘ @entity48 is a fantastically close friend and colleague			0
i do n't see what 's wrong with ambition , ’ he said			0
an @entity85 survey for @entity86 today showed just 17 per cent of voters think mr @entity3 is doing a good job , down by eight points since june , while 59 per cent think he is doing badly			1
this gives him a dire net rating of -42 per cent , -35 per cent for @entity93 's @entity92 and only -7 per cent for @entity95 pm @entity94			2
a separate @entity97 poll for @entity98 last night showed 56 per cent of people think the @entity8 have become irrelevant , while just 26 per cent disagree			2
just 14 per cent trust mr @entity3 to keep the promises he makes while 63 per cent believe the @entity8 leader will break his pledges			1
some 44 per cent of adults believe it was a mistake for the party to go into @entity107 with the conservatives in 2010 and 42 per cent feel betrayed by mr @entity3			2
energy secretary @entity9 suggested mr @entity3 could hope for the ' respect ' of voters in 2015 most @entity8 dems are resigned to the fact that mr @entity3 will lead the party into the next election			1
but several senior figures are said already to be positioning for their own leadership bids , including mr @entity9 , treasury minister @entity48 and party president @entity116			1
in a damning assessment on his leader 's appeal , mr @entity9 told @entity98 's @entity121 : ' i do n't think we 're going to see the repeat of the last election where you in the media had what you called ' @entity3 ' when everyone fell in love with @entity3			1
' because we had to go into @entity107 with the @entity108 , that 's what people voted for , because we 've had to take some hard choices , because of the financial mess that @entity93 left us with , people have fallen out of love with @entity3 , that 's what the opinion polls show			1
' he went on : ' but i tell you what , i think nearer to the election when people look at what he 's delivered and what the @entity8 have delivered , he 'll get respect			2
i think we 'll move from the ' @entity3 ' of the last election to @entity3 - respect			0
' he deserves that respect			0
if you look at his record , how a really courageous @entity1 politician , taking on the @entity108 , delivering a stronger economy and a fairer society , focusing on the opportunities we want to give to all people			0
' i think @entity3 will win that respect and will win votes at the next election			0
' in a separate poll by @entity162 , just 7 per cent of people say they plan to vote @entity8 next year			2
of those , just a third - or 2.2 per cent of all voters - say they will definitely vote for mr @entity3 's party			2
overall , the @entity95 are ahead on 32 per cent - after their successful conference last week - with @entity93 on 30 per cent			0
deputy prime minister @entity3 will hope to revive the party 's support with set - piece pledges to cut tax in his speech tomorrow @entity8 minster @entity171 and the business secretary @entity172 appeared less - than enthused at the party 's conference in @entity25 today the @entity8 are languishing in fourth place in the polls - equal with the @entity177 , but behind ukp @entity178 are on 17 per cent , with the @entity177 on 7 per cent - the same as the @entity8			1
mr @entity3 yesterday played down his party 's struggles in the polls			1
he told @entity98 : ' i 've literally lost count of the times , with the greatest respect , that i 've been asked questions saying ' oh is n't it going to be a disaster ? are n't you going to be wiped out ? is n't it all going to be terrible ? ' and every time we confound the sceptics and i genuinely think we will do so next year			0
' i 'm not a soothsayer or a pollster so you 'll need to speak pollsters and soothsayers about what they think the future will hold			0
all i can tell you is what i believe , what our values are and the pride that i have in what we 've done over the last four and a half years			0
