the longboats are each individually crafted and allow you to experience the sea like the norse warriors of old			0
want to own a @entity3 ship ? now you can , thanks to a museum in @entity7 , which is building authentic longboats ( pictured ) for anyone who wants to purchase one			1
they cost up to £ 325,000 ( $ 545,000 ) and allow you to enjoy the same mode of transport used by the @entity23 1,000 years ago the ships are meticulously built to mimic those used by the @entity23 who inhabited @entity26 from about 700 to 1100 ad			1
@entity27 6 40 feet ( 12 meters ) long seven pairs of oars and sail € 250,000 - € 400,000 ( £ 200,000 - £ 325,000 and $ 340,000 - $ 545,000 ) the @entity31 33 feet ( 10 meters ) long six pairs of oars and sail € 113,000 - € 160,000 ( £ 90,000 - £ 130,000 and $ 150,000 - $ 220,000 ) the @entity34 21 feet ( 6.5 meters ) two pairs of oars and sail € 33,000 - € 53,000 ( £ 27,000 - £ 43,000 and $ 45,000 - $ 72,000 ) viking ships were fairly advanced for their time - they were swift and nimble , allowing for raids on coastal areas across western @entity41			1
the open decks sometimes supported crews of up to 60 men , ready to plunder various unsuspecting towns before moving on to another target			0
the replica ships are built in the museum ’s boatyard			2
according to the museum , the price depends on the production method requested			0
they say they can produce completely authentic longboats built in the same way @entity23 would have done over a millennium ago			1
this includes ‘ felling and preparing the timber from the forest , with tools that existed during the @entity3 area ’ they write on their website			0
for example , the saw was not even invented during the @entity3 times , meaning they had to build their ships through other methods			2
however , the museum admits they use a combination of modern and @entity3 tools to make the ships while still retaining the ‘ quality and appearance ’ of a ship from the @entity77			1
the boats are individually crafted using similar tools and methods employed by the vikings from 700 to 1100 ad			0
however , the museum admits that some modern tools are used in order to speed up the process slightly as , for example , the saw was not even invented in the time of the @entity23 viking longboats were swift ships that allowed warriors to quickly mount attacks against coastal towns and villages , plundering what they could and then moving onto the next target before local forces had time to react , making @entity23 adept pillagers of their era ‘ vikings are popular like never before , ’ said marketing director at @entity100 , reports the @entity102			1
‘ that ’s why we have no doubt that an authentic @entity3 ship online will fulfil a childhood dream for private persons and companies - whether it 's for a weekend cruise or a spectacular marketing statement			2
’ @entity100 is affiliated with the museum and committed to creating authentic items like this			0
' our philosophy is quite simple			0
why buy a plastic sword , when you can buy a hand crafted , authentic nordic sword for collectors or children – at the same price ? ' says the company on their site			0
the replica ships are built in the museum ¿ s boatyard			2
according to the museum , the price depends on the production method requested			0
they say they can produce completely authentic longboats built in the same way @entity23 would have done over a millennium ago now you can be a @entity3 too : included with each boat are replica oars and sails similar to what the @entity23 would have used , enabling shoppers to relive the adventures of these norse seafarers			1
