by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:04 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 07:18 est , 31 january 2013 she was wrapped up against the cold in a faux fur coat … but it ’s a blue @entity6 shirt that most of @entity7 will forever associate with @entity8			1
her revelations that @entity11 government minister @entity10 made love to her in his club strip kept the nation amused for months			1
never mind that her infamous claim , along with the toe - sucking and spanking , were made up			1
the damage was done and mr @entity10 eventually quit the @entity19			2
two decades later : @entity8 , 51 , famed former mistress of ex-tory minister @entity10 , pictured outside a restaurant in west @entity21 recently ( left ) and at the time of the affair ( right ) two decades on , the 51 - year - old former soft porn actress whose affair with the married ‘ minister for fun ’ rocked @entity29 ’s scandal - prone government , steadfastly avoids the limelight			1
her hair unkempt sitting outside a tapas restaurant in @entity21 ’s @entity34 , cigarette in one hand and a bottle of beer on the table in front of her , ms @entity8 happily chatted with friends			1
but approached outside her shabby , one - bedroom flat in nearby @entity46 , @entity21 yesterday the woman who was seldom far from the headlines in 1992 was not keen to talk			1
she gruffly barked : ‘ i do n’t want to speak to any journalists , ’ before slamming her front door			0
the minister and his mistress conducted their affair in a @entity21 flat lent to the actress by one of her friends , who bugged his own phone and sold the tapes to a newspaper			1
contrast : although she was wrapped up in a coat , the item of clothing most associate with @entity65 is still a certain @entity6 shirt the lover : @entity10 , pictured on the night he quit as heritage secretary in 1992 , following a number of scandals , including his affair with miss @entity8 in the ensuing blaze of embarrassing publicity , then secretary of state for national heritage mr @entity10 tried to convince the world that his marriage to ever - loyal wife @entity77 was fine , despite ms @entity8 ’s sordid sex revelations , lining up his entire family behind the garden gate at his in - laws ’ cottage in @entity83 for press photographers			1
the minister remained in the @entity19 for several months until he quit after it was revealed that he had accepted a free holiday from femme fatale @entity88 , the daughter of a @entity90 official			0
two years later mr @entity10 admitted another affair , with the married @entity92 , and he was divorced by his wife in 1995			1
ms @entity8 , the daughter of a @entity95 father and @entity97 mother , says she made around £ 30,000 for her kiss ‘ n tell story - arranged by pr guru @entity99 - and cites the affair and attendant publicity as the cause of her failed marriage to dental surgeon @entity105			1
they married in 1994 but divorced a couple of years later			0
following the affair she took part in a tv documentary @entity111 , became agony aunt of @entity114 magazine and imported textiles , rugs and jewellery from @entity118 and @entity119			2
in a newspaper interview in 2002 to mark the 10th anniversary of her revelations , ms @entity8 confessed that certain sordid details of her affair with mr @entity10 were untrue			1
rough patch : miss @entity8 , wrapped up in a fur coat against the january @entity21 weather in notting @entity128 , still blames the 1992 affair for the collapse of her marriage two years later retraction : a decade after her saucy affair with @entity10 was splashed across @entity7 's newspapers , @entity65 admitted she made up the @entity6 club strip , the spanking and the infamous ' toe sucking ' back to her roots : @entity139 visited a tapas restaurant where she enjoyed a @entity95 beer and a cigarette with a friend ‘ the @entity6 strip was made up , ‘ she admitted			1
‘ i went along with everything at the time			0
it was almost like i was having an out - of - body experience			2
’ asked about the spanking and toesucking , she added : ’ it did n’t happen			0
’ she also addressed the question everyone asks her about the affair			0
‘ what the hell attracted me to him ? that ’s a question i sometime ask myself on very rare moments at awkward times in my life			0
‘ oh @entity163 , absolutely nothing attracted me to him physically			0
but sometimes you meet somebody who is not an oil painting but you can forget about that and it ’s no longer important , it ’s who they are and what they ’re like inside , ’ she explained			0
‘ the excitement was , to be perfectly frank , from being with somebody who was in a peak position of power			0
’ former minister turned opera critic mr @entity10 , who lives with his partner @entity181 at their @entity183 - side home in @entity185 , remains irked by the false football strip claims			1
giving evidence to the @entity188 into media standards last june he said he was ‘ sick ’ of hearing about them			0
‘ it was a total invention			0
‘ all you will remember about me when i go to my grave is some bloody @entity6 shirt			2
’ when @entity8 's affair with @entity10 was revealed in 1992 , it kicked off a course of events which contributed to the downfall of @entity29 's government			1
mr @entity10 was backed by the prime minister , and repeatedly professed his commitment to his wife in an effort to keep his job as @entity207			2
but after it emerged that he had accepted a free holiday from a glamorous socialite whose father was a @entity212 he was finally forced to resign			0
the string of scandals eventually led to the break - up of mr @entity10 's marriage to his wife @entity77 - and had wider repercussions within the @entity219			2
other ministers such as @entity221 and @entity222 were also revealed to have had affairs , while rising star @entity224 was found dead in what was believed to be a case of auto - erotic asphyxiation			0
the succession of embarrassing incidents was widely held to have undermined mr @entity29 's ' @entity231 ' campaign which emphasised the importance of family values and other traditional @entity11 issues			0
couple with a wave of sleaze scandals such as @entity238 allegedly agreeing to ask questions in @entity240 in return for a bribe , the affairs played into the hands of @entity245 's @entity244 , which swept to power in 1997 with a landslide election victory			0
one of the reasons mr @entity10 's indiscretions became so memorable was the addition of vivid details such as his wearing a @entity6 football shirt during sex , which was splashed over the front page of the @entity255 , above right			1
however , ms de @entity8 later admitted she had made up that particular anecdote .			2
