@entity0 had just returned home after the school run and glanced outside when she noticed something was seriously wrong			1
@entity4 , the family 's five - year - old black and white cat , was lying lifelessly in the garden of their @entity9 home			1
when @entity0 picked him up , his breathing was laboured and his body was limp			1
within hours , his condition had deteriorated , so her husband @entity13 , a 37 - year - old teacher , rushed him to the vet where he was kept in overnight			2
but , by the time @entity13 got home , @entity17 , their other cat , was showing similar symptoms			1
@entity13 turned round and rushed back to the vet with the tabby , but nothing could be done			0
@entity4 and @entity17 had to be put down			0
like many cherished pets , @entity4 and @entity17 had been a huge part of the family , which includes @entity28 , four , @entity29 , three and @entity30 , 22 months			0
their shock at the sudden deaths was compounded when @entity0 and @entity13 were told by the vet that their cats were victims of anti-freeze poisoning			1
@entity0 ( left ) with surviving cat @entity39 had to have two cats put down due to being poisoned by antifreeze while @entity43 was thankfully able to save her cat @entity45 ( right ) who ingested the toxic chemical @entity4 and @entity17 are just two of a staggering 50 cats killed in @entity49 every month by anti-freeze , commonly used in countless car engines and to de-ice thousands of windscreens in winter			1
yet it 's no longer just being used to defrost vehicles , there 's a growing trend among the green - fingered for adding anti-freeze to garden water features to prevent pumps and jets from frosting up and to keep the water flowing			1
cats are then drinking from these ornamental pools and ingesting the de-icer			1
many brands contain sweet tasting chemical ethylene glycol which is attractive to small mammals but , extremely toxic , even in small doses , and can rapidly lead to kidney failure and often a painful death			1
in the first four hours after being poisoned — like @entity4 — cats can appear wobbly on their feet , and start drinking and urinating to excess as dehydration sets in			1
cats can also become overly sleepy			1
as the toxin sweeps through the body over hours and sometimes days , cats will stop eating , possibly vomit and be unable to stand			1
if that stage has not already proved fatal , kidney failure then kicks in			1
according to the @entity81 , which offers vets specialist advice about poisoned pets , 90 per cent of cats who swallow anti-freeze die as a result			1
the number of cats dying from ethylene glycol poisoning has risen so sharply in recent years , according to @entity92 according to the @entity92 charity , the number dying from ethylene glycol poisoning has risen so sharply in recent years , it has become little short of an epidemic , and the charity has been joined by other animal welfare organisations , vets and politicians in voicing concern			1
the problem was debated in the @entity105 earlier this month , with environment minister @entity106 calling for products containing ethylene glycol to be labelled with clear warnings that they could be harmful to pets			1
the alerts could prove a powerful deterrent for garden - lovers who are unaware that by using the substance to defrost their water features they could be inadvertantly poisoning local moggies and wildlife			0
the commons debate was called by @entity123 , the @entity124 mp for @entity125 , after at least 22 cats died in @entity127 , @entity128 , because of it			1
' the problem of anti-freeze poisoning is becoming increasingly widespread , and i ca n't over-emphasise what a horrific death it is for a small animal , ' says mr @entity123			1
while the use of anti-freeze in ornamental garden features is being blamed for a sharp rise in anti-freeze poisoning among pets in winter , some distraught cat owners — including those in the mining village of @entity127 — harbour suspicions that their pets were poisoned deliberately			1
what is certain is that hundreds of owners , like the @entity148 , are being left traumatised after watching their cats dying an agonising death			1
' what happened to @entity4 and @entity17 was a terrible shock , ' says @entity0 , 31 , a full - time mother			1
' i was in tears because @entity4 did n't want to eat or drink and was very floppy			0
his eyes rolled back , as though he could n't see , which was distressing to watch			0
@entity13 took him to the vet , who mentioned possible anti-freeze poisoning , which shocked me			2
my first thought was : ' who could do this ? ' ' we have another cat , @entity39 , and she 's been fine , so it 's possible it was an accident , but i do n't let her out of my sight at the moment			2
' there 's a growing trend among the green - fingered for adding anti-freeze to garden water features to prevent pumps and jets from frosting up and to keep the water flowing - which is then being ingested by cats according to professor @entity176 , of the @entity178 's @entity177 , accidents happen easily because it takes only a tiny amount of anti-freeze to poison cats			1
' they need a much smaller dose than dogs to cause problems , ' she says			0
' it 's possible that a cat just walking through a pool of anti-freeze and then cleaning its paws may be enough			1
' it 's common for cats with anti-freeze poisoning to become ill so quickly that there is n't time for treatment , says prof @entity197			1
a lucky few can be treated with an ethanol , or alcohol , drip which acts as an antidote , although she warns : ' the earlier a cat can be treated the better , but even if treatment starts early the kidneys can still have problems			2
' vets were unable to save @entity209 's 11 - month - old tabby kittens , @entity210 , when they were poisoned in july			0
one sunday , @entity209 , 47 , who lives in @entity213 , @entity214 , with her partner @entity215 and three children @entity217 , 17 , @entity218 , 15 , and @entity219 , 14 , noticed @entity221 's back legs were n't working properly			0
@entity222 also had a strange odour , which @entity209 put down to him walking in fox mess			0
the next day , hospital worker @entity209 was called by @entity217 , at work , to say he was worried			0
' i told him to take a taxi straight to the vet			0
in the afternoon , they called me to say they believed the cats had anti-freeze poisoning			1
they said they could try to save them , but we 'd be looking at £ 700 per cat and it would only prolong their agony , because their kidneys had failed			2
' i told the vet to put them to sleep			0
he said it was strange , because anti-freeze poisoning never normally happens in summer			2
he also said they were the fourth case they 'd treated over the weekend			0
so i do n't know what happened			0
' @entity252 went through a similar ordeal with her black and white cat @entity255 in october			2
@entity252 , 46 , a writer from @entity256 , @entity257 , was at home with her husband @entity259 , 46 , a golf professional , and their children , @entity263 , 12 , @entity28 , seven and @entity264 , six , when @entity255 became ill. ' i found @entity255 lying on the doormat , panting for breath and retching			0
i knew instinctively she was dying			0
i realised there was n't time to get her to the vet , and i did n't want her to die in the car , so i made her as comfortable as i could			0
' twenty minutes later @entity255 was dead			0
' it was awful because there was nothing i could do ' , says @entity252			0
' she kept convulsing and bit through her tongue			0
' later , @entity252 looked up her symptoms online and found they matched anti-freeze poisoning			2
@entity43 and @entity284 's kitten @entity45 is one of the lucky few to have survived anti-freeze poisoning			2
when she came home one night in october soaking wet , the couple from @entity286 , @entity287 , towelled her dry			2
but next morning she was sick so they rushed her to the vet			0
' they told us it was anti-freeze poisoning and they did n't think she was going to survive , ' says @entity43			2
' we did n't want her to suffer , so agreed to put her down			0
' but a visiting vet suggested trying a vodka drip , because the ethanol can neutralise the poisonous effects			0
' @entity45 was transferred to a surgery in @entity301 , where the alcohol was administered over two days			0
' she was noticeably drunk , with her eyes out of focus , but it worked			0
after a few days in intensive care we were allowed to take her home with tablets to combat the damage to her kidneys , ' says @entity43			0
' it was touch and go for about ten days , but now she 's back to normal			0
' the £ 2,000 cost was met by their pet insurance			0
experts advise anybody who thinks their cat might have ingested anti-freeze to seek veterinary help as soon as possible — but it 's clear that a better solution needs to be found			1
@entity123 is campaigning for the government to make it mandatory for anti-freeze products to include @entity326 — a substance which makes harmful products unpalatable			1
but @entity92 point out that there 's no evidence to suggest cats would be put off by a bitter taste			1
' bittering agents are not the answer , or at least not the whole answer , ' says their advocacy manager , @entity336			0
' we are concerned that seeing the addition of a bittering agent on an anti-freeze label may give pet - owning purchasers the false impression that the product is safe			2
' in the longer term , we 'd like to see anti-freeze manufacturers developing alternative non-toxic products			1
' in the meantime , says prof @entity197 : ' if you use anti-freeze , do n't use one with ethylene glycol in it and tell others about the risks			2
' her words would no doubt be echoed by owners of cats that have perished in this horrific way .			2

@entity0 lost two cats in one night after they drank the toxic chemical
cat deaths from anti-freeze have risen to almost epidemic proportions
sweet taste is attractive to animals but can lead to kidney failure and death
environment minister is now calling for products to carry warning labels
