by @entity0 , chief political correspondent published : 20:36 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 02:36 est , 28 october 2013 sir @entity1 : his successor @entity2 , incoming head of the @entity3 has a agreed to a 10 per cent pay cut to set an example to other managers health chiefs have been ordered to crack down on ‘ unacceptable ’ fat - cat pay in the @entity3			1
in a stinging letter , health secretary @entity9 told them last night it was time for a ‘ collective reality check ’ on the highest salaries			1
he urged them to ‘ show leadership by controlling pay among our most senior managers ’			0
and he warned that the sight of managers being handed lavish salaries while ordinary @entity3 workers are subjected to years of pay restraint risked ‘ damaging public confidence ’			1
mr @entity9 said the pay of senior managers ‘ should be subject to significantly greater restraint than that experienced by frontline @entity3 staff ’			1
in future , health bodies wanting to pay someone more than £ 100,000 will first have to get the health secretary ’s permission			1
mr @entity9 also plans to cap the number of managers on six - figure salaries			1
health bosses have been told to conduct a pay audit to establish how many @entity3 managers are being paid more than £ 100,000			1
and , in a move that could prompt legal action from some managers , mr @entity9 plans to rewrite contracts to cap the level of pay - offs and end the ‘ revolving door ’ , where senior managers can be paid off by one part of the @entity3 , only to take up a new post elsewhere shortly afterwards			1
the pay controls will directly affect the eight quangos that oversee the running of the @entity3			0
between them they employ thousands of staff			0
a source said mr @entity9 had been moved to act after it was revealed that 48 @entity3 quango staff are paid more than the prime minister			1
the new edict will also be rolled out to hospitals , although it will not apply to clinical staff such as senior consultants			0
the health service @entity65 and the @entity67 will write to all foundation hospitals and health trusts asking them to ‘ follow the lead ... in applying restraint ’			2
in his letter to health chiefs , mr @entity9 said it was ‘ vital that we stay in tune with the public mood ’ on top pay in the public sector			1
‘ i am concerned that the number of people on salaries higher than the prime minister has become too high across the @entity3 , ’ he said ‘ this is unacceptable and unjustified at a time when significantly lower - paid frontline staff are faced with below inflation pay increases			1
‘ i believe that it is time for a collective reality check – we must not develop a culture where very high pay is normalised			1
i do not want the @entity3 to make the same mistakes as the @entity95 , where a culture of excessive pay and pay - offs was tolerated for too long and damaged public confidence			2
’ a government source pointed to the example set last week by @entity2 , incoming head of @entity104			0
mr @entity2 , who will replace sir @entity1 in april , has agreed to take a 10 per cent salary cut in his first year			0
it means he will be paid £ 189,900 , compared with the £ 211,000 of his controversial predecessor			0
time for a reality check : health secretary @entity9 has ordered a crack down on what he has branded ' unacceptable ' pay - offs and salaries handed out to senior managers the @entity3 has spent £ 1.4billion on redundancies since 2010 and in the past year more than 950 staff were given six - figure redundancy packages the reforms will also create tough rules on pay - offs to senior @entity3 managers			1
the @entity3 has spent £ 1.4billion on redundancies since 2010 and in the past year more than 950 staff were given six - figure redundancy packages , up from 620 the previous year			1
a @entity123 report into the shake - up of @entity104 found that 44 ‘ very senior managers ’ who were laid off received up to £ 578,470 in redundancy payments			2
the average was £ 277,273			0
lax rules have also allowed hundreds of managers to walk into new @entity3 jobs weeks after pocketing huge pay - offs			2
since may 2010 , at least 2,200 staff – mostly bureaucrats – have been re-employed by a trust after taking redundancy			2
@entity3 managers who are made redundant receive one month ’s pay for every year served , with the average payout since 2010 standing at £ 48,000			2
under existing rules , @entity3 staff have to wait only four weeks after being paid off before they can take up a job with another part of the organisation			0
the new proposals mean managers will have to refund part of any pay - off if they take up another @entity3 job within 12 months			0
pay - offs for senior staff will be limited , with the maximum salary used to calculate payments capped at £ 80,000			0
employer top - ups to pensions , which are often used as a sweetener in redundancy deals , will also be limited			0
controversially , mr @entity9 wants the new terms written into the contracts of existing @entity160 in the @entity3 means it is not possible for mr @entity9 to dictate salaries at individual hospitals			2
but the @entity164 source said they would be expected to fall into line			0
‘ we want to change the culture across the @entity3 , ’ the source said			2
‘ the letter has gone to the arms - length bodies we are directly responsible for			0
but i think hospitals will find it difficult not to act			0
