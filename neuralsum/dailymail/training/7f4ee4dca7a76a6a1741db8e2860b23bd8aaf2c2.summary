the prime minister ordered the attack after @entity8 surrendered to @entity25 in 1940 @entity1 was worried the @entity32 fleet would fall into @entity34 ’s hands and they could then be used to invade @entity23			1
he gave the @entity8 an ultimatum : scuttle the ships or send them across the @entity38			2

the massacre sparked a diplomatic crisis and has been described as the @entity8 @entity49			1
many across the @entity38 have never forgiven him			0
but while @entity1 was widely lauded in the @entity50 for his courage in sending out the message that @entity23 would fight the @entity53 – alone if necessary – a top secret telegram reveals he had his doubts			1
a copy of which is now going under the hammer reads ‘ @entity23 @entity57 forces ... asked the @entity8 @entity57 authorities to take certain steps to prevent a number of important @entity8 @entity57 units at this port from falling into @entity25 hands undamaged			1
‘ the @entity8 declined to take these steps			0

the attack on the @entity8 came a month after 338,000 @entity23 troops were evacuated from @entity106 and on the eve of the @entity108			2
general @entity109 told the @entity8 people the bombing was regrettable but rathered the ships and men were killed than they become part of a @entity25 force when @entity1 announced the news to the @entity50 he was cheered by all parties as it proved to the world , especially the @entity119 , that @entity23 was still up for the fight			1
the @entity8 responded by launching a demonstration bombing of @entity123 harbour			2

@entity137 , a historian at the @entity138 , said : “ it was an extremely controversial and unnatural thing to do as the @entity8 were our allies			0
' but we just did n’t trust the word of their admiral who told @entity23 that rather than let his ships fall into @entity25 hands he would scuttle them			0
' we could n’t take the risk of them not doing it and @entity1 ordered the attack			0
@entity1 feared the @entity8 fleet in @entity46 could fall in to @entity156 hands ' it was a calculated risk based @entity23 thinking the @entity8 was so demorilised they would n’t do anything			1

' the newly formed @entity167 cut off diplomatic relations with @entity23			2
' @entity109 , the leader of the @entity169 in @entity170 , made a very dignified statement over the radio to the @entity8 people stating that he absolutely regretted what had happened but he rather the ships and men were killed than they become part of a @entity25 force			0
