consumers may be eager to get their hands on @entity3 ’s @entity2 with its curved screen			1
but a report hints that the @entity7 firm is already working on its next - level displays for a fully foldable smartphone			1
unlike the curved models available now , such as the @entity12 and @entity14 ’s @entity13 , @entity3 's @entity10 could be flexible and bendy			1
a report hints that a fully foldable smartphone by @entity3 could be ready as soon as next year			1
this image shows prototype curved screens unveiled last year a spokesman for @entity21 told @entity22 : ‘ the industry believes that the commercialisation of foldable smartphones will be possible in 2016			1
’ a number of the curved screens , including those created by @entity14 and @entity3 , use high molecular substance - based polyimide film			1
this forms the backplane of the flexible panel and is used as an alternative to plastic			2
the material makes it possible to achieve the maximum curvature radius , which in @entity40 's display is 0.7 - inches ( 2mm )			2
polyimide film also helped reduce the thickness of the panel to significantly improve its flexibility			0
however , until other components such as batteries and processors are made to be flexible too , the dream of a roll - up smartphone will remain on the horizon			1
it is not only smartphones set to get the flexible treatment , as bendy displays could have many uses , such as in smartbands and laptops , for example			1
a spokesman from the industry said : ‘ when flexible display technology is being used in e-books and laptops , which are substituted for publications , the concept of tiny portable pcs and e-books will be realised in reality			1
’ rumours that @entity3 was working on a bendable and virtually unbreakable version of its @entity71 handset first surfaced in 2012			0
the false rumour said that the handset , codenamed ' @entity74 ' could be released in april 2013			0
last year , @entity14 demonstrated a 5.9 - inch display that can be bent more than 100,000 times without being damaged , at an exhibition in @entity78			1
it is not only smartphones set to get the flexible treatment , as bendy displays could have many uses , such as in smartbands ( illustrated ) and laptops , for example the foldable display is made of layers of lights using organic light emitting diodes ( @entity90 )			1
it features touch sensors , meaning it works as a touchscreen at all angles and curvatures , and was demonstrated at the @entity98 exhibition in @entity99			0
in july , @entity14 unveiled an 18 - inch screen that can be rolled up and it hopes to expand the technology to work with 60 - inch displays in the future			2
earlier this month , @entity3 revealed its next generation of @entity71 phones , including the @entity2 , which features a curved 5.1 inch display			1
on the @entity12 , notifications appear on either the right or left - hand side , depending on which hand the owner uses			2
up to five contacts can be programmed to appear on this edge , and each contact is assigned a colour			0
earlier this month , @entity3 revealed its next generation of @entity71 phones , including the @entity2 ( pictured ) , which features a curved 5.1 inch display to access a contact , users swipe the relevant colour and this reveals recent interactions and details about that person			1
conversely , swiping the long edge of the screen shows the time , weather or other customised notifications			0
and when the phone is placed face down , the edge glows to show a phone call , text or email has been received			0
if these messages are from a saved contact , the edge will glow the relevant colour			0
plus the curved screen increases the viewing width and height of videos and photos to make them appear @entity143			2
both the @entity144 and the @entity71 6 have metal cases and are the first to feature dual - standard wireless charging technology built inside the handsets			2
people will need to pay extra for a @entity3 non-slip wireless charger , but because it supports other standards both phones will work with any compatible charging dock			0
this image also shows the curvature of the phone 's screen @entity158 , vice president of online at @entity159 , told @entity160 : ' we 've created not only what 's next for the industry but set a new standard for smartphones			0
' ' we believe consumers and business alike will be impressed by the design but equally they 'll be taken by the power and performance			0
' what we 've accomplished is an elegant balance between design and technology			0
' the @entity12 and @entity175 will be available from 10 april in colours @entity176 , @entity177			0
the @entity12 will additionally be available in @entity180 .			0

next - generation model is *expected* to be flexible and bendy
current models such as the @entity2 only boast curved screens
industry expert hints that foldable phones could be on sale next year
technology could also lead to bendy laptops and smartbands , for example
