there were many who doubted @entity2 could repeat his achievement in @entity4 in turning a 1 - 0 deficit into a 2 - 1 test series lead , including at least six former @entity8 captains , but @entity9 was not among them			1
the extraordinary fourth @entity11 victory , @entity8 ’s first within three days against @entity4 since 1967 , was a triumph for a captain on the end of fierce criticism after the low of @entity17 ’s and a coach in @entity9 who had much to prove			1
the bitter aftermath of the worst winter in @entity8 ’s history increased the pressure on @entity2 and @entity9 but , finally , after the most searching examination , a new era brimming with promising talent looks close to glorious fruition			1
‘ he still wanted to do the job			2
if other people did n’t want him then fine , he ’d move on , but he made public his desire to captain @entity8			1
the more criticism he got the steelier he got , more determined			2
he ’s that sort of character			2
‘ i think he honestly said , when people were questioning him , that he would give it everything he had and he ’s still got the same approach			2
he ’s developing quickly tactically as a captain and he has great values			0
' there is nothing @entity2 would n’t do for @entity8 or for the team			1
and that ’s a good place to start			0
’ privately , the @entity8 hierarchy have always been adamant that @entity2 was going nowhere , not even , they insist , if that defeat at @entity60 had been followed by another in @entity62			1
yet @entity63 , the new managing director whose belief in @entity2 and @entity9 has never wavered , did not have to worry about that			1
this @entity67 series is not won yet but such was the spineless surrender of @entity4 at @entity31 , when salvation in the form of @entity71 was just around the corner , that it is difficult to see them possibly recovering at @entity75			1
stumping up : @entity2 leads the applause following the final wicket another victory in the final test would cement @entity2 as captain for next year ’s ashes , with @entity8 ’s next test cricket not coming until april in the @entity83 , of an exciting team who just needed to turn that potential into tangible success			1
did @entity9 , in his second coming as coach , ever doubt his captain ? ‘ no , because when you are close to somebody you get an idea of their will to do the job , ’ said @entity9			0
‘ he would openly admit that he ’s had a really rough ride but that can sometimes forge somebody into something special			0
‘ leadership is about getting people to follow you and creating opportunities for them			0
@entity105 is very much into that			0
deep down , he is a real carer as a bloke			0
he wants the team to grow			0
' that ’s why it ’s exciting , there are chances for all these young players coming in			0
there will be some changes as we go along but hopefully the leader is not someone you want to change too often			0
’ @entity121 : @entity122 ( right ) celebrates after taking the final wicket by bowling @entity124 over and out : @entity124 is comprehensively bowled by @entity122 and @entity8 win while @entity8 are on the up @entity4 have descended from a position where they could have claimed an historic series win on these shores to an absolute rabble under a captain in @entity131 who just did not look interested on saturday			1
@entity131 ’s hopeless slog to gift @entity133 one of his four wickets , as nine in all fell after tea on the third day in just 132 balls , summed up an @entity4 side who have appeared to lose focus ever since @entity131 became obsessed with trying to get @entity142 banned for the rest of the series			2
the @entity4 captain must have known bad weather was on the way to @entity148 yesterday and tomorrow yet he showed a complete lack of discipline			2
jumping for joy : @entity133 ( second left ) is congratulated after taking the wicket of @entity153 @entity8 ’s startling recovery should be placed in the context of @entity4 ’s fecklessness at the @entity157 and in @entity148 but it is also worth pointing out that the home side finally got the pitch at @entity31 , with pace and carry , they have craved all season			1
it is no exaggeration to say that @entity8 would probably have won all their tests this season if the pitches had replicated the one produced by @entity169			1
can it really be so hard for groundsmen ? ‘ that was one of the best cricket pitches i ’ve seen for a very long time , ’ said @entity9 of his old stamping ground			0
‘ it had something for everyone			0
’ for now it has helped restore the smile on the face of @entity184 cricket .			0

lots of former @entity8 captains said @entity2 should go
@entity8 have won last two tests after losing at @entity60
@entity2 's men crushed @entity4 at @entity31
