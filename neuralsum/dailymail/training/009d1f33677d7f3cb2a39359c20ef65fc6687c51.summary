a @entity1 entrepreneur who heads a hi - tech research project called ' avatar ' has contacted billionaires to offer them immortality			1
@entity6 claims he will personally oversee their immortality process , in exchange for an undisclosed fee			1
@entity6 , a media entrepreneur , claims to have hired 30 scientists to reach this goal - and aims to transplant a human brain into a robot body within 10 years			1
' you have the ability to finance the extension of your own life up to immortality			0
our civilization has come very close to the creation of such technologies : it 's not a science fiction fantasy			2
it is in your power to make sure that this goal will be achieved in your lifetime , ' says @entity6 in a letter delivered to billionaires listed in @entity31			2
eternal life ? @entity33 , a media entrepreneur , claims to have hired 30 scientists to reach this goal - and aims to transplant a human brain into a robot body within 10 years he has contacted a list of billionaires with a proposal for funding his quest for immortality - which @entity6 refers to as ' cybernetic immortality ' and the ' artificial body '			1
the initiative is opening its @entity47 office this summer , and will be launching a social media project connecting scientists around the world			2
' the 2045 team is working towards creating an international research center where leading scientists will be engaged in research and development in the fields of anthropomorphic robotics , living systems modeling and brain and consciousness modeling with the goal of transferring one ’s individual consciousness to an artificial carrier and achieving cybernetic immortality , ' says @entity6 's official site			1
' such research has the potential to free you , as well as the majority of all people on our planet , from disease , old age and even death			0
' ' for anyone interested , but skeptical , i am ready to prove the viability of the concept of cybernetic immortality by arranging an expert discussion with a team of the world 's leading scientist working in this field			1
' i will also be willing to coordinate your personal immortality project entirely free of charge for the sake of speeding up the development of these technologies , ' @entity6 , a 31 - year - old media entrepreneur , says that he aims to transplant a human brain into a robot body within 10 years			1
he says his technology will be of interest at first to the ' disabled and close to dying ' ' this project is leading down the road to immortality , ' says @entity6			1
' a person with a perfect @entity101 will be able to remain part of society			0
people do n’t want to die			0
' @entity101 : @entity6 's ' @entity101 ' project aims to ' load ' human minds into robotic bodies within 10 years ‘ i understand these are some very big challenges for scientists , ’ @entity6 says			1
‘ but i believe in something you call ‘ @entity112			0
’ if you put all your energy and time into something , you can make it a reality			0
@entity6 envisages surgically ' transplanting ' a human consciousness into a robot body within 10 years			1
he hopes to then ' upload ' minds without surgery , leaving human bodies as empty husks as their owners ' live on ' inside robots			0
the project is called @entity101 after the @entity128 movie , set far in the future , where human soldiers use mind control to inhabit the bodies of human alien hybrids as they carry out a war against the inhabitants of a distant world			1
' the next effort of science will be to create a new body for the human being , ' says @entity6 , speaking at the @entity142 conference			1
' it will have a perfect brain - machine interface to allow control and a human brain life support system so the brain can survive outside the body			2
' @entity6 says that the system will at first be of interest to , ' disabled people and people at the edge of dying			2
' ' the third phase will be to create an artificial human brain , ' he says - a computer environment into which human minds can be uploaded			2
measuring brain waves with @entity159 machine : recent breakthroughs have allowed scientists to ' see ' what is inside people 's heads for the first time - but could the technology really be used to create robot avatars ? his final goal , he says , is to upload human minds into holographic bodies			1
holograms give plenty of advantages			0
you can walk through walls , move at the speed of light , he says			0
‘ remember in @entity177 , @entity179 ’s hologram ? that was pretty amazing			0
’ @entity6 says he wants to work with @entity181 - the @entity182 in the @entity184 military			0
@entity181 is already researching ways for its troops to use their minds to remotely control androids who will take human soldiers ' place on the battlefield			0
the @entity194 's hi - tech research arm , has earmarked $ 7million for research into the project , also nicknamed @entity101			0
according to the @entity181 's 2013 budget : ' the @entity101 program will develop interfaces and algorithms to enable a soldier to effectively partner with a semi-autonomous bi-pedal machine and allow it to act as the soldier ’s surrogate			0

contacted list of world 's *richest* to offer immortality
will personally oversee brain transplant into robot body
entrepreneur claims to have 30 scientists working on project
aims to ' transplant ' human mind into robot body in 10 years
@entity225 ' next stage ' of science is to create a ' new human body '
