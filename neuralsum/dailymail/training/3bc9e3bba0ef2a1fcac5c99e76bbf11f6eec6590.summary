by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:54 est , 12 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:26 est , 13 december 2013 she might have earned the title ' @entity5 ' with her impeccably toned body post three children			1
but @entity8 , 32 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , finds keeping in shape a constant struggle because she 's not genetically predisposed to looking ' like a model ' or ' @entity14			1
' in her twenties she suffered from bulimia , which saw her weight fluctuate dramatically			1
at her heaviest , her 5ft 4in frame tipped the scales at 152lbs - putting her in the overweight category			2
often she would compare herself to her taller , leaner sisters or supermodels in magazines			2
' i was always heavier			2
her mother also battled weight problems and was put on a special diet in a bid to cure diabetes and high blood pressure			2
becoming aware of the connection between food intake and weight , ms @entity8 says , was a trigger for her eventual disordered eating			1
lots of hard work : the petite brunette was overweight and suffered from bulimia before getting in shape - she said the real turning point was meeting her husband and falling pregnant with her first child feeling ' lost ' in her early twenties , the self - described ' pear - shape ' brunette would binge and purge on sweet foods two to three times almost every day of the week			1
' i used disordered eating to fill an empty void			2
it was worse when i was feeling anxious			2
people often call bulimia the " good girl drug " because we do n’t do drugs or drink alcohol we just abuse food			2
' ' i had to let go of being perfect , when i became pregnant with my first child i was like " wow this is what my body is really made for " ' as is often the case with bulimia , ms @entity8 saw her weight yo - yo and her metabolism ' shut down '			1
although friends and family were aware of what was happening , they did n't know how to help			2
in the end it was ms @entity8 who made the conscious decision to start ' loving ' herself			1
determined to get physically fit and healthy , she started practicing mindful eating			2
however , the real turning point came when she met her husband , @entity93 , in 2007 and fell pregnant with her first son two years later			2
' i had to let go of being perfect , ' she said			2
' when i became pregnant with my first child i was like " wow this is what my body is really made for			1
" ' bouncing back : this photograph shows ms @entity8 one week after giving birth with her first child made for motherhood : ms @entity8 said she got healthier with each pregnancy through diet and exercise - here she is pictured carrying her first child in 2009 ( left ) and her third son in 2011 ( right ) looking back on her days as a bulimic , on her blog she writes : ' it was a horrible habit			1
' i felt like i had no control over my mind and i had such self - defeating thoughts			2
i felt a variety of emotions , sadness , guilt , emptiness			0
' after giving birth she started treating herself ' kindly ' and eating right			0
because she was in a regular pattern the pounds slipped away and she managed to slim down to 125lbs			0
' i think fitness always makes me happier it makes you feel like you can control so many things in your life ' ms @entity8 fell pregnant with another boy a year later in 2010 and again in 2011			1
each time , she said she was able to bounce back because the foundations of a ' toned figure ' were already in place			1
offering a tip to other women she said : ' be fit before you get pregnant			0
' now her favorite parts of her 125lb , size 2 body include her arms and ' toned abs ' but she is less enthusiastic about her ' short ' , ' muscular ' legs			1
' i do n’t have long legs			0
i never wear skinny jeans			0
' ms @entity8 came to the public 's attention last month when she posted a photograph of her toned post-baby body to @entity142 , captioned ' what 's your excuse ? ' stirring trouble : ms @entity8 came to the public 's attention last month when she posted this photo of her toned post-baby body to @entity142 the photo , which ms @entity8 has since used as her profile picture , shows her knelt alongside her three young sons , dressed in a workout bra and matching micro shorts			1
while many of her 256,000 followers cited her as an ' inspiration ' some also accused her of being ' insulting ' , ' obnoxious ' and a ' fat shaming bully '			1
indeed , one woman wrote : ' you are			0
hurtful to women and think way too much of yourself			0
disgusting is what you are ! ' ' if i can make health a priority as a working mom of three kids who has struggled with bulimia and weight issues , then you can too ! ' and a mother - of - two named @entity172 added on ms @entity8 's website , mariakang.com : ' i have two kids and both have caused my skin to stretch soo bad my stomach , from my rib cage straight down the the middle of my vaginal area , look like the @entity182 road atlas			1
' people like you who post pictures like this make people like me cry because i know that without surgery to lose the extra skin i will never look like you			0
' but ms @entity8 told @entity31 that she was merely being ' playful ' and saying if ' if i can make health a priority as a working mom of three kids who has struggled with bulimia and weight issues , then you can too ! ’ to maintain her figure she likes to do 30 to 60 minutes of ' intense ' strength training and cardio every morning , five to six days a week			1
keeping fit and healthy : ms @entity8 said that she did n't intend to upset people and she hoped the photo would inspire others to feel better about themselves breaking a sweat : the pretty brunette says that she likes to do 30 to 60 minutes of strength training and cardio every morning , five to six days a week on a typical day she tries to get to the gym before her sons wake up or in - between her morning errands			1
she then focuses attention on managing her elderly care homes and fitness progams for a non-profit she founded , fitness without @entity213 , which promotes fitness education in schools and local communities			0
' my issue is that people are often push body image before health			1
right now , i 'm talking about health ' ' i think fitness always makes me happier it makes you feel like you can control so many things in your life			0
it ’s the ability to be set a goal , take action , remain consistent and create a result			0
that process takes a lot of discipline			0
when it comes to food she likes to eat protein and carbohydrates at each meal			0
describing her daily diet she said : ' i have eggs and oatmeal or eggs and fruit for breakfast			0
' on the go i like to eat nuts – mainly almonds			0
lunch i usually have what we had for dinner the night before			0
today it will be turkey meatballs and sweet potato fries			0
' but it 's not all clean eating and , as a busy mother - of - three running on a budget , ms @entity8 has admitted to eating fast food , especially when it ’s convenient with her kids in tow			1
' i think fitness always makes me happier it makes you feel like you can control so many things in your life ' starting from a young age : she says her sons know how to do sit - ups because they watch her workout ‘ there are healthier fast food options that are affordable			0
for example , i like the $ 1.50 grilled chicken wraps from @entity278			0
' two of her other biggest temptations - bar pre-made chicken wraps - are dark chocolate and red wine			0
concluding on the topic of fitness and health she said : ' i think that we ’re obviously struggling as a nation with our weight and it ’s a sensitive issue			0
' my issue is that people are often push body image before health			1
right now , i ’m talking about health			0
’ ' i work to be a role model			1
it 's important to love yourself and remember to strive to be better physically , professionally and personally			1
