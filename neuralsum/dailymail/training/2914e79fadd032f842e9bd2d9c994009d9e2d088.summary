gifts : in a trial last year , @entity52 , 32 , ( left ) and her sister @entity53 , 34 , former employees of @entity55 and @entity3 , claimed the domestic goddess let them spend thousands of pounds on gifts today , tax specialist @entity59 explained in @entity61 how if an employer gives their employee anything that is not strictly needed for their work - such as luxury holidays and wedding receptions as it was implied in the @entity14 's trial last year - it should be declared as a taxable benefit			1

new start : @entity3 made her first public appearance since the ' mortifying ' trail this week to promote new show @entity31 ( cast pictured ) ' not only that , but the value of the gift must be converted into gross salary , so if someone is in the 40 per cent tax band and their employer pays for a wedding reception that costs £ 12,000 , that would have to be declared as £ 20,000 of income for tax purposes			1
' he said it was up to the employee to ensure they paid the correct income tax			0
a spokesman for @entity11 said : ' we do n't discuss specific tax affairs but in general the rules say that when you benefit from something provided to you by your employer there may be a tax charge			2
