@entity0 will face @entity1 for the first time this weekend since leaving the club in 2011			1
but how have previous @entity1 old boys fared in their first match against the club ? @entity7 @entity1 2 - 2 @entity8 , march 2010 @entity1 ’s greatest ever goalscorer returned to the @entity10 with @entity8 in the 2010 @entity12 quarter - final but started on the bench			1
he replaced @entity14 — who scored both goals in the 2 - 2 draw — late on and was unsurprisingly given a hero ’s welcome			0
@entity7 was given a hero 's welcome by the @entity1 supporters when he returned with @entity8 @entity21 @entity1 2 - 0 @entity22 , march 2006 after leaving for @entity22 in the summer of 2005 , the midfield general returned the very next season in the @entity12 quarter - final			1
despite a warm reception , @entity21 was on the wrong end of a 2 - 0 scoreline and picked up a booking , which ruled him out of the second leg			0
@entity21 received a warm reception from the @entity1 fans but ended up losing with @entity22 @entity33 @entity34 2 - 1 @entity1 , november 2012 after the @entity36 left for @entity34 in 2012 , he was jeered by his old fans when @entity1 travelled to @entity38			2
it did not take long for him to remind them of what they were missing - he scored after just three minutes in a 2 - 1 @entity34 win			2
@entity33 took just three minutes to score against his former club as he went on to win with @entity34 @entity44 @entity1 1 - 0 @entity45 , april 2012 it was a lukewarm reception for @entity44 when he made his first return to the @entity10 in 2012			1
there were some early boos but the home crowd need n’t have worried as @entity44 ’s @entity45 side were undone by a late @entity53 winner			0
@entity44 received a few boos on his return to the @entity10 and was unable to stop the home side winning @entity57 @entity1 0 - 1 @entity45 , november 2011 the @entity58 was given some horrendous abuse when he returned to the @entity10 after his move to @entity45 in 2011			1
but @entity57 had the last laugh as his new team won at @entity1 for the first time in 36 years to seal a place in the @entity66 semi-finals			2
@entity57 received horrendous abuse on his @entity1 return but managed to clinch a result with @entity45 @entity70 @entity45 4 - 2 @entity1 , september 2009 after swapping @entity1 for big - spending @entity45 in a £ 25million deal , the @entity72 striker scored against his former club at the @entity76			1
but there was no refusal to celebrate here			0
@entity70 sprinted the length of the pitch to revel in front of raging @entity1 supporters as @entity45 won 4 - 2			0
@entity70 ran the full length of the pitch to celebrate his goal in front of raging @entity1 supporters			0
