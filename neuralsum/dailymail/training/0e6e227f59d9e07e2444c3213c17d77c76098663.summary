by @entity0 you may think that virtual reality is only used for playing video games but the technology is now helping people with autism overcome crippling phobias and allow them to live more normal lives , researchers have found			1
a virtual reality room is being used to enable people to experience the thing that terrifies them the most in a safe environment			1
using the technology , eight out of nine children were able to tackle the situation they feared			1
using the technology , eight out of nine children were able to tackle the situation they feared @entity27 said that four of the children taking part were found to have totally overcome their phobia			1
the treatment involved sitting in a room surrounded with screens which , using virtual reality technology , can be transformed into the situation that the patient fears			1
after using relaxation techniques and sitting alongside a psychologist , the child can gradually be introduced to the scenario			1
people suffering autism often face phobias which are so acute they and their families will avoid the situation			1
scenarios created at the @entity48 suite in @entity49 include getting on a busy bus , crossing a high bridge , talking to a shop assistant or going shopping			1
people with autism ( illustrated with a stock picture ) often suffer from phobias which are so acute they and their families will avoid the situation the study , published in the journal @entity59 , tested the technology on nine boys aged between seven and 13			1
dr @entity62 , clinical senior lecturer specialising in @entity63 at @entity27 ’s @entity64 said : ‘ phobias have a huge impact on a child with autism and on the whole family			1
‘ parents often find themselves taking action to avoid the situation the child fears , which can impact on school and leisure activities			2
‘ currently the main treatment is cognitive behaviour therapy but that often does n’t work for a child with autism , as it relies on imagination			1
‘ people with autism can find imagination difficult so by providing the scene in front of the child ’s eyes we help them learn how to manage their fears			2
’ the screens in the suite create a 360 degree seamless world , without the need for the child to wear a headset or goggles			2
a tablet is used to move around the scene , allowing them to explore the situation they have previously found traumatic and parents can watch from outside via a videolink			0
researcher dr @entity101 said : ‘ one boy was so fearful shopping that he would walk behind his parents with his hood up , refusing to even speak to people he knew			0
‘ we created a petrol station kiosk scene in the @entity48 where he picked up a newspaper			2
‘ with the help of the psychologist who was in the room with him , he learnt to control his anxiety with breathing and stretching exercises			2
‘ he then built up confidence over four sessions until he held a conversation with the shop assistant avatar			1
‘ at home his parents encouraged him to do more of the shopping on his own and use the techniques they had seen him practice			0
one parent of an autistic child involved in the experiment said that he feared heights and it was impossible to go on escalators ( pictured )			0
but after four sessions in the simulator , he was able to cross a bridge - something he could n't do before ‘ the therapy was so successful that he is now able to go shopping with his friends			0
’ dr @entity62 added : ‘ parents told us that they could see the difference in their children over the course of the four session programme - their children are now much better at coping with the situations that they once found distressing			0
twelve months later , the children are still able to cope			0
‘ this treatment has led to big changes in the lives of some families			0
to see a child who could n’t get on a crowded bus do so after just four weeks of treatment is amazing			0
’ @entity154 , director of @entity156 ’s @entity155 , said : ‘ a chance to explore stressful scenarios in a safe , virtual environment could help those whose lives are dominated by anxiety to better manage their fears , improving their quality of life			2
’ one parent of an 11 - year - old , who was afraid of heights , said : ‘ his phobia was so severe that even going somewhere like the @entity173 would be problematic , as we would have to stick to the ground floor			0
‘ it was just impossible to go on the escalators			0
even picking my son up would be too much for him at times , even that height scared him			0
‘ but after just four sessions in the simulator he was able to tackle a real life bridge that he had never been able to cross before			2
it has just made such a difference to our lives			0
