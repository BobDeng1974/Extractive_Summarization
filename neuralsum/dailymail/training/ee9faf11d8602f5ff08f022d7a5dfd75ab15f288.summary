a mixed race girl was subjected to monkey taunts by a gang of racist yobs after she accidentally stumbled into a @entity5 meeting			1
the seven - year - old had gone with her parents to a social club in @entity9 , @entity10 , to book their wedding reception but inadvertently walked into a room where 14 far - right activists were discussing group tactics			1
the yobs turned round as the girl walked through the door , and as soon as they saw her began shouting : ' f * * * off back to where you come from ' and started making monkey noises at her , it has been claimed			1
@entity24 : the little girl was apparently bombarded with foul , racist language and monkey noises by the far - right @entity5			1
members ( unconnected with this case ) are pictured here at a protest in @entity32 the bewildered girl ’s mother who is white and father who is from @entity36 pulled the youngster out of the room and reported the incident to police			1
enquiries revealed the yobs had taped over @entity44 cameras at @entity45 , but some footage has been recovered by police and is now being studied to identify the culprits			0
today the girl ’s parents , aged 30 and 31 , said no attempt had been made by club officials to turf the racist yobs out of the venue			1
they said the room had been decked out with @entity57 flags and banners emblazoned with nationalist slogans			0
in an interview with @entity61 , the girl ’s mother , of south @entity10 , said their wedding plans were now in disarray because they would not set foot in the venue again			1
@entity45 in @entity9 , @entity10 , where the alleged racist incident took place they insisted there was no doubt the abuse was directed at their daughter			1
the mother said : ' they were shouting and telling her to f * * * off back to where she came from and making monkey noises			1
' luckily , she did not really know what was going on , but i ’ve brought her up to know that although she has different - coloured skin she is the same as everyone else			2
' if she had understood what they were saying it could have scarred her for life			0
' mayor of liverpool @entity90 said : ' this incident has made me sick to the pit of my stomach			2
' it ’s hard to believe that so - called human beings can stoop to this sort of level			2
thankfully the little girl does n’t seem to have understood what was going on , but these would not have known that , they would n’t have given a toss			2
far - right : the @entity5 supports the expulsion of all non-whites from the @entity107 ' we must be seen to challenge this kind of abhorrent behaviour and be tough on it when it is exposed			1
' detective inspector @entity112 of @entity113 said : ' this has been a very distressing incident for a young girl and her family			2

a full investigation into the incident is underway and i would urge anyone with any information to come forward			0
