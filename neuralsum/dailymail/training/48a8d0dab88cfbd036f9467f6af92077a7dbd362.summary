@entity0 has warned @entity1 that he is not @entity3 's weak link as he steels himself for the onslaught he knows is coming at the @entity5			1
the rookie @entity7 fly half has the vision to unlock @entity1 when the @entity10 opens in @entity11 on friday night , but his light frame means doubt persists over his defence despite solid outings against @entity16 and @entity17 in the autumn			1
@entity21 centre @entity19 will be the main battering ram directed at @entity23 , but roaming wings @entity24 and @entity26 , as well as the home back row , are sure to test his courage			2
@entity3 's fly half @entity0 insists he 's not the weak link ahead of the @entity10 opener with @entity1 as the likely focal point for the @entity35 power game , the 21 - year - old @entity23 is ready to roll up his sleeves to halt the heavy traffic coming down his channel			1
' i know what 's coming			2
it happens in most matches you play as a 10 - you get targeted , ' said @entity0 , who will be making only his third @entity45 start			1
' they look for you defensively and want you to make you tackles			0
it 's something you expect and prepare for			2
the @entity7 player knows he 'll be targeted by the @entity35 but he 's ready for the upcoming battle in @entity11 @entity23 ( centre ) is known for having a brilliant rugby brain and has the vision needed to cause @entity1 problems ' they want you to make as many tackles as possible to take other aspects of your game away , whether that 's your attack , kicking game or game management			1
' i like that part of the game - i like the responsibility of making my tackles because i want to contribute in defence as well as attack			2
' @entity23 has been among of the beneficiaries of ' hymns and @entity70 ' being played at full volume over the loudspeakers during training at the squad 's @entity75 base on wednesday in preparation for the noise and passion that await at the @entity5			1
@entity3 have insisted on the roof not being closed , opting not to fall into line with the wishes of @entity1 in the hope of diluting the hostile atmosphere that will greet their attempt at making a triumphant start to the @entity10			1
@entity19 ( left ) and @entity24 were identified as @entity1 ' danger men ahead of friday 's clash only eight of the matchday 23 have played in the @entity35 capital before and @entity23 , who shoulders the goalkicking duties on his first visit to @entity11 , is grateful for the meticulous preparation			1
' it was good training with the speakers on			0
they were obviously very loud , but it was definitely something we needed to do because of the atmosphere and noise that will be there on friday night , ' he said			0
' communication will be massive so to practice under those conditions will definitely be worthwhile			0
i 'm glad we did it			0
@entity0 impressed in his first two matches for @entity3 and knows he needs to exceed those levels in @entity11 ' i 'm excited about this game , about playing in front of a passionate @entity35 crowd			1
i 'll enjoy it and embrace it			2
we 'll try to quieten them as much as we can			2
' i have n't really thought about the goalkicking aspect			0
either way , you 've still got to kick and go through your pre-shot routine			0
' you 've still got to get the ball through the posts so whether it 's loud or quiet , it should n't really affect you anyway			0
@entity128 @entity127 ( left ) will partner @entity23 in the centre after his impressive season ' if it 's like that you 've got to get on with it			0
it does n't really make it easier or harder if it 's noisy anyway because you 're in your own little bubble , concentrating on the kick			0
' @entity23 will be looking to unleash @entity7 team - mate @entity139 on @entity1 with @entity3 boldly opting for the in - form but inexperienced outside centre to partner @entity127 in midfield			1
' @entity139 has been world - class in attack and his defence has been brilliant as well - he leads that at the club , ' @entity0 said			1
captain @entity146 will be hoping to lift the @entity10 with @entity3 for the first time since 2011 @entity3 's players train at @entity75 ahead of their @entity10 opener against rivals @entity1 ' @entity139 has that ability to create something out of nothing with an outside break or his off - loads with one hand			1
' in attack he offers something different with his speed , agility and outside break			0
it is our job , at the right time , to get him into the right positions to show what he can do			0
' there are n't many players around who can create things like that and to play with him is massively exciting			0
' he always wants the ball in his hands in attack , but he is also good at the things people do n't see , like his kick - chase and his communication about when to kick and so on			0
' @entity127 ( centre ) charges through the @entity3 line during training at @entity75 @entity182 ( centre ) has earned a spot on @entity186 's bench after a solid season with @entity188			1

@entity0 has warned @entity1 he is not @entity3 's weak link in the squad
the fly half knows he 'll be targeted but is ready for the stern test ahead
@entity0 was named in @entity186 line - up for the @entity10 opener
