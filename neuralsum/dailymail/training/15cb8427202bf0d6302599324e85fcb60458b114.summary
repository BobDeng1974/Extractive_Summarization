by @entity1 reporter published : 23:05 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 23:32 est , 16 june 2013 another major championship , another frustrating disappointment for @entity4 , not to mention his worst 72 - hole score since he turned professional in 1996			1
with a round of 4 - over - par 74 , @entity4 came in with a 13 - over 293 total , a shot higher than his previous worst week , a 12 - over at the 2003 @entity10			1
in other words , apart from the three times as a pro he missed a cut in a major championship , @entity4 never as bad as this			1
perhaps the comments made by his currently girlfriend @entity18 did n't help his concentration ? on course : @entity18 watches boyfriend @entity4 from the gallery on the 18th green during the third round of the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 watching closely : @entity18 has been a staple at major championships since she started dating @entity4 three months ago @entity4 tamed ? @entity4 , pictured on sunday at the @entity25 at @entity31 in @entity26 , @entity27 , might be surprised to hear that girlfriend @entity18 compared herself to his wife she compared herself to @entity4 ' wife in an interview			1
the apparent slip of the tongue might surprise @entity4 , not to mention his recent ex-wife @entity38 , as @entity18 and @entity4 have been dating just three months			1
the 28 - year - old @entity40 skier has become something of a fixture on the golfing circuit as she has been pictured keeping a close eye on @entity4 at various courses			1
during a quiet moment at @entity31 in @entity26 , @entity27 on friday , ms @entity18 said that she did n't give the champion golfer advice about his game but she told the @entity51 : ' we talk golf after his golf rounds , but mostly i listen			0
we really are normal in that way			0
lots of people go home and talk to their wife or husband about their job			0
that ’s what we do			0
' there 'll be lots to discuss when the two of them go home			0
his tie for 32nd place was his worst finish as a pro at the @entity25			1
biggest fan : @entity18 waits near the clubhouse as she watches @entity4 during what has been a rocky performance by the golfer golf @entity81 : @entity18 , an @entity40 skier , made sure she had a @entity85 sponsor 's hat firmly on her head during a more casual appearance at a tournament exasperated : @entity4 reacts after missing a putt during the second round of the 2013 @entity25 ' there 's always a lesson to be learned in every tournament whether you win or lose , ' @entity4 said			1
' i 'll look back at the things i did right and the things i did wrong			0
' the no. 1 - ranked player in the world never broke par at the @entity25 , with four rounds in the 70s			2
woods , who has not won a major since the @entity105 in @entity106 , had little doubt as to why he played so poorly this week on a course many thought was ideally suited for his game			1
it was all about the putting , he grumbled afterwards			0
' i struggled with the speed all week , ' @entity4 said			2
' these greens are grainy			0
i struggled with the speed right around the hole			0
' woods missed too many fairways and took too many putts , a simple yet realistic way to look at his week			2
just two days ago , @entity4 was four shots out of the lead			2
then , he went 76 - 74 for his worst weekend in a major championship			1
@entity4 has now gone five years without winning a major championship , his last coming at the @entity129 , the 14th of his career			1
he will now try to regroup for the @entity131 at @entity132 in a month			0
off his game : @entity4 appeared to be disappointed with his performance on the course in @entity27 good day for golfing : thousands gather to watch @entity4 on the ninth green at the tricky @entity140 course glamor on the green : ms @entity18 ( second left ) watches @entity4 during the masters in @entity143 , @entity144 in april champion : @entity18 was keen to point out at the golf tournament that she was successful in her own right with her career as an @entity40 skier ms @entity18 was more of a casual presence on the sidelines than at previous competitions			1
the @entity40 skier has been dressed casually in a t - shirt , jeans , sunglasses and baseball cap from her sponsor @entity85 as she closely tracked @entity4 around the course			1
she tweeted on thursday : ' day one here we go ! ' before posting several pictures of golf fans ' muddy feet at the rain - sodden course			2
she also told the @entity51 : ' some people seem to forget that i ’m not just @entity4 ’s girlfriend			2
i ’m actually a successful athlete			0
i have my own career and my own life			0
' she added that she was ' very happy ' and that despite the constant attention that has come with dating the world 's most famous golfer , the relationship is ' worth it '			0
the four - time @entity177 skier is currently in training for the @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity181			2
she has been recovering from an injury to her left knee which happened during a downhill event in @entity185 , @entity186 in february			0
red carpet glamor : @entity4 and girlfriend @entity18 at the @entity188 in @entity189 last month in terms of the rest of the tournament , @entity191 ended a 43 - year @entity196 drought by winning the @entity25 and the sentimental and crowd favourite @entity197 celebrated his birthday with a second - place finish.five times a runner - up in this event but never a winner , fate seemed to be shining on @entity197 on his 43rd birthday			1
' for me , it 's very heartbreaking , ' @entity197 said after shooting a skittish 4 - over - par 74 in the final round , leaving him two shots behind the winner , @entity196 's @entity191			1
' this week was my best opportunity , i felt , heading into the final round , the way i was playing and the position i was in			2
' nice guys do n't always finish last			0
at the @entity25 , they keep finishing second			0
close run thing : @entity197 was around the top all day and suffered some terrible edges runner up - again : @entity197 certainly is n't the greatest player of his era			1
but he is the most beloved player of his generation			0

@entity4 shot a final - round 4 - over 74
he ended the tournament at 13 - over 293
woods ended up with *21* holes of bogey or worse
he matched his worst round as a pro
it 's now five years since he won a major championship
