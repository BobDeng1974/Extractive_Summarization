a father of four who was sacked over comments he made on @entity3 has been awarded more than £ 30,000 at an employment tribunal			2
@entity5 , 51 , worked for the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) as a meat hygiene inspector at @entity8 in @entity9			2
but he lost his job on november 5 last year after he ‘ liked ’ a posting on the social media site that appeared to encourage violent behaviour towards the manager			2
‘ i saw one of the guys from the abattoir put on that he was gutted he ’d been sacked			0
‘ i had n’t heard anything so i replied saying , “ sorry to hear that , hope you find something ”			0
he then said one of the other slaughtermen , @entity29 , had also been sacked			0
‘ then @entity29 joined in and said something daft that someone had hit one of the managers with his hard hat and i meant to put in “ @entity36 right , u wish ” and i hit the “ i ” button by mistake , so it came up “ @entity43 right , i wish ” , which was a genuine typo			0
‘ i never noticed at the time and the conversation went on and one of the guys said “ i should ’ve just f * * * * d him over the head with a chair ” and i ticked the “ like ” box			0
’ almost two weeks later mr @entity5 was approached by his manager who said there ’d been a complaint from the abattoir concerning comments on @entity3			1
@entity3 problems : mr @entity5 said the comment was ‘ just banter ’ , adding : ‘ as far as i was concerned it was a closed conversation			1
’ the @entity6 launched a disciplinary investigation , claiming the posts were a ‘ breach of trust ’ and ‘ not professional ’			1
however , mr @entity5 said the comment was ‘ just banter ’ , adding : ‘ as far as i was concerned it was a closed conversation			1
’ during the tribunal , the @entity6 claimed there had been a breakdown in trust and confidence between the agency and mr @entity5			1
but employment judge @entity71 , @entity72 , said : ‘ there was no objective reason to believe that his performance would in the future be different simply because of his foolish participation in what he had mistakenly believed to be a private online conversation that had become more public			1
’ mr @entity5 was awarded £ 32,799.13 for unfair dismissal but he says he has not received any of the money since the june ruling and would rather have his job back			2
he added : ‘ i regret liking the comment because i never meant to harm anyone			0
’ an @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ we are disappointed with the tribunal ’s conclusions but believe that the decisions managers took were the right ones given the circumstances at the time			0
