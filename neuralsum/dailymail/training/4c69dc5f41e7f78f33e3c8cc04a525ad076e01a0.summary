it was sad to leave @entity1 this week but once @entity2 had decided that he could n’t go on , it felt like the right thing to leave at the same time			1
@entity2 brought me in there to do a specific job and , once he had gone , there seemed no point in staying			1
it was a surprise how quickly it all turned out			2
@entity10 decided to leave @entity1 following @entity2 's resignation from the west @entity13 outfit @entity10 enjoyed his time at @entity1 but it was only right to leave the club following @entity2 's departure @entity2 has been in pain for some time with his knees and the news that he needed an operation was a real blow to him			1
last time that happened he was on crutches for 12 weeks			2
that said , we were in and out of the relegation zone and i reckon if @entity2 had been able to stay , we would have climbed out of the bottom three once again			1
everyone on the coaching staff was aware that we needed better results			2
but equally it looked as though fortunes were going to ebb and flow throughout the season among the teams towards the bottom			0
each week another team or manager seems to be under pressure			0
we were confident we could make sure it was n’t us by the end of the season			0
i ’ve heard all the theories as to why he left but i do n’t believe it was related to the january transfer window			0
the club tried to bring in the right players but , as deadline day approached , it simply became harder and harder			0
the 57 - year - old coach joined @entity1 ' coaching team in august 2014 i have enjoyed the past six months , however			1
i ’ve never been in a pure coaching role before and , though i was apprehensive when i went into it , i discovered that i really enjoyed it			1
clearly as manager there has to be a degree of distance between you and the team			0
you ’re always the man who has dropped half of the squad , so it ’s impossible to be too close			0
but that was n’t the case as a coach and i found i liked being that much closer to the players			1
i also enjoyed coaching the @entity71 at times			0
there are a good crop of players coming through at @entity1 from there			1
my hope for the club is that they do now stay up under a new manager			0
there were some good people at the club and i enjoyed my time there			0
as for the future , i have some business interests and i enjoy writing this column and of course i have my punditry with @entity88 and @entity89			2
some offers have come in but for now i ’ll take stock and work out what is best for me and my family			2
@entity10 ( far left , pictured at the @entity94 ) will focus on his punditry work before deciding on his future			1

@entity2 resigned from his role at @entity1 *due* to knee *injury*
