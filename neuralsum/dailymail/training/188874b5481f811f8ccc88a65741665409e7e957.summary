he 's already been married twice			2
but that did n't stop @entity2 from giving relationship advice after crashing a bachelor 's party in @entity5 , @entity6			1
the 63 - year - old offered some words of wisdom to the groom and his friends at a steakhouse over @entity13 weekend , captured on a video obtained by @entity15			1
they asked the waiter to send the actor free drinks , but @entity2 declined			1
one of the friends then went up to @entity2 and asked if he would say a few words to the groom , whose name was @entity42			1
@entity2 initially said no , but much to the mens ' delight , the star emerged and proceeded to dispense with some marriage advice			1
nice surprise ! the partygoers seemed giddy with excitement at having the famous actor crash their party he starts off by asking the men , who hail from @entity21 , whether they approve of their friend 's bride - to - be			1
' what do you think , thumbs up on her or not ? ' he asks , to which the friends laugh and answer yes			0
@entity2 then goes on to give some sage advice , seemingly off - the - cuff			1
good advice ! @entity2 suggests you take your love on a trip around the world before deciding if they 're the one having fun : @entity2 playfully put his head in his hands at one point while the men cheered ' you know how funerals are not for the dead , they 're for the living ? bachelor parties are not for the groom , they 're for the uncommitted , ' he told the unmarried men			1
he then explained how to figure out if the person you 're with is right for you			0
' if you have someone that you think is @entity83 , do n't just sort of think in your ordinary mind , " okay , let 's pick a date			0
let 's plan this and make a party and get married , " ' he said			1
' take that person and travel around the world			0
buy a plane ticket for the two of you to travel @entity95 , and go to places that are hard to go to and hard to get out of			0
and if when you come back to @entity97 , when you land in @entity97 , and you 're still in love with that person , get married at the airport			0
' he then picked up the groom and hoisted him over his shoulder while the men cheered			0
an auspicious beginning ! @entity2 spoke directly to @entity106 , the groom , before hoisting him over his shoulder good luck : @entity2 lifts @entity109 up in the air at the end of his impromptu speech at his bachelor party over the @entity13 weekend @entity2 has been married twice previously , first to @entity114 , from 1981 to 1996 , and then to @entity115 , whom he divorced in 2008 after 11 years of marriage			1
prior to their split , @entity115 accused @entity2 of physical abuse , alcohol addiction and infidelity			2
she said she felt forced to move the couple 's four sons to a new home as a result of his various issues			0
still searching : @entity2 has been married twice , pictured with his second wife @entity115 , whom he divorced in 2008 @entity2 is legendary for his unusual and creative interactions with the public			2
so much so that they have become modern day urban myths			0
each story usually ends with the @entity134 actor telling his flumoxed fans ' no one will ever believe you '			0
indeed , so prevalent have @entity2 stories become that a website has been created to collect them all			2
1 - @entity141 recounts one story when he left his laptop open at a @entity144 while he left to get a drink			2
when he returned , @entity2 was sitting in front of the screen , using the computer			2
stunned , @entity141 says that he simply let @entity2 continue whatever it was he was doing before standing up , saying , ' no one will ever believe you ' and walked off 2 - on another occasion a group of friends were in @entity157 karaoke bar , one 7 , when in walked @entity2 with a female friend			1
they invited the @entity161 actor into their booth , but he politely declined			0
fifteen minutes later he walked in and bought drinks for everyone and proceeded to sing an @entity166 song and then just as promptly as he arrived , left			0
3 - in 2010 , @entity167 was at @entity169 's @entity168 with members of the @entity171			2
he arrived at the city 's @entity173 bar and insisted on bartending			0
however no matter what they order he would only pour them tequila and lots of it			0
4 - in 2006 , @entity2 was in @entity181 , @entity182 , for a golf tournament when he went out drinking			1
he bumped into @entity185 student @entity184 , who invited him to a party			0
however , instead of dancing away the night , @entity2 decided to clean up all the student apartment 's entire dirty plates			1
5 - one @entity157 claims that he and his little brother were in @entity190 in the @entity191 when they noticed @entity2 in the same restaurant as them			1
he was eating pasta and had a bag of unopened chips next to him			0
one of the brothers was aware of @entity2 's unusual reputation for strange behavior so walked up to him , opened his chips , began to eat them and said , ' no one will ever believe you ! ' and walked away			1
@entity2 broke into raucous laughter and walked over to the men and gave them both a big hug .			2

@entity2 was in a @entity5 , @entity6 steakhouse at the same time as a groom - to - be 's bachelor party
was *convinced* to give an impromptu speech - which mixed wise words with humor
left the stunned party after telling them all to lift the groom - to - be over their shoulders
