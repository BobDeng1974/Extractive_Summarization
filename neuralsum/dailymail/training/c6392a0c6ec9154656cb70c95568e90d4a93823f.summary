@entity0 , pictured outside @entity2 's @entity1 , claims he can not be blamed for causing the six - car motorway pile - up because he was ' sleep driving ' at the time a risk management expert who says he was ' sleep - driving ' when he caused a six - car motorway pile - up - seriously injuring a ' bright ' student - says he can not be blamed for the smash			1
oil and energy consultant , @entity0 , was described as ' steaming past ' other motorists at 70mph in his @entity14 , before crashing into the back of a @entity17			1
the car was being driven by ' high - achieving ' @entity20 a-level student , @entity19 , then aged 19 , on a slip road off the @entity22 in @entity23 , on march 1 , 2012			1
mr @entity19 , now 22 , of @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , suffered permanent brain damage after being trapped in the crash which has had a ' devastating impact ' on his life			1
he is now suing mr @entity0 for massive damages at @entity2 's @entity1			2
but mr @entity0 , also an honorary lecturer in risk management at the @entity33 , is mounting a unique defence to the claim			2
his lawyers say he can not be held responsible for the crash because he passed out at the wheel following a sudden bout of sickness			1
the businessman , in his 60s , of the @entity43 , @entity44 , near @entity45 , @entity46 , denies that he was too ill to drive and says his blackout was totally unexpected			0
@entity48 , for mr @entity0 , claims he was in a ' state of automatism ' - similar to a sleepwalker - when he caused the crash			1
but mr @entity19 's lawyers say that defence - even if accepted - should not prevent the student from winning damages as an ' innocent party '			2
they dispute that mr @entity0 ' actions immediately before the crash are capable of supporting the automatism defence			2
they also insist he should not even have been on the road , as he was ' too ill to drive '			0
@entity61 , for mr @entity19 , told mr @entity62 : ' it was a very tragic and unusual accident			2
it is remarkable mr @entity19 survived			0
' he has suffered brain damage of a permanent nature			1
he was a very high achiever and that has caused a devastating impact on his young life			0
' mr @entity0 had been attending a work conference on the offshore gas industry , held at the @entity73 , in @entity23 when he was struck down with illness			0
after half an hour at the event , suffering symptoms of sickness and diarrhoea , he decided he could not stay			0
having obtained an emergency doctor 's appointment , he set off on the 50 - minute journey to his home			0
mr @entity0 said he had been driving at between 55 and 60mph when his abdominal pain became more severe and he decided to find somewhere safe to pull over			0
' @entity84 ' student @entity19 suffered serious head injuries in the crash and has been left with permanent brain damage but within three seconds , he felt ' as if his head were deflating ' and he blacked out , immediately before crashing into mr @entity19 's car			1
however , mr @entity19 's lawyers dispute that speed after witnesses claimed they saw him overtaking drivers who were going 70mph , in the outside lane			2
motorist @entity96 told the court he was able to estimate the speed of mr @entity0 ' car as he ' came steaming past '			1
mr @entity19 is now suing @entity0 for massive damages at the @entity1 in @entity2 ( pictured ) miss @entity101 added : ' it is mr @entity19 's case , quite simply , that if mr @entity0 felt so unwell he could not remain at the conference - which he had presumably paid to attend - then he was probably not in a fit state to drive himself home			1
' his judgment and ability would almost certainly have been impaired by reason of his distraction with his illness as well as his pain			0
' having chosen to take the risk of driving , it was incumbent on him to drive as slowly and safely as possible - driving at or over the speed limit and in the outside lane of the dual carriageway , does not constitute slow and safe driving			0
' the @entity1 hearing continues			0
