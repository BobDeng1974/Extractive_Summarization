on the run : @entity1 has been on the run from @entity4 authorities since he laid bare the extent of the @entity7 's spying programme , particularly on internet communication , such as emails , and social media @entity13 extremists have studied and exploited the leaks made by @entity7 whistleblower @entity1 to operate under the radar of @entity4 intelligence , a former agency chief has claimed			1
@entity17 said militants in @entity19 and @entity20 are ' clearly ' harder to track down since the rogue agent made freely available a wealth of top - secret information about how the @entity4 government hunts its enemies online			1
the terror group , @entity17 said , has drastically altered its evasive tradecraft as a result of the data spill , and now operates only in the darkest corners of the internet , where they remain one step ahead of the intelligence community			2
@entity17 , who was the @entity7 's deputy director when @entity1 exposed how the @entity7 eavesdrops , said the leak ' went way beyond disclosing things that bore on privacy concerns ' , and delved deep into the agency 's ' means and methods ' used to stay on terrorists ' tails			1
he told the @entity45 : ' having disclosed all of those methods , or at least some degree of those methods , it would be impossible to imagine that - as intelligent as they are in the use of technology , in the employment of communications for their own purposes - they would n't understand how they might be at risk to intelligence services around the world , not the least of which is the @entity4 and they necessarily do what they think is in their best interest to defend themselves			0
' @entity1 has been on the run from @entity4 authorities since he laid bare the extent of the @entity7 's spying programme , with particular regard to internet communication , such as emails , and social media			1
thanks to the @entity1 spill , terror groups have become far more internet savvy , expertly employing the web to disseminate propaganda and communicating only through the most clandestine of channels			2
thanks to @entity1 's leaks , the terror group has drastically altered its evasive tradecraft , operating only from the darkest corners of the internet , one step ahead of the intelligence community evil : @entity13 leader @entity84 , a @entity87 devotee from @entity19 , is known to have a sophisticated understanding of online evasive tactics , doubtless improved by @entity1 's disclosures @entity92 , who directs the @entity93 , agreed , adding : ' following the disclosure of the stolen @entity7 documents , terrorists are changing how they communicate to avoid surveillance			1
' they are moving to more secure communications platforms , using encryption and avoiding electronic communications altogether ' this is a problem for us in many areas where we have limited human collection and depend on intercepted communications to identify and disrupt plots			0
' @entity13 leader @entity84 , a @entity87 devotee from @entity19 , is known to have a sophisticated understanding of online evasive tactics , doubtless improved by @entity1 's disclosures			0
the @entity108 highlighted one example of how the leaks exposed the types of communications that should be avoided to evade capture			0
one of @entity1 's disclosures revealed how @entity4 caught and killed @entity87 confidant @entity114 in october 2012 after spies intercepted an email from his wife describing his whereabouts			2
' in @entity114 's case , the agency deployed an arsenal of cyberespionage tools , secretly seizing control of laptops , siphoning audio files and other messages and tracking radio transmissions to determine where @entity114 might ' bed down , ' @entity119 wrote			0
a @entity133 defense committee staffer said thursday : â€œ our lax security has provided our adversaries with a gold mine of information about our tactics and procedures			0

@entity17 , @entity7 deputy chief during leaks , says @entity143 ' clearly ' harder to find
says they altered tactics , allowing them to operate away from gaze of @entity4
he says @entity1 spill went ' way beyond disclosing privacy concerns '
leaks also cover @entity7 's top - secret ' means and methods ' of hunting enemies
