by @entity0 for more than four weeks , a streetlight has been blocking a turning lane in a busy @entity4 town , and there appears to be no rush to move it			1
this bizarre but frustrating tale began when the median strip was moved in the @entity10 suburb of @entity11 , in a bungled attempt to create a new turning lane			0
while the other lights have been moved , one straggler has been left standing alone in the middle of the street waiting for the green light to be moved			1
the pole has been standin in the @entity20 in @entity11 , for more than a month bungled road construction : the streetlight is bizarrely protruding out of the middle of the newly constructed turning lane on @entity11 , @entity11 it was hoped that the pole would be placed on the median strip , but it is instead stuck in the middle of a lane on @entity11 , @entity11 a phone call to the electricity distributor is the simple solution			1
a safety audit from the company contracted to create the new turning lane , @entity35 , is required before the street light can be moved back onto the median strip - a straight - forward but vital procedure			2
the electricity distributor responsible , @entity38 , say they are ready and waiting , but are yet to receive a call from @entity40			1
@entity38 spokesman @entity41 says the problem is that the developers did not do their homework before starting road constructions on @entity11			1
‘ at this stage @entity40 has not completed the required final audit and submitted it to @entity38			1
it is entirely in @entity40 ’s hands			0
’ the @entity38 website gives clear instructions for how to organise moving a street pole or street light motorists are unable to use the new turning lane as there is a giant streetlight stuck in the middle of it pictures show that the turning lane has been blocked off by a row of traffic posts , with the street pole dangerously placed in the middle of the lane			1
for a month the streetlight has been stuck in the middle of the lane on @entity11 , @entity11 the pole in question is owned by the @entity70 , which is building a new supermarket at nearby @entity72			1
@entity40 has been contracted by the @entity70 to create the new turning lane and relocate the poles			0
this has evidently not gone to plan			0
the pole was originally situated on a larger median strip , which has been made narrower to accommodate the turning lane , leaving the power pole in the @entity20			2
@entity38 ’s role is to ensure the pole complies with network safety audit requirements before it can be moved onto the median strip			2
the light is meant to sit on the new median street , but the developers have not contacted the electricity distributors so are unable to move the pole			1
@entity38 tried to take matters into their own hands , but @entity40 's involvement is crucial			2
' we sought advice from @entity93 on whether the pole could be moved onto the median strip but not connected to power , but @entity93 would not agree			0
‘ moving the pole before a safety audit means it could not have power connected to it or have power running through it to other lights which would disrupt power to a further 10 main road lights for some months			0
’ @entity103 , @entity104 , confirms @entity93 have nothing to do with the roadworks			0
' the current road works in the area are private developer funded works associated with access to new shopping centre that is currently under construction			2
these are not @entity93 works			0
' ' this lane remains closed to any traffic and @entity93 will only authorise the opening of the lane when all related road works and access to the new development are completed			0
' @entity40 could not be contacted for comment .			0

construction *mistake* leaves streetlight stuck in the middle of busy road
after more than a month no one has made any effort to fix the error
a phone call to electricity distributor is all that is needed to move the light
@entity38 are ' waiting by the phone ' but developers *ignore* the problem
