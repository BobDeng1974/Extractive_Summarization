under fire : the figures will put even more pressure on @entity4 chief executive sir @entity3 in the wake of the @entity7 scandal the @entity4 spent £ 15million in three years on gagging whistleblowers , the @entity8 can reveal today			1
the shocking figures pile the pressure on @entity4 chief executive sir @entity3 , who has clung to his £ 270,000 role despite presiding over the @entity7 hospital scandal that cost the lives of 1,200 patients			1
in just three years there were 598 ‘ special severance payments ’ , almost all of which carried draconian confidentiality clauses aimed at silencing whistleblowers			1
they cost the taxpayer £ 14.7million , the equivalent of almost 750 nurses ’ salaries			0
yet only last week , health secretary @entity27 warned the @entity4 against silencing internal dissent			0
he said for too long there had been a culture of celebrating success in the @entity4 , but ‘ not being honest about failure ’			0
he added : ‘ we must have a culture where people are not afraid to speak out			0
’ last night @entity36 , the @entity37 mp who uncovered the figures , demanded that sir @entity3 be recalled to give evidence to the influential commons public accounts committee to justify the £ 14.7million bill			1
the publication of the figures for the three years up until 2011 comes after a two - year battle by mr @entity36 , who is a member of the public accounts committee			2
the @entity47 and the @entity48 , which are notified of the cost of the agreements by the relevant @entity4 bodies , had steadfastly refused to publish the costs			1
the figures were finally released after mr @entity36 tabled a series of parliamentary questions			2
on three occasions , mr @entity36 raised concerns with sir @entity3 , a former card - carrying communist , about why whistleblowers were not being excluded from the confidentiality clauses			1
each time he was assured action had been taken			0
on the last occasion , at the public accounts committee meeting in september last year , sir @entity3 said : ‘ i thought we had done it			2
’ mr @entity36 , mp for @entity65 , has written to committee chairman @entity66 , demanding that sir @entity3 is recalled to discuss the use of gagging clauses across the @entity4			1
silenced : the ' special severance payments ' would stop whistleblowers speaking out if they saw poor treatment of patients such as that which occurred in @entity7 warning : just last week health secretary @entity27 warned the @entity4 against silencing internal dissent headlines : from monday 's @entity8 he told the @entity8 : ‘ there is a clear value - for - money implication here , both in ensuring the best possible outcomes in the health service , and the cost of the payments			1
' i am requesting the committee recalls sir @entity3 to examine the use of gagging clauses across the @entity4			1
‘ these gagging clauses are having a chilling effect on whistleblowers			0
it is shocking that over a three - year period an estimated 90 per cent of the 598 compromise agreements entered into by the @entity4 included gagging clauses			0
whistleblowers : both @entity96 , left , and @entity97 , right , were hounded out of their jobs for raising concerns with sir @entity3 ‘ it means that hundreds of potential whistleblowers may have been prevented from speaking out for fear of legal action , at a total cost to the taxpayer of almost £ 15million			2
sacked : heart surgeon @entity107 lost his job after speaking out about his hospital ‘ it begs the question : were @entity4 officials genuinely in the dark about the use of gagging clauses – in which case why were executives like sir @entity3 not aware it was going on ? – or were they actually the ones turning off the lights when the gag went on ? ‘ it is glaringly obvious that many @entity4 employees feel they are being silenced by non-disclosure clauses in their contracts			1
‘ it is now clear that a whistleblower who has reported concerns internally , but has not seen improvements take place , is induced , with taxpayers ’ money , to agree to sign away their rights to not take them any further			0
’ some of the highest ‘ special severance payouts ’ were at @entity134 , which paid £ 224,000 in 2011			2
@entity135 and @entity136 , which borders @entity7 , made payments of £ 90,000 , £ 190,000 and £ 35,000 in 2010/11			0
a @entity47 spokesman said the number of confidentiality clause payouts was falling sharply and that in 2011/12 , there were just 20 cases in @entity143 at a cost of just over £ 500,000			0
however , this figure did not include costs for the 105 @entity147 , which in 2010/11 racked up a bill of £ 2.5million on gagging clauses .			0

the figures pile more pressure on @entity4 boss sir @entity3
the ' special severance payments ' were made in three years up to 2011
the figures were released after questions from @entity37 mp @entity36
the @entity47 and @entity48 had refused to release the figure
