by the time you read this , somewhere out there an out - of - control satellite may have already crashed to @entity5			0
last night @entity6 was preparing for its research craft to re-enter our atmosphere at 4.30am			1
the six - ton satellite , which is the size of a bus , could hit any part of the globe – including @entity14 – hurling chunks of metal weighing up to 350lb across hundreds of miles			1
its 18,000 miles per hour descent was being tracked by @entity31 in @entity32			0
squadron leader @entity33 said they would be updating the @entity35 in @entity36 throughout the night and the government and emergency services were on standby if it appeared the @entity14 was under threat			0
the satellite ’s final destination will be known just two hours before impact and even then @entity6 will only be able to predict it to within the nearest 6,000 miles			1
an estimated 26 pieces – weighing a total of 1,200lb – are expected to survive re-entry into the atmosphere			1
incredibly , the plummeting satellite has been caught on film			0
@entity50 @entity22 's clip , shot in northern @entity51 , shows the 20 - year - old @entity23 ( @entity23 ) - launched in 1991 to examine the ozone layer - appearing as a beaming mass of light as it careers to @entity5			0
@entity6 orbital debris scientist @entity57 admitted : ‘ we know it is going to hit somewhere between 57 north and 57 south , which covers most of the inhabited world , unfortunately			1
’ how the satellite will fall to @entity5 danger : the six - ton @entity23 will crash to @entity5 and could land in @entity14 however , scientists have ruled out the @entity23 striking @entity67			1
its orbit was been altered by @entity6 deliberately to make it crash – but it is now coming down sooner than expected due to changed atmospheric conditions			1
it is falling to @entity5 at five miles per second , faster than previously thought and experts say there is a one in 3,200 chance of someone being hit by debris – more likely than getting a hole in one during a round of golf			2
the 35ft @entity6 craft , which weighs 6.5 tons , was put into space in 1991 to monitor climate change , and ceased operations in 2005			1
the falling satellite will look like a fiery meteor shower as it begins to burn up in the atmosphere			2
it is expected to break into more than 100 pieces with most of it being destroyed before it hits the ground			0
but around 26 pieces are expected to make it through and the heaviest metal parts are expected to reach @entity5 , including titanium fuel tanks			1
@entity6 spokesman @entity94 said : ‘ anybody who finds a piece of the satellite should stay away from it and call the police and let them deal with it			1
‘ it could be very hot or it could be dangerous			0
it depends on what speed the debris is going , but it could go be going fast enough to go through a house			0
‘ we will have to wait and see if the debris creates a crater			0
if it is spherical that is possible but if it has a less regular shape it may not be going so fast			0
’ mr @entity94 added that more accurate predictions are expected throughout today and will be posted on @entity6 ’s website			2
debris routinely falls to @entity5 from space but the @entity23 will be the biggest @entity6 craft to fall uncontrolled from space in 32 years			2
in 1979 @entity119 , which was 15 times bigger , rained charred chunks on the @entity121 and western @entity122 after @entity6 said it would land in @entity123			1
in 2003 when the space shuttle @entity127 exploded upon re-entry killing its entire crew , large chunks of its shell landed across @entity130			0

@entity50 : @entity22 captured the incredible footage in @entity134 , @entity51 on his @entity137 14in @entity136 telescope junk yard in space : @entity23 is one of the thousands of objects in @entity5 orbit being tracked by @entity6 , as shown by this computer graphic			2

it ran out of fuel in 2005 and @entity6 has no idea where it will crash land
@entity6 predicts it will re-enter our atmosphere at 4.30am
around 26 pieces will hit the *surface* , in pieces weighing up to *300* pounds
