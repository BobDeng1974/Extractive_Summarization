@entity0 could be stripped of even more powers under plans to create a new super-powerful @entity4 president who would not be directly elected by voters			1
a group of @entity7 have secretly devised a scheme to merge the jobs currently done by @entity10 , president of the @entity12 , and @entity13 , president of the @entity14			1
the new @entity16 chief would be in charge of both the administrative and political arms of the @entity4 and have sweeping control over the entire union			2
tight control : job would be merger of those currently done by @entity13 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) the @entity0 has been excluded from the covert discussions , which were were uncovered by @entity26 of @entity27			1
critics fear @entity29 is doing nothing to prevent the ominous plans , according to the @entity32			1
' this is a plot by people who want to abolish nation states and create a @entity36 of @entity16 , ' said lord @entity26			2
' the whole thing is barmy			2
these people are determined to achieve their final objective			0
@entity40 ? critics fear @entity29 is doing nothing to prevent the ominous plans ' the only hope for @entity0 is to leave the @entity4 and become an independent nation			1
' @entity47 backbench mp @entity45 said : ' it does n’t matter how you arrange the offices of these technocrats , they are useless at arranging our lives for us and they are not elected so they have no legitimacy			0
' former @entity57 premier mr @entity13 , was elected to his post by members of the @entity4 and is said to resent @entity60 mr @entity10 , who was chosen by the heads of ­ government of @entity4 member states			0
lord @entity26 warned that informal discussions within the @entity4 have a habit of rapidly being transferred into formal proposals			0
he confirmed the existence of the plot in the @entity69 by asking @entity71 ministers to reveal what they knew about the merger discussions			2
lord @entity74 pointed out that the holder of this new office would be both @entity16 ’s political and administrative leader , giving them even more powers than the @entity36 president			0
a @entity82 spokesperson said : ' as has been widely reported for a couple of months , the idea of merging the @entity14 and @entity12 presidencies has been informally discussed before			1
we believe that any proposal to merge these two offices would need treaty change and the @entity90 would not agree to such a proposal			0
' it would also mean a centralisation of power in @entity95 that would further weaken the @entity4 ’s legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens			0

role would be merger of jobs done by presidents of @entity12 and @entity14
lords call on @entity29 to make a stand
@entity108 *claims* it would mean the end of @entity0 as a nation
