rarely has cricket faced a tragedy quite like this			0
rarely can such a freak accident have devastated a whole sport and its followers worldwide			0
no - one should die playing a game of cricket			0
the passing of @entity9 is utterly devastating			1
the dangers of facing a hard ball propelled at anything up to 90 miles per hour are obvious , of course they are			2
we have all seen batsmen hit , most recently at @entity16 last summer when @entity17 took that nasty blow on the face from @entity20 that broke his nose			2
yet nobody can ever expect this			0
not the sight of a talented , highly popular international batsman receiving a blow from which he never recovered in the middle of an innings that was set to propel him back to the @entity31 test team			2
warning some pictures and video in this story may be distressing a tribute to @entity9 which circulated on @entity36 following his death at the age of 25 @entity9 has died aged 25 at @entity39 on thursday on cricket 's darkest day @entity9 signs autographs for young fans during a test match in @entity44 three years ago @entity9 hits the ball to the boundary on his way to a hundred against @entity48 in @entity49 back in 2009 @entity9 enjoys victory over @entity48 with his father @entity51 following his 2009 test debut at the wanderers @entity9 collapsed and hit the ground face first after being struck in the head by the bouncer @entity58 cricket captain @entity57 pauses before delivering a statement on thursday morning @entity57 was visibly upset during the press conference on thursday morning following the tragic news tests matches : 26 runs : 1,535 highest score : 160 average : 32.65 centuries : 3 half - centuries : 7 one - day internationals matches : 25 runs : 826 @entity72 score : 138 * average : 35.91 hundreds : 2 fifties : 4			1
twenty20 matches : 1 runs : 6 average : 6			0
first - class matches : 114 runs : 9,023 highest score : 243 * average : 46.51 hundreds : 26 fifties : 46 it is nobody ’s fault			0
certainly not poor young bowler @entity82 who , at 22 , had made his @entity31 @entity84 debut alongside @entity9 in @entity85 against @entity86 just a few short weeks ago			1
the bouncer he delivered to @entity9 was a routine delivery , a ball that 99 times out of 100 would either have been despatched to the boundary or avoided with ease by a player of the @entity31 ’s ability			1
the tragedy is that on the 100th occasion @entity9 was through with his shot too quickly and the ball hit him on an unprotected area at the back of his head			1
nor can any blame be attached to the manufacturer of the helmet @entity9 was wearing when he played his final innings in the fabled surroundings of the @entity107 , where so many legends of the game have performed			1
helmets will be improved , more protection will be given to the back of the head , but there is only so much safety equipment can do to lessen the risk of something as inconceivable as this happening			2
@entity9 ' tragic death was announced on thursday morning following his accident at the @entity107 @entity9 was a keen cricketer , even as a youngster in @entity120 ( left ) and as a professional sportsman the left hander celebrates reaching his century in a one - day international against @entity124 last year @entity9 ( second right ) celebrates with @entity125 after the leg - spinner took the wicket of @entity128 's @entity129 during the second @entity130 at @entity131 in 2013 @entity9 and @entity132 are applauded off the pitch at @entity134 by @entity128 during the @entity130 last year and cricket should not blame itself			1
there will be considerable soul searching , questions as to what changes can be made to make the game safer			0
is the ball too hard ? is there enough medical assistance provided at any cricket ground ? improvements can and will undoubtedly be made but the fact is , as @entity149 said here after the incident , it is 99.9 per cent certain nothing like this will ever happen again to any cricketer			0
this was a freak , an extremely rare occurrence according to the doctors of the @entity39 where @entity9 spent his last hours after being hit in a @entity159 match on tuesday plying his trade for his adopted state @entity58 against his old one in @entity162			1
it will take a long time for world cricket to recover from this			0
the game will go on , of course it will , but for the moment it is hard to see how @entity58 can play @entity171 in the first test in @entity173 next week			2
not when @entity9 was expected to replace the injured @entity57 and make his test comeback			2
the @entity175 have cancelled their two - day tour match against a @entity178 xi. @entity9 carves @entity179 through the covers during the first test of last summer 's @entity130 series @entity9 guides the ball through the off - side ( left ) and salutes a hundred against @entity48 in 2009 there will be an enormous shadow over next year ’s @entity188 in @entity58 too and an @entity130 series next summer that @entity9 would have been expected to play in			1
he had appeared in three of the greatest series of them all and seemed to have his best cricket ahead of him as he approached his 26th birthday			0
@entity9 was unquestionably a talent			2
a country boy from the part of @entity58 where @entity162 meets @entity197 , his unorthodox technique was honed in the backyard of the family home where any legside shots would have flown into the kitchen and incurred the wrath of his mother			1
so everything went through the offside and he initially took that somewhat rustic game into the test arena			0
what an impact he made too when he famously made 115 and 160 in only his second test against @entity48 in @entity212			0
a star was born and @entity31 cricket could look forward to enjoying a rare and exciting talent			0
@entity9 ( left ) , @entity216 ( centre ) and @entity218 celebrate beating the @entity219 in 2009 video @entity220 dies from head injuries there were ups and downs after that , there had to be with the way he played			1
he arrived in @entity128 for the 2009 ashes via a spell at @entity231 in a blaze of publicity but had his troubles against the short ball and had to work on his technique if he was to stay at the highest level of the game			1
he did so and was continuing to do so right up until the last			0
@entity9 went on to play 26 tests , earning a reputation as a fighter to overcome the games ’s ups and downs , and would have played his 27th at the @entity245 next week , probably after making a century in the innings that was devastatingly cut short when he moved on to an unbeaten 63 for @entity58 at the @entity107			1
@entity9 was rushed to @entity39 in the @entity107 suburb of @entity248 for surgery @entity250 , @entity125 and @entity251 arrived at @entity252 's to visit @entity9 on wednesday @entity125 , @entity253 and @entity251 leave @entity252 's hospital after visiting @entity9 on wednesday but more importantly than that he was , as @entity255 described him on thursday , ‘ one of the good guys			1
’ cricket is known for its companionship irrespective of nationality and @entity9 had many friends in @entity128 , not least from his spells in county cricket at @entity231 , @entity264 and @entity265			2
traditional @entity130 rivalry invariably begins and ends on the field			0
they will all be sharing the pain of the @entity9 family			2
as will anybody who has ever stepped on to a cricket field			0
@entity9 mother and sister went to watch him play a game of cricket on a lovely @entity107 day at a lovely ground on tuesday and saw their loved one taken from them in the cruellest way imaginable playing the game he loved far too prematurely			1
something like this is just not meant to happen			0
@entity250 walks away from @entity39 after visiting @entity9 , who had scans on wednesday morning former @entity58 cricketer @entity286 arrives at the hospital to visit @entity9 on wednesday the cricketing world has been showing its support for @entity9 , including former @entity58 fast bowler @entity286 @entity58 cricket captain @entity57 leaves @entity107 's @entity39 after visiting @entity9 @entity291 looks on at @entity39 as @entity9 is visited by fellow cricketers after his accident			1
