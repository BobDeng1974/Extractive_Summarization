as he greets the hordes of children in a town square outside @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , looks like your standard @entity7 , with a big white beard , ' bowl - full - of - jelly ' belly , round glasses and red robe and hat			1

i want to record it as if it were … @entity6 throughout the year as an artist is one person , but during these two months , i am the character of @entity7 , ' mr @entity6 said			1
looking upon mr @entity6 ' inked body , there is no mistaking his dedication to his role as @entity7			1
' i have reindeer here , here i have @entity7			2
i have a snowy background			0

all the same , this father of two says he understands why some people might hesitate to let their child sit on a tattoo - covered @entity7			2
