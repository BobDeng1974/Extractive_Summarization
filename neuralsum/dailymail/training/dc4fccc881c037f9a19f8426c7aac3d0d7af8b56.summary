hands off in the box is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box			1
whether it is wrestling , grappling , shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the @entity10 vs @entity12 match - the area has become a free - for - all for cheating			1
and that means fewer goals in the @entity16			2
for too long , referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring			2
it 's time to end that			1
so join us in our campaign to say @entity24 to players and referees			2
we ’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it			2
grappling and blocking in the box is the no 1 issue i am asked about by football people			2
it used to be foul language ( but it is seven years since a top - flight player was sent off for that offence ) and then goal - line technology ( but that ’s been dealt with effectively )			1
it is time to now deal with grappling and holding in the penalty area			1
tackling this issue is long overdue			2
it ’s not about a change in the law , it ’s about the appropriate enforcement of the law			2
grabbing , holding , grappling : however you describe it , is pure cheating			2
it ’s an issue that is preventing goals from being scored			0
i remember my @entity56 colleague @entity55 saying towards the end of his playing career : ‘ if referees gave it [ fouls for holding in the box ] , we would n’t do it			0
’ applying the law is an easy win for referees			0
they can not award a penalty if the ball is not in play , but they can issue a yellow card			1
@entity73 and @entity74 both appear to grapple @entity75 and @entity76 at a @entity12 corner giving a penalty is a massive thing for a referee , but interrupting the game before a corner or free - kick can be taken to issue a yellow card to culprits is easily enforceable			1
we already see referees prevent corners being taken so they can verbally warn players about holding and grappling			0
it ’s time for the talk to stop and the cards to come out			0
on sunday at @entity93 we saw @entity94 cautioned for removing his shirt after scoring a late equaliser			1
no - one blamed the referee			1
we need that same mental attitude here			0
this hands @entity104 campaign can successfully assimilate into the game yellow cards for holding in the box , so it ’s not something out of the ordinary			0
hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned – and sent off if you ’ve been booked already			0
once fans , managers and – crucially – players accept it as normal , this campaign will have achieved its aims			0
@entity118 was a master at it during his @entity12 days and @entity120 still does it for @entity122			1
he does n’t even look at the ball , his focus is entirely on holding his man , preventing him from reaching the ball and scoring the goal we all want to see			0
@entity129 does it for @entity131 , too			0
a direct free - kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences in a manner considered by the referee to be careless , reckless or using excessive force : kicks or attempts to kick an opponent trips or attempts to trip an opponent jumps at an opponent charges an opponent strikes or attempts to strike an opponent pushes an opponent tackles an opponent a penalty is awarded if an offence is committed by a player inside his own penalty area , irrespective of the position of the ball , provided it is in play			1
an indirect free - kick is also awarded to the opposing team if , in the opinion of the referee , a player : plays in a dangerous manner impedes the progress of an opponent prevents the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from his hands @entity73 appears to blatantly pull down @entity75 in the penalty area at @entity93 on sunday afternoon @entity75 falls to the ground after @entity73 dragged him down in the area by the @entity10 defender referee @entity174 should have awarded @entity12 a penalty during their draw at @entity93 the @entity12 defender appeals to @entity174 shortly after the incident in the @entity10 area @entity94 was rightly cautioned for taking off his shirt in celebration at @entity93 on sunday @entity120 was penalised last week for wrestling @entity183 striker @entity182 to the ground click here to read @entity187 's view on the wrestling in @entity10 's box on sunday			1
referees and their assistants can officiate tactically			0
the worst offenders of this holding practice are easily identified – i ’ve already mentioned @entity120 , but @entity73 was at it against @entity12 and @entity75 is no stranger to this dark art - and they can look out for them at the key moments during a game			1
blocking is a more difficult offence to determine			0
impending the progress of an opponent should be penalised by an indirect free - kick			1
grappling , shirt - pulling , holding and blocking are stains on the game and referees should apply the law when they see these offences			1
i ’ll be watching and detecting in all the big matches – starting at @entity212 tonight as @entity215 host @entity213			0
i will be naming and shaming the culprits and the referees who fail to hold them to account			0
and so will my @entity56 colleagues			0
@entity219 , you have been warned			0
the @entity122 captain ( pictured with @entity221 ) had n't seemed to have learned his lesson at @entity223 @entity131 defender @entity129 wrestles with @entity225 striker @entity224 at @entity226 in september 2012 @entity227 ( tussling with @entity228 in the @entity230 final ) was the master of the hold @entity232 reviewed the incident at half - time and show both @entity76 and @entity75 being held in the box @entity12 defenders @entity76 and @entity75 go to ground after they were held in the box like our @entity10 facebook page here .			1

@entity10 's draw against @entity12 filled with *controversy*
@entity73 and @entity74 appeared to headlock @entity76 and @entity75
@entity174 *missed* the incident in the first - half at @entity93
@entity120 is a serial offender in the penalty area
@entity118 was wily at impeding strikers while at @entity12
