@entity2 became so obsessed , she dressed herself in figure - hugging corsets , dyed her hair platinum blonde and even enhanced her breasts to a curvy @entity10			1
the style prompted a string of cruel comments from women who saw her as nothing more than a ‘ brainless bimbo ’			0
but miss @entity2 is living proof that appearances can be very deceptive			1
rather than being the ‘ stupid airhead ’ she is often labelled , she has a law degree and masters with distinction			1

but because i know i ’m not it makes me laugh			0
‘ people are pretty surprised when they find out that i have a masters degree			2
' i do n’t make a point in telling people but if they find out it ’s so funny to see their reaction			2

miss @entity2 , who also boasts 12 gcses and 3 a levels on her cv , began modelling herself on @entity6 because she was insecure about her own looks			2

' i also have bright pink lips for the @entity6 look or red for a more rock chick look			0
‘ but i do know for the majority of the time it is totally inappropriate to dress that way so i save it only for certain occasions			0
’ when it comes to studying , however , the serious side of her character comes through			0
‘ when i have exams , @entity56 goes away			0
there is a time and a place to be glamorous			0

' but for now i am trying my best to tone down the @entity6 within now i have my new job			2
’ miss @entity2 , from @entity79 , added : ‘ i have had girls say that they hate me because of the way i look and call me a slag or stupid or easy , but just because i look this way does n’t make me an idiot			1

on it she describes herself as a ‘ feminist , atheist and vegetarian ’ alongside choice quotations from @entity147 and @entity148 in support of her beliefs			0
