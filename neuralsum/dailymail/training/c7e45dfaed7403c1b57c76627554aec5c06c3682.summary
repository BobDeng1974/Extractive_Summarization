surgery tourists : almost a third of brits having cosmetic surgery are opting to go under the knife abroad a third of @entity2 who opt for cosmetic surgery such as boob jobs and face lifts now travel abroad to get it done on the cheap , according to a new study			2
the research suggests we have become a nation of cosmetic surgery tourists , with many seeking lower - cost elective procedures in @entity15			1
but , worryingly , more than half are unhappy with the results and one in five had to have further treatment back in @entity20 to correct problems			1
the @entity22 is the country of choice for breast enlargements with 19 per cent of women choosing to go there			2
meanwhile , almost one in five lip fillers and nose jobs are also carried out in the country			2
others travel even further afield with the research by @entity33 finding @entity34 is extremely popular among @entity2 seeking teeth - whitening procedures			1
more than a quarter of those getting their teeth done abroad ( 28 per cent ) head for the south - east @entity42 country			1
@entity43 was found to be the top destination for face - lifts ( 29 per cent ) , botox ( 28 per cent ) and liposuction ( 14 per cent )			1
the price comparison website discovered 30 per cent who have had cosmetic procedures travelled abroad			1
the main factor is the cheaper cost of surgery in other countries			1
treatment abroad : @entity43 is the country of choice for those wishing to undergo liposuction a quarter ( 25 per cent ) said they went overseas because they could nâ€™t afford to have the procedure done in the @entity20			0
others claim they opted for surgery abroad so they could combine it with a holiday at the same time ( 20 per cent )			0
but it seems it may be a false economy with a greater risk of botched operations			0
less than half were pleased with the results ( 46 per cent ) , and only 15 per cent would recommend others do the same			1
one in five who opted for a foreign cosmetic procedure ( 19 per cent ) had to have further treatments to correct a problem , compared to just 6 per cent who stayed in the @entity20			0
it seems other complications are more likely to affect those who go under the knife abroad , according to the survey of 1,559 cosmetic surgery patients			0
under the knife : the @entity22 is the country of choice for breast enlargements with 19 per cent of women choosing to go there a third claim to have caught an infection ( 33 per cent ) , whereas only 9 per cent say this happened after a procedure in the @entity20			0
many flock to overseas clinics they know have been visited by celebrities			0
the study found one in ten ( 10 per cent ) chose a clinic or surgeon because it had been used by a star			0
not satisfied : less than half of people having surgery abroad are unhappy with the results a similar number ( 11 per cent ) opted to use somewhere recommended by friends or family			1
despite the apparently heightened risks of heading abroad for procedures , only 14 per cent notified their doctor before travelling			1
@entity33 advise those travelling abroad for medical treatment should ensure they are adequately protected should the worst happen			0
yet only a third ( 33 per cent ) took out travel insurance , with even fewer notifying their existing insurer ( 29 per cent ) of their plans			0
@entity117 , @entity118 at @entity33 said : ' our research suggests cosmetic surgery tourism is now a popular trend among @entity2			0
' if consumers are tempted by a nip and tuck or a brighter smile at a smaller cost , we urge them to do their homework so their bargain treatment does not prove to be a costly mistake			1
' potential patients go overseas where prices are lower and procedures are more readily accessible			1
' however , it is clear there are increased risks associated with travelling abroad for cosmetic procedures			2
' those considering surgery or procedures abroad should ensure they are fully protected , because they could be left in the lurch if things go wrong			2
' notifying your doctor and ensuring you have adequate travel insurance is a must			0
' travellers should also be aware normal travel insurance might not cover them for all procedures abroad , so they need to be thorough when choosing the right policy for them			2

worryingly , more than half are unhappy with the surgical results
many are seeking lower - cost procedures particularly in eastern @entity15
