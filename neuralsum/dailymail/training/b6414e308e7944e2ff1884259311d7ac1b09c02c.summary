by @entity0 a toddler who was born after a 15 - year - old boy got his 13 - year - old sister pregnant is to be adopted , a high court judge has ruled			1
the two - year - old boy , who was born to the siblings in @entity6 in 2012 , will be put up for adoption after mr @entity8 agreed to a freeing order			1
sitting in the @entity11 in @entity12 , the judge ruled that the mother - who is now 16 - was incapable of giving consent for adoption herself			1
mr @entity8 's verdict came after he described the case as ' depressing ' and ' hugely unsatisfactory '			0
the hearing heard how both the mother and son , who can not be named for legal reasons , were taken into care after the birth but were sent to different foster homes			2
the mother was already known to social services due to previous concerns about her own mother , step - father and siblings			2
the judge said the mother , now 16 , was incapable of giving consent for adoption herself ( file picture ) ' none of this is her fault â€“ she is a victim of the way in which she was raised , ' the judge said			1
' it is hard to identify any positive life experience which she has enjoyed			0
' a report from a psychiatrist revealed ' in grim detail how miserable her life has been '			0
it stated : ' she is not in a position to fully understand the possible consequences of the various decisions which have to be made for herself and for the boy			0
' the freeing order came after local authorities sought to have the boy adopted for his best interests			1
in a judgement made public last week , mr @entity8 said : ' she is undoubtedly capable of making some decisions as is shown by some elements of the psychological assessment but not a decision which is of a magnitude and which has the consequences of the present one			0
' it appears to me that this finding on her competence undermines the proposition that she can be properly regarded as unreasonably withholding her agreement to adoption			0
' i am satisfied that the agreement of the mother to the making of an adoption order for the child should be dispensed with because she is incapable of giving her agreement			2
