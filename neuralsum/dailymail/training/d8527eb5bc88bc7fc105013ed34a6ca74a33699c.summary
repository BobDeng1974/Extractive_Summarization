three times a week , @entity0 sits on a small toilet in his home in a rural east @entity5 town and fires up his homemade dialysis machine			1
@entity0 , who suffers from kidney disease , made it from kitchen utensils and old medical instruments after he could no long afford hospital fees			1
he was a college student when he was diagnosed in 1993 with kidney disease , which means waste products can not be removed from his blood			0
he underwent dialysis treatment in hospital but ran out of savings after six years			2
his solution was to create his own machine to slash his costs			2
@entity0 uses his dialysis machine three times a week			1
he says it has kept him alive for 13 years ' the cost for each home treatment is only 60 yuan ( Â£ 6 ) , which is 12 per cent of the hospital charge for dialysis , ' @entity0 said			1
he said he was not deterred despite the fact two of his friends had died after building and using similar machines			1
the machine works like an external kidney			2
it is made up of two compartments that are connected by a membrane ( a film - like structure that allows only some particles to pass through it )			0
blood is pumped through one half of the machine , while the dialysis fluid is pumped through the other half			2
@entity0 makes the dialysis fluid by mixing potassium chloride , sodium chloride and sodium hydrogen carbonate ( bicarbonate ) into purified water			1
for the treatment , he inserts two tubes into his arm , which are connected to his dialysis machine			2
the blood is pumped out of his arm through one of the tubes , is filtered and then returned to his body via the other tube			0
@entity0 bought disused medical equipment , such as a blood pump and plastic tubing @entity0 prepares his machine			1
he says his nearest public hospital is too crowded and too far away @entity0 's kidney disease means he has dangerously high levels of the minerals potassium and sodium in his blood			1
so he created a dialysis solution that has similar levels of potassium and sodium to healthy human blood			0
when the blood and dialysis fluid go through the machine , these excess minerals are encouraged to go from his blood and through the membrane to the fluid			0
this removes the waste products from his blood - and the fluid is later thrown away			0
this spontaneous movement of particles from a high to a low concentration through a membrane is known as diffusion			0
the ' clean ' blood is then pumped back into his body			0
bottles of homemade dialysis fluid , a pan for mixing and scales that @entity0 uses for his rough and ready treatment @entity0 's condition also means he has high levels of acid in his bodily fluids			1
this can be dealt with by putting bicarbonate back into his body			0
in this case , particles from the fluid pass the other way through the membrane from the fluid into the blood , ready to go back into his body			0
doctors warn that @entity0 runs the risk of serious infection as well as long - term complications by not using sterile water to make the fluid			1
but @entity0 , who lives with his 81 - year - old mother in @entity115 township of @entity116 , says he has limited options			2
@entity0 was offered medical aid by the government when his story sparked national interest thanks to report in the @entity122			1
the funds would would bring the cost of hospital treatment down to the same level as his home treatment			0
however , @entity0 said he was reluctant to switch as the nearest hospital is far away and very crowded			1
although a @entity130 country , @entity5 does not have a cradle - to - grave free - at - the - point of use healthcare system			0
instead around half of the population buy basic medical insurance which covers for half the costs of their healthcare			0
the remainder is paid either by patients or their health insurer			0
however , this leaves the poorest in @entity5 struggling to meet medical bills for serious conditions			2
hygiene issues : @entity0 's machine is in his bathroom by his toilet			1

@entity0 built his machine after he could no longer afford hospital bills
he said two of his friends had died after building and using similar machines
offered @entity158 medical aid after story went national , but says nearest hospital is too far away and too crowded
