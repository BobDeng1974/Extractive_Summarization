my age of anxiety by @entity3 think you ’re one of life ’s worriers ? step aside for @entity3			1
as the editor of one of the world ’s most prestigious magazines , the @entity12 , he is an alpha male in real life , but in the world of anxiety , he ’s the alpha ’s alpha			1
he says he is ‘ buffeted by worry ’			2
on ordinary days , doing ordinary things , he is regularly stricken by ‘ a pervasive sense of existential dread ’			2
he is overwhelmed by nausea and vertigo , stomach aches and headaches			2
he starts to shake uncontrollably			2
he sweats to the point of dehydration			0
occasionally , as when his wife was giving birth to their first child , he passes out			0
he has some phobias too			0
enclosed spaces ( claustrophobia )			0
being trapped far from home ( a species of agoraphobia )			0
speaking in public ( a sub-category of social phobia )			0
and , of course , vomiting on aeroplanes ( aeronausiphobia )			0
he has tried everything : every imaginable type of therapy , meditation , acupuncture , yoga , alcohol and 27 named drugs			0
think you ’re one of life ’s worriers ? step aside for @entity3 ( right )			1
as the editor of a prestigious magazine he is an alpha male in real life , but in the world of anxiety , he ’s the alpha ’s alpha none of it has made any difference			1
so , as a last resort , it seems , he has written about his anxiety			1
his therapist , dr w , thinks it might work			0
or at least , he tells @entity3 he thinks it might work			1
this is a big shambling splurge of a book , partly a quasi-academic history of the subject , partly a scientific investigation , and partly a record of @entity3 ’s own extreme fretfulness			1
we are , he says , more anxious than ever before , and : ‘ though some have argued that anxiety is a particularly @entity91 affliction , it ’s not just @entity91 who suffer from it			1
’ according to one report , 15 per cent of @entity94 suffer from an anxiety disorder of some kind , and 37 per cent of us say we are more frightened than we used to be			1
the world is going mad with worry			1
it ’s not new , though			1
in the fourth century @entity101 recorded that one of his patients was terrified of cats			0
rather later , @entity106 used his acute fear of trains to construct his theory of psychoanalysis , while @entity111 was housebound by stress - related illnesses after the @entity114			0
according to one report , 15 per cent of @entity94 suffer from an anxiety disorder of some kind , and 37 per cent of us say we are more frightened than we used to be but what is anxiety exactly ? how do we distinguish it from full - blooded depression ? @entity3 likes his therapist ’s definition , and so do i. ‘ anxiety , ’ writes dr w , ‘ is apprehension about future suffering — the fearful anticipation of an unbearable catastrophe one is helpless to prevent			1
’ for dr w , the defining characteristic of anxiety is that it ’s geared towards the future			1
animals have no abstract concept of the future : they can experience fear , but not anxiety			2
in the @entity91 , of course , mental health is a multi-billion - dollar industry			0
anxiety has become a battleground between the big pharamaceutical corporations , which seek to medicate everyone with highly profitable drugs , and the traditional holistic approach of therapists , who argue that merely talking about it will do far more good			2
at the heart of all this is an old , old argument : is nature or nurture to blame ? are we genetically programmed to become anxious , or did our upbringing give us all the lessons we needed ? the actor @entity155 could not bear to be in the same room as honey , even if it was sealed in a jar , even if the jar was shut in a drawer not wishing to blame his parents , @entity3 seems drawn to the genetic argument , but he acknowledges that the true answer is six of one , half a dozen of the other			1
his own story is really something , though			0
@entity3 has a pathological fear of vomiting , even though the last time he threw up was march 17 , 1977			1
an astonishing proportion of his life since has been spent trying to avoid being sick and preparing for the eventuality that he might			2
@entity3 is a pro. he steals sickbags from aircraft and stashes them all over his home , car and office , just in case			1
he carries anti-emetic medication everywhere he goes			0
and , ‘ like a general monitoring the enemy ’s advance ’ , he keeps a detailed mental map of incidences of norovirus and other stomach bugs , using the internet to track outbreaks all over the world			1
one day he complains to his father that there is no central clearing house for information about norovirus outbreaks the way there is for influenza			0
‘ yes there is , ’ interjects his wife			0
’ my @entity200 also teems with glorious stories			0
( the actor @entity155 could not bear to be in the same room as honey , even if it was sealed in a jar , even if the jar was shut in a drawer			0
) it ’s a book so deranged in its intensity , you end up feeling remarkably sane and well - adjusted .			2
