doctors are being told to stop giving aspirin to patients who have a common heart condition that carries a high risk of stroke – as the drug does n’t work			1
but there are fears many @entity9 will still prescribe it for the condition , because they will continue to be paid to do so			2
doctors are funded for prescribing aspirin to patients with atrial fibrillation ( @entity16 ) , a type of irregular heartbeat , until april 2015			1
@entity16 sufferer @entity19 , 65 , a postmaster from @entity21 , has already moved on to warfarin – though a hospital cardiologist prescribed him aspirin and beta - blockers after a prolonged attack only then will the @entity28 payment rules change			1
the decision will mean that 300,000 people currently prescribed aspirin for @entity16 will have to be put on other blood - thinning drugs , including newer more expensive medicines			1
cardiologist professor @entity34 , of @entity35 , said last night : ‘ this is a seismic shift in the guidelines and will have a huge impact on practice			0
‘ there are a great many patients with atrial fibrillation who are taking aspirin to prevent stroke and thinking it is doing a great job			1
‘ they need to go and see their doctor to discuss all the effective alternatives available			0
’ millions of people across @entity51 take an aspirin a day believing it will reduce their risk of stroke , heart attack or cancer			1
the pill has been handed out for years to people with @entity16 , which raises the risk of stroke fivefold			1
it affects up to 1.2 million in @entity51			0
the decision to restrict its use has been taken by a review panel at the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , which publishes guidelines on @entity28 drugs			0
the panel said that while aspirin might cut the risk of blood clot - induced strokes a little , that benefit is all but cancelled out by the increased risk of intestinal bleeding and ‘ brain - bleed ’ strokes			2
the @entity66 guidance concludes : ‘ do not offer aspirin monotherapy solely for stroke prevention to patients with @entity16 ’ despite the concerns about the continued prescribing of aspirin for @entity16 , @entity86 , the deputy chief executive of the @entity87 , said that the charity was ‘ over the moon ’ about the recommendation , set to be published on june 18			1
she added : ‘ this gives clinicians and patients a mandate to assess patients using the best tools , knowing the options for treatment that will protect them			0
’ she urged people with @entity16 not to stop taking aspirin before seeing their gp , as they might also have been prescribed it for another valid reason			1
the recommendation will see more people being put on warfarin , which has been used as a blood thinner for over 50 years and halves the risk of stroke , or more expensive alternatives			2
while warfarin is an inexpensive drug and proven to work , getting the dose right can be tricky			0
patients must go for regular blood tests to ensure they are ‘ in range ’			0
too high a dose can result in dangerous internal bleeds			0
under the guidelines , patients must be made aware of newer drugs such as @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , which are claimed to be at least as effective as warfarin but with fewer side effects			0
however , they cost about £ 2 a day compared with pennies for warfarin			0
@entity16 sufferer @entity19 , 65 , a postmaster from @entity21 , has already moved on to warfarin – though a hospital cardiologist prescribed him aspirin and beta - blockers after a prolonged attack			1
he said : ‘ i ’d read a lot about @entity16 on various websites and knew that aspirin did not protect against stroke			2
‘ three weeks later i managed to get an appointment with my gp to try to get my prescription changed			0
he agreed and said i could go on warfarin straight away			0
' i was shocked that the cardiologist had not known that aspirin does not guard against strokes in an @entity16 patient and that i , as the patient , knew more than him			2
’ according to the @entity146 , @entity16 is linked to about one in six strokes – or more than 22,500 a year			1
if all people with @entity16 received the best treatment available , around 7,000 strokes a year and 2,000 deaths would be prevented .			2
