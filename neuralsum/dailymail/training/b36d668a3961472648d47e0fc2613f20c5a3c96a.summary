by @entity0 published : 19:22 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 06:21 est , 8 january 2014 police should mount patrols at polling stations in 16 towns and cities to combat vote - rigging , @entity8 ’s elections watchdog warns today			1
the @entity10 has identified a list of areas considered ‘ vulnerable ’ to voting fraud			1
the at - risk areas include @entity8 ’s second city @entity16 , the scene of a notorious ballot - rigging case in 2004 which the presiding judge said would ‘ disgrace a banana republic ’			1
election : police should mount patrols at polling stations in 16 towns and cities to combat vote - rigging , @entity8 's elections watchdog warns today many of the areas identified have large south @entity31 communities , but the watchdog says it would be a ‘ mistake ’ to think electoral fraud only takes place within them			1
it warns , however , there is particular concern at the ‘ vulnerability of some @entity31 communities , specifically those with roots in parts of @entity45 or @entity46 , to electoral fraud ’			1
it goes on : ‘ the evidence and views we have heard raise significant questions about whether individuals within these communities are able effectively to exercise their right to vote , and whether they are able to participate in elections on the same basis as other electors across the @entity8			1
’ the watchdog says it is also commissioning more work into voting fraud within the @entity31 community			1
concerns include whether men pressure their wives and children to vote in a particular way			2
the @entity10 has identified a list of areas considered ' vulnerable ' to voting fraud ( file picture ) today ’s report calls for increased police involvement in elections in 16 parts of @entity76			1
as well as @entity16 , they include : @entity78 with @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , and @entity93			2
all 16 areas have a history of alleged voting fraud			0
at one point the @entity10 considered a total ban on postal voting in these areas in order to combat fraud			1
but , following a public consultation , it decided this would unfairly hit many ordinary people who need to vote by post			0
instead it has urged the police to mount patrols at polling stations during future elections in the 16 named areas and target more resources at investigating allegations of electoral fraud , which critics complain have been a low priority for the police			0
returning officers have also been urged to take ‘ sustained action ’ to identify suspect patterns of voting and voter registration			2
the report also calls for voters to be required to show photo id at polling stations			0
and it calls for political parties to be banned from handling postal ballots under any circumstances			0
the watchdog says it will call for a change in the law to ban political activists from handling postal ballots if they refuse to comply with a new code of conduct			0
@entity139 mp @entity138 , who has campaigned for action to tackle vote - rigging , welcomed the report but said further action was needed			0
‘ greater involvement of the police would be welcome because intimidation is an issue – i am aware of incidents of polling clerks being intimidated into handing over ballot papers to party representatives			0
‘ the whole issue of what happens in polling stations needs more attention			0
i would like to see filming inside polling stations , not of how people vote , but of what else goes on			0
’ overall , the commission found electoral fraud was ‘ not widespread ’ , but added : ‘ despite this , a significant proportion of the public remain concerned that it is taking place			2
