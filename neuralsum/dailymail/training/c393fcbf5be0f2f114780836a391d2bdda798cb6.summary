by @entity0 published : 12:46 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 01:57 est , 25 october 2012 @entity1 , pictured outside court , is arguing that her seven - year marriage was valid when a couple divorce , a row over who gets the family home , pets or even the record collection is to be expected			1
but for @entity1 and her billionaire ex-husband @entity11 , the stakes are a little higher			2
she claims he has breached their divorce settlement by failing to maintain her two luxury homes , cutting her number of servants and refusing to pay her head chef ’s salary			1
now she is demanding her @entity21 ex increases her maintenance payments , improves their £ 5million @entity24 mansion and replaces her fleet of cars every three years			0
mr @entity11 , 66 , married mrs @entity1 , 47 , at @entity24 ’s @entity27 in 1994 in an @entity29 ceremony presided over by an imam			1
they were together for seven years and had three children but the relationship broke down in 2001 , leading to acrimonious divorce proceedings			0
their differences appeared to have been resolved by a ‘ compromise ’ hammered out in 2002 , which made financial provision for mrs @entity1			2
it also guaranteed her home in @entity42 , @entity21 , would be well maintained , allowed her the run of the couple ’s @entity46 mansion in the summer and agreed some of her staff costs would be paid			0
the luxurious @entity46 property that mrs @entity1 uses when in @entity24 but the @entity52 heard a list of complaints from mrs @entity1 including claims mr @entity11 had not dealt with septic tank leaks or maintained the air conditioning at her @entity42 home			1
she also claims he refused to pay the salaries of the house ’s watchman and head chef and cut the assistant chef ’s pay and the number of housemaids			0
@entity66 , for mrs @entity1 , said her ex-husband was ‘ enormously wealthy ’ although the true scale of his riches had never been probed			2
he added that she had estimated her husband ’s wealth , from his thriving @entity21 business empire , as anywhere between £ 100m and £ 1billion in 2001			0
their dispute hinges on mr @entity11 ’s claims that both their @entity29 marriage and divorce were invalid under @entity80 law , which he says means @entity80 courts have no business intervening in their affairs			1
but a family judge rejected this claim in march this year			0
mrs @entity1 says her marriage ended in march 2002 when her husband ‘ pronounced talaq ’ , the equivalent of divorce proceedings under @entity29 law			1
but @entity92 , for mr @entity11 , said their wedding could not be recognised because he was already married at the time under @entity29 law and therefore the talaq dissolving it was also void			1
in effect , there was ‘ never a marriage ’ , he claimed			0
mr @entity99 said mrs @entity1 was not trying to get a bigger slice of her ex-husband ’s fortune but was trying to ‘ regularise ’ her position			2
the three judges hearing the case have now reserved their decision until a later date .			0

@entity1 argues that her husband @entity11 has failed to keep his side of the bargain in their divorce settlement
but he claims they were never lawfully married in @entity80 as he already had a wife under @entity29 law
he therefore *believes* their dispute is *private* and nothing to do with the courts
judges ruled their marriage was valid , but the father has now taken his case it to the @entity52
