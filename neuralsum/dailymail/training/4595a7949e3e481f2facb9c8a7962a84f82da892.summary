by @entity0 a young woman is hoping surgeons can save her sight after her left eyeball ' exploded '			2
it 's the second time @entity6 has suffered a split cornea , which caused her optical fluid to dribble out of her eye			1
the first time was during a driving lesson two years ago			1
@entity6 , 28 , said : ' i knew i had a condition called keratoconus ( a bulging of the cornea ) because my mother had it and my brother has it			1
' but what i had , where the cornea split , is called hydrops			1
my case was so extreme that it has been written about in a medical journal			0
' @entity6 is currently resting her eye ahead of surgery that doctors hope will stop her eye from splitting open again beneath the bandage , @entity6 's left eye is resting ahead of a procedure where a sample of human cornea will be implanted in the hope it will prevent the thin tissue from breaking open and blinding her			1
speaking from her parents ' home in @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity6 , a barmaid and artist , said : ' it first happened when i was on a driving lesson in 2010			1
i felt a very sharp pain in my eye			2
' i was n't sure if something had got in like a piece of grit , or if it was a very severe allergic reaction			0
' @entity51 started running down my face			0
i thought it was my eyes watering , but it turned out it was the optical fluid in the eyeball			1
i could n't lift my eyelid			0
' a healthy eye and one with keratoconus fortunately , the driving instructor took over the controls , bringing her safely home and she was rushed to the doctor by her parents			1
@entity6 said : ' i had no idea what it was at all			1
we were told to go immediately to @entity70			0
' i was given anaesthetic eye drops , but there was n't a great deal the staff could do for me			2
' the consultant decided to apply an optical bandage , which wrapped around a lot of my eyeball to protect it and to stop any more fluid weeping out , as my eyeball was basically deflating			1
' under the pressure of the escaping liquid , @entity6 's iris had actually moved to block the gap and was bulging out of the front of her eye			1
there were fears her optic nerve would be dangerously exposed			0
she was put on @entity91 , a drug used by high - altitude mountain climbers to prevent pulmonary oedemas , to equalise the pressure in her eyeball			2
her case was deemed so severe it was discussed in a conference of optical specialists at the now - relocated @entity101 eye hospital			1
@entity6 , who now lives in @entity102 , said : ' if the optical nerve had contacted anything at the back of my eye , it would 've been game over			1
' but , fortunately the drugs and bandage started to work			0
there was a lot of scarring on the eye , but i was able to get on with my life			2
then , two years later , it happened again			0
' she went to bed on @entity120 night with an itchy eye socket			2
although the sensation was driving her crazy , she thought it was just a bit drier than usual			2
around 30,000 people in the @entity126 suffer from keratoconus , where the cornea becomes stretched and thin near its centre			1
the thinned part of the cornea bulges , distorting eyesight			2
around 500 people a year undergo a corneal transplant due to the condition			1
@entity136 is a rare complication of keratoconus , affecting around 2 per cent of people			2
a split in the cornea causes fluid to escape , creating mistiness or temporary loss of sight in the eye			1
the eye eventually recovers with the help of steroid drops but this can take many months			2
a scar is left behind , which can affect sight if it is over the eye 's centre			1
instead , the following day she suffered a short sharp pain , violently flashing blue lights and , once again , the fluid started flowing			0
she said : ' i thought ' no , this ca n't be happening again '			0
the light was unbearable , it was like a welding torch			0
' my mother took me to hospital - to @entity164 as @entity101 , in @entity165 , has since closed down - and we were sent on to @entity167			0
' it was the same process - the drops , the bandage			0
i was told there and then that it looked like it would have to be a transplant , as it would happen over and over until i eventually lost my sight			0
' i knew i could n't go through life with this happening every so often , and this was a particularly nasty case			0
' an example of hydrops , when a split on the cornea causes the optical fluid to escape now , with a provisional date for the operation in two weeks ' time , @entity6 is grimly practical about the procedure			1
she said : ' it will be a general anaesthetic job , pretty full on			0
i do n't think i 've got any strong feelings - it 's a case of this thing is happening , and i 've got to get my head round it			1
' @entity6 , with her limited vision and tired from a combination of pain and medication , she is currently unable to paint or work			1
but she has a positive example in her mother @entity203 , who successfully underwent the operation a few years ago			0
@entity203 , 63 , of @entity39 , said : ' i was diagnosed with keratoconus from 18 , and i recently had the corneal transplant			0
' it worked for me - although it does n't work for everybody because your body can reject the implant			0
i wear contact lenses but now i can manage without			0
it 's been a success and , unless i do reject it , it 's there for good			0
and it hopefully will work for @entity6 too			1
' for more information : @entity219			0

@entity6 's eye burst during a driving lesson when her cornea split
28 - year - old nearly went blind after optical fluid *leaked* out of left eye
