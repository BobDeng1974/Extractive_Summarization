not having it : @entity1 , left , responded to travellers moving on to his land by leaping into his digger and threatening to move them by force when he found travellers ’ caravans had arrived on his land , @entity1 had two options			1
he could either alert the authorities and wait for the slow turning of the wheels of justice and officialdom			0
or he could rely on the somewhat quicker wheels of his digger – and remove the caravans by force			1
taking the second course of action , mr @entity1 put in a call to the police to inform them of his intentions , which risked leading to his arrest			1
officers arrived to oversee what appeared to be a few heated exchanges before – remarkably – the travellers left of their own accord			1
his swift action stands in stark contrast to the decade - long battle to shift travellers from the notorious @entity35 site in @entity36 , which only came to an end in october last year			2
mr @entity1 , whose farm is near @entity39 in @entity40 , discovered the intruders early yesterday morning			1
‘ i would have used any force possible to get them off my land , ’ he said			2
‘ i got down here about 6am and told them to move off			0
there were four vans there at the time and more parked up outside			0
‘ i came down with the digger and tractor and told them if they did n’t move i was going to move them			0
‘ i just wo n’t tolerate it			1
i bought it and i have worked hard for it			0
i called the police and told them i was going to get the digger and move them			2
‘ i did n’t care if they got squashed , flattened or left on their own , but one way or another i was going to get them off my land			2
’ ' it 's my land ' : undeterred by the sudden arrival of the travellers , mr @entity1 called police and told them he was prepared to remove the intruders by force ' i would have used any force possible ' : officers were forced to stand between mr @entity1 's digger and the travellers ' caravans to prevent him from carrying out his threats it is believed that the went to @entity83 , @entity40 , three miles from mr @entity1 's land he said that at one point in the clash the officers had to stand between the two sides			1
‘ the police told me that once they are on the land they have rights			2
but what about my rights ? ’ mr @entity1 added			1
‘ if i had left it to the authorities they could have been on my land for weeks			2
i was n’t going to wait for a court order to get rid of them			0
‘ as it was , the police threatened to arrest me			1
it has already cost me a day ’s work and about £ 500 to repair the damage			0
they cut through a metal gate and put their own lock on it			0
’ a spokesman for @entity108 said : ‘ six caravans turned up on land at 6.45am			0
the landowner also turned up and threatened to evict the travellers			1
furious : officers oversaw what appeared to be several heated exchanges between mr @entity1 and his uninvited guests a traveller talks to officers : mr @entity1 feared that if he left the eviction to the authorities , the caravans could have been left on his land for weeks ‘ police attended and remained on scene to prevent a breach of peace			1
the travellers left the site of their own accord at 9.35am			1
’ removing travellers who have occupied land without permission is usually a much more costly and time - consuming exercise			0
at @entity35 , the decade - long legal battle cost taxpayers an estimated £ 18million			0
a total of 43 people were arrested and several injured after protesters fought running battles with riot police over the eviction of about 80 families from what was the @entity144 ’s largest illegal traveller settlement			0
as soon as @entity147 council had declared a final victory , there was a massive leap in the number of caravans pitched on the legal @entity153 site next door – and an adjoining road – prompting more expensive legal action			0
in 2009 , a convoy pitched up at another controversial travellers ’ site just hours after a group had been evicted following a six - year legal battle costing £ 400,000			2
the new arrivals rolled on to a field adjoining the notorious @entity165 site at @entity166 , @entity167 , where travellers had set up an illegal camp			0
bye bye : the travellers eventually moved off mr @entity1 's land at 9.45am - three hours after they had arrived			1

@entity1 threatened to remove travellers by force himself after declaring : ' i wo *n't* tolerate it . '
police say travellers left of their own accord in two hours 50 minutes after mr @entity1 's *intervention*
