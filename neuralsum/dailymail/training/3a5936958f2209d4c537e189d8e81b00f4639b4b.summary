if trekking the @entity0 or taking in the breathtaking views of the @entity2 make an appearance on you bucket list , you are not alone			1
a new survey suggests that far from being couch potatoes as we 're often portrayed , the @entity7 are really rather an adventurous bunch			1
at least in theory ... figures from the @entity12 reveal that 40 per cent of @entity14 dream of making a pilgrimage to @entity0 , which stretches for an incredible 5,500 miles across north of the country , while just over a third of people claim that visiting the @entity2 in @entity19 tops their list of dream destinations			1
the @entity0 is top of the bucket list for around 40 per cent of adventurous @entity14 it may not actually be a canyon , but the @entity2 in @entity19 is stunning a quarter of @entity7 say that trekking the @entity28 trail is top of the dream destinations and we 're not afraid to strap on our walking boots either			1
trekking the famous @entity33 in @entity34 to reach the 15th - century ruins at @entity36 comes in at number three on the list , with a quarter of people claiming it is their most aspirational adventure			1
this is closely followed by 21 per cent of @entity14 who say they dream of walking the length of the mighty @entity43			0
and it appears that we 're a fearless lot , as well			0
around 17 per cent of those polled said they dream of diving with great white sharks , and a further 15 per cent are willing to risk life and limb ( and maybe the odd finger tip ) to climb to the summit of @entity54			0
you looking at me ? forget dolphins , 17 per cent of @entity14 say they want to dive with great white sharks skydiving over the @entity59 in @entity60 makes number seven on the list 1.walking along the @entity0 - 40 % 2			1

walking the @entity43 - 21 % 5			2
diving with great white sharks - 17 % 6			2
hiking the great @entity64 , @entity65 - 17 % 7			2
skydiving over the @entity59 - 16 % 8			0
climbing the summit of @entity54 -15 % 9			0
expedition across the @entity68 - 13 % 10			0
white water rafting down the @entity70 in @entity71 -10 % but while men are more interested in water - based adventures , such as white water rafting down the @entity70 in @entity71 , or sailing solo across the @entity77 , women prefer to keep their feet firmly on the ground			1
the female of the species is just as adventurous as their male counterparts but , according to the figures , they 'd rather walk their way around the world , visiting the @entity86 's in @entity65 and trekking through @entity87			0
in reality , however , many of us will be staying a little closer to home during 2015			0
a separate survey by comparison website @entity93 suggests that just under a third of @entity14 will be opting for a staycation this year			0
skydiving over the @entity59 will just have to wait ... while 32 per cent of @entity14 will opt for a staycation this year , 13 per cent of us still dream of trekking across the @entity68 around 15 per cent of @entity7 say that climbing to the summit of @entity54 tops their bucket list			1

40 % of @entity7 dream of making a pilgrimage to @entity0
men more interested in water - based activities , women in walks and treks
but a third of people in the @entity7 will be opting for a ' staycation ' for 2015
