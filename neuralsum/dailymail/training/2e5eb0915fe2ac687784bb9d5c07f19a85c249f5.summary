another week , another photoshoot ! although my work can get pretty hectic at times , i do love being on the go , and i was particularly excited for this shoot as it was for my nail polish range @entity7			1
as summer is sadly on the way out , i 've been thinking about launching my @entity11 shades soon , replacing cute pastels and beachy brights with deep berry hues , neutral greys and smouldering metallics			1
the new collection will be out very soon so keep an eye out ! for the shoot , i enlisted the slick skills of expert make - up artist @entity21 , who was responsible for the super-glam look i wore in @entity23 's @entity25 music video			1
i was delighted with the results , so thought i 'd share with you how he did it : the face a foundation with good coverage is a photoshoot essential , so @entity21 began by applying @entity48 to my face with the @entity50 , buffing and blending so the product merged seamlessly with my skin			1
after setting the base with powder , @entity21 used the classic @entity55 to define my cheekbones and warm up my face			1
hold on to summer : @entity29 wanted to soak up the last of the sun with her bronzed babe look the eyes for the shoot , @entity21 put a summery twist on my all - time beauty fave , the smokey eye			1
instead of using harsh greys and blacks , he opted for warmer golden , coppery tones , using the gorgeous @entity69 6 @entity68 in @entity70			1
he swept a light base colour all over my lid , before taking a warm brown colour across my lash line , winging it slightly towards the end			2
next , he took the shimmery copper shade and lightly patted it all over my lash line , again focusing on the outer corners			2
the perfect smokey eye presents a sexy , slightly ' worn - in ' look , so there 's no need to be too precise with application			2
do make sure you blend each new shade into the eye well with a blending brush , though , to avoid the result looking patchy			2
finally , @entity21 lined my upper and lower lash lines with the @entity89 in @entity90 , smudging the product in slightly with a small eye brush			2
@entity93 of @entity94 finished off the eyes			0
diet success : @entity29 said that she was feeling body confident on the shoot following her recent weight loss the lips @entity21 lined my lips first with the @entity103 in @entity104 , applying the pencil in gentle brush strokes just outside the lip line to create the illusion of fuller lips			0
he then filled my lips in with @entity110 in @entity111 – a slightly lighter shade – for a structured yet natural looking pout			0
the body i was feeling pretty body confident before the shoot – i did indulge slightly in @entity116 ( i 'm only human ! ) but managed to keep my dieting under control by taking @entity119 every day , so was more than happy to get my pins out on the day			0
@entity21 applied @entity121 over my arms , legs and décolletage using a body brush for an all - over beach babe bronzed glow			0
as a final touch , he spritzed some of the @entity130 down the front of my legs and along my collarbones			0
this luxurious oil gives the body a luminous , subtle shimmer , enveloping it with its gorgeous orange and jasmine flower scent			0
you can get all the products buster used on the shoot , as well as my @entity34 nail polishes , from @entity143			1
smooth operator : @entity29 recommends using a dry oil to make legs shimmer while the sun 's still out i also wanted share with you some exciting news about the @entity151			1
it 's @entity151 's third global anniversary , so to celebrate three years providing luxury treats to beauty junkies like me worldwide , they 've given their iconic pink box a subtle makeover and filled it with some super special goodies including a bespoke @entity158 created exclusively for @entity151 ! treasure chest : as a beauty junkie , @entity29 ca n't get enough of @entity151 my top pick from the @entity163 has to be @entity164 – this hair mask is a complete godsend , giving dry , lifeless hair lustrous strength and shine			1
i leave it on overnight before shampooing and conditioning my hair as normal the next morning			0
i also adore the @entity174 fragrance – a must if you 're a fan of soft , floral scents , plus the handy size makes it perfect to take on a night out			0
you can get your mitts on the @entity183 for just £ 10 ( + @entity184 ) from www.glossybox.co.uk throughout the whole of august 2014			0
until next time , @entity29 xxx			0
