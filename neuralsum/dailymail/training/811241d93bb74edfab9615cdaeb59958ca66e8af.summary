all the challenges for @entity1 were overcome well before he arrived in @entity2 on sunday evening to be crowned @entity4 winner			1
traditionally a sprinters ’ stage , the finale on the @entity6 was little more than a celebration for @entity1 , or eight laps of honour , at the end of which @entity13 ’s @entity12 claimed his fourth win ahead of @entity18 ’s @entity17			1
over the three weeks @entity1 comprehensively dominated , and might have done so even if @entity19 and @entity20 had not crashed out			1
the @entity21 conquered the hills of @entity23 – winning in @entity24 – excelled over the cobbles and mud of northern @entity27 , then won in all three mountain ranges , in the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
@entity52 refused to say that @entity19 would have won had he not crashed , saying ‘ it would be disrespectful to @entity1 ’ to speculate			1
@entity57 , the @entity45 performance manager , was even more gracious			2
asked whether @entity1 would still have won had @entity19 and @entity20 not been forced out , he replied , ‘ i do n’t see why not			1
staying on your bike is part of winning a @entity34			2
’ indeed , in this tour of many crashes , it is significant that all of the riders in the top four managed to stay upright			2
the last @entity34 winner to suffer a serious crash en route to victory was @entity71 in 1985			2
that was also the last home win , though perhaps they will not have to wait 29 years for the next one			1
two @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , finished on the podium , @entity80 was sixth , and arguably the most talented of the lot , 22 - year - old @entity75 , is expected to make his @entity34 debut in 2015			2

‘ the curse of the bambino ’ , or the distraction and pressure of becoming a father , meant that @entity1 had a slow start			1
‘ the first part of the season was very difficult , ’ he acknowledged			0
‘ my daughter was born – i ’m not saying it ’s a problem , of course , it ’s a great source of happiness – but i preferred to stay with my family , my wife , and it slowed down my preparation			0

‘ in 2008 i was a bit disappointed and sad , ’ he said			0
doping was rampant , with the @entity34 from 2006 to 2008 tours producing countless positive tests			0
