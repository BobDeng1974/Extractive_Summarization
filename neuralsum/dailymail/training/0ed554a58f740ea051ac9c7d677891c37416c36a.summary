@entity1 manager @entity0 apologised to his players for losing his cool but insisted his first - half dismissal did not overshadow another memorable night after his side knocked @entity6 out of the @entity7 with a 4 - 0 third - round replay win			1
@entity0 and assistant @entity9 were both sent to the stands for their part in a mass melee in a frenetic first period that saw @entity6 defender @entity15 dismissed and the home side score three times as @entity18 produced another cup upset at @entity20			1
@entity0 and @entity9 , whose side defied the odds two years ago to reach the @entity24 final , were ordered from the dug - out by referee @entity26 for remonstrating with @entity6 defender @entity27 , whose challenge had sent @entity1 striker @entity29 crashing into the advertising hoardings			1
@entity29 heads @entity31 side @entity1 ahead after just eight minutes at @entity20 @entity29 celebrates his early strike as @entity18 started the brighter during their @entity7 replay with @entity6 but after @entity35 had added to goals from @entity29 , @entity37 and @entity38 to book a coveted fourth - round tie at @entity40 , @entity0 could not hide his delight			1
he said : ' there was a big prize at stake , to get the club into the fourth round for the first time in 15 years , so the tie at @entity50 , we wanted to achieve that and we focused on the factors that would help us			1
' i thought the lad that pushed @entity29 into the hoardings - i thought it was a dangerous challenge because there 's a wall just behind them			2
' me and @entity9 reacted and ran down , as well as some of their staff , and the ref 's decided to send me and @entity9 to the stands			1
' i said to the lads at half - time i had to apologise for that because i had to ask them to keep their cool and stay on the pitch			2
' but i 'm glad it did n't ruin a great night			0
the lads did n't need us on the touchline anyway			0
it was nice and quiet for us in the stands			2
' @entity15 ( far right ) is sent off after just six minutes for hauling down @entity29 @entity1 striker @entity37 takes his chance to fire the home side 2 - 0 up after just 17 minutes @entity18 will take on @entity40 on saturday , january 24 and @entity0 is aware of the prestige surrounding a trip to the @entity79 leaders and the subsequent cash windfall			1
' i 'm not sure ( of ) the amount but it will be worth a considerable amount of money when you look at it as a percentage of our overall budget , ' the former @entity82 and @entity83 boss added			0
' so we 're pleased with that and we set out with a focus to get there			0
it makes things easier all round for the club like it did with the trip to @entity103 two years ago			2
' @entity6 defender @entity15 was shown a straight red card for hauling down @entity29 in the sixth minute and the @entity105 never recovered			1
it was a forgettable night in a wretched season for @entity109 's side , @entity7 semi-finalists themselves two years ago			1
they are third bottom in the @entity112 table , have now won only two of their last 22 matches and boss @entity109 kept his players in the dressing room after what was a fifth defeat from their last six matches			0
@entity6 keeper @entity121 appears to punch @entity1 striker @entity37 during the feisty @entity7 clash @entity121 is the centre of the mass touchline brawl between the @entity1 and @entity6 players at @entity20 coaching staff intervened as both sets of players became embroiled in a nasty brawl in the first - half @entity109 accepted referee @entity26 was left with no choice other than to send @entity133 off and said he had never before seen a side of his fold like @entity6 did			1
he did insist he would turn things round at the club			2
' the lack of confidence in the team and in each other , we let a goal in almost straight away , ' @entity109 said			0
' you could see how bad it is for everybody and in all my time in football i 've never seen a team capitulate as bad as that			0
' all i can do is apologise to the fans			0
we 've got so much work to do			0
the lads do n't look like a @entity6 team , they did n't have any fight in them , they do n't look like my team			1
' well done to @entity18			0
to a man they looked like they wanted it more than my lot after the sending off			0
' both @entity18 and @entity6 fans were chanting ' you 're getting sacked in the morning ' and @entity109 admitted those words hurt			2
' it 's football at the moment is n't it ? i 've been doing it 19 years and 860 - odd games and this is football at the moment , ' he added			0
' i said it would be tough when i came here , but i did n't think it would be as tough as this			0
' @entity1 manager @entity0 and his assistant @entity9 were send to the stands for their part the @entity1 celebrate with second goal scorer @entity37 ( bottom right ) during the win at @entity20 @entity37 of @entity18 holds off a challenge from @entity186 and @entity187 of @entity6 @entity38 was in the right place at the right time to fire in @entity1 's third against @entity105 @entity6 the @entity6 players look dejected having conceded a fourth goal to @entity31 side @entity1 @entity6 manager @entity109 looks despondent after his side were thrashed 4 - 0 at @entity18			1
