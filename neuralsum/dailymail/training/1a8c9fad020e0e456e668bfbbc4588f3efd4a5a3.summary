by @entity0 last updated at 1:06 am on 23rd november 2011 a woman needed plastic surgery after she was mauled by three dangerous dogs owned by the wife of a wealthy wine merchant			1
@entity6 was walking her @entity8 - cross @entity7 in woods when she was set upon			2
she was knocked to the ground and bitten on the face , head and arms by the @entity15 dogs , a large muscular breed that has the strength to take down lions			1
horrific : @entity6 suffered terrible bites to her head and arms as her nine - year - old dog was savaged to death next to her			2
she is pictured in hospital after the attack which took place in woods in @entity28 painful : mrs @entity6 needed plastic surgery to her face after the attack @entity7 was savaged to death during the attack in @entity34 , @entity35			2
the three dogs , from a breed which can weigh more than 10st , had escaped from the country home of @entity40 and @entity41 , who were on holiday at the time of the attack			1
but despite being abroad , mrs @entity45 – as owner of the dogs – was ordered to pay £ 10,000 in costs because the person she had left in charge had failed to supervise them			1
recalling the attack , mrs @entity6 told @entity53 : ‘ it was horrifying			2
initially one of the dogs attacked me , then as it latched on to my arm the other two dogs started to attack my dog			1
‘ i ran towards them screaming , trying to hit one of the bigger dogs with my lead			1
but then one of them , which was so big it came up to my waist , just knocked me over and started biting my face			2
’ she continued : ‘ i buried my head in the earth to try and protect my eyes , while it was biting the back of my head			0
it then went back to attacking my dog and i realised there was nothing i could do to save her			0
they were jumping on her and biting her throat			0
‘ i was in fear for my life			0
@entity83 knows what would have happened if a child had been with me			0
’ lucky escape : after the court case , mrs @entity6 said : ' i 'm a fairly fit woman and was with a fairly large dog			0
if i had a child with me or if i had been frail then the consequences could have been much more serious ' killed : @entity92 with her dog , a @entity95 shepherd - cross , called @entity7 , which was mauled to death she added : ‘ to see your dog being mauled by other dogs and being incapable to help is every dog owner ’s worst nightmare			1
’ the trial heard that @entity41 and her husband were in @entity104 at the time of the attack and the dogs in the care of a tenant who was renting an annexe attached to their house			1
somehow mrs @entity6 , 47 , who lives near @entity28 , managed to get to a nearby house , from where she telephoned her husband and was taken to hospital			0
speaking of the breed owned by the @entity121 , mrs @entity6 , who now has a retriever - cross called biscuit , said : ‘ they are used to guard flocks of sheep in @entity125 and could bring down a leopard			0
they are incredibly unsuitable dogs to be kept as family pets and people need to be aware of the harm these breeds can present			1
’ prosecutor @entity132 said @entity41 had not fulfilled her responsibility to leave the animals in the care of someone who could adequately supervise them			0
the court was also told that 18 months earlier one of the dogs had escaped into the woods and bitten a man through his clothing			1
@entity45 , pictured here with two of her dogs			1
three of her dogs had escaped from her home while she was on holiday vicious : mrs @entity6 was attacked by three @entity15 dogs , similar to this one , which had been left to roam wild in the woods mrs @entity45 was told to pay £ 10,000 in costs and ordered to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work after being found guilty of being the owner of a dog causing injury while ‘ dangerously ’ out of control			1
one of the three dogs has since died and another has been rehomed			2
sentencing , judge @entity160 did not order that the remaining dog should be destroyed because it could not be proved to have caused the injuries to mrs @entity6 in october 2009			2
but he added : ‘ it seems to me these dogs are not appropriate to be kept in @entity165			1
’ the court heard a civil claim between mrs @entity6 and @entity41 had been settled for an undisclosed sum before the trial			0
@entity170 , defending @entity41 , said : ‘ she wishes to say how sorry she is that this incident occurred			0
’ @entity53 - based @entity41 ’s wine merchants have been selling wine since 1793 , and mr @entity41 , the 69 - year - old chairman of the company , is the fourth generation of his family to run the business			0
speaking after the sentencing , his wife said : ‘ there is nothing i can say which will make her dog come back			0
‘ what i would obviously like to say is that we are terribly sorry			0
it really has been a most unfortunate incident with bad consequences			0
