a study found the gentle giants can distinguish a warlike tribe from a more peaceable people , simply by listening to recordings of their voices			1
not only could the @entity13 elephants tell the two languages apart , they could also work out if the speaker was a man or a woman and an adult or a child			1
elephants never forget ... a voice : the gentle giants can distinguish a warlike tribe from a more peaceable people , simply by listening to recordings of their voices			1
not only could the african elephants ( stock image ) tell the two languages apart , they could also work out if the speaker was a man or a woman and an adult or a child this is despite the recordings being just a few seconds long			1
the researchers , including conservationist @entity34 , believe the creatures use voice and language to help them work out which humans pose a threat to them			1
they can then choose whether to defend themselves against attack or continue going about life as usual			2
the researchers began my making recordings of members of two @entity47 tribes repeating the phrase ‘ look , look over there , a group of elephants is coming ’			1
one tribe was the @entity53 , who historically killed elephants as a rite of passage on entering adulthood			1
they also take revenge when elephants kill their cattle			0
the researchers began my making recordings of members of two @entity47 tribes repeating the phrase ' look , look over there , a group of elephants is coming '			1
one tribe was the @entity53 , ( pictured ) who historically killed elephants as a rite of passage on entering adulthood the second was the @entity70 , who farm crops and have a more amicable relationship with the elephants			1
the tapes were then played through loudspeakers to groups of elephants in the @entity79 in @entity47 and their reactions noted			1
the animals were clearly more scared of the @entity53 and bunched together defensively on hearing them speak			2
they also used their trunks to sniff at the air on hearing a @entity53 voice , likely in an attempt to pick up smells that would provide more information about the intruder			1
as the same phrase was used in all the recordings and it was spoken in the same way each time , it is believed the animals were able to tell the two languages apart			0
their skill did n’t end there			0
the elephants were also more likely to act defensively on hearing a male @entity53 than female			2
they were also more likely to retreat on hearing a grown man than a boy			0
elephants grieve like humans and are believed to suffer from post traumatic stress grieving : elephants grieve like humans , shedding tears and taking part in rituals to ' bury ' bodies			2
and the damaging effects of grief from death - especially of a parent - stay with them for decades , according to recent research at the @entity120			0
the study has found that @entity13 elephants who were orphaned by a cull in @entity125 in the 1970s and 1980s are still suffering post-traumatic stress			0
singing : the large creatures use an ultrasound rumble - often too low for humans to hear - to keep a herd together and for males to find mates			0
by doing this , they can communicate six miles away sneaking : elephants carry out raids on crops when the nights are the darkest and scientists have found that their foraging expeditions in @entity13 tend to vary with the lunar cycle			0
fewer raids take place during a full moon when farmers are more likely to spot the animals plundering their crops			0
it is thought that elephants deliberately alter their behaviour to reduce the risks of encountering humans			2
remembering : older elephants remember dangerous situations and are able to best make crucial decisions about predators , based on their previous perilous experiences			0
when scientists played families lion roars from a loudspeaker , those with older matriarchs correctly focused their defensive reactions on male lions that are the most adept killers			0
pointing : a study published last year found that jungle elephants instinctively known what pointing means - and are the only animal capable of this feat. professor @entity172 from @entity173 said : ‘ what elephants share with humans is that they live in an elaborate and complex network in which support , empathy , and help for others are critical for survival			2

elephants can distinguish a warlike tribe from a more peaceable people by listening to their voices
african elephants in the @entity79 in @entity47 can tell the *difference* between two languages used by the @entity53 and @entity70 tribes
they use voice and language to help them work out which humans pose a threat to them so they can choose whether to attack or not
