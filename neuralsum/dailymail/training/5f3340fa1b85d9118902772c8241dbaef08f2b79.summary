one of @entity1 ’s biggest hotel chains has removed bibles from its rooms to avoid upsetting non-christians			2
the decision by @entity7 has been condemned as ‘ tragic and bizarre ’ by the @entity8 , which says @entity2 in hotel rooms are important to provide hope , comfort and inspiration to travellers			1
but the chain , which runs 500 hotels , said the country was becoming increasingly multicultural and it had taken the action for ‘ diversity reasons ’			1
bibles were taken away at the same time as a refurbishment of its rooms , removing drawers where they were kept			0
the bibles , which were provided free by the @entity38 , have been retained and are stored behind reception for guests to borrow on request , the company says			1
a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ it seems both tragic and bizarre that hotels would remove the word of @entity44 for the sake of ergonomic design , economic incentive or a spurious definition of the word “ diversity ”			1
’ it seems not all @entity52 even have bibles available on request			0
at the branch in @entity57 , south @entity58 , there was no @entity59 in the room or behind reception			0
hidden : the bibles , donated by the @entity38 , have been retained and are stored behind reception for guests to borrow on request , the company says when requested , the receptionist could not find a copy and said no one had ever asked him for one in his four months of working @entity70 , he suggested using the hotel ’s free wifi to ‘ @entity73 it and read it online ’			1
when pushed for a hard copy , he rang his manager who told him they used to have them in rooms , but had n’t had any at the hotel since refurbishment last year			0
but other hotel firms , including @entity1 ’s largest budget hotel company , @entity86 , and @entity87 , owners of the @entity90 chain , say bibles are being retained at their hotels			1
a @entity86 spokesman said : ‘ bibles are available in @entity86 rooms			0
‘ on the rare occasion that a customer does not wish to have a @entity59 in their room , they can request this to be removed ahead of their stay by contacting the hotel directly			0
’ upmarket hotel chain @entity105 , which runs four - star hotels in areas including @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , confirmed it still has @entity2 in rooms and has no plans to remove them despite ‘ welcoming guests from around the world ’			1
@entity7 is the first national hotel chain to remove @entity2 – although in 2012 one independent hotel , the @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity119 , replaced them with the erotic bestseller @entity122			2
a @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ the reason is because of diversity			0
with the country being increasingly multicultural , we did n’t feel it was appropriate to just have the @entity59 because there are people of other religions			1
people were also taking bibles away and with the redesign of the rooms , it was felt that it would be better to remove them			0
’ another spokesman added : ‘ in order not to discriminate against any religion , customers who would like a @entity59 can pick a copy from any one of @entity7 ’s 500 hotel reception desks across the country , whilst staying at the hotel			1
to date , @entity7 has not received any customer feedback regarding this decision			0
’ they went on to say : ‘ the removal of @entity2 from hotel rooms was a policy we decided upon in 2007 and has been gradually implemented over the following years			2
’ the practice of placing bibles in @entity1 hotel rooms originated with the @entity154 late in the @entity153 era			0
the organisation was founded in 1888 , with backing from the owners of biscuit manufacturer @entity157 , and donated bibles to hotels around the country			1
in more recent years , the work was taken over by the @entity38 , which distributes free bibles in almost 194 countries worldwide			2
members of the @entity38 , an evangelical @entity166 organisation founded in the @entity167 in 1898 , were inspired to give out free bibles in hotel rooms after visiting @entity1 and seeing the @entity154 ’s work			2
in the @entity1 , the @entity38 , whose income comes from donations and bequests from wills , still continues this mission – giving out free bibles to large institutions , including hospitals and prisons			2
copies of the @entity181 are also presented to school pupils , members of the armed forces , police , ambulance and fire services .			0

the chain , which runs 500 hotels , has made the move for ' diversity reasons '
@entity194 country is becoming increasingly multicultural and @entity2 ' discriminate '
@entity8 condemned action , branding it ' tragic and bizarre '
bibles are ' important to provide inspiration to travellers ' , they said
the books donated by @entity38 are now hidden behind reception
