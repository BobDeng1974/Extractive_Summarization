by @entity0 published : 07:19 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 07:20 est , 28 january 2013 new stress : middle age used to be a time to enjoy leisurely pursuits , but a study has found that an increase find themselves caring for two generations of family members instead middle age used to be a time to throw off the shackles of parenthood and hit the golf course or go on that dream holiday you could never afford because of the commitment of having children			1
but that longed - for time to yourself has been replaced by a new set of worries according to a new study			2
gone is the ' empty nest ' of past generations , the homes of the middle - aged are still full to the rafters with grown - up children who ca n't afford to move out and ca n't get a job			1
but it 's not just the children of the so - called ' boomerang generation ' that are proving a burden to the middle aged			1
an increasing number are also taking in their elderly parents to provide care for them			0
a study , carried out by researchers at the @entity42 in the @entity43 , blames the recession for making it harder for young people to start their career and family and flee the nest			1
and it says that living longer adds unanticipated needs to care for elderly parents			2
while putting ' empty nest ' plans on hold is not a problem for most when it comes to helping their offspring , it can be a little more frustrating when according to the study			0
@entity62 , director of the @entity63 said : ' we mostly found very positive feelings about adults helping their children in the emerging adulthood stage of life , from around ages 18 to 30			2
' feelings about helping parents were n’t so much negative as just filled with more angst and uncertainty			0
' as a society we still do n’t socialize people to expect to be taking on a parent - caring role , even though most of us will at some point in our lives			2
' the average middle - aged couple has more parents than children			1
' the study focused on six sample groups in 2009 - 10 and the results have recently been published in the @entity86			2
care : the @entity42 study found that middle - aged people had mixed feelings about having to care for elderly parents it concluded that most middle - aged parents with young adult children are fairly happy to help them out , and they understand that getting started in life is simply more difficult now			1
some research has suggested that age 25 is the new 22 ; that substantially more parents now do n’t even expect their kids to be financially independent in their early 20s , and do n’t mind helping them through some difficult times			0
but the response to helping adult parents who , at the same time , need increasing amounts of assistance is not as uniformly positive , the study found – it can be seen as both a joy and a burden , and in any case was not something most middle - aged adults anticipated			1
many middle - aged people said it was difficult to make any plans , due to anxiety and uncertainty about a parent ’s health at any point in time			1
they are being forced to re-evaluate their own lives say the researchers			0
@entity120 said they we ’re willing to help their aging parents , but a sense of being time - starved was a frequent theme			0
tough : many middle - aged people surveyed said that they found it difficult to make plans and were re-evaluating their lives because of caring for elderly parents and supporting grown - up children one participant in the study said : ' it brings my heart joy to be able to provide for my mom this way			1
' there are times when it ’s a burden and i feel resentful			0
' the university research appears to be backed up by @entity143 statistics			0
@entity145 figures released in 2012 said that nearly a quarter of 20 to 34 - year - olds were still living with their parents in 2011			2
that total had shot up around 20 per cent since 1997			0
nearly two million men and more than a million women were still living at home			0
but previous studies have suggested that instead of fearing the ' empty nest ' many parents are now dreading having to work until the age of 80 to afford to look after elderly parents as well as children who ca n't , or wo n't , leave the family home			1
a report from insurance firm @entity161 said that some 900,000 people in the @entity143 expect to work well into the 70s or 80s before they can afford to retire .			0

a study by @entity42 found that middle - aged parents are facing new stress
recession hit children are living in the parental home longer
but people are also having to move ageing parents into the family home
