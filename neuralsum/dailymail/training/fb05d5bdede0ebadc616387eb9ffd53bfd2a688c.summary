her penchant for elaborate hats and red lipstick is legendary but it seems the @entity4 is about to shake up her elegant signature style			2
her majesty is famous for her boxy @entity8 handbags and the latest version , the @entity10 , has been carefully calibrated to work with the royal wardrobe			1
while the £ 1,130 arm candy retains the ladylike shape beloved of the queen , the new version is smaller and lighter than her usual luggage and comes in a rainbow of cheerful colours			2
fit for a queen : the new @entity20 bag was included in the selection sent to @entity22 for summer although the @entity4 usually carries the traviata style , @entity8 say the @entity10 bag was included in the selection sent to @entity22 for @entity26 - and met with a favourable reception from officials			1
' throughout 2014 , her majesty has opted for bolder colour choices and our more fashion forward designs , ' commented @entity33 ceo , @entity32			0
' for her majesty to wear one of our @entity10 ’s would really encapsulate her time as a @entity37 fashion icon			2
he added : ' the @entity10 was actually named after @entity39 who lent her name after becoming the latest in a long line of @entity37 actresses to fall in love with our designs , so it be a really special patriotic statement if her majesty wore this design			1
' the new bag is the smallest @entity49 have ever produced and comes in a range of bright hues , including fuschia and tangerine			0
trademark : @entity4 , pictured left with @entity55 's first lady @entity54 , is rarely without a @entity8 bag @entity57 : the new @entity20 bag comes in a choice of tangerine , grey , fuchsia or teal , as well as bespoke hues although the @entity4 usually plumps for the black patent option , @entity8 say that some of the more colourful versions were included in the selection sent to @entity69			1

available in dove grey , fuchsia and teal , the bag is smaller and brighter than the rest of the @entity8 collection and is crafted from the brand 's trademark patent calf leather and finished with @entity8 ’s new gold - plated glossy rope logo fitting			1
