when dr @entity1 ’s critics hear that he is going to do stand - up comedy at the @entity3 this year they ’ll be hoping his act dies on stage , but the voluntary euthanasia advocate is hoping for a much funnier ending			1
the 67 - year - old is teaming up with @entity10 comedian @entity9 , who has been diagnosed with a brain tumour , in an effort to provide some entertainment by laughing at death			1
dr @entity1 ’s in need of a laugh as his medical registration was suspended by the @entity19 in july 2014			1
an initial appeal to overturn his suspension from practising medicine was rejected earlier this month			0
dr @entity1 will make his debut in stand - up comedy at the @entity3 this year in his autobiography dr @entity1 ’s @entity26 if i do he finishes it by saying that if his legal wrangles get too much he could always try stand - up comedy as ‘ there are worse things than dying laughing ’			1
after reading the autobiography ms @entity32 , who is just 35 years old and was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2011 , got in touch as the final line resonated wither her			1
‘ her illness forced her to think about her mortality which is why she read my book and contacted me , ’ dr @entity1 , who lives in @entity37 , explained			1
@entity10 comedian @entity9 with be the other half of the double act			1
ms @entity32 was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2011 ‘ we talked a lot about death and the choices she has before we ever talked about comedy			1
we talked about her having a peaceful end to her life , but it was really a matter of giving her that reassurance that was she was back in control			0
‘ she was very grateful for the exchange we had			0
but she was also looking at getting back into stand - up after taking a year or so off , because of her serious illness			2
‘ it was then she brought up the last line of my autobiography and said how it would make a good premise for a show , and if i ’d be interested in taking part in it			0
’ the upshot of it all is they ’re set to perform for a month at the @entity3 in august where they ’ll do a one - hour show six nights a week			0
no laughing matter : dr @entity1 ’s had his medical registration suspended by the @entity19 in july 2014 dr @entity1 has a lot of experiences to draw upon			2
in 1996 , he became the first doctor in the world to administer a legal , lethal voluntary injection under the short - lived @entity83 ( @entity84 )			2
four of his terminally ill patients used this law to end their suffering before the law was overturned in march 1997 by the @entity89 @entity88			0
the same year , dr @entity1 found the @entity90 ( now called @entity91 )			2
despite not practising as a doctor for well over a decade however , his medical registration was suspended by the @entity19 in july last year after he admitted to supporting 45 - year - old @entity96 man @entity95 's decision to take his own life despite knowing he was not terminally ill. dr @entity1 and @entity98 believe that there can still be laughs when it comes to death but he has now a chance to put his latest travails behind him , and although dr @entity1 ’s work may seem like one that would n’t raise many smiles , he believes this is n’t the case at all			1
‘ i have given a lot of workshops to many people in their 70s and 80s and they turn out to be excruciatingly funny affairs			0
elderly people have a much more sanguine approach to their own mortality and to death in particular , ’ he said			0
‘ over the years many people have got a great amount of entertainment out of this subject			0
for some time i ’d wondered if it would translate to a younger audience			0
@entity9 ’s been forced now to engage with this issue because of her illness and her observations on it all are very funny			2
‘ the idea then is to put it all together in a format that ’s entertaining and for it to be informative to the younger audiences that will see it			0
’ the @entity3 in @entity136 has unearthed many new comedy talents over the years both dr @entity1 and ms @entity32 are currently working on the scripts , and they ’ll be doing some face to face work soon			1
‘ they tell me you sink or swim – or in our case , live or die – in the first few days at @entity136 as the reviewers can be ruthless , so we ’ll have to make sure we can make it as good as we can get it before then , ’ he said			1
if it all works the @entity3 will be only the start for the duo and they hope to bring the routine to @entity89 and beyond if it proves to be successful			0
‘ it really was a stroke of great luck that @entity9 materialised and took an interest in what we ’re doing at exit in the first place			2
it ’s a pretty universal theme so we ’ll just see how it goes , ’ he said			0
dr @entity1 hopes that a successful run in @entity136 could see the routine coming to @entity89			1

*controversial* suspended doctor @entity1 to try his hand at stand - up
he will be one half of a double act with @entity10 comedian @entity9
ms @entity32 returns to stage after being diagnosed with brain tumour in 2011
comedian contacted the doctor after reading his @entity173 if i do
' they tell me you sink or swim – or in our case , live or die – in the first few days at @entity136 , ' says dr @entity1
