on this weekend 12 months ago , @entity0 were the subject of this column			1
they had endured a shaky start to the campaign and , though they had just beaten @entity8 in the @entity9 , i asked whether @entity0 supporters , if they were given the option , would take @entity13 back over @entity14			1
@entity14 , of course , went on to enjoy a dream first season in @entity19 football , leading @entity0 to the @entity21 title , as well as the @entity9			1
he also took the club into the @entity24 knockout stages for the first time			0
this time last year @entity0 were celebrating beating @entity8 in the @entity9 fourth round twelve months on , @entity14 's side crashed out to the @entity29 in the same competition but here we are again on the first weekend of november , after another @entity9 tie against @entity8 , and another question needs asking : what is different about @entity14 ’s @entity0 and the one of his predecessor ? the players who helped @entity13 capture the title in 2012 are the ones who @entity14 relied on and they even became champions in similarly dramatic circumstances , capitalising when the team that seemed destined for first place capsized on the run - in			1
some would argue @entity14 ’s team are more expansive but how important was that ? @entity0 ’s goal difference in 2012 was +64 , when they finished with 89 points			1
last year it was +65 but their tally had dropped to 86 points			0
when you consider that , ‘ not much ’ would be your answer			0
this is not an attack on @entity0 ’s quality , by any means			1
when everything clicks , they are a fantastic side with some wonderful players and the patchy start they have endured to this campaign should not detract from what @entity14 has achieved over the past 12 months			2
@entity0 , though , look like a team which must be changed and refreshed if it is going to carry on moving forward			1
whether they successfully defend the title or fail to contain @entity68 , @entity14 ’s squad needs to be broken up			0
has much changed at @entity0 since @entity14 ( left ) took over from @entity13 ( right ) ? with an average age of 28.5 , @entity0 ’s first - choice team — @entity71 ; @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 ; @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 ; @entity80 , @entity81 — is the oldest in the @entity21			1
it is also older than the first - choices of @entity85 ( 26.2 ) and @entity86 ( 27 )			1
those two clubs are the ones @entity0 want to eventually rival but the thing that should provide most concern for @entity14 is the fact that for all the money that has been invested , there is no exciting youngster ready to explode on to the scene like @entity96 or @entity97			1
a lot has been made about the huge investment that has gone into revamping the club ’s academy but it is going to take time for the results of the work that goes on there to be seen , and the immediate concern is how much it will cost to keep them towards the head of the pack			0
it was clear they had a policy in the summer and were certain about who they wanted to bring in — @entity116 , for instance , came into a position they needed to fill			0
they also made sure they tied down a number of their key performers to long contracts			0
but it is looking like a mistake not to bring in a replacement after @entity128 was allowed to join @entity129 , as with the system that @entity14 plays , he needs four strikers at his disposal			2
@entity74 ( centre ) and @entity72 ( right ) are in an ageing squad at 33 and 29 respectively @entity77 ( centre ) is also on the wrong side of 30 and has had a disappointing season so far @entity0 do not have a promising first - team youngster like @entity97 ( left ) or @entity96 city need to make big changes to their squad , even if they retain their @entity21 title he likes using two up front and he could have done with another body to ease the pressure on @entity81 , @entity80 and @entity147			1
could they have done more to take @entity149 on loan ? expectation now follows @entity0 , so when they have a run of three games without a win , as is the case now , they are scrutinised and sections of their supporters , who have got used to success , have been unnerved by the start to the campaign @entity14 has overseen			1
for @entity14 , a man who does not make bold statements , to say after the 2 - 0 defeat by @entity8 in midweek that ‘ we are not the team we used to be ’ shows how difficult things have been			1
why did he name such a strong side in that match ? was it a sign that he feels the league title and @entity24 are out of reach ? the defeat was bad enough , the injuries to @entity79 and @entity77 were even worse			0
now they are facing two matches they simply can not lose			0
@entity79 will be a major loss for @entity0 as they host @entity178 at the @entity179 on sunday first comes the @entity181 derby — a fixture that has been good for @entity0 in recent years , as five wins in the past six league meetings with @entity178 shows — then a fight for survival in the @entity24 against @entity187			1
@entity188 is where @entity0 want to be making an impact			2
chief executive @entity191 and director of football @entity192 , who arrived from @entity194 to run the club , wo n’t accept failure readily and @entity14 will face serious questions if he fails to get his team out of the group			2
@entity191 and @entity192 stood by @entity200 when they were at @entity194 but that was because he was unbelievably successful and they wo n’t shy away from making changes if they feel that is what is required to keep building			0
we should not forget that after a @entity208 , it is notoriously difficult for teams to find their rhythm early on			0
only @entity68 have come flying out of the blocks , building up a six - point advantage over @entity0 during a period in which they have faced matches at @entity215 and the @entity179			2
should the gap reach nine points this weekend , @entity0 will not pull that back			2
whether they win or not , the squad needs some big changes in the summer			0
@entity68 have established themselves as the team to beat in the @entity21 this season strikers grapple too ! it has been interesting to read all the views on shirt - pulling this week after @entity225 began its campaign for a clampdown			1
i ’m relieved , though , that the campaign has started now , rather than when i was playing , as i dare say i would have featured in some of the images that have been used on these pages ! it is difficult to mark at a corner when you are trying to keep your eye on both the ball and your man , so you invariably want to feel where your opponent is — and stop him getting away from you — while you follow the flight of the ball			2
from a defender ’s point of view , i will say this : if you can stop your opponent and not get penalised by the referee , you are going to do it to gain an advantage			0
the issue , however , has become rife , so it is right that we try to stop it			0
but if the campaign is successful , i think you will find defenders wanting a new one to be launched to stop them being blocked by forwards ! @entity255 highlighted the problem of grappling in the box during @entity259 's defeat to @entity260 this week i 'm looking forward to ... watching @entity8 's young stars progress given the passion for football in the area , it has been a mystery to me that @entity8 ’s teams have gone without home - grown talent for so long			1
we might have had a glimpse of the future , though , at the @entity179 on wednesday night when a youthful and inexperienced team knocked the holders out of the @entity9			2
it would be naive to think those who helped defeat @entity0 — such as 17 - year - old @entity276 and 18 - year - old @entity277 — will all become fixtures in the team in the coming weeks on the back of one excellent result			1
but they have given themselves a great chance of having a long - term future at the club and i ’m sure @entity285 will look to reward them with more opportunities going forward			0
@entity8 ’s fans are desperate for a local hero to emerge			2
it is about time that they had one			0
@entity277 announced his arrival with the opening goal for @entity8 against @entity0 in midweek i visited @entity293 last week to take part in a question - and - answer session for aspiring coaches who were working towards getting their ‘ b ’ licence			1
i had a good look around before my talk and i was deeply impressed by the set - up			0
it is no exaggeration to say it is a world - class facility			0
our task now is to produce the players and coaches to match it .			0

@entity0 are a team which must be changed and refreshed
the average age of 28.5 is older than @entity85 and @entity86 's @entity311
defenders might want a new ' hands off ' campaign ... for strikers !
i 'm looking forward to seeing @entity8 's youngsters in action again
