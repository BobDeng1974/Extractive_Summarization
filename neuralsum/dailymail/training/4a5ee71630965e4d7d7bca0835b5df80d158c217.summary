you might think of @entity1 as lumbering cavemen who feasted on slaughtered beasts , but new research suggests they preferred far more refined cuisine			2
a study of ancient fossilised poo left behind by our distant cousins reveals they had a diet which featured vegetables and nuts			0
the 50,000 - year - old samples from @entity16 are the oldest known @entity1 faecal matter and suggest cavemen knew the importance of a varied diet			1
a study of ancient fossilised poo left behind by @entity1 reveals they had a varied diet which featured vegetables and nuts , as well as meat researchers from @entity27 and @entity28 in @entity16 used analytical techniques to find faecal biomarkers from five samples found in @entity32 , southern @entity16			1
the scientists analysed each sample for metabolised versions of animal - derived cholesterol , as well as phytosterol , a cholesterol - like compound found in plants			1
while all samples contained signs of meat consumption , two samples showed traces of plants - the first direct evidence that @entity1 may have enjoyed omnivorous meals			1
‘ we have passed through different phases in our interpretation of @entity1 , ’ says @entity47 , a graduate student at the @entity28 who led the analysis			1
while all poo samples contained signs of meat consumption , two samples showed traces of plants - the first direct evidence that @entity1 may have enjoyed an omnivorous diet researchers from @entity27 and @entity28 in @entity16 used analytical techniques to find faecal biomarkers from five samples found in @entity32 , southern @entity16 ‘ it 's important to understand all aspects of why humanity has come to dominate the planet the way it does , ’ adds co-author @entity57 , a professor of geobiology			1
‘ a lot of that has to do with improved nutrition over time			0
’ researchers recently identified plant microfossils trapped in @entity1 teeth ( pictured ) while scientists have attempted to reconstruct the @entity1 diet before , much of the evidence has been inconclusive			2
for example , researchers have analysed bone fragments for carbon and nitrogen isotopes - signs that @entity1 may have consumed certain prey , such as pigs versus cows			1
but these studies could only differentiate between protein sources - underestimating plant intake , and depicting the @entity1 as exclusively carnivorous			0
other researchers recently found plant microfossils trapped in @entity1 teeth - a finding that suggests the species may have led a more complex lifestyle , harvesting and cooking a variety of plants in addition to hunting prey			2
however , ms @entity94 says it is also possible that @entity1 did n't eat plants directly , but consumed them through the stomach contents of their prey , leaving traces of plants in their teeth			2
equally likely , she says , is another scenario : ‘ sometimes in prehistoric societies , they used their teeth as tools , biting plants , among other things			0
‘ we ca n't assume they were actually eating the plants based on finding microfossils in their teeth			0
’ the researchers believe that while @entity1 had a mostly meat - based diet , they may have also consumed a fairly regular portion of plants , such as tubers , berries , and nuts			1
‘ we believe @entity1 probably ate what was available in different situations , seasons , and climates , ’ ms @entity94 added			1
skulls reveal how cavemen used teeth as a third hand the biggest collection of ancient human fossils ever recovered from one site is causing scientists to reconsider the path of human evolution			0
they reveal how @entity1 , our sister species , developed their distinctive teeth before their brains , using them as a third hand for holding objects			0
last week , a new study added to theories that the @entity1 evolved their characteristic looks slowly , and intermittently , over hundreds of thousands of years			0
the ancient skulls , dating back 400,000 years , show @entity1 - like features in the face and teeth , while other parts of the skulls , including the brain case , resembled those of more primitive human ancestors			2
this suggests the earliest @entity1 used their jaws in a particular way for chewing as well as for holding objects			0
the discovery at the @entity152 site in @entity16 's @entity152 has allowed scientists to better understand pre-human evolution during the @entity155 period - a time in which the path of hominin evolution has been controversial and fiercely debated			1
@entity159 , a paleontologist at the @entity160 , claims the findings were consistent with a ' @entity163 ' evolutionary saga			0
in this scenario communities of humans , equivalent to ' houses ' in the sci - fi series , would compete for habitable areas more than 400,000 years ago .			0

scientists analysed ancient poo samples at @entity32 site in southern @entity16
they studied each for metabolised versions of animal - derived cholesterol
they also looked at phytosterol , a cholesterol - like compound in plants
while all samples contained signs of meat , two showed traces of plants
' we believe @entity1 probably ate what was available in different situations , seasons , and climates , ’ said researcher @entity47
