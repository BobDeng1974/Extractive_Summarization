by @entity0 being a professional sportsman is a short - lived career			1
‘ all footballers know that the end is nigh , ’ writes @entity3 in her mesmerising memoir of the highs and lows of being a top footballer ’s wife			1
in the light of @entity16 ’s @entity15 disaster , it ’s a remarkably prescient reflection			1
she reveals that her husband ( ‘ my man ’ ) is an @entity16 international nearing the end of his career			1
here come the girls : @entity25 hit the hotspots of @entity27 during the @entity15 in @entity28 in 2006 and no doubt while ‘ hurting bad ’ , as @entity16 captain @entity30 eloquently described his @entity32 mood , the @entity3 ’s nameless husband will be drawing consolation from his wife ’s rollicking account of her career as a @entity38			1
but first , the question that we ’re all dying to ask : how do you get to be a @entity38 ? ‘ many wags seem to be in denial about how they got together with their man , ’ writes our guide to the secrets of @entity45 ( let ’s call her sw for short )			1
‘ however , denial is not just a river in @entity53			1
’ oh , stop it , do ! she ’s not just a @entity38 , but a wag as well			1
‘ the fact is that most wags met their footballing fellas when they were drunk as skunks and hanging around in the vip areas in a nightclub			1
’ hurting bad : @entity38 @entity63 in the crowd as @entity16 play @entity65 , final score 2 - 1 that , at any rate , is how our girl got lucky			1
she was 18 and newly arrived at an unnamed university			1
( studying what ? @entity73 ? alas , @entity3 is maddeningly vague on detail )			2
after working hard for her a-levels , she was ‘ single and very much ready to mingle ’			2
a favourite mingling spot was the ‘ biggest nightclub in the city where , on a saturday night , the @entity80 footballers could always be found ’			2
not that sw was on the lookout for them : ‘ i certainly was n’t a one - night stand kind of girl and was not willing to become a used piece of footballer ’s meat			2
’ ‘ however , i found myself ’ — as you do — ‘ at the club for an 18th birthday party			2
i was dressed in tartan hotpants and a lace backless top with no bra			2
i teamed my outfit with black pointy stilettos and a black leather bag covered with metal studs			2
’ though not otherwise gifted with acute powers of observation , @entity3 can always be relied on when it comes to the minutiae of a saucy get - up			2
her fashion notes on the outfits she wears to entice her husband are especially helpful			1
‘ i ’ve worn the classic nurse outfit , maid outfit and naughty - schoolgirl outfit			2
when i dress in my pvc halter - neck teddy - suit lingerie that my husband spontaneously bought me , i play the dominatrix role			1
’ i ’m sure we all wish that our own husbands would be as spontaneous			2
meanwhile , back at the nightclub , the tartan hotpants worked their magic			2
standing at the bar was a chap wearing ‘ a lightweight casual jacket over a t - shirt , dark - blue denim jeans , bright - white trainers and his hair was spiked - up			0
every item of his clothing sported a designer label and his look was streets ahead of how most of the chavvy blokes in the club chose to dress			0
’ @entity140 's soft stirrup crocodile shoulder bag - a @entity38 favourite - costs £ 19,000 having ascertained that he was n’t a chav , @entity3 engaged the handsome stranger in conversation			1
‘ i know we did n’t discuss anything intellectual since he was a footballer and			0
‘ we engaged in light pleasantries			0
then , to my surprise , he invited me to do a tequila slammer			0
’ concluding from his courtly behaviour that she ’d picked a good one , @entity3 permitted him to take her to the cinema			0
‘ i decided on dark - denim flared jeans , high black ankle boots , and a shimmery , sleeveless top			0
for quirkiness , i completed the ensemble with a black bowler hat			0
’ he was wearing double denim and ordered ‘ a man - mountain of snacks ’ , but did n’t try to kiss her			0
@entity169 was disappointed , but ‘ even with food and drink falling out of his mouth , i found him immensely attractive ’			0
footballing royalty : @entity175 and @entity176 are the power couple of the football he eventually made a move and , not long afterwards , she found herself wearing a blindfold in a stretch limo , on her way to a restaurant where they feasted on foie gras ( ‘ as an animal lover i resolved that , tasty as it was , i ’d not eat it again ’ )			1
with the steak and creme brulee out of the way , her chap lowered himself to one knee and handed her a little box			0
ever the lady : ‘ the voice in my head screamed , “ oh , s * * * ! ” ’ and who can blame her			0
it was a large square diamond set in a thin band of platinum			0
the wedding was a corker , bankrolled by a well - known glossy magazine			0
their guests would n’t be allowed to take any photographs , and ‘ we had to guarantee that we ’d have a substantial number of famous faces at our wedding ’			0
but ‘ we knew that we wanted to share our big day with as many people as possible : since the magazine ’s readership was several million people worldwide , we figured that was			0
they ’re all heart , this pair			0
and never more so than when it comes to good works			0
‘ with regard to our charity work , @entity38 should stand for “ @entity226 ”			1
’ of course , the perfect life of a @entity38 is not without its own problems			1
@entity3 struggles with her weight ( ‘ i have only very recently concluded that fad diets do not work ’ )			1
more seriously , she reveals that she has suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder , and endured difficulties in becoming pregnant that were compounded by an early miscarriage			1
happily , the safe arrival of a carefully unspecified number of children and a diet of freshly steamed vegetables restored the marital equilibrium to the point at which rumours of infidelity in a tabloid newspaper were calmly dismissed ( ‘ i picked up my dressing - table chair and hurled it at his head ’ )			0
' i will not miss the public exposure that @entity45 has brought , not one little bit ' @entity38 and now , in the painful aftermath of the @entity15 defeat , it may be all over			1
about time , too , according to sw : ‘ i will not miss the public exposure that @entity45 has brought , not one little bit			1
’ poor mr @entity169 may be broken and hurting after @entity16 ’s recent @entity15 humiliation , but he ’s got his impressive property portfolio to fall back on , along with an ambition to get into punditry , doubtless inspired by @entity261 ’s unstoppable fluency			0
meanwhile , sw ‘ vows to live in the shadows only as long as my husband is basking in the sunshine , and he ’s had enough to last him a lifetime			1
it ’ll soon be my time to shine			0
’ watch out , @entity176			0
it sounds as though nothing short of world domination will do .			0

the @entity38 says most *future* wags meet their footballing fellas when they *'re* drunk in nightclubs
reveals she has suffered from difficulties with her weight , obsessive compulsive disorder and early miscarriage
*constant* public exposure of @entity283 can be *draining*
now she wants to get out of her husband 's shadow
