staying warm in the winter is often a case of piling on more and more layers			0
but one entrepreneur has found a new way to keep the cold weather at bay - by creating clothes with built in ' central heating '			2
the @entity10 shirt has six pockets which hold thermo - chemical packs over the body 's major blood vessels , turning the wearer 's circulatory system into a heating network			1
called @entity10 ( shown ) it has six pouches that store thermo - chemical packs			1
the pockets are positioned in a way that a person 's whole body is heated			1
regular hand warmers can also be used in each of the pockets it was invented by @entity20 - based @entity33 who wanted to solve the problem of getting cold during paintball games without prohibiting his movement with bulky layers			1
the entrepreneur developed the thermal base layer - which has reusable heaters on the shoulders , stomach and hips - which sells for £ 47 in the @entity45 ( $ 74.95 in the @entity46 )			1
the product , which is currently seeking funding on @entity49 , has six different pockets in which heat packets can be stored			1
researchers at the @entity53 in @entity54 have created a fabric circuit board ( @entity56 ) that could be incorporated into clothing for a number of purposes			0
one of these is the ability to create ‘ smart bulletproof vests ’ that could tell people away from the front lines that the person wearing it has been shot			2
and the team who made the fabric circuit board says it can be stretched a million times and washed 30 times with no detrimental effects			0
the team put some of the @entity56 inside energy - absorbing fabrics such as @entity75 to create the smart vests			0
a bullet was then fired into the vest , and they found that the fabric circuits could register when they had been shot			0
this means that , on the battlefield for example , they could send a signal to a medic when a solider has been shot			0
according to the inventor , these evenly spread heat over a person 's body , ensuring they stay warm in cold conditions			1
' @entity10 takes the place of multiple layers of clothing and keeps the user warmer while not restricting mobility , ' the company writes on @entity49			2
' pockets are designed to hold thermo - chemical packs and are arranged along major blood vessels			1
' this allows the wearer 's circulatory system to use the blood as a heat transfer fluid			0
' using the blood to modify body temperature permits the wearer to maintain their appendage and core body temperature and enhance their tolerance of otherwise uncomfortable or dangerous temperatures			0
' the top is available in green , blue , red or black , while the thermal insets can also be replaced by hand warmers bought from garages and supermarkets			2
however , the company adds that for every 30 minutes the heat packets are used , they should be taken out for five minutes to prevent the clothing overheating			0
they also add that those with sensitive skin should keep the heat packets in for less time			0
the top is available in green , blue , red or black , while the thermal insets can also be replaced by hand warmers bought from garages and supermarkets			2
the pockets are designed to dissipate heat evenly around a person 's body ( illustration shown ) and keep them warm in all circumstances the £ 47 ( $ 74.95 ) product is currently part of a @entity49 campaign			1
' @entity10 takes the place of multiple layers of clothing and keeps the user warmer while not restricting mobility , ' the company writes on @entity49			2
' pockets are designed to hold thermo - chemical packs and are arranged along major blood vessels ' wearing the shirt against your skin with no layer underneath keeps the heat packs as close as possible to your body ( illustrated )			1
this allows them to transfer heat to your arteries and veins , which can then be circulated around your body in cold weather			0
