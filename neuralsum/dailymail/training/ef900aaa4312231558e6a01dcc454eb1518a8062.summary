by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 04:13 est , 19 july 2013 @entity1 was a ' normal ' , 40 - year - old housewife and mother - of - three when she discovered her psychic powers			1
the softly - spoken @entity4 was informed she had the gift by a medium , while being given a reading of her own , and immediately began testing it out			0
now aged 49 and living in @entity9 , @entity1 has spent the last nine years building a trusted client base of people who visit her for spiritual meetings with departed loved ones , tarot card readings and soul healing sessions			1
and it 's a list that includes celebrity faces such as former - @entity19 star @entity18 , former - @entity21 @entity20 and former - eastender @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
psychic and medium @entity1 , left , has a celebrity client base that includes former - @entity19 star @entity18 , right ' everyone comes to see me for different reasons , ' @entity1 told @entity31			1
' and all sessions are different , depending on why they are there			0
' i tend to begin sessions by asked their loved ones in the spirit world why they have come , as that 's often the best way			2
' @entity1 - who last night tweeted a photograph of herself with @entity18 after giving her a reading - says she would never reveal anything about her clients , or what happens during a session			1
' i do have a lot of celebrity clients , including several people from the @entity19 cast , and they often recommend me to other celebrities , but i would never speak about what happens in the sessions			1
@entity18 is a lovely girl			2
' ' people may come because they 're wondering about their job , or their relationship , or they want to speak to loved ones who have passed away			0
' most people want a bit of guidance and direction in their lives			2
i never tell anyone what to do or if they are going to die			0
life is so full of trauma anyway - i want to give them hope			0
' @entity1 tweeted a photo of herself with @entity18 after giving the former - @entity19 star a reading in her home last night @entity1 describes herself as ' a spiritual supermarket ' , saying : ' you can come to me for spiritual messages , tarot readings and soul healings			1
all three in one place ! ' she says she has spoken to a woman who miscarried , and told her precisely when she would fall pregnant again ; she has helped one mother grieve over a young son lost in the @entity79 disaster , by carrying messages between them ; and she allowed one woman to forgive herself for not being by her mother 's side when she died , because her mother appeared to @entity1 and told her it was ok			2
@entity1 with former - @entity21 @entity20 , one of the celebrities she has done readings for when asked why she wo n't give people direct advice about what to do in life , @entity1 explains that ' there has to be free will ' , adding : ' i can give them only guidance			1
maybe i 'll see their loved one who will tell them they 're stuck in a rut , but i ca n't lead people into decisions that might be wrong			0
' a woman who came to see me yesterday said the last psychic she 'd seen had told her to break up with her boyfriend			0
i did n't see that at all , and i certainly would n't have told her if i had ! it might have been the biggest mistake of her life			0
' @entity1 - pictured with former @entity110 @entity22 - says she will never actually tell people what to do with their lives , as there needs to be an element of free will @entity1 gives readings in an annexe of her house in @entity9 , thus enabling her to keep her work and personal lives separate			1
but juggling the roles of psychic and mother has n't always been easy			0
when she first began doing readings @entity1 's son , now 16 , asked ' why i could n't work in @entity126 like all the other mums '			1
but now they 're older - her other children are 21 and 18 - they are very supportive of what she does			2
' i support @entity131 so do charity readings at matches , and now my son is pleased he gets free merchandise ! ' @entity1 with @entity137 actress @entity136 , who has received readings from the psychic , left , and @entity1 outside her beloved @entity140 , right but when it comes to reading her own family , @entity1 is hesitant			1
' i never do readings for my husband or family : emotion clouds judgement			2
i did tarot with my eldest daughter once to give her some direction , and i do my husband once a year , but i do n't tune into my kids			0
' they have to be allowed to have secrets , there has to be something personal			0
to my kids i 'm just mum , and we 're the last people to know if they have a girlfriend or boyfriend ! ' @entity1 is now planning on running spiritual retreats to teach people how to give readings			1
