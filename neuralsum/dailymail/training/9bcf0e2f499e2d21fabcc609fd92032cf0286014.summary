by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent fragile : civil partnerships have begun to break up at the same rate as marriages civil partnerships have begun to break up at a speed approaching the divorce rates of heterosexual couples			1
the number of partnerships legally dissolved in @entity11 and @entity12 shot up by 20 per cent last year and has more than doubled in three years			1
analysts said the figures could suggest that some civil partners – among whom the longest - lasting partnerships have been registered for just under eight years – are experiencing the ‘ seven - year itch ’			1
however , while for heterosexual couples the peak age of divorce is the early 40s , for same - sex civil partners – who typically legalise their relationships at a much older age than heterosexuals – the highest level of break - ups is among younger people , especially among women in their 20s and 30s			2
nearly a third of all the civil partners who ended their partnership last year were women under 40			2
the average age of a civil partner whose relationship dissolved in @entity11 last year was actually younger than the average age at which gay or lesbian couples register a civil partnership			0
lawyers said the growing number of dissolutions meant partnership break - ups were comparable with divorce			0
the @entity48 said the number of civil partnerships celebrated in 2012 was 7,037 , an increase of 3.6 per cent on 2011			1
dissolutions in 2012 rose by 20 per cent , to 794 from 663 in 2011			0
@entity53 of @entity54 said : ‘ the likelihood of civil partnerships experiencing a seven - year itch should perhaps not come as that much of a surprise given that the issues which the couples involved face are broadly the same as those who are married			1
equality : although the rates of dissolution are proving the same , civil partnerships break up at a younger age than marriages ‘ the greatest possibility of husbands and wives divorcing occurs when they have been married between four and eight years and these new figures fit that pattern for civil partners too			1
’ ‘ more than half the dissolutions recorded in 2012 ended female partnerships and women were almost twice as likely as men to break up a civil partnership			0
’ @entity80 of @entity81 said : ‘ the number of civil partnerships that have taken place is reaching a substantial critical mass now and it is expected that these relationships will follow the general trends of marriage and divorce			1
‘ it is a common generalisation that there is a seven - year itch when relationships supposedly become more difficult			1
‘ in reality , it is often a few years into relationships that couples think about separating as things may not have worked out as planned			0
' same issues ' : a divorce expert said the phenomenon is unsurprising since same - sex couples face similar problems to heterosexual ones ' the statistics show that the first 10 years are the most vulnerable in a marriage , and the same seems to be true of civil partnerships			1
’ civil partnership dissolution rates remain below those of marriage – 3.2 per cent of male and 6.1 per cent of female partnerships have broken up in @entity11 and @entity12 – but the pattern appears close to that of divorce among heterosexual married couples			0
overall , 455 female partnerships ended in 2012 and 339 male partnerships			0
the figures apply only to @entity11 and @entity12 because 2012 figures for @entity119 remain unpublished			0
the average age of someone whose partnership was dissolved in @entity11 and @entity12 last year was 38.6 - while the average age of someone registering a civil partnership in @entity11 was 38.9			0
the @entity48 said : ‘ the rising number of dissolutions is a consequence of the increasing number of civil partners living in the @entity131			2
’ overall , 60,454 civil partnerships have been registered since 2005			2
laws allowing same - sex marriage come into effect next year .			0

new figures show the number of ended partnerships shot up by 20 per cent
analysts suggest the ' seven year itch ' is rearing its head - eight years after civil partnerships were first established
figures , released by the @entity48 , also show that people in civil partnerships separate younger than those in marriages
