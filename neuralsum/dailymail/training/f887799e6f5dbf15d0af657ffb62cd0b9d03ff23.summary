an ambulance service has apologised to an elderly woman suffering a brain haemorrhage who was forced to wait for almost an hour and a half for an emergency crew to arrive			2
@entity6 , 64 , started feeling sick and getting headaches before collapsing at her home in @entity9 , @entity10 , prompting family members to immediately dial 999			1
however , an ambulance failed to reach the grandmother until 86 minutes later , during which time her concerned family made two more 999 calls			1
brain haemorrhage : @entity6 ( left ) felt sick and had headaches before collapsing at her home			1
her husband @entity19 ( right ) has since received an apology letter from @entity21 following an investigation into the incident , it emerged an ambulance originally dispatched to mrs @entity6 was diverted elsewhere			1
the enquiry also found the worker who took their call failed to find out enough about mrs @entity6 ’s condition before deciding how best to treat the situation			1
the family spoke to an @entity34 call handler tasked to receive 999 calls from the public and take essential details about the patient ’s condition and their exact location			1
however , the investigation found mrs @entity6 ’s condition should have been ‘ further probed ’ over the phone			1
that worker has now been given further training			2
@entity21 ( @entity21 ) has now written to her husband @entity45 - who has had to quit his career to become her full - time carer - to offer its ‘ sincere apologies ’			2
mr @entity45 , 63 , a coach driver for the @entity50 , said : ‘ i ’m not very happy			2
it seems @entity21 is just going through the motions to keep me happy			2
‘ it seems they are just making excuses for their incompetence			0
that said , however , there ’s not a lot of point in pursuing the matter any further as @entity21 is n’t going to change what it ’s already said and we ’ll just have to accept this and get on with it			0
‘ hopefully @entity21 will take more care with the way calls are handled			0
’ since her collapse at her £ 87,000 one - bedroom flat home in @entity9 , mrs @entity6 has continued to receive hospital treatment for her brain haemorrhage			1
in fact , mr @entity45 had been admitted to hospital hours before his wife , who retired in may , after being diagnosed with pneumonia and pleurisy			0
the couple , who have two children and five grandchildren together , were both eventually transferred from @entity83 to @entity84			0
when his wife fell ill , their daughter @entity85 , 40 , who lives nearby in @entity87 , @entity88 , was able to drive to their home and call 999 - which she then did twice more			1
treatment : mrs @entity6 was eventually taken to and treated at @entity83 ( pictured ) in @entity93 , @entity10 , after her family had made a total of three separate 999 calls a little over a week after being first admitted to hospital , mrs @entity6 , a former medical secretary , had brain surgery and was kept at @entity84 for three weeks			1
after coming out , she was re-admitted several weeks later when she suffered from vertigo , her husband said			0
he added : ' luckily they were very good at the hospital			0
i do n't believe the delay impacted on her condition and she 's been improving steadily			2
‘ i myself had chest pains that morning and went to hospital but @entity6 messaged me to say she was ill. our daughter came round from @entity87 who called for the ambulance			1
‘ it 's been a little bit awkward these past four months as i have been doing everything for her and running around after her			0
fortunately it 's not so bad now as she 's getting more mobile			0
it 's not how we planned to start our retirement together			0
’ in a letter to mr @entity45 , who complained about the treatment of his wife , the ambulance trust admitted failing to meet the targeted response time of 30 minutes			0
it admitted the first call was made at 11.53am on september 7 this year by mrs @entity6 ’s family and that a clinician called the family back at 12.40pm when they were able to do so			1
the clinician told the family an ambulance would be sent out and with them within 30 minutes and one was dispatched at 1.05pm			2
but it was diverted to another emergency just two minutes later at 1.07pm			0
at 1.12pm another ambulance was sent and reached mrs @entity6 at 1.19pm , 39 minutes after the family was told one was coming and 86 minutes after the first 999 call			1
eventually , she was taken to and treated at @entity83 in @entity93 , @entity10 , after her family had made a total of three separate 999 calls			1
in its apology for its shortfalls , @entity21 also said a rapid response vehicle was not sent out throughout this time as none were available			0
@entity148 , assistant director of operations , wrote to her husband : ‘ i would firstly like to offer you my sincere apologies for the distress caused because of this incident , not only for your wife but also to you and your daughter who was with your wife at the time			0
‘ i would also like to apologise for the delay in responding to you			0

@entity6 started feeling sick and getting headaches at home
she then collapsed , prompting family members to immediately dial 999
@entity167 did n't reach grandmother in @entity9 for another 86 mins
