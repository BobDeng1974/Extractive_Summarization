from @entity4 's lush blonde locks to @entity7 's @entity6 girl tresses , many in the world of showbiz have received a helping hand from @entity10 hair extensions			1
the top - quality @entity12 specialists are pioneering a pre-taped application method - which essentially involves attaching extensions to your real hair using a strip of , essentially , sticky tape			1
many say this method is , for @entity21 hair , trumping micro-rings , weaves and even keratin bonds			1
long locks : @entity26 pictured after having the extensions - which are a great colour match - put in @entity26 's locks ( before , left ) was transformed with extensions ( right ) pre-tapes are said to score higher for a seamless look			1
they lie flat on the head so there are no lumps or bumps , have a weightless feel , and are easy to apply			1
it takes just 40 minutes for a whole head			0
i 've got lots of hair but it 's fine and , thanks to bleaching my whole head for the best part of a year ( i 'm a sensible ombré now ) , loads of it is now short and many of the strands are broken			1
i was wary of having hair extensions as i have read the horror stories - matting at the roots , the wrong type of glue used , bald patches and head - shaving			1
and i hate the look of clumps of hair that can be created with micro-rings			0
a high pony stays up and in place during hours of gruelling workouts at the gym but with @entity66 i was convinced they were risk - free enough to give them a try			1
i was in and out of the salon - hair going from limp and average to full , curly and glamorous - in just an hour			2
pre-taped extensions take just 40 minutes to apply , then just add on some time for washing and styling the hair			2
for the application process , there 's no stress on the scalp as the tapes are flat and comfortable			1
they feature a polyurethane base with integrated hair , and have a polyester film for applying the acrylic base			0
this makes them transparent , flexible and very resistant			0
the film comes off the tape , it 's stuck behind the hair , then a double flap comes over to seal the extension			2
@entity66 's pre tapes are unique in that they have an indentation in the middle of the tape for clear and precise application - plus curved edges for scalp comfort			1
they should only ever be applied by a professional			0
once they 're in , it 's up to you to make sure they stay looking gorgeous			0
the main thing to consider is caring for the hair properly - do n't coat it in shine - sucking sulphates or use the wrong brush , for example ( more on aftercare below )			2
the film comes off the tape , it 's stuck behind the hair , then a double flap comes over to seal the extension for the application process , there 's no stress on the scalp as the tapes are super flat and comfortable if you lift your hair to reveal them they can contrast with the root , but look fabulous when the hair comes over several weeks in , @entity26 wears her hair in all sorts of styles and the tapes continue to stay discreetly in place @entity134 , the hair extension technician from @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity138 , who did my hair , is a huge fan of pre-tapes for the speed of application , plus the high quality of the brand 's @entity147 hair			1
' i use @entity66 pre taped extensions because of how quick they are to apply , ' he says			1
' most people lead busy lifestyles and many do n't have the time it takes to apply traditional extensions			0
these extensions are luxurious and soft , i love using the @entity147 hair for my clients			2
' he has said that the best colour combination is when you mix two or even three shades to get a really natural look , and you can create the ombré look very easily by adding a blonde along with your natural colour			0
@entity134 said he favours a mix of application methods - pre tapes plus a few bonds near the hairline - for the ultimate best result			1
i have to say though so far , three weeks in , i wear my hair up and down , straight and curly , and the tapes hardly ever poke through			2
and not one has fallen out			0
revealing the tapes , they do look garish next to my root colour , but when it 's tied up it looks very natural letting the hair dry naturally it goes into lovely soft beachy waves - and you ca n't see the tapes when it 's up ethically sourced , the brand 's pre taped extensions are reusable and suitable for all hair types - including very fine hair			1
@entity66 won @entity189 in the @entity190 , and the brand is taking the industry by storm			2
as well as glamorous celebrities it 's working women who are buying into the pre tape takeover			2
the luxury hair extensions label have seen a soaring demand for these particular extensions as time - poor women seek out quicker ( and cheaper ! ) extensions solutions			1
make the most of your extensions by taking good care of them hair extensions require some maintenance and care			1
once you have had them fitted your stylist will guide you through how best to look after your new hair			0
extensions are often costly and can take a while to attach , so it 's important to look after them properly			2
make the most of your extensions by taking good care of them and using the correct products			0
correct aftercare is just as important as going to a specialist who can fit the extensions correctly in the first place			0
reduce the amount you wash your hair if you can washing hair too much - more than three times a week - can put too much stress on the extensions due to excessive heat and styling			1
@entity234 sulphate hair products it is important to only use a shampoo and conditioner that your stylist says is safe for hair extensions			1
many brands contain lots of sodium chloride ( salt ) which will dry out your hair and silicone based ingredients which can cause some bonds to weaken and break down			0
continue conditioning you also need to keep your hair in really good condition by using a moisturising conditioner			0
however , only condition from the mid lengths to the end of the hair			0
do not apply any conditioner to the area where the extensions are attached as this could cause them to weaken			0
take care drying and styling the hair is at its weakest when wet so ensure it is dried gently and handled carefully			0
sleep with it tied in a scrunchie tie your hair back in a loose ponytail or plait using a soft scrunchie for bed so it does n't get tangled			0
beware the three month rule never wear your extensions for longer than 3 months continuously without maintenance as during this time your hair will have grown by approx 1.5 inches and the roots of your hair will start to tangle			1
brushing remember your extensions are attached to your own natural hair , pulling too hard or mistreating your extensions can result in your own hair being pulled out			0
the only brush you should use near to your extension bonds is an extension brush with soft loop bristles or a @entity280			0
when brushing the extensions always hold the where the extensions are attached making sure no additional stress is put on the hair			2
