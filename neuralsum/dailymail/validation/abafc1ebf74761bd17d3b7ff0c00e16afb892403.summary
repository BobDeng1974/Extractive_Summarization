at the time sgt @entity24 said : ' there were no injuries that looked like they would cause a person ’s death			1
' but the death was ruled accidental this week after a @entity32 medical officer said ms @entity2 undressed in a ' very sad ' and ' unusual ' case			1
paradoxical undressing can occur in cases of severe hypothermia when the confused victim begins to feel as if they are burning up and therefore removes their clothing			1
the crashed @entity42 sedan was first reported around 8:30am on january 13 by resident @entity43 , who spotted the car after dropping her kids off at school			1
' there 's always deer in that field , ' ms @entity43 said			2
' i was looking for the deer and i saw the car			1
it was against a tree and the hood was smashed in and the driver 's side door was open			2
' i was hollering asking if everybody was okay , hoping if somebody was in there that they could at least respond			2
' since ms @entity43 had a child in the car at the time , she could n't get out to approach the car , but called police and stayed until they showed up			2
while the airbags were deployed , police found the vehicle empty			2
ms @entity2 and her daughter were found about 200 yards away from a crashed silver car it was n't until a man came to repair a fence at 11am that the bodies were found			1

you ’ve probably thought them before too			0
why do we even bother thinking that ? he already had a path			0
' it ’s our scared insecure brains that try to tie all the knots of false insecurity together into believing that we are going to be ok because of our ‘ plan '			0
even though , constantly , again and again , our plan fails , falls apart , crumbles , vanishes			0
but @entity91 ’s plans are always solid			0
he always follows through and takes care of us			0
mystery : the medical examiner 's office said that ms @entity2 ( left ) paradoxically undressed before lying on top of her daughter ( right ) ' please pray for me and my family			1
my husband and i are going back to no home , no job , and pregnant			0
' after the incident hundreds of friends posted memorials to ms @entity2 on her @entity77 page			0

' @entity2 was found naked , with a trail of clothes from the car suggesting she disrobed as she walked away from the vehicle @entity142 , who lives next door to the mother 's parents , said she was ' just horrified ' to hear about @entity2 's death			1
' i wanted to tell her how sorry i was that this has happened to that lovely family , ' @entity142 told @entity150			0
resident @entity151 is confused , like many in the community			2
she said : ' it ’s perplexing , the fact the bodies were away from the car , you think they would have been in the car			1

@entity10 was found with her 13 - month - old baby @entity13
her crashed car was found 200 yards away from their dead bodies
did not seem to have substantial injuries - besides a few scratches
medical examiner said 27 - year - old paradoxically undressed
a hypothermic person can become confused and feel like they are burning
