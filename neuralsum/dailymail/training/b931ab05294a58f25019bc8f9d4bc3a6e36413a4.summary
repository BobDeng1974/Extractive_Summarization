as most adventurous travellers know , when exploring the far and remote corners of the world , it can be difficult to communicate clearly			0
try as we might to understand the local rhetoric and interact effectively , there 's still something to be said for those hilarious moments of misunderstanding			0
one of the instances most easy ( and most fun ) to misinterpret ? signage gone wrong			1
pictured : a hotel sign points out the obvious in @entity21 , @entity22 although the prices are unclear , a @entity25 cafe 's tasteless coffee option seems far less appetising in @entity28 , @entity29 , this sign does n't do a very good job of keeping this top - secret location under wraps and that is the topic of @entity19 's latest book : @entity34 : absurd and @entity35			1
author and travel writer @entity14 has collected more than 160 photographs and 25 illustrations for the book , priced at £ 6.99 - and they vary from the ironic to the extremely confusing			1
mr @entity14 , based in @entity40 , has been living abroad and travelling for the past 20 years , in more than 120 countries			2
in the introduction to the book , he writes : ' just when i think i ’ve seen every awkwardly compromised stick figure , bizarre warning , or confounding place name , a new one comes along			0
for those who enjoy living life on the edge , this sign in @entity53 , @entity54 , is made for you this sign in @entity57 , @entity58 , has us asking : how much do new rainbows go for ? it 's clear from this @entity62 , @entity64 sign that reverend @entity65 is one very content fellow ' that is , new hilarious signs are going up all the time			1
at times , it seems like a race between the people who put up these ridiculous signs and those who try to photograph them			0
' over the last 20 years , i 've gathered well over 50,000 sign photos from well - travelled amateur and professional photographers			2
' trying to decide which is unintentially funny enough to merit inclusion in a @entity34 book has been a challenge			0
' trying to select favourites among those for this ' ultimate collection ' has been downright unnerving			0
' in @entity85 , @entity86 , the definition of the word ' bottomless ' clearly means 65 feet @entity90 pedestrians are a problem when it rains , according to this grammar fail in @entity94 , @entity95 a local dental clinic in @entity98 , @entity96 sure does n't do much to assure nervous patients in @entity101 , @entity102 , drivers are encouraged never to settle for second best ironically , the view of this @entity105 sign is anything but clear commuters in @entity108 , @entity109 , are warned of some major delays with this hilarious sign ears too floppy ? nose too long ? according to this sign in @entity115 , @entity116 , there are people here to help			1
