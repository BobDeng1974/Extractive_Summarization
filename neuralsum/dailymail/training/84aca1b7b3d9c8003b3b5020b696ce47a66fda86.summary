@entity0 made @entity2 the most expensive defender in the history of @entity5 football after paying £ 31.9million to sign the @entity7 centre back from @entity8			1
@entity2 ’s protracted move to the @entity11 champions finally went through on monday with his transfer fee eclipsing the £ 30m deal that took @entity14 from @entity15 to @entity16 in 2002			1
@entity2 , 23 , became @entity0 ’s sixth signing of the summer after agreeing a five - year deal , and manager @entity19 is confident that one of the most highly rated defenders in @entity22 will prove to be well worth the money			1
why the delay ? everything seemed ready to go last month , but negotiations stalled because a private company owned 33 per cent of his economic rights			2
@entity8 only received £ 23m of the £ 31.9m fee with the rest said to have been paid to @entity44			2
but is n’t he @entity7 ? he was born in @entity46 but moved to @entity47 at five , where he started as a striker			1
@entity51 converted him to a defender and sold him to @entity8 for £ 6m			2
he is one of four frenchmen at @entity54 , along with @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			2
despite his fee he could n’t get a game for @entity60 at the @entity61 and was their fourth - choice centre back			2
did n’t @entity16 want him ? and @entity63			2
asked about his preference in may , he said : ‘ @entity0 or @entity63 ? @entity63 because it ’s @entity66			1
’ did n’t @entity22 cap @entity0 ’s net spend this summer at £ 49m ? yes , and they ’ve spent £ 49.9m on @entity2 , @entity33 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
@entity55 was free and @entity71 is on loan			2
they got £ 10m from @entity74 for @entity75 and £ 12m will follow when @entity76 joins @entity77			2
@entity2 has the tools — power , pace and composure — to be the ideal partner for @entity83			1
@entity84 ‘ i ’m delighted to have added a player of @entity2 ’s quality in the squad , ’ said @entity19 , who saw his defence struggle in the 3 - 0 defeat by @entity87 in sunday ’s @entity88			1
‘ he is already a fine player but in my opinion he has all the mental , physical , technical and tactical attributes to become one of @entity22 ’s very best defenders			2
‘ @entity2 is a player i believe will make an immediate impact in the @entity11 , thanks to his physicality , his reading of the game and quality on the ball — i think he will prove to be a great signing for us			1
’ having first made a move for @entity2 in the january transfer window , @entity0 agreed terms with @entity8 and the player himself this summer but negotiations were held up because a private company , @entity44 , owned 33 per cent of his economic rights			1
third - party ownership of a player is prohibited under @entity11 rules			2
@entity8 are only being paid £ 23m of the total fee with @entity47 club @entity51 receiving a small sell - on bonus under the terms of @entity2 ’s £ 6m move to @entity121 three years ago			1
@entity2 , who had also been linked with @entity16 and @entity63 , becomes the second @entity8 player to join @entity0 this summer following @entity33 ’s £ 12m move to the @entity29			1
@entity19 has also signed goalkeeper @entity69 , defender @entity55 and midfielder @entity70 , while former @entity63 midfielder @entity71 has arrived on a six - month loan from @entity54			1
@entity2 also becomes the fourth @entity7 on @entity0 ’s books , joining @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 at the club			1
he was a member of @entity60 ’s @entity61 squad this summer , but did not play for @entity129 ’s side in @entity130			0
he is determined to add to his medal collection at @entity0 after winning league titles in @entity47 and @entity121 with @entity51 and @entity8 , but he admitted that it has been difficult training on his own while his future was resolved			1
landed his man : @entity19 identified the centre of defence as a problem area for the champions @entity2 - £ 32m @entity8 to @entity0 , aug 2014 @entity140 - £ 31m ( projected ) @entity141 to @entity16 , june 2014 @entity14 - £ 30m @entity15 to @entity16 , july 2002 @entity142 - £ 22m @entity143 to @entity0 , aug 2009 @entity144 - £ 21m @entity145 to @entity63 , jan 2011 ‘ i am the kind of player that comes on the pitch to win , ’ he said			1
‘ i am not giving away anything , i always fight until the end and i hope that we will win quite a lot of titles this season			0
‘ i am happy now because i will be able to start a new adventure			0
i will be able to train again			0
it was good to be on holidays , but after a time i started to find the time quite long			0
‘ i went on a run every day and trained in the gym			0
holidays are great but if the time is too long , it is difficult to come back			0
i think that i will need a bit of time but i will work hard in order to be 100 per cent as soon as possible			0
‘ @entity0 is a top club in @entity22			1
for me , it was an important step to leave @entity8 and join @entity0 in order to continue my progress			1
i want to win titles and i believe i can do this			0
‘ i am ambitious and this is why i ’m here			0
i ’m very happy to come to @entity176 because for me , the @entity11 is the best league in the world			0
it is a very intense and very aggressive competition			0
‘ the fact that @entity33 is here is better because i played with him at @entity8 but there are also other players that i know like @entity55 , @entity57 and @entity56			0
’ despite the record deal , @entity0 are still within their net transfer limit of £ 49m set by @entity22 for breaching @entity186 regulations			1
bad start : @entity69 struggled as @entity0 were beaten by @entity87 at @entity188 @entity2 is expected to form a centre - back partnership with captain @entity83			1
with @entity19 also having @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 in his squad , @entity2 ’s arrival will push @entity195 and @entity196 closer to the exit following @entity142 ’s departure at the end of last season			2
meanwhile goalkeeper @entity201 has promised he will fight to keep @entity202 out of the @entity0 starting line - up after being picked ahead of the @entity176 keeper for the @entity88			1
it was not a debut to remember for @entity201 , but the 32 - year - old @entity207 wants another chance when @entity0 launch their title defence at @entity210 , on sunday			1
he said : ‘ i want to be no 1			0
i will train for this weekend for the next decision to see who starts next week			0
both of us will train for that chance			0
but i came to fight for the no 1 spot			0
my ambition is to fight for the position and to be there when the manager needs me			0
‘ this was an important match for me			0
i had a chance to play and am happy for this , but not happy with the score			0
’ @entity201 was a £ 6m summer signing from @entity225 where he worked with @entity226 and his arrival has an ominous ring for @entity202 , who lost his place for two months last season when the @entity0 boss turned to @entity232 , who has since joined @entity74			2
@entity201 has clearly not moved to @entity233 with the intention of sitting on the bench			0
‘ we have a strong team , ’ he added			0
‘ we are the @entity11 champions , with very good players , but we have things we need to prove			0
