scientists have created a map of the matter in a segment of the universe , which could reveal how the universe came to be			2
the incredible ‘ pencil beam ’ shows the distribution of the cosmic web across a slice of the sky 10.8 billion years ago			1
amazingly it accurately predicts where galaxies will appear - and it could help us understand the evolution of the universe , both into the past and the future			2
researchers led by the @entity21 in @entity22 have observed a ' pencil beam ' of the universe 's cosmic web			1
this animation shows the slice of the night sky seen by the team			0
denser regions of matter are bright , while the darker regions show the ' voids ' between galaxies the research was led by dr @entity36 from the @entity21 in @entity22			1
the three - dimensional map shows the ‘ adolescent ’ universe as it appeared just three billion years after the @entity39 , which occurred about 13.8 billion years ago			1
using a technique similar to an x-ray computer - tomographic ( ct ) scan used in medicine , the researchers revealed the dense grid of light from background galaxies			2
the snippet we see here , though , merely predicts where galaxies will appear based on the density of matter and dark matter in certain areas of the universe - the cosmic web - before galaxies formed			1
' the cosmic web is a nickname for the way in which matter is distributed on the largest scales of millions of light - years , ' explains dr @entity36 to @entity65			1
' this pattern has been seen in the nearby universe when astronomers plot the positions of a large numbers of galaxies			0
' in the nearby universe , we see the galaxies arranged along the web - like filaments that intersect in ' galaxy clusters '			2
however , at greater distances it becomes progressively harder to measure large numbers of galaxy positions to do this kind of mapping , therefore our ' ct scan ' instead uses the imprint of hydrogen gas , which also traces matter , to map out the cosmic web in @entity86			1
' the structures in our map represent the cosmic web at a much earlier stage of its growth , when the universe was merely a quarter its current age			1
' this is made possible as the light from background galaxies passes through hydrogen gas in the universe			0
in the map the lighter areas show regions of high - density matter where galaxies would ultimately form , while the black regions show ‘ voids ’ - the space between galaxies			2
the astronomers used the @entity111 telescope at the @entity111 on @entity112 , @entity113 to make the map			1
in total they managed to observe the segment of space for four hours , although they had been hoping for longer			0
however that was enough time to create the three - dimensional section of the universe almost 11 billion light - years away			1
speaking to @entity65 , dr @entity122 from the @entity123 , who was part of the research team , commented on the significance of the @entity86 map			2
‘ at the top level it ’s a test of our current theory of cosmology , ' he tells @entity65			0
' it shows us how the universe forms over cosmic time			0
' he described the segment as a ‘ pinhole through the universe ’ or a ‘ pencil beam ’ showing its grand history			2
lead researcher dr @entity36 , meanwhile , adds : ‘ this is the first time people have used light to map the universe in such a way in @entity86			2
‘ they have used it in the past , but previously it has always been to study the cosmic web in @entity153 , directionally along the line of sight			0
’ the segment , seen here , was 100 million light - years in length , 2.5 million light - years wide and six million light - years tall			1
it was made using the @entity111 observatory and peering further and further into space			0
the results reveal the density of matter in this region of the universe , with brighter regions containing more the snippet of the universe seen here was taken 10.8 billion years ago , and predicts where galaxies will appear based on the density of matter and dark matter in certain areas - the cosmic web			1
this is made possible as the light from background galaxies passes through hydrogen gas in the universe the astronomers used the @entity111 telescope at the @entity111 ( shown ) on @entity112 , @entity113 to make the map			1
in total they managed to observe the segment of space for four hours , although they had been hoping for longer			0
in december this year they will attempt to make longer observations this is also the first time the cosmic web has been mapped at such a vast distance			1
since observing to such immense distances is also looking back in time , the map reveals the early stages of cosmic structure formation when the universe was only a quarter of its current age			0
this was during an era when the galaxies were undergoing a major ‘ growth spurt ’			0
the map provides a tantalising glimpse of giant structures extending across millions of light - years , and paves the way for more extensive studies that should reveal not only the structure of the cosmic web , but also details of how it works			1
this includes the ways that gas moved around the web into galaxies , providing the raw material for the growth of galaxies through the formation of stars and planets			0
dr @entity36 explains that the map should be able to predict the existence of these galaxies - and perhaps even some too small to see by other methods			0
and he also says it could help us understand the physics that govern galaxy formation , and even understand the future of the universe			0
‘ an understanding of the past will help us better predict the future of the universe , ’ he says			0
the researchers add they will be hoping to repeat the experiment later this year , possibly in december , and map an even larger segment of the universe			0
this is the first time the cosmic web has been mapped ( shown ) at such a vast distance			1
since observing to such immense distances is also looking back in time , the map reveals the early stages of cosmic structure formation when the universe was only a quarter of its current age			0

researchers led by the @entity21 in @entity22 have observed a ' pencil beam ' of the universe 's cosmic web
the resultant @entity86 map shows the distribution of matter in one region of space
this cosmic web shows where matter is most densely concentrated
in this particular ' slice ' of the universe it shows how such matter was distributed before the galaxies even formed
this means it can be used to predict where galaxies should have formed , which can be *confirmed* through observational evidence
it is the first time the cosmic web has been mapped at such a vast distance - in this case 10.8 billion light - years from @entity280
the researchers made the map using the @entity111 telescope in @entity113
it could be used to help understand how the universe took shape
