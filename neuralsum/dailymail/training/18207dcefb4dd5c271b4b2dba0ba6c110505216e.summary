it 's not just @entity2 ’s name that ’s long			1
in the mind of @entity6 , who exited these championships on monday , the speed of her play is on the lengthy side as well			2
indeed , so agitated was the @entity9 that she supported calls for a shot clock as a means of tackling slow play between points — a suggestion that came after something of a tantrum on the subject during her fourth - round defeat			1
the flashpoint came when @entity6 , a set and a break of serve down , took exception to the time it was taking @entity2 to tie her shoelaces			2
dejected : @entity6 crashed out in straight sets against @entity29 unexpected : @entity6 was a shock loss on monday at @entity31 ‘ she ’s taking a minute between points , ’ the 16th seed said to the umpire , who replied : ‘ she was tying her shoes			2
’ but @entity6 was unimpressed , saying : ‘ there ’s always something			2
’ she had calmed down by the time she addressed the press but still called for a measure to address what has become a serious problem in the game			1
players in a @entity47 are given 20 seconds between points , though umpires rarely enforce the rule , and @entity6 said : ‘ i thought she was very slow			1
but i guess the referee has the time on it			2
it ’s up to the referee or up to the umpire to say if she is or not			2
’ when asked about a shot clock , she added : ‘ i would n’t mind			0
i think that ’s fine			0
you have a clock and it shows exactly how much time you take in between points			0
‘ if it ’s there , it ’s great			0
if it ’s not , it ’s up to the referee to say if it ’s slow or not			0
’ of course , gripes over the time between points should not disguise the fact that @entity6 , formerly the world no 1 , was comprehensively outplayed by her unseeded @entity75 opponent			1
or that she failed , once again , to raise her game in the later rounds of a @entity47			1
surprise package : @entity2 pulled off a stunning victory to beat @entity6 for @entity2 , the world no 43 who was suspended for six months last year after testing positive for a banned stimulant , this run to the quarter - finals marks her best performance at a @entity47 and a vindication of sorts for not quitting the sport during her ban			1
she claimed at the time she had not intended to enhance her performance by ingesting the stimulant via a supplement , and the game ’s authorities accepted her explanation			1
but it has , nonetheless , been a difficult journey for the 5ft 4in @entity75 with the big groundstrokes			0
‘ i did n’t want to play again because i felt like it was a little bit unfair , ’ she said			0
‘ i was feeling that for about a month ( during her ban )			0
i was like , “ i do n’t want to be here and see the same people every week ”			0
i took off and i did n’t focus on tennis at all			0
i did n’t follow any results			0
‘ but then i thought , “ yeah , what am i going to do ? i love the sport			0
” and then i did n’t ask myself any more			0
’ tears of joy : @entity2 reacts after her stunning victory @entity31 : day seven roundup meanwhile , @entity113 ’s mission to exorcise the memories of her collapse in last year ’s final continued with a three - set win over @entity117 in the third round			1
@entity117 was booed off on saturday evening when she refused to play on because of the darkness , with @entity113 6 - 4 , 1 - 1 ahead			1
the @entity120 returned to take the second set 6 - 3 , but she fell apart in the third , losing 6 - 1			1
@entity123 , the sixth seed and 2011 champion , needed only an hour and one minute to beat @entity126 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 and reach the quarter - finals for a fifth straight year			1
she faces fellow @entity128 in the last eight , while @entity129 , a third @entity75 , is also through after crushing @entity130 6 - 0 , 6 - 2 in 48 minutes			1
the 23rd seed has not yet dropped a set in the tournament .			0

former world no 1 lost 6 - 2 , 7 - 5 in *occasionally* ill - *tempered* game
@entity138 reaches her first @entity47 quarter final
