by @entity0 ' cause of amusement ' : captain @entity2 in her ' unflattering ' army uniform finding flattering maternity wear is often an uphill battle			2
so spare a thought for @entity8 ’s military mums - to - be who are up in arms about the @entity13 ’s uniform for pregnant soldiers			1
standard - issue maternity kit , which dates back almost to the @entity16 , has been blasted for being more @entity17 than @entity18 , and condemned as poor quality , unprofessional and badly fitting			1
the criticism has prompted top brass to order a review into modernising uniforms for female troops with a baby bump			0
despite being forced to cut thousands of troops and equipment to save money , military chiefs will spend hundreds of thousands of pounds designing and introducing the new fatigues			1
it is the latest move by the @entity17 to ensure the military is ‘ inclusive ’ and does not discriminate against service personnel – but it runs the risk of charges of political correctness			1
pregnant troops in the @entity13 are currently issued long - sleeved blouses , pregnancy trousers with an elasticated waist , an unstylish beige maternity dress and a cardigan			1
captain @entity2 , who serves in the @entity43 , highlighted the problem in the latest issue of soldier , the @entity13 ’s magazine			1
she said : ‘ as a pregnant woman trying to work right up until my due date i ’m shocked at how poor the @entity13 ’s maternity wear is			1
‘ i have spent the last eight months switching between clothing as my bump grew			0
i initially went down the route of getting larger and larger sizes of standard shirt and trousers			0
‘ i then tailored my slacks myself using elastic panels so that i did n’t have to wear a pair that swamped me in other areas			0
‘ however , a couple of months ago this no longer sufficed			0
’ ‘ i switched to the issued maternity trousers but when i wore them for a whole day their elastic panel gradually lost its strength and they had a habit of suddenly falling to the floor			1
‘ my last option was the unstylish beige maternity dress , worn with beret cardigan and brown lace up shoes			1
‘ it ’s fair to say the look this creates has generated a fair amount of amusement among my colleagues			0
‘ it ’s not really a laughing matter when pregnant serving women are being denied the opportunity to look professional in the workplace			2
‘ ca n’t we be supplied with smart maternity garments that look and work as well as the standard versions ? ’ lieutenant colonel @entity87 , in charge of logistic support at @entity90 , said maternity wear was ‘ under scrutiny ’ and were set to be modernised now troops were withdrawing from @entity93			1
he said : ‘ the view is that although the range of clothing is sufficient its design is dated and its functionality can be improved			0
‘ @entity17 uniform acquisition has been focused on operational requirements in the last few years with combat garments and high profile parade and ceremonial uniforms understandably being the top priorities			1
‘ as the @entity13 returns to contingency we are looking more at workwear appearance and it ’s hoped this will include the maternity uniforms			1
’ the @entity17 said the move is to ensure that the military is inclusive and does not discriminate earlier this year , the @entity111 revealed that more than 200 servicewomen have been sent home from war zones after discovering they were pregnant			1
an astonishing 99 were evacuated from @entity93 and 102 from @entity115 under strict rules that ban mothers - to - be from serving on the front line			0
commanders ordered them to return to @entity8 - sometimes on flights reserved for injured troops - as soon as their condition became known			2
the @entity17 routinely orders around 1,000 maternity uniforms a year			2
according to the latest @entity17 figures , around 15,800 women serve in the @entity127 – about 9.9 per cent of the total			2
for the @entity13 , there are nearly 8.000 female service personnel – 8.7 per cent			2
at any one time around 500 to 600 women have been posted to @entity93 and in the last eight years around 7,000 have served in @entity132			0
no women are deployed in the units where the primary role is to ‘ close with and kill ’ the enemy , or to engage in hand - to - hand combat with the enemy			2
it means they are barred from all infantry battalions , tank regiments , the @entity140 and @entity142			0
but female servicemen do go out on patrol with combat units and risk firefights while doing supporting roles such as medics , intelligence specialists , artillery spotters , logisticians or signallers			0
until august 1990 , servicewomen could be sacked for becoming pregnant			0
in that year , the @entity127 were no longer excluded from equality laws			0
it is thought more than £ 50million has been paid in compensation to 3,500 former servicewomen who were unfairly dismissed			0
an @entity17 spokesperson said : ‘ all three services offer maternity clothing which are designed in consultation with our female personnel			1
' the current designs are from 2004 and we regularly review them to ensure they meet the requirements			0
