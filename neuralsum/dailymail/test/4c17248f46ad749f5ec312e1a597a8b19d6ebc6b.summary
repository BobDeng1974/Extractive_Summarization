@entity0 is desperate to avoid being part of the first @entity3 team to lose five successive @entity5 derbies			1
@entity3 have more silverware in their trophy cabinet , but @entity8 have had the better of their local rivals during the last couple of years			1
last november 's 1 - 0 victory at the @entity12 was the fourth successive derby win for @entity8			2
the last time they achieved that feat was 60 years ago			0
@entity0 ( right ) wants to avoid a fifth successive derby defeat by neighbours @entity8 @entity19 celebrates scoring as @entity3 move above @entity8 for the first time this season @entity3 have lost the last four derbies to @entity8 : 8 april 2013 @entity3 1 - 2 city 22 sept 2013 @entity8 4 - 1 @entity3 25 march 2014 @entity3 0 - 3 city 2 nov 2014 @entity8 1 - 0 @entity3 @entity3 have never lost five straight matches to their local rivals and @entity0 wants to end @entity8 's dominance this weekend when the @entity28 come to @entity29			1
' that 's something you want to put right , ' the @entity3 winger said when asked about @entity8 's recent dominance in this fixture			1
' it will be another massive game			0
' despite @entity8 's recent success in derbies , @entity3 go into the match as favourites after registering five straight league wins			1
that run has helped @entity3 move into third , one point ahead of @entity8 , who slipped to their third defeat in five games at @entity47 on monday			1
the champions defeat by @entity47 was @entity8 's third loss in five games @entity0 thinks @entity3 have a good chance of defeating the @entity53 champions if they maintain their current form			1
he said : ' we know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown , especially in the last few games , and add to that , it 's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points			0
' we want to keep the momentum going and the positive play			0
' finishing above @entity8 would represent a major coup for manager @entity66 , especially after the way his team started the season			2
but , wary of the fact that seven matches remain , @entity0 is not letting himself get too carried away despite @entity3 's recent upturn in form			1
@entity74 ( right ) celebrates after scoring the winner in the last @entity5 derby in november 2014 ' it would be nice ( to finish above @entity8 ) but we are just taking each game as it comes , ' the 29 - year - old said			2
' it is obviously going to be another tough one against @entity8 next week but we will prepare as well as we can do as we always do			2
' @entity0 's form has been key to @entity3 's recovery			1
the former @entity85 midfielder has been so good recently that he has kept record signing @entity87 out of the @entity3 team			2
that has not been enough to get him back into the @entity92 squad though			0
many tipped @entity0 to earn an @entity92 recall after 19 months in the wilderness , but manager @entity96 left him out of his squad to face @entity98 and @entity99			0
@entity0 is hoping his revival at @entity29 can force him back into @entity92 reckoning @entity0 revealed @entity96 did not call him to explain his absence from the 24 - man party when it was announced			0
' there was no conversation ( with @entity96 ) , ' said @entity0 , whose last @entity92 cap came against @entity107 in september 2013			0
' obviously i will always want to represent my country			0
i was a little bit disappointed not to be in the squad , but i have just got to make sure i am playing well here at @entity3 and hopefully i will get the call at some time soon			0
