she and another woman have been awarded £ 300,000 after suffering horrific injuries in the fire on september 2 last year miss @entity7 , 24 , who was working in mining engineering when she entered a marathon race in outback @entity6 , told an inquiry that she was n’t even planning to enter the event because she thought the £ 1,000 entry fee was ridiculous			2
but two weeks before the marathon on september 2 last year , she was invited by organisers to compete for free			0
she was joined in the event by adventure enthusiast 36 - year - old @entity36 and 40 other runners who were destined to run across the parched outback @entity38 of north west @entity6			1
