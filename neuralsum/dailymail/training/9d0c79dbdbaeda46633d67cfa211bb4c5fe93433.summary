@entity0 was nowhere near his best against @entity1 but he 'll soon be @entity3 's midfield beast again one day @entity0 will no doubt see his name in the @entity3 hall of fame			1
big goals in the @entity7 and big goals in @entity10 finals tend to do that for you			0
as @entity3 have rampaged across @entity15 over the last four years , their big central midfielder has been at the heart of the machine , pouring forward with the burners on			1
at his best @entity0 is an incredible sight			2
a technically gifted , adaptable and brutally strong footballer , few in the history of the sport — never mind the history of his club — have managed to ally touch , vision , energy and ferocious power quite like he has			0
this weekend , however , the 31 - year - old heads into a @entity7 clash with @entity31 with questions being asked about his contribution , and also about his state of mind , for perhaps the very first time			0
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 was n't at his best on wednesday night as @entity3 lost 1 - 0 to @entity1 @entity0 is helped to his feet by @entity3 captain @entity40 in @entity41 on wednesday night , @entity0 had a bad night as @entity3 lost 1 - 0 to @entity1 in their opening @entity44 fixture of the season			1
he looked slow and unfit , unable to cover the ground quickly enough , as @entity48 ’s team pressed hard in the opening half - hour			1
as one respected pundit said on the way home from @entity53 : ‘ @entity54 had to do the work of four men in @entity3 ’s midfield			1
certainly he had to do far too much of @entity0 ’s			2
’ every player is allowed a bad night , of course , and @entity0 was n’t alone on wednesday			2
what opened him up to the social - media criticism that came his way , however , was the manner in which he was caught on camera laughing and joking with @entity48 moments after the final whistle			2
as @entity54 struggled with cramp and keeper @entity67 sought consolation from winning goalscorer — and former @entity3 colleague — @entity72 , @entity0 exchanged pleasantries with his old @entity75 coach as though he were reflecting on a friendly			1
it would be wrong to criticise @entity0 too much			2
@entity77 and @entity48 achieved greatness together at the @entity79 at the end of the last decade and the mutual affection is clear			2
nevertheless , what leaves @entity0 open to question is his conduct in the summer that has left most @entity3 supporters asking if he really wants to be at the club at all			1
@entity0 was off the pace , by his usually sky - high standards , looking slow , unfit and unable to cover the ground @entity1 's @entity91 ( left ) keeps his feet as @entity0 makes a desperate lunge for the ball the story of the big bad footballer and the missing birthday cake would be hilarious if it was n’t so pathetic and it appeared clear all through the off season that @entity0 ’s complaints about the fact @entity3 did n’t recognise his big day ( they actually gave him two cakes ) represented nothing more than a clumsy attempt to get a new deal or a lucrative transfer elsewhere			1
subsequently , @entity0 spoke of his admiration for clubs such as @entity107 in @entity108 and talked again of his enduring love for his old flame @entity75			1
when it got him nowhere , he declared his loyalty to @entity113 once more and his world returned to normal , the only problem being that football fans do n’t forget			0
at @entity3 , they like their heroes colourful but modest			2
that ’s why they love @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123			0
@entity0 is not an arrogant footballer			0
he is a bright man and he listens			0
this is a man , after all , who returned a big tv to the shop in @entity129 after his wife told him she thought it too ostentatious			0
@entity0 smiles as he is greeted by his former @entity75 boss @entity48 after the match @entity0 and @entity48 , who shared great success at @entity75 , embrace after the @entity44 clash he behaved foolishly in the summer , though , and may be about to pay the price			1
in these pages @entity137 argues @entity0 should be given time to recover fitness lost in the wake of the @entity142			1
@entity137 suggests the @entity143 will soon be back to his marauding best and he may be right			0
however , @entity3 assistant @entity145 denied there was a fitness issue when quizzed after wednesday ’s match			1
and , if @entity0 really is n’t fit then why ? ‘ i do n’t share your verdict , ’ said @entity145			1
‘ on saturday he did n’t play at @entity151 but he only returned on friday from his national team			0
he was absolutely fit and physically is without problems			0
’ when @entity3 lost at home to @entity31 last february , @entity0 had one of his worst days in a @entity3 shirt			1
without @entity54 by his side because of injury , toure almost drowned in the shifting tides of @entity161 ’s midfield			2
on sunday at the @entity162 , @entity54 will at least be there			0
‘ the best way to recover is to win that game , ’ said the @entity164			0
‘ we have to win because there are six or eight points between us			0
we have to keep working and keep going until we are top of the table			0

@entity0 has been at the heart of @entity3 's recent success
but the midfielder was poor in @entity3 's loss to @entity1
he looked slow , unfit and unable to cover the ground he *'d* expect to
@entity54 was left to do the work of four men in the @entity3 midfield
@entity0 embraced and laughed with former @entity75 boss @entity48 after the @entity44 loss
