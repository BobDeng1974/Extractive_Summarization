three members of a so - called ' @entity1 ' were today jailed at the @entity2 for repeatedly trying to enforce @entity4 law in @entity5			1
@entity1 and another @entity7 extremist told one couple they could not hold hands while walking down the street , because it was in a ' @entity1 area '			1
the radicals also attacked a group of men drinking in the road , and told a woman she would face ' hell fire ' because of the way she was dressed			1
@entity1 , 19 , @entity1 , 36 , and a 23 - year - old man who can not be named for legal reasons were sentenced to 68 weeks , 12 months and 24 weeks in prison respectively			1
the teenage convert shouted : ' let go of each other 's hands			2
this is a @entity1 area ! ' - but the couple initially assumed it was a joke			1
they stopped holding hands after the men repeated the message - and when they started again , the car blocked their way until they let go			1
two weeks later , @entity1 and @entity49 attacked men drinking in @entity51 , shouting : ' kill the non-believers			1
' @entity1 then punched two of the group , hitting @entity55 in the jaw and knocking out @entity57 with a sucker punch to the head			1
on january 13 , @entity1 and the 23 - year - old harassed another couple , @entity62 and @entity63 , as they were walking in @entity64 - accusing @entity65 of being a ' slag '			1
in an exchange filmed on @entity1 's phone , she replied , ' this is @entity70			2
i can dress how i wish , ' while the group shouted : ' remove yourselves now			0
move away from the mosque			0
' @entity1 , an associate of hate preacher @entity75 who has declared he wants to bring @entity4 law to @entity70 , pleaded guilty to two charges of assault and two charges of using threatening words and behaviour			2
he was jailed earlier this year for beating up a photographer , and has been seen putting up posters across @entity5 ' banning ' alcohol			2
@entity49 , who pleaded guilty to affray , has previous convictions for criminal damage for painting over advertisements of women in the street			2
the 23 year - old admitted two counts of using threatening words and behaviour			0
prosecutor @entity95 told the court : ' this is a case about religious vigilantism			0
these men were members of a self - styled @entity1 who threatened , intimidated and even assaulted members of the public who they perceived to be behaving in an un-islamic manner			1
' the men accosted members of the public in neighbourhoods of @entity5 which they claimed were @entity1 areas , and where according to them different law applied			1
' radical : @entity1 , 19 , is close to jihadist hate preacher @entity75 , pictured during a demonstration judge @entity113 told them : ' one of the many good things about living in @entity70 is the tolerance and respect members of the public generally show to one another 's religious beliefs , his dress or his chosen way of life			1
' when on occasions a person shows their intolerance of another individual whether by aggression or violence and in such a way as to cause real fear to the individual then the law can be invoked to protect that individual			0
' this law would protect you if someone treated you in this way			0
it is the very same law that now brings you before this court for your conduct			0
' my understanding is that @entity7 is a peaceful religion and this conduct was unfortunately anything but			2
' @entity148 , representing @entity1 - who calls himself @entity149 - said : ' he recognises that the offences are serious and recognises the custodial threshold is clearly passed			2
' actual bodily harm were of course serious and people were harmed			0
the incidents themselves lasted for a very short duration			0
' mr @entity149 for his part felt provoked			0
he has three previous convictions all committed in 2010 , he was a drug user and his life has changed since then - he has found a religious calling			1
' he has a wife and two children , a 14 - month - old son and a daughter born six days ago			0
up until now he has been a young man who was immature and easily led			0
he now wants to work in the retail sector			0
' @entity167 , representing the 23 year - old , said : ' he is a relatively young man , he has an offending history a lot of it is prior to him converting to @entity7 - this offending relates to his religious choice			1
' he said he did n't think about the effect it would have on the victims , did n't think about the consequences and he has said he feels very stupid			0

@entity1 , @entity1 and another man sentenced to jail for 68 weeks , 12 months and 24 weeks respectively
@entity7 extremists forced couples to stop holding hands in @entity5
they also began a fight with men who were drinking on the street
@entity2 hears that @entity1 , 19 , was a drug user before finding @entity7
