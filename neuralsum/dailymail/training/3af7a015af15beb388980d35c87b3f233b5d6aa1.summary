@entity1 ’s defensive nightmare handed @entity2 a 2 - 1 triumph to extend @entity5 ’s perfect home record			2
the @entity7 defender s ​ cored an own goal , conceded a penalty and was sent off in a shambolic first - half performance to give @entity12 ’s chosen man his fourth successive win at the @entity14			1
@entity15 hit a consolation goal for the @entity7 but it could not stop their dire run of just two wins in 12 games			1
the @entity14 players celebrate after @entity7 defender @entity1 ( not pictured ) put them 1 - 0 up @entity22 doubled the lead for @entity14 from the penalty spot on the stroke of half - time @entity1 sees red just before half - time after a challenge in the area conceded a penalty in @entity14 's favour @entity14 : @entity32 , @entity33 ( @entity34 76 ) , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity22 , @entity40 ( @entity41 70 ) , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 90 ) subs not used : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity35 goals : @entity1 ( @entity50 ) 20 , @entity22 45 +4 booked : @entity38 41 @entity7 : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity15 , @entity1 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 84 ) , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 72 ) , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity62 46 ) subs not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 goal : @entity15 81 booked : @entity57 41 , @entity55 90 sent off : @entity1 45 +3 referee : @entity70 attendance : 20,643 @entity60 tested home goalkeeper @entity32 early on as the visitors found space between the @entity2 midfield and defence			1
but their bright start was extinguished by one of their own after 19 minutes when @entity1 diverted @entity22 ’s corner past @entity51 - who was yet to make a save			2
former @entity7 defender @entity35 proved a handful in the @entity7 penalty area and @entity1 only had eyes for his man when @entity22 sent his kick curling in			1
confusion reigned in the away side ’s defence and the ball had deflected off the leg of @entity1 and past the @entity51 before either knew anything about it			0
@entity94 led the search for an equaliser before half - time with a testing drive at the same end he scored his match - winning goal for @entity103 against @entity104 last month			0
both sides seemed content to head in at half - time with the score at 1 - 0 after @entity38 and @entity57 were booked for their part in a melee , but the evening was about to go from bad to worse for @entity1			0
@entity1 ( second left ) scored an own goal in the 20th minute to put @entity14 1 - 0 up against @entity7 the referee reaches into his pocket ( left ) to send @entity7 defender @entity1 off just before half - time former @entity115 favourite @entity114 controlled a searching @entity22 ball 18 yards from goal and tried to beat @entity1 , who had found himself one - on - one with the tricky attacker			1
the @entity120 international dragged @entity42 down and referee @entity70 pointed to the spot and pulled a red card out of his pocket			0
@entity22 finished the move he started by sending the @entity125 goalkeeper the wrong way to give @entity14 a flattering 2 - 0 half - time lead			1
@entity53 ( second right ) and @entity1 ( centre ) confront the referee @entity70 to appeal the red @entity114 ( left ) is fouled by @entity1 on the stroke of half - time - the latter was then sent off @entity61 was sacrificed for @entity133 at the break as @entity135 sought to shore things up at the back			2
but the early signs were not good as @entity38 and @entity40 burst down the flanks but saw their shots fly high and wide			0
@entity42 was next to test the away side ’s three - man defence as the home side took advantage of their one - man advantage			2
but @entity14 did themselves no favours as they let their possession advantage go to waste with some sloppy defending			0
@entity149 ( centre ) looks to evade the challenge of @entity42 of @entity14 @entity15 ( left ) , who scored @entity7 's goal , challenges @entity43 on friday night @entity15 got his side back in the game with @entity7 ’s first foray into enemy territory in the second period			1
@entity22 and @entity41 both failed to clear a corner from the left hand side and @entity15 pounced to slide the ball through @entity32 ’s legs to give his side a glimmer of hope			1
@entity55 had @entity14 fans sweating when he went over in the box as the clock hit 90 minutes , but @entity70 pulled out his yellow card for a dive			0
@entity94 ( centre ) battles with @entity36 ( right ) for the ball during @entity7 's match at @entity14 @entity59 ( right ) evades the challenge of @entity40 during the second half at the @entity14			0

@entity1 scored an own goal in the 20th minute to put @entity14 ahead
the @entity7 defender then made matters worse by giving away a penalty
the referee sent @entity1 off , and @entity22 *converted*
@entity15 *provided* a scare when he pulled one back for @entity7
the home side held on though , and move up to 11th in the *championship*
