@entity1 's reaction said it all			2
as @entity5 's long , hopeful punt downfield floated harmlessly out of play , the talented winger spun in disgust , shook his head and threw open his arms			0
@entity10 are better than this , and they know it			2
they were 2 - 1 down at that point , two moments of genius from @entity17 and @entity18 the difference			1
they rallied to come away from @entity21 with a point - it was a night in which new manager @entity24 certainly saw enough to build on - but all at the club know their stay in the @entity29 is unlikely to be extended beyond may			1
it is an infuriating situation , the damage inflicted by an ultimately doomed appointment of @entity34 incurable this season			0
@entity21 captain @entity35 ( right ) is hassled for the ball by @entity10 's @entity37 ( left ) at @entity38 @entity21 striker @entity17 lets fly with a shot to score his side 's opening goal against @entity10 on friday the ever industrious @entity35 ( left ) dribbles away from the challenge of @entity10 's @entity43 ( right ) @entity10 winger @entity44 ( left ) scores a stunning free - kick to level the scores 1 - 1 against @entity21 @entity21 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity35 , @entity54 ( @entity55 73 ) , @entity18 ( @entity56 63 ) @entity17 ( @entity57 94 ) subs not used : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 booked : burn , @entity54 scorers : @entity17 4 , @entity18 35 @entity10 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity5 , @entity65 ( @entity66 70 ) , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity37 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity44 ( @entity71 84 ) , @entity1 , @entity43 , @entity72 ( @entity73 57 ) subs not used : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 scorers : pennant 22 , @entity68 69 referee : @entity81 attendance : 15,994 @entity24 must hope he has the character to build next year if they do fail to perform the improbable and remain in this division			1
seven points is now the difference , @entity10 having played at least a game more than their rivals with just four games to play			2
their band of supporters in one corner of @entity38 recognise this is not the fault of @entity24 and are actually excited about what the future may hold			0
no @entity97 , no problem			0
but as @entity1 's annoyance indicates , they are all too aware that this impending relegation should not have been allowed to happen			0
the frustration is that their squad is more than capable of challenging under the right guidance , but probably wo n't have the opportunity to do so			0
@entity10 showed guts and dug in for @entity24 , whose more patient style in possession was referenced by the @entity112 ' official @entity111 account midway through this			2
it felt like a sly dig to his predecessor			0
@entity18 scores @entity21 's second goal to restore their lead against @entity10 at @entity119 on friday @entity18 slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the @entity29 match and to come from behind twice shows qualities they just did not possess under @entity34			1
@entity24 , a rugged central defender , will be unhappy with the ease with which @entity17 opened the scoring after just four minutes ; @entity67 's header was a poor one , straight into the path of @entity54 , who fed the @entity131 and he was afforded the time to pick a spot and curl beyond @entity5			1
in a game lacking genuine chances , there were then two moments of real class			0
firstly @entity44 levelled for @entity10 , bending a wicked 25 - yard free - kick away from the despairing @entity47			1
he ran the full length of the pitch to celebrate in front of the travelling hundreds			0
@entity10 utility player @entity70 ( left ) jumps for the ball and is challenged by @entity21 's @entity54 ( right ) but anything the winger could do , lanky @entity18 would match			1
@entity21 's target man - again in too much space - looked up from the same distance and marvellously clipped over @entity5 to net just his third goal for the club since a summer move from @entity153			1
those flashes from the front two rather masked what was a disjointed display by the @entity156 , still smarting from their derby humiliation against @entity159 last week			0
fans were furious at @entity162 ' lack of tactical imagination , further compounded when @entity68 gambled at the back post to equalise for the visitors in the 69th minute			1
@entity18 had been taken off six minutes previously to a chorus of boos and chants of ' you do n't know what you 're doing ' rained down on @entity162			1
the same when @entity17 was hooked for defender @entity57			2
much like against @entity159 , @entity21 's paying customers did not shirk away from telling him exactly what they thought			1
these are testing times for @entity162 , whose relationship with the fans is at its lowest ebb since he took over earlier this season			0
how he must 've prayed @entity35 did n't fluff his lines in stoppage time			0
compare that to @entity10 who , even though they will almost definitely join @entity182 in @entity183 , are pulling in the same direction			2
their new chairman @entity185 , grandson of @entity186 , spoke of a long - term vision on appointing @entity24 on tuesday , and that is something which has galvanised the place			0
had @entity44 's late header not been superbly blocked by @entity192 , the talk might have been of an unlikeliest of survival miracles			2
@entity10 's @entity68 ( right ) is congratulated by @entity44 ( left ) as he scores the second equaliser for his side			1

@entity10 twice came from behind to force a draw
@entity17 gave @entity21 an early lead on four minutes
@entity44 equalised for @entity10 with a stunning free - kick
@entity18 restored @entity21 's lead before half - time
@entity68 pulled the visitors level from a corner after the restart
