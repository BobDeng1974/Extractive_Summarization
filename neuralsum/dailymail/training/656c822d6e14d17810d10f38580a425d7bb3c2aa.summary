tens of thousands of people treated to horrible train and bus rides into @entity4 were forced to make that same journey out of the @entity6 - only this time it was somehow worse			1
massive crowds appeared bottle - necked as they waited for @entity9 trains to arrive at platforms			1
the wait was so long officials pleaded with fans to stay in the stadium and opened the tony @entity15 for people to take refuge			1
the nearly 28,000 people who took mass transit to the game were stuck on lines brought to a standstill by temporarily installed airport - style security machines that failed to keep up with the volume of passengers taking transit to the @entity6 as authorities had instructed			1
the previous record train ridership to the @entity30 had been 22,000 for a 2009 @entity32 concert , authorities said			2
sunday 's ridership doubled officials ' estimates			1
a second platform was eventually opened , but the damage had been done - 50 additional buses had to be brought in to move people out of the parking lot , and it took more than two hours to get them to the port @entity65 on the edge of @entity50 's @entity67			1
stadium officials reopened the @entity15 inside , normally reserved only for vip ticket holders , but were still charging full price for food and drinks , according to the @entity73			1
a @entity9 official said that 25,000 people had been moved only to @entity40 by midnight , two hours after confetti started raining down on the field , and called the operation a ' tremendous success			1
' it is not known how long it took to clear the transit hub of passengers ' this is a joke , ' said @entity86 native @entity85 , an engineer			1
' we 're not even from here and we could 've told you this would 've happened			0
' ' what do you expect when you do n't give people any other option to get home , ' added friend @entity96 , a project manager			2
' scoreboard announcements inside the stadium begged people to stay inside the gates to ease congestion and the @entity103 bizarrely advised fans via @entity105 to ' enjoy the stadium atmosphere until congestion dissipates			1
' this is terrible , ' said @entity109 , of @entity110			0
' i 'm ready to get out of here but i do n't know when that 'll happen			0
' it appears that neither did officials , despite having hours to react to the disaster that was the ride in			2
@entity117 packed : football fans make their way to trains at @entity40 station in @entity49 where several people collapsed long lines have come to a standstill in front of airport - style security machines that apparently can not handle the crowd volume			1
people were squeezed together in an enclosed stairwell			2
brrr : the temperature for tonight 's game is expected to be about 35 to 40 degrees fahrenheit threat : authorities say that sometimes a sniper can be more effective than an agent on the ground a sniper is pictured at the @entity139 in @entity140 @entity141 : in addition to the snipers , law enforcement officials will be using bomb - sniffing dogs to seek out any potential security threat ' absolutely pathetic , the @entity151 had 40,000 people coming on buses , they knew there was going to be 45,000 people coming out , ' @entity148 , from @entity149 , @entity150 , told the @entity73			1
' we stood in line sweating , it ’s absolute horse crap			0
as more trains arrived , police tried to thin the sweating , jostling crowd by spreading people across the platform			1
initial fan calls of " @entity167 " and " @entity168 " gave way to angry shouts of ' @entity49 , your @entity6 sucks ! ' law enforcement officials in @entity172 and @entity49 have ramped up security in anticipation of @entity175 in @entity176 on sunday , utilizing just about everything in their arsenals - including sharp - shooting snipers - to protect those in attendance from any possible terrorist attack			1
' we were stuck in the tunnel for 30 minutes , it was probably 120 degrees , ' said @entity185 , from @entity86			0
‘ people had to take their shirts off , it was not good ... people were chanting ‘ @entity49 sucks ’ and blaming @entity190			2
' adding to the confusion was the lack of communication between authorities and passengers			0
' nobody is telling anybody what ’s going on ... people are getting sick , they ’re feeling claustrophobic , there ’s no air in there , there ’s no water , ' said @entity205 , of @entity206 , @entity49			2
' the wait is incredible , we were back there a good one hour and fifteen minutes			0
' the @entity6 is what national security officials consider a ' level one national security event ' and may be a target for terrorists because of the level of attention paid to the game			1
the added security proved to be too much for many in the crowd to handle			0
' it was 120 degrees in there with no air conditioning , everybody is drenched , ' said @entity225 , of @entity226 , @entity227			0
' they even had to send in medics because a few people passed out ... i do n’t think it ’s working , i think governor @entity190 ’s at it again			2
' choked : fans are packed in tightly as they make their way down the stairs at @entity9 's @entity40 mass of humanity : people stood in lines of almost an hour to transfer from buses and trains to rides to @entity4 - there is usually no wait even prior to @entity245 and @entity247 games locked down : police officers view football fans as they traverse the crowds the added security measures also include high - altitude snipers working with security agents on the ground to make sure everyone is safe			1
if you have an active shooter or you have anyone who may have a bomb			0
snipers have a better angle then anyone who is on the ground to actually hit that target			0
it ’s an entire team that communicates			0
you have individuals who are at high altitudes inside the arena and then you have individuals that are on the ground moving in and around the crowd , ' former @entity267 agent @entity266 tells @entity275			2
additionally , security officials are reviewing recent terrorist attacks in other countries to determine how to prevent them from happening in the @entity279 ' certainly , we 're keeping an eye on activities around the world , but as of this time , there are no threats directed against this event that we 're aware of , ' @entity281 @entity280 said a security briefing in @entity50			2
because this year 's @entity6 has the distinction of relying on mass transit to take up to 30,000 fans to the game , the deadly bombings in the southern @entity292 city of @entity293 have raised worries here , said col. @entity299 , head of the @entity103			1
the suicide attacks on a trolleybus and a train station that killed more than 30 people within weeks of the @entity304 also prompted a series of meetings among the planners for @entity6 security , he said			1
everyone waits everywhere : football fans who finally made their way through security checkpoints were then forced to endure waits to get on train to the game local officials are counting on the @entity267 and the @entity317 ' to keep an eye on and brief us on those events , ' @entity299 said			1
' there is a concern with mass transit and we 've prepared ourselves for it			1
' trains , buses and cars taking fans from @entity172 and parts of @entity49 to the stadium and back again ' are going to be scanned , they 're going to be checked , they 're going to be swept , ' he said			1
in @entity50 , the @entity332 is drawing on its experience securing the annual @entity335 celebration in @entity67 , the @entity336 , the @entity337 and other high - profile events to secure ' @entity339 , ' a 13 - block street fair on @entity341			0
the department has deployed hundreds of extra uniformed and plainclothes police officers to the area			0
it 's also relying on bomb - sniffing dogs , portable radiation detectors and a vast network of surveillance cameras to detect trouble			0
in the weeks leading up to the @entity6 , the @entity332 rehearsed its response to a variety of potential threats , including ' the backpack left unsecured scenario , ' @entity280 said			2
' we are very , very well - prepared			0
' capacity : people already are filing into @entity4 for @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity49 @entity360 : the @entity6 is considered by security officials to be a ' level one national security event ' the state police plan to assign up to 700 troopers at the stadium on sunday , @entity299 said			1
a security center has been set up in a hollowed - out building across a highway from the stadium that 's slated to become a mammoth retail and entertainment complex			2
a 24 - hour @entity267 command center will monitor the latest counterterrorism intelligence , said @entity373 , head of the @entity267 's @entity375 office			0
measures have been taken to protect power grids and to make sure there 's plenty of backup energy in case of another blackout like the one last year at the game in @entity384 , said @entity385 , the @entity151 's head of security			0
' this year we 're going to try to go blackout free , ' @entity385 said			0
' one thing that i 've learned is that you do n't want to be overconfident			0
you want to prepare and be ready			0
you just do n't know what you might face on game day			0
' @entity394 , a tourist from @entity395 who attended a @entity6 party in @entity397 on wednesday , said possible threats against the @entity6 were n't on his mind			2
' if terrorists were going to strike @entity172 why not do it on @entity335 ? there 's lots more people here ( then ) , ' he said .			0

fans *poured* out of the stadium only to be *gridlocked* in hours - long waits for trains at only one train platform
officials eventually opened a second platform , but had to bring in 50 buses to help ferry people out
stadium officials and @entity103 begged fans to remain inside the stadium until congestion eased
about 28,000 people rode mass transit to the @entity6 - double official estimates - and two hours after the game they had only been taken to @entity40 , where long lines *plagued* fans only hours earlier
