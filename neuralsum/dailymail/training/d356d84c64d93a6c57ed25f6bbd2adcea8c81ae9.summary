search vessels are preparing to enter a new phase in the hunt for missing @entity3			1
high - tech equipment including sonar and video cameras are set to arrive at a site in the @entity8 , more than 1,500 kilometres off the @entity10 coast , within days			1
experts believe the plane crashed somewhere in the area after veering off course from it 's @entity15 to @entity17 flight on 8 march , with 239 people on board			1
a massive land and sea search has failed to find any trace of the plane			0
@entity24 , the first of the vessels contracted to conduct the underwater search , departed @entity28 , @entity29 more than a week ago , after work was done to prepare the ship for the sea and weather conditions it would encounter			1
a bathymetric survey currently underway is focussed on gathering more detailed and higher resolution data in preparation for the underwater search phase chief commissioner from the @entity48 says the vessel is likely to arrive late sunday			2
' when they get going , they will deploy an underwater sonar in on the end of very long cable , eight kilometres , they will tow that sonar in on a toefish , which contains sonar equipoment , close to ocean floor , 100 metres , ' he said			0
' they send out sonar signals , get them back , a width of about 1.5 kms , that will go up the cable to vessel and crews to look and anaylise for anything for interest			0
' ' it will be recorded and transferred in batches , re-anaylised so nothing to be missed			0
' the new stage of the search comes after months of detailed analysis and sea bed surveys , which has indicated the aircraft should be found along a defined arc in the southern @entity8 , where it 's believed to have run out of fuel			1
the primary search area - dubbed the ' priority area ' - is an arc 23,000 square miles ( 60,000 square kilometres ) in size , roughly the size of @entity83 , 1,120 miles ( 1,800km ) off the @entity10 coast			1
' three things that make it complicated is that we know aircraft will be found there but have to prioritise high probability areas , ' said @entity91			0
' also towing expensive equipment , we need to know closely what the ocean floor is like , the sea floor is quite complex , not just a simple matter , additional attention is needed for some areas to cover them properly			2
' ' lastly data itself requires a specialised eye to understand , so we also have the capacity to review			0
' the chief also mentioned the weather conditions , which can be quite challenging because it is so unpredictable			0
images from the bathymetric survey being conducted in the latest @entity3 search area : they provide information including the contours , depths and hardness of the ocean floor to ensure the safe and effective operation of equipment in the search these images show remnants of volcanoes , towering ridges and deep trenches that have been discovered on the seabed of the search area named @entity126 , an extensive linear , mountainous sea floor structure ' weather is improving and the course of this month is as good as it gets , make the searching as easy as possible but still big swells , storm will come through			1
' vessels will also be joining @entity24 including @entity135 which has completed fit out works in @entity137 , @entity138 and is en - route to @entity139 where it is expected to arrive in @entity141 on sunday			1
@entity142 , the vessel currently being used to survey the search area , is expected to be mobilised as a search vessel when its bathymetric work is complete around the end of october			2
' the second vessel , @entity142 will be there about the end of the third week of this month , the @entity148 in @entity149 by the end of the month to do its first underwater search			0
this bathymetric survey image shows that the depth of the sea floor in one area of the search site is -5300 metres below sea level ( purple ) and then rises steeply to -2500 metres below sea level ( red ) very few marine surveys have taken place in the @entity3 search area			1
previous mapping did not show the shape of the sea floor and only indicated ocean depth ' it 's not clear how long that search will take , ' transport minister @entity168 said , according to the @entity171			0
` we would hope , obviously , to find the aircraft on the first day , but it could in fact take a year to search the entire area and weather conditions will have an impact			2
' the chief commissioner said there are several ' high probability ' areas located that will be searched in the southern arc of the @entity8			1
' the second vessel will go to another high probability area and the third vessel will work between those two areas , ' he said			2
the area being searched for @entity3 has been narrowed down to a 60,000 square kilometre arc ( grey ) in the southern @entity8 , 1800km off the @entity10 coast the yellow markings represent the area surveyed via bathymetric surveys ' until we have more solid data in flight data by boxes no one will be able to come to form a view , people will speculate			1
' ' we want to givce some certainty of closure to families			0
the current plan is scheduled to take up to a year but we hope we wo n't need that			0
' ' there are no guarantees			0
' the search operation is a joint effort by @entity139 and @entity37 costing $ 57 million			1
there has been many theories as to what happened to the @entity3 but there 's been increased interest on the pilot , @entity215 who reportedly used a flight simulator at his home to plot a path to a remote island .			2

vessels towing high - tech equipment are *due* to reach the search zone in the @entity8 on sunday
the area , 1,500 kilometres off the @entity10 coast , is thought to be where @entity37 *airlines* flight @entity3 crashed in march
@entity24 will run conduct operations for 12 days before returning to port for *resupply*
it will be joined by two other vessels in coming days
the search operation is a joint effort by @entity139 and @entity37 costing $ 57 million
