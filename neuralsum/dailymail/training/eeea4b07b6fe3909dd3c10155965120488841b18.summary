by @entity0 published : 18:49 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 18:53 est , 24 november 2013 a @entity2 - born man , who went missing three decades ago as a toddler after his father took him to @entity5 , has been reunited with his @entity7 mother in @entity8 after a harrowing trek back to the @entity7			1
@entity10 , now 37 , was arrested by @entity12 agents last month but freed after convincing authorities of his @entity7 citizenship - only to vanish again for several days before turning up at a @entity16 church			1
the mother and son finally met each other this weekend for the first time since the son went missing in 1979 , to find they have the same eyes and nose , share the same laugh , and both love plaid shirts - even if they no longer have a language in common			2
reunited : @entity27 ( left ) was separated from her son @entity10 ( right ) when his father kidnapped him to @entity5 when he was just a toddler			1
the two met for the first time in three decades today ' we have some catching up to do , ' @entity27 , 60 , told @entity0 on sunday through tears a day after the pair finally met face to face at the @entity33 after she flew in from @entity34			1
' we 're going to do that			0
' the @entity12 said @entity10 was taken from @entity2 by his father in 1979 and brought to @entity5 , where he was left with his paternal grandparents , speaking only @entity37			1
he later trained as a percussionist and moved to @entity39 , where he built a career playing in @entity42 bands			0
he married and had two children , but the marriage did n't work out			0
earlier this month , he illegally crossed into @entity8 from @entity5 with undocumented immigrants and was arrested by the @entity7 @entity12 about a mile east of the @entity46			1
at first , he said he was @entity5 , then remembered that his grandparents told him he was born in a @entity2 hospital			1
thankful : mother and son met for the first time at a church in @entity16 today			2
they plan to spend @entity54 together with @entity10 's half - brothers and half - sisters in @entity34 language barrier : after spending most of his life in @entity5 , @entity10 only speaks @entity37 and is unable to communicate fully with his @entity60 - speaking mom			2
pictured above with pastor @entity61 ( center ) he also told the border agents he had been beaten and robbed of his money , cell phone and @entity5 identification before entering the @entity7			1
the agents checked out his story and were able to locate his birth certificate and his mother - putting the two in touch over the phone in an emotional long - distance call			1
because @entity76 speaks only @entity37 , agents acted as translators			0
' it was very emotional , ' supervisory agent @entity78 said			0
' he told her he grew up being told she abandoned him and she started crying that she was afraid they told him that and how she never stopped wanting to find him			2
' coming to @entity7 : @entity10 and his mother were finally put in contact with each other when he was caught illegally crossing into the country from @entity5			1
pictured above with translator @entity89 citizenship : after locating @entity10 's birth certificate which confirmed he was born in @entity2 , and therefore a @entity7 citizen , border patrol helped him find his mom			1
pictured above with translator @entity96 ( left ) on tuesday , @entity27 will fly to @entity34 with her firstborn son , where he 'll meet her four other grown children , three brothers and a sister			0
' we 'll spend @entity54 with so much to give thanks for , ' @entity27 said			0
' it 's really overwhelming , sometimes it feels like my heart will burst			0
' both mother and son acknowledge they have much to do to rebuild their relationship , starting with finding a common language			0
but @entity27 pointed at @entity76 's plaid shirt , and then her own , and they both laughed the same laugh			0
' we are the same blood , ' @entity27 said			0
' we can figure out the rest			0
' father : @entity10 holds a child from the church 's daycare			2
he has two children of his own in @entity5 , but is no longer married to their mother			2

@entity10 , now 37 , was born in @entity2 , but taken to @entity5 as a toddler by his father
he reunited with his mother today , 60 - year - old @entity27 , for the first time in more than three decades
the two were reunited when @entity10 illegally crossed into the country from @entity5 and was caught by border control
when he told then he was an @entity7 citizen , they located his birth certificate and helped him find his mother
