by @entity0 published : 11:39 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 18:03 est , 29 december 2012 hauling heavy luggage through rush hour crowds for eight hours a day was never @entity4 's idea of a career			1
following the sudden and tragic death of her husband however , she had no choice			2
@entity4 , 40 , lost her husband , @entity9 , a licensed railway porter at the @entity11 railway station , in april this year			1
her world has never been the same since			0
' perhaps this is my destiny that i have to start afresh from where my husband @entity9 left , ' she said stoically			2
@entity4 , 40,is the only female porter in her city hard physical work like this is not what @entity4 had envisioned for herself porters must pass strenuous physical tests before being given a license @entity4 was married to @entity9 in @entity25 village in @entity27 district of @entity28 13 years ago , and they were living since then in a house that @entity9 owned near the @entity32 bridge			1
the couple has a son , @entity34 , who is 12 - years - old			2
' in march 2012 misfortune struck our family			0
my husband fell ill and died in april			2
' the initial shock of my husband 's death shattered my world			1
' but then i gathered myself and decided to carry on with the life , not for myself but for the sake of my son for whom my husband had nursed many dreams , ' she said			1
@entity4 wants her son to study hard and achieve great things			1
if doing hard physical work , and long hours , on @entity11 's bustling platforms means that her son is able to build himself a future for himself , then all the suffering of the last six months will not have been in vain			1
@entity4 is pictured here with one of her many hundreds of customers at the station some women apply for jobs on the station 's platform but @entity4 is the only one to have accepted employment at @entity11 @entity4 is determined to keep working to give her son an education ' i have no idea as to what fate holds for me , but if i can get my son educated and make him stand on his feet , i shall have the satisfaction of being a good mother and also having fulfilled the wishes of my husband , ' she said			1
though @entity4 only started working as a porter in november , any initial apprehensions she may have had in approaching passengers alighting from trains has now changed into a visible sense of confidence			1
there is no doubt , however , that the sight of a woman carrying heavy baggage remains a strange one to regular passengers			0
being a luggage porter is not an easy job to get			0
it requires a vigorous physical test in order to get an official license			0
senior divisional commercial manager @entity91 said there was no gender bias for recruitment of women as porters			0
for whatever reason , however , women as a rule do not come forward for jobs			0
' during fitness tests conducted at several major railway stations a couple of months ago for recruitment of licensed porters , quite a few women had appeared and some of them had cleared the fitness test			0
but none of them appeared at the time of the final recruitment , ' he said			0
mr @entity91 said there was no practice of giving the jobs to family members on compassionate ground after the death of a porter			0
@entity4 would have had to pass the same tests and recruitment procedures as everyone else			2
' the railway officials must have done the same to recruit @entity4 in place of her husband , ' mr @entity91 added .			1
