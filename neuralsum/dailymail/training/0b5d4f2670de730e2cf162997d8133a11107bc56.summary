the @entity8 , @entity9 - based chain of @entity11 fast - food restaurants threatened to take the condiment off the menu because of the rising price of avocados			1
while the avocado crop is currently fine , scientists at @entity17 are predicting drier temperatures will lead to a 40 per cent drop in @entity22 's avocado crop over the next 32 years			1
most modern scientists agree that there is a direct correlation between the increase of droughts and global warming , according to @entity29			2
sad news for lunch : @entity11 fast - food chain @entity4 is threatening to take guacamole off the menu due to the rising price of avocados ' increasing weather volatility or other long - term changes in global weather patterns , including any changes associated with global climate change , could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients , ' the chain wrote in their annual report released last month			2
bad weather : scientists are predicting a 40 per cent drop in avocado production over the next 32 years ' in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items , such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas , rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients			1
' any increase in avocado prices impacts @entity4 , which uses an estimated 97,000 pounds of the fruit a day to make guacamole - adding up to 35.4million pounds of avocados a year			1
@entity4 has made a promise to its customers to source ingredients from organic , local and sustainable sources , which means the cost of their ingredients are already more expensive than other chains			0
even if the avocado crop is somehow unaffected , there 's always rising prices of the chain 's other ingredients - such as beef - which could nudge the already - pricy guacamole off the menu			2
however , the chain has made clear that they do n't want to take guacamole off the menu and that doing so would hurt their business			0
' any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales , and could also have an adverse impact on our brand , ' the report read			0
for now , the forecasted guacamole apocalypse may only affect @entity4 restaurants in @entity22			0
drought conditions are already hurting produce production in the region , and @entity4 sources its food from farms within 350 miles of where it will be served			0
