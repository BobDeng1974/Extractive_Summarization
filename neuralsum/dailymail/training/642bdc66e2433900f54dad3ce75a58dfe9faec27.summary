longtime @entity1 administration political insider @entity0 claimed on monday that the @entity1 administration has n't been tainted by a smidgen of scandal			1
the surprising boast came during a q&a at the @entity7 , an organization he founded and leads			1
' i 'm proud of the fact that basically you have had an administration in place for six years in which there has n’t been a major scandal , ' @entity0 said			0
' and i think that says a lot about the ethical strictures of this administration			0
' audio and video of @entity0 's remarks indicate the audience 's first reaction to his insistence that @entity1 has presided over a scandal - free government was a chorus of laughs – before friendly attendees quickly drowned them out with applause			1
conservatives have made a parlor game out of cataloging the @entity1 @entity37 's scandals , with tallies running into the dozens and some organized alphabetically			1
@entity59 ultimately defaulted on $ 527 million in loans that the federal government guaranteed , leaving taxpayers on the hook for the money			0
in april 2009 a @entity37 official green - lighted a photo - op that featured @entity68 , @entity1 's private plan , doing a flyby in @entity71 past the @entity72			1
panicked @entity71 flooded the streets thinking another 9/11 - style aircraft attack was underway			2
also early in his presidency – on @entity75 – was a pledge to shut down the military detention camp at @entity80 , @entity81			0
that effort has led to 115 prisoner releases , including several later confirmed to have re-entered hostilities against the @entity85			0
last year the president traded five high - value @entity88 detainees for the safe return of @entity91 sgt. @entity90 , who is now expected to be charged with desertion for walking away from his @entity94 post in 2009			1
military veterans who return home under more typical circumstances were shocked to learn in 2014 that dozens were dying for lack of medical care through the @entity102 health system			0
@entity104 ? $ 527 million later , the company is bankrupt and @entity46 taxpayers had to cover itsload defaults the @entity107 , @entity46 ' most feared and loathed government agency , has had a bumper crop of scandals since @entity1 took office			1
in may 2013 an inspector general report found that the agency spent more than $ 4.1 million on a single conference in @entity114 that included six - figure fees for speakers and expensive video production for a corny @entity119 themed humor video			2
the @entity120 was caught in a similar conference scandal later that year over an $ 823,000 in @entity123 training conference held in 2010			0
it featured mind - readers , a clown and lavish hotel suites with jacuzzis			0
the @entity120 administration resigned over the flap			0
also in may 2013 , the @entity107 was plunged into scandal over news that its @entity134 section was subjecting @entity136 groups and conservative - oriented charities to intrusive screening and years - long delays before granting them tax - exempt status – while liberal groups were often given a pass			1
the @entity107 later claimed to @entity50 that years worth of emails belonging to retired official @entity144 , who is thought to be responsible , were destroyed in a hard drive crash			2
@entity46 had a civil - liberties awakening in june 2013 that grew into an international scandal , when former government contractor @entity148 fled the country with untold amounts of stolen data and gave journalists evidence of a massive global eavesdropping program run by the @entity53			1
called @entity157 , its tentacles reached into industry , private citizens ' emails and even the cellphone of @entity163 chancellor @entity162			0
outrage over the program put the @entity53 on a tighter congressional leash			2
' what difference ... does it make ? ' @entity171 's @entity170 still has questions pending about @entity173 , and the former secretary of state was never interviewed by investigators the @entity37 's own black eyes continued with other revelations related to domestic spying on @entity46 citizens , including members of the press			1
the @entity183 under attorney general @entity184 , it was revealed , had tapped the phones of @entity187 reporters and scoured emails belonging to a @entity190 correspondent , all without notifying the affected news organizations			2
the ensuing scandal forced @entity184 to convene apologetic meetings with journalists and news executives in which he and his deputies pledged to follow a more transparent route in the future when dealing with the @entity200			0
the attorney general was already reeling from a series of revelations about @entity203 , a failed effort to track illegal @entity46 gun sales to @entity207 drug lords that resulted in hundreds of deaths south of the border and the killing of at least one @entity46 @entity211 agent , @entity203			1
@entity184 's @entity214 instructed legitimate gun dealers to sell illegal quantities of rifles , shotguns and handguns to ' straw buyers , ' whom they knew would take the guns into @entity207 for use by narcotics cartels			0
of the 2,100 guns trafficked into @entity207 in this fashion , just over 700 were recovered			0
@entity184 was held in @entity226 for refusing to turn over documents subpoenaed by lawmakers			0
he was also accused of committing perjury when he claimed in a congressional hearing that he had only learned about @entity203 weeks earlier			2
president @entity1 's @entity231 was a signature legislative accomplishment but remains shrouded in controversy and scandal			1
the @entity173 siege killed a @entity46 ambassador ; the @entity1 @entity37 initially spun the terror attack as an out - of - control protest over a @entity239 video after the president pledged dozens of times that @entity46 who liked their existing health insurance plans could keep them under his new system , millions found themselves with cancellation letters because their older policies fell short of the government 's minimum requirements			1
those included birth - control and breast cancer coverage for men and prostate exams for women on single - person policies			2
@entity231 also became a punchline when billions of dollars failed to produce a working website in the fall of 2013 when open - enrollment for government - brokered medical insurance policies opened up			2
by then , the administration had already angered members of @entity50 by unilaterally pushing back implementation dates that were written into the law he signed			0
some of those impromptu delays pushed back key outcomes – including the massive wave of insurance policy cancellations – until after the 2012 election			0
in late 2014 the @entity270 got another chance to raise a ruckus about the @entity231 law when its self - proclaimed ' architect ' @entity274 was caught on video saying that it only passed @entity50 because of ' the stupidity of the @entity46 voter			1
' overseas , the administration 's role in failures related to the september 11 , 2012 terror attack in @entity173 is still the subject of scandal , with former secretary of state @entity171 eyeing a presidential run of her own			1
under @entity286 , the @entity170 refused to provide added security for the diplomatic compound that would later be firebombed and attacked in a coordinated paramilitary assault , killing three @entity46 including @entity46 ambassador to @entity292 @entity291			1
afterward , with a presidential election just weeks away , @entity1 and @entity286 both claimed the attack was the product of a spontaneous escalation of protests related to a crude @entity239 video that mocked the @entity300 prophet @entity299			1
protests in other countries throughout the @entity304 world did take place after the film was publicized online			0
five - for - one : @entity1 consoled sgt. @entity90 's parents at the @entity37 after giving away five @entity88 prisoners from @entity80 to get him home , but the soldier 's comrades later said he was a deserter but the @entity173 attack , it emerged after the election , was planned and executed by @entity315 , an affiliate of @entity316			1
a scandal - within - a - scandal erupted when ti was proven that the @entity320 and @entity37 insiders both edited a set of ' talking points ' used by the administration to brief @entity50 and talk to reporters			2
those changes removed all references to the @entity328 and jihadi groups that intelligence officials knew were responsible			0
some analysts believe @entity1 's re-election was cinched when an @entity333 anchor incorrectly said during a debate with @entity270 nominee @entity335 that the president had called the event a ' terrorist attack ' the day after it occurred			1
rip : @entity46 border patrol agent @entity203 was gunned down by a @entity207 drug cartel member who was armed with an @entity203 rifle that @entity46 government supplied @entity286 later raised senators ' hackles when she asked ' what difference does it make ? ' whether or not the deadly attack was the careful work of terrorists			1
more recently the president 's executive actions on immigration have become the stuff of scandal intense enough to spur federal lawsuits filed by 26 sitting governors and the @entity270 - led @entity357			1
@entity1 has begun already to offer green cards and work permits to millions of people who were brought to the @entity46 illegally as children			1
he has proposed to expand that program dramatically , guaranteeing millions more that they wo n't be deported during his term in office			0
a federal judge on monday night blocked that plan – which @entity1 himself said more than 20 times he lacked to legal authority to carry out – but the final say will rest with the @entity372 or the @entity373			2
other more minor blips on @entity46 's scandal radar since 2009 included former @entity377 administrator @entity376 using a private email address – complete with an alias – to conduct agency business			2
those emails , unlike messages archived from official government accounts , were n't subject to retention policies and could not be subpoenaed			0
@entity1 was also hammered for appointing @entity385 as his first treasury secretary , since @entity385 had failed to pay his own taxes years earlier			2
and in january 2012 he created a scandal by making presidential ' recess appointments ' of key personnel who required congressional approval while @entity50 was still in session			0
the move allowed his appointees to serve for a year without being confirmed on @entity395			0
four federal courts later ruled that the actions were unconstitutional , including a unanimous 9 – 0 @entity373 ruling .			0
