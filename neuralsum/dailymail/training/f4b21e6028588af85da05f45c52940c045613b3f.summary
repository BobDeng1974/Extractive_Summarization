walking miracle @entity1 was paralysed from the waist down in a frenzied knife attack by a love rival , he revealed yesterday			1
the fireman was set upon in the street by his then girlfriend ’s jealous ex-husband after trying to stop him vandalising his car			1
mr @entity1 , 40 , was paralysed in the attack , but is now able to walk again thanks to a pioneering @entity13 treatment			1
yesterday , he told the @entity14 : ‘ he stabbed me 18 times			1
it was a planned , surprise attack with a knife			1
he is believed to be the first person in the world to recover from such chronic injuries the 40 - year - old fireman was left with no movement or feeling from the waist down asked whether his attacker served a jail term , divorced father - of - one mr @entity1 claimed : ‘ no , he did n’t			1
he thought i ’d kill him because of what he did to me			0
so that night he killed himself			0
’ the terrifying incident in july 2010 left mr @entity1 with no movement or feeling from the waist down , and facing the rest of his life in a wheelchair after one of the wounds severed his spinal cord			2
but he made world headlines this week when it was announced that he has learned to walk again two years after undergoing revolutionary treatment in a @entity13 - led breakthrough			1
his amazing recovery has allowed him to revive his hobby of hunting and also to drive an adapted car			2
‘ physically , i feel great , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m able to walk again — and that was a very nice surprise			2
’ before the attack , @entity53 - born mr @entity1 was a painter and decorator in @entity56 as well as a volunteer fireman			1
he described the recovery as ‘ being reborn ’			0
‘ when it starts coming back you feel as if you have started your life all over again , ’ he said in an interview for the @entity61 special to walk again , shown on @entity62 last night			2
in the breakthrough procedure , cells from his nose were transplanted into the damaged part of his spine to repair his spinal cord			2
after months of physiotherapy , he sensed feeling in his legs			0
the treatment , funded by the @entity75 and @entity13 @entity76 , brings hope for millions of paralysed people			1
it was carried out by neurosurgeons in @entity81 , @entity56			2
yesterday , professor @entity82 , whose team at @entity84 discovered the technique , said mr @entity1 ’s wound presented the ‘ ideal situation ’ to test it on a human			1
dr @entity90 , senior lecturer in stem cell science at @entity92 , counselled caution : ‘ it is known from animal studies that some transplantations of olfactory ensheathing glial ( @entity97 ) cells led to marked improvements ; in other cases not			2
we need to enrol more people in the study to get a better idea of how reliable this approach is			0
’ the @entity106 behind the triumph : @entity110 surgeon ' experts ' sneered at it ’s too soon to say what the history books will make of @entity82			1
if he really has discovered a cure for spinal injuries , the professor may one day rank among the greats of medical science alongside the heart transplant pioneer @entity121 or @entity123 researcher sir @entity122			1
for now , following his pioneering surgery on the paralysed @entity53 fireman @entity1 , he is a beacon of hope for hundreds of thousands of people around the world unable to walk because of spinal cord injury			1
professor @entity82 , from the @entity84 , discovered the pioneering surgery mr @entity1 received like many of the great medical pioneers , @entity82 is a maverick			1
a fiercely anti-establishment figure — he once named @entity136 as his favourite politician — he came from a poor , working - class background and worked his way to the very top of his profession			2
colleagues describe him as an obsessive , meticulous researcher who has devoted his life to one cause — exploring how neurons , the cells in our brains and central nervous system , can regenerate			0
born in 1939 , @entity82 was the only son of a @entity152 tailor			1
@entity82 ’s father encouraged his son ’s interest in science and later persuaded him to study medicine			1
@entity82 excelled at grammar school and aged 17 he won a scholarship to @entity160 — his father made his interview suit			1
his rebellious , stubborn streak was apparent even then			0
at a time when @entity160 expected students to be single , @entity82 risked his college place by marrying his sweetheart @entity167 aged 18			1
she gave up her place at @entity170 and lived with him in one room in @entity160			0
@entity82 lost his scholarship but clung on to his place at the college			1
he qualified as a doctor and stayed on at @entity160 as a research neuroscientist			0
then in his 20s he made an extraordinary discovery			1
using an electron microscope that magnified cells up to one million times , he found that the brain and central nervous system have an amazing ability to rewire themselves after injury			2
if the brain is damaged , new connections spring up around the damaged area			0
the process — which @entity82 named plasticity — was scientific heresy			1
at the time , the established thinking was that once a brain was injured , or a spinal cord severed , the damage was irreparable			0
he turned out to be right			0
today , it appears in every textbook about the brain			0
in the @entity200 , when @entity82 suggested that brain damage could be reversed , he was accused of pushing ‘ dangerous ’ ideas that would create false hopes			1
but he was determined to show the world that brain and spinal cord damage could be repaired			0
in the @entity206 , he had a second breakthrough when he discovered that the neurons involved in taste and smell have the unique ability to regenerate after they have been badly damaged			2
in the @entity212 , he transplanted these cells into the severed spinal cords of laboratory animals			0
they did their job and repaired the damage			0
he repeated the experiment dozens of times before moving on to people			2
his pioneering work culminated with the extraordinary success this week			0
other neuroscientists yesterday tried to play down the ‘ breakthrough ’			2
but as we have seen , scientists underestimate @entity228 at their peril			0
the father who never gave up hope when @entity233 plunged into the ocean off @entity236 ’s @entity235 , life could hardly have been better			0
the 18 - year - old — celebrating the end of his a-levels in 2003 with a holiday to @entity241 — had his whole life ahead of him			1
@entity243 with his son @entity244 who was paralysed after diving into the sea in @entity241 but , as he dived into a wave , his head hit a hidden sandbank , severing his spinal cord and breaking his neck			0
he was left unable to walk , with no feeling in his legs , and little movement in his arms			1
sixty per cent of spinal injuries are ‘ incomplete ’ — meaning that the spinal cord is n’t completely severed and that there ’s a remnant of feeling or movement in the limbs , which can be built on			0
but @entity244 ’s accident was among the other 40 per cent of spinal injuries , when the spinal cord is completely severed — these are injuries that you supposedly have no chance of recovering from			0
yet , out of this terrible tragedy , an extraordinary silver lining has emerged			0
thanks to the exceptional dedication of @entity244 ’s father , a historic breakthrough has been made in the field of spinal surgery			1
@entity243 , a @entity13 former chef and hotelier , was told by doctors that @entity244 had no chance of any recovery			1
but he refused to take no for an answer			0
he assured his son that he would find a cure			0
through a decade - long whirl of fund - raising — helped by celebrity friends in the culinary world — mr @entity233 raised £ 1 million to provide basic medical research into a cure for spinal injuries such as his son ’s			1
now , using those funds , surgeons in @entity81 , @entity56 , have treated mr @entity1 , left paralysed from the waist down after being stabbed four years ago			1
like @entity233 , he ’d had his spinal nerves completely severed , and , despite six months of physiotherapy , there had been no improvement			0
his revolutionary treatment — performed for the first time — saw cells from his nasal cavity transplanted to the affected part of his spine			2
today , two years after his operation , not only can he walk with a frame , he can also drive , and even go hunting with his old friends			0
mr @entity233 , still determined to make good on his promise , now hopes that his ‘ son will be near the front of the queue ’ for the treatment			0
‘ it was the most devastating thing in my life , seeing a fit , healthy , lean , good - looking 18 - year - old boy in bed unable to move , ’ he said			2
galvanised by the tragedy , he set up the @entity75 to raise funds for medical research			1
after the latest triumph , and with more money needed to continue the medical trials , mr @entity233 has vowed to keep fund - raising at a furious pace			2
he has a promise to keep .			0

@entity53 was left paralysed after he was stabbed 18 times in knife attack
the fireman was set upon by his then girlfriend *'s* jealous love rival
but a @entity13 - led medical breakthrough has allowed him to walk again
a revolutionary discovery was made by professor @entity82
the treatment was then carried out using funds raised by a @entity13 father
