it has long been considered the most upmarket of supermarkets , and now @entity3 has cemented its reputation with a range of ‘ essential ’ items so unnecessary that shoppers have taken to the internet to mock it			1
vermicelli nests , baby avocados , kelp soap and cotton flower ironing water are among the unusual products to find themselves branded as ‘ essentials ’			1
limoncello dessert , parmesan and pâté are on the list , too			0
so are dinner candles , cappuccino mousse , lardons , artichoke hearts and cardamom and black pepper soap			0
when the essential @entity3 range was first launched , the supermarket promised customers that though prices might be lower than some of its other offerings – such as the free - range goose eggs that sold for £ 6.99 each – the range would still offer ‘ the reassurance of @entity3 values ’			2
since then , it has expanded to 2,100 items , including many that might seem more at home in a delicatessen or a niche cosmetics store			2
the attack on @entity3 is far from the first time the supermarket and its clientele have been mocked			0
in july , the overheard in @entity3 facebook page attracted headlines by revealing shoppers ’ exchanges including ‘ @entity75 , supper is in the tagine ’ and ‘ @entity78 , put that falafel down , you already chose olives with manchego as your treat ’			2
last night a defiant @entity3 spokeswoman said that rather than removing products from the essential @entity3 range , the supermarket has plans ‘ in the pipeline ’ to add 500 items to it			1
she said : ‘ put simply , if it ’s essential to our customers , it ’s essential to us			0
‘ nearly eight out of ten baskets at our supermarket now contain at least one essential @entity3 item			0
’ a spokeswoman for @entity3 defended their essential range claiming 80 per cent of shoppers choose it			1

the up - market *retailer* has a new essential range containing 2,100 items
shoppers can choose *limonchello* desert , cardamom and even kelp soap
internet critics have asked how does one survive without vermicelli nests
@entity3 defended their range claiming 80 *percent* of shoppers choose it
they said they are planning to introduce an extra 500 items *due* to demand
