president @entity0 saluted a pair of @entity2 on tuesday while holding what appeared to be a styrofoam cup in his saluting hand , a breach of military regulations that wo n't win him fans among veterans and servicemen			1
@entity0 is known for drinking tea , not coffee , when he travels , especially before delivering speeches			0
his quasi-saluting gesture was an instant embarrassment for the @entity17 , and not because his environmentally taboo drinkware clashed with the green - policy speech he was on his way to deliver at a @entity21			2
it 's customary for a commander - in - chief to salute uniformed servicemen and women who salute him first as a sign of respect			1
president @entity53 reportedly began the tradition and future presidents , both @entity51 and @entity52 , followed suit			0
but @entity0 's casual approach to the moment as he left his @entity60 chopper at a helipad in @entity62 came at a time when he had just ordered @entity24 fighter planes to fly perilous missions in the skies over @entity67			1
@entity31 predictably erupted , with most commenters expressing outrage and a few insisting that it was n't a major mistake			2
arriving : @entity60 lands in @entity62 ( above ) as president @entity0 heads to deliver remarks at the @entity74 @entity21 keynote : president @entity0 ( above ) called on everyone in the international community to cut their carbon pollution during his speech real estate mogul and long - time @entity0 critic @entity82 weighed in on the controversy , proclaiming the president 's coffee cup salute ' terrible ' in response to a tweet from one of his followers			1
the ' customs and @entity92 ' manual of the @entity2 advises that there are circumstances in which it 's not appropriate to render a salute			2
one of them is when military personnel are ' carrying articles with both hands or being otherwise so occupied as to make saluting impractical			0
' a @entity101 reporter mocked the president , speculating on the @entity104 size of his salute his two cents : in response to a tweet from one of his followers about the coffee cup salute , @entity82 proclaimed @entity0 's faux pas ' terrible ! ' @entity111 : ' raise the right hand sharply , fingers and thumb extended and joined , palm facing down , and ... touch the tip of the right forefinger to the forehead near and slightly to the right of the right eyebrow			1
' @entity121 and @entity92 ' ' in some situations , the salute is not appropriate			0
in general , do not salute when ... carrying articles with both hands or being otherwise so occupied as to make saluting impractical			0
' the @entity126 describes the correct procedure for rendering a salute			0
it instructs that when ' uncovered ' – that is , not wearing a cap – one should ' touch the tip of the right forefinger to the forehead near and slightly to the right of the right eyebrow			0
' during tuesday 's salute , @entity0 's cup was the only thing that made contact with his head			1
@entity0 made saluting news once before , in 2013 , when he forgot to salute a @entity60 guarding his chopper before he bounded up the stairs to board it			2
instead of sticking his head out the door and saluting , @entity0 returned all the way to ground level – and shook the young man 's hand instead			0
no wire photographers captured pictures of the exact moment when the president executed his unconventional tea cup maneuver on tuesday , but online fury built after the @entity17 itself posted a short video clip of it on its @entity160			1
' what 's worse ? ' one @entity31 user asked : ' that @entity0 did n't put down his coffee cup before saluting , or that the @entity17 thought it was smart to post it ? '			1

president was exiting his @entity60 helicopter after landing in @entity62 for speeches about *global* *warming* and fighting @entity170 in @entity67
commander - in - chief is a military title that entitles @entity0 to a salute , and he 's expected to return the gesture
on tuesday he saluted two uniformed @entity2 while holding a cup in his hand , a breach that wo n't win him fans among veterans or servicemen
@entity31 erupted with the president 's *indignant* *detractors*
the @entity17 put a short video of his arrival in @entity62 on its own @entity191 page , creating a public gaffe that no photographer had shown
