by @entity0 sometimes a bargain can be too good to be true			0
but frying pans that appeared online for the price of £ 0.00 were the exception to the rule after the company selling them gave hundreds away for free			1
a computer glitch at @entity10 , based in @entity11 , led to the pricing blunder for the non-stick fusion pans which normally sell for £ 18			1
cookware company @entity10 gave away 600 frying pans after incorrectly advertising them online for £ 0.00 word about the amazing offer spread quickly online and between last friday night and saturday afternoon six hundred customers placed orders , some ordering as many as forty pans			1
retailing at £ 18 each , the multiple orders would have cost @entity10 £ 50,000 to honour but the company decided to send each customer who ordered during the glitch one pan as a gesture of goodwill			1
@entity29 spokeswoman @entity28 said : ‘ we were not legally bound to supply the pans for nothing but we have decided to send one pan to each person who ordered them as a gesture of goodwill			1
goodwill : the company sent each customer who ordered the 28cm non-stick frying pan for free ‘ some people tried to order more than one , in one case there was an order for forty but we are certainly not doing that			1
‘ we do n’t yet know how this error occurred			0
suddenly on friday night the price of these pans went down to zero			1
@entity50 in particular has been badly hit by price glitch mistakes in the past			2
just before @entity56 last year a glitch at the chain 's tills meant shoppers could buy @entity58 for just 29p – a saving of almost 90 per cent on the list price of £ 2.75			1
the mix - up happened because tills could n't handle two simultaneous promotions on the chocolates – a three - for - £ 5 offer and a buy - one - get - one - free deal			2
earlier that year , @entity50 suffered yet again for a till blunder in june 2011 , when customers were walking away with 24 cans or bottles of leading brands of lager for only £ 4			2
the promotion was supposed to offer a saving of £ 4 on two cases of 12 drinks such as @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 , which normally sell for a total of £ 20			2
but when shoppers reached the till , they were being charged only £ 4 instead of £ 16			2
and @entity50 , again , earlier that month was caught out on another beer deal glitch			2
a deal offering three boxes of various alcoholic drinks for £ 20 was going through the tills at three for £ 11			0
‘ luckily some of our staff were very vigilant and noticed this quickly on saturday and were able to put it right			0
‘ the 28cm fusion pan is one of our most popular products and news about this apparent giveaway offer spread amazingly quickly across the world thanks to various bloggers			0
’ an online petition of angry customers helped force @entity101 to honour orders for @entity104 50 inch 3d plasma televisions after shoppers snapped up the sets for just £ 199 following a pricing blunder earlier this year			1
high street giant @entity108 has been left red - faced after listing a pair of sofas worth £ 1,198 on its website for just £ 98			0
online shoppers were delighted when they discovered the blunder , which reduced the cost of the sofas by £ 1,100 instead of the intended £ 100			1
but the retailer fell back on small print in its terms and conditions which it says allows it to cancel orders before they are dispatched for delivery			0
@entity108 was quick to spot the error and corrected the price after just a few hours in january this year			0
@entity127 was once blitzed by bargain hunters after it mistakenly priced music album downloads for 29p in 2009			0
many customers , tipped off by consumer websites , bought scores of downloads before @entity127 realised it was selling entire albums for less than the price of some of its singles			0
it is understood that more than 30 different albums were priced at 29p for four hours .			0

@entity10 was forced to give away 600 frying pans after a pricing glitch online advertised it for £ 0.00
the company decided to send one pan to each person who ordered the pan at £ 0.00 as a sign of goodwill
