hippos are not usually known for their subtlety but this hulking beast appears to be using stealth techniques while he sets his sights on his prey			2
the large mammal submerged itself before seemingly gliding gracefully head first out of the water			0
for a moment , its large head appeared camouflaged in the brown water and even looked more like a stalking crocodile than a cumbersome hippo			2
making a wake : the hippo glides through the water , its head just above the surface , as a small wake forms on either side of it at the @entity22 in @entity23 coming up : the surface of the water begins to bubble - up as the hippo spots a boat full of tourists and decides to take a closer look in the event , its ' prey ' was a nearby boat full of sight - seers which quickly made off when the skipper finally spotted the creature from the deep			1
tourist @entity39 , a commercial airline pilot , had her camera at hand and managed to capture the moment which happened on the @entity44 in the @entity22 in @entity23			1
@entity39 , from @entity45 , said there was about 30 hippos around in the water about 7am and all but one were busy either playing with each other or sleeping			1
ms @entity39 said : ' although we were not very close this particular hippo felt we were and began chasing our boat			0
eerily close : the hippo 's ears can be seen just above the water line as it proceeds towards the boat while about 30 other hippos amuse themselves nearby breaking mad : the hippo appears out of the water , but not before the tourist boat driver guided his vessel and his passengers well out of harms way ' sensing this our driver drove the boat away as fast as he could as death by hippo is the number one cause of death in the @entity74			1
' nobody else on the boat caught on that we were being chased and i happened to turn around quickly to see it and snapped these photos			0
' when she looked over the pictures ms @entity39 said she was surprised at how graceful the hippo looked			0
she said : ' i realised that the one of him looking very graceful in the water was very special as it showed hippos in a different way , one that was not yawning or spitting			0

as about 30 hippos played with each other and *enjoyed* a quiet *morning* snooze on the @entity44 in @entity23
one of them spotted a tourist boat and went into stealth - mode , appearing above the water 's surface like a crocodile
a tourist on board said the hippo chased their boat ' very gracefully ' , as the skipper sped them to *safety*
