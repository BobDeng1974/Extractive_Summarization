by @entity0 follow @ @ charliefscott ahead of their must - win @entity2 semi-final against @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity1 takes a closer look at @entity10 's @entity9 side			1
player of the tournament : @entity13 ( 5 games , 3 goals ) the @entity16 has been his side ’s stand - out player , terrorising defenders in each of their five games			1
he scored two fine goals against @entity23 in their first match and was also on the scoresheet in the 3 - 2 win against @entity27			2
at 30 , it seems @entity13 has got quicker with age , and his pace , particularly on the counter , has been pivotal to @entity9 ’s progress thus far			2
a goal from @entity45 in extra-time won @entity23 the trophy in @entity47			0
there was redemption for @entity13 and @entity9 in their match against @entity53 ’s side this time round , as the @entity55 winger and @entity56 tormented @entity57 and his defence			1
@entity23 never recovered from that emphatic 5 - 1 defeat in @entity61 , exiting the tournament at the earliest opportunity having failed to win any of their group games			1
deadly : @entity13 puts @entity9 2 - 1 up against @entity23 during their spectacular 5 - 1 victory in @entity61 lowlight : @entity70 ’s injury against @entity71 the holding midfielder was forced off nine minutes into the @entity9 ’s last - 16 clash with @entity71 after suffering a groin injury , ruling him out of the rest of the tournament			1
a mainstay in the @entity34 starting @entity80 for years , @entity78 ’s absence has been felt in midfield , with no like - for - like replacement capable of replicating his tenacious style			2
ruled out : @entity70 was unavailable against @entity84 after being forced off with a groin injury against @entity71 best goal : @entity56 v @entity23 , 5 - 1 group stage , @entity89 , @entity61 on the brink of half - time - with @entity23 1 - 0 up - @entity90 played a stunning crossfield ball from the left to @entity56			1
the @entity95 forward repositioned himself brilliantly to throw himself at the pass and connect with a diving header rather than attempting a volley			0
his improvised effort lobbed the stranded @entity57 as prompted chaotic celebrations in the @entity34 dugout			0
up and over : @entity56 loops a header of @entity57 to equalise against @entity23 at the @entity89 @entity105 hopeful on @entity107 fitness how has the boss performed ? brilliantly			1
@entity109 has never had a problem telling people how great he is and now he has proved himself on the biggest stage of all			0
the @entity34 has juggled his squad superbly and used substitutions to fantastic effect			2
eyebrows were raised when he hauled @entity107 off against @entity71 , only for his replacement @entity119 to score the winner			0
those same eyebrows nearly fell off when he subbed first - choice goalkeeper @entity122 for @entity123 in the 119th minute versus @entity84			0
again his decision was vindicated though , as @entity123 proved the hero in the shoot - out , saving two spot - kicks			0
inspired : @entity9 boss @entity10 has made some key decisions to help his country reach the last four top scorer : @entity13 and @entity131 ( 3 goals each ) killer stat : @entity9 ’s 5 - 1 thrashing of @entity23 was the first time @entity23 had conceded 5 + goals since losing 6 - 2 to @entity137 in june 1963 results in 9pm kick - offs : played 1 ( vs @entity84 ) , @entity140 1 , d 0 , l 0 @entity143 v @entity142 : played on @entity143 , @entity140 , @entity141 0 , l 0 ; played on @entity142 , @entity144 , @entity141 0 , l 0 @entity145 to semi-finals : group b winners ( beat @entity23 5 - 1 , @entity27 3 - 2 and @entity148 2 - 0 ) last 16 : @entity9 2 - 1 @entity71 quarter - final : @entity9 0 - 0 @entity84 ( @entity9 won 4 - 3 on penalties ) @entity152 ranking : 15th likely line - up : ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity154 ; @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 ; @entity13 , @entity107 @entity2 pedigree : winners - never , finalist in 1974 , 1978 and 2010 , @entity165 in 1998			1
