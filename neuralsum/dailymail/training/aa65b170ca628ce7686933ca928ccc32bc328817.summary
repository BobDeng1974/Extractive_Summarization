by @entity0 last updated at 2:59 pm on 31st august 2011 @entity2 justice : @entity4 chief constable @entity3 has questioned why criminals can not normally be dealt with as quickly as rioters a senior officer has blasted the courts system , asking why it could not always process criminals at the same pace used to deal with rioters			1
@entity13 @entity3 praised the ' rapid and robust ' response but also demanded to know why it normally takes courts so long			0
he wrote in the @entity17 : ' we really did see rapid and robust justice with offenders being arrested , charged , put before the courts and sentenced in days			0
' this undoubtedly contributed to taking the momentum out of the disorder – but for the police and public it did raise the question as to why cases take so long to get to court in the normal course of events			1
' chief constable @entity3 also questioned ' why imprisonment is not used more effectively at an early stage for those who make the lives of the law - abiding a misery on a more routine basis '			1
in the aftermath of the riots , courts were organised to run overnight and @entity44 joined politicians praising judges and magistrates for taking a tough line			2
in all 1,474 suspects had been before the courts , nearly two - thirds of them in @entity51 , according to the most recent @entity52 figures last week			1
the prison population has risen by 1,300 since the start of august , reaching 86,821 last week			0
there remain 1,517 spare places in the prison system			0
much tougher sentences were being handed out in the wake of the riots which spread across @entity64 cities earlier this month			2
@entity65 , 18 , who incited 2,000 @entity67 friends to commit violence and looting in @entity69 was jailed for 33 months last week , having encouraged them to ' kill a million police officers '			1
another looter who took just one lick of an ice cream he stole during rioting before he gave it away was jailed for 16 months			0
@entity76 , 21 , wandered into an upmarket store in central @entity78 after the door was left open and helped himself to a cone and two scoops			0
but despite giving it to a passer - by because he did n't like the coffee flavour , he was still given a lengthy prison term			2
destruction : fire fighters and riot police survey the area as fire rages through a building in @entity91 , north @entity51 out in force : the cost of policing the @entity51 riots is set to exceed the cost of policing all the major public order events in the capital last year braced for impact : the @entity99 say the figure will rise once they have paid the bills from the other forces who sent officers to help quell the trouble the cost of policing the @entity51 riots has spiraled to £ 34million with @entity106 expecting the figure to rise even further , exceeding the total cost of policing all major public order events in the capital last year			1
an 11 - year - old boy was sentenced for arson and criminal damage five days before getting caught up in the recent riots , a court heard today			1
the boy , who can not be named for legal reasons , stole a bin from @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118 , on august 8 after the windows of the store were smashed by looters			2
he was given an 18 - month youth rehabilitation order at @entity123 in @entity118 today after admitting burglary			2
the court heard that just five days before the offence , he was given a referral order for arson , criminal damage and carrying a pointed instrument in an unrelated incident			0
the 11 - year - old , from @entity117 , is the youngest rioter in the capital to face prosecution , according to @entity106			1
he took the waste bin , which was worth £ 50 , after a group of males smashed windows at the store , causing £ 6,000 - worth of damage			1
passing sentence , district judge @entity141 said : ' you seem to think that nobody can stop the way you behave			0
' the boy was placed under an 18 - month youth rehabilitation order , and told that his local authority will dictate where he lives for the next six months			1
he was already under a referral order , put in place on august 3 , for an incident on july 18 when he cut the seats of a bus with a craft knife and tried to set fire to the exposed foam			0
when the driver would not let him off , the 11 - year - old threw a stone at the exit door of the route 174 bus , and then kicked a hole in the shattered glass so that he could jump out while the bus was still moving			1
the district judge said the boy , who sat in court next to his mother , had been involved in a ' major disorder ' just days after appearing before magistrates			2
he said : ' my view is that the offence is a very serious one			0
if you were a little older , you would be ending up in prison , you would be looked after there rather than elsewhere			0
you need to understand very clearly that you ca n't get away with committing offences of this nature			0
' according to the @entity181 ( @entity181 ) the current estimate is set to rise significantly once the final bills from the other forces which were called in to help quell the disturbances are settled			0
in comparison , £ 34.8 million was spent on policing 42 major public order events between april 2010 and march 2011 , figures showed			1
as well as paying the salaries and overtime of officers brought in from other constabularies , the @entity99 can also expect a hefty bill for accommodation as many had to be put up in hotels			0
a spokesman said : ' the @entity181 expects at this stage a figure in excess of £ 34million for policing the recent disturbances in @entity51			1
' last year £ 7.5million was spent policing the student fees protests , £ 2.1 million providing security at the @entity203 anti-cuts demonstration , £ 1.9million on the @entity205 's visit to @entity206 and £ 2.2million on the general election campaign			1
chief constable @entity3 's comments came as magistrates rejected accusations from the leader of @entity206 's prison governors that there has been a ' feeding frenzy ' in sentencing after the recent riots			1
but @entity218 , president of the @entity219 ( @entity219 ) , claimed over the weekend that magistrates had lost all sense of proportion			0
' it 's like when you 've got sharks and there 's blood in the water and it 's a feeding frenzy , ' he told @entity230 on sunday			2
' there 's a sentencing frenzy and we seem to have lost all sight of proportionality			2
' it 's appealing to the populist mentality , and that 's not the best basis on which to sentence people			2
the norms of sentencing are being ignored			0
' but @entity244 chairman @entity243 said the claims were ' unreasonable and unfounded ' , adding that it was ' just not the case ' that normal sentencing was being ignored			0
as the cost of policing the riots was revealed a chief constable has praised the courts for dispensing rapid justice in the their wake costs : many of the officers brought in from other constabularies had to be put up at hotels for several days			1

cost of policing @entity51 riots has spiraled to £ 34 million
jail should be used for those who make life ' a misery ' , says @entity4 's head of police
