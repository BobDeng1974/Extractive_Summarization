@entity0 was accused of trying to stage - manage prime minister ’s questions last night , after leaked emails revealed @entity4 mps are routinely pressured to ask him easy questions			1
the weekly 30 - minute session is supposed to be a test of mr @entity0 ’s wits , with mps able to ask him about almost any topic			1
but a leaked series of memos reveal that his aides routinely try to take the pressure off him by encouraging conservative mps to ask friendly questions			0
the pm pronounces during prime minister 's questions : leaked emails allege that @entity0 's aides have been trying to stage manage the weekly session by pressurising @entity4 colleagues into asking easy questions the memos show that mr @entity0 ’s parliamentary aide sends out a weekly email to all @entity4 mps suggesting ‘ free hits ’ for them to read out during @entity28			1
@entity30 says that any mentions of the suggested questions would be greatly appreciated by @entity32			0
the most recent email , which was sent out last week , said : ‘ please find below some questions , should you want to take the opportunity of a free hit today			1
‘ good news on the economy features heavily – any mentions would be greatly appreciated			0
’ other questions include whether mr @entity0 agrees that a ‘ growing economy means more economic security for our country and a more financially secure future for hardworking people ’			1
mr @entity30 also suggests asking the prime minister whether he agrees that the government ’s economic plans were ‘ delivering a sustainable recovery ’			0
‘ please find below some questions , should you want to take the opportunity of a free hit today			0
' good news on the economy features heavily - any mentions would be greatly appreciated			0
’ similar emails from the past two months suggest mr @entity30 ’s pleas have gone largely unrewarded – perhaps indicating the strained relationship between @entity4 high command and many backbench mps			2
but a question asked on december 11 by @entity4 mp @entity60 bears a striking resemblance to one sent out by mr @entity30 an hour earlier			2
mr @entity30 ’s suggestions included the question : ‘ does the prime minister agree with me that the only way to raise my constituents ’ living standards is to stick to the government ’s long - term plan to fix our economy , rather than abandoning the plan through more borrowing and more taxes as the party opposite propose ? ’ mr @entity60 went on to ask the prime minister : ‘ does my right honourable friend agree that the best way to raise the living standards of my constituents is for the government to stick to their long - term plan to rebuild this economy and not abandon it in favour of more borrowing and more taxes , as proposed by the @entity71 ? ’ mr @entity0 responded by saying mr @entity60 was ‘ entirely right ’ , going on to explain the importance of reducing the deficit and continuing with the government ’s ‘ difficult spending decisions ’			1
@entity30 , left , mr @entity0 ’s parliamentary aide , whose suggestion for a ' free hit ' sent on december 11 was strikingly similar to an actual question asked by @entity4 mp @entity60 , right , just an hour later sir @entity94 , the former chairman of the @entity95 , described mr @entity30 ’s emails as ‘ depressing ’			1
he said : ‘ if it continues like that it just helps people ’s disengagement from politics because they do n’t think it ’s a serious engagement , it ’s a manufactured bear garden			0
’ party whips have long pressured mps on all sides to ask friendly questions			2
commons speaker @entity106 has warned that soundbites and planted questions have helped damage the reputation of @entity111 .			0

@entity0 's aide sends weekly email to all @entity4 mps suggesting ' free hits '
most recent asked party colleagues to bring up the economy in @entity28
but *critics* warn that the practise risks *increasing* political *apathy*
