' all 50 states in our union now have laws that treat date rape or spousal rape as just as much of a crime as rape by a stranger , ' @entity80 said			0
' we can not live in truly free societies , if women and girls are not free to reach their full potential			0
' the contrasting views show the gap that needs to be breached in negotiations on the declaration , which this year is focused on urging an end to violence against women and girls			2
the commission failed to agree a declaration last year on a theme of empowering rural women due to similar disagreements			0
@entity15 : the @entity14 helped to propel president @entity15 to power in @entity3 last june @entity3 has proposed an amendment , diplomats say , that would allow countries to avoid implementing the declaration if it clashed with national laws , religious or cultural values			1
