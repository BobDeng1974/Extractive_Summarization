hacked in two : @entity7 , a @entity1 candidate for the @entity21 , claimed this garage encroaches on his land - then sawed it in half trashed : @entity18 , who bought a house , and the garage with it , unwittingly stepped into a family feud over where dividing lines should be drawn on the estate of the late @entity33 the dispute over the property stretches back to @entity7 's father , whose will divided his 40 - acre estate into two , according to the @entity38			1
@entity7 - who is running for a seat in the @entity21 - says that he hacked the garage in two because it crossed into his portion of the property			1
' my land ' : @entity7 , pictured , hopes to be elected to the @entity21 for the @entity1 - but insists the feud is nothing to do with that @entity33 , who died in 2012 , used to own the entire estate and all the property - but gave the 39 empty acres to his son in 1978 , according to court documents			1
this left him with one acre of land , a house and the now - split garage			0
when he died it passed to his daughter , @entity58 , who now lives in @entity59			0
she sold the property to @entity18 in april 2013 - but @entity7 thought it was still hers			2
he had previously threatened to tear down anything on his side of the dividing line - and when @entity18 came to inspect his new purchase he found the structure in ruins			1
he said : ' it was a pretty rough way to greet your new neighbor ... apparently the property line problem , that the garage might be partially on his acres , was nâ€™t a problem when his dad lived there			0
but after i bought it , it became a problem			0
' there are also reports the septic system in the house has been tampered with , making the house impossible to rent out			0
@entity7 has said that @entity18 ' knew what he was getting into ' when he bought the house - and later batted away questions , saying it is a ' private ' matter which has nothing to do with his ambitions for public office			2
