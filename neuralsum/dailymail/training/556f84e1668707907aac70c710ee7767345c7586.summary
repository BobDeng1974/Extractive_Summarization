by @entity0 published : 12:09 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 18:32 est , 16 july 2012 the chancellor suffered a new blow yesterday when the @entity3 slashed its growth forecast for @entity5			1
the financial watchdog predicted the @entity5 economy would grow at a minuscule rate of 0.2 per cent this year and just 1.4 per cent next year			2
that is 0.6 percentage points less for each year than the @entity3 forecast at its spring meeting in april and underlines the mammoth task ahead for @entity14 as he seeks to fire up the economy			1
the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) has slashed its grow forecasts for the @entity5 economy yesterday the government unveiled plans to update the railways , but the £ 9billion of new investment to do so will not start until 2014 , making it too late to have any immediate impact on production and growth			1
business is placing more hope in the £ 80billion ‘ @entity29 ’ scheme unveiled last week and designed to funnel cheaper loans to small companies and home buyers			0
but leading bankers claim the demand for credit simply is n’t there because of low confidence caused by the crisis in @entity37			2
the @entity3 blames the chaos in the eurozone for its decision to lower its forecast for the world economy and @entity5			1
‘ financial market and sovereign stress in the euro area periphery have ratcheted up to end - 2011 levels , ’ it says in its summer update			2
as a result , it expects the world economy as a whole to grow by just 3.5 per cent , against its previous forecast of 3.9 per cent			1
the eurozone crisis is continuing to have a negative impact on the @entity5 economy , the @entity3 warned it believes the single currency area will be in recession this year , with output falling by 0.3 per cent			1
growth in the region in 2013 is predicted to be just 0.7 per cent			2
among the bigger @entity37 economies , the @entity3 predicts a deep 1.6 per cent loss of production in @entity63 and a 1.5 per cent fall in output in @entity65 , with both economies staying in recession next year			1
the squeeze on consumer spending continued to loosen its grip in june as inflation hit a 31 - month low , figures tomorrow are expected to show			2
the consumer price index ( @entity74 ) measure of inflation is forecast to dip to 2.7 % in june from 2.8 % in may , as fuel and food prices continue to ease			1
last month , a sharp drop in commodity and oil prices paved the way for the smallest rise in fuel prices since october 2009 , dragging down the headline inflation rate			0
inflation has fallen from 5.2 % last september due to the waning impact of the vat hike at the start of 2011 , falling energy , food and commodity prices and a number of bill cuts from utility providers in february			2
the organisation says it is ‘ time for action ’ if @entity37 is to come out of its freefall and stop dragging the rest of the world down with it			2
it calls on @entity37 leaders to follow through on promises made at their recent summit , including progress on banking and budgetary reforms			1
as a result of slower growth , the @entity3 warns the improvement in @entity5 ’s budget deficit will be slower than expected , with borrowing remaining at 8.1 per cent of total output this year and 7.1 per cent next year			1
that is 0.5 percentage points worse than previously forecast			0
slower growth means less tax income from companies and households , and higher costs for the government because of increasing unemployment and welfare bills			0
the @entity3 urges advanced non-eurozone economies such as @entity5 ‘ to respond effectively ’ to the growth crisis by pushing ahead with further ‘ unconventional measures ’ such as quantitative easing			1
it has urged @entity5 to cut taxes and proceed with infrastructure projects this autumn if growth fails to materialise			0
output in @entity5 is still more than 4 per cent below where it was before the financial crisis hit hard in 2008 - 09 and the @entity5 is among the few advanced countries where lost ground has not been made up			1
shadow chancellor @entity137 called on the government to get recovery back on track by ‘ taking urgent action to boost the economy ’			0
the @entity143 said : ‘ the @entity3 explain that “ growth is projected to remain relatively weaker than in 2011 in regions connected more closely with the euro area ”			1
‘ because the euro area is the @entity5 ’s largest trading partner we are now feeling the effect across our economy			0
‘ but as the chancellor said last week , we are not powerless to act in the face of the @entity37 debt storm : that ’s why the @entity143 and the @entity156 are taking co-ordinated action to inject new confidence and support the flow of credit to where it is needed in the real economy			0
’ the eurozone will be in limbo for another two months until a crucial ruling on the legality of its new 500billion euro bailout fund			0
@entity169 ’s supreme court will not decide until september 13 on whether @entity37 ’s largest economy can sign up to the crucial measure			0
the delay means more weeks of uncertainty on global financial markets as the credit crisis in @entity65 , @entity176 and @entity63 worsens and @entity177 plunges further into bankruptcy			1
academics , economists and citizens argue that @entity169 will jettison too much sovereignty by backing the fund and also supporting a fiscal pact enforcing debt reduction			0
they argue that the measures will undermine the power of its parliament to decide how to use taxpayers ’ money			0
the fund , also known as the @entity194 , was due to start on july 1 but needs @entity169 to ratify it			0
last week , finance minister @entity195 urged the court to act swiftly to avoid more turmoil in financial markets			0
the @entity194 and the fiscal pact are part of international treaties and once ratified , @entity169 will be bound by the measures .			0

growth in 2012 will be just 0.2 % , @entity3 economists predict - 0.6 % down on previous forecast
