by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 15:22 est , 13 january 2013 updated : 15:22 est , 13 january 2013 inside a small bungalow on the street separating @entity5 , @entity6 , from its sister city in @entity8 , a small group of entrepreneurs are working on their ideas for the next high - tech startup , tapping @entity15 's new superfast internet connection that has turned the neighborhood into an unlikely settlement dubbed the ' @entity18			1
' the home on @entity20 is one of several startup - friendly locations that have sprouted up in @entity5 in recent months			1
the catalyst is @entity24 , the search - engine giant 's fiber - optic network being tested in the @entity5 area that advertises speeds of up to a gigabyte per second - a rate that massively exceeds the average @entity31 speeds at homes hooked up with cable modems			1
heart of the ' @entity35 ' : @entity36 , founder of the @entity5 @entity37 , plans the next move at his desk			2
@entity15 's fiber - optic internet network is encouraging tech companies to move to @entity5 @entity15 headquarters in @entity43 , @entity44			1
the search engine giant 's decision to test their new , ultrafast internet service in @entity5 has had many benefits in the region the advantage here for startups is simple : a fast internet pipe makes it easier to handle large files and eliminates buffering problems that plague online video , live conferencing or other network - intensive tasks			1
though the @entity5 location presents challenges for startups , including the ability to raise money outside the traditional @entity68 venture capital scene , entrepreneurs like @entity61 believe it 's the place to be right now for up - and - coming tech companies			1
@entity71 is one of those entrepreneurs hoping to launch her startup dream - an internet subscription service for musicians who want to collaborate online - on the cheap			2
she shares the @entity20 house , known as the ' home for hackers , ' with other startups under a deal that allows them to live rent - free while they develop their business plans			2
@entity5 , @entity8 , which is profiting from tests of @entity24 with startups flocking to the area @entity15 's network was attractive , @entity71 said , because her business plan ' is dependent upon really good , really fast @entity31			1
' ' without this on - ramp here i probably would have found it very difficult to come here , ' said @entity71 , who in december moved from @entity92 to develop @entity93			0
residents here were thrilled when @entity15 announced last year that @entity5 , @entity6 , and neighboring @entity96 , @entity8 , would be its test bed for @entity24			1
the @entity44 - based company spent months and unknown sums installing optical fiber around the area			1
@entity15 provides the full gigabit service for $ 70 a month and its own cable - tv like service for another $ 50			1
a slower internet connection is free on a monthly basis after a $ 300 installation fee			0
the first homes were installed with fiber optics in the fall , with more ' fiberhoods ' planned in stages over the next several months			0
@entity5 , @entity8 , and @entity96 , @entity6 , remain @entity15 's only fiber market , though the company has said it plans additional roll - outs			1
entrepreneur @entity71 stands in her workspace at @entity118 for hackers collaboration in @entity5 , @entity6			1
@entity71 moved to @entity6 from @entity92 as her business plan is dependent on a fast internet connection many in the tech industry believe @entity15 's move could ultimately force broadband providers to accelerate their networks to compete			1
making internet access faster would give the company more opportunities to attract traffic and sell more advertising - the main way @entity15 makes money			1
the ' @entity134 ' and its unique business pitch is the brainchild of local web developer @entity137 , whose property was among the first wave of houses to be fiber - wired and is a block away from the @entity24 offices			1
' hackers ' who pass @entity137 's application process and show a real intention to work on a viable project can live there rent - free for three months			0
hotspot : @entity5 technology companies , like those at the @entity37 , are flourishing since starting the home in october after cashing in his @entity152 and putting a down payment on the $ 48,000 home , @entity137 has gotten applications from nearly 60 people seeking a spot in the home			2
' the whole startup thing in @entity5 is like this huge growing beast , ' he said			2
' it 's got this crazy momentum			0
' the house has been full since mid-december with @entity71 and two others			0
one of the rooms also is reserved for fiber tourists who want a place for a day or two where they can download anything faster than they could elsewhere			2
' the hope is that these startups will move their operations to @entity5 and this will really bless @entity5 , bring jobs and taxes and we 'll build a really cool tech scene , ' @entity137 said			1
@entity36 works at his desk in the basement of @entity5 @entity37			2
@entity181 now houses several startup companies a few homes away from the ' @entity134 ' is the headquarters of the @entity5 @entity37 , which was started by local entrepreneur @entity36 and where @entity185 , founder of mobile search app @entity187 , has his offices			2
@entity189 said @entity24 brought attention to @entity5 's startup culture , ' because it sort of ignites the imagination about what you can do with that sort of bandwidth capability			0
' ' most every week i meet one or two or three people that are looking to come in from out of town , ' he said			0
despite the growth , it remains a challenge for startups to raise money from @entity5 , @entity189 said			1
@entity68 venture capital groups in particular want startup entrepreneurs to be nearby in @entity44 , he said			0
' i 've had some really incredible conversations with some big name vcs , and their first statement is that when you 're in this early stage you have to be here , right next to us , ' he said			0
' that is a hurdle			0
' @entity216 recently launched @entity217 , an online forms management site , and also has offices near the ' home for hackers			0
' he said @entity5 has no aspirations to be the next @entity68 and may never have a ' @entity224 or a giant consumer - level company that takes over the world			2
' he said it may also be ' better for us ' that it 's more difficult to raise money in @entity5			0
' the hardest thing about a startup is execution , ok ? a lot of people can go out and raise money and get money for an idea or for some product or they can come up with some awesome presentation			0
but it does n't matter if you ca n't build something that people will use , ' @entity216 said			0
' i think here in @entity5 you have to at some point put your money where your mouth is			0
you have to " do			0
" ' @entity61 shows a room set aside for ' fiber tourists ' at @entity118 for hackers			0

@entity15 tests its new fiber - optic network , much faster than cable modems , in @entity5
*impressive* internet speeds have attracted startups and encouraged tech collaboration in the area
