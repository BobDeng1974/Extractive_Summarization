the search for alien life has so far focused on planets that are similar to @entity3			1
but astronomers may have missed a trick by looking too closely at worlds that are like our own , according to a new report			0
the study suggests there may be planets that do not necessarily look like @entity3 , but that could have environments more favourable to supporting life			1
given these characteristics , @entity19 , a member of the closest stellar system to the sun , is an ideal target for searches of a superhabitable world ‘ in my point of view , astronomers and biologists are biased , ’ @entity27 , an astrophysicist at @entity29 's @entity28 who is the study 's lead author , told @entity31			0
scientists believe ' superhabitable ' planets would most likely be two to three times bigger than @entity3 and much older			1
they believe any liquid would be found over the surface of the planet in shallow reservoirs rather than in giant , deep oceans			1
like @entity3 , the planets would have a magnetic field to shield them from space weather			1
however , scientists predict that the planets would have much thicker atmospheres			2
in the study ‘ @entity52 ’ , professor @entity27 proposes that tidal heating can create conditions where life could emerge on an icy or terrestrial planet once thought to be uninhabitable			1
tidal heating is the frictional heating of a satellite 's core caused by the gravitational pull of its parent planet and possibly neighbouring satellites			1
these planets would most likely be two to three times bigger than @entity3 and much older , the researchers say			1
they believe any liquid would be found over the surface of the planet in shallow reservoirs rather than in giant , deep oceans			1
given these characteristics , they claim @entity19 , a member of the closest stellar system to the sun , is an ideal target for searches of a superhabitable world			0
' from a potpourri of habitable worlds that may exist , @entity3 might well turn out as one that is marginally habitable , even bizarre from a biocentric standpoint , ' the researchers write			2
in the study ' @entity52 ' , professor @entity27 proposes that tidal heating can create conditions where life could emerge on an icy or terrestrial planet once thought to be uninhabitable			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of an exoplanet the @entity96 is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet 's surface			2
to determine the location of a star 's habitable zone , scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits			0
knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry			0
for example , molecules in a planet 's atmosphere will absorb a certain amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out			0
how much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes			0
like @entity3 , the planets would have a magnetic field to shield them from space weather			1
however , scientists predict that the planets would have much thicker atmospheres			2
‘ a tidally heated planet would be unpleasant though spectacular to visit , ’ said @entity132 , senior editor for @entity134 and @entity27 in the @entity135 at @entity136			0
current studies suggest that super-earths are more common than @entity3 - size planets so far , scientists have detected about a thousand planets orbiting other stars in something known as the @entity96			2
the @entity96 is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet 's surface			2
this has started a race to find the one that most resembles @entity3			0
but in a separate study , @entity157 researchers suggested that @entity3 - sized planets can support life at least ten times further away from stars than previously thought			1
this means that cold rocky planets previously considered uninhabitable may be teeming with life beneath the surface			2
academics at the @entity167 and @entity168 believe the definition of the ‘ @entity171 ’ zone is flawed			0
they argue this definition fails to take into account life that can exist beneath a planet ’s surface			0
so far , scientists have detected about a thousand planets orbiting other stars in something known as the @entity96			0
this is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet 's surface			0

these planets would likely be three times larger than @entity3 and much older
study says liquid would be found in shallow reservoirs rather than oceans
the planets would have a magnetic field to shield them from space weather
scientists also believe tidal heating could create conditions where life would emerge on an icy planet once thought to be uninhabitable
