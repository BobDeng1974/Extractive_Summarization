it seems that no showbiz party is complete without an appearance from former @entity3 turned tv presenter @entity4			1
yet the ex-wife of former @entity7 defender @entity6 may be forced to end her champagne lifestyle – because she has been diagnosed with the pre-cancerous throat condition @entity10			1
the cause of the disease is thought to be long - term acid reflux , or heartburn – and alcohol consumption is thought to exacerbate the problem			1
@entity4 , the ex-wife of former @entity7 defender @entity6 , has been diagnosed with the pre-cancerous throat condition @entity19 ’s oesophagus @entity4 first sought medical advice after she ‘ woke up in agony in the night with terrible chest pains , after months of not feeling well ’ , she recalls			1
the condition , in which the cells lining the oesophagus become abnormal due to constant reflux , is thought to affect about two in every 100 @entity27			1
the divorced 46 - year - old mother of two , who is currently filming her new @entity28 tv show @entity28 , continues : ‘ it ’s very scary because i understand it can develop into throat cancer			1
’ @entity4 says she is on a cocktail of drugs to control the problem			1
aspirin could be an effective treatment for schizophrenia – helping the thousands of sufferers who do not respond to the usual first - line treatment of anti-psychotic medication			2
the condition affects about one person in 100 , causing severe delusions and hallucinations			1
anti-psychotics – which correct levels of the brain chemical dopamine , thought to be involved in driving the condition – do n’t work for everyone , with up to 30 per cent of patients not responding at all			1
now researchers at the @entity52 at @entity54 ’s medical centre have found that combining anti-psychotics with the common painkiller improves recovery			1
aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug as well as a painkiller and blood - thinner			2
although the exact reason that it boosts the effectiveness of anti-psychotics is unknown , one theory is that it has an effect on the immune system , which may be a factor in the disease			2
' hospitals need sound of music ' the sister of philosopher @entity72 is urging the @entity73 to provide ‘ healing music ’ to patients			2

’ @entity82 , the hospitals arts and enterprising health manager , agreed , saying : ‘ research projects we are running are providing evidence of the profound psychological and physiological benefits that music can bring			2
’ @entity76 , a former clinical psychologist who recently performed a special concert at @entity7 and @entity78 , @entity79 , said : ‘ the hospital has a fantastic healing arts programme ’ dogs aid a good night 's sleep sharing a bed with your dog may improve your sleep			1
more than seven out of ten people share a bed or room with their dogs , and many say it helps them to nod off , and sleep more soundly			2
a study at the @entity106 carried out an internet - based survey where they quizzed pet owners about their sleeping arrangements			0
the online survey included 22 questions about various aspects related to sleep habits and sleep quality , and pets			0
about 90 per cent of the 630 people who took part were women , with an average age of 38 , and 43 per cent owned more than one dog			0
seventy - eight per cent said they regularly slept with the dogs in the same bed or room			0
‘ the overwhelming majority believed their sleep quality to be positively influenced by the dog , ’ say the researchers			0
‘ they also rated their sleep as sounder and deeper and fell asleep more easily			0
’ some research has shown that the companionship of owning a dog in the @entity27 can lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels , and improve mood			0
however , the research suggests that getting too close to man ’s best friend can also have ill effects			2
the study concluded that bed - sharing with domestic pets could lead to the spread of infections			0
‘ although uncommon with healthy pets , the risk for transmission through bed - sharing , kissing and licking , is real , ’ the report says			0
in need of a pick - me - up to improve your performance at the gym ? a new beetroot - based sports bar could be the answer			0
