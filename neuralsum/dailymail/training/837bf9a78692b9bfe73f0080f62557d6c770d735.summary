babies can be exposed to high levels of chemical emission from mattresses as they sleep , a new study has found			1
researchers tested the the foam padding in crib mattresses , and found they release significant amounts of volatile organic compounds ( @entity10 ) , potentially harmful chemicals also found in household items such as cleaners and scented sprays			1
today they warned parents to air mattresses properly to minimise the risk			1
the researchers say that mattresses release potentially harmful chemicals when a baby 's body heat warms them			1
findings suggest reuse of an older crib or an extended airing - out period may help reduce infant voc exposures			0
however , the team say reuse of crib mattress must be considered carefully because older mattresses might contain toxic substances , such as flame retardants , that have been banned			1
the researchers studied samples of polyurethane foam and polyester foam padding from 20 new and old crib mattresses for the study in the february issue of @entity39			2
the 20 mattress samples are from 10 manufacturers			0
the researchers chose not to disclose the names of the manufacturers studied so that their results could draw general attention to the product segment without focusing on specific brands			0
@entity49 decided to conduct the study after finding out that infants spend 50 to 60 percent of their day sleeping			0
infants are considered highly susceptible to the adverse health effects of exposure to indoor air pollutants			2
' i wanted to know more about the chemicals they may inhale as they sleep during their early stages of development , ' said , who led the study			0
' this research also helps to raise awareness about the various chemicals that may be found in crib mattresses , which are not typically listed by manufacturers			1
' new crib mattresses release about four times as many @entity10 as old crib mattresses , the team found , and body heat increases emissions			1
chemical emissions are strongest in the sleeping infant ’s immediate breathing zone , they said			0
the researchers identified more than 30 vocs in the mattresses , including phenol , neodecanoic acid and linalool			2
at present , not much is known about the health effects that occur from the levels of @entity10 found in homes , according to the @entity87 @entity86			1
among the many chemicals considered vocs are formaldehyde , benzene , toluene , perchlorethylene and acetone			0
the crib mattresses analyzed in this study did not contain those organic compounds			1
the researchers concluded that , on average , mattresses emitted vocs at a rate of 87.1 micrograms per square meter per hour , while older mattresses emitted vocs at a rate of 22.1 micrograms per square meter per hour			2
overall , @entity49 said crib mattresses release @entity10 at rates comparable to other consumer products and indoor materials , including laminate flooring ( 20 to 35 micrograms per square meter per hour ) and wall covering ( 51 micrograms per square meter per hour )			1
the researchers identified more than 30 vocs in the mattresses , including phenol , neodecanoic acid and linalool			2
the most abundant chemicals identified in the crib mattress foam , such as limonene ( a chemical that gives products a lemon scent ) , are routinely found in many cleaning and consumer products			2
chemist and indoor air quality expert @entity124 , adjunct professor in environmental and occupational medicine at @entity127 , said he does not think the levels of chemical concentration found in the mattresses are alarming , but he considers the research valuable			1
' it ’s good to be alerted to the fact that crib mattresses are a significant source of chemicals in an infant ’s environment , ' said @entity124 , who noted crib mattresses might one day be analyzed for noxious chemicals as a result of such research			1
the researchers found that voc levels were significantly higher in a sleeping infant ’s breathing zone when compared with bulk room air , exposing infants to about twice the voc levels as people standing in the same room			2
additionally , because infants inhale significantly higher air volume per body weight than adults and sleep a longer time , they experience about 10 times as much inhalation exposure as adults when exposed to the same level of @entity10 , the researchers said			1
' our findings suggest the reuse of an older crib or an extended airing - out period may help reduce infant voc exposures , ' said assistant professor @entity167 used mattresses may appear to be a good alternative , the researchers noted that older mattresses might contain other harmful chemicals such as flame retardants now banned in mattress foams			0
graduate student @entity49 , in the @entity175 ’s @entity174 , conducted the study under the supervision of assistant professor @entity178 and associate professor @entity179			0
@entity49 also worked with senior researcher @entity180 from the @entity181			0

“ we need to better understand the complex sleep microenvironment to improve it and reduce the harmful effects of related pollutants on infants , ” @entity210 and the @entity212 program funded the project			0
@entity49 conducted the research in @entity218 , where he currently @entity219 is committed to transparency and disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest			0
all @entity225 investigators involved with this research have filed their required financial disclosure forms with the university			0

team found that the mattresses release significant amounts of volatile organic compounds ( @entity10 )
parents warned to air mattresses properly
newer mattresses most at risk
