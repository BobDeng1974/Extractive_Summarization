a woman who did n't even know she was pregnant until her third trimester gave birth to a 14 - pound baby boy on january 29			1
@entity6 's @entity5 's baby @entity4 is the largest baby to ever be born at @entity8 ’s @entity7 in @entity9 and is one of the largest babies ever to be born in @entity12			1
@entity13 reports that @entity14 was putting on the pounds last fall and went to the doctor because she thought she may have some kind of medical issue			0
big welcome : @entity14 gave birth to @entity4 weighing 14 - lb , the heaviest baby born at @entity21 in @entity22 had no idea she was pregnant : @entity14 went to the doctor during her third trimester because she was putting on a lot of weight and doctors told her she was 35 weeks pregnant baby fat : the average weight of a baby is 7 pounds 7.5 ounces which is half the size of 14lb baby @entity4 the doctor told her she was 35 weeks pregnant and that she had just a few weeks to prepare for her new family member			1
@entity5 grew quite large during her pregnancy and thought she may be carrying twins because she was a twin herself			0
when @entity38 gave birth naturally to her 14.1 pound baby boy she realized she did not have twins just an abnormally large baby the size of two average babies			1
@entity5 also has a one - year - old son and 5 - year - old daughter at home			0
most large babies are delivered by cesarean section in the @entity50 because large babies can cause complications during childbirth for both the baby and the mother			1
pediatrics expert dr. @entity56 told the @entity57 that the average weight of a baby is 7 pounds 7.5 ounces			0
big surprise : @entity14 thought she might be giving birth to twins because she put on so much weight during her pregnancy but she naturally gave birth to just one huge 14lb baby boy hungry ? : @entity4 is an abnormally large baby and while he is healthy , his mother will need to monitor his diet to prevent him from becoming obese later in life big plan : @entity14 thought she was merely gaining lots of weight but when a doctor told her she was pregnant she welcomed her new baby boy with loving arms babies that weigh over 8 pounds and 8 ounces are considered to be on the heavier end of the spectrum			1
14 pounds is certainly a lot of weight for a baby , but nothing tops the @entity83 's biggest birth of 22 pounds 8 oz. in @entity84			2
@entity85 gave birth to the large child with @entity88 , a disease that causes excessive growth in children due to genetic abnormalities			2
@entity93 reports that having an abnormally large baby may be linked to a mother 's high blood sugar if not a genetic disorder			0
around 1 in 10 women in the @entity50 will have a baby that weighs more than 9 pounds			0
@entity4 is currently healthy but his mother will have to monitor his diet if she does n't want to risk the child becoming obese later in life			0
new family member : in addition to newborn baby @entity38 has a one - year - old son and 5 - year - old daughter at home hey baby : @entity4 is a welcome addition to the @entity5 family where he is considered the biggest , smallest member			2

@entity6 's @entity5 's 14 - lb baby @entity4 is the largest baby to ever be born at @entity8 ’s @entity7 in @entity9
@entity14 went to the doctor because she was gaining weight and realized that she was 35 weeks pregnant
