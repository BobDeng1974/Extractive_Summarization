by @entity0 published : 12:05 est , 4 january 2014 updated : 12:06 est , 4 january 2014 senator @entity2 is spearheading a class action lawsuit against the government over @entity7 spy programs			2
the lawsuit ’s announcement comes only hours after the secret @entity11 court renewed the government ’s permission friday to collect bulk telephone metadata			1
mr @entity2 claimed that several hundred thousand people have already signed up for the suit that he hopes will be reviewed by the @entity18 @entity17 – perhaps an inevitability after courts have issued differing @entity22 rulings on the constitutionality of the program			1
announcing the suit : senator @entity2 ( @entity3 ) spoke about the lawsuit in a friday night appearance on @entity28 the senator contended told @entity28 that to applying a single warrant to millions of people is unconstitutional and that questions of constitutionality should not be decided by the secretive @entity11 court			1
‘ the question here is whether or not you can have a single warrant applied to millions of people , ’ mr @entity2 said before explaining that anyone with a cell phone is eligible to sign up			0
‘ no you ca n’t have our records without our permission or without a warrant specific to an individual			0
’ the government quietly announced in a friday afternoon statement from director of national intelligence @entity49 ’s office that the surveillance program has been renewed			1
the statement also included defense of the spy program ’s legality , perhaps in an attempt to head mr @entity2 ’s lawsuit off at the pass			2
suing the @entity7 : senator @entity2 's facebook page touts the lawsuit , which he says hundreds of thousands of people have joined citing the rulings of judges in @entity65 in the @entity66 of both @entity67 and @entity68 , as well as 16 @entity11 court judges on 36 occasions , the government claimed the program is lawful			1
mr @entity2 disagreed , saying that @entity18 should not have to trade their @entity73 rights for protections against terrorism			2
‘ we think we can have security that we can defend against terrorism , but that does n’t mean that every individual @entity18 has to give up their privacy , ’ he said			0
mr @entity2 may have a case after @entity18 district court judge @entity83 ruled last month in @entity84 , that the program was unconstitutional , and ordered the removal of the records of two individuals			1
' i am not convinced at this point in the litigation that the @entity7 ’s database has ever truly served the purpose of rapidly identifying terrorists in time - sensitive investigations , ' judge @entity83 wrote in his ruling , according to @entity97			0
anyone with a cell phone : mr @entity2 says anyone with a cell phone is eligible to join the lawsuit the government surveillance program collects telephone metadata – who calls , when they call and for how long			1
contents of conversations are not recorded , the government has repeatedly claimed			0
former virginia attorney general @entity109 is the lead counsel for the class action lawsuit , mr @entity2 said			2
he previously sued the feds over the constitutionality of @entity113			0
outrage at the @entity7 and other agencies has reached a fever pitch in the last six months after former government contractor @entity117 fled the country with a series of documents detailing how the @entity18 government spies both domestically and abroad			0
the announcement the @entity11 court approved the hearing was notably made public without any further details – it is not known what the actual ruling stipulated .			0

@entity2 ( @entity3 ) announced the lawsuit just hours after the secret @entity11 court renewed the government surveillance program
*conflicting* court rulings over the past month over the collection of telephone metadata may pave the way for the lawsuit to be argued in the @entity18 @entity17
hundreds of thousands have joined the lawsuit , mr @entity2 claimed
