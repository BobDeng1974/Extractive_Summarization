even when goal - line technology and an inspired goalkeeper were working in their favour , @entity0 just could not quite get a break			1
did they deserve one ? almost certainly not on the balance of a game where one side had noticeably higher ambitions than the other			0
did @entity10 deserve more ? definitely			1
he was simply magnificent , a barrier that @entity12 could not knock down for 78 minutes			1
and then , just like that , it was seven away defeats from seven trips			0

manager : @entity49 @entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity10 8.5 ; @entity23 5.5 , @entity50 6 , @entity51 6 , @entity52 6 ; @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 6 , @entity55 6.5 ( @entity56 80 ) , @entity57 6 ; @entity58 5.5 ; @entity59 6			1

booked : @entity55 , @entity67 @entity68 referee : @entity70 7 @entity71 : @entity10 att : 20,145 @entity18 broke the heart , going outside @entity23 and firing in off the post , and @entity37 kicked dirt in their eyes with a low finish from the edge of the area five minutes later			1
it was cruel on only one man - a goalkeeper with a green shirt and a red face			2
but @entity68 could hardly argue as he weighed up the worst possible yield from a run of away games against top - half opposition			2
‘ we have had hard games , ’ he said			0
‘ we caught @entity90 on the back of their five - game winning run , and we went to @entity95 and @entity96 and @entity97			2
‘ they have not been easy			0
you only have to look at the table – the teams that have come up have ( to make ) a big step up			0
’ predictably , @entity49 carried a happier disposition			0
he said : ‘ some of @entity10 ’s saves were fantastic			2
he probably did n’t deserve to be on the losing side			0
‘ but for me that was our most complete performance			0
’ @entity10 ’s impact on that performance was felt almost immediately			2
he smothered @entity37 after the winger was clean through after three minutes and then blocked @entity32 ’s header moments later			1
when @entity38 had a shot deflected off @entity55 , it was @entity10 who scrambled across his line to keep it out			2
when @entity38 had a free - kick on the edge of the box towards the end of the period , it was @entity10 who acrobatically kept the sheet clean , albeit with the help of goal - line technology			1
the ball was almost entirely over the line			0
@entity0 keeper @entity10 makes a finger tip save from @entity38 in a sensational performance goal line technology judged in @entity0 's favour during a frustrating match for the @entity133 before they broke through @entity10 makes another diving save while the @entity137 's most lethal striker - @entity135 - lurks in the penalty area @entity139 was a serious source of frustration for the home side with saves like this a common sight at the @entity146 for @entity12 , it was looking like deja vu after battering @entity149 on saturday and only taking a point			1
@entity49 said : ‘ the message at half time was to keep moving the ball quickly and if we continue to create hopefully we will take one or two			2
thankfully we were able to do that			0
’ for 78 minutes here , including two fine second - half saves by @entity10 to deny @entity135 , there was no breaking through			1
it was no less than each side deserved , barring one man			0
@entity12 keeper @entity30 is well - positioned to save a @entity67 ( not pictured ) header late in the first half the loss to @entity12 puts @entity0 just one point ahead of @entity166 ( above ) on the bottom of the @entity137			1
meanwhile , @entity168 's @entity12 ( right ) move one spot off next season 's @entity169 and ahead of @entity171 , who play on wednesday			1
@entity0 's @entity23 attempts to hold off @entity135 at the @entity146 @entity38 ( left ) is challenged by @entity0 's @entity53 during a tight first half tussle @entity37 's strike five minutes after the opener beat unlucky @entity10 for a second time not even on fire @entity10 , in his customary all green kit , could save @entity37 's effort to his right @entity37 celebrates his goal with @entity41 after @entity12 's persistent pressure finally broke @entity0 @entity68 gestures to his players as @entity0 record their seventh loss in seven away fixtures so far in the @entity137			1

@entity18 opened the scoring in the 78th minute before @entity37 made it 2 - 0 five minutes later
@entity10 was sensational in goal for @entity0 until he was beaten twice in the second half
@entity0 have now lost all seven of their home matches this season and are only ahead of @entity166
@entity12 are now one place off @entity199 *qualification* , two points behind @entity201
