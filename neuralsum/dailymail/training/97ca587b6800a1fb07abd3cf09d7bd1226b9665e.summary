at one point @entity48 said she confided in @entity38 , saying : ‘ i ca n’t take this any more			2

‘ he said to me that if i did n’t go back to him and clear his name he would destroy me – and also started spreading false allegations of drug use , and in particular that awful incident at @entity85			1
‘ i feel his way of getting this out was to use this case			0
’ she added : ‘ drug allegations came out in september which indirectly mr @entity3 had menaced me with in august , and i just said , “ what drug allegations ? there are n’t going to be any ”			1

i ’m afraid that is how it is now			0
he feels betrayed by me			0
’ miss @entity4 said : ‘ that marriage was very difficult in very many stages			2
