what their demure expressions fail to reveal , however , is that they are all posing for their police mugshot			1
although each is an offender apprehended in @entity11 in the 1870s , in only a couple of photos is it possible to detect any inkling of remorse			1
instead , their bewildered faces reflect a time when photography was a relatively new technology and posing for a picture a rarity			0
jailed : labourer @entity25 ( left ) , 43 , from @entity26 , @entity27 , served a one - month sentence after he was convicted of stealing four rabbits , while blacksmith @entity30 ( right ) , 32 , was sent to @entity31 for stealing beef criminal records : @entity34 ( left ) , 21 , was sentenced to four months in @entity31 for stealing pigeons			2

she was sentenced to six months in @entity31 following this mugshot the fascinating images , which mostly feature petty thieves who stole everything from rabbits to champagne , have been released today by @entity52			1
the criminality detailed in the charges may be the same as in contemporary @entity56 , but the mixture of scruffy clothing and more formal @entity2 street attire worn in the mugshots clearly defines an era of mass poverty			2
shipbuilding and heavy engineering were @entity11 ’s main industries in the 19th century and the city was a powerhouse of the @entity67			1
but while the latter had made @entity56 rich , it also led to grinding poverty in cramped inner - city slums plagued by hunger and disease			0
@entity74 , @entity75 at @entity52 , said : ‘ @entity11 expanded enormously from the 1850s onwards and as the population increased , living conditions for most were poor			1
' it was a boom town with people coming in from the countryside , @entity82 and @entity83 looking for work , but there were n’t always enough jobs to go around			0
' caught : @entity87 ( left ) , was a 64 - year - old tailor from @entity88 who was sentenced to 14 days of hard labour for stealing clothes in 1873			0

ms @entity74 said : ‘ it was mostly opportunism with metal hanging around , but obviously it had a resale value			0
there ’s still a lot of metal theft going on around here today			0
’ the widespread poverty led to parents educating their children in the skills of street survival , condemning a further generation to a life of crime			0
@entity129 , historian and author of @entity131 , turned up police records which show that in the years from 1838 to 1851 the number of minors arrested for petty crimes more than doubled			1
some of the children picked up by the police were as young as eight , and they were often held in stinking prison cells alongside adults			2
these pictures of adult offenders , as well as those of their juvenile counterparts , make up just some of @entity52 ’ collection , which are being put online			1
