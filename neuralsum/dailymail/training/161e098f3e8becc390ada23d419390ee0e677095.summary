by @entity0 published : 22:08 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 01:56 est , 18 april 2012 an amateur footballer who almost blinded a referee by kicking him in the face for sending him off has been spared jail			1
@entity5 was sent off by match official @entity6 for swearing and aggressive behaviour during a sunday league match in @entity10			1
but as @entity5 left the field having been sent off , he ran back towards the 19 - year - old referee and launched a flying kick at him as @entity6 recorded the sending - off in his notebook			1
cowardly : amateur referee @entity6 thought he had been blinded after the thuggish attack which left him needing six stitches above his right eye @entity5 , 22 , jumped at @entity6 with both feet and kicked him in the face with his left boot			1
the official only realised what had happened when he woke up in an ambulance , and needed six stitches to a large wound above his right eye			1
the court was told mr @entity6 feared he had lost vision in his right eye and had been left with a permanent scar			2
but the violent sunday league player was spared a prison term after a judge ruled his attack did not pass the custody threshold ' by a whisker '			0
@entity5 , who pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm , said he had been ‘ infuriated ’ by the referee who he thought had been ‘ winding him up ’ during the match at @entity39 playing fields , @entity41 , last october			1
he was told by the judge , recorder @entity42 : ' it does n’t need me to emphasise to anyone reading a paper , or seeing a photograph of this injury , that it was extremely unpleasant indeed			0
' you risked causing permanent damage to this man ’s eyesight			0
it appears that you regarded the referee with less than favour for some time , and used foul language to an official merely trying to do his job			0
' thug : @entity5 , 22 ( left ) had already been sent off for aggressive behaviour when he assaulted the match official , leaving him with a permanent scar the judge said although the offence crossed the custody threshold , he felt able - ‘ by a whisker ’ - to suspend a 10 - month jail sentence for two years			1
the court heard that @entity5 , of @entity70 , @entity71 , became increasingly agitated as his @entity73 side fell 2 - 0 behind to @entity74 - and had a penalty awarded against them			2
mr @entity6 , a @entity77 student , told police the attack was ‘ cowardly ’ and said it would affect him for life			2
he said : ' i was unconscious for a while			0
there was blood everywhere and i thought i had been blinded , as i could not see through one eye			2
' @entity87 , defending , said @entity5 , who has been banned by the league , had acted on the spur of the moment , never been in trouble before and had expressed genuine remorse			0
@entity93 will be subject to supervision by the @entity95 for 12 months			0
he was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work in the community and to pay his victim £ 750 compensation .			0
