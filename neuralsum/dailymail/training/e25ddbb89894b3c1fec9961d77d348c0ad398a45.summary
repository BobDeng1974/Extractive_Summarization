spooked : was this apparition the @entity1 of @entity2 , or a trick of the light ? whenever i mention to people that i have seen ghosts , i can depend on one of two opposite reactions			1
some people will be fascinated and want to know more			1
others will vehemently pooh - pooh the possibility of ghosts - either i ’m deluded or i ’m lying			1
there can be no such thing as ghosts ! the vehemence , even violence , with which sceptics deny their existence makes me suspicious			1
what are they afraid of ? that there are more things in heaven and earth than science can account for ? @entity26 is a thrilling place for those who do believe in ghosts			1
it is the most haunted country there is - with 10,000 places which are famed for sightings			1
one is the @entity34 ’s @entity2 which appeared in the news pages last week after a tourist took an accidental photograph which appeared to show the castle ’s ‘ @entity1 ’ in an ancient archway			1
only on digital magnification did the image become visible			1
it looks like the grey ghost of a woman of the tudor period or earlier			1
but , of course , ‘ ghost ’ photographs can always be the result of a trick of the light , not to mention our tendency to make images out of any shapes that we see			1
it is actually very rare to see ghosts ; it ’s much more common to hear them			1
i ’ve experienced both and it has made me sure that there is something ‘ out there ’			1
your hair stands on end			1
worms crawl up your spine			1
your neck feels as though it is being clenched in an unseen grip			1
it first happened to me at boarding school at @entity76 , which is housed in the magnificent @entity78 mansion built by the family which became @entity81			1
one brilliant summer ’s night i went for a walk under the full moon and was coming back up a grassy rise when i saw two figures , a man and a woman , walking towards the massive flight of steps up to the portico of the school with its @entity94 columns			1
everyone was in bed ( bar myself ) , and these people had nothing to do with the school			1
who were they ? i hastened to confront them , but by the time i reached the building they had turned up the steps and mounted them close together as if in conversation			1
before i could catch up , very out of breath , they had disappeared over the top step into the dark shadows of the portico			1
the big doors had not opened or light would have spilled out			1
and the sheer drop from the side would put off anyone from jumping			1
that was when i froze with the reactions i have described above			1
i was stunned by two things			1
first , their antique clothing — long skirts on the woman , an oddly long - hanging jacket on the man and weird hats			1
then there was the fact that they had made no noise , no footsteps on the stairs , no murmur of voices			2
and they never once looked round at me			2
i had been watching a pair of ghosts from another century			1
after investigating costume history , i came to the conclusion that their dress was most like the @entity153 , and that therefore they could have been the second @entity155 and his @entity155 , who inherited @entity76 in that period			2
they had strolled up the steps as if they owned it			2
i said nothing about my ghost sighting at the time for fear of being laughed at			2
then , 60 years later , to my great surprise , i found a description of an uncannily similar couple walking along the ridge , mounting the steps and vanishing among the columns of the portico			2
it was in an anniversary issue of the school magazine			2
the account was dated ten years earlier than my experience			2
so i was not alone			2
i could believe my eyes with more confidence			2
spooky : @entity181 saw ghostly figures on the steps of his school , @entity185 in @entity186 ( pictured ) the next ghost i encountered was when i worked in @entity188			1
as a night - time newspaper sub-editor , i used to take a supper break in a pub around 10pm			2
coming back from @entity193 near the river one night , a female colleague and i were late			2
a short - cut then existed , a narrow footpath between silent black buildings which was called @entity199			2
it was swept away during later redevelopment , though the street sign is still there			2
it was a murky , ill - lit passage , but we were in a rush so began to climb it			2
you could see the uphill pavement was empty all the way			2
halfway along , as we reached the crossing with another passage , there was a street light , the only one			2
as we passed across , we both suddenly stopped — and froze			2
slowly both of us looked back the way we had come			0
perched on a step to a building doorway was a large sack which we had not noticed on the way past			0
from the neck of the sack protruded a large human hand			1
with every nerve in my spine on edge , i gingerly approached it			0
it was not a glove			0
i could see the knuckles and veins , even the texture of the skin with uncanny clarity in the light of the street lamp			0
i bent closer but — i do n’t know why — could n’t bring myself to touch it			0
the sack was more than waist - high and it could well have contained the rest of a body			0
‘ it ’s a hand , ’ i said , unnecessarily , for she could see it as well as i. we hastened back up to @entity188			1
we agreed that i ought to phone the police , but i thought i ’d better go back and check first			0
i wanted to make sure what it was			0
i returned down @entity199 and reached the crossing with the street light			0
nothing there , no sack , no hand , even the building entrance looked different from the one i ’d seen only two or three minutes previously			1
where could it have gone ? the doorway looked firmly locked and unused for years			0
there were no other hiding places			0
could someone have come to collect the sack and vanished ? in that short time , it seemed impossible			0
anyway , what were the contents intended for ? i did not phone the police but i watched the newspapers in vain for stories of a body being found round there for the next week or two			0
in darkness : the author saw a withered hand in an alleyway off @entity188 ( pictured ) during a late night shift of course , my colleague and i discussed it in every detail — and in every detail we agreed on what we had seen			1
particularly the unearthly clarity of the vision and the very disturbing feeling it gave us both			0
there were two of us sharing one experience			0
it could not be dismissed as imaginary			0
i wondered if we had time - travelled into a previous century for those few moments			0
or else the sack had done so into ours			0
forty years later , i found confirmation of this theory when i was telling a friend the story			0
‘ @entity306 ? ’ she exclaimed			0
‘ but that ’s in @entity308 ! ’ indeed , it appears in @entity310 , set in 1775			0
in @entity199 lodged @entity311 , doorman of a @entity188 bank with a night - time hobby — body - snatching			1
enduring appeal : tv shows such as @entity317 ( pictured ) flourish with large audiences he and his gang called it ‘ fishing ’ — slinking into cemeteries to exhume recently buried bodies			0
there was a brisk demand for corpses for dissection at the city ’s medical schools			0
an intact cadaver would fetch 20 guineas			0
and the centre of the trade operated in @entity335			0
the records of @entity338 trials bear this out , and it ’s why @entity308 lodged his unsavoury mr @entity311 there			0
so i believe in ghosts			1
i believe there are places where some kind of memory persists which can be activated by the psychic energy of suitable people			0
i suppose i am one of them - though not a remarkable example - not only because i have seen three ghosts , but because i have heard many more			1
i have lived in three old houses , disturbed regularly by loud footsteps crunching heavily upstairs , knockings and dragging noises , the swish of long skirts and some sudden , strange smells of something metallic			0
i ’ve stayed in several old country houses and hotels where i have been woken in the night by a tremendous knocking on the door or a pandemonium of voices in the next room			0
next morning i would tell reception and get such a reply as : ‘ no , there was no one in the room next to yours last night			0
’ scoff as you may , there is more interest nowadays in ghost - hunting and in psychic phenomena than at any time since the @entity376			0
ghost - hunting weekends at old sites are very popular and tv shows such as ‘ @entity317 ’ flourish			0
i welcome this because i am convinced there are further powers hidden in nature , especially in the human consciousness , to be discovered			0
there are far too many experiences of haunting and inexplicable presences or disturbances of normality , which have been recorded throughout the centuries , for anyone to dismiss them as mere superstition or fraud .			0
