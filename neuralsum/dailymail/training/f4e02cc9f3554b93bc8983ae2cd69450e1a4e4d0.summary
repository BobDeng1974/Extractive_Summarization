by @entity0 snapping her fingers and swinging her arms as she walked down the fairway , @entity1 completed a runaway victory in the sectional qualifier for the @entity7 at @entity8 in her native @entity9 on monday			1
bearing in mind 1,622 women representing 46 @entity13 states and 51 other countries entered this tortuous qualifying process for the chance to play at @entity17 next month , to win her own particular 36 - hole marathon by seven shots was some achievement			1
but here ’s the extraordinary thing : @entity1 is aged just 11			1
history : eleven - year - old @entity1 has become the youngest player to qualify for the @entity7 watching brief : @entity1 impressed at the @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 at august in april and so if it was n’t enough that she got to putt on the 18th green at @entity31 in april as the runaway winner in her age division in the club ’s first drive , @entity36 and @entity37 for juniors — heck , what chance did anyone else stand ? — now she gets to play in a full - blown major , as the youngest - ever qualifier			1
@entity1 got into golf only four years ago , and then it was by chance			1
she was bored waiting for her brother and cousin , who were playing in a tournament , so she hit a few balls on the driving range			0
it was n’t long before she became a student at the @entity53 golf school in @entity54			0
five months after picking up her first club , she was finishing third in her first tournament			0
no category has been helped by technology quite as much as young females			0
the clubs are so light these days they are compensating for a natural lack of strength , and it allows someone like @entity1 to cultivate a fabulous - looking golf swing with sumptuous balance and grace even at her tender age			1
last sunday , the amazing new zealander @entity70 , just 17 and the world no 3 already , had the chance to reach the summit before fading a little on the last day of the @entity73 in @entity74			0
it ’s only a matter of time , of course , before she reaches the top			0
she might even do it before her 18th birthday			0
child prodigy : @entity1 putting on the 10th hole at the 2013 @entity13 women 's public links golf event in @entity84 the youngest females to play in the @entity7 before @entity1 were @entity13 @entity86 and @entity87 , who were 12			1
the obvious danger is that such bright lights will be extinguished by the time their teenage years are over , but @entity86 , 25 , and @entity87 , 19 , have both avoided burn - out to become major champions in their own right			1
indeed , on the day @entity1 was winning at @entity31 , @entity87 was putting the finishing touches to her maiden major triumph			1
working with noted coach @entity53 has allowed @entity1 to meet some of the world ’s best already , including @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity87			1
it ’s the mop - haired ulsterman who ’s her idol , however			2
‘ @entity102 is so nice , isn ’ t he ? ’ she coos			0
to think , it was n’t that long ago that @entity105 was the fresh - faced kid looking up at his heroes			2
now , at the ripe age of 25 , the generation he ’s inspiring are already making waves			0
so many , like @entity110 , @entity1 and @entity111 , have @entity113 heritage			2
indeed , the greatest boon in the history of golf was not inspired by @entity117 winning the masters aged 21 but the @entity119 winning the @entity7 in 1998			1
it provoked phenomenal interest in the @entity122 , which manifests itself today in the great number of talented @entity113 golfers who are making such an impression on the world game			0
the greatest performance by a girl was still probably @entity111 getting within a shot of making the halfway cut in a men ’s @entity132 event at the age of just 14 , the 2004 @entity135 in her native @entity136			0
she beat @entity137 , among others , that day , and look where he is now			0
but earning your place in the field for the biggest event in women ’s golf by seven shots at the age of 11 is startlingly impressive			2
come out swinging : the 11 - year - old will become the youngest - ever participant at a @entity7 asked to name her favourite moment in golf history , @entity1 provoked another sharp intake of breath in going for @entity154 ’s win in the @entity155			1
tell me : is there another 11 - year - old who ’s even heard of @entity160 ? she probably pronounced his name properly as well			0
so to storied @entity17 and a women ’s open that was already historic for the fact it would be the first to be held back to back with the men ’s @entity155 on the same course , albeit a version several hundred yards shorter			2
now here comes @entity1 , snapping her fingers and swinging her arms			2
it is just one of the many reasons why she stands out in the crowd			0
@entity111 : at just 11 , she won both the @entity174 - became the youngest player ever to qualify for an @entity177 event , and the youngest ( 13 ) to ever make the cut at a @entity7			1
@entity87 : previously the youngest ever ( 12 ) to qualify for the @entity7			1
now 19 , she won the @entity179 this year			2
@entity180 : made the cut at last year 's masters at the age of 14 .			0

@entity1 will be at @entity17 on june 19 after winning at @entity8
becomes the youngest - ever *competitor* at the @entity7
@entity1 won the 36 - hole marathon by seven shots
