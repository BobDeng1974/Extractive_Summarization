by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 05:09 est , 29 march 2013 @entity2 people are frequently accused of being reserved , dignified and possessing a stiff upper lip			0
but according to a new survey , that stereotype is a thing of the past			0
instead of keeping private lives tucked away behind closed doors , @entity8 now share a staggering 67 million pictures , videos and snippets of information every week			2
and those who regularly update their @entity16 status or @entity18 feed can be slotted into one of five groups : the @entity21 , the @entity22 , the @entity23 , the @entity24 and the @entity25			1
@entity26 : do you follow @entity28 ? if so , you 'll have seen plenty of pics , all of baby son @entity30 , like this pets : like @entity34 , pictured with her dog @entity36 , ' @entity21 like posting photos of their animal companions ' the study not only gives us new insight into the motivations behind the different groups sharing content online , it also paints a touching picture that as a nation , @entity8 love to spread happiness by sharing the silly stuff , ' said psychologist @entity51 who analysed the results			1
' it has become the modern version of the mix tape or postcard , a way of showing those we ’re close to that we care and we ’re thinking of them			0
' the research , commissioned by mobile phone network three found that almost half of all @entity2 users were so - called ' @entity21 ' who use social media to stay in touch with family and friends			1
innocuous though most of their posts are , @entity21 do have some annoying @entity72 are the users who clog up your @entity18 feed with baby photos and inane comments about their pets			1
the next , and possibly most irritating , group are the @entity22			0
they are the ones who instagram every meal , tweet about @entity83 's every movement and , worst of all , indulge in ' humble bragging '			1
for those yet to come across a humble bragger , these users post thinly disguised boasts which are all the more irksome for the attempt at concealment			2
while the worst offenders are usually celebrities - step forward @entity95 and reality star @entity96 - the trend is filtering through into everyday use			2
typical examples include ' @entity99 told i look like @entity101 today # iamsoconfused ' and ' just gave £ 100 to the homeless man outside the station			1
irrational kindness is so cool			0
' humble brag alert ! if you did n't know that @entity108 star , @entity107 , can play guitar , you do now ! but it 's not all bad news for @entity22			2
according to @entity51 , those who fit into this group love life and are always ready for a good time			0
the next group , the private and self - contained @entity23 , are the opposite of @entity22 , regularly retweeting bad news and ' pre-made content ' ( slogans , ads and so on ) that do n't tell you much about them			1
though their newsfeed looks miserable , @entity23 are n't quite the misanthropes they 'd have you believe , with 12 per cent of @entity2 social media users saying they do it to take their mind off their worries			1
like the @entity22 , the @entity24 just ca n't keep away from social media , with 42 per cent sharing five or more items each week			1
23 per cent of the @entity2 population , mostly students , fit into this category but despite their prolific output , are n't anywhere near as irksome as the @entity22 , thanks to the entertaining content of their tweets			0
mobile magic : made in @entity145 's @entity144 and @entity147 @entity146 demonstrate the ' selfie ' think cool new bloggers or funny pony videos - 78 per cent of those in this group said they regularly share entertaining animal videos			1
self portraits are also a big part of the average @entity156 's feed , as model @entity157 and @entity159 could tell you			0
lastly , there 's the @entity25 , who make up more than a third of social media users			1
this group like nothing more than a great online deal , which they 're all too happy to share on @entity16 - 46 per cent of this group say they do so regularly			2
sharing is n’t necessarily caring though			0
the @entity170 is a savvy sharer and forwards a third of these promotions because doing so provides additional discounts			0
@entity174 , @entity175 commented : ' what is fascinating about this research is the degree of sharing and the different motivations people have for doing it			0
' from practical advice and saving to pure self expression , what is really interesting is the notion that sharing is not always about you , but how you make the recipient feel			0
' @entity190 ' @entity24 ' : we 're looking at you , prolific tweeters , @entity194 and @entity195 ! do you post regular photos of your children or you a past master at the humble brag ? if you do the first , you 're officially a ' @entity200 ' , while the braggers are firmly part of the ' @entity203			1
neither sounds like you ? find your tribe below : big @entity206 @entity22 @entity23 mobile butterflies @entity25			2

humble bragging : ' just got told i look like @entity101 # iamsoconfused '
fifth of @entity8 - *dubbed* @entity24 - share content prolifically
a third are ' @entity25 ' who regularly share money - saving offers
' @entity21 ' are most likely to clog up your feed with baby photos
' @entity23 ' are social media *enigmas* who post *sad* news
