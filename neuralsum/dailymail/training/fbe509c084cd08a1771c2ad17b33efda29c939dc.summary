@entity1 boss @entity0 has raised eyebrows by claiming that @entity3 is city rival @entity4 's best player , above the likes of @entity6 and @entity7			1
@entity0 watched from the sidelines as his @entity1 side held their @entity1 rivals to a 1 - 1 draw in the @entity13 first leg on tuesday night			1
@entity3 's late introduction from the bench changed the game , with the @entity18 winger - a target for @entity20 - setting up an the opening goal for @entity22			1
@entity1 levelled the tie through @entity24 with just two minutes remaining			0
' the game changed with @entity3 , ' @entity0 said			0
' it 's logical - he 's the best player they have			0
' when pressed whether @entity3 deserved to be singled out above @entity4 's so - called galacticos - @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity22 chief among them - @entity0 insisted : ' he 's the player most likely to create openings in the opposition half			1
' it seems the @entity1 manager has a point , as his fellow @entity57 - while well behind @entity6 and @entity7 in terms of goals scored - created the most last season , 22 , compared with 11 made by the @entity61 and 16 by the @entity62			2
@entity1 boss @entity63 would seem to disagree with his @entity0 , however , having started the game with @entity3 on the bench			2
high praise : @entity1 boss @entity0 ( right ) said @entity3 is @entity4 's star player that hurts : @entity6 might have something to say about @entity0 's claim over @entity3 but @entity70 is desperate to add @entity3 to his paper - thin squad at @entity73 following @entity20 's opening - day @entity75 defeat at home against @entity78			1
@entity20 are prepared to commit as much as £ 100million to their pursuit of @entity3			2
@entity80 needs world - class additions and has told executive vice-chairman @entity82 to do all he can to bring the 26 - year - old winger to the club			0
it is understood @entity20 have told @entity3 that , with performance - based incentives , they will pay him around £ 200,000 a week			0
over a five - year deal that would take the club 's investment to £ 100m when a transfer fee of around £ 50m is included .			0

@entity4 and rivals @entity1 drew 1 - 1 in @entity13 first leg
@entity3 set up @entity22 for @entity4 's goal
but the @entity18 winger had started on the bench
@entity1 boss @entity0 hailed @entity3 's impact
the @entity18 winger *provided* 22 assists last season
that is more than @entity6 , @entity7 or @entity22
@entity20 are prepared to invest £ 100m in *signing* @entity3
