if you 've ever missed that perfect photo , scientists may have the answer			1
researchers today revealed a new way to take pictures called compressed ultrafast photography			1
while current phone can take several shots a second at best , it is able to generate two - dimensional ( @entity13 ) colour images at up to 100 billion frames per second			1
the time measurement is in picoseconds - that is one trillionth , or one millionth of one millionth of a second			1
the team were able to capture laser light reflecting off a mirror for the first time using their new camera the new technique , described in this week 's nature , could have a large impact in several areas of research by allowing the measurement of otherwise unobservable , time - evolving , phenomena			1
to demonstrate some of the uses of the technique , the authors imaged laser pulse reflection and refraction , photon racing in two media and faster - than - light propagation of wavefronts			1
in forensics , cup might be used in reproducing bullet pathways , which could once again open up the @entity48 assassination conspiracy theories and revive a more accurate analysis of the strange physics of the ' magic bullet			1
' the team at @entity53 in @entity54 , led by @entity55 , @entity56 , the @entity57 say the camera is the world 's fastest			2
@entity55 and his colleagues have made movies of the images they took with single laser shots of four physical phenomena : laser pulse reflection , refraction , faster - than light propagation of what is called non-information , and photon racing in two media			1
the research appears in the dec. 4 , 2014 , issue of @entity29			2
' for the first time , humans can see light pulses on the fly , ' @entity55 said			2
' because this technique advances the imaging frame rate by orders of magnitude , we now enter a new regime to open up new visions			1
' each new technique , especially one of a quantum leap forward , is always followed a number of new discoveries			2
' it 's our hope that @entity44 will enable new discoveries in science â€” ones that we ca n't even anticipate yet			2
' the camera is a series of devices that works with high - powered microscopes and telescopes			2
once the raw data are acquired , the actual images are formed on a personal computer ; the technology is known as computational imaging			1
' this is an exciting advance and the type of groundbreaking work that these high - risk @entity108 awards are designed to support , ' said @entity109 , phd , program director of optical imaging at the @entity111 , part of the @entity108			1
' these ultrafast cameras have the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of very fast biological interactions and chemical processes and allow us to build better models of complex , dynamical systems			0
' an immediate application is in biomedicine			0
one of the movies shows a green excitation light pulsing toward fluorescent molecules on the right where the green converts to red , which is the fluorescence			0
by tracking this , the researchers can get a single shot assessment of the fluorescence lifetime , which can be used to detect diseases or reflect cellular environmental conditions like ph or oxygen pressure			0
@entity44 photographs an object with a specialty camera lens , which takes the photons from the object on a journey through a tube - like structure to a marvelous tiny apparatus called a digital micromirror device ( @entity148 ) , smaller than a dime though hosting about 1 million micromirrors , each one just seven - by - seven microns squared			0
there , micromirrors are used to encode the image , then reflect the photons to a beam splitter , which shoots the photons to the widened slit of a streak camera			0
the photons are converted to electrons , which are then sheared with the use of two electrodes , converting time to space			0
the electrodes apply a voltage that ramps from high to low , so the electrons will arrive at different times and land at different vertical positions			0
an instrument called a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) stores all the raw data			0
all of this occurs at the breathtaking pace of 5 nanoseconds			0
one nanosecond is a billionth of a second			0
@entity55 envisions applications in astronomy and forensics , where the advanced imaging frame rate could analyze the temporal activities of a supernova that occurred light years away , or track and predict the movements of thousands of potentially hazardous pieces of ' space junk , ' refuse of old satellites and jettisoned space craft hurtling about at high speed in outer space			1
in forensics , cup might be used in reproducing bullet pathways , which could once again open up the @entity48 assassination conspiracy theories and revive a more accurate analysis of the strange physics of the ' magic bullet			0
' in the astronomy world , @entity44 can be a game - changer , @entity55 said			0
' @entity44 imaging with the @entity202 , and we will have both the sharpest spatial resolution of the @entity202 and the highest temporal solution with @entity44 , ' he said			1
' that combination is bound to discover new science			0

can generate @entity13 colour images at up to 100 billion frames per second
could be used to analyse crime scenes and in medical imaging
