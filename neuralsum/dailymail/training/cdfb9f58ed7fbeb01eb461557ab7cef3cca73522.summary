by @entity0 published : 10:56 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 03:49 est , 1 august 2012 in the dock : an artist 's drawing of @entity4 , during his appearance at @entity6 a scene where five police officers were savaged by a pitbull was described as like the ' sickbay after the @entity11 ' as the case against the dog 's owner went before a judge today as the crazed dog mauled officers in a frenzied half - hour attack , its owner and a friend stood by and did nothing , telling them instead : ' you should have just knocked on the door ' , a court was told			1
@entity25 allegedly ignored requests to call the dog off and instead went back into a house with a friend and said : ' mate , there ’s nothing we can do '			1
the pitbull was eventually killed with four blasts from a shotgun - but not before inflicting severe hand , arm and leg wounds , @entity6 heard			1
the powerful dog , which weighed 29kg , pounced on police after officers went to the house in @entity43 , east @entity44			1
it clamped its teeth into one officer ’s upper thigh and tried to drag him to the ground as another policeman repeatedly hit it in the head with a metal battering ram - but his actions made no difference			0
when he eventually prised the animal ’s jaws open with his baton , the dog turned on him grabbing hold of his right forearm and then attacked other police in the front garden			1
it was then @entity25 and another man appeared at the front door , @entity6 heard			1
prosecutor @entity68 said : ' one of the men answered with words to the effect of " we ca n’t , mate there ’s nothing we can do "			0
violence : the dog 's blood spatters the road after police shot the frenzied pitbull , who had inflicted severe injuries on officers in a half - hour attack extreme measures : the dog was killed with four blasts from a shotgun after inflicting hand , arm and leg wounds on the five officers ' one of the men then said in a tone that was utterly sanguine , " you should have just knocked on the door "			1
' after these vignettes were uttered the two men turned around , went back into the house closing no doubt what was left of the front door behind them '			1
amateur video footage of the attack showed police clambering onto a narrow wall to try and escape the crazed dog , with the mauling only ending when a police marksman killed the animal with four shots			1
the jury heard the dog left behind a scene of ' carnage ' in the terraced street			0
mr @entity68 said : ' if you need a useful image in mind of the aftermath of this event , imagine the sickbay after the @entity11 and that will give idea - carnage			0
' victims ( from l - r ) : @entity128 's @entity127 , @entity129 and @entity130 , who were among those , on their way to give evidence against @entity25 @entity25 , 25 , denies four counts of being owner of a dog which caused injury whilst it was dangerously out of control in a public place			1
the charges relate to the dog attack on pc @entity127 , pc @entity129 , pc @entity143 and pc @entity144 who were either attacked in the front garden or in the street as they tried to get the animal off their colleagues on march 22 of this year			1
he is not being prosecuted for the initial attack on pc @entity153 as it happened inside the house			1
mr @entity68 told the jury : ' this case concerns a horrifying episode in central @entity44 this year borne out of a criminal failure by a dog owner to firstly realise the risk his animal posed and secondly to be in a position because of that failure to properly restrain it			1
' through no fault of the animal ’s , its natural instinct manifested themselves in a terrifying display causing injury			0
' no allegation is made that this defendant set his dog on these officers otherwise he would be facing very different charges			2
' however , the conditions in which the dog was kept - the type of premises - the behaviour of the dog towards police officers in the house , and the defendant ’s own attitude towards persons being attacked outside , are all matters that you will want to consider when listening to the evidence in this case			1
' ' it was bolting down the stairs , posing aggressively , baring its teeth but not growling or barking ' police had been at the property to execute a search warrant and had forced their way through the front door , the court heard			2
mr @entity68 said : ‘ officers entered and identified themselves loudly , as one would expect them to do as police officers			1
‘ there was silence and darkness			0
the officers that had entered the premises began searching it , going from room to room			0
‘ @entity211 passed without incident , when out of the silence was suddenly heard the sound of rapid scratching			0
‘ the cause of that scratching noise was a dog of the pit bull type , one that i ’m sure you are familiar with - a powerfully built dog			2
‘ it was that was bolting down the stairs , posing aggressively , baring its teeth but not in fact growling or barking			0
’ the dog first attacked @entity229 , before setting on @entity230 and causing him to run screaming into the street , the court heard			0
@entity232 freed @entity127 , but as he shut the gate the dog leapt at him , continuing to attack as he sought refuge in a police van			1
another officer , pc @entity143 , leapt on a garden wall to get out of the way but was grabbed by the ankle			0
despite banging the dog ’s head in a door pc @entity143 only escaped when he leapt on a car bonnet			2
others attempted to tackle the dog with riot shields , a fire extinguisher and batons but failed to subdue it			0
@entity251 ’ grabbed the dog ’s throat to push it down but had his hand and fingers repeatedly bitten before it was eventually restrained with a riot shield and a noose			2
mr @entity68 said : ' for the first time it would appear the dog was under control			2
but only it would seem through exhaustion			0
at around this point an armed police unit had been summoned			0
‘ it was clearly not the declared intention for serious harm of suffering to be inflicted on the animal , however no specialist dog unit had arrived and the men restraining the dog were either injured or losing their strength from holding it down			0
‘ indeed , no officer could be sure that the noose around it neck was or was going to be effective			0
’ a firearms officer armed with a shotgun then shot the dog three times but it still struggled before a final shot to the head stopped it			2
he said all the officers that were bitten had to have surgery to ' repair the wounds to their bodies '			2
mr @entity68 added : ‘ no allegation is made that this defendant set his dog on the officers , otherwise he would be facing different charges			2
‘ however , the conditions in which the dog was kept , the behaviour of the dog towards the police officers in the house , and the defendant ’s own attitude towards persons being attacked , are all matters that you will want to consider when listening to the evidence in the case			1
’ @entity25 , of @entity43 , east @entity44 , denies four counts of owning a dog that was dangerously out of control in public			1
the trial , which is expected to last five days , continues			0
