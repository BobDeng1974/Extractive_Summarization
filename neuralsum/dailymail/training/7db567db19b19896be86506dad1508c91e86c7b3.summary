by @entity0 a hotel guest who witnessed two people drowning in an unsupervised hotel swimming pool thought they were ' joking ' as part of an elaborate @entity6 weekend , an inquest has heard			1
@entity7 , 31 , and @entity8 , 22 , were discovered floating in an indoor 10.5 - metre swimming pool at @entity10 in @entity11 on the @entity13 and @entity14 border			1
hotel guest , @entity15 , made the grim discovery shortly after 7.30pm on saturday , april 27 last year			1
@entity17 , left , and @entity18 , right , were found drowned at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity13 today an inquest held at @entity20 heard the pair , who could not swim , had been guests at the hotel and were spotted in difficulties by mr @entity15 who mistakenly thought they were ' joshing about '			1
mr @entity15 had arrived at the hotel just hours earlier for a 25th wedding anniversary weekend celebration with his wife and was using the sauna facilities when he heard shouting coming from the neighbouring pool			1
he told the court : ' i saw two people in the middle of the pool - between halfway and two thirds down			1
' there was a lot of splashing going on			1
' the gentleman facing me , i could see his head and shoulders			0
he was shouting " hey " but it could have been " help "			2
the 10 - metre swimming pool at the four - star @entity10 where @entity7 and @entity8 were found dead a picture posted on @entity48 by a hotel guest showed the swimming pool area cordoned off by police ' the lady , whose back was to me , seemed to jump up and put his head underwater			1
i regret to say i thought they were just joshing about			1
' i only had them in sight for around five seconds			0
they seemed to be perfectly healthy - just joking and playing			0
' the jury heard he later returned to the pool following a short time in the sauna , but despite seeing two bodies floating on the surface he still believed the incident may be all part of an elaborate murder mystery weekend			1
he added : ' i started to walk down and immediately saw there were two bodies lying on the surface of the water about two thirds of the way down			1
@entity17 and her grandmother @entity75			0
they fled @entity77 in 2001 ' i thought it was these two fellas messing about			2
i then realised because it was so still and they were so inert there was something seriously wrong			0
' i said something like : " bloody hell "			0
' i ran out of the exit towards the reception			1
i saw a man with a camcorder on the way there and i think , because i had read on the internet they had murder mystery weekends , i told the receptionist " either someone is playing a big practical joke or a terrible accident has happened			2
' " you need to get down there straight away "			0
it was a fairly surreal feeling seeing the scene			0
' ms @entity8 fled to @entity103 with her grandmother from their native @entity77 in 2001 when both her parents disappeared in the country â€™s civil war			1
mr @entity7 , from @entity109 , @entity110 , was married with two children			2
it is understood the pair were in a relationship			2
the inquest heard that post mortems were carried out on both victims which gave the same result of deaths ' consistent with drowning '			0
forensic pathologist , dr @entity122 , who carried out the post-mortem noted a ' heavy vomit contamination ' and evidence given to him suggested neither victim could swim - all supporting the drowning conclusion			0
toxicology results showed neither victim had drugs or alcohol in their system at the time of the tragic accident			2
the jury was told a police investigation had ruled out any suspicious circumstances and water tests disproved any suggestion chemical levels in the water could have affected the pair			1
health and safety signs had been placed around the pool warning of its maximum depth of 2.1 metres , but vital @entity147 footage of the pool had not been working at the time of the incident			1
a policeman stands guard at the @entity10 in @entity13 , where the couple were discovered dead in the swimming pool an engineer had been called to fix problems with the cctv on the morning on the incident - but no temporary measures , such as a lifeguard , were put in place while it was offline			1
@entity161 , district environmental health worker for @entity162 , revealed she had written to the hotel raising ' supervision concerns ' and had planned to revisit the site in may last year - just weeks after the incident occurred			2
she told the inquest : ' if you 're going to not provide supervision , you need to carry out a risk assessment to show what provisions you will have to justify not having a lifeguard in place			0
' i had understood there was supervision of the @entity147 screens which was not the case			0
' mrs @entity161 went on to explain the design of the ' hopper pool ' meant the deep end sloped into the centre of the pool at a maximum depth of 2.1 metres			2
- hotel guest , @entity15 this afternoon one former hotel guest told the court how he had warned hotel bosses about the slope in the pool a year before the tragic deaths			1
@entity191 , 67 , a landscape painter from @entity192 , told bosses : ' if something is not done , i can see someone drowning in that swimming pool			2
' mr @entity191 explained how he had ' almost drowned ' in the pool when he walked from the shallow end towards the deep end during a morning swim in april 2012			1
he said : ' the floor of the swimming pool seemed to fall away and i lost my footing			2
the slope was too steep and i was out of my depth			0
' i almost drowned - i was very alarmed and was in a state of @entity207 got out and asked to speak to a manager			0
' in an ideal world i would have followed up with a letter but i had other things on my mind			0
' i regret that now , obviously			0
' the inquest also heard evidence from receptionist @entity216 , who was working on the front desk at the hotel at the time of the tragic deaths			1
she admitted failing to sign in mr @entity221 and @entity222 to the pool despite it being part of hotel guidelines - something she said happened around 40 per cent of the time if she was busy and guests were impatient			1
when questioned , she told the court : ' the only reason i can think is i was busy doing something at the back			0
' recounting the moment she first learnt of the tragic incident , she added : ' mr @entity15 came to the desk and said two people were either messing around or dead			1
' they were the word he used			0
' @entity240 sat silently as she heard harrowing evidence about the death of her husband at @entity20 today , although no family were present for @entity222			0
the jury were told @entity10 is a large hotel set in 110 acres of woodland			0
the luxurious hotel offers guests a 10.5 - metre swimming pool , sauna and jacuzzi			0
the inquest , which is expected to last three days , continues .			0
