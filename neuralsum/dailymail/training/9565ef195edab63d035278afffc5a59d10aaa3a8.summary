@entity5 has seen five of his siblings die from the same condition called @entity9 which is known to affect just 80 people worldwide			1
two of his brothers and three of his sisters have died from the disease in @entity16 , the poorest state in @entity3			1
the rare condition is known to affect only 80 people in the world , but has killed five of his siblings @entity9 causes rapid ageing and sufferers of the genetic disease are prone to arthritis , eye problems , heart disease and baldness			1
sufferers are not expected to live much beyond the age of 14 - but despite the grim prognosis @entity5 has refused to give up hope			1
‘ i very much want to live and i hope there is medicine for my condition out there			2
i ’m not scared of death but my parents have suffered a lot , ' he said			2
' i ’d love to live much longer for them			0
i do n’t want to burden them with any more pain			0
’ @entity5 ’s parents @entity47 , 50 , and @entity48 , 46 , are first cousins and were the product of an arranged marriage 32 years ago			1
illness : @entity5 's genetic condition effectively has the body of a 110 - year - old because of the rare condition child victim : @entity5 is held by his mother @entity48 , 46			1
she has had eight children and six of them have suffered from @entity9 their children @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 have all died from @entity9 between the ages of 12 and 24			1
a fifth child , a boy who died within 24 hours of being born , is also thought to have had the rare condition			1
@entity68 and @entity48 , who have had eight children in total , do have two healthy daughters - @entity71 , 20 , who is married with two children of her own			1
their youngest daughter @entity73 , 10 , also does not have @entity9			1
when their first daughter , @entity61 , was born in 1983 they had no idea anything was wrong at first			0
it was only after her second birthday when she could n’t eat or walk properly did they visit a doctor			0
but the doctor was baffled and he sent them home with some medicines			0
@entity9 was so rare and poorly documented that most doctors had never heard of it			1
family victims : @entity47 , 50 , ( left ) with his wife @entity48 , 46 , ( right ) and their children			1
@entity71 , now aged 20 , ( back , centre ) does not have @entity9 @entity47 , 50 , and his wife @entity48 , 46 , have had eight children and six of them have suffered from @entity9			1
two years later when their son @entity93 was born , and showed the same symptoms , the family went back to the doctor			2
but again , they were not offered any tests or possible diagnosis			0
@entity47 , who works as a gatekeeper at a factory earning 2,000 rupees - or £ 20 - a month said : ‘ we never heard of the word @entity9 , the doctors never mentioned it			1
they were stabbing in the dark ; they were as clueless as us			0
' if a doctor had perhaps told us that our children were suffering with some kind of genetic problem and we were connected we would ’ve stopped having children			2
’ @entity47 and @entity48 carried on having children hoping they would conceive a healthy boy or girl eventually			1
their wish was granted when they had @entity71			0
in 1995 , after years visiting different doctors , a consultant in @entity119 finally diagnosed four of their children with @entity9 and broke the devastating news that there was no cure for ay of them			1
‘ the diagnosis did n’t help , ’ @entity47 added			1
‘ people were sure there was a cure			0
no one in our community believed there was nothing that could be done			0
' neighbours and extended family tormented us for not getting them help , they could n’t understand a disease with no cure			2
’ life was made unbearable for the five children growing up with @entity9 and they were mocked in school and called names like ‘ big - eyed boy ’ and ‘ @entity146 ’ meaning skinny			2
eventually they all stopped going to school			0
@entity5 , who weighs just 1st 8lbs , said : ‘ none of us have had a childhood , we were confined to our homes			2
' we had each other but that was it			0
when we did go to school we were pushed and shoved , called names , kids tried to harm us			0
we ca n’t do much physically either ; our lungs are so small we get breathless easily			0
illness : @entity5 is fed by his mother			2
@entity9 causes rapid ageing and sufferers of the genetic disease are prone to arthritis , eye problems , heart disease and baldness ‘ i would love to be a normal person who can play , go to school , do some sports , take some risks			1
sometimes i get depressed but most of the time i make the most of the life i have			0
’ @entity5 is now the family ’s only surviving @entity9 sufferer			1
when his brother @entity181 died four years ago he was devastated			2
‘ @entity62 was my best friend , ’ he said			0
‘ i was very young when my other siblings died , so it were just @entity185 and @entity186 for a long time			2
' he was very strong and did n't pay any attention to the bullies			0
when he died i cried for weeks and could n't eat but then i realised i ’d be doing him a huge injustice if i crumbled			2
i have no one now , no friends , but i have to stay strong			0
’ victim : @entity5 , 14 , who weighs just 1st 8lbs , is not expected to live more than a few years longer @entity5 and his parents are now supported by a @entity119 - based charity called @entity197			1
@entity199 dr @entity198 , from @entity119 , introduced the family to the organisation and now they help @entity5 pay for his medical needs			2
@entity5 spends all of his time with his mother and sisters , @entity71 , 20 and @entity73 , ten , and he believes there ’s no one else like him in the world			1
but when told about the famous annual @entity209 , run by the @entity210 , he would love to attend			0
‘ it ’s very lonely living this life , especially since my siblings have gone , ' he added			0
' i do n’t know if there ’s anyone else like me			0
i ’d like to be in the company of other people like me again			0
and i know my brother would be proud of me for doing so			0
