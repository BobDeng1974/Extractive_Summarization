i have been thinking about getting jowl surgery — but before i take that step , i wondered if there was a clever way of disguising the skin with make - up ? i ’ve never had any cosmetic procedures and have n’t had my make - up done professionally for 30 years			1
@entity9 , 69 , @entity10			1
contouring is a make - up technique creating light and shadow using highlighter and darker powder — and it can have magical results			1
it adds volume where there is none , reveals cheekbones you did n’t know you had and gives the illusion of lift to the bits that need it			2
before : @entity28 , 69 ( pictured ) , said she had been considering getting jowl surgery but first wanted to see whether there was a clever way of disguising the skin with make - up techniques even though i have watched top make - up artists do it , i still struggle with contouring , often ending up with a face that simply looks dirty			1
as we get older our skin can sag , especially on the cheeks , around the mouth and on the chin and neck , so highlighting can add lift and structure to the face			1
@entity9 was keen to try it , so using the new @entity47 , £ 52 , make - up artist @entity48 gave her a lesson			1
contouring works best if your base is even and dewy			1
more mature skin tends to be dry , so use a primer over your face and neck first			1
try something like no 7 @entity58			2
@entity48 suggests using a highlighting pen and drawing a ‘ v ’ shape underneath the eyes to brighten dark circles			2
this makes the cheeks look more youthful and shifts the focus up the face away from the jowls			1
gosh @entity68 in @entity69 , £ 6.99 ( @entity70 ) provides the best results			2
the tricky bit if you are using contour powder , a good brush is essential			2
@entity48 used @entity77 ’s contouring brush , £ 40 , which has a diagonally sculpted head that sits perfectly under the cheekbone			1
a quick tip to find this perfect place to apply powder is to suck in your cheeks to make a ‘ fish face ’			1
it will help to show the natural shadow beneath your cheekbones			1
to make the jowls and a double chin look less noticeable , apply the contour powder in a semi-circular shape , taking it from the hollows of your cheeks to under the jawline			1
finishing touches once you have finished the sculpting , you need to bring an element of warmth back into the skin			2
@entity48 suggests dusting bronzing powder on to the areas on the face that sunlight would naturally hit — the temples , cheeks , nose and chin — in a swirling figure of eight			1
try @entity111 , £ 10 ( avonshop.co.uk )			0
for a final touch , add a light dusting of illuminating powder to the cheekbones , down the centre of the nose and on the @entity119 ’s bow			1
this creates a luminous finish , which helps define features and add a youthful glow to the skin			1
verdict after : @entity9 ( pictured ) was thrilled with the results of make - up artist , @entity48 's , lesson @entity9 was delighted with the result			1
two weeks later , i asked her how she was getting on			0
‘ last tuesday evening i was at a meeting and one of the attendees said to me : ‘ @entity9 , you look different			0
what have you been doing ? ’ ‘ i did n’t let on , but said i have been using new make - up			1
i will persevere with the regime and hopefully i wo n’t need any additional help			0
