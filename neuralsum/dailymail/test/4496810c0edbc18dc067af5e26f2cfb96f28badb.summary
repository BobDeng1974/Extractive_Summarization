a @entity1 man has been caught on camera catcalling women in the street â€“ completely oblivious to the fact that the interview he is taking part in is meant to highlight the horrible and derogatory culture of catcalling			1
@entity9 of @entity10 was covering a recent anti-catcalling campaign , which saw signs a series of pro-feminist signs being placed on several streets around @entity1 , when he took to the street to hear opinions from the public			2
and while the women he spoke to all called the practice ' disgusting , ' saying it makes them feel ' horrible ' and ' uncomfortable , ' one man was only too happy to demonstrate his own tactics for harassing women in public			2
unprompted , the man begins demonstrating by whistling and making ticking and kissing noises with his mouth			1
when @entity9 , who looks surprised to have found one of the very street harassers that his other interviewees hit out at , asks the man how he would call a dog , he unabashedly replies : ' the same way '			0
demeaning dude : the man on the right laughs as he admits he would call a dog with the same whistling noises he uses to call out to women on the street ' it feels good , ' the @entity1 man says in response to a question about how catcalling makes women on the receiving end feel			1
the man , who throughout the interview can be seen casting his eyes around seemingly looking for women , then demonstrates his tactics again on a passerby			2
' if it 's far away it 's even better because they 're not that scared , ' he continues , not acknowledging that his comment implies that when women are close to their catcallers , they feel a sense of fear			0
' sometimes you 've got ta have a little distance			0
' highlighting the problem : the video was made in response to anti-catcalling signs like these , which have been put up around @entity1 totally oblivious : the man being interviewed did n't seem to notice that he was being filmed in front of a sign like this one , which says ' no catcall zone ' before the video wraps up , the man finally realizes that the interview is not meant to show catcalling in a positive light , asking : ' wait a second , are you reporting that girls do n't like this ? ' ' they do n't like catacalling , ' says @entity9 insists			1
' get the f * * out of here , ' says the man , who becomes visibly irritated			0
' we 're acknowledging that you did a good thing today getting up out of bed , ' he adds , before getting distracted by another woman and whistling at her while yelling : ' yo , sweetheart ! '			0

the @entity1 man *unapologetically* demonstrates how he harasses women on the street while taking part in an on - camera interview
he insists that the ticking , whistling , and kissing noises he makes at *strangers* makes them ' feel good '
the man also *explains* that *choosing* a woman who is far away from him is better because she wo n't be as ' scared '
