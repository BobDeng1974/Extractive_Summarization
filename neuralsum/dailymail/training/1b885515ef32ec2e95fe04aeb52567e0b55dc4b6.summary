the @entity7 's collection of unique artifacts from 70 years of major historic events , including @entity3 's gun , are on display to @entity7 employees only at their secretive base in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the @entity17 was recovered from the @entity19 compound after @entity3 died in a midnight raid in may 2011			1
personal weapon : the @entity7 's collection features this assault rifle found near @entity3 during the raid on his compound in @entity19 most wanted : @entity3 , often pictured armed in videos and interviews , was eventually killed by @entity29 special forces in may 2011 it was analysed and found to be a @entity31 @entity17 with counterfeit @entity33 markings			1
@entity7 museum curator @entity34 told @entity35 in their exclusive tour of the museum that the explanation for the @entity33 markings remains a mystery			0
the careful planning of the raid is also recorded in the @entity7 's collection , with the model of the compound that former @entity7 director @entity45 used to plan the mission and part of the life - size mock - up of the compound used to practise the raid , on display			2
the mock - up of the @entity19 compound turned out to be pieced together so accurately from intelligence reports that when the seals entered ' they said ‘ we felt like we 'd been there before , '' @entity34 told @entity35 as she showed them around private museum			0
watershed moment : @entity3 's @entity61 hideout , where the @entity17 was discovered after he was killed last pictures : this video seized from the walled compound in @entity19 , showed some of the last images of @entity3 alive careful plans : another artifact at the @entity7 's museum is part of the life - size model of the @entity19 compound , pictured , used to practise the @entity4 ' raid tense moment : president @entity75 , vice president @entity76 , along with with members of the national security team watching the @entity3 raid from the @entity80 although the @entity7 had thought since september 2010 that @entity3 was in @entity19 , it waited to attack until may 2011			1
it found @entity3 's hideout by tracking a man identified as his key courier			1
when the courier was found in @entity19 , the @entity7 began the surveillance that led to the raid			0
after careful practice on the @entity7 's model of the compound , the raid was planned for may			0
via a video camera fixed to the helmet of a @entity4 , the president and his staff at the @entity80 saw the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks shot in the left eye			0
the @entity4 then carried out what is known as a ‘ double tap ’ – shooting him again , probably in the chest , to make certain he was dead			0
following the raid , relations between @entity61 and the @entity106 were put under intense strain amid disbelief that intelligence chiefs in @entity111 had no idea @entity3 was living only 800 yards from the country ’s leading military academy			2
rare access : the exhibits at @entity117 , @entity15 , @entity16 are not open to the general public pieces of history : @entity7 museum curator @entity34 showing @entity35 's @entity121 other remarkable artifacts , such as the enigma machine other recent museum acquisitions from the @entity125 include a partially - burned @entity127 training guide to firing surface - to - air missiles found in @entity129 , as well as the raw lapis lazuli used to pay its members			1
the displays began in the early 1990s but the museum 's collection starts with the agency 's origins running spy networks in the @entity139 when it was known as the @entity140 , through its @entity141 years and right up to the @entity125 since 9/11			2
the @entity140 wing of the @entity7 ’s museum , which opened in 2011 , traces the history of an organisation that was founded in 1942 to aid resistance fighters before it became the @entity7 in 1946			0
the exhibit from the @entity139 period includes counterfeit @entity150 postage stamps created by the @entity140 , the desk of @entity140 director @entity152 , and a selection of false identification documents , maps and escape equipment			2
there is a further layer of top secret artifacts that are not on display even within the @entity7 .			0
