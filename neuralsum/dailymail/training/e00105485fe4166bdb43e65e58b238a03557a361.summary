' my goal is to own @entity3 's dna ' : @entity5 dentist @entity4 , who plans to clone the late @entity6 from genetic information in a wisdom tooth these are the first pictures of the dentist who wants to clone @entity3 from dna taken from the assassinated @entity6 's wisdom tooth			1
@entity4 from @entity12 , @entity5 , bought the molar for nearly $ 33,000 at an auction two years ago and now hopes to extract enough genetic data from it to recreate the musician			1
' if there is enough dna to sequence it , it could be basically genetic real estate , ' he told television vet @entity21 , who tracked him down for a @entity23 programme			1
' my goal is to own @entity3 ’s dna			2
' dr @entity4 revealed that , once cloning technology is far advanced enough to replicate humans , he would clone @entity3 and raise him as his own son			1
' he could be looked at as my son but i do n’t think i would be the one , you know , owning his property , he would have the rights when he was old enough to make a claim , ' said dr @entity4			2
asked how he could ensure the new @entity3 ended up a rockstar , and not a dentist like his own son , dr @entity4 replied : ' he would still be his exact duplicate but you know , hopefully keep him away from drugs and cigarettes , that kind of thing			1
' but you know , guitar lessons would n’t hurt anyone right ? ' mr @entity21 sought out dr @entity4 as part of @entity23 series @entity46 , in which he employs geneticists to apply the latest advances in dna testing to whatever samples he can get hold of			1
aside from @entity3 's tooth , the series follows mr @entity21 as he travels the world to track down body parts purportedly once belonging to high - profile figures including @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 he asked dr @entity4 if he believes he would really ' own ' @entity3			1
' i think i can , because of the laws , ' the dentist told him			0
' depends where you do these things			0
if it ca n’t be done in one country you can do these things in another			0
' dr @entity4 added : ' to have @entity3 's dna sequence outside of the family protection to me , and full access to it , is worth millions			1
' precious : dr @entity4 shows @entity21 the tooth which he paid nearly $ 33,000 for at auction the dentist said that if the first version of @entity83 did n't quite work our as planned , he might be willing to try cloning the musician more than once			1
' well , if it works once it ’s going to work again , right ? ' he said			0
mr @entity4 has previously admitted that it might be some time before he is able to realise his vision of @entity88			2
' animal cloning still has some glitches they are working out but they are already cloning species			0
once the glitches are worked out humans will follow , ' he told cosmetic dentistry comparison site @entity96 last year			0
' there are people in history that everyone is fixated over ... @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity60 ... it will be possible ... and because of this , like the nuclear bomb , it will be happen			0
