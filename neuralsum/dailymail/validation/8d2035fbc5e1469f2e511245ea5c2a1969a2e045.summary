@entity6 who claims he has spent 53 years living in @entity2 - including paying taxes and starting a family - is facing deportation back to the @entity4 after being caught up in an immigration crackdown the 56 - year - old , who lives close to his elderly mother in @entity23 , @entity24 , says he then set up a life for himself in the @entity2 , which involved attending school , paying taxes and working for four decades			1
he also married a @entity2 woman with whom he had three children			2
but , since arriving in 1963 , neither he nor his mother has ever sought to obtain @entity2 citizenship for mr @entity6 , believing he was entitled to stay in the country on account of his mother 's nationality			1
in fact , those who are born to @entity2 parents outside of the @entity2 are not automatically given a permanent right to remain - and he should have applied for citizenship			1
now , the government has decided mr @entity6 should be deported from the @entity2 because he does not have the correct paperwork to allow him to stay			1
mr @entity6 , who has until april 6 to appeal the decision , said : ' i thought it would be all right because i 've been married here , i 've got three kids and all my family are here			1

in 2011 , @entity72 , from @entity73 - who had been trying to get refugee status for seven years but had the claim repeatedly turned down - was allowed to stay in the @entity2 because he said he had a private life that involves going for work - outs with his friends			1
the 40 - year - old 's lawyers argued his human rights would be violated if he was deported because he had become ' well integrated ' in the @entity82 community			0
the controversial legal ruling by @entity85 ’s @entity84 meant the threat of deportation has been removed and @entity72 is free to remain in @entity85 indefinitely			0
@entity72 ’s claim , it said , was ‘ based on @entity90 and , in particular , on the fact that he had , so he claimed , established a private life in the @entity2			2
earlier this month , @entity94 , 55 - who won asylum by claiming he fled @entity96 due to @entity98 discrimination - was allowed to stay in the @entity2 , despite being convicted of killing his wife			2
since being convicted of the crime in his absence during a retrial in 2000 , @entity96 had asked for @entity94 's extradition from @entity2 - but his lawyers fought move they argued that he had right to family life with his new @entity108 partner in the @entity2 - despite the pair living hundreds of miles away from one another			2
in the meantime , @entity94 continued claiming benefits and was convicted of common assault in the @entity2			2
but the @entity115 still ruled that it would be ' oppressive ' to send @entity94 back after so long			0
but mr @entity117 , who is a father to @entity118 , 30 , @entity57 , 20 , and @entity58 , 15 , has now been told to leave the country			0
the @entity120 says mr @entity117 was told he needed to apply for residency in 2007 after being granted a visitor 's visa following a two - month holiday away from the @entity2			1
but officials said he has failed to provide evidence of long term residency in the country - evidence which would usually come in the form of medical history , tax contributions and evidence of education			0
mr @entity6 , who has now split from his wife , says he can not bear the thought of being forced to leave and having to say goodbye to his children			1
he said : ' i have lived here all my life			0
i went to school here , i 've worked here for 40 years			2
' but now i 've been told i 've been working illegally all that time , even though i 've got a national insurance number and paid my taxes			0
' i 've not been sleeping or eating			0
every time i see my daughter she cries and that sets me off			0

it reads : ' @entity152 has a close relationship with his children , who are , in the least to say , devastated by this turn of events , especially his daughter , the youngest child			0
@entity152 's elderly mother is also reliant upon him and would therefore be left without the help and care she currently gets from her son			0
' @entity163 mp @entity162 is also backing his campaign and has asked the government to grant mr @entity6 discretionary leave while he applies for dual nationality			2
mr @entity162 said : ' my office has asked the immigration minister to grant discretionary leave for mr @entity6 to remain ... while he applies for dual nationality , which he has the right to do because his mother is @entity2			1
' i am fully supportive of mr @entity6			0
i do feel that he should be given the right to stay			0
' a @entity120 spokesman said : ' people born overseas to a @entity2 parent do not gain an automatic right to long term residency in the @entity2 , and the onus is on the individual to ensure their immigration status is free of time restrictions			1
' mr @entity6 was told in 2007 of the need to formalise his stay in the @entity2 by providing evidence to support his claim of long term residency			2
he was also advised in writing on three occasions what level of evidence is required but he has still failed to provide it			0
