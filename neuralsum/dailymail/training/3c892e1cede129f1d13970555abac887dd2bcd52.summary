by @entity0 a former @entity2 diplomat has revealed he was ‘ warned ’ by the senior civil servant running the @entity4 not to mention the late biological weapons expert dr @entity6 when giving evidence			1
@entity8 , the @entity2 ’s @entity9 expert at the @entity10 between 1998 and 2002 , said he was told by the ‘ very aggressive ’ official that if he discussed dr @entity6 during his testimony , he would be silenced			1
it is understood the official who delivered the order was @entity16 , secretary of the @entity4 chaired by sir @entity17			2
a former @entity2 diplomat said he was ' warned ' not to mention the late biological weapons expert dr @entity6 ( pictured ) the inquiry was set up in 2009 to examine why @entity20 took @entity2 into war			1
mr @entity8 was a close friend of dr @entity6 , a @entity23 employee and world - renowned scientist who was found dead in an @entity27 wood in 2003			1
dr @entity6 had been named as the prime source of a @entity30 report accusing the @entity31 of lying to take @entity2 into the war			1
having worked with dr @entity6 for several years , mr @entity8 intended to say a few words about him as a tribute which he submitted in earlier written evidence			1
a 2003 public inquiry found dr @entity6 committed suicide			1
but successive governments have refused to hold a full coroner ’s inquest , making him the only person in modern @entity43 legal history to be denied a proper inquest and fuelling claims of a cover - up			2
last month a group of doctors wrote to the chief coroner of @entity43 and @entity50 , @entity51 , urging him to resume the inquest which was halted in 2003			2
the revelation that a witness was informed by an inquiry official what they could and could not discuss before giving evidence raises serious questions about its impartiality			0
sir @entity17 , the head of the @entity4 , was ' incredibly tense ' when evidence was being submitted and this weekend a senior mp who asked to remain anonymous has revealed that when he offered to submit evidence about dr @entity6 ’s death to the inquiry in 2009 , he was told by @entity67 personally that he ‘ did not want to touch the @entity6 issue ’			1
speaking to @entity69 , mr @entity8 , who now runs @entity72 - based diplomatic advisory group @entity71 , recalled the day he gave evidence to the @entity4 in july 2010			1
he said : ‘ i was taken into the room where witnesses sat and shortly before i was to testify an official came in and said , “ you are not to speak about @entity6			2
” ’ he was told that if he did the videolink of his evidence to the press would be cut and he would have to leave			2
having been warned , he kept quiet			0
he said : ‘ i was n’t happy about it			0
i felt very strongly about @entity6			2
he was a man of honesty and integrity			0
the inquiry in 2009 to examine why @entity20 took @entity2 into war ‘ i wanted to remember him in that setting and they prevented me for no good reason			0
what difference would it have made ? it ’s pure control freakery			0
clearly he feared i was going to say something			0
’ when asked if he thought dr @entity6 killed himself , mr @entity8 said : ‘ i do n’t know			1
i would like to see the people who hounded him to his death brought to account			0
it was as good as murder , what they did			0
if you publicly humiliate a man , and you drive him to his death , it ’s as bad as putting hemlock in his soup			0
’ an @entity4 spokesman refused to comment .			0

@entity8 told if he discussed dr @entity6 in testimony , he would be silenced
he intended to say a few words about him as a tribute which he had submitted earlier
