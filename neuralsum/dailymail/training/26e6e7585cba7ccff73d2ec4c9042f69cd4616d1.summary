by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor president @entity2 ca n't play @entity3 on his smartphone			1
no @entity5 , no @entity6 , and no @entity7			0
and he can blame the @entity8			2
a retired @entity8 technical director said thursday that the government spy shop tasked him with custom - fitting a @entity11 for the president			1
that meant stripping away every built - in feature that a hacker might exploit			0
' you try to get rid of any functionality that 's not really required , ' @entity16 told @entity19			0
' every piece of functionality is an opportunity for the adversary			0
' so that means the leader of the free world is n't free to while away his hours crushing pigs with catapulting birds , or trying to come up with a 70 - point play on a triple - word - score box			2
only calls 10 numbers : @entity2 's @entity11 is stripped down to the bare - bones essentials , and ca n't ring up any phone that does n't share his high - level encryption no fun of any kind : the president 's smartphone has no games that a hacker could use as a back - door into his secure communications tech - savvy : @entity2 happily uses an @entity46 , a @entity47 and whatever other secure devices his team puts at his fingertips when @entity2 came into office , @entity16 said , he wanted a way to keep in touch with his closest advisers			1
and the request presented several frightening problems			0
' it just really bothered a lot of people : nobody wanted to put anything out there that was n't completely secure , ' @entity16 explained			0
the president had a @entity11 during his @entity64 career and his presidential campaign			2
ultimately the @entity8 's tech experts chose a model that they could customize most easily to leave him with the barest of bare - bones features			1
what was left when the digital dust settled is a state secret , and the @entity8 wo n't even say whether @entity2 can take pictures or send emails or text messages			1
but the phone is limited to calling only about 10 numbers , since they belong to aides – and , presumably , family members – whose phones use the same type of encryption			1
the @entity85 reported this year that the @entity86 was considering a switch to @entity88 , and was testing @entity90 and @entity91 phones			1
@entity11 insisted at the time , however , that ' the @entity1 government continues to choose @entity11 for its unmatched security and cost effectiveness			2
' ' other vendors such as @entity91 and @entity90 still have a long way to go to catch up to meet the government ’s stringent requirements and certifications , ' the company said in a march statement			0
@entity102 , formerly the technical director of @entity8 's @entity103 , told @entity19 that he was in charge of retrofitting @entity2 's phone so it would n't present a national security risk the @entity8 's @entity16 said president @entity108 ( @entity109 ) may have had access to a mobile phone , but it would have been a giant ' brick ' like the mock - worthy device sported by @entity115 on ' @entity116 ' ( r ) parting is such sweet sorrow : @entity2 , pictured the day he was sworn in as president in 2009 , had to get ri of the smartphone that got him through the presidential campaign the president reportedly uses an @entity46 for reading and an encrypted @entity47 for his daily work			1
@entity16 told @entity125 that he was n't sure if presidents before @entity2 used smartphones , but he hinted that any presidential mobile phones before 2008 were ' like a brick			2
' if @entity108 had one , he said , ' i 'm betting he did n't know it was five pounds because i 'm betting he did n't carry it			0
' @entity125 quipped that in the @entity134 and @entity108 years , an aide would have carried it because it ' looked like the one @entity115 used on the 1990s sitcom , " @entity116 "			0

the president has to use *personal* digital devices that the @entity8 has retrofitted with world - class encryption
@entity11 leads the field in robust security , but the @entity86 is testing @entity88 devices
@entity2 's phone can only call about 10 numbers – phones that can match his for encryption and data protection
the @entity8 gave him a stripped - down smartphone with no games , and likely no *selfie* - camera or texting function
