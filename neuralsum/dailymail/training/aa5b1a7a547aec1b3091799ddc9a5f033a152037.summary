by @entity0 for @entity1 for many people living in towns and cities , growing flowers , fruits or vegetables is out of the question			2
but a team of inventors from @entity11 has unveiled a device that makes it possible , via an indoor greenhouse that can be controlled by a smartphone			1
by connecting their phone to the greenhouse , people will be able to grow fruit and vegetables in their homes without needing access to a garden			1
the indoor gadget boasts a built - in miniature computer that detects when plants need water and the ideal temperature for their growth the device uses a fully automated hydroponic system , with sensors and actuators , to simulate real environmental conditions			1
to start growing , a user just tells the app what sort of plant has been selected			0
a programme specific to that plant will then load , initiating a lighting and irrigation sequence and the right conditions for the type of plant and its stage of growth			0
as it grows , the app will ask for feedback , for example , ‘ can you see any leaves ? ’ the software will then adjust its settings based on this feedback to provide an even better environment for your plant to thrive			2
the company claims you can grow almost anything that will fit in the tray			2
this includes house plants , flowers , vegetables , several kinds of fruits and various herbs			1
however you ca n’t grow root vegetables just yet , although this will be available in the near future			1
in a week the standard sized greenhouse can grow three to five tomatoes , two to three peppers and one lettuce at peak function			2
source : @entity86 the indoor gadget uses a built - in miniature computer that detects when plants need water and the ideal temperature for their growth			2
the glass - sided device uses special sensors to pick up these readings , which then automatically activate different parts of the machine			0
and the device warms up , cools down , turns on a light or waters the plants autonomously without input from the user			2
the contraption , called @entity103 , can be used to grow flowers , fruits , vegetables or herbs			1
it will come in three sizes and is delivered in an easy - to - assemble kit			0
once a user has planted their desired seeds they simply choose which crop it is from a list on the @entity118 smartphone app. the machine then adjusts the settings to match the requirements for that specific plant			0
@entity103 is the brainchild of @entity11 pair @entity124 , 32 , and @entity125 , 27			1
mr @entity124 said : ' i kept seeing trucks filled with different vegetables ready to be delivered to various countries and it made no sense to me			0
' i started wondering what happened , why the production had gone that far from the consumer			0
' the answer i found was because we just ca n't grow them ourselves because of the lack of time , space , conditions or skills			0
' i decided to start using technology to make the whole process simple and to enable everyone to grow their own food wherever they are			0

users can sit back and relax as the device warms up , cools down , turns on a light or waters the plants the contraption , which called @entity103 , is controlled using an app on a smartphone			1
pictured is founder and ceo of @entity103 @entity124 upon release in january 2015 it is expected a mini version will cost around £ 176 ( $ 299 ) , the standard about £ 205 ( $ 349 ) and the premium about £ 235 ( $ 399 ) he continued that they wanted to aim the product at city dwellers who have no time or space , yet still want to be ' green '			1
' @entity118 is based in hydroponic technology , which is a soil-less way to grow plants , where the plant takes nutrients directly from the water , ' he said			1
' the @entity118 controls the temperature , humidity , and light cycles and the automated irrigation system will also water and feed your plants whenever they need it			2
' it is connected to the internet and there is a smartphone app that sets the right growing variables according to your chosen plant			0
' with hydroponics and our current range of sizes , you can grow just about anything that will fit inside the tray , apart from trees and root vegetables			1
' the team behind @entity103 raised about £ 91,000 ( $ 151,000 dollars ) on crowdfunding website @entity206			1
