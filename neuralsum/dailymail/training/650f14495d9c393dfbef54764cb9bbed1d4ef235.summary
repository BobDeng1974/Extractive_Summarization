by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 doubts whether @entity3 will ever win a world title			1
not only does @entity2 expect to beat his challenger a second time in saturday 's super re-match at a sold out @entity7 but he does not expect the younger @entity8 to succeed him as world super-middleweight champion once he retires			1
' @entity3 is not tough enough to succeed at the highest level , ' says @entity2			1
' he 's not a 12 - round championship fighter			2
he 's a light - heavyweight who struggles to get down to 12 stone			1
but it 's not only physical			0
' genetically he 's fragile			0
he 's not cut out for this sport at world level			0
as an amateur you can become an @entity27 or @entity29 champion without your heart being tested			2
' he has the skills but not the strength of heart or mind for the top of the pro game			2
' at 36 , @entity2 is still looking ahead to a major fight in @entity38 , perhaps against @entity40 @entity39 who is the only opponent he has not beaten			1
not up to it : @entity2 says @entity3 is not a natural super-middleweight there is also the prospect of completing a trilogy of mega-bouts with the only other man to defeat him , @entity48 warrior @entity47 , who has announced his comeback from retirement			1
' i love boxing and i 'm very good at it			0
' i get an obscene amount of money for doing it			0
so why should i stop			0
? ' no love lost : @entity2 and @entity3 will do battle again in the ring in front of 80,000 fans getting the job done : @entity2 have to dig deep to comeback and win the first fight against @entity3 while he does not expect to still be fighting at 40 , @entity2 suspects that @entity3 , at 25 , missed his best chance of a title in their controversial first fight			1
he says ; ' if he was ever going to beat me or ever going to get a world title it was then			0
he had the gift of my mistake which let him knock me down in the first round but he could n't finish the job			0

@entity2 does not believe @entity3 has the *ability* to go 12 rounds
@entity81 *believes* is @entity3 is more suited to light - heavyweight than super-middleweight
@entity3 does not have the heart or mind to be a champion , according to @entity2
@entity2 eyeing a final fight in @entity38 against @entity39 or @entity47
