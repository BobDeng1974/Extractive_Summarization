@entity0 , pictured , helped found the satirical magazine @entity1 in the early 1960s there ’s something about laughter in the face of death , a refusal to take yourself too seriously even at the end , that is peculiarly @entity11			1
@entity0 , the author who died on tuesday , aged 71 , spent her life in love with @entity14 , and laughing at herself			1
the daughter of the poet laureate @entity16 , she helped to found the satirical magazine @entity1 in the early sixties with several friends , including @entity19 and editor @entity20			1
as many of this hard - drinking , rambunctious crew died during the @entity23 , @entity0 was diagnosed with breast cancer and joked : ‘ if i die , @entity20 will have hardly anyone to go to funeral services with			1
’ she recovered , to the relief of a wide circle of friends in whom she inspired adoration			1
the campaigning left - wing journalist @entity31 had called her ‘ the most beautiful woman in @entity33 ’ during her student days and in @entity35 she was close to actor @entity36 , gambler @entity37 , @entity39 and @entity40			1
indeed , she sometimes said that her great regret in life was that she had n’t ‘ gone the whole hog ’ with the @entity44			1
but it is as a writer , not a socialite , that she will be remembered			1
her books included a memoir , over @entity50 ; a guide to the capital ’s disappearing architecture called @entity54 , and @entity14 , a collection of her columns in the @entity58 magazine			1
a close friend of prince @entity60 , she wrote the definitive handbook to his @entity63 estate , @entity64			1
she was a war baby , born in 1942 , and as a child lived at @entity66 in the @entity67 of the @entity68 where her family ’s cottage was overlooked by the ancient chalk carving			1
her father , whose imagination was fired by steam trains and cricket on the green , instilled a love of @entity11 heritage in her			1
childhood car journeys on holiday to @entity81 used to take four days , as @entity16 stopped to examine every canal lock , parish church and tumbledown farmhouse			1
‘ @entity14 is my nirvana , ’ she said			2
‘ i will never tire of exploring it			2
compared with any other country , its variety is astonishing			2
one minute you can be high in great , gloomy , rugged moorland and the next deep in a verdant valley with thatched cottages strung along the fern - banked lanes			2
’ all her life she would revisit @entity96 in @entity81 , reliving the family pilgrimage			2
she felt the memories defined her soul			2
her father , though he was content to stop for hours to inspect cathedrals and abandoned railway stations , would lose his temper if their battered @entity103 got stuck in a narrow country lane behind a lorry			2
‘ he used the word “ bloody ” a lot , ’ she said			2
@entity16 ’s idea of fun was to tell his daughter that she must marry his friend @entity112 , a crusty old @entity33 don			1
she was not sure if this was a joke , but she had no intention of obeying — she rarely did anything she was told as a child			2
an enthusiastic rider , one of her favourite games in summer was to gallop through fields of corn , often seriously damaging the crop			2
‘ i was very naughty , and behaved pretty badly really , ’ she recalled gleefully			2
@entity0 , second left , was the daughter of @entity16 , left , pictured at their home in @entity126 around 1948 with her brother @entity127 and mother @entity130 - and dog @entity129 this idyllic childhood ended in 1954 , when she was sent to boarding school			1
‘ i was a revolutionary at heart , ’ she said , ‘ so i hated it			2
’ a half - hearted attempt to study sculpture at @entity139 followed , before she joined @entity20 and others including @entity141 and @entity142 at the @entity143			0
self - deprecating as ever , she claimed she had earned a place in their @entity147 revue because the producer had heard her singing in the bath			0
what he was doing in her bathroom , she never attempted to explain			0
a few months later , in @entity54 , during a short - lived stint as a magazine sub-editor , she met @entity157 tailor @entity156			1
an obsessive gambler who played poker till the small hours , he played backgammon with customers in the window of his shop			0
his designs ushered in the multi-coloured peacock attire of the @entity167 , with gold - embroidered jackets and rainbow ties			0
his shop did for men what @entity171 was doing for women , offering ‘ a young man ’s view of cut and proportion ’			0
as a child , @entity0 , pictured , was an enthusiastic horse rider who rarely obeyed her parents ' wishes @entity0 claimed it was his flair on the dance - floor that won her heart , but it was also his cavalier sense of adventure			1
he had a sporty @entity186 , and drove it so violently that @entity0 ’s beehive hairdo would collapse as he took corners			1
they married and on honeymoon attempted to drive around the world in a @entity193			0
it was stoned by locals in @entity196 , held up at gunpoint in @entity198 , and overturned in @entity199 in @entity200			0
in @entity202 , the newlyweds found themselves in a military coup , and in @entity204 they were adopted by @entity206 separatists who took them clubbing at the city ’s decadent @entity209 club			1
back in @entity54 , they were more fashionable than ever			0
@entity212 @entity211 wanted a @entity0 suit , and in lieu of payment did a drawing of @entity0			1
her magazine career , though , was scuppered when the editor caught her working for his rival , private eye — although her job was stapling the pages together and handing out advertising on the @entity224			1
but no @entity16 would be deterred that easily from writing			0
as her family grew — she and @entity156 had five children — she did what her father had done and started writing bedtime stories			0
these became the basis of two children ’s books about @entity233 the @entity234			0
@entity0 , centre , pictured alongside author @entity236 , left and the @entity237 , right , was a close friend of the @entity60 and even wrote the definitive guide to the gardens of his @entity240 in 1970 , angry that her husband had gone to the football @entity243 in @entity245 with a group of friends , she persuaded the editor of the @entity249 to send her to the tournament as the paper ’s cultural correspondent by arguing that football was the purest form of cultural achievement			1
she spent most of her time partying with the @entity14 squad ’s wives			0
in the @entity258 , she took over @entity1 ’s architecture column , @entity260 , from her father , and began a passionate defence of @entity14 ’s buildings that would last the rest of her life			1
she became a commissioner for @entity266 with a special enthusiasm for protecting churches and cathedrals — a role that would have thrilled her father			0
he died in 1984 , and she spent the rest of the @entity273 editing his letters			0
she celebrated allotments , cooling towers and seaside resorts — and presented @entity279 documentaries on the suburban front garden , and the nation ’s love of horses , as well as a series for @entity285 on the cottages of @entity14			0
both the gardens and the cottages inspired spin - off books that became best - sellers and provided valuable income , because the family finances were often shaky			0
@entity0 married @entity156 , left who was a tailor based in @entity54 's @entity157 @entity0 was a fierce defender of the monarchy , once writing to the @entity294 to declare indignantly that no @entity296 star had ever been half so much in demand as the @entity299 , who received countless requests to attend every kind of event , from international summits to children ’s parties			1
after being diagnosed with breast cancer , her matter - of - fact courage was an inspiration to countless women			0
after recovering , she undertook a 200 - mile journey on horseback to raise £ 125,000 for the complementary care centre at the @entity313 cancer hospital in @entity33			0
last year she was told she had inoperable cancer of the pancreas and would live just a few months			0
her response was as wry as ever			0
exasperated that the disease came so low down the league table of research as to be ‘ the @entity320 of tumours ’ , she began fund - raising for more research into pancreatic cancer — too late to help herself but , typically , a life - saver for sufferers in the future			0
in her introduction to @entity16 ’s letters , she wrote : ‘ i love my father and want to show the world how great he was , how he revealed the divine in the ordinary and enriched so many people ’s lives			0
’ she deserves nothing less for her own epitaph .			0
