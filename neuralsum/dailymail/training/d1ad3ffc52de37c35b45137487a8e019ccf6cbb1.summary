cynical tactics : @entity1 pictured with his daughter @entity2 @entity1 cynically used his 18 - year - old daughter @entity2 in a desperate bid to smear @entity5 over her use of illegal drugs , @entity8 can reveal today			1
the embittered advertising mogul encouraged his former wife @entity10 and their daughter to release a damning statement claiming that ms @entity5 had used drugs ‘ regularly and heavily each night ’ months before her use of cocaine and cannabis was revealed in court			1
an explosive document , which was endorsed by @entity2 and @entity10 , claims : ms @entity5 has strenuously denied these allegations			1
the fresh revelations come as ms @entity5 gives her first interview since her former housekeepers were found not guilty of a £ 685,000 credit card fraud			0
she told @entity25 that she has ‘ toughened up ’ in the last year , adding in a statement sent through her publicist @entity27 : ‘ i will survive this and move forward			2
i just want to focus on family life and work			0
’ in court earlier this month , ms @entity5 admitted snorting cocaine six times – to help deal with her late husband @entity37 ’s terminal illness and when subject to ‘ intimate terrorism ’ by mr @entity1			1
she also admitted cannabis use but has categorically denied she was a ‘ habitual user ’ of @entity42 night friends of the chef described claims that she used drugs every night as ‘ ludicrous ’			1
leaking the document to @entity25 demonstrates the extraordinary lengths to which mr @entity1 was prepared to go in order to destroy his wife ’s reputation			2
the sensational statement , partly written by @entity53 – @entity1 ’ second wife – was sent in july , after the now infamous picture of him with his hands around @entity5 ’s throat emerged , leading to the couple ’s divorce			1
infamous scene : @entity61 appears to tweak ms @entity5 's nose at @entity64 's restaurant in june row : @entity61 and @entity65 are pictured arguing outside their @entity67 home in 2004 it begins : ‘ i am furious that my daughter , @entity2 , was put into a dangerous environment with the heavy drug use of @entity5			1
’ she adds : ‘ [ @entity5 ] tried to involve [ my ] daughter in this arrangement but she refused , but kept it quiet from her father and [ me ] until the furore about @entity5 and @entity1 ’ relationship			1
’ the story about @entity5 ’s alleged ‘ drug nights ’ was planted on july 12 , a fortnight before the couple were divorced , at the start of a sustained campaign against the tv chef orchestrated by public relations executive @entity87 , who has claimed to be advising mr @entity1			1
second wife : @entity2 's mother @entity53 at the time , @entity8 did not run the contentious statement for legal reasons			2
but following the trial of former housekeepers , @entity94 and @entity95 , it can now be revealed			0
the girls claimed in court that ms @entity5 was a regular drug user			1
the @entity8 received the statement via email following a telephone call from a source close to mr @entity1 about ‘ concerns ’ he wanted to air			1
the statement was written by an anonymous friend but endorsed by @entity2 , as she confirmed in a phone call where her father was present			0
after stating that ms @entity5 tried to involve @entity2 in drug taking , it added : ‘ when @entity2 ’s father learnt the truth from her , and from the staff in the house who would regularly find evidence , and also in @entity5 ’s top floor study each morning , he and @entity10 were horrified			1
‘ @entity10 and @entity1 learnt that @entity5 used drugs regularly and heavily each night , for an hour after dinner , and another hour before bed			1
it was a large house , and @entity1 spent his evenings in their bedroom , and could n’t smell the evidence because they closed the doors to the upstairs and lit scented candles			1
' @entity5 had also installed an air fragrance distribution system throughout the house			1
the drug nights grew in regularity till they became a permanent feature in the last year			1
' @entity2 believes that was when @entity5 grew distant and cold with her for not joining in			2
that was also when @entity5 ’s relationship with her father became distanced and distracted			0
‘ @entity5 additionally had her staff prepare an extra two large versions [ of joints ] , on a daily basis to be left on her desk , for her to consume privately during the night while her husband was asleep			1
‘ @entity10 feels that attempting to entice her daughter @entity2 into this druggy world was unforgivable ; that she was young and vulnerable to peer pressure			2
’ the statement went on to say that @entity2 kept the allegations ‘ quiet ’ until she could see how deeply her father was upset about the break up with ms @entity5			1
she then decided to ‘ tell both her parents the truth about my stepmother ’			0
mr @entity1 told @entity8 via email : ‘ i feel like an idiot being the only person in the house who knew nothing about the drugs			1
the more details i received from the staff the more betrayed i felt			0
’ for months , rumours were fed to the media by a fast - talking pr about drug - taking in the @entity161 household			0
the man behind the storm of rumours circulating online is a former salesman who has made different claims about his relationship with @entity1			0
@entity167 - born @entity87 had said he was a ‘ behind - the - scenes svengali ’ to @entity61			2
he claimed to be a valued adviser but also said he was not on the art collector ’s payroll			0
@entity87 , who lives in @entity172 and favours wearing a @entity173 , writes a blog , @entity175			0
he posted a series of pieces about @entity5 and allegations of her drug taking – and was then threatened with legal action by her lawyers			0
in an interview with @entity183 , @entity87 conceded he had not spoken to @entity61 about the incident at @entity64 ’s restaurant – yet later told journalists he was a ‘ behind - the - scenes svengali ’			1
but friends close to @entity61 said @entity191 had simply ‘ fed @entity61 fascinating titbits ’ of information about @entity5 , and was not working for him			1
the two only met , they claim , when @entity87 called @entity61 to say @entity5 had threatened him with legal action			2
@entity191 , a former salesman for media giant @entity193 , is a self - styled pr guru who also claimed to have represented three stars of the @entity199 ’s @entity198 ’ den. but @entity201 , briefly a client , said he ‘ would not recommend him ’			0
ms @entity5 insisted she was not a ‘ drug addict or a habitual drug user ’ and denied ever authorising the @entity203 ’ extravagant purchases , as they had claimed , in exchange for them keeping her habit secret			1
mr @entity1 also denied in court that he leaked an email to the defence in which he called his ex-wife ‘ hi - gella ’ and accused her of poisoning her daughter @entity214 , 19 , with drugs and ‘ trashing her life ’			1
last week , police said they would not be taking any action over ms @entity5 over her drug - taking , unless fresh evidence emerged			0
when she took the stand at @entity224 to give evidence against her two former aides last week it was clear ms @entity5 felt it was she who was on trial			0
forced to go into detail about her drug - taking , the 53 - year - old spoke of ‘ a long summer of bullying and abuse ’ and singled out a pr blog she said had been ‘ dedicated to salvaging mr @entity1 ’s reputation and savaging mine ’			1
in that online journal , @entity87 made a series of intimate and defamatory allegations about ms @entity5 before emailing them to influential members of the media			0
mr @entity1 denied in court that he leaked an email to the defence in which he called his ex-wife ' hi - gella ' and accused her of poisoning her daughter @entity214 , 19 , with drugs and ' trashing her life ' more mysterious , however , is how he became embroiled in the marriage breakdown – or came to ‘ represent ’ mr @entity1 in such a machiavellian pr campaign			1
more bizarrely , mr @entity87 appeared to be simultaneously working for the @entity95 sisters			0
it was he who put their signed statements online before the court hearing , although ms @entity5 ’s solicitors quickly had them removed			0
last night mr @entity87 refused to make any comment , and @entity258 , the @entity95 sisters ’ solicitor , did not return @entity25 ’s call			0
the offensive began on july 23 , just over two weeks after @entity1 revealed in @entity25 that he was divorcing his wife			2
mr @entity87 wrote an account of the now infamous incident outside @entity64 ’s restaurant on june 9 , claiming the pictures of mr @entity1 grasping ms @entity5 around the throat were set up			2
the next day ms @entity5 threatened to sue mr @entity87 , but he refused to take down the offending material			2
on the july 31 , ms @entity5 and mr @entity1 were granted a decree nisi			2
two days later , mr @entity87 tweeted a link to another blog in which he claimed ms @entity5 had used the pictures to leave a marriage ‘ that has been on the rocks for over a year according to sources ’			2
on august 5 , mr @entity87 e-mailed the media insisting that the photographs were a ‘ slur ’ against mr @entity1			2
in an interview with the @entity183 in july this year the publicist said he had not spoken to mr @entity282 about the incident but by september he was telling journalists he was an unofficial adviser			0
and as the @entity95 trial approached , mr @entity87 ’s emails became more sensational			0
in his final missive on november 11 , just 16 days before the start of the court case he wrote : ‘ @entity5 ca n’t hide from years of deception and cocaine abuse			2
’ friends close to mr @entity1 said that mr @entity87 had simply fed the art dealer ‘ fascinating titbits ’ of information about his estranged wife , and was not working for him			1
but those who have worked with @entity61 in the past say he is ruthless in the way he cuts people out of his life			0
one , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ if you leave @entity61 and @entity303 you die … you do n’t exist anymore			0
it ’s a bit like chairman @entity306			0
you ’re simply written out of history			0
’ was there a grain of truth in @entity5 ’s claim that the campaign was designed to savage her reputation ? mr @entity87 is n’t saying			0
nor has he tweeted or emailed since the trial began , nor since the verdict of not guilty was returned last friday .			0

art tycoon launched @entity319 offensive after daughter told him wife used drugs
statement claimed @entity65 had used drugs ' regularly and heavily each night '
came months before her use of cocaine and cannabis was revealed in court
it alleged she used drugs for an hour after dinner and an hour before bed
also claimed staff would prepare two large joint a day for her to smoke while @entity61 was asleep
claims have been strenuously denied by @entity65 today
@entity5 was a habitual user of drugs and would take them every night for ‘ an hour after dinner , and another hour before bed ’ .
drug use became a ‘ permanent feature ’ of her *lifestyle* and alienated her from her *stepdaughter* , @entity2 , who refused to take part .
she would ask staff to prepare large joints of strong cannabis for her to smoke while her husband was asleep .
that she would cover up the effects of cannabis and other illegal drugs by telling @entity1 she had taken sleeping *tablets* .
she also used scented candles to cover the smell and even installed an air fragrance system in her @entity67 home to keep her habit secret from her husband .
