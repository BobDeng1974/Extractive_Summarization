a charred toad 's leg has been discovered alongside fish bones at a site just one mile away from @entity2 in @entity19 and is the earliest evidence of a cooked toad or frog anywhere in the world , scientists said			1
the leg dates to between @entity25 and @entity26 - some 5,000 years before the prehistoric monument was built - and eaten 8,000 years earlier than the @entity6 and @entity28 were documented as enjoying the delicacy , which they claimed as a national dish			0
archaeologists unearthed the leg alongside small fish vertebrate bones of trout or salmon as well as burnt aurochs ' bones ( the predecessors of cows ) at the @entity40 dig site near @entity42			1
@entity43 , senior research fellow in archaeology at the @entity45 , said : ' it would appear that thousands of years ago people were eating a @entity58 - style menu on this site , one - and - a - quarter miles from @entity2 , consisting of toads ' legs , aurochs , wild boar and red deer with hazelnuts for main , another course of salmon and trout and finishing off with blackberries			2
' this is significant for our understanding of the way people were living around 5,000 years before the building of @entity2 and it begs the question - where are the frogs now ? ' the latest information is based on a report by fossil mammal specialist @entity71 , of the @entity73 , who examined the discoveries from the dig which has resulted in 12,000 finds , including 650 animal bones , all from the mesolithic era			0
a charred toad 's leg has been discovered alongside fish bones at a site just one mile away from @entity2 ( pictured ) in @entity19 and is the earliest evidence of a cooked toad or frog anywhere in the world , archaeologists said dr @entity43 said it would appear people were eating a @entity58 - style menu near @entity89 of years ago , including toads ' legs , ( frog 's legs are pictured ) mr @entity43 said that he hoped the discoveries would help confirm @entity42 as the oldest continuous settlement in the @entity96			1

@entity103 , chairman of @entity104 and @entity105 and co-ordinator of the community involvement on the dig , said that the studies at @entity42 could help explain why @entity2 was created			1
he said : ' no one would have built @entity2 without there being something unique and really special about the area			0
' there must have been something significant here beforehand and @entity40 , with its constant temperature spring sitting alongside the @entity119 , may well be it			0
' i believe that as we uncover more about the site over the coming days and weeks , we will discover it to be the greatest , oldest and most significant mesolithic home base ever found in @entity96			2
currently @entity126 - 40 miles from @entity42 - is proving to be the oldest continuous settlement in the @entity96 , with @entity42 104 years younger			1
' by the end of this latest dig , i am sure the records will need to be altered , ' he added			0

the discovery by archaeologists from the @entity45 , is the earliest evidence of a cooked toad or frog anywhere in the world
the *remains* could help confirm @entity42 in @entity19 as the oldest continuous settlement in the @entity96 and explain why @entity2 was created
