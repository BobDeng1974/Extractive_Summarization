it remained a royal palace until 1581 when @entity21 gave it to her @entity23 , @entity24			1
the fortified property dates back as far as 1045 ad when it was occupied by @entity26			1
@entity26 's rule : @entity1 exchanged @entity4 in 1523 for other lands with sir @entity6 , who served as a diplomat under @entity9 @entity31 history : parts of the fortified property date back as far as 1045 ad when it was occupied by @entity26			1
under @entity1 the tower was converted into a dove cote , housing birds for the king to eat hunting ground : @entity1 carried out minimal works to the manor and in 1542 ordered the laying out of a deer park so he could hunt in the castle 's grounds in recent years the @entity47 i listed home , regarded as one of @entity51 ’s greatest historical houses , became little more than a ruin			2
but the current owners , the @entity55 family , have spent the past 16 years setting about saving @entity4			1
@entity56 , 75 , who owns the property , said : ' @entity1 effectively used @entity58 as his private @entity59 when visiting the south of @entity61 on state affairs			1
' he certainly would never have brought any of his wives here but is known to have taken his mistresses to the house instead			1
' he made many large improvements to the house because he was concerned about an invasion and wanted a permanent castle on the south coast			1
' very little else is known about what actually happened when @entity1 visited @entity58 because next to nothing was written down , said mr @entity56			2
' he also developed the gardens for his daughter @entity75 who he hoped would move in , ' he added			2
' although there 's no evidence she ever even visited the manor			0
' it was @entity21 instead who used the property , often entertaining more than 300 guests at any one time with lavish feasts that could last for days			1
but in 1581 she was forced to give the castle up to @entity24			1
in the royal hands : @entity1 exchanged other lands for the manor in 1523 and it was held as a royal palace until his daughter , @entity21 , gave it away , probably to cover her debts @entity96 courtyard : under @entity1 's rule , this part of the gardens would have been a vast courtyard where @entity1 would have rode into followed by dozens of soldiers as he visited the southern corner of his realm fit for a king : this would have been @entity1 's banquet hall where he entertained guests with lavish feasts of pigeon , deer , boar and lots of wine ' @entity21 did n't like @entity24 at all , ' says mr @entity56			1
' in fact she was most probably intimidated by him ... not least because he stood at a giant 5 ' 7 "			0
' his job was to collect customs in the south of @entity61 and raised more than £ 30,000 - a whopping sum in those days			0
given her dislike for @entity24 , she most likely gave it to him because she owed him money			1
what we do know is that no cash ever changed hands between them			0
' the @entity56 family , a family of engineers , bought the castle from the @entity133 and started carrying out millions of pounds of sensitive restorations with the help of @entity136			0

this includes an outbuilding with kitchen , bar and toilets joining a large marquee			0
but there are significant running costs involved with the upkeep of the grand property , with maintenance costing around £ 100,000 a year			2
however , the manor is a money maker , hosting around 25 weddings each year			0

it has ancient “ graffiti ” to the inner left side jamb of the window said to depict @entity196 the grounds of @entity4 also boast two remarkable 16th century @entity47 i list barns which are being offered separately			1
one of these has one of the finest hammer beam roof structures in the @entity202 while the other is needs to be restored			0

' all the essential work is done , we have never had any archeology work carried out because of the huge cost , instead we saved our pennies for the restoration			0
' my wife , who i have been married to for 52 years , loves the property			2
you try hard not to fall in love with it but it 's hard			0
' we 've had so many special times here from parties and birthdays to family weddings			0
i think it is the best place in the world but i 'm 75 now			0
it has been a great experience , we love it but it is time to move on			0
' the castle was under @entity1 's ownership from 1523 until his death in 1547 at the age of 55			2
during that period the property was extended with separate suites of rooms for the use of royalty and at one point it had 126 rooms			1
in 1552 , @entity24 , a collector of @entity269 , moved into the castle with his wife @entity271 following their marriage			1

mr @entity56 has been hosting weddings at the property for eight years , which he describes as ' very successful '			2
