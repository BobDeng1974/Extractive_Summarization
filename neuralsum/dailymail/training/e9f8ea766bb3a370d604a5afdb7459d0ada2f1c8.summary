by @entity0 published : 18:42 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 18:46 est , 28 august 2013 after a career spent bringing other people ’s stories to life , it is his own story that is perhaps the most touching of all			2
film director @entity9 is as much in love with his wife @entity11 as he was seven decades ago , according to those close to the pair			1
and the besotted couple , who have neighbouring rooms in a care home , still hold hands every day			1
devoted : lord @entity9 and lady @entity11 pictured in 2008 , have been together for 72 years @entity9 , who celebrates his 90th birthday today , lives with @entity11 , 91 , in a specialist charity care home for elderly or sick entertainers in west @entity22			1
the director , who won eight @entity24 for his 1982 epic @entity26 , has been in a wheelchair since suffering a stroke five years ago			2
at a screening of @entity9 ’s 1993 movie shadowlands to commemorate the filmmaker ’s landmark birthday , his close friend and former colleague @entity29 said : ‘ i saw him just on friday , he ’s frail , he ’s very quiet now but he ’s lovely and he ’s in good hands			2
‘ he ’s being well looked after and he just holds @entity11 ’s hand and they ’re as much in love today as they were 72 years ago			1
i ’m happy to say he ’s really in good form			2
’ back in the days : @entity43 and in love , the couple are pictured in 1952 @entity9 met his actress wife when they were students at the prestigious @entity46 in @entity22 and co-starred in a play			1
they went on to have three children together			0
@entity50 , 63 , is a theatre director and @entity51 , 54 , became an actress			0
their elder daughter , @entity55 , and her daughter @entity56 died in the 2004 @entity58 tsunami			0
during the screening , which took place at the @entity62 headquarters in @entity22 , @entity50 said : ‘ my parents met 72 years ago and they ’re actually in a home now because they need a lot of nursing care , but they ’re in rooms next door to each other			1
‘ @entity70 ’s on her right hand side and @entity74 ’s brother ] is in a room on her left			0
so she ’s in the middle of her brother and her husband			0
i think it ’s a minor miracle to hold a marriage together for that length of time			0
‘ they met at @entity46 , and to hold a marriage together , in our business of all businesses			0
’ together forever : @entity9 and @entity11 live in neighboring rooms at a care home for entertainers @entity50 , who hosted a party at the weekend to celebrate both his father ’s 90th and his mother ’s 91st birthdays , added : ‘ it ’s horrid to see someone whose life was so much based around activity and around articulacy having lost the capacity to do both			1
‘ but it was still clear to me yesterday that he knew exactly what was happening and i told him that i was coming here and he was very touched that @entity62 was honouring his 90th birthday in such a way			0
’ also at the screening on tuesday was @entity112 , who wrote the screenplay for shadowlands and was behind the film adaptation of @entity116			0
he said : ‘ we do live in a world now where a lot of directors seem to think the way to create good film is through fear , through creating an atmosphere of great tension and i have experienced this myself			1
‘ and i just love it that [ @entity9 ] made his great films through the opposite method			1
this is not the @entity132 school of filmmaking , and thank @entity134 for that , because what a miserable world it would be if we had to endure that			0
