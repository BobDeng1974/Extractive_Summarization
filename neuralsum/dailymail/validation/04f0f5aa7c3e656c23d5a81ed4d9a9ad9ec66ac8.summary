at the time of @entity8 's arrest , @entity85 @entity39 attorney @entity84 said the suspect - who also provided allegedly falsified emails - was seeking a ' quick payday based on a blatant forgery			1

november 22 , 2003 - mr @entity10 to mr @entity8 ' i have recently met with a couple of upperclassmen here at @entity60 that are planning to launch a site very similar to ours			1
if we do n’t make a move soon , i think we will lose the advantage we would have if we release before them			0
' i ’ve stalled them for the time being and with a break if you could send another $ 1000 for the facebook ( sic ) project it would allow me to pay my roommate or @entity154 to help integrate the search code and get the site live before them			0
please give me a call so that we can talk more about this			0
' january 1 , 2004 - mr @entity10 to mr @entity8 ' i think it is unnecessary at this point , with all of the extra work i have done for you , to be held to the original completion date			1
i should not be penalized for delays that were out of my control , namely that there have been so many unspecified requests from the @entity170 project that you wanted to be placed as a priority , thereby delaying my start on our second project			0
' thus , i am requesting a written waiver on your part exempting me from the obligation to give you additional ownership in the project that is outlined in our original contract			0
' january 5 - mr @entity8 to mr @entity10 ' it is well past january 1 and to my knowledge you do n't have a single thing done for the site ... you know perfectly well that you ca n't just take a person 's investment and then spend it on women and beer or whatever you do up there in @entity60			1
' i 've been stalled long enough on this thing and if i do n't see something soon i 'll no choice but to contact the school and perhaps your parents in @entity201 and let them know what 's going on			0
' february 2 , 2004 - mr @entity10 to mr @entity8 ' @entity8 , i have a rather serious issue to discuss with you , according to our contract i owe you over 30 % more of the business in late penalties which would give you over 80 % of the company			1
' first i want to say that i think that is completely unfair because i did so much extra work for you on your site that caused those delays in the first place and second i do n’t even think it is legal to charge such a huge penalty			0
' mostly though i just wo n’t even bother putting the site live if you are going to insist on such a large percentage			0
i ’d like to suggest that you drop the penalty completely and that we officially return to 50/50 ownership			0
' february 6 , 2004 - mr @entity10 to mr @entity8 ' sorry it ’s taken me a few days to respond , ( sic ) now that the sites ( sic ) live i feel i must take creative control and i just can not risk injuring my sites ( sic ) reputation by cheapening it with your idea of selling college junk , nor do i wish to spend my time shipping out coffee mugs to rich alumni			1
the site is cool as it is and i do n’t care about making any money on it right now , i just want to see if people will use it			2
' february 7 , 2004 - mr @entity8 to mr @entity10 ' @entity10 , all i can think is your parents have handed you everything your entire life and after all this time and energy and money that you think in your head that an ok way to act is to just say - oh i ’ve changed my mind i do n’t think it ’s cool to make money and that that should be that			1
' april 6 , 2004 - mr @entity10 to mr @entity8 ' @entity8 , i have become too busy to deal with the site and no one wants to pay for it , so i am thinking of just taking the server down			2
my parents have a fund that i can tap into for my college expenses and i would just like to give you your two thousand dollars back and call it even on the rest of the money you owe me for the extra work			0
at this point i wo n’t even really be able to work on the facebook until @entity270			0
' april 6 , 2004 - mr @entity8 to mr @entity10 ' grow up , take a f * * * ing ethics class , choke yourself with that silver spoon of yours			2
' july 22 , 2004 - mr @entity10 to mr @entity8 ( a week before @entity3 was incorporated ) ' @entity8 , i am guessing that you do n’t want to talk to me but i wanted to say happy birthday and that i hope to resolve our differences			1
i see that what i did was wrong and i am really sorry that i behaved as i did			0
please give me your address and i will mail you back the $ 2000 for your trouble , more if it will repair our business relationship			0
' another summer is here and i still do n’t have any time to build our site , i understand that i promised i would , but other things have come up and i am out in @entity101 working during break			0
i just do n’t want the obligation of having to answer to you for not following through and i wo n’t be able to			0
