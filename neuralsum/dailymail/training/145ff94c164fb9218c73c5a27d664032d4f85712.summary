@entity0 business secretary @entity0 said his party should prepare for the apparently unthinkable prospect of @entity3 and the @entity4 in power @entity3 and the @entity7 may take the extraordinary step of entering a ‘ grand coalition ’ with each other after the next election , a senior cabinet minister has claimed			1
@entity0 business secretary @entity0 said his party should prepare for the apparently unthinkable prospect of @entity13 and @entity14 reaching some sort of power - sharing deal			1
‘ we may have to prepare ourselves for the possibility that we wo n't be in the coalition at all , that there will be a grand coalition between @entity3 and the @entity4 instead , ’ he said			1
asked if he expected that to happen , he said : ‘ it 's one of the possibilities we should be preparing for			0
’ mr @entity0 went on : ‘ it 's not something i 'm advocating , as it would put me out of a job			2
but we need to consider all of the possibilities			0
’ the business secretary ’s startling prediction came as he spoke to other guests after recording last week ’s @entity33 programme			1
in recent weeks , some political commentators have raised the possibility of a @entity3 - @entity4 alliance as polls suggest the two main parties are on the slide and both will struggle to command a @entity42 majority			1
conservative hopes of an outright win are threatened by the rise of @entity46 in @entity47 , while a dramatic advance by the @entity50 surge in @entity51 since last year ’s independence referendum is hampering @entity3 ’s chances			2
@entity54 , a former speechwriter for @entity13 , has speculated about a ‘ national government ’ bringing together the largest parties – a familiar arrangement in @entity58 , where it is called a ‘ grand coalition ’			1
‘ a government of national unity between @entity3 and the @entity7 may sound far - fetched , especially amid the froth and fury of a nascent election campaign , ’ he said			1
‘ it would certainly be tricky , exacerbating internal divisions and leading to more defections			0
' yet , while there are serious disagreements , the two parties have more in common with each other than with the insurgents on many key issues – especially if @entity13 survived and @entity14 was replaced by someone such as [ shadow business secretary ] @entity75			1
’ in the 1929 general election , @entity3 won 37 per cent of the vote and cobbled together a minority government led by @entity79 with @entity81 support			1
but when public spending had to be slashed to rein in a spiralling budget deficit following the @entity86 crash , the government fell apart			0
@entity79 , encouraged by @entity88 officials , formed a national government in 1931 , with the @entity7 joining a coalition			2
conservative and @entity3 strategists dismiss the prospect of a similar arrangement after may ’s election , despite the similar difficulties facing @entity97 as it tries to cut the vast debts run up in the 2009 financial crisis			2
@entity4 @entity13 and @entity3 leader @entity14 could be forced to enter a power - sharing deal if the election result is inconclusive , mr @entity0 suggested one senior @entity4 said mr @entity0 ’s predictions were ‘ absolutely absurd ’ and there was ‘ not a snowball ’s chance in @entity107 ’ of an arrangement with @entity3			1
labour leader mr @entity108 prompted speculation of a deal with the @entity50 over the weekend when he four times refused to rule out a coalition or looser arrangement with them			0
a deal with the @entity116 would most likely would be a ‘ supply and demand ’ arrangement , ensuring budgets and other key pieces of legislation were passed rather than a formal coalition			0
senior @entity51 mps are known to bitterly oppose the idea , but mr @entity14 repeatedly declined to rule it out in an appearance on the @entity128 on sunday			0
@entity50 @entity130 leader and general election campaign director @entity129 said : ‘ @entity14 refused to rule out working with the @entity50 following the general election , leaving the door open to the benefits of the @entity50 holding the balance of power in a hung @entity130 parliament with a minority @entity3 government			2
‘ left to their own devices , @entity3 would continue with austerity			2
with a strong group of @entity50 mps holding the balance of power at @entity130 , we can ensure that @entity51 ’s voice is heard and use our influence positively to end austerity economics , free @entity51 of @entity149 nuclear weapons , and secure the powers we need to build a fairer , more prosperous country			0
’ @entity51 conservative leader @entity152 said : “ with every week that passes , we hear more evidence @entity3 and the @entity50 are preparing to jump into bed with each other after may			0
‘ @entity14 and @entity157 are already halfway down the aisle			0
‘ a weak prime minister @entity14 with @entity159 pulling the strings in @entity130 should scare anyone committed to keeping the @entity97 together , as we can only imagine the concessions the @entity50 would wring from a @entity3 desperate for the keys to @entity164			0

business secretary says country must prepare for the unthinkable
@entity0 must not expect to *necessarily* be in government after election
there could be a ' grand coalition ' between @entity3 and the @entity4 instead
