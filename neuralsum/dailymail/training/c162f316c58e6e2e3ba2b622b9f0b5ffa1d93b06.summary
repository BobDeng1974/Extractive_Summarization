by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 06:55 est , 13 january 2014 @entity2 topped a list of ' traitors ' who @entity5 's staff believed betrayed her during her bitter 2008 presidential primary battle with @entity8 , a new book has revealed			1
the detailed list , which also included @entity13 heavyweight @entity12 , who died in 2009 , was kept by @entity15 's aides who ranked names on a seven - point scale , it is claimed			1
@entity2 , who was @entity18 for @entity19 at the time and went on to replace @entity15 as secretary of state in the @entity8 administration , was among those receiving the worst possible score , according to the book			1
compiled blacklist : @entity13 presidential hopeful senator @entity5 , addressing supporters during a @entity28 and @entity29 primary night event in 2008 on the campaign trail : then @entity13 presidential hopeful senator @entity8 was endorsed by former presidential candidate @entity2 at this rally in january 2008 @entity32 : @entity33 of @entity5 was written by political journalists @entity34 , from @entity36 , and @entity37 , from @entity38			2
they claimed that also on the political hit - list were senators @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 as well as @entity46 members @entity44 , @entity47 and @entity48			1
@entity34 and @entity37 write that year later @entity15 aides ' would joke about the fates of folks who they felt had betrayed them			0
" @entity53 : investigated ; @entity54 : disgraced by scandal ; @entity58 : stepped down , " one said to another			0
" @entity12 , " the aide continued , lowering his voice to a whisper for the punch line , " dead "			0
' @entity2 was the @entity13 's standard - bearer in the 2004 presidential election and president @entity15 had campaigned hard for him in the final stretch of that campaign , even though he was recovering from major heart surgery at the time			1
in 2008 , however , @entity2 did not merely endorse @entity8 ; he did so at a very vulnerable time for the then - senator from @entity70			2
having won the first - in - the - nation @entity72 caucuses , @entity8 then lost the @entity75 primary to @entity15 despite holding a large lead in almost all opinion polls			2
@entity5 's aides kept a detailed blacklist of ' traitors ' during the 2008 primary campaign two days later , @entity2 appeared at a rally with @entity8 in @entity82			1
' who better than @entity8 to turn a new page in @entity86 politics so that @entity13 , independents and @entity88 alike can look to the leadership that unites to find common ground ? ' he said			0
the reference to a ' new page ' was most obviously a criticism of the administration of president @entity95 , who had vanquished @entity2 in 2004			0
also on the list : senator @entity12 speaks after a tribute to him at the @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity101 @entity2 , pictured here arriving in @entity102 yesterday , is now @entity86 secretary of state , having replaced @entity5 but it was also seen by some as a jab at the @entity105 , whom the @entity8 campaign was trying to paint as synonymous with politics as usual , @entity36 reported			1
@entity43 endorsed @entity8 approximately one week later			0
@entity41 would do so at the end of february and @entity42 at the end of march			0
@entity42 's endorsement came amid a full - court press from the @entity15 campaign to win the april primary in his state of @entity116 by a convincing margin			1
they accomplished that goal , but it was not enough to halt @entity8 's momentum on his way to the nomination			0
@entity32 will be published by @entity124 on february 11			0
it will tell the inside story of @entity15 's relationship with @entity8 , and of how she recovered after the bruising 2008 campaign and restored her political standing .			2

it was kept by @entity15 's aides who ranked names on a seven - point scale
among the others were @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43
