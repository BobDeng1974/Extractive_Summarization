@entity0 played as a deep - lying midfielder , but it did n’t feel like a midfielder ’s performance			1
he was embarrassed by @entity5 for their goal , and he was lucky to get away with losing his man at the previous set - piece			0
when @entity10 were in possession , he did n’t work hard enough to get on the ball — he was happy to let @entity13 bring the ball out			2
@entity15 defender @entity0 failed to impress after being handed a midfield role @entity0 ( right ) returns to the centre circle after playing a part in conceding @entity20 's opening goal @entity22 's ' experiment ' of playing @entity0 as a deep central midfielder did n't pay dividends read @entity26 's full match report from the @entity27 out of possession , he often flew out in an attempt to deal with the danger			1
this is fine when he wins the ball , but a very risky tactic			0
in fairness , he dropped back nicely in between the centre halves regularly , which is clearly what he feels comfortable doing			0
the main problem is that he has a habit of chasing the ball when he ca n’t win it			0
he looks like he ’s been fired out of a cannon ! he ’ll need to assess situations better and hold his position in front of the back four			0
sir @entity46 famously labelled @entity0 the next @entity47 , but he did n’t look very @entity47 - like			1
at 23 , it feels like we ’re still trying to figure out his best position			0
he is being asked to play a role that needs to be filled by a more technically - proficient player — like @entity53			2
@entity54 looked excellent against @entity20 , like the elder statesman leading his younger team - mates			1
he does everything with intelligence and showed his quality with 30 - yard diagonal balls and a fine effort against the crossbar			0
@entity54 stepped to the fore in his role as captain and was unlucky not to score in @entity66 @entity10 captain showed a good understanding with @entity69 on their first start together he also linked up really well with @entity69 , especially in the second half			1
it looked like they had a kind of telepathic togetherness			0
i ’m sure that will be something @entity22 will be keen to see more of in the future			2
it ’s interesting how , recently , strike partnerships have seemed like a thing of the past , but @entity54 and @entity69 demonstrated they have an excellent understanding and play like a pair , not individuals			1
@entity87 shows why he 's still valuable to @entity22 when you look at @entity87 ’s rise in international football , it has been completely without fanfare			1
he had a couple of hairy moments , but still looked the best defender on show in @entity66 , weighing in with countless clearances and blocks			2
he also reads the game very well			0
@entity100 centre - back @entity87 proved he is @entity10 's best defender with a fuss - free performance @entity87 fared better than fellow defender @entity13 who was forced to withdraw after feeling unwell he was relegated to the @entity102 with @entity103 in 2007 and bought by @entity100 , where he took a while to mature			1
but right now , he looks better than @entity13 and @entity0 , who have had a lot more hype surrounding their breakthroughs into the @entity10 squad			1
@entity87 was left out against @entity110 , but showed he should still be first - choice			2
substitute @entity111 rescued @entity10 with a late super strike to earn a draw			0

@entity10 drew 1 - 1 with @entity20 in their international *friendly* in @entity66
@entity15 's @entity0 failed to impress in a deep midfield role
@entity54 developed a good understanding with @entity69
@entity100 's @entity87 proved he is @entity22 's best defender
read : @entity69 shows he can handle the heat as @entity20 provide stern test
