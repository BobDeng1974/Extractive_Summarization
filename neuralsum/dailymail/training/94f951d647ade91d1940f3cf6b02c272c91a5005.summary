yet @entity3 nun @entity1 still found herself facing deportation back home when her application for a new resident permit was turned down			2
despite protestations and a huge public outcry , the 63 - year - old was about to board a plane yesterday that would have taken her away from a life treating the sick and needy in @entity20			1
it was only then - amid warnings that the ‘ heart ’ would be ‘ ripped out ’ of the catholic mission where she served - that the @entity4 government carried out a u-turn			1
she has now been given a last - minute temporary reprieve to stay on in the country while her visa problems are sorted out			2
the country ’s home secretary @entity32 said this means ‘ @entity37 ’ should be able to stay ‘ without limit of time ’ ‘ i am overjoyed and very confident that i would live here forever , ’ the @entity39 - raised @entity2 nun said yesterday			1
‘ i love the people here and have a strong sense of attachment to this place			1
‘ it feels great to be with my well - wishers , my own kith and kin , mostly those inflicted with leprosy			1

belonging to the @entity65 , a congregation of the @entity66 founded in @entity67 in the 18th century , she came from @entity68 as part of a batch of nurses and medics to the @entity73 in @entity20			1
she chose never to go back , and her work in the last 29 years means she is now called @entity75 ’s ‘ @entity6 ’			1
sister @entity37 said she was n’t given any reason by authorities for being kicked out and was simply told to leave the country by 25th july			0
caring : at the mission ' @entity37 ' has helped treat thousands of people some critics fear that @entity4 authorities do not like attention being drawn to a debilitating disease that they officially claim to have eradicated			2
when she first arrived she had n’t need any visa as at that time citizens of @entity88 countries could travel to each other ’s country without @entity91			0

’ before yesterday ’s official u-turn , the @entity73 ’s director , father @entity97 , said : ‘ we do n’t have anybody to take care of our clinics who is as trained and committed as sister @entity37			1
‘ she ’s wonderful – she knows every leprosy patient by name , even though @entity4 names are difficult			2

leprosy patients are often pushed outside city limits and many also face lifelong rejection and discrimination			0
due to lack of awareness in @entity4 society , there remains a widespread fear that the disease is highly contagious			0
sister @entity37 said that she only visits home occasionally now , to see her fellow nuns or her brother back in @entity39			0
they will have to wait a little longer before they next see her , and the @entity75 wore a festive look yesterday at the news			0
