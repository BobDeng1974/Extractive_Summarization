social media should be monitored by police and security services , a former intelligence chief has said , to prevent paedophiles and terrorists from communicating unhindered			1
sir @entity6 , former permanent secretary and @entity8 in the @entity9 , says criminals are increasingly making use of online social networks such as @entity13 and @entity14 to communicate			1
he added that those responsible for protecting society need to use the technology to keep suspects under surveillance			0
challenge : sir @entity6 says that without the monitoring and collection of social media intelligence the sites could become ' secret spaces ' where those carrying out illegal activities could communicate unhindered he said that without the monitoring and collection of social media intelligence , known as @entity31 , websites could become ‘ secret spaces ’ where those carrying out illegal activities could communicate freely			1
however , the former @entity35 intelligence officer made it clear that an individual ’s account should only be ‘ hacked ’ into under certain circumstances			2
the soon to be published @entity40 is expected to force internet service providers to store details of when and where emails are sent and by whom			0
mr @entity6 wants a @entity46 to be published on monitoring social media sites and for private industry to link up with the government to develop analytical tools to monitor developments			1
there have been reports to suggest that @entity55 pirates in the @entity56 are using social media to communicate with one another and mr @entity6 said that in such circumstances the authorities need to be able to gain access to private accounts			1
monitoring : mr @entity6 said criminals are increasingly making use of online social networks such as @entity13 and @entity14 to communicate he added : ‘ i do n’t know anybody who thinks that it should be ring - fenced and allowed to become a secret space			2
’ a new report by the think - tank @entity70 indicates that @entity13 and @entity14 accounts could be legally accessed by using the @entity73 and @entity74 ( @entity75 )			0
the act states that warrants are not necessary for ‘ directed surveillance ’ of a suspect – for example when monitoring a person ’s movements – and that the principle could be extended to the internet where investigators were using publicly available information			0
however , the former director of @entity88 said it was essential that monitoring was put on a legal footing so that where individuals have put up privacy settings on their social network accounts any monitoring which involves the interception of communications should require a warrant			1
networking : mr @entity6 wants a @entity46 to be published on monitoring social media sites and for private industry to link up with the public sector to develop analytical surveillance tools the report states : ‘ @entity114 legitimacy demands that where new methods of intelligence gathering and use are to be introduced , they should be on a firm legal basis and rest on parliamentary and public understanding of what is involved , even if the operational details of the sources and methods used must sometimes remain secret			1
‘ people now share vastly more personal information about themselves , their friends and their networks in new a varied ways : what is ‘ public ’ and what is ‘ private ’ is not always obvious and differs greatly across social media platforms and even within social media platforms			2

‘ after @entity149 , we must be sure that if people are engaged in this kind of monitoring , they are doing it for the reasons set out in the authorisation ( and that ) it has not been politicised			0
’ a @entity158 spokesman said communications data has played a role in every major security service counter-terrorism operation over the past decade and in 95 per cent of all serious organised crime investigations			0
however , @entity163 says that when it comes to accessing pornography online laws will not protect children - only parents can keep their children safe from such adult material .			0

existing laws regulating interception of communications by police and intelligence agencies need overhaul
public need to be *confident* they are not being *abused*
