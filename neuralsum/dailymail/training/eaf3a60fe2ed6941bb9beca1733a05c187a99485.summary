by @entity0 from ski slopes to bike trails , tiny cameras such as @entity2 , seem to be everywhere			0
but far from showing an exhilarating experience , their shaky footage can sometimes prove to be nauseating			0
now computer scientists believe they have come up with a solution : a ' hyperlapse ' that provide a smooth ride through the landscape no matter how jerky the original footage			1
their software creates a 3d map of the original footage , and then recreates the shots on what they describe as a ' novel camera path '			1
this novel camera path is found by analysing each frame of the video for ones that link together smoothly			2
the algorithm then connects these ' smooth points ' and generates a time - lapsed video within those frames			1
the software creates a 3d map of the original footage shot on the video			1
next , it analyses each frame of the video for ones that link together smoothly			1
it then connects these ' smooth points ' together , and generates a time - lapsed video within those frame the result is a smooth , jerk - free video that does n't make you want to vomit			1
the @entity59 - based team have released two videos to show exactly how it works , with raw footage played alongside the time lapsed version			2
the project is due to be part of @entity67 2014 , a @entity64 conference later this month held to showcase computer graphics techniques			0
the system is currently a research project and there are no existing plans to commercialise the software			0
the group is also working on making the @entity76 algorithm work as a @entity78 app , but they said it will likely be some time until that happens			1
if you 've ever wanted to recreate a cinema in your living room , or turn your bedroom into a karaoke bar , @entity26 has the answer			2
its @entity89 prototype beams screens from a computer on to the walls of a room , including browser tabs , maps , documents , videos and photos			0
the system uses small projectors and sensors to scan the layout of a room , including furniture , objects and people , to make sure the web pages are n't distorted			0
it also uses a @entity110 camera to map mouse clicks to hand gestures			0
this means users can hold their hand over the position of a link on the wall and if they mimic pushing it , the @entity89 system recognises it as mouse click			0
examples given by @entity26 include videos being projected from a pc onto a large wall , karaoke lyrics displayed above a music video playing on a tv screen , or a photo of a window being used in place of a wall .			2
