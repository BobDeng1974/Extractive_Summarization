@entity1 managers are hindering young @entity4 players ' international careers by not supporting them playing for the @entity5 , according to former @entity4 striker @entity6			1
the @entity5 secured a place at next year 's @entity8 on tuesday with a 4 - 2 aggregate win over @entity10 and it has been suggested @entity4 should follow the lead of @entity12 and @entity13 by fielding more established players at the finals			1
@entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 would all be eligible to play for the @entity5 in the @entity21 next june but club bosses remain unconvinced			1
full internationals @entity17 ( left ) and @entity19 could play for the @entity5 next year @entity16 has 24 senior caps but would also be eligible to play in the @entity21 next summer @entity27 's @entity26 and @entity29 's @entity28 have both voiced concerns about the potential for fatigue and former @entity4 striker @entity6 expressed his disappointment at the duo 's stance			1
' wo n't happen , but i wish @entity39 managers would support their young players ' international careers , not hinder them			2
' @entity6 tweeted , adding a link to @entity26 and @entity28 's comments			1
' all our star under 21 players should go to the finals next summer if fit			1
other countries insist on it			0
' i get managers me , me , me attitude , but would n't it be refreshing if , for once , they thought about the good of the national game ? ' @entity56 ( centre ) had plenty to say on @entity59 about how players should come back to the @entity5 21s @entity6 was on @entity59 on thursday saying ' all our star under 21 players should go to the finals if fit ' @entity12 won the @entity8 in 2009 , thrashing @entity4 4 - 0 in the final			1
five players who started that match - @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 - were also part of the @entity73 side that beat @entity74 1 - 0 in the @entity76 final earlier this year			0
@entity29 boss @entity28 , however , believes parachuting senior players into the junior ranks is not the answer , insisting @entity29 midfielder @entity20 will need a rest at the end of the campaign			0
@entity6 , pictured playing against @entity84 at the 1986 @entity76 , scored 48 goals in 80 games for @entity4 @entity87 could have as many as eight extra players available to select for the @entity89 next year : @entity19 , @entity90 @entity16 , @entity27 @entity17 , @entity27 @entity18 , @entity27 @entity91 , @entity92 @entity93 , @entity92 @entity94 , @entity29 @entity20 , @entity29 ' if the tournament was now , it would be a good opportunity for @entity20 to get some playing time but if it is at the end of a season where he has played consistently for 10 months then he needs to have a break , ' @entity28 said			1
'' we keep talking about players who need to make tournaments but i think we need to start creating a way of playing and that way of playing will demand one player or another			0
' it is not because bringing so many good names together will give you a chance of being successful			0
' what would be the under - 21s ' objective - ( is it ) to get players into the senior side ? because if players are already in the senior side what would be the motivation for a player to go into the under - 21s ? ' will @entity125 ( centre ) was on target as the @entity128 beat @entity10 4 - 2 on aggregate to qualify @entity28 ( left ) and @entity26 voiced concerns about fatigue in their younger players ' sometimes we speak too much about individual names			2
you need to look into it on an individual case ; players who have played too much football , the needs of the team more importantly			0
' @entity26 , who is in charge of a number of young @entity4 starlets at @entity27 , is also sceptical			0
' once a guy has moved up to the full national team , ( if ) you put him down ( to the under - 21s ) he is never good , ' @entity26 said			2
' apart from on the selfish front for us when a guy has played 50 games , it is better that a guy has a good rest during the summer			2
' but most of the time , when they move down , they are not completely at their quality			0
' @entity160 rest row rumbles on			0

@entity162 could call on full internationals for next summer 's @entity8 finals
