by @entity0 @entity3 's @entity2 team has hit back at reports co-host @entity5 was in the firing line to get axed from the show			1
a story which ran in the @entity9 and was then repeated again on @entity11 's @entity10 suggested the presenter was about to get the boot in a line up change back in 2011			1
however the story was rubbished by the @entity2 breakfast team on tuesday as a ' big steaming pile of poo			1
he advised getting rid of ' @entity5 ' and said reinvigorating the morning line up would potentially help ratings			1
after the story ran on @entity10 on monday night , @entity5 , 58 , was barraged by worried viewers , thinking he was about to get the boot from @entity2			1
@entity36 comments : @entity5 's use of the word ' sane ' when trying to defend himself was seen by some viewers as a dig at @entity29 's mental health issues he addressed the rumours on the breakfast show on tuesday saying : ' well no. that ( the email ) was in 2011 from a bloke who had moved on and saner heads prevailed			1
' @entity48 added : ' of course they were sane , ' with the team laughing in unison			0
co-host @entity52 then got involved in the conversation saying : ' brilliant minds stepped in			0
' @entity5 said : ' he was n't looking at anything because [ @entity29 ] was n't in charge of this show at the time			1
' he was simply sending an email with his thoughts			0
thoughts that were rejected by those actually running the joint			0
' but not all of the @entity2 team seemed to be happy to take the story so calmly , with his co hosts appearing exasperated			1
on the defence : the @entity2 team laughed at the story of line up changes , with @entity48 saying it was a ' pile of poo ' @entity74 , 36 , who replaced @entity76 , 44 , earlier this year , rolled her eyes saying : ' i can not believe that we have given this ( claim ) more airtime			1
it 's such a big steaming pile of poo			1
' however @entity5 's remarks were taken by some as a dig at @entity29 's issues with mental illness - he has struggled with bi-polar for a number of years			1
the presenter used the word ' sane ' and was seen to be mocking the former @entity2 executive producer			2
he took to twitter to defend himself saying : ' in defending the @entity10 story i innocently used a common turn of phrase which has caused offense to some			1
that was n't my intension			0
' @entity74 also posted an apology saying : apologies to all about this morning 's poor choice of words			2
i would never make light of it			0
' the @entity9 initally ran the story regarding @entity29 on monday - saying it had been given access to an email sent from @entity29 to @entity3 's then head of news and current ­ affairs , @entity115 , and chief executive @entity112 , with a couple of other executives			1
he outlined his ideas to reinvigorate the show saying : ' @entity121 and @entity122 are already gone and we ’re on the verge of losing @entity125			0

' he said : ' it is my view the hosts should be @entity147 and @entity148			0
i think @entity148 has ­ proven her star ability on @entity150 ( @entity151 )			0
it ’s unfair to judge her alongside @entity5			2
' @entity5 could arrange a breakfast radio shift for next year if we give him enough notice			2
' the story broke on the same day @entity157 ran its @entity9 story profile on @entity29 - where he revealed he had considered committing suicide due to his mental illness issues			1

@entity29 revealed he briefly contemplated suicide while in his apartment : ' i walked around the bedroom and i looked at the balcony and i thought : " yeah , you know , here 's a way			1
" ' instead he woke his partner @entity192 and told him he needed to go to hospital			0
following the breakdown @entity29 started taking medication for his illness and returned to work , but by january this year he decided he could not go on			2
he told @entity9 story : ' it finally struck me , i was n't trapped by @entity3 , i was trapped by television			1
