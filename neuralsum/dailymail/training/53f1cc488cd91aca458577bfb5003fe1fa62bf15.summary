after building the slippery creation , @entity0 filmed the ride with a @entity4 camera			1
the documented ride shows he and friends sliding through various obstacles , up walls , and dropping off into a river			0
at one point , @entity0 's dog even decides to take a turn at the lengthy slide			2
after sufficiently going down the slide a few times and ending up with a few bumps and bruises , @entity0 tells his @entity56 audience of over 100,000 how he built the slide and what materials he used to create it			2
@entity0 makes a splash without getting his @entity4 camera too wet one of @entity0 's friends does n't quite make it into the water off the slide @entity0 continued to wet the slide so that he and his friends would n't get too hurt the slide even goes uphill as shown in this photo of the elaborate creation @entity0 is having fun on his slide but tells fans to proceed with caution if they want to make the obstacle on their own after documenting his slippery journey @entity0 tells his @entity56 fans exactly how he built the slip n ' slide most of the materials @entity0 used were free cardboard and wood from a local warehouse @entity85 reports that the only supply @entity0 bought for the contraption was one 100 foot roll of plastic			1
he was able to get cardboard palettes and other items for free from warehouses that were giving them away			0
@entity0 also got some help from his mom who gave him rakes , shuttles , and a large plot of her land			0
even though @entity0 had a fun building his projects he says that others should proceed with caution			2
' obviously , it 's at your own risk , ' @entity0 says			0
' i do n't take any responsibly for your stupidity			0
' if people decide to be ' stupid ' he says that they can dig a deep v in the ground where they can place cardboard to stabilize the slide and give the slider speed			0
