the @entity0 are planning to repeat the ' labour tax bombshell ' campaign that won them the 1992 general election			1
@entity5 will argue @entity6 has £ 15billion of unexplained tax cuts , having voted to back @entity8 plans to save £ 30billion over five years			1
yesterday , the prime minister torpedoed @entity6 's central economic attack by categorically ruling out a rise in @entity12			1
asked by @entity13 at the final prime minister 's questions before polling day whether he would rule out a rise in @entity12 , he replied : ' the answer is yes			1
' the announcement left mr @entity13 , who appeared unprepared for the ' straight answer ' he had demanded , floundering			1
it has already drawn up billboards featuring a swinging block of concrete in the shape of the letters vat			0
mr @entity5 then challenged mr @entity13 to rule out the prospect of @entity6 raising national insurance contributions , which it did in 2002			1
the @entity6 leader repeatedly declined to do so , saying the @entity0 would have ' plenty of time to ask questions ' after polling day on may 7			2
however , within two hours of @entity43 finishing , shadow chancellor @entity41 issued a different message			0
' we will make it clear in the manifesto @entity6 will not be raising national insurance			0
that will be a clear pledge from us , ' mr @entity41 said			0
later he ruled out any increase in either the basic or higher rate of income tax			0
' we have clear pledges			0
no rise in @entity12 under @entity6 , no rise in the basic and higher rates of income tax under @entity6 , no rise in national insurance under @entity6 , ' mr @entity41 said			2
' our plans add up , theirs do n't			0
as night follows day , if people vote @entity22 vat will go up			0
it always does and it will again			0
' conservative sources suggested the party had set a trap for mr @entity13 because chancellor @entity70 had repeatedly refused to rule out a rise in @entity12 under questioning from @entity21			2
' @entity6 has been panicked today into ruling out tax rises left , right and centre , ' said a senior official			1
' so where is the £ 15billion tax bombshell going to fall ? it is a safe bet that this is going to feature heavily in our campaign			1
' conservative sources said the party had set a trap for mr @entity13 because chancellor @entity70 two days ago ( pictured ) declined to give a ' cast - iron guarantee ' to match @entity6 's pledge not to increase vat in an echo of slogans in the 1992 election campaign , when @entity89 defied the polls to win a majority , mr @entity5 said : ' we know there is a tax bombshell coming from @entity6 … it would wreck our economy			1
' the issue is likely to figure in the first leaders ' tv interviews of the election campaign tonight , when mr @entity5 and mr @entity13 face a grilling from @entity102 and @entity103 on @entity104 and @entity105			1
the @entity0 have claimed they do not intend to raise any taxes , instead saving £ 13billion from the budgets of @entity8 departments , £ 12billion from cutting the benefits bill and £ 5billion from measures to squeeze tax avoidance			2
however , they have to find £ 7billion to fund two tax pledges by the end of the next parliament – an increase in the personal allowance for income tax to £ 12,500 and the threshold for the 40p rate rising to £ 50,000			2
the announcements from the conservatives and @entity6 severely restrict the room for manoeuvre of both on taxation after the next election because vat and national insurance raise huge amounts for the @entity130			2
raising significant sums elsewhere might require new taxes on businesses			0
mr @entity13 insisted ' nobody would believe ' mr @entity5 's pledge and @entity6 officials said the party would press ahead with its billboard campaign			1
they pointed out that mr @entity5 had said before the last election that he had ' no plans ' to raise vat			1
mr @entity70 raised vat from 17.5 to 20 per cent in his emergency budget in june 2010			0
@entity6 said the @entity0 had made a similar pledge before the 1992 election , only to break it a year later			1
last night , mr @entity5 was cheered as he addressed the last meeting of the backbench 1922 committee of this parliament			2
' we 've got the song , we 've got the tune , we 've got the lines , we 've got the policies , ' the prime minister said			0
' so let 's get out there and sing about it			0
let 's get out there and win			0

@entity5 will argue @entity6 has £ 15billion of unexplained tax cuts
the prime minister *torpeoded* a @entity6 attack by ruling out vat increase
