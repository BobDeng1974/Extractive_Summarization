@entity0 is to show its users adverts for the first time this weekend			1
despite not having a regular source of revenue , @entity0 was recently valued in the region of $ 10 billion ( £ 6 billion )			1
co-founder @entity7 revealed the plans to show adverts on the app last week - but the firm has so far refused to say who the first buyer is			1
' this weekend we ’re placing an advertisement in “ @entity17 ” for @entity18 in the @entity19 , ' the firm said			0
sponsored posts will only show up on the app 's stories feature			1

' it ’s the first time we ’ve done anything like this because it ’s the first time we ’ve been paid to put content in that space			0
' it ’s going to feel a little weird at first , but we ’re taking the plunge			0
' the firms 24 - year - old co-founder @entity43 told @entity46 's @entity45 that sponsored posts will only show up on the app 's stories feature			1

mr @entity7 said : ' people are going to see the first ads on @entity0 soon			1
we think they 're pretty cool			0
' he added that the adverts will be opt - in , and users can choose to look at them , or skip			2
' the best advertisements tell you more about stuff that actually interests you , ' the firm promised today			0
' an advertisement will appear in your recent updates from time to time , and you can choose if you want to watch it			0
it goes away after you view it or within 24 hours , just like stories			0
' the firm also admits exactly why it is introducing the feature			0
' the answer is probably unsurprising – we need to make money			0
' advertising allows us to support our service while delivering neat content to @entity18			0
' we promise that we ’ll use the money we make to continue to surprise the @entity0 community with more terrific products – that ’s what we love to do ! ' it also pledged it will never put ads in personal communications			2
' that would be totally rude			0
we want to see if we can deliver an experience that ’s fun and informative , the way ads used to be , before they got creepy and targeted			0
' earlier this week , reports claimed @entity95 was reportedly preparing to invest £ 12 million ( $ 20 million ) in @entity0			1
despite not yet having a source of revenue , more than 100 million users use the app - which is apparently enough to convince companies to spend vast sums on the three - year old startup			1
@entity95 ’s move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm @entity105 and @entity106 in august			0
@entity107 has used targeted advertising for years , and its @entity110 app began rolling out sponsored posts ( pictured left ) to the @entity19 , @entity113 and the @entity114 from june			1
@entity107 also recently released ' local awareness ' ads that help local business promote themselves to users ( pictured right ) earlier this week , reports said @entity122 - based @entity95 ( ceo @entity121 shown making her keynote address in january 2014 ) is planning to invest £ 12 million ( $ 20 million ) in the three year - old tech startup			1
if true the investment would value the company at £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) the move comes after a similar , albeit much larger , investment in @entity129 technology firm @entity127 reaped huge dividends for @entity95 , with its $ 1 billion investment in 40 per cent of the company in 2005 now valued at tens of billions of dollars			1
this latest move , according to the @entity133 , comes as @entity0 starts to seek funding from venture - capital firms , money managers and companies			1
earlier this year @entity110 launched a new ephemeral messaging app called @entity140			1
the app , which functions in a similar way to @entity0 , allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend			2
like @entity0 , the user can tap on a friend 's face to instantly send a photo , or hold their finger down to send a video			1
however , @entity140 only allows you to send messages to one person at a time , which makes it frustrating if you ’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends			0
the favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends , though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total			0
@entity140 is currently only available in @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 ahead of a planned release in the rest of the world			0
snapchat may be a key partner to @entity95 as it gets set to release @entity177 next year			2
this is a rumoured service that will display brief ads alongside news and video clips on the app , which will likely become a key source of revenue for @entity0			1
@entity177 would provide a platform for @entity95 to distribute its own content			2
however , the £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) valuation of a company that has n't , yet , monetised its users , has been dubbed a risky proposition			1
that ’s not to say it has n’t worked before ; @entity194 ’s 2007 investment in @entity107 valued the then three - year old company at £ 9.4 billion ( $ 15 billion ) , and later proved hugely successful			1
last year @entity0 infamously turned down a £ 1.8 billion ( $ 3 billion ) offer from @entity107 - a decision that left many stunned			1
but the move seems to have paid off , as @entity0 ’s owners @entity7 and @entity200 are set to become billionaires according to the current valuations of the company			1
if the valuation holds true , @entity0 would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) or more , including car - ride service uber and rooms - to - let startup @entity210			1
@entity95 's move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm @entity105 and @entity106 in august this year			2
pictured are owners @entity7 , left , and @entity200 @entity0 lets users send photo - messages that vanish within seconds , but is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services			1
this may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users			0
although @entity0 , and other similar mobile messaging apps , do n't have established business models yet , its rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so			1
@entity0 is continuing to grow in popularity , with people sending more than 700 million disappearing messages a day			2
in june , @entity107 launched a similar app called @entity234 in the hope of replicating @entity0 ’s success			2
the app lets consumers exchange photos and videos , which later disappear , without requiring @entity107 accounts			0
but despite its rapid growth , @entity0 has had a number of obstacles to contend with			2
the group this year settled charges with @entity19 regulators , which accused it of deceiving consumers by promising that photos sent on its service disappeared forever after a period of time			2
according to the @entity257 at the time , photos sent on @entity0 could , in fact , be saved by recipients using several methods , such as taking a screenshot .			2

@entity0 's @entity7 said sponsored posts will appear on the app
firm refuses to reveal who first advertiser is
the ephemeral messaging app was recently valued at $ 10 billion ( £ 6 billion )
other rumours *suggest* @entity0 will soon introduce news to the service
this could include @entity177 next year - a service that will display brief adverts alongside news and video clips on the app
