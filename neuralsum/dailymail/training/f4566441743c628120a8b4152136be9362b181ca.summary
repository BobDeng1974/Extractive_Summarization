@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we learned from the @entity4 and @entity5 this week , including how one @entity6 is consigning another to distant memory at the @entity8			0
click here to follow @ ralphellis56 1 ) @entity10 , once the biggest and most controversial name at @entity12 , continues to be pushed deeper into the club ’s history books by the goal scoring of fellow @entity6 @entity16			1
@entity17 highlighted the fact that @entity16 ’s goal at @entity20 – his 57th in the @entity4 since arriving in @entity21 – made him at 114 minutes per strike the most frequent scorer in the @entity4 ’s history			2
it also brought him to within two of the 59 struck for @entity12 by @entity10 – at an average of 140 minutes wait per goal			1
@entity16 celebrates after scoring in @entity12 's 2 - 0 win over @entity20 2 ) @entity29 can join the @entity31 squad this week knowing he ’s beaten the persistent groin injury problems which he suffered during the second part of last season			1
he finished @entity36 ’s 1 - 0 defeat at @entity37 as one of only nine @entity4 outfield players to have played every minute in every competition for their club so far			2
the 23 - year - old has not played so many matches in a row for nearly 18 months			0
@entity45 has overcome injury problems to be an ever present for @entity36 this season 3 ) @entity48 might be a tad too nice for the @entity4 – @entity51 ’s booking near the end of the 2 - 0 defeat at @entity54 was only the ninth collected in all competitions by @entity58 ’s side this season			1
that ’s the lowest total of any top flight club – leaders @entity62 are far from having the worst disciplinary record , but the four yellow cards in their win over @entity67 took them to 20 in all competitions			0
@entity51 ( @entity69 ) picked up a booking against @entity54 but @entity48 have been far too timid this season 4 ) @entity71 tried to get rid of @entity72 this summer but literally could n’t give him away after the @entity74 winger , troubled by hamstring injuries and poor form , had played just 34 minutes of @entity4 football all last season			1
the @entity80 boss might just end up being glad of that after the performance the 25 - year - old gave at @entity84 in his first top flight start of this campaign			2
the former @entity88 player , who has two seasons left on the five - year contract he signed at @entity91 in 2011 , set up one goal and made two more chances with a bright right wing display			1
@entity72 ( @entity69 ) surprised @entity91 fans with an adventurous performance against @entity84 5 ) @entity97 was n’t the most glamorous of @entity99 ’s summer signings , but the @entity101 full back is blossoming as one of @entity104 ’s best bits of talent spotting			1
the 20 - year - old , who cost £ 2.85million after playing only 36 games for @entity108 , set up one goal and made three more chances with his crossing in the 2 - 0 win over @entity112			0
he can defend too – winning 100 per cent of his tackles and condemning @entity114 to an afternoon where he gave the ball away 31 times			0
@entity104 completed an astute piece of business by signing @entity97 for @entity99 6 ) @entity120 will be hoping that @entity122 owner @entity121 is too wrapped up this week following the town ’s @entity124 club to saturday ’s @entity126 against @entity127 to notice how badly his side are performing			1
the @entity129 , touted as the next big thing when he took the @entity132 into the play - offs last season , has collected only ten points from the first quarter of the season despite signing 11 new players in the summer			0
@entity122 had taken 14 points from their previous 11 games when @entity121 sacked his predecessor @entity141 last december 7 ) @entity143 midfielder @entity142 fell out with new boss @entity144 last january having tried , and failed , to force through a move to @entity146			1
he started only six matches for the rest of the season , and his future looked far from certain until the 31 - year - old former @entity152 and @entity153 star agreed to let bygones be bygones			0
@entity156 boss @entity144 has seen @entity142 come tio life since making up with the midfielder both club and player have reaped rewards from making up			1
@entity142 has not missed a game this term , and was outstanding for the @entity163 as they battled to a goalless draw away to promotion favourites @entity165			2
8 ) former @entity88 and @entity54 goalkeeper @entity166 is finding his feet again in @entity21 football after four years playing in @entity169 and then @entity170			2
the 37 - year - old starred in a 1 - 0 win over @entity173 that lifted his new club @entity174 to just a point off the @entity177 play - off places			0
former @entity88 keeper @entity166 ( @entity178 ) has been starring for @entity174 @entity166 , likely to take his total of @entity181 caps to 37 in next week ’s two @entity183 qualifying games , has now kept four clean sheets in his last seven matches			2
9 ) even in these days of @entity187 it is still possible for a late developer to come from the bottom rungs of the football ladder to break through			0
step up striker @entity191 , who made his @entity193 debut for @entity194 in the 2 - 1 win against local rivals @entity196			0
the 24 - year - old was discovered playing for @entity198 , a village club just up the road from @entity200 , where he scored 43 goals helping win the @entity204 title and the @entity205			0
@entity206 allegedly saw that only @entity88 's half of the pitch was watered during the @entity210 game he was close to a goal on his professional debut , too – with a header that manager @entity214 claimed had crossed the line but the ref ruled did n’t			1
10 ) @entity206 is not averse to a bit of gamesmanship			0
the sprinklers at @entity220 were switched on at half time against @entity210 – but only to water the half of the pitch that @entity88 would be attacking after the break			1
that meant the @entity227 ’s attacking stars could enjoy a slick surface to ping the ball around going forward , while his defenders would find it easier to keep their feet .			0

@entity16 is beating *compatriot* @entity10 's record at @entity12
@entity45 has played every minute of @entity36 's season
@entity72 gave a bright display for @entity91 against @entity84
@entity48 have received fewer *cautions* than any other team in the league
@entity97 is proving a shrewd *investment* by @entity99
@entity120 is failing to live up to *expectations* at @entity122
@entity156 are reaping rewards of @entity142 's *reunion* with @entity144
@entity206 allegedly only had @entity88 's half of the pitch watered during half time of clash with @entity210
