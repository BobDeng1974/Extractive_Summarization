@entity25 , @entity26 ( @entity24 score : 33.6 ) last year , @entity26 finished five points above the relegation zone			1
every point counts in the harsh climate of the @entity2 and @entity25 , boasting an 83.3 per cent pass completion rate , spared the @entity26 ' opening - day blushes with an 85th - minute goal to earn a draw against @entity36			1
it measures a player 's contribution to the success of his team			2
the intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses			0
so , what are the six indices ? 1			0
player 's performance per match 3			2
@entity59 , @entity60 ( 34.4 ) @entity60 welcomed @entity61 back to the @entity2 by stripping them of any points at @entity63 , and @entity59 was as big a part of that away win as anyone			1
the 22 - year - old left the capital having kept a 95.8 per cent pass completion rate throughout , and showed @entity70 what they missed out on			0
@entity72 , @entity73 ( 35.7 ) scoring a last - minute winner in a @entity76 derby on your debut in the first game of the @entity2 season says it all			1
on saturday , a 20 - year - old by the name of @entity72 did just that			2

@entity95 , @entity96 ( 37.5 ) the only team to win at home on saturday , @entity96 can thank @entity95 for making that happen against a manager-less @entity100 in the aftermath of losing @entity102			2
with the equalising goal , six clearances and four interceptions , the 28 - year - old centre - back was a rock in the heart of the defence , and earned his three points at the @entity111			0
no 7 : @entity96 's @entity95 used his head to help them be the only team to win at home on saturday well done : @entity95 got the equaliser , made six clearances and four interceptions against @entity100 earned : @entity96 started the @entity2 season with three points at the @entity111 over @entity100 6			1
@entity18 , @entity96 ( 39.8 ) the clock struck 90 but @entity18 did n't care			1
the 23 - year - old was in the right place at the right time to earn @entity96 three points in the dying moments , just as a broken @entity100 side thought they 'd earned a share of the spoils in north @entity76			0
the @entity127 international added 65 passes in the opposition half , completed 92 overall , and boasted an 86.8 per cent completion rate for good measure			0
no 6 : @entity18 was in the right place at the right time to earn @entity96 three points in the dying moments earned : the @entity127 star added 65 passes in the opposition half and completed 92 overall at the @entity111 @entity136 lauds late @entity18 goal 5			1
@entity19 , @entity138 ( 39.9 ) it all went according to plan for @entity60			1
no slip ups , no surprises			0
@entity19 , as per usual , was among those making life uncomfortable for @entity145 , scoring once and making 51 passes in the opposition half with a tidy 88.2 per cent pass completion rate			1
it was as if the 28 - year - old had never been away			0
no 5 : @entity19 of @entity138 ensured @entity145 did not cause an upset at @entity152 surrounded : @entity19 scores the opening goal on sunday as @entity60 ran out 2 - 0 winners in the @entity2 up there : @entity19 made life uncomfortable , making 51 passes in the opposition half with a tidy 88.2 per cent rate 4			1
@entity160 , @entity60 ( 42.8 ) @entity162 , showing the strength needed in the @entity2 , shrugged off @entity163 , @entity61 's export from @entity165 , and nabbed the goal that won the game			1
the centre - back did n't forget his duties at the back either , making 14 clearances and three blocks			0
no 4 : @entity160 helped @entity60 beat @entity61 at @entity63 and was equally solid in defence as well 3			0
@entity174 , @entity175 ( 47.5 ) @entity175 failed to read the script when they beat @entity165 2 - 1 at @entity177 on saturday - not that they cared			0
it was @entity174 who ultimately spoiled the @entity181 party , restoring the @entity184 club 's advantage with less than 20 minutes remaining			0

@entity196 , @entity36 ( 50.4 ) @entity36 's top goalscorer of last season got off the mark somewhat emphatically			1
two goals , five crosses delivered and an 82.1 per cent pass completion rate warranted more than the point he got in return against @entity26			0
that 's one way to tell manager @entity209 to put his name on the team - sheet first ahead of new Â£ 10million signing @entity212			0
no 2 : @entity196 was runner up for the @entity2 's top 10 of the weekend as @entity36 drew 2 - 2 1			1
@entity17 , @entity214 ( 52.3 ) a performance that leads those on @entity217 to deem life after @entity219 is there after all has to be special , and @entity17 delivered that reassurance at @entity222 on sunday			2
a goal , an assist , an 81.8 pass completion rate and five successful dribbles compiled the misery on @entity228 , who fell to a 2 - 1 defeat on their return without @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235			0
no 1 : @entity17 proved there is life after @entity219 with an outstanding performance for @entity214 @entity219 who ? a goal , an assist , an 81.8 pass completion rate and five successful dribbles helped @entity214 win 2 - 1			2
