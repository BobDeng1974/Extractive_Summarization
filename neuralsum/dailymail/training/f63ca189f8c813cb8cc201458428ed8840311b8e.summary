she said : ' we need to have the basic protections regarding a handful of dangerous criminals			0
under scrutiny : @entity170 's identity card ' does that mean demanding the sharing of information by countries ? that ’s the question we are asking			0
' a @entity178 spokesman said : ' the onus for flagging someone ’s criminal history lies with the police in their home country - we would then use this information to decide whether they should be allowed into the @entity42			0
' @entity15 conservative mp @entity186 said : ' on the face of it , the first question we should ask is how did an escaped criminal on the run from @entity7 not get picked up at the @entity42 border ? ' either he had false documents that were not detected or he may have been smuggled in			2
