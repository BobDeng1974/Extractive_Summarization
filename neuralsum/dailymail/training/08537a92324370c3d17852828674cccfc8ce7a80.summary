by @entity0 published : 07:25 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 08:49 est , 16 july 2013 tragedy : @entity2 died in agony after being continually refused an ambulance to take him to hospital a vulnerable man died in agony from gallstones after his desperate pleas for an ambulance to hospital were refused by a 999 call handler who told him to take a warm bath instead			1
@entity2 died just 30 minutes after he eventually arrived at hospital - two days after he first telephoned the emergency services for help			1
the 41 - year - old had been struck down with painful gallstones , which could have been cured with a routine operation			1
mr @entity2 had called for an ambulance on march 29 this year and later tried spoke to an out - of - hours gp			1
he was finally rushed to @entity20 on april 1 - but suffered a fatal heart attack triggered by gallstones blocking his pancreatic duct			1
to add to his devastated family 's distress his 60 - year - old mother @entity25 passed away at the hospital on the same day			1
mr @entity2 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , begged a 999 operator three times for an ambulance during the first seven - and - a - half minute call but was refused each time			1
at one stage the dispatcher even told him to call back if he fell unconscious before dismissing his moans as stomach ache			1
eventually the operator said : ' from what you 've told me you do n't need an ambulance			1
' but the desperate patient replied : ' but i 'm in agony			0
' he was then advised to take a warm bath to ease the pain and the case was passed on to an out - of - hours gp			0
@entity2 waited 90 - minutes before the doctor called him back , and told the medic he was in agony and about to pass out in a three - and - a - half minute conversation			1
desperate : after two days of asking for help , mr @entity2 was taken to @entity55 ( pictured ) , but within 30 minutes he was dead but the doctor refused to come and see him , ordering @entity2 - who lived alone and could not drive - to get to a surgery			1
when he failed to turn up for the appointment his records were marked ' did not attend ' and no further checks were made on his condition			0
the 41 - year - old was not seen until a care worker found him writhing in agony on the floor of his home on april 1 and called 999			2
close friend @entity67 , 40 , who had been visiting @entity2 's mother in hospital on the day when mark arrived in @entity71 said : ' i was really close to @entity2 when we were boys and even though we drifted apart , i stood over his body and vowed for old times ' sake to find answers to what had gone wrong as there is no - one else around to do it			1
' what should have been a simple operation was never allowed to happen because he could not get an ambulance			2
' his great distress and pain is clear from the calls			0
' he even mentions gallstones on both calls but even that did n't bring an ambulance			1
' because he does n't give the right answers there are catastrophic failings in the emergency system			0
' he was trying to do the decent thing and answer the questions honestly - but that did not pay			0
' astonishingly no - one even asks if he is on his own or vulnerable			0
' i had a real battle getting the transcripts and wo n't give up now to make sure no - one suffers in the same way			0
' @entity103 : @entity67 , left , promised his friend @entity2 , pictured right aged 11 in 1982 , that he would try to expose what happened before he died this year a post-mortem discovered that @entity2 died after his pancreatic duct was blocked by gallstones			1
@entity109 has defended their handling of the case , saying they followed ' national guidelines			1
' a spokesman said : ' the call was assessed using national guidelines based on the information provided by the caller			1
' as a result the patient 's condition was judged not to be immediately life - threatening			0
' to try to assist the patient , the call - handler made the necessary arrangements for an out - of - hours @entity124 to contact the patient			2
' we had no further contact until two days later when a further 999 call was received			1
' on this occasion an ambulance and a rapid response vehicle were dispatched , arriving within six minutes			1
' unfortunately , despite best efforts , the man died shortly after arrival at hospital			1
' the trust has carried out a full investigation which determined that the calls were handled correctly			0
' as part of the process , we have organised a multi-agency meeting with senior clinicians and the family to further discuss the circumstances and establish if any lessons can be learnt			0
