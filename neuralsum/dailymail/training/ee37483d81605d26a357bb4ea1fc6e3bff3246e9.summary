shuffling feet , buck passing , red faces ... welcome to the latest twist in @entity4 ’s striker saga			1
@entity5 , a manager who apparently could do no wrong last season , now appears unable to get anything right			1
the @entity10 boss thought @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 would fulfil his team ’s goal needs after allowing @entity17 to head to @entity18			1
@entity11 , 24 goals last season , fair enough and @entity5 was not to know he would be injured so early in the season			1
@entity11 ’s one goal , against @entity42 , was way back in august			0
but £ 16million @entity12 was always going to be a gamble , @entity13 a steady - eddie from the bench and , as for @entity14 , he has only ever been seen as a make - weight			2
the trio have not scored in 998 minutes of @entity48 action between them and that puts a question mark on another @entity5 decision			0
he sanctioned a £ 10million splurge on @entity54 teenager @entity21 from @entity26 then loaned him back to the @entity56 club for the whole of this season			1
£ 16million striker @entity12 , in action against @entity60 , is yet to score for @entity4 in the @entity48 @entity14 and @entity13 , a summer signing from @entity42 , have struggled this season now @entity5 wants the 19 - year - old , who became the youngest scorer in @entity54 @entity66 history in the summer , for @entity4			1
but there is one stumbling block – @entity26 will want compensation for cutting short the loan agreement			1
surely @entity4 should have thought of that before allowing him to go back ? a call - back option in january is hardly unusual in these circumstances			2
@entity28 was not cheap at the initial price but his purchase could now be very expensive indeed , more money needlessly spent			0
the exciting young talent of @entity81 descent was being chased by the @entity82 earlier this year before @entity83 stepped in and selected him for @entity85 2014			0
@entity11 , in the stands for @entity4 's defeat against @entity60 , is closing in on a return to action @entity17 moved to @entity18 in the summer and @entity4 are sorely missing his services @entity5 is enduring a difficult season @entity93 the talk was all about @entity94 and the injured @entity95 but it was @entity28 who caught the eye on the biggest stage of all			1
this year he has scored five goals in @entity56 football and netted for his country in @entity19 ’s 3 - 1 win over @entity20 this week			2
and that makes him a valuable commodity on @entity107 right now , where things are going from bad to worse for @entity5			0
compare @entity28 with the current @entity4 crop			1
@entity12 has two goals this season , neither of them in 685 minutes of league action			1
he has started in eight of his nine league appearances this season			0
last year the @entity116 scored 14 goals , which is not a bad return in @entity119 , but it appears to have been a flash in the pan judging by his efforts so far for @entity4			2
talking about flash in the pan , @entity14 , 23 , first appeared on the radar in 2011 with six goals in nine appearances on loan at @entity129			0
@entity4 paid £ 10.5m to @entity130 for his services but he was never going to get a look - in with @entity17 and @entity11 in full cry			2
on loan at @entity136 last season , @entity14 netted nine goals for a struggling side			2
so far he has been a substitute in three of his four matches			0
@entity141 winger @entity140 is @entity4 's top scorer this season with three goals to his name @entity13 , 32 , will be feeling the most wretched			1
he is a lifelong @entity4 fan and must have thought all his dreams had come true with his £ 4m switch from @entity42			2
the @entity141 forward scored 14 goals for @entity42 last season but has been forced to take a back seat at @entity10			0
he has come on as a substitute in three of his four matches			0
last year @entity5 was in charge of a team who were title contenders thanks to the most devastating striking partnership in the @entity48			0
filling the hole left by @entity17 was always going to be a big ask			0
but the fact of the matter is that @entity4 ’s top scorer in the @entity48 so far is winger @entity140 , with three goals and december approaching			1
time to send out an sos to @entity28 ?			0

@entity5 sanctioned £ 10m move for @entity28 but sent him out on loan
he now wants the @entity19 *international* , currently at @entity26 , back in his team
but @entity26 are demanding compensation for cutting short the loan agreement
@entity4 's top scorer this season is @entity140 with three goals
£ 16m @entity12 is without a goal in the league despite playing nine times
