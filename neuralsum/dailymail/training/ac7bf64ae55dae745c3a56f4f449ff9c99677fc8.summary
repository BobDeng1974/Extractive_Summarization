these surreal photographs are instantly familiar to any fan of @entity2 - they show the landscape of @entity4 , where @entity5 grew up in the sci - fi blockbuster			1
but the pictures were not captured when the series was being filmed in the 1970s , but in fact date back just a few weeks			0
the sets which director @entity11 used to create his epic vision are still standing in the deserts of @entity14 , where they have been a focus of pilgrimage for @entity2 obsessives for decades			2
scroll down for the original trailer iconic : this house was the home of @entity5 on @entity4 in the @entity2 films still standing : the sets are visible in @entity14 desert nearly four decades after the first film was filmed futuristic : these vapourisers were featured in the film and have never been removed from the desert photographer and artist @entity30 made it her mission to find the @entity4 sets after researching the sites where major blockbusters were filmed			1
using just @entity37 as a guide , she ventured into the @entity39 to find the abandoned set			1
much of the former @entity4 has been swallowed up by the desert and now lies buried in the sand			1
however , that part which remains above ground has been preserved by the hot and dry climate , making it almost identical to when it appeared in the 1977 film			0
pilgrimage : photographer @entity30 found the @entity4 set by searching on @entity37 inhospitable : in the @entity2 films , @entity4 is a scorching planet warmed by two suns - making the unforgiving @entity14 desert the perfect place to film remote : filmmakers never got round to removing the set from the uninhabited @entity39 region surprise : ms @entity30 said she was taken aback by the intensity of the response to her pictures ' when i realised some film @entity2 film props were left , i thought they would make for some very powerful images , ' ms @entity30 said			1
' so i decided to go to @entity14 and eventually found these three locations in very different conditions			0
' i was so happy to have found the ruins , they are fascinating but it can be a very eerie experience seeing them , especially if you are alone			0
i have great childhood memories of the films			0
derelict : swathes of the set have been destroyed by the advance of the desert poignant : the abandoned sets have been standing in the desert for several decades destination : @entity14 , where the ruins can be found , used to be a popular tourist hotspot comeback : the country could try to use its @entity2 legacy to attract visitors once again ' i was surprised at the reaction from fans , there is a real obsession for anything to do with @entity2			2
' the @entity99 - based photographer has gathered her images into a series entitled no more stars			2
