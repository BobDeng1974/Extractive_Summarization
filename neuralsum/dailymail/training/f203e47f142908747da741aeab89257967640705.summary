by comparison , @entity50 ' @entity49 system which the woman 's car was equipped with			1
relies solely on the gps system			0
many smartphone apps that provide navigation information keep track of users ' locations over time			2

police spent two hours searching the area for her car , but found no sign of it			2
the search resumed the following morning after the woman 's stepmother called police to report her missing after she failed to return home			1
it was at that point officers had the idea of using the tracking app to find the missing woman			2
rescue : the 28 - year - old was airlifted to safety and is in stable condition off road : the @entity31 left the road at this bend , on a route round @entity10 , near @entity11 , @entity12 rescuers : emergency services traced the woman 's cellphone to find her on the wooded slope after two hours , the woman 's cellphone provider said the phone was within a seven - mile radius of @entity132 , @entity87 said			1

' at that point it raised our concern it was something more than on @entity49 issue			0
' officer @entity155 went to the family 's home and asked if the woman has a @entity6			0
@entity155 then helped the family use the woman 's @entity27 to use the @entity6 , which gave them a location near @entity10			1
@entity87 said @entity155 guessed the woman 's password - on the third or fourth try - to unlock the @entity27 and the @entity166 app. @entity155 , who has been an officer with the department since 1998 and has a mind for computers , tinkered on a computer at @entity9 's home , until he figured out her password			2
' i just tried to make an educated guess , ' he said , describing himself as a ' tech geek			0
' area : this is the steep , wooden slope down which the car tumbled a distance of 500ft with the woman inside if you have an apple device -- an @entity6 , @entity27 or a @entity183 - you can use the @entity6 feature to locate your device on a map			1
it 'll even play a sound so you can track it down			0
and if you think your phone was stolen or lost , you can lock it and then track it			0
or just erase all the information on the phone			0
all you have to do is log into your @entity193 account and activate the app. @entity139 police then contacted the @entity196 and @entity197 at about 4 a.m. with the new information , including a screen shot of where the @entity6 was located			0
