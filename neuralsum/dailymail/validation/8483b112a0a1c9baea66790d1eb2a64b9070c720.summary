en famille : @entity0 and her children in @entity2 breathless , but with an unmistakeable swagger , our three children burst through the door of our mobile home and regale us with their latest news			1
' we 've changed our minds about croissants and have got pain au chocolat instead , ' announces @entity12 , eight , swinging a bag full of freshly baked @entity15 pastries			0
behind him , his twin siblings @entity16 and @entity17 , six , brandish a newspaper and my change , respectively , which they thrust onto the table like warriors returning from battle			0
we are halfway through a week - long break at @entity27 holiday park in @entity28 , near @entity29 , in the @entity30 , and it is the fourth time our children have completed this morning ritual			1
it takes them approximately nine minutes to make the round trip to the campsite shop ( they could do it in half the time if they were n't stopping to examine every rock and tree along the way ) and the sojourn has lost none of its thrill			0
at home in @entity50 , such independence is the stuff of their dreams			0
@entity27 fits our bill completely : pool , play - park , shop , takeaway , @entity61 - speaking kids ' club , games room , nightly entertainment			1
@entity28 has the added aesthetic attraction of being built round an original medieval village restored by the grandparents of the current owners nearly 40 years ago			0
accommodation is a mixture of tents , touring pitches and mobile homes			1
we opt for a three - bedroom mobile home perched on a small hill surrounded by woodland , with an unbroken view of the valley below			1
inside , the sleek lines and cool grey colours have more in common with a boutique hotel			0
@entity16 and @entity81 share one twin - bedded room , @entity12 ( the earliest riser ) has the other one			2
a lot of reasons to be cheerful : @entity88 is one of the many pretty towns which dot the region my husband and i have the double room , which boasts its own en - suite shower room , and we quickly settle into a routine that begins with the croissant run , breakfast on the terrace and two hours of ' mini-club ' for children aged four to 12			2
lunch is another lazy affair on the terrace with more fresh bread from the shop , cheeses , meat and fruits from the stadium - sized @entity110 supermarket at @entity29 , before an afternoon of hurtling down pool slides and playing tennis			1
in the evenings , we light the barbecue provided before decamping en masse to the bar for the evening entertainment			0
we do manage to drag the children off site a couple of times			2
my favourite trip is the 40 - minute drive to the @entity124 pilgrimage site of @entity125 , which , like something from a children 's fairy tale , clings to the cliffs above a gorge			2
our children would say the eight - mile journey aboard the steam train at @entity134 , which handily includes an ice - cream stop and costs a family - friendly £ 7.50 ) for adults and £ 4 per child			1
the lesson from our holiday is that keeping it simple is the best rule because , for our children , the croissant runs arguably were the highlight of the day			2
ferries from @entity146 to @entity147 can be booked at @entity148			0
fares with @entity145 ( 0871 244 07446 , brittany - ferries.co.uk ) start at £ 79 each way for a car plus two passengers			0
a mobile home at @entity155 ( 0033 2 23 16 45 02 , camping - castels.co.uk ) costs from £ 4.60 per person per night .			1
