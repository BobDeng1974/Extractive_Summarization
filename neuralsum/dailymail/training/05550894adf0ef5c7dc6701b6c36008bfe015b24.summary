photographed using a specialized microscope whose viewing stage is chilled to @entity5 , scientists in @entity1 are showing a whole new side to what 's caught on the tip of our tongues			1
using a low - temperature scanning electron microscope , researchers at the @entity12 have captured an astonishing new view on naturally - occurring snowflakes			1
shipping in the samples collected from snow banks or during fresh snow fall from around the country , the researchers study their composition for their effects on our ecosystem			1
more importantly to the scientists than how they look , cosmetically at least , is the data gained from where they were collected that 's of value			2
' information gained from studying the structure of snow is vital to several areas of science as well as to activities that affect our daily lives ... ' the website of the @entity78 and @entity79 states			0
the hydrologists explain the flakes ' use to determine the winter snow pack 's water content to better determine the nation 's water supply and how to better protect from flooding			0
artificial : a closeup on some artificial snow shows a much smoother contrast from the naturally made snow shipped : the snowflakes are shipped to the center in @entity1 from natural sources outside the state collecting : the snowflakes are either brushed onto copper flakes held by researchers or allowed to fall naturally on them preservation : once the flakes are captured they are right away dipped in liquid nitrogen , cooling them down to -196c stuck : the copper plates used to catch the flakes are also coated on one side with methyl cellulose - a gel like solution shipping : once captured on the copper plate , they can be shipped in a previously liquid nitrogen - cooled dewar using flat copper plates precooled to the same outside temperature and coated on one side with methyl cellulose - a gel like solution - researchers from outside the state collect the snow samples on this pallet before sending it out			1
the field researchers report either allowing the snowflakes to fall and settle on the plate 's surface or lightly brushing them on themselves			0
once collected , the plates are rapidly plunged in liquid nitrogen , cooling them down to -196c			0
the plates can then be shipped in a previously liquid nitrogen - cooled dewar , providing them with thermal insulation before transported by air or ground			0
@entity139 : like a prickly sundial , one flake reveals a hexagon plate with a frosty siding extra details : a glass - like snowflake in the upper right - hand corner shows the center flake before pulling in to a view 79 times its size depth : zooming into each flake reveals more and more spiny edges and crevices that appear to go on forever @entity154 : shown at the top , a flake is seen magnified 908 times while at the bottom the same area is seen magnified 1,860 times variety : appearing as though brushed with icing , some snowflakes appear more rounded than the others typically seen as thorny guessing game : depending on your interests , a close up on this snowflake could resemble a simple barbell or a @entity172 fighter from @entity173 surfaces : another snowflake , tinged in blue with the help of a computer , shows smoother , stacked surfaces structures : another snowflake shows what the researchers call columns and plates video : montage of some of the most amazing snowflakes captured on camera ...			2
