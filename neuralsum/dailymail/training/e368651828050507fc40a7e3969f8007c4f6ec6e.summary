by @entity0 published : 19:29 est , 19 may 2013 updated : 02:01 est , 20 may 2013 more money : commons speaker @entity2 , who has backed pay rises for mps , has taken a 1 per cent pay hike @entity5 are in line for a dramatic salary rise of up to £ 20,000 in a move likely to reignite public fury over their pay and perks			1
they could take home up to £ 80,000 a year – more than three times the national average – under new recommendations			0
the @entity17 ( @entity18 ) , which reports next month , has been looking at an increase of between £ 10,000 and £ 20,000			1
but the lower figure is considered more likely to try and minimise the public backlash , which would take @entity5 ' pay , currently £ 65,738 , up to £ 75,000			1
it comes as the commons speaker @entity2 , who has backed pay rises for mps , has taken a 1 per cent pay hike taking his pay just above the prime minister ’s £ 142,500 salary			1
the hike , which will probably be delayed until after 2015 , will be partly offset by curbs to their gold - plated pensions and personal expenses			0
@entity18 , which was handed responsibility for mps ’ salaries and pensions two years ago in the wake of the expense scandal , has been carrying out a long review of @entity5 salaries			1
its members believe salaries should be raised to bring politicians in line with senior civil servants and other professions			0
mr @entity2 said in 2009 that they should earn as much as a gp or a council boss , many of whom take home more than £ 100,000 , as their jobs had ‘ equal breadth , scope and contact with the public			1
’ he has recently taken a swipe at @entity57 , saying party leaders should not block pay rises to ‘ appease the public ’ and it was unfair on those politicians who are not independently wealthy			0
one senior mp told a newspaper yesterday he feared @entity5 would be ‘ accused of having their snouts in the trough ’			0
but he argued : ‘ voters may not like it , but if you pay peanuts you get monkeys			0
’ taking the lead : cabinet ministers including @entity57 are in a five - year pay freeze , saving the taxpayer £ 3million but @entity84 mp @entity83 , who opposes pay rises for mps said : ‘ they should throw this proposal in the bin , it will just create more bad publicity for mps			2
it would be completely unacceptable , we are in the middle of a recession			0
’ @entity89 , chief executive of the @entity90 ’ @entity91 , said : ‘ politicians should n't get huge pay hikes when taxpayers and other public sector workers are facing pay freezes and cuts			0
‘ mps are already very well paid , and have other perks like gold - plated pensions that most taxpayers could never afford for themselves			0
' there ca n't be one rule for @entity5 and another for the rest of the country			0
if politicians accept this rise it will send out completely the wrong message about pay restraint from the heart of @entity111			2
’ @entity18 is likely to demand that @entity5 give up their guaranteed pensions and switch to a less generous scheme			2
if so , most if not all of the pay rise , will be needed to match their current pension deal , which is more generous than for most of the public sector because mps pay in for fewer years before drawing a full pension and get a much larger contribution from the taxpayer			1
' they should throw this proposal in the bin , it will just create more bad publicity for @entity5 ' @entity84 mp @entity83 @entity126 , which has no input into @entity18 ’s proposals , is likely to be alarmed by the effect of the pay rise on their ‘ all in this together ’ message and the squeeze on public sector pay			1
cabinet ministers including mr @entity57 are in a five - year pay freeze , saving the taxpayer £ 3million			2
none of the party leaders will be keen to annoy their backbenchers by breaking ranks and opposing , and it is understood they will discuss how to how to handle the potentially toxic announcement			0
in a recent consultation , a third of @entity5 told @entity18 they thought they pay should go up to £ 86,000 with some demanding more than £ 100,000			1
@entity5 pay has been frozen for two years but will rise by 1 per cent this year and next			2
mr @entity2 , mp for @entity147 has accepted the rise , taking his £ 142,162 deal up by £ 664 , more than the prime minister and £ 8,000 more than a cabinet minister .			1

@entity18 reports next month and has been looking at rise of £ 10,000 to £ 20,000
lower figure more likely and would take mps pay from £ 65,738 to £ 75,000
commons speaker @entity2 has already taken a 1 *%* pay rise
