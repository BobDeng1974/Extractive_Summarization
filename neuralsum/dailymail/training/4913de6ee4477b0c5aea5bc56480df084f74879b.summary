@entity1 's first minister @entity0 has been accused of playing politics with today 's royal baby announcement			1
the @entity5 leader used the official @entity1 titles of the @entity7 and @entity8 in a message welcoming the news this morning			1
he wrote : ' congratulations & best wishes to the @entity13			0
wonderful to hear they 're expecting their second baby – very happy news ! ' mr @entity0 's intervention , just 10 days before the @entity1 independence referendum , comes amid mounting mounting concern in @entity20 about the prospect of a ‘ yes ’ vote			1
the future of the royal family has been a source of debate in the independence campaign , but the ' yes ' camp have insisted that the @entity29 will remain head of state in a future independent @entity1			1
but one labour mp today suggested mr @entity0 had used the royal couple 's official @entity1 titles to ram home the point that the monarchy would still be in place after independence			1
the @entity52 actor returned to @entity1 to join deputy first minister @entity53 making a final push for votes ahead of september 18			1
amid criticism that he will not have to face the consequences of a ‘ no ’ vote , mr @entity47 said : ‘ it kind of gets my goat when people say that			0
‘ nobody says why ca n’t @entity43 or @entity64 have a say , they ’re not able to vote either			0
’ he added : ‘ i feel so passionate about this			0
my brother said yesterday , he lives in @entity68 , in @entity69 , so he does n’t have a vote either , he said ‘ it does n’t matter that i do n’t live in @entity1 , @entity1 lives inside of me			2
' @entity71 , mp for @entity72 and @entity73 , said : ‘ this is fantastic news for the royal family and for everybody in the country and should not be politicised in any way			2
‘ @entity0 is absolutely shameless in his determination to shoehorn his obsession with independence into everything and anything			2
’ the future of the royal family in an independent @entity1 has been thrown into doubt in recent days amid claims that the @entity29 is concerned about future conflicts of interest			1
pollsters today claimed that the @entity91 baby announcement could help tip support back in favour of the union			1
a spokesman for @entity96 told @entity97 : ‘ @entity29 is generally very popular in the @entity50 and so are the young royals like the @entity7 and @entity8 , probably more so than prince @entity99 for example			2
‘ the royal family has not really played a part in the referendum debate until now but the @entity29 ’s reported concerns and now @entity8 ’s pregnancy will bring that into focus			1
‘ there are a number of reasons why the poll could swing back to no. it wo n’t be just because of the baby , but that and other issues about the royal family could influence the result ’			2
but a poll in the @entity117 found more ‘ yes ’ voters now want to ditch the @entity29 as head of state of an independent @entity1 than want to keep her in place , according to a new poll			0
the @entity123 poll found that 46 per cent of supporters of separation now believe that an independent @entity1 should break its links with the @entity50 royal family			2
a total of 40 per cent believe an independent @entity1 should keep the @entity29 , with 14 per cent undecided			0
among ‘ no ’ voters , the results are very different			0
more than two thirds of ‘ no ’ voters – 69 per cent – believe that an independent @entity1 should keep the @entity29 , with just 18 per cent in favour of a @entity1 republic and 13 per cent undecided			0
when the @entity8 first became pregnant in december 2012 the @entity5 leader mr @entity0 was quick to offer his ‘ warmest congratulations ’ - but again used the official @entity1 titles			1
mr @entity0 added : ‘ everyone in @entity1 will join me in wishing the couple the very best as they prepare for the birth of their first child			1
’ labour leader @entity64 sent his regards on @entity145 this morning the prime minister today responded to the news on @entity145			1
he said : ‘ many congratulations to the @entity7 and @entity8			0
i 'm delighted by the happy news that they 're expecting another baby			1
’ after the @entity8 first fell pregnant mr @entity43 said she and prince @entity46 would make ‘ absolutely brilliant parents ’			0
mr @entity43 confirmed he was informed of the news shortly before the public announcement			0
he added : ‘ i got a little note coming into a meeting i was having and i found it quite difficult to keep it to myself			0
’ the following year , in 2013 , mr @entity43 revealed how the entire @entity159 was sent into a panic thinking that the royal baby had arrived during a meeting at @entity163			0
but the piece of paper rushed into a meeting was not an update from the palace but the latest from @entity170 's cricket ground			0
the official portrait for the christening of @entity173 of @entity174 , photographed in @entity175 at @entity176 in @entity177 on october 23 , 2013 prince @entity46 and @entity8 with @entity179 day - old prince @entity178 is photographed with their dog @entity182 , in the garden of the @entity184 home in @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity69 the prime minister had instructed officials to keep him informed of the score from the @entity192 match between @entity69 and @entity193			1
he said : ‘ we had a @entity159 meeting and i asked someone to bring in the cricket score half way through just to see how it was going			0
‘ and a bit of paper arrived in the @entity159 room and everyone of course thought it was an announcement about the royal baby			2
‘ there was a great intake of breath and actually it was because @entity210 wanted to know what the score was because he was meant to be at @entity213			0
’ in 2010 when it was announced that @entity46 and @entity8 were to marry mr @entity43 revealed that he had received the news in a call from @entity20 during a cabinet meeting , and it was greeted with ‘ a great cheer ’ and ‘ banging of the table ’ from fellow ministers .			1

@entity0 said : ' wonderful to hear they 're expecting their second baby '
royal couple 's official @entity1 titles are @entity228 and @entity8
announcement comes just 10 days before @entity1 referendum next week
future of the @entity91 in the *spotlight* amid ' concern ' in @entity20
