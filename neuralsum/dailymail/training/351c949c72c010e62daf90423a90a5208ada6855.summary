former @entity1 fast bowler @entity0 has labelled @entity2 ' a very bitter man ' and does not see any way back for the 34 - year - old in international cricket			1
@entity2 , sacked by the @entity1 eight months ago , has been highly critical of some of his former team - mates and former team director @entity9 in his autobiography , which went on general sale on thursday			1
in an interview with the @entity15 , the 34 - year - old claimed he could yet return to international cricket - if @entity1 chairman @entity17 departed the scene - but @entity0 thinks that idea is fanciful			1
' i think he 's a very bitter man			1
i think @entity2 wanted to get rid of @entity9 when he was the captain as well , so i think there 's a little bit of personal vindictiveness in there			1
' but man - management is part of the skill of being a good leader and a good coach			0
if @entity9 had been lacking and had n't been able to rein in one of the best @entity1 players we 've had in recent years , it 's a very sad state of affairs			1
' asked whether he thought there was a way back into the international fold for @entity2 , @entity0 replied on @entity46 : ' no. ' ' kp : the autobiography ' includes @entity2 's account of a culture of ' bullying ' in the dressing room under @entity9 's regime and allegedly orchestrated largely by @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
@entity0 ( second right with @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity2 and @entity60 ) at @entity61 in 2005 prior came in for most stinging criticism , tagged the ' schoolyard bully who was also the teacher 's pet '			1
@entity0 defended his former team - mate , saying : ' his nickname is " @entity67 "			1
he came from @entity68 with the name " @entity67 "			0
' i 've played a lot of cricket with @entity56			2
he 's very much a team man , very much wants to win , demands high standards and wants to push everybody			2
i do n't know if he 's a bully - he does have high standards and wants everybody to achieve the best they can do			2
' former @entity82 captain @entity81 , speaking at a wine - tasting event at @entity80 , struggled to contain his laughter when asked whether he could see @entity2 in an @entity1 shirt again			1
' i would have thought there 'd be no chance after this book 's come out , to be honest , but you never know what happens in the future ! ' he said			2
' i 'm sure if he got back in the nets and played for a county and scored the runs he 'd put the pressure on them			0
' ( but ) certainly there 's a few people disgruntled with his book , so i ca n't imagine that 'll happen in the near future			0
' @entity0 vehemently defended @entity56 , who came in for stinging criticism from @entity2 in the book @entity81 , who retired from @entity104 in 2011 , played down talk of bullying within the @entity1 camp , but acknowledged there were ' niggles ' and ' discrepancies '			1
' i think ' bullying ' is probably a very strong word , ' he said			0
' it 's quite disappointing that people are forgetting these times we 've had over last seven years have been one of probably most successful times in @entity119 cricket			1
it 's been a great era - we 've won three ashes , a @entity122			0
' if there was so much going on behind the scenes , i 'd be very surprised if you could go on and win all these things			0
you 're always going to have niggles in a team environment			0
the @entity1 team travel around together probably 300 days a year , so you 're always going to have behind - the - scenes niggles going on , but in the end the performance on the pitch is what counts			1
' you always get discrepancies in the dressing room			0
how you iron things out is the main thing , and how you move forward			0
there are times when players go overboard			0
but as long as you can have a beer with these guys and move forward , all should be good			0
' he added : ' i would n't say @entity2 was the easiest to manage , but he was manageable at the time i played			2
the last two years i have n't been involved with the dressing room			0
the sad thing is it looks as though it 's all broken up , the relationships in the dressing room			0
' @entity154 calls @entity1 report ' an embarrassment '			2

@entity2 's autobiography has caused *friction* in the cricket world
former @entity1 *seamer* @entity0 called @entity2 ' very bitter '
@entity0 alleges @entity2 tried to oust @entity9 when he was captain
