@entity0 has backed former @entity2 team - mate and @entity4 defender @entity3 to defy his critics and prove his worth after a disappointing start to life at @entity9			1
@entity3 joined @entity10 on a one - year deal in july , linking up with his former @entity13 boss @entity12 in the process , after 12 successful years at @entity15			1
however , things have n’t entirely gone to plan for the 35 - year - old , with him coming under a barrage of criticism for his performances so far this season as the @entity23 ’s sit rock - bottom of the @entity24			1
when speaking to @entity35 at the @entity36 he said : ‘ i have no doubt in my mind that @entity39 can still compete at the top			2
‘ i came back to @entity41 when i was 35 and played at the highest level for six months so why ca n't he ? ‘ at that time i felt i was the best defender around in the second half of that season ( 2009 - 2010 ) too and should have gone to the @entity44 , so there ’s no reason why @entity39 ca n’t have a similar impact to that at @entity4			1
@entity3 went on the @entity48 to announce he would be retiring at the end of the season @entity3 was dropped by manager @entity12 to the bench for @entity4 's defeat to @entity53 last sunday ‘ once @entity39 gets what @entity4 are and the club understand him , everything will be fine			1
’ considering @entity4 ’s current plight , supporters would n't have been entirely pleased to have heard @entity3 reveal his intention to hang up his boots at the end of the current season on the @entity48 show aired on saturday night			1
however , @entity0 has backed @entity3 to win over the @entity64 ’s faithful , and says they must remain patient with him as he adjusts to surroundings at the club			1
he added : ‘ i do n’t think anyone can question @entity39 ’s hunger and desire for the game – he ’s a top professional			2
i think people have to remember that he is getting on now - he ’s not a 21 - year - old anymore			2
‘ once you go into the latter stages of your career you have to take extra care of yourself			0
there ’s a completely different way of approaching the game			0
@entity3 and @entity0 were rock solid at the heart of the @entity2 defence for many years @entity0 ( right ) returned to @entity41 at the age of 35 and proved he could still perform at the top level ‘ there ’s a way of playing , resting , looking after your body - it ’s totally different			1
@entity12 ( @entity12 ) will know that			0
‘ when @entity91 brought me back to @entity41 he had to manage me in a completely different way to when i was at the club before			0
‘ i was obviously getting fit in pre-season , but i was n’t training every day			0
i would play and then rest and have a warm down			0
as long as you ’re ready for the game it ’s fine			0
‘ if you need your rest period you need it at the end of the day			0
there ’s always a way of working around it though and i ’m sure @entity4 and @entity39 will realise that and reap the rewards in the end			2

@entity0 has backed @entity3 to find form at @entity4
the former @entity15 defender has struggled since joining @entity64 's in july
@entity4 find themselves bottom of the @entity24
but @entity39 's former @entity2 team - mate @entity0 says he will succeed
@entity3 announced this will be his last season on @entity48
