' on the street things are n't always clear cut			0
it 's not easily scripted			0
it 's not always easy to tie up the loose ends , ' @entity0 said			0
' so the more facts and evidence we have , the more likely it is that we can get to the truth no matter what happens on the street			0
' the announcement follows a year of multiple field tests of the body cameras on a small number of the @entity34 's 9,900 officers			1
