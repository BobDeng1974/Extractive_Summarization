a @entity1 orphan has been separated from his younger sisters after his adoption by an @entity5 family was put on hold due to the deadly @entity8 outbreak			1
@entity9 and @entity10 from @entity11 in @entity12 , were due to take five - year - old @entity13 back to their home just outside of @entity16 in december after adopting his twin sisters faith and @entity18			1

now @entity13 is stranded in @entity1 because @entity8 has meant adoptions have been put on indefinite hold @entity16 couple @entity10 and @entity34 sit with their adopted twins and some of their other children as they look at pictures of @entity24 and @entity18 's older brother @entity13 , who is stranded in @entity1 @entity24 is currently receiving therapy to strengthen the use of her right hand and foot			1
but @entity13 had to be left behind in @entity1 , and because a state of emergency continues in the country as they try to contain the @entity8 threat his adoption is on hold indefinitely			1
fighting back the tears , mrs @entity34 , who also has six other children , said : ' we love @entity1 , and we want what 's best for the country as a whole			2
' it 's never a place a parent wants to be			0
' @entity61 , the director and founder of the @entity23 orphange where @entity13 is currently living is constantly updating his new parents of his progress			2
director of the orphanage where @entity13 is living says he asks everyday when he can join his @entity5 family she said : ' he 's , i guess , doing as well as can be expected , but every day , asks , " when do i get to go ? when do i get to go to @entity5 and be with my family ? " ' ' those children that have extended families , some of those extended families are afraid to reach out to them			2
' often times , the traditional thinking is that those children will always be contagious			0
' the deadly virus has caused the number of children in west @entity84 orphanages to increase and aid workers say many are struggling to cope with the influx as well as a shortage of food and supplies			0
it is estimated 7,000 children in @entity1 , @entity93 and @entity94 have lost one or more parent to the disease			0
ms @entity61 says that many of the staff at her organisation have now stopped taking a salary as funds are so low and they desperately need to raise money			0
she added : ' long after @entity8 is even eradicated , we will have the devastation and challenges left behind of these orphans who need to be cared for			0
' we ca n't do it alone			0
' @entity1 used to be a major partner with @entity5 adoption agencies , but the situation has changed recently due to complications unrelated to @entity8			1
separated from family : @entity18 points at a computer picture of her big brother @entity13 taken before they were separated while @entity24 looks on the twins were allowed to be taken back to the @entity5 by @entity116 and mrs @entity34 , pictured , as @entity24 needed medical treatment after suffering a stroke at birth according to @entity122 figures , there were only 12 adoptions from @entity1 by @entity5 in 2013 , down from a high of 353 in 2006			1
however , experts on international adoptions caution that disasters and emergencies , such as the @entity8 crisis , should not be occasions to hastily encourage adoptions			0

making permanent decisions about children 's long - term care should be kept to an absolute minimum during this period			2
