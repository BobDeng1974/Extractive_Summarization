by @entity0 some of @entity2 's most celebrated beauties are getting a facelift			0
and after almost 2,500 years it 's not surprising they 're looking a little weather - beaten			2
the @entity8 statues , which until the late 1970s propped up a section of the @entity10 on the @entity11 , are being cleansed of grime inside the museum where they 're now housed			1
the @entity8 : it will take about seven months to clean each of the larger than life - sized figurines iconic beauty : a view of the illuminated @entity11 above the old town of @entity21 restoration work is taking place in the @entity11 museum in @entity21 , surrounded by a white fabric screen to protect visitors from laser beams , which can cause permanent eye injury			1
museum director @entity29 said the main reason for cleaning the sculptures on the spot was to avoid the potential hazards of moving them			0
one of the six @entity8 was removed by @entity35 in the 19th century and today stands in the @entity36			1

' the process removes all of the pollution , the smoke and everything that has settled on the statues for more than a century , and leaves intact the patina , that orange hue that the statues took on with the passage of centuries , ' @entity29 said			1
@entity38 cleans one of the striking statues which were created in 420 bc ' it 's done with very great care to avoid any possible damage			2

it later served as a church , a @entity95 palace and a @entity97 harem			0
