by @entity0 astronomers have spotted a heart - shaped crater on the surface of @entity5			2
located close to a huge volcano or the surface of the red planet , @entity6 says the strange shape may have been caused by a volcano			1
however , the space agency is so intrigued by the unusual shape is plans to train its telescopes on the ' broken heart ' again to try and work out exactly how big it is			1
is so intrigued by the unusual shape is plans to train its @entity20 telescope on the ' broken heart ' again to try and work out exactly how big it is the heart is located south of @entity24 , which is a large volcano within the @entity26 volcanic plateau , so it is extremely likely that this feature was formed by a volcanic process			1
' the feature indeed does look like a heart , ' researchers on @entity6 's @entity20 telescope , which took the image , said			1
it is located south of @entity24 , which is a large volcano within the @entity26 volcanic plateau , so it is extremely likely that this feature was formed by a volcanic process			2
' the feature rises above the surrounding terrain and we can see concentric ridges on its top			0
' perhaps this feature is an ancient vent structure ( an opening in the ground from which volcanic lava emerges ) that has been more resistant to erosion than the surrounding area , so that it resembles ' inverted ' terrains , ' said @entity6			1
topographic inversion or inverted terrain often occurs when low areas of a landscape become filled with lava or sediments that harden into materials which are more resistant to erosion than the materials that surround them			0
erosion then removes the less resistant surrounding material , leaving behind the younger resistant material which may then appear as a ridge where previously there was a valley , or in this case , a butte , where there was once a pit or depression			0
the agency now plans to return to try and measure the @entity74 imaging of the feature to create a stereo and a digital terrain model may help in further assessing the structure by making accurate measurement of its height and the steepness of its slopes			0
the blue planet : @entity6 also released these false colour images which show dunes on the surface			1
the lighter toned tan surfaces are composed of a thick layer of dust , @entity6 said			2
the team also revealed this new image of pruple sand on the surface			0
sand on @entity5 is typically dark in tone , as it commonly derived from volcanic rocks like lava flows			2
in @entity20 enhanced color , which operates in long infrared wavelengths ( beyond what the human eye can detect ) , surfaces like these dune crests are dark blue to purple			0
@entity95 comes in sizes that are ideal for surface transport by the wind , where sand ' hops ' along forming bedforms , like these dunes after large amounts of time .			0

believe unusual shape was caused by volcanic activity
@entity6 set to take further measurements to try and *explain* the *phenomenon*
