@entity0 was immersed in publishing for five years as editor of the @entity3 blog @entity3			1
when he became a dad , he was curious how best to foster a love of books in his newborn daughter			0
his solution was - what else ? - writing a book about raising bookworms , @entity13 , out in july from @entity14			1
mr @entity0 , 37 , lives in @entity15 with his wife and now nearly four - year - old daughter , @entity17			1
he works for a film production company , connecting screenwriters with experts to assist story development			0
mr @entity0 's book coincides with a policy issued tuesday from the @entity24 asking doctors to stress that parents should read to kids every day , beginning in infancy			1
bringing up bookworms : in a new book called @entity13 , former @entity3 editor @entity0 talks about raising children in the digital age , and why parents should read to their kids every day in a new interview , the @entity36 posed four questions to @entity0 : @entity36 : is n't there enough guidance out there on fostering a love of reading in babies and young children ? mr @entity0 : when i was just starting to introduce my daughter to books , the @entity48 , lots of digital devices , were swamping the market			1
they entered the marketplace so quickly that i do n't think we as parents , or even the child development experts - no one really - had enough time to process the whole change			1
there was this rapid shift in the way we read , so i set out in the book to speak to scientists , child development experts on how best to handle the new landscape			1
@entity36 : are parents too exhausted in their child 's first year to read to them ? mr @entity0 : i started to read to my daughter from the very first few days of her life			1
on the one hand it 's boring to have these newborns			2
they do n't do very much			0
they kind of just sit there and you kind of need something to do to entertain them and entertain yourself			0
then when i started speaking to the experts about it , that act of reading , even if your child is not speaking and not pointing to things in a book , but the act and the sound of your voice is turning on switches in their brain constantly in those first two years of life			2
i did n't realize that			0
so i would set her up in her bouncy chair and as she drank her bottle i would pull out a board book and read it to her			1
every single day you would see a little bit more light in those eyes and you would see her start to follow the story a little bit			2
@entity36 : how do you feel about the recommendation of no screen time for children under two ? mr @entity0 : some parents ban it completely during those first two years			1
we definitely let @entity17 grab the @entity109 or the @entity48 when we were on airplanes or in long lines			0
we kind of used it as the pacifier of last resort			0
more to come : born @entity13 : bringing up bookworms in a @entity116 by @entity0 will hit shelves in july i still struggle on a daily basis with my daughter to balance my need for making her lunch , for doing my work or getting dressed			1
she would play with the @entity48 all day if i let her , until she fell over and fell asleep			2
she has nothing in her brain that tells her to turn it off			0
it 's a constant struggle for 21st - century parents to figure out what the perfect balance is for their child and devices			1
realistically , you ca n't have zero screen time the way the world works now , with parents using devices every day and children seeing them every day			1
they 're going to be curious			0
they 're going to want to touch them			0
@entity36 : do you think parents , pediatricians , day care providers and others do enough to read to or expose babies and young children to reading ? mr @entity0 : over the last 30 years we 've developed this very rich body of research about the science of interactive reading			1
that is reading to your child in a way where you 're asking questions , where you 're having them compare it to their own experiences , where it 's a very active , participatory experience			2
you can use a device , you can do it while watching @entity162 , with a song , but it 's you and your child and not your child and a device			2
so we 've had 30 years of research telling us it 's just crucial for a developing brain to do this			2
i feel like at a time when books , maybe , are receding a little bit from the public imagination , it 's almost a public health issue to know this			0
people should be handing something out at the hospital saying it 's really important that you do this with your child , have this interactive experience			0
it does n't have to be an either - or proposition - book over device			0
it would be a terrible tragedy if the art of reading to your child is lost in the digital transition .			0
