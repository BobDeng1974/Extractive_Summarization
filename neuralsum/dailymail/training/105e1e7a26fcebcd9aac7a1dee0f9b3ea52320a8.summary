by @entity0 for seven months , a @entity2 user posted a series of bizarre videos one after the other in quick succession before suddenly stopping			1
almost every clip on the @entity9 channel lasts for 11 seconds and features ten slides , each one showing a blue and red rectangle of different sizes and shapes			1
these were posted approximately every hour until three weeks ago , when they just stopped			1
however , a new video has appeared today – causing conspiracy theorists to speculate on what the clips are			2
the clips , pictured , began appearing on @entity22 's account in september			1
they were posted every hour or so for seven months , stopped three weeks ago , before a new clip appeared today			1
each upload features blue and red rectangles , and reports believe they were uploaded in @entity28 @entity29 from @entity30 used the @entity32 platform to discover two videos that suggest the user is from @entity28			1
these videos were the only ones in the collection that did n’t follow the usual formula ; the first was a cartoon clip from @entity41 , which is only viewable in @entity28			2
the second was a film of the @entity45 light show followed by a brief shot of a person ’s face with the description : ‘ @entity50 is highly intelligent			0
’ these marry up with the fact the videos use the colours of the @entity28 flag			2
the spy part of the theory comes from the similarity the videos have with numbers stations used during the @entity61			2
numbers station are shortwave radio frequencies used to post unusual code - style broadcasts			1
the broadcasts were made using typically female voices often created by speech synthesis			0
it is widely assumed they were used to send encrypted messages to spies			0
@entity74 reader @entity73 was among the first to suggest the videos were a code of some sorts			0
@entity73 said they were modern - day equivalents of the radio ‘ numbers stations ’ used during the @entity61			1
a numbers station is a shortwave radio frequency used to post unusual broadcasts of lists of numbers or morse code - style messages			1
they were first used shortly after the @entity88 and the broadcasts were made using typically female voices , often created by speech synthesis , and transmitted in a range of languages			0
it is widely assumed they were used to send encrypted messages to spies			0
in addition to the changing shapes and sizes of the rectangles , each @entity2 clip has a soundtrack of different notes that change pitch			0
taking it a step further , @entity29 from @entity30 used the @entity2 platform to discover that two of the videos suggest the user is from @entity28			1
these videos were the only ones in the collection that did n’t follow the usual formula ; the first was a cartoon clip from @entity41 , which is only viewable in @entity28			2
in addition to the changing shapes and sizes of the rectangles , each @entity2 clip on the account , pictured , has a soundtrack of different notes that change pitch			2
wired magazine was the first to report on the clips in february the second was a film of the @entity45 light show followed by a brief shot of a person ’s face and the description : ‘ @entity50 is highly intelligent			0
’ these marry up with the fact the videos use the colours of the @entity28 flag , and some theorists have suggested it could have been used as a way of @entity28 spies to communicate			1
wired magazine was the first to report on the clips in february			0
soon after readers began to suggest @entity22 was related in some way to the @entity146 tool used to test websites			0
a @entity74 reader was among the first to suggest the videos were a code and claimed the clips , pictured , resembled modern - day ‘ numbers station ’ used during the @entity61 supposedly by spies to send secret messages			1
links to @entity28 led reports to suggest the spies were @entity28 a numbers station is a shortwave radio frequency used to post unusual broadcasts of lists of numbers or morse code - style messages			1
the broadcasts were made using typically female voices often created by speech synthesis and morse generators , like the one pictured , in a range of languages but a member of the development team has since denied these claims			0
another theory suggests the channel could be a code breaking challenge in which difficult puzzles are created by anonymous groups , designed to test and recruit cryptographers			0
the first 420 videos are entitled ‘ aqua ’ before the names switch to a mix of number and letters , such as ‘ tmput21k0 ’ – the first code posted on 1 october 2013			0
@entity188 has attempted to contact @entity189 using his @entity191 account .			0

*unexplained* clips appeared on @entity22 's account in september
clips were posted for seven months , stopped three weeks ago but then started again today
each upload has 10 slides with blue and red rectangles of different shapes
a @entity30 report has suggested the videos were likely uploaded in @entity28
theorists claim it could be a modern - day equivalent of a numbers station used by spies during the @entity61
