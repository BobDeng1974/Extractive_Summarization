by @entity0 published : 19:53 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 19:53 est , 4 january 2013 police are to be issued with equipment that will enable them to test instantly whether a driver is under the influence of drugs			2
the kit will analyse a mouth swab for traces of cannabis , meaning officers will not need to wait for a doctor to do a blood test on a suspect			1
initially the equipment will be available only in police stations , but the @entity17 hopes to introduce a roadside kit			0
instant results : a new kit will allow police to test drivers for being under the influence of cannabis - similar to the breathalyser already used to test alcohol levels a test for other drugs , such as heroin , cocaine and crystal meth , is also being developed			1
at least 49 deaths and 640 accidents were caused by drivers using both illegal and medicinal drugs in 2011			0
the true figure is thought to be much higher , however , because of the difficulty in detecting whether a motorist has used drugs			0
driving under the influence of drugs is not an offence unless police can prove the driver ’s judgment was impaired			1
but @entity46 has vowed to make drug - driving a crime			1
on the spot test : the kit analyses a mouth swab for traces of the drug ( stock image ) legislation is expected to be brought in making it an automatic offence to have levels of certain drugs in the bloodstream			1
offenders will face up to six months in jail and a fine of up to £ 5,000 as well as an automatic driving ban of at least 12 months			0
the new test – developed by the @entity66 - based firm @entity65 – will instantly tell police if it detects @entity68 , the active ingredient in cannabis			2
a positive saliva test would mean officers could ask a suspect for a blood sample without first seeking medical approval			0
this would be needed as evidence to support a prosecution can come only from a blood specimen .			0
