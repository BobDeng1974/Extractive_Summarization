standing in a loose circle with hands raised , a group of around five dozen adults recite an oath to be the best adoptive parent in the world			2
then , when their word is given , they scramble around the room to find their perfect baby			0
meet the @entity17 collectors , a group of avid fans of the chubby - cheeked @entity14 dolls , who assemble at @entity16 , the birthplace of @entity17 , to snag a limited - edition , hand - stitched newborn			1
@entity16 in @entity21 , @entity22 , has been the home of @entity17 since 1978 when @entity24 , a young artist from the area , created the fabric dolls that went on to become a worldwide phenomenon			1
nestled in the foothills of the north @entity22 mountains , @entity16 looks like a nice @entity31 - style home and offers tours as well as all kinds of ' babies ' for ' adoption ' to the super fans			1
@entity16 in @entity21 , @entity22 , has been the home of @entity17 since 1978 when @entity24 , a young artist from the area , created the fabric dolls that went on to become a worldwide phenomenon @entity40 ( left ) and @entity41 ( right ) are both ' licensed patch nurses ' who work at the hospital where collectors flock to ' adopt ' the dolls inside the hospital the patch nurses assists with the delivery of @entity17 beneath the @entity50 but this is not your average toy factory			1
inside , @entity54 sits at the base of a @entity50 waiting to receive visitors , most of whom are adults who have travelled for hours , if not days , to meet her and hopefully take home a squidgy new addition to their family			1
when the crystals at the base of the tree begin to glow and an announcement comes over the loudspeaker that @entity54 is dilated , visitors gather to watch a baby being delivered			1
a nurse gives @entity54 a small dose of ' @entity71 ' to help loosen her leaves and a large dose of tender loving care , or @entity75 , and then leads onlookers in breathing exercises before pulling a naked doll from the leaves			1
the @entity16 website describes the visitor experience : ' @entity54 is always on display beneath the branches of the @entity50			1
pollinated by fanciful @entity85 , our magical @entity17 is tended by our @entity86			2
' @entity16 is the only place in the world where you can witness the birth of a hand - sculpted @entity17			1
with thousands of @entity17 throughout the hospital , you are sure to find your perfect match			1
take the oath of adoption and your new baby will give you unconditional love			0
' instead of buying the dolls , shoppers pay for an adoption certificate as well as reciting an oath to be the best adoptive parent in the world newer hand - stitched babies start at about $ 225 , but older ones such as these three original @entity14 dolls held by @entity105 from circa 1980 , can sell for tens of thousands of dollars admission to the hospital is free and ' babies ' are born throughout the year , but the company also organises extra special collectors events			1
at the recent limited edition @entity113 collection some people had trouble choosing			0
' i have to like the face , ' collector @entity116 said			0
' that 's the first thing i look at			0
' ' and the hairstyle , ' her husband , @entity120 , added			0
' the hair and the outfit , it has to go together , ' his wife agreed			0
for others , it 's a bit more abstract			0
' it 's the personality and the look of the baby because we come in here , and some draw us to them and some do n't , ' said @entity138 , another collector			0
' it 's the baby that picks us out			0
' on this particular day , six called out to @entity138 and her husband , @entity141 , who travelled from northern @entity142			0
at home , they have a collection of about 2,500			0
admission to the hospital is free and ' babies ' are born throughout the year , but the company also organises extra special collectors events @entity138 from @entity142 is one of the hundreds of fans who attended the ' birth ' of the recent @entity113 collection at the hospital			2
' it 's the baby that picks us out , ' she explains each collector has particular reason for their choice of @entity17 and while everyone is clearly focused on getting the baby they want , there 's no pushing or shoving or fighting over individual babies — unlike in 1983 when production was overwhelmed by demand for the mass - produced version of the soft dolls and fights over the toys broke out			1
' everybody respects everybody else , ' said @entity176			0
' when one person sees a baby they like , then the other person will back away			0
' @entity181 has passed her love of @entity17 on to her 24 - year - old daughter , @entity184 , and the two have more than a thousand dolls			1
they make the trip from @entity21 , @entity188 , to @entity16 general several times a year			2
collectors sometimes have a hard time explaining their passion to friends			2
@entity193 endured a bit of teasing about his hobby before retiring several years ago from his job as a sheriff 's lieutenant			0
' they used to laugh until they found out how the value is of the older babies , ' he said with a chuckle			2
@entity204 , of @entity205 , @entity22 , takes photos to send to a friend of @entity17 she 's considering adopting			2
some of the dolls are available on a payment plan as they are so expensive collector @entity204 , of @entity205 , @entity22 , drives off with her @entity17 strapped in to the front seat that she picked up at the collector 's convention @entity214 , right , a ' licensed patch nurse , ' gives the thumbs - up to @entity216 , 9 , of @entity217 , @entity218 , while checking an x-ray of the vital signs of her @entity17 at @entity16 @entity222 , centre , and husband @entity221 , right , both of @entity225 , @entity226 , compare @entity17 with @entity227 , left , of @entity228 , @entity229 newer hand - stitched babies start at about $ 225 ( about £ 144 ) , but dolls dating to before the mass - market frenzy can sell for tens of thousands of dollars			1
during their trip for the most recent collectors ' event in november , the @entity233 also picked up @entity237 , a baby from 1978 that they 'd paid for using ' @entity238 , ' a payment plan for more expensive dolls			1
but what keeps these collectors making several trips a year to @entity16 is the tight friendships they 've formed with other collectors who share their passion			1
the @entity247 , who also used to travel from @entity188 for the seasonal collector events , now live an hour away			2
' the main reason we moved here is because of @entity16 , ' @entity250 said			2
and while they love all the babies in their collections , each collector has a favorite			0
for @entity260 , it 's a @entity261 edition from 1980 hand - signed by @entity17 creator @entity24 that she adopted over the summer			1
' he 's my oldest one and he is so tiny , ' she said			0
' that 's my pride and joy right there			0
