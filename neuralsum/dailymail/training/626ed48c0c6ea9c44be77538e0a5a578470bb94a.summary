if you 've left your @entity2 shopping until the last minute , the place to go for the best bargains this year is undoubtedly @entity5 , with astonishing savings on leading brands due to the collapse of the @entity10 rouble			1
on a range of glittering potential gifts , we found savings of thousands of pounds compared with @entity16 high streets thanks to the @entity17 effect - and , what 's even better , you can be there and back before @entity21			0
savvy shoppers could be coming home with some of the most sought after items of the year - including those all - important @entity26 toys , @entity27 and even @entity29 bracelets - while saving themselves almost £ 37,000			1
@entity5 's stores are currently putting the savings on offer during @entity34 to shame , with visitors to the country able to take advantage of prices which have remained unchanged since before the rouble 's drop in value			1
but it comes with a stark warning : analysts believe the country is on the brink of a recession , and @entity10 have been bulk - buying imported products ahead of the current prices rising - which has already started to happen			1
parents can grab a bargain by travelling to @entity5 to buy the latest frozen goodies : these miniature figurines cost £ 5.82 less than they do in the @entity16 significant savings can also be made on this @entity56 camera - which costs just 2,970 as opposed to £ 4,769 in the @entity16 - and @entity57 , which costs £ 4,660 less in @entity5 there are also plenty of savings to be made if you fancy a new tv this december - this @entity58 costs £ 162 less in @entity5 than it does in @entity64 even flights appear to have dropped in price : we found a return trip to @entity5 on sunday , december 21 , returning on tuesday , december 23 , for £ 199 with @entity69			1
the falling rouble also means you will be able to stay at some of the country 's top hotels for a third of the cost before the drop			1
previously , staying at a five - star hotel would set you back £ 300 + a night			0
but , according to @entity84 , two nights at the iconic and luxurious @entity79 - where rooms boasts panoramic views of the city 's historic centre - will set you back just £ 89 at the moment			2
the historic @entity86 , close to the @entity87 and also @entity88 the headquarters of the former @entity90 , is offering two nights for £ 158			0
for a view of the @entity93 , you could opt for the @entity94 - where @entity95 lived after the @entity96 in 1917 - for £ 173 for two nights			0
back in @entity16 , two nights at the @entity79 on @entity98 will set you back somewhere in the region of £ 235.75			0
flights with @entity69 to @entity5 cost £ 199 next week - cheaper than many train tickets in @entity16 the prices of top hotels have also dropped considerably since the rouble 's troubles - staying at the @entity79 will cost just £ 89 for two nights and then there 's the cost of the goods in the shops			1
for example , toys based on this year 's hit cartoon @entity26 are significantly cheaper : you can get @entity114 and her castle for just £ 25.50 , instead of an eye - watering £ 44.99			1
you can also save more than £ 5 on a set of the popular characters , which are selling for just £ 17.17 in the @entity10 city			1
savings can also be made when grabbing a few gifts for the teenagers			0
the latest @entity125 , for example , is just £ 243 , as opposed to £ 319 in the @entity16			0
among the other bargains on offer is the prestigious @entity129 camera , at £ 4679 in @entity16 - found by @entity130 on sale in @entity5 for £ 2970 , a saving of £ 1709			1
another is the @entity135 6 @entity134 39 mm , with a @entity16 price of £ 8,250			0
this luxury accessory is available in @entity5 for just £ 4,590			2
for women , the @entity138 is retailed in @entity16 for £ 4,495.00 while in @entity10 it is on offer for a more affordable £ 2,532			2
or the steel and ceramic diamond @entity142 from @entity135 sells for £ 1,995 in @entity16 , compared with £ 1,020			0
fancy some @entity29 for @entity2 ? the @entity146 @entity145 is for sale at £ 47,800 in @entity16 , while it was shown in @entity10 this week thanks to the rouble collapse			1
more modestly , the @entity149 which retails for £ 20,800 in @entity16 was priced at £ 14,891 in @entity10 due to @entity17 's sinking currency			1
our @entity5 bargain - hunters also found a @entity154 bias cut military dress selling for £ 56.22 - compared to £ 1,690 in @entity16			2
from the same brand , a @entity158 watch priced at £ 1,200 in @entity64 is selling in @entity5 for £ 698			2
@entity149 is £ œ5 , 909 cheaper in @entity5 than it is in the @entity16 while buying @entity29 's @entity160 in @entity5 will save you £ œ13 , 489 on the asking price in @entity16 with other brands the savings were not so great but still significant			1
for example , a rope detail tweed @entity166 dress costing £ 1,475 in the @entity16 was listed as £ 999 in @entity5			2
a floral printed silk skirt on sale for £ 920 pounds in @entity16 retails currently for £ 771 in @entity5			2
however , taking advantage of these bargains is n't quite as simple as just hopping on a plane			0
@entity16 citizens travelling to @entity10 do need a visa , and this must be obtained before travelling			0
luckily , this can be got on an express service - meaning you can get your visa within two working days			0
the standard service takes six working day			0
the collapse of the rouble triggered a spending spree the value of the rouble has tumbled on the back of the falling oil price and worries about the outlook for the @entity10 economy			1
the price of oil has plummeted in the last few months - which has hit @entity10 hard , as those two items account for 70 per cent of @entity10 exports and half of government revenues			1
but @entity10 has also had to contend with being hammered by sanctions imposed by the @entity200 over its land grab in @entity203			0
the two things combined have seen the value of the rouble half			0
this time last year , £ 1 would get you about 53 roubles			0
at the close of the markets on tuesday , it would have got you more than 121 roubles			0
there has been a bit of a recovery since that peak , with the rouble now hovering around 93 to the pound			0
but the shops have yet to catch up : the prices are still about the same as they were last year - meaning your pound is now going far further in @entity10			1
however , this is likely to be short - lived : @entity10 have been rushing to the shops to stock up on imported goods before the prices go up			1
already , @entity227 and @entity228 have started to up prices to reflect the change in the exchange rate .			2

a fall in oil prices has hit @entity10 's currency hard
@entity237 is now worth almost twice as much in @entity5 as it was a year *ago*
but prices on imported goods from the likes of @entity227 have yet to increase
@entity244 toys are as much as £ 25 cheaper , @entity27 are £ 73 less and £ œ13 , 489 off a @entity29 bracelet
but analysts warn the country is at risk of falling into recession
