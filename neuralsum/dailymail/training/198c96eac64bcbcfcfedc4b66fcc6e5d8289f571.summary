by @entity0 and @entity1 fears are growing that the @entity3 is headed for an epidemic of monstrous rodents as pictures of giant rats continue to emerge			1
one image , reportedly reportedly taken in @entity9 , shows a giant rat being held up by its tail - and the man holding it is 6ft 1in , giving a sense of its horrifying scale			1
it comes as a giant rat was caught in @entity17 , measuring two feet long from its nose to its tail			1
ridiculous rodent : this photo shows a huge rat that was caught in @entity9 earlier this year			1
it measured 50cm from tail to nose pest control experts today warned that similar rats are likely to become more common in the @entity3 as more households get careless about how they throw out their rubbish , and discard left - over fast food meanwhile a shocking photo of a massive rat in @entity34 , @entity35 , has also emerged			1
the picture , showing the seemingly - dead vermin on a pink spade , appears to have been taken next to a river			0
the pictures were tweeted by @entity41 during a discussion on the @entity43 show about ' giant mutant rats '			2
river rat : this giant vermin was reportedly found in @entity34 , @entity35 the menacing super rat in @entity17 was caught on an industrial estate by a pest controller from @entity50 , one of the country 's largest independent pest prevention companies			1
@entity50 has offices in @entity55 , @entity17 and @entity56 and all locations report a rise in the number of super rats spotted			2
pest control experts today warned that similar rats are likely to become more common in the @entity3 as more households get careless about how they throw out their rubbish , and discard left - over fast food			1
@entity66 of pest control registry basis @entity68 said during the @entity70 break offices need to ensure they are protected from rat infestations which can cause millions of pounds worth of damage in buildings			1
once inside , with nobody about to stop them , they can start gnawing desks , furniture and coffee machines , building nests to set up colonies , he said			0
we found you : this huge rodent had to be removed by hand from the ceiling after the trap failed to work due to its size in @entity89 ' rats are intelligent creatures able to adapt and replenish their numbers very quickly , and anywhere that offers a dry space with little human traffic is ideal , ' he said			1
' the potential for an infestation will increase over the holiday period when there are plenty of idle offices , factories and warehouses			0
' owners must do all they can to keep their premises pest - free while staff are away on holiday and the place is closed down			2
' ' business premises are at particular risk over the @entity70 holiday period as most are not being used			0
' if they manage to get in , the rats can cause a lot of damage to equipment and electrics as well as valuable stock and they also carry diseases			2
experts also warn that the rodents are becoming increasingly resistant to poison			1
experts say the conventional blood - thinning poison used to kill the rats is not working as it used to			1
now pest controllers are calling on the government to tighten up its response to the monster - size vermin and asking the @entity130 to approve stronger ‘ third generation poison ’ to kill them			1
@entity135 pest controller @entity133 from @entity50 told @entity136 : ‘ we ’re seeing an upsurge in rat call - outs , it ’s gone up significantly by about 15 per cent over the past year			1
‘ it ’s been very good for us			0
but i ’m not entirely sure what ’s causing it , it could be the weather , it ’s been very cold and it ’s been very wet			0
‘ they ’re twice as large as they once were			0
it ’s definitely not uncommon to see rats the size of a cat			1
‘ the problem is that they ’re feeding more than they used to			0
they ’re feeding off leftover junk food that we throw away			0
‘ if there is vermin , 99.9 per cent of the time it ’s our fault			0
we ’re basically feeding them and they get used to it			0
so they keep coming around us to get more food , ' he added			0
mr @entity133 said : ‘ the rats that we ’re seeing in the city used to be the ones roaming round the countryside , in agriculture , out on farms , but they ’ve migrated to towns – now they live in the city			2
' growing problem : cities throughout the @entity3 are seeing more super rats as the rodents gorge on food left out in bins mr @entity133 said the ' monster rats ' are in every town throughout the country but there has been an increase in sightings in @entity17 , @entity190 and @entity55			1
during the 1960s onwards , rat poison was based on the blood - thinning agent warfarin			2
it worked by draining the blood from the rat and killing it			0
today , pest controllers use bromadiolone , but both are proving to be ineffective on some monster vermin			1
‘ we find that the rats are becoming resistant to poison , ' mr @entity133 said			2
' we used to use warfarin when i first started out 23 years ago			0
it was the first generation of rat poisoning and used to work but does n't do much now			0
' we need new , stronger poisons as they 've grown used to what we use			0
' the pest controller explained that in an area between @entity211 and @entity212 the poisons simply do not work at all , while rats in @entity55 have also developed a higher immunity			2
mr @entity133 is calling on the government to create a ' rat tsar ' to tackle the problem			2
he also wants the @entity130 to approve the third generation of rat poison to help tackle the problem , but plans for stronger poison face stiff opposition from campaigners amid fears that it could be harmful to humans			1
wildlife campaigners have also raised concerns that it could wreak havoc on animal and birds			0
however , pest control experts warn that there will be even more monster rats found if they are allowed to feast on food near junk food shops , restaurants and household bin areas outside blocks of flats			1
big rodent : the giant monster rat was found in a family residence in @entity245 , south @entity89 last week rats thrive in damp and soggy weather - of which the @entity3 has seen plenty during the wettest year on record			1
vermin are also swapping rural areas for the big city			0
the government ’s austerity measures have been blamed for making the problem far worse – after cuts to the budget for pest control			0
and rats can carry illnesses which can be passed to humans , including @entity262 ’s disease , which has flu - like symptoms initially but can lead to jaundice and kidney failure			0
across the country , councils have reported a rise in the number of rats being reported			2
@entity190 has the highest number of call - outs with 5,100 in the past year			0
and the problem is not just confined to @entity3			2
other huge rodents have been caught recently in homes in @entity276 and @entity89 , where one rat was trapped by pest control after terrorising an @entity280 family in south @entity89			1
the @entity89 - based ' monster vermin ' had been terrorising @entity283 and @entity284 ’ home in @entity245 shortly after they moved into their new flat			0
one for supper : @entity287 , owned by @entity289 resident @entity288 , caught one of the large rats whose numbers are increasing around the country			1
