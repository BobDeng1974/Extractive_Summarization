@entity0 may still be grieving the recent loss of @entity3 ’s beloved pet labrador @entity4			1
but at @entity10 , real - life setting for the @entity9 drama , the lady of the house can still turn to her loyal dogs for protection from ghosts and ghouls			1
the @entity15 relied on her own six hounds to safeguard her on @entity17 night from the spirits that haunt her home , she has revealed in her blog , alongside a photograph of her canine guard of honour			1
‘ the dogs were all quite thrilled as we made our way along the corridors			2
‘ they had no idea about my superstitious date but as i drew the curtains , they happily sprawled out			0
’ hours earlier , the @entity15 had deeply unsettled herself by recalling stories of past ghostly goings on at @entity10			1
she wrote : ‘ i ended up swapping ghost stories with @entity47 , our decorator , who was telling me about the passage and stairs where she and her father saw a ghost ( a woman ) and the heavy doors that , although shut , swing open			0
‘ most of the staff have a story or two			0
@entity59 , our head housekeeper , has spotted a few spooky goings on and @entity61 , our castle manager , regularly hears footsteps walking along a corridor when locking up at night			0
’ she added : ‘ my husband is quite unaffected and pragmatic , but does inquire every so often if we need another priest or whether we are managing			0
he will not have six dogs upstairs			2
’ @entity15 said that her dogs , pictured , keep the ghosts away from her @entity10 home @entity0 ’s millions of loyal viewers should be braced for the @entity9 series to take a supernatural turn if @entity15 has any influence on the show ’s creator @entity75			1
she wrote : ‘ @entity75 has not yet introduced ghosts in @entity0 – we have had deaths , murders , suicides and plenty of illness			1
perhaps this time next year ? ’ the @entity15 admits , however , that the dogs were perhaps not the most reliable of guards			2
she wrote : ‘ during the night , they turned and got up , whimpering as they presumably dreamt of happy games of tag , and leaping into ponds			0
‘ i did not sleep particularly well and had just drifted off when @entity92 ( who is well named ) decided to leap on top of the bed , wanting an immediate cuddle			0
