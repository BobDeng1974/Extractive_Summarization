in a short documentary about the gastronomic journey directed by @entity51 , @entity20 details how what began as a hobby turned into an obsession as he slaved away trying to create each dish the way in was prepared in the restaurant			1
at times @entity20 recounted feeling inadequate and he pointed to one recipe involving a gel swirl that kept falling apart try after try			0
to make the dish work he felt as though he ' cheated ' by having to add more gel in order to get it to hold			0
@entity20 emailed chef @entity14 with a question about the dish who then kindly invited him to fly to @entity8 for a demo on how to make the challenging swirl			1
