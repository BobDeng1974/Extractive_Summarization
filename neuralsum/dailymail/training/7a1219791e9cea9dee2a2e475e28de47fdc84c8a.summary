@entity1 manager @entity0 has criticised @entity3 's treatment of his former assistant @entity4 , while defender @entity5 has called for the @entity6 to make a hasty return to his previous position			1
@entity4 left his post as @entity0 's deputy to become the @entity12 ' new head coach at the end of last month but was out of a job within just eight days as the club 's owners made the baffling decision to replace him with @entity18 - their fourth boss of the season			1
in his brief time in charge , the former @entity22 international took four points from two games and @entity0 struggled to hide his frustration at @entity29 's circumstances			1
@entity4 ( above ) was replaced as @entity3 manager after just eight days in the job @entity1 manager @entity0 ( centre ) is outraged at the treatment of @entity29 ' i 'm very disappointed for him , and really i think @entity3 have to look at themselves , ' he told @entity34			1
' @entity4 's not done anything untoward there - he went in in difficult circumstances , got a win and a draw and suddenly finds himself out of work again which is very poor			1
' there 's a human aspect to football as well and i think the owners , technical directors and chief executives need to consider that when they 're playing with people 's lives in this way			1
' @entity0 has been preparing @entity1 for saturday 's @entity52 qualifier against the @entity53 and the trip to @entity55 three days later			1
it is the first time he has worked with the squad without @entity4 's input , with @entity61 @entity60 elite performance director @entity59 and youth team coach @entity62 helping out on this occasion			2
both men already have long - term projects in hand meaning @entity0 's previous number two could feasibly be back in his old post in time for november 's trip to @entity70			1
and @entity5 , who spent several years working with @entity4 during the pair 's time at @entity73 , would welcome him with open arms			2
@entity4 had made a decent start at @entity76 , winning one and drawing one of his two games in charge former @entity81 and @entity82 midfielder @entity18 has taken over from @entity4 ' i do n't know what the situation is with @entity4 but he was great working with us and personally i would like to see him come back , ' said the @entity88 man			1
' that 's nothing against @entity59 and @entity90 but i would like to see him back with us			0
he was doing a good job here and obviously i know him well from my time with @entity73			0
' i 've not spoken to him but i think @entity0 has , to see what his situation is			2
' i would just like to see him back			0
' @entity0 has been fully focused on the matches ahead and was more equivocal than @entity5 when asked if @entity4 would slot back in			2
he would likely prefer a commitment until the end of the current campaign from the next appointee while @entity4 , having had the briefest of tastes , may now be minded to persevere finding work as a number one			2
@entity5 worked with former @entity3 manager @entity4 during his time at @entity73 ' that 's something that 's really not for now , ' said @entity0			1
' we 've kept communication going over the week and that 's something we can address down the line			0
' @entity5 , meanwhile , has spoken of his satisfaction at the style of football @entity1 have been attempting to play under @entity0			1
the 32 - year - old has more than a decade of international football under his belt and was part of the side that came close to a first ever @entity121 appearance under @entity122 six years ago			0
whether or not @entity0 can take the squad one step better remains to be seen but @entity5 is happy with the way they are trying			0
' every manager has different ways of playing ... with @entity122 i would say we would lump it a bit more			0
stick it in the channel , get after it , work hard , ' he said			0
' now we 're trying to play a bit more , you can see that in the performance and the goals we scored when we beat @entity140 last month			0
' you do n't want to be known for kicking it long			0
sometimes that does work but a lot of the players are used to playing at a good level with our clubs and passing on the floor			0
' we want to bring that to @entity1 too			0

@entity4 left his post as @entity1 no 2 to take over at @entity3
@entity4 picked up four points from two games yet was replaced by former @entity81 midfielder @entity18 after just eight days
@entity1 manager @entity0 says treatment of @entity4 was ' very poor ' , adding : ' there 's a human aspect to football '
