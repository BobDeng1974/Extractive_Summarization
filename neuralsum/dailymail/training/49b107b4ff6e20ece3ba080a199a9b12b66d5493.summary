by @entity1 reporter while @entity3 has n't made many headlines since becoming the ' spoiled @entity6 teenager ' who took teenage angst to a whole new level by trying to divorce her mom and dad back in march , it does n't mean she 's stopped living life on her own terms			1
now the 18 - year - old who wanted to have her cake and eat it , too , has finished out the senior year she fought so hard to force her parents to pay for in a blaze of glory befitting the headlines she won back in march			1
when her parents refused to cough up for the icing , the syrupy sweet cheerleader hauled them into court to keep the honey flowing			0
she 's since dropped the case and moved home again , while apparently keeping the boyfriend who court docs show was the reason behind their domestic strife			0
and if the party did n't stop then , it certainly was n't going to end as @entity30 edged ever closer to senior prom , graduation and her future as a college student free from the influence of her mother and former @entity38 , @entity6 police chief father			1
graduation ! litigious cheerleader @entity3 dropped her lawsuit against her parents in march after a judge all but scoffed at her for wanted to live apart from her parents while forcing them to pay her private high school tuition prom ! senior prom appeared like the time of @entity3 's ( far right ) life , though whose cashed she used for the fairy - like dress remained a mystery day to remember : @entity3 ( right ) was dressed like the princess she was accused of being in so many headlines this spring as she attended @entity54 's senior prom in may just months after suing her own parents catholic school girl : @entity3 dropped her suit and moved back in with her parents soon after trying to get tuition out of them for the remainder of her senior year			1
here , the 18 - year - old is pictured at a court hearing , which she attended with several of her friends while wearing her catholic school uniform to be fair , the honors student would leave @entity66 with a $ 56,000 scholarship to @entity68 , enough to make one think twice before assuming she 's some parasitic princess			1
however , photos posted to her social media accounts and those of her friends since the media circus around her suit died down mostly support her parents ' court arguments that she 's just a spoiled teen with a bad news boyfriend and a new found love of partying			1
graduation was a good time for @entity30 , though she managed to sleep through her final chapel service as a catholic high schooler			0
she also who tweeted on the big day : ' i wan na be drunk when i wake up on the right side of the wrong bed			0
' did the lyrics from @entity87 singer - songwriter @entity86 reflect reality for the 18 - year - old ? parties ! @entity3 tweeted out these song lyrics on the day of graduation			2
her parents accused the teen of hard partying the led up to her leaving home			2
she 'd since moved back ion , but has the debauchery continued ? @entity97 ? the teen managed to sleep through her last chapel service as a @entity101 schooler , but the honoros student denied her behavior had changed in her march lawsuit they do if it went anything like many of her last high school days and nights , when photos reveal @entity30 and her friends drinking and partying hard			1
prom looked fun for the teen , too , though her photos from the night reveal she may not have attended on the arm of @entity118 , the boyfriend who @entity30 's parent 's disapproved of so vehemently they were willing to let their daughter leave home rather than date him			1
whether she attended with @entity125 or not , @entity3 still proudly displays a photo of the two of them on her @entity130 account			0
courtroom foes : she had sued @entity132 and @entity30 , pictured in court , after leaving home last year			2
they claimed her behavior had drastically worsened in part as a result of her dating a boy named @entity139			0
residual anger ? this month , long after the courtroom showdown that never was , @entity3 tweeted this			0
her father is a former chief of police in their town that 's where soon - to - be college freshman also had some choice words for people like her former cop father			2
' the majority of cops are such assholes , ' she tweeted			0
soon @entity3 will have all the freedom in the world to go against her parents ' wishes as her adolescence turns into adulthood			0
but when her $ 56,000 runs out at @entity161 -- where tuition , room and board cost $ 46,154 per year -- will she sue herself to cough up the cash ? they must have settled : even as she prepares to move away to @entity168 for college , the 18 - year - old is still pictured in social media with the boyfriend , @entity118 , who angered her parents so much college - bound ! @entity3 ( left at left and with the red cup at right ) is now headed to college where she 'll study biomedical engineering on a $ 56,000 scholarship			1
no word yet on who she might sue when those funds dry up			0

@entity6 teen @entity3 , 18 , sued her parents in march with claims of neglect and *abuse* while her parents said she was just acting out
she ended up dropping the suit and moving back in with her mother and former police chief father
she was immediately pictured partying hard with the very boyfriend she left home over being *banned* from dating
now the college - bound teen is moving on to the next phase of her life thanks to a $ 56,000 scholarship
but she was n't going to leave home before partying it at prom and graduation
