share what you think the comments below have been moderated in advance			0
@entity145 , @entity146 , 1 day ago why does it matter if it was a woman or a man ? ? @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , 1 day ago in @entity152 , fuel taxes solely pay for the roads , that are designed for cars and trucks , period			0
these freeriders belong in a public park designed for bicycles or on private property			0
it is n't fair to anyone that they are out on the highway and it is rather dangerous as we can see here			0
while i feel terrible for the victims of this accident , it was entirely preventable			0
it is high time for some common sense bicycle laws			0
perhaps they should be licensed , taxed and forced to comply with the same rules cars and truck are of they want to share the road with vehicles weighing multiple tons			0

just horrible for the people involved ! @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity152 , 1 day ago " crossed over into the northbound lane and struck the four bicyclists " and @entity4 has n't been charged ? ummm ... how about failing to keep to the right ? failure to stay in the proper lane ? failure to maintain control of the vehicle ? that 's just for starters			1
