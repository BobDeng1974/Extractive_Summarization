by @entity0 published : 05:20 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 08:15 est , 20 september 2013 @entity1 has unveiled a range of measures after admitting bloated management structures at the @entity5 can ' stifle creativity ' it probably seemed like a good idea at the time going ' back to the floor ' to reconnect with rank and file @entity5 staff			0
but the reality of working as a ' runner ' on a frantic saturday night live show maybe quite a lot trickier than £ 300,000 - a - year director @entity16 imagined			1
the @entity5 ’s director of television has announced that he will start work as the most junior of assistants on @entity22 this autumn in a bid to address the corporation 's overly ' hierarchical structures			1
' he will also send his fellow senior managers to take up in junior roles on other shows to gain direct experience of the production process			1
@entity16 's decision to run errands on the saturday night entertainment show , which has just begun its eleventh series is part of a wider shake - up in @entity5 culture designed to ' give more status and seniority ' to creative people and revitalise the often criticised bloated ranks of management			1
despite his illustrious career with the corporation mr @entity16 admitted that he had never before held the unglamourous role of ' runner ' which in many cases amounts to that of a general dogsboddy			1
nevertheless the former @entity52 chief said he was excited at the prospect of trying out the role for the first time			0
he said : ' i did n’t do running because i started in documentary programmes and so i started as a junior researcher , i 'm really looking forward to it			0
' mr @entity16 has also voiced concerns that the @entity5 's existing structure can ' stifle creativity ' as those who involved in production are perceived as less valued than the organisation ’s managers			1
and his initiatives to re-address the balance could not come any sooner as the @entity5 faces a crisis over its senior management structure and salaries			0
just last week the payoffs awarded to departing executives became the subject of sharp criticism by the @entity76 and the @entity77			0
speaking to the @entity78 , mr @entity16 said he wanted his highly paid managers to have a ' closer understanding ' of how things actually work in production			1
he said : ' i think we senior managers should have a closer understanding of what it ’s like on the ground in production , at the coal face , making the programmes and i ’m going to encourage all my senior team to be runners and do similar things in the next few weeks			2
re-connect : mr @entity16 believes his plan to work as a runner on the popular show is the best way for senior staff to identify with those working ' at the coal face ' ' up until now in the @entity5 to get status and seniority you have had to become a manager and i want to break that philosophy and give more status and seniority to the most creative people without burdening them with everything which goes with management which can be distracting and is not the best use of their time			1
' it ’s a way of giving higher profile to creativity and ideas development and benefiting people who do n’t want to become managers but are crucial to the future of the @entity5 because they are some of our strongest creative			2
that ’s quite a big change in philosophy for us really			0
' the plans follow in a similar vein to one of the corporation 's own tv shows ' back to the @entity133 ' , in which business figures including @entity136 boss @entity135 and former @entity138 chairman @entity137 , are filmed returning to junior roles in their own companies			1
mr @entity16 also announced that he wants to assemble a team of half a dozen senior creative figures to re-energise certain parts of the organisation			1
strictly : the cast of the eleventh series of the dance programme which is on the @entity5 this autumn , @entity16 says he is looking forward to getting a chance to work on the show but critics point out that the @entity5 already has a creative director in @entity153 , who is paid £ 183,500 , plus a second salary for presenting the landmark arts strand imagine			2
the new roles will be called ' @entity158 ' and will be based in a new unit called ' @entity160			0
' they will be tasked with bringing new creative energy to under - performing areas across @entity5 networks and the director says he hopes the roles will help encourage individuals from outside the @entity5 to join the organisation			2
@entity168 graduate mr @entity16 , 38 , was appointed director of television in april with a salary package worth £ 327,800			1
previously he spent three years in charge of @entity52 before moving to @entity173 , where he has commissioned popular shows including @entity175 and @entity176			0
he has repeatedly voiced his concerns that the broadcaster has become over-reliant on middle - class viewers and is at risk of losing touch with the rest of society			0
and it seems this insistence on re-connecting will remain a common thread in his approach to his new leadership role			0
@entity16 with wife and author @entity190 , @entity168 educated mr @entity16 was appointed director of television in april this year with a salary package of £ 327,800 reflecting the much criticised management structures of the corporation he admitted that ' current structures can stifle the energy and creativity of individuals			1
' he added : ' we have been too siloed before and have risked having too hierarchical structures and the changes i have been trying to make are about releasing creative energy from those siloes and hierarchies			1
' in a further effort to shake up the big wigs an encourage those further down the corporate ladder to contribute , @entity5 staff who come up with ideas for programme formats will now see their names on the credits at the end of those programmes			0
in the past senior executives and producers have claimed credit for shows on behalf of their more junior staff			2
mr @entity16 said : ' everyone who develops an idea will get a credit , we have n’t had a consistent pattern of development credits and we are going to introduce development credits to ensure that that crucial stage in the development of a programme is properly recognised			2
' @entity16 ’s initiative , though admirable , could have been timed better coming as it does alongside an announcement by director of news and current affairs , @entity239 , that the @entity5 was to axe 75 posts in its news division			2
in a cheerless memo to staff , he said the job losses would ' add to uncertainty after what has been a trying year			0
' he said : ' i also appreciate the concern the cost savings come at a time that so many people are working hard to make the most of new technologies and striving to deliver the best journalism in the world			0
' the reality is that we have to live within the terms of the licence fee settlement			0

£ 300,000 - a - year director @entity16 , 38 , wants senior managers to *challenge* the corporation 's overly ' hierarchical structures '
he also wants to give more power to the creative talent behind *successful* shows rather than managerial ranks which he says are ' siloed '
even at the start of his career @entity168 - educated mr @entity16 never held such lowly role
