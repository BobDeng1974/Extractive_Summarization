prime minister @entity0 is set to announce a £ 15billion boost for more than 100 projects , which is expected to be completed by the end of the decade @entity0 will today embrace what @entity4 called ' the great car economy ' as he unveils plans for the biggest roadbuilding programme for almost half a century			1
the prime minister will announce a £ 15billion boost for more than 100 projects to be completed by the end of the decade , resulting in hundreds of miles of extra lanes on @entity13 's motorways and trunk roads			1
schemes include finally putting the @entity16 into a tunnel past the notorious @entity19 bottleneck , and widening the @entity21 north of @entity22 and trans - @entity24 roads in the north of @entity27			1
mr @entity0 's announcement echoes the ' roads for prosperity ' scheme unveiled by @entity4 in 1989 to boost ' the great car economy ' , which promised the largest expansion of the roads network since the @entity34			1
but many schemes were quietly abandoned in the mid- 1990s after environmental protests and spending cuts			0
addressing the @entity39 's ( @entity39 ) annual conference in @entity40 today , mr @entity0 will say the government is to set out the first - ever long term ' roads investment strategy ' for the @entity13 in chancellor @entity45 's forthcoming autumn statement			1
the programme will improve the lives of commuters and support business and enterprise across the country , he will claim			0
the scheme will be ' the biggest , boldest and most far - reaching road improvement programme in four decades ' , mr @entity0 will say			1
' this will be nothing less than a roads revolution – one which will lead to quicker journey times , more jobs , and businesses boosted			2
' the £ 15billion investment between 2015 - 16 and 2020 - 21 will be the biggest upgrade to our roads in a generation , officials say , and will take total spending on the network over the decade to £ 24billion			1
@entity89 , of the @entity90 , which promotes improved public transport said the plans ' will trash protected areas and do nothing for the economy '			0
he added : ' it makes no sense to spend billions ploughing more lanes of traffic through our @entity100 or desecrating irreplaceable historic sites like @entity19			1
' ' these schemes will make people more dependent than ever on their cars , place greater costs on the @entity107 , while failing to tackle problems like the massive backlog of pot holes blighting local roads			0
' @entity113 president @entity112 said : ' roads carry 90 oer cent of goods and people and are our biggest transport asset and so it makes perfect sense to upgrade them to help the @entity13 economy by improving journey times for people and business			1
' aa members have told us , in a new aa / @entity126 that the most important message they want conveyed to the government is ' we pay too much motoring tax yet so little is spent on the roads '			0
perhaps at long last road users are going to see more of their hard paid motoring taxes being reinvested in the road network '			0
@entity136 transport secretary @entity135 said : ' this is another pre-election con trick from @entity0			1
this desperate so - called announcement of promised road improvements includes no additional money and people simply wo n't fall for it			0
' when it comes to road investment , the truth is @entity0 leaves us like a frustrated motorist trying to get through the rush hour - we 're stuck going nowhere fast			2
' @entity0 should be judged on his record , not on a speech , and his record on road investment has been nothing but a chaotic series of u-turns			2
cutting investment , then promising to restore it after 2015			0
cancelling road schemes , like the @entity159 , then reinstating them			0
and constantly failing to meet deadlines for the completion of improvements			0
' far from taking big decisions on transport , @entity0 has dithered for five years on airport expansion and has been so slow to bring forward the @entity166 that it wo n't pass in this @entity168			2
' we know @entity0 's record on infrastructure is one of all talk and no delivery			2
infrastructure output has fallen by nearly 20 % since may 2010 and less than a third of projects in the government 's pipeline are actually classed as ' in construction '			0
' the @entity181 should back @entity183 's plan for an independent infrastructure commission to end the dither and delay on the decisions we need to take for @entity13 's future			2

@entity0 to announce £ 15billion boost for 100 projects on @entity13 roads
includes putting tunnel on @entity16 at @entity19 and widening part of the @entity21
it echoes the ' roads for prosperity ' scheme unveiled by @entity4 in 1989
