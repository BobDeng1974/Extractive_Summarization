by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:42 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:55 est , 19 december 2013 lung cancer cases are on the rise among women , despite a sharp drop for men over the past two decades			1
one woman was diagnosed for every three men back in 1990			1
but this has now doubled to two women for every three male cases , the latest figures from the @entity15 show			1
specialists say this reflects the fact many men quit smoking from the 1950s onwards			0
lung cancer cases are on the rise among women , despite a sharp drop for men over the past two years but at the same time , women started to take up the habit in large numbers , often as a way to lose weight , after being targeted by tobacco industry marketing			1
this means the true lung cancer toll for older women has taken longer to emerge			0
despite the rising number of female cases , more people are surviving the disease , particularly women			1
in 1990 , just 17 per cent of patients of both sexes lived for a year after diagnosis			1
by 2010 , this had risen to 29 per cent of men and 33 per cent of women			2
although lung cancer is known as a ‘ smoker ’s disease ’ , up to one in eight sufferers has never smoked			0
in the @entity48 , lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer death in women claiming around 16,000 lives a year compared with 12,000 from breast cancer			2
dr @entity55 of the @entity15 said : ‘ this report shows that we are gradually making inroads into improving the survival from this common cancer			2
the drop in male lung cancer reflects the numbers who quit smoking from the 1950s onwards ' the improvement in survival in lung cancer has been dramatic over the last 20 years with almost twice as many patients alive a year after diagnosis now as was the case in 1990			1
' i think this reflects a combination of the better organisation of cancer services , the availability of better treatments and earlier diagnosis			0
' our one - year survival figures show that we are now approaching the outcomes those of other countries where the survival has historically been significantly better than in @entity86			2
' however , there is much more to be done for lung cancer patients with the majority still dying within a year of diagnosis			0
' @entity90 , chief executive of the @entity91 , added : ‘ it is vitally important that women become just as aware of the symptoms of lung cancer as they are of breast cancer , as the earlier they are diagnosed the more chance they have of surviving			1
‘ so , we would urge anyone with a persistent cough or who is feeling tired and breathless to see their gp as it could just save their life			0
’ @entity104 , @entity105 's head of statistics , said ' it 's great news that lung cancer in men has fallen by more than a third since the early 1990s			0
' trends in lung cancer incidence rates reflect past trends in cigarette smoking - many men quit smoking from the 1950s onwards , so we are now seeing the positive impact of that			0
' unfortunately this smoking fall did n't occur for women until later - after they had become the core targets of the tobacco industry 's marketing strategy , so their lung cancer rates are still increasing			0
' professor @entity125 , director of health and wellbeing at @entity86 said ' smoking is one of the main causes of lung cancer , and survival , whilst improving , is very poor			0
this report shows that less than a third ( 30 per cent ) of people diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010 will survive the first year , and whilst we do not know yet how many of these will still be alive at 5 years , it is not likely to be greater than 10 or 11 per cent			1

in 1990 , one woman was diagnosed with disease for every three men
that has doubled to two women for every three male cases
latest figures from the @entity15
more people surviving disease , with 30 *%* living for year after diagnosis
