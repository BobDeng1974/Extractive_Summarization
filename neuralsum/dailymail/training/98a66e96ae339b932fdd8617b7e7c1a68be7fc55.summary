by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 will be packed to its old rafters on saturday and somewhere among the throng there will be four @entity7 appreciating @entity8			1
the @entity9 international has endeared himself to the blue half of @entity12 with his honest performances combining hard work , deft skill and an ability to pop up with a goal when it matters , but the affection for @entity8 runs deeper			1
he is not someone for whom the term ‘ typical footballer ’ could be used			0
video : scroll down for @entity8 buys tickets to donate to unemployed fans in form : @entity8 scored against @entity27 on saturday and has started the season brightly @entity8 , for starters , is an ambassador for dyslexia in @entity31 , launched an initiative some time ago to help the progress of injured ex-servicemen return to work , and he supports homeless centres in @entity36 and @entity37			1
spend time with @entity8 , 27 , and you discover he is a man with awareness and values and that explains why he became quickly attuned to the rancour surrounding the prices of tickets to watch matches in the @entity47 and the frustration that come from spiraling costs			1
so he decided to try and make a difference			2
before the beginning of this campaign , he bought four season tickets for @entity3 with the ambition to give those down on their luck a chance to get matches they would have no hope of seeing			1
the tickets will be circulated around @entity12 , with four different fans being selected for each @entity64 home match			2
it is why , when @entity68 ’s side emerge for their crucial meeting with @entity70 , there will be one particular quartet in the crowd willing on @entity8			1
charitable : @entity8 bought four season tickets to allow less privileged fans to attend matches ‘ when i got to my mid- 20s i started thinking of myself as a bit more of an established player in terms of knowing how the football world works , what ’s expected of you , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ on the other side , you know what comes with it , with all the attention on you			0
‘ social media is a massive platform with @entity91 and stuff			0
it ’s so easy to get things out			0
‘ even when that side of it was young , i would talk to mates and say you could literally write anything on there and within three or four days everyone would know about it			0
‘ so we got thinking of what we could do that could make a difference to various charities and it was pretty simple really			2
' the price of football is getting more expensive and more and more fans , who would probably have gone for years , were struggling to go any more			0
' deja vu : @entity8 scored against @entity70 last season and will hope to do the same on saturday ‘ but without being able to just go and pick people , and not knowing if you ’d picked the right ones , we decided to speak to the job centres in the local areas — they would know who was working hard to get back into employment and maybe had a few setbacks and could do with a morale - booster			1
‘ it ’s worked really well			0
we spoke to the people who went to the first game and they were delighted , they said it made a really big difference to them			2
it ’s good to hear it			0
prices ca n’t get out of hand because we are losing the spine of what football is all about			0
’ though he initially struggled to adjust to the @entity47 — he says he was ‘ in awe ’ of players like @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 — @entity8 has blossomed in the last 12 months and it was against @entity70 last season that his @entity64 career really took off			1
improving : @entity8 scored 10 goals for @entity64 last season and is already off the mark this campaign his header secured a 1 - 0 victory , gave @entity68 his first win and set the ball rolling for them to return to @entity152			1
@entity70 are likely to prove a different proposition to the out - of - sorts bunch that arrived last year but they will have to contain a forward whose confidence is on the up			1
‘ last year there was a lot more uncertainty about how we were going to play and shape up because the manager was new , ’ says @entity8			2
‘ this time the start of the season has been more of a disappointment rather than not understanding the system			2
we ’ve thrown four points away			0
’ should they play as they did for 60 minutes against @entity27 last week , though , @entity70 will certainly have issues to deal with and @entity8 is relishing the prospect of working in tandem with @entity173 and @entity174			1
new kid in town : @entity8 is relishing the chance to link up with @entity173 , who signed on wednesday ‘ @entity173 is a player with a massive pedigree , ’ he says			2
‘ maybe he ’s getting older but he still has a wealth of knowledge that could definitely be passed on			0
‘ as for @entity182 , it will be a funny day for him			0
this is probably the first season he is going to get that he can show them what he is made of			0
