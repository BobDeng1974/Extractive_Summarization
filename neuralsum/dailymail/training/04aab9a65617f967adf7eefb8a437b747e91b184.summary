by @entity0 dredging up the past : @entity2 is in the lead for the @entity6 lt governor 's race but is now dealing with the revelation that he was treated for depression in the 1980s a state senator in @entity10 whose medical history was released amid a dirty campaign for lieutenant governor has admitted that he was checked into a psychiatric hospital for treatment			1
state senator @entity2 's team has released a statement saying that he was treated for mild depression and diagnosed with a chemical imbalance in the early 1980s			1
the confirmation comes as @entity2 's campaign accuses their opponent , @entity22 , of leaking records of a deposition where @entity2 admits to his stay in the psychiatric hospital			1
in the deposition , @entity2 claimed that he was not at @entity28 for psychiatric or emotional problems but ' for rest '			1
he was later admitted to @entity31 in @entity32 and was treated for ' rest , fatigue , exhaustion , ' according to local station @entity36			2
@entity2 also confirmed that he took an antidepressant called @entity38 for a few years in the 1980s to treat the chemical imbalance			1
the deposition dates back to 1989 , but does not give specific dates of when @entity2 's treatment occurred			2
his testimony was part of a 1987 slander lawsuit @entity2 filed against the @entity47 newspaper , which no longer exists			0
' this has not been a secret ; for years on his radio station , he has regularly talked about depression and discussed the importance of early treatment when dealing with depression , ' campaign spokesman @entity48 said in the statement released to the @entity57			0
playing dirty : incumbent lt governor @entity22 reportedly did not release the information but he does n't pretend not to benefit from the questions about his opponent 's mental health ' he has done this to help others and remove any social stigma for those who seek or are considering seeking treatment			2
he has conducted several interviews with @entity10 journalists on the subject			0
none felt inclined to write the story			0

for his part , @entity22 did little to tamper the speculation that he was somehow involved in the release of the deposition - or at least that he benefitted from the information being public			0
