by @entity0 published : 18:53 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 02:39 est , 25 july 2013 commons speaker @entity1 is ‘ pushing hard ’ to recall mps from their summer holidays if @entity4 dies this august - at a cost to taxpayers of more than £ 40,000			1
mps , officials and government sources say mr @entity1 is ‘ bursting ’ to recall @entity10 to pay tribute to the former @entity13 leader			1
but his enthusiasm for a recall - which would be unprecedented for a foreign leader - has irritated some mps			1
bursting : speaker @entity1 is said to be ' pushing hard ' for a recall of @entity10 if @entity4 should die while it is in recess			1
the move is said to have irritated some mps they believe mr @entity1 is seeking ‘ penitence ’ for his membership , in the 1980s , of the ultra-right wing @entity24 and the @entity26 which both disparaged mr @entity4 ’s fight for freedom			1
the speaker has denied claims that he once wore a t - shirt emblazoned with the slogan ‘ @entity38 ’ but the shirts , and stickers , were manufactured when he was a member of the @entity26 , which was shut down by @entity40 high command in 1986 when he was chairman			1
mr @entity1 was also secretary of the monday club ’s @entity41 , which called for immigrants to be sent back to their country of origin			2
@entity46 said in 2011 that the @entity24 , of whom @entity1 was a member , said @entity4 was a ' criminal ' who ' deserved ' his sentence black @entity40 @entity46 , who was a member of both the @entity26 and the @entity24 told the @entity52 in 2011 : ‘ according to the @entity24 , @entity4 was a “ criminal ” and “ deserved ” his prison sentence			0
i was alone in saying the opposite and @entity1 and his cohorts told me i only felt such a thing because i was black			0
he was robustly in support of the apartheid regime in @entity60			0
’ but since the 1980s the speaker has been on a political journey that saw him elected almost entirely by @entity63 in 2010 and has seen him embrace a series of fashionable left - wing causes			1
a senior @entity40 mp told the @entity52 : ‘ @entity1 is pushing hard for @entity10 to be recalled if @entity4 passes away during the summer recess , even though there ’s no precedent for a foreign leader to be honoured in this way			2
‘ many mps think he ’s pushing so hard as an act of penitence for his previous involvement in the @entity24 and allegedly wearing a “ @entity38 ” t - shirt			2
‘ there ’s a mixed view in @entity10			2
some people think @entity4 deserves to be recognised and others feel it would be wrong since we have n’t done it in the past for people like the @entity86 or @entity87			0
recalls cost a lot of money too			2
’ the recall of @entity10 in august 2011 after the riots in @entity93 and other cities cost taxpayers nearly £ 44,000 - but that does n’t include the travel allowances paid to mps in order to get home for the debate			1
a briefing note compiled by the @entity103 shows that not one of the 26 @entity105 recalls since 1948 has concerned the death of a foreign leader			2
most have concerned wars , international crises and terrorist attacks			0
the decision over whether @entity10 is recalled ultimately resides with the speaker , but he is only supposed to act after a request from ministers			1
senior government sources say @entity116 and his ministers would not want to be seen standing in the way of a session to pay tribute to mr @entity4			0
@entity116 and other colleagues are said be surprised by the degree to which mr @entity1 and his staff have pushed the issue in discussions with government whips and officials but officials say they have been surprised by the degree to which mr @entity1 and his staff have pushed the issue in discussions with government whips and officials in @entity131			0
‘ it is clear that @entity1 is determined to recall @entity10			1
he ’s bursting to do it , ’ one source familiar with the discussions said			0
by contrast , mr @entity1 was reported to be irritated by @entity116 ’s determination to recall @entity10 after the death of @entity141 on that occasion , his wife @entity136 , a @entity137 supporter , refused to attend the funeral saying she did not want to join in the ‘ attempted canonisation ’ of the late prime minister			1
a spokesman for the speaker confirmed that discussions about a recall of @entity10 have taken place and that mr @entity1 is supportive of the idea but also claimed that view was shared by ministers			1
asked if the speaker thinks it ’s a good idea , the spokesman said : ‘ yes			2
obviously he thinks it ’s appropriate should the request come in			0
he added : ‘ there have been discussions , obviously			0
there ’s a general consensus			0
i do n’t really think it could be accurately said he is forcing people ’s hands			0
’ @entity166 source said : ‘ no decisions have been taken as the situation has n’t arisen and it easily may not do			0

move to recall @entity10 in the event of his death would cost £ 40,000
opponents say speaker is aiming for ' penitence ' for his 1980s membership of right - wing *conservative* *groups* which disparaged his fight for freedom
