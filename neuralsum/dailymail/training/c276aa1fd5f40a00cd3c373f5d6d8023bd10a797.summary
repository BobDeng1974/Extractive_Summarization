two adult film actors have contracted @entity2 , with one most likely infecting the other during unprotected sex at a film shoot in @entity6 where testing was less stringent than industry standards , officials said			1
one of the actors had previously tested negative for the virus that causes @entity12 before a pair of film shoots , but then began showing symptoms during the second shoot and was later found to be @entity2 - positive , the @entity9 said monday in a statement			1
' in this case , the actor and production company thought he was @entity2 - negative during filming , ' the statement said			1
' shortly after his negative test , @entity2 levels in his body rose rapidly to where he could infect other actors through unprotected sex			1
' one of the actors previously tested negative for the virus that causes @entity12 before a pair of film shoots but then began showing symptoms during the second shoot and was later found to be @entity2 - positive , the @entity9 said ( file photo ) the infections came amid a major decline in porn filming in @entity37 , once the center of porn production in the country , where a 2012 law requires actors to use condoms			1
the number of porn filmmakers applying for filming permits in the county declined from 485 in 2012 to 40 in 2013			0
the @entity48 , a @entity49 - based trade group for the adult film industry , said the pair of film shoots linked to the latest infections occurred in september on a @entity6 set using tests that do not detect @entity2 as early as tests done on sets that fully comply with industry standards			1
' not only did this leave those who participated at risk , it made it much harder to track scene partners once the possible infection was discovered , ' the coalition group said in a statement			0
the group said it joined the @entity9 in declaring a production moratorium when the infections were first discovered			2
it said performers on sets that complied with the more stringent protocols were tested and the moratorium was lifted			0
@entity73 , president of the @entity74 , said infections have happened before during porn productions and will likely happen again			0
' the big lie the industry has been saying all these years , there are no on - set transmissions , has been proven to be untrue , ' he said			0
the states of @entity6 and @entity49 do not require porn actors to be tested for @entity2 , said @entity73 , who has pushed for testing laws in both states and helped pass the condom law in @entity37			1
testing is required under industry rules			0
the @entity48 said regulations such as the condom law drive filmmakers to locations where they do n't undergo as much scrutiny by the industry			0
' non-compliant shoots are one of the chief dangers of pushing the adult industry ' out of @entity49 , the group 's statement said			2
@entity49 health officials would not give further details about the latest cases , citing privacy restrictions			1
a message left with public health officials in @entity6 was not immediately returned			1
the industry has declared several production moratoriums in recent years , but most were for infections believed to have occurred in the private lives of actors rather than during film shoots			2
the last confirmed on - set hiv infection was in 2004			2
after that , the porn industry adopted monthly testing for a range of sexually transmitted diseases			0
last year , the industry increased testing to every 14 days after a woman contracted @entity2			2
