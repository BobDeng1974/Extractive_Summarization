they were the only part of @entity45 territory to be under @entity47 occupation during the war			2
mr @entity0 said : ' he needs to be remembered as he was deeply affected by what happened , but out of respect to those who died in the camps , it would not be right to keep his name on the memorial			1
' @entity0 is an unusual surname on the island and i thought it was strange there was one on the memorial when i saw it and wanted to know more about it			1
' i never met @entity0 so ca n't say a great deal about him			1
i think he kept himself to himself			0
' it is a unique and amazing story and i hope he is remembered in the right way			0

the former shop assistant , who was also known as @entity19 , is still one of 22 names on the @entity21 in @entity22 which was erected in 1996 to remember @entity23 who lost their lives in prisons or camps during the conflict ' as for our relationship the first time i ever saw him was in @entity137 after he was liberated by the @entity138			0
i barely ever saw him again			0
' police came and informed me that he had died			0
i went to his funeral			0
there was no one else to bury him so we did it			0
' it would not be fair if he was on the memorial and i would n't be happy for it as he did n't die under the @entity89			0
but we all remember him fondly even though we were n't close			0
' after being liberated by the @entity138 in october 1944 , @entity0 was sent first @entity38 and then onto @entity37 as @entity9 was still under control of @entity47 troops			1
he never returned to the island			0
@entity0 's life after the war remains a mystery beyond his death			1
the family never knew if he married , had a family of his own or what he did for a living			0
a @entity160 statement said : ' new documents only made available this year and testimony of a surviving relative has proved that @entity0 did not die in captivity as presumed			1
' the memorial was dedicated in 1996 following information brought to light by historian @entity167			0
' no one questioned the information about @entity0 or his inclusion on the memorial , and both were based on material available at the time			2
' until the recent visit the @entity0 family were not aware of the memorial or the mistake on it			2
we are convinced @entity0 and @entity84 are one and the same man			2
' we have verified that beyond any doubt @entity0 did survive			2
his name will be temporarily obscured so it will not be visible for the 2014 @entity185 ceremony in january			0
' once further historical research has established there are no more names to be added or removed from the memorial , the panel engraved with @entity0 's name will be renovated to remove his name permanently			1
