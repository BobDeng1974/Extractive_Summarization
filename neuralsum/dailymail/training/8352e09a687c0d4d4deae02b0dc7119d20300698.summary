a mother has told of her shock after her family - of - five had a chat with president @entity4 during a trip to @entity6 - but that she now wishes she had invited him back for coffee			1
inspired by rumours that the president 's helicopter had landed at the ancient site , @entity12 and her husband @entity13 marched across fields with their three sons in the hope they would catch a glimpse of the @entity19 president			1
at first the family , who live a mile from the monument , were stuck at a fence			2
but a good - natured @entity4 wandered over to where they were standing - and even agreed to pose for a family photo			1
' we kind of edged closer and closer until he noticed us and waved			0
we waved back and then one of the high security men edged us forward and he was moving forward at the same time , which was very exciting			0
' the first person to say something was actually @entity13			1
he said " welcome to @entity60 "			2
' mr @entity4 had ordered his @entity61 to make the unscheduled landing at @entity63 in @entity64 after flying out of @entity65 in south @entity66 following the @entity68 summit			1
mrs @entity12 said : ' at that point , he shook his hand and then he shook all of our hands			2
he said " it is such a beautiful place , do you live around here ? " ' we said we have just moved to the area			2
he said it is very quiet and the air was beautiful and so peaceful			0
' mrs @entity12 - who excitedly tweeted about the meeting while still at @entity6 - is running the @entity82 tomorrow			1
it is one of ten major races she is doing , while dressed as a bumble bee , to raise money for @entity88			0
several people took to her @entity91 page to make a donation to the cause after seeing her tweets about meeting the president			0
her total now stands at almost £ 2,400			0
she said : ' we should have invited him back for coffee			0
i should have asked him to sponsor me for one of my races ! ’ not a normal walk in the country : the president greets 35 - year - old @entity12 and @entity27 and their three sons			1
they headed from their home a mile away towards the monument after hearing rumours he was there @entity114 to meet you ! the president shook hands with the family after the unexpected landing by his helicopter a moment they 'll never forget : the family were stuck at a fence - but a good - natured @entity4 wandered over to say hello			1
mrs @entity12 told @entity123 : ' i squealed like a teenager ! you 'd think i would know better ' remember to take a photo : the family captured the moment - but one of mrs @entity12 's sons was n't bothered ' he was very sweet actually - one of the boys had put his hand on barbed wire and he was saying " be careful "			1
' the president 's motorcade weaved its way for 20 minutes across @entity137 , to the amazement of passing drivers			0
under grey skies , the president then embarked on tour of the prehistoric stone circle and henge with @entity145 , the curator of the site for @entity147			2
‘ how cool is this ? spectacular ! ’ the president exclaimed as he was afforded privileged access to the ancient sarsen stones themselves			1
mr @entity4 later said he had wanted to ‘ knock @entity6 off my bucket list ’			1
not everyone was so delighted , however			0
motorist @entity155 tweeted : ' so @entity4 wrecked my @entity157 journey today , then i see him up close to @entity6			1
one word pretty much describes my feelings			0
' @entity161 added : ' i wonder if @entity4 got stuck in his own traffic jam			2
certainly made my @entity157 journey past @entity6 more memorable			1
' ‘ how cool is this ? spectacular ! ’ the president exclaimed as he was afforded privileged access to the ancient sarsen stones themselves			1
he was later heard to say he had wanted to ' knock @entity6 off my bucket list ' time for a photo : the 4,000 - year - old stones on @entity137 are rarely accessible to the public feeling presidential : the remaining sandstone blocks have stood upright for thousands of years the first monument at the site on @entity137 was probably built around 5,000 years ago , to mark where prehistoric people buried their cremated dead			1
it was only later that the enormous sandstone sarsens and smaller bluestones were set up in the centre , transported up to 150 miles			0
historians believe the stone circle may have been a temple , a burial ground , an astronomical calendar or all three			0
although it appears isolated , it is actually just one part of a vast system of ancient earthworks on what would have been an unusually open landscape when @entity195 was an island of forests			0
despite its significance , it continued deteriorating badly until the turn of the last century , when passionate campaigns began to save it after it was gifted to the nation in 1918			0
source : @entity147 @entity145 , @entity147 ’s @entity6 curator , said : ‘ mr @entity4 was fascinated by the story of the stones , what we know about them and the mysteries that have yet to be solved			1
he asked lots of questions about how old the monument is , how long it took to build it , and what was its purpose			0
‘ he described the atmosphere around the stones as " really special " and his visit to @entity6 as “ a highlight of my tour ”			1
' he particularly loved seeing the colour and texture of the stones			0
it was a beautiful still evening and it was a privilege to show the @entity19 president around this unique monument which continues to inspire and intrigue people			2
’ @entity6 general manager @entity231 added : ‘ every day people from all over the world make the trip to the ancient stones but this visit was a particularly special one			1
’ historians still disagree over the function of @entity6 , which was far more extensive when it was assembled thousands of years ago on @entity239			2
built between 3,000 and 1,600 @entity242 , the stone circle may have been a temple , a burial ground , an astronomical calendar or all three , scholars say			0
no one knows for sure either how ancient @entity195 got the stones , which weigh up to 45 tonnes , to the site or what they used them for			1
curious : the president asked several questions about the origin of the henge and its original function @entity145 , @entity147 ’s @entity6 curator , said : ' it was a beautiful still evening and it was a privilege to show the @entity19 president around this unique monument which continues to inspire and intrigue ' end of a long day : jokes circulated that the president had met ' a bunch of immovable objects with no clear purpose ' ... and then visited @entity6			1
the @entity68 summit was held amid escalating threats by @entity267 long derided as a national disgrace , the visitor facilities at the monument have recent undergone a major refurbishment			0
photo opportunity : the moment was also captured on countless journalists ' mobile phones ( pictured ) the a-road that ran right along the edge of the site was closed and grassed over last year in a bid to ' restore the dignity ' of the @entity282			2
the president was afforded a rare honour in being able to walk right up to the stones			2
that privilege has long since been rescinded for ordinary visitors - except on the summer solstice , when they are allowed to revel in the site 's pagan origins with dances and music at dawn			0
this week 's @entity295 in @entity65 was held amid an escalating crisis in @entity297 and @entity298 , with @entity267 members threatening to behead a @entity195 hostage after murdering two @entity19 journalists			2
the @entity19 and 10 of its key allies agreed the group is a significant threat to @entity68 countries and that they will take on the militants by squeezing their financial resources and going after them with military might			0
' outgunned and outmanned ' @entity298 forces will be bolstered by foreign powers arranged through what is currently a loose coalition including @entity195			0
but critics worry that there are doubts over how the terrorists can be tackled without another major @entity318 intervention in @entity297			0
and the @entity319 is also concerned over the hundreds of young @entity195 who have flown to @entity297 and @entity298 to join jihadi groups in the escalating conflict			0
perhaps it was inevitable that some joked the president had spent time with a clutch of immovable objects with no clear direction ... and then visited @entity6			1
there was a mixture of reactions on @entity332 to the news that @entity4 was visiting @entity6			1

@entity12 , 35 , marched up to site with husband @entity13 and three sons
they had heard president @entity4 had made *surprise* stop at ancient site
mr @entity4 spoke to the excited family and posed for a photo on her phone
she said : ' @entity13 said : " welcome to @entity60 " and he said it was beautiful '
@entity4 exclaimed ' how cool is this ? spectacular ! ' as walked among stones
president later said he had wanted to ' knock @entity6 off my bucket list '
@entity353 made *diversion* after summit in @entity65 , south @entity66
