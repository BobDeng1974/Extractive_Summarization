@entity1 's capitulations against the @entity3 's best teams prompted @entity4 to question the character of his team - mates , but he believes @entity7 will help them kick the habit			1
@entity10 , who visit @entity12 on sunday , fired nine past @entity1 goalkeeper @entity4 in two games last season while champions @entity15 scored 11			1
those four hammerings – and a 4 - 0 defeat at @entity19 – helped get both @entity20 and @entity21 sacked , wrecked top four dreams and damaged the rebuilding process as the club tried to replace @entity25 with seven new players			1
' when you lost once it can happen but when you lost against top teams twice , three times , four times it means there was something wrong in our side			2
' when you 're a player you 're just thinking about the next game and you do n't know what will happen			2
the more you win the better you feel			2
if you get a bad result you need to respond quickly next game with a victory			0
' i have played a lot of important games and i have the faculty to switch from game to game but , collectively it is never easy to bounce back			0
this is why it 's important always to believe in yourself , your teammates , your team , your club and the manager 's philosophy to always try to keep in a good level			1
this is why we are working to find the best solution but always to improve as a team			0
' @entity4 reached the point when he felt the urge to speak out			1
' we have to show more character , ' he said , in april			0
' we sometimes had the feeling that we gave up			0
' must do better : @entity1 conceded nine goals in two games against @entity10 during last season blue murder : @entity74 ( @entity75 ) scores one of the 11 goals @entity15 put past @entity1 last season with @entity80 interested , the @entity79 goalkeeper seemed ready to force a move but spoke to @entity82 before the @entity83 and was convinced instead to sign a new five - year contract at @entity1 and has been impressed with the early signs of life under @entity7			1
he believes the @entity87 is toughening @entity1 up and demanding a greater commitment to his philosophy			1
' it was not just a lack of character , ' said @entity4			1
' we are in the best league in the world and we have to play at a high level			0
for that we need to see all players involved , ready to play for the team and to think only about the team			0
' we changed a lot of things			0
we have a new manager , with his own staff			2
we believe in his concept and his philosophy , and we are working every day to go in his way and to play as a team			0
we want to show everyone we have the potential to be a good team in the league			0
' playing from the back : @entity4 will be asked to perform a keeper - sweeper role under @entity7 full makeover : @entity7 oversees training as he continues to implement to his philosophy for @entity4 personally , the @entity7 way means more touches as a sweeper - keeper and fewer long balls launched from the back but he added : ' the most important thing is that everyone in the changing room believes in this philosophy			1
' we need to keep working , keep the same spirit as we showed in the last few games and to have confidence in the changing room			0
you need to win , win , win			0
this is what we expect for this season			2
' many of those signed last summer are more settled , which has helped @entity7 and , by a strange quirk , it is @entity10 who are working to help an array of summer signings gel after cashing in on @entity143			1
numbers game : @entity10 have tried to replace @entity143 ( @entity75 ) in a similar way that @entity1 filled the void left by @entity25 ( r ) with a glut of new signings ' when you have a lot of new players in the squad it is never easy for them to adapt , ' said @entity4			1
@entity155 is maybe a bit different to other countries , with the characteristics of the @entity3 and the intensity , the level of your opponents and it 's always a tough game , so they need you to be fit , always			1
