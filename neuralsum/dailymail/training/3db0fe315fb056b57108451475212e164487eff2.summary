an @entity1 rap parody of @entity3 's hit song fancy has been uploaded to @entity4 , but do n’t expect the tourist board to be using it to promote the country			1
called i 'm so @entity8 ! the rapper known only as @entity10 packs plenty of references into the song from @entity14 to ciggies to @entity16 from @entity17			1
starting with the line ' first things first i 'm fair dinkum ' , pretty much gives you a good idea of what else is to come over the next two minutes			0
it now goes : ' i 'm so @entity8 , you already know			0
i 'm in the only lane from @entity37 to @entity38			0
remember my name ... it 's @entity10 ! ' @entity10 goes on to rap about how he likes to ' chuck a sickie ' , spends his time ' doing bugger all ' and describes himself as a ' lower class bogan '			2
his chances of the song being used in a national tourism advertisement will probably have gone at this stage			0
the city of @entity37 gets a mention in @entity10 's song and video @entity10 packs plenty of references into the song from ciggies to cricketer @entity60 however , @entity10 's only getting started as he gives a shout out to @entity62 , scallops , fish n ' chips , and meat pies , telling everyone ' you should taste that ' , while also claiming to have a ' moustache on my face like @entity60 '			1
his @entity4 video definitely is a light - hearted look at @entity8 and follows coach @entity75 's song and video package on @entity4 earlier this month called ‘ @entity8 ! ’ which is a cover of @entity77 ’s number one 2003 hit ‘ @entity80 ! ’ with appropriate @entity8 images and lyrics			2
both videos were aimed at @entity1 celebrations and only time will tell which one proves to be the most popular in the long run			0
@entity10 's version may just get him in more trouble			2
@entity62 , scallops , fish n ' chips , and meat pies all get a run out too in @entity10 's rap although a good laugh , @entity3 may not be laughing after she hears what 's been done to her song			1

rapper @entity10 's rap parody tries to pack in all that 's good about @entity8
meat pies , @entity62 , scallops , and fish n ' chips even get a mention
the rap pokes *fun* at being @entity8 on the country 's national day
but international star azalea may not be laughing after she hears what 's been done to her song
