the stumps and the bails and their zing lights glowed bright red in the @entity4 night as @entity6 ’s throw smashed into the wickets , ran out @entity8 and ended a wretched mismatch between @entity10 and @entity11			1
@entity12 for the shade of @entity11 ’s embarrassment , red for the humiliation that stung the cheeks of their players as they fell to a crushing 111 run defeat to the co-hosts , red for @entity21 and the massacre that unfolded at the @entity4 on the first day of the @entity23			1
@entity11 captain @entity24 had put @entity10 into bat and then watched as they ran up a massive total of 342 - 9			1
@entity8 ( right ) is run out to complete @entity11 's humiliation in their @entity23 opener on saturday nobody has ever scored that many runs against @entity11 in a @entity23 before			1
even the @entity36 , in all the beatings they have handed out to us in one - day internationals , have never amassed a total that big			1
we might not have been expecting an awful lot from @entity11 against the tournament favourites but , let ’s be honest , we were expecting more than this			1
this was a no - contest			2
it was circus entertainment for the @entity36 who crammed into this magnificent arena and got to guffaw at the ineptitude of the @entity50			0
there were times , sadly , when @entity11 were comically bad			1
@entity53 put down an easy catch offered up by @entity55 from the fifth ball of @entity10 ’s innings			1
@entity58 went on to make 135			0
@entity59 missed a chance to catch @entity61			0
@entity63 claimed a hat - trick with the last three balls of the @entity10 innings but it was probably the most futile hat - trick in cricket history			1
@entity10 ’s batsmen had taken the game away from @entity11 by then			1
@entity11 ’s ‘ death bowling ’ was poor again			1
they conceded 105 runs off the last 10 overs			0
and too many of their batsmen gave their wickets away too easily and too cheaply			0
that included @entity79 , out for another duck			2
by the end , the 84,000 fans at the @entity4 almost seemed to feel sorry for @entity11			1
there was even applause for the gutsy @entity85 as he launched a one - man assault on the @entity36 total , a lone brave fighting overwhelming odds			2
paceman @entity63 was one of the @entity11 bowlers who felt the full force of the @entity36 onslaught @entity36 opener @entity55 was dropped on nought and went on to make 135 the umpires seemed to want to put @entity11 out of their misery , too			1
they ended the match by giving both @entity85 and @entity8 out off the same delivery , @entity85 lbw and @entity8 run out			1
it turned out both decisions were wrong			0
@entity85 , who was on 98 , called for a review of the lbw decision and was reprieved			0
replays then showed @entity6 ’s throw had beaten @entity8 but it was later agreed that the ball should have been dead as soon as the umpire raised his finger to dismiss @entity85			0
it was n’t as if the match was close			2
it was n’t as if the mistake affected the result , although it probably cost @entity85 the century he deserved			0
but the game was already over			0
@entity11 were only trying to prolong a slow death			1
@entity11 never recovered from @entity53 failing to take an easy catch in the first over yes , the @entity36 played brilliantly			1
@entity58 produced a masterclass in power hitting , racing to a magnificent century on his @entity23 debut			1
@entity120 produced one of the best catches this ground has ever witnessed to claim the wicket of @entity62			0
the three @entity125 — @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 — bowled with hostility and precision			2
but @entity11 made the victory an awful lot easier than it should have been			1
they made it feel like a capitulation , not just a defeat			2
‘ here goes , ’ former @entity11 skipper , @entity137 , wrote on @entity138 as @entity11 ’s wickets started to fall			2
he posted a link to a picture			0
it was a white flag being run up a pole			2
this may only have been @entity11 ’s first match of this @entity23 but even though they are still almost certain to qualify for the quarter - finals , it still felt like a desperately bleak performance			1
@entity58 ( left ) produced a masterclass in power hitting , racing to a magnificent century it feels as though so much has been squandered in the past five years since @entity151 and @entity152 led @entity11 to that emphatic @entity154 triumph in @entity10			1
so much has been lost			0
so much has been frittered away in the petty infighting over @entity156 which has drained the team of energy and talent and lingered as a reminder of the way we were			0
once , @entity11 seemed upwardly mobile and ready to step into the gap the great @entity36 side of @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 had left behind			2
those hopes are distant memories now			0
@entity11 , particularly on the one - day stage , are a team who have fallen far , far behind			1
they were outplayed by the @entity36 in every department			0
they are a team shot through with confusion , indecision and uncertainty			0
all those faults were on view here yesterday			0
@entity127 ( right ) celebrates as @entity24 is dismissed for a six - ball duck , his fourth in five innings @entity11 captain @entity24 looks dejected as he walks past @entity10 while they celebrate it was a brutal illustration of just how wide is the chasm between these two cricketing nations at the moment			1
@entity11 are not closing the gap on their old enemy			2
the gap is getting wider			0
there is no point pretending that @entity152 had made a strong case for retaining the limited overs captaincy before he was sacked last december but his removal appears to have made things even worse			0
there is an authority vacuum			0
there is a lack of coherence in decision - making			0
so , for the first match of the tournament , when most teams are seeking to build on an established formula , @entity11 made changes			1
@entity205 was dropped , @entity204 was brought in at @entity206 , @entity85 was moved down the order to six			0
@entity36 bowler @entity127 is congratulated by his team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity24 @entity210 , not @entity211 , opened the bowling with @entity8			1
they are not the most controversial decisions in themselves but they do not suggest an awful lot of joined - up thinking			0
‘ @entity11 really do make things difficult for themselves , ’ @entity137 wrote later			2
‘ change of batting line - up and team really does send a wrong message			0
’ quite how @entity11 regroup from here remains to be seen			2
they face an in - form @entity227 side in @entity229 on friday before travelling to @entity230 and the potential banana skin of a match against @entity233			1
@entity11 ’s heaviest @entity23 defeat came against @entity235 in 1999 when they lost by 122 runs			1
at least they dodged that record			0
in the search for positives from the humiliation at the @entity4 , that is about as good as it gets			2
@entity128 runs past the crowd with his finger up high after catching @entity11 's @entity245 @entity85 did not know whether to blame bungling team - mates or bumbling umpires for being denied a maiden one - day international hundred at the @entity4			1
the batsman was stranded on 98 not out after running out of partners , though umpires @entity252 and @entity254 must shoulder the blame for a farcical end to the match			0
@entity85 was given out lbw but , even though his review was successful , the umpires decreed that @entity8 was dismissed via a run out in the same passage of play — when , in fact , a dead ball should have been called			2
@entity8 and team - mate @entity85 talk to the umpires at the end of their defeat @entity53 was holding his head in shame after spilling @entity36 opener @entity55 on 0 in the first over			2
@entity58 made @entity53 and @entity11 pay with a devastating 135 off 128 deliveries to take the game beyond @entity24 ’s men			1
@entity63 added his name to the @entity23 roll of honour after bagging a hat - trick — but they wo n’t go down as the best three wickets he has ever taken			1
@entity279 was first to go , holing out to deep third man , where @entity210 took a terrific catch			0
@entity284 ’s catch to snare @entity6 was even better and @entity126 completed the hat - trick , picking out @entity8 at mid-off as a sheepish - looking @entity63 celebrated only the eighth hat - trick in the history of the competition			0
@entity63 celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity126 to complete his hat trick			0

@entity11 fell to a crushing 111 - run defeat at @entity4
@entity10 ran up 342 - 9 , their highest ever one - day score against @entity11
@entity11 bowled out for *231* and captain @entity24 dismissed for a duck
@entity11 face @entity227 in their second @entity23 match on friday
