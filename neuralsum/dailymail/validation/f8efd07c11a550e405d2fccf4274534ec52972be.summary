i understand the angst that many @entity3 supporters feel over the future of the club under @entity6			1
i understand why a swathe of the club ’s support has started to give up hope that @entity6 can recreate the success he brought to the club more than a decade ago			1
i even started to inch in that direction myself last autumn after @entity3 made a poor start to this season			1
sometimes , it feels like @entity6 is the problem , not the solution			1
he is a stubborn man and it can be hard to defend the choices he makes			0
@entity6 is facing increasing calls for his resignation from @entity3 fans after an undulating season @entity6 look despondently as @entity25 tear @entity3 side apart in the last 16 first - leg @entity28 tie after the desperately dispiriting defeat by @entity25 , @entity6 will come under fierce scrutiny again when @entity3 visit @entity32 to contest an @entity34 quarter - final			1
lose and people will say that their season is over			1
lose and the ‘ @entity38 ’ bandwagon , which is already accelerating , will move up another gear			1
well , maybe they should be thinking about slamming the brakes on it instead			1
because in the last five months , @entity3 have taken great strides forward			1
i do n’t buy the idea that the club is standing still or even going backwards			2
the defeat by @entity25 notwithstanding , there are real signs of progress at last			0
put it this way , if you are an @entity3 fan , which team in the @entity56 would you swap places with today ? look around			1
which team looks more upwardly mobile or better set for the future than @entity6 ’s side ? @entity63 ? i do n’t think so			1
they ’re starting to look like a side at the end of an old cycle , not at the start of a new one			0
@entity32 may have spent lavishly under @entity72 but they are beset by doubts about @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			1
and that ’s before we start on their defence and the continuing absence of a dominating central midfield player			0
despite all their lavish investment , @entity63 do not look like defending their @entity56 crown @entity75 has been a disappointment since joining @entity32 for £ 60m from @entity86 spurs ? well , @entity88 might well be advancing under @entity89 but they ’re still a way away from the level they achieved under @entity93			1
@entity94 ? @entity94 are looking good again under @entity95 and , like @entity3 , their prospects are improving			2
ok , so that leaves @entity98			0
and everybody would swap with @entity98 at the moment , but the point is that @entity3 ’s future looks bright again			1
it is easy , and valid , to point out the occasional failings of @entity105 , but why not consider @entity3 ’s array of attacking talent instead ? @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and , yes , @entity114 are formidable forward - thinking players close to their prime			1
and that ’s before we talk about @entity119 and @entity120 , coming back from injury , and the emergence of @entity123 as a holding midfielder			0
@entity125 has not made the strides expected of him since his summer move from @entity128 but his qualities are not in doubt			2
@entity105 winces during the defeat by @entity25 , but @entity3 will surely strengthen their defence @entity108 is surrounded by an embarrassment of attacking riches in the @entity3 ranks there is no reason why he should not bolster @entity3 ’s defence next season			1
if @entity6 signs another central defender in the summer and perhaps a more experienced central midfielder , there is no reason why they should not challenge for the title next season			1
it would be a shame if @entity3 lost their nerve on @entity6 now just when it feels as if they are on the verge of being real contenders again			1
their victory over @entity63 at the @entity154 in january was the clearest evidence yet of the fact they are casting off the inferiority complex they had developed against the other leading clubs			0
the tie against @entity32 , at the venue where they were humiliated 8 - 2 in 2011 , will be another good test			2
@entity3 are the @entity34 holders , let ’s not forget			1
there is plenty to suggest that they are about to re-emerge into the light			0
defeat by @entity32 wo n’t change that even if it will , inevitably , lead to renewed calls for @entity6 ’s head			1
it has got to the stage now where some @entity3 fans behave as if @entity6 is the only thing standing between them and the @entity56 summit			1
there seems to be an assumption that , once liberated from the yoke of the professorial tyrant , @entity3 would be free to soar			2
free to soar back to the top of the @entity56 table as if that were their rightful place , as if that were the position that their history demanded			0
@entity6 celebrates breaking his trophy drought last may ... and more could follow if @entity3 hold their nerve @entity6 last won the @entity56 title in 2004 , and his side may well challenge for the title next season there is another inconvenient truth here : even in the last 10 years under @entity6 that fans like to characterise as a desert of achievement , @entity3 have played at a higher level than they had in the 30 years before he arrived			1
it may come as a surprise to some of those @entity3 fans who think that football began in 1992 but in the period from 1966 to @entity6 ’s arrival in 1996 , @entity3 ’s average position in the league was between sixth and seventh			1
their traditional place in @entity214 football @entity212 was not in the top four			0
there is no worth in lionising @entity6 just because of his longevity			2
nor is he entitled to remain in situ because he is the father of the modern @entity3 and his achievements built the @entity220			2
but he worked stoically through the period of retrenchment that followed the building of the new stadium and kept @entity3 among the elite			2
it is only now that @entity6 has been given the tools to aim for the top again			2
he has got @entity3 moving forward			1
he deserves the chance to try to finish the job			0
stadiums no longer a haven for bigotry the defenders of the faith bemoan the fact that you ca n’t do anything at a football ground these days without attracting sanction			0
ca n’t throw bananas on to the pitch and make monkey chants like we used to because it will upset black supporters			0
ca n’t sing songs about @entity248 and @entity249 or make hissing sounds to mimic gas chambers like we used to because it will upset @entity254 supporters			0
ca n’t sing songs using a derogatory term for people who have @entity258 because it might upset supporters who have kids with disabilities			0
ca n’t even yell abuse at women in the directors ’ box or sitting on the bench and sing songs urging them to get their kit off because it might upset female supporters			0
‘ it ’s getting ridiculous , ’ the legions of the disaffected say			2
‘ what has happened to the football we used to know ? ’ well , the answer is simple			2
what has happened is that our society has decided stadiums should no longer be havens for those who wish to vent their bigotry and their ignorance without fear of disapproval or repercussions			0
what has happened is that we have come to the conclusion that it is wrong for swathes of our population to be made to feel uncomfortable when they go to watch their team play			0
people can lament that if they wish to			0
the shame is that it has taken us this long to come to our senses			0
at least spitting does n’t threaten careers i have always found it hard to understand why biting a player on the shoulder during a football match and not even breaking the skin attracts far more opprobrium than snapping the same player ’s leg with a terrible tackle , sending him to hospital and putting his entire career in doubt			0
up to a point , it is the same with spitting			0
‘ if a player spat at me , ’ @entity318 striker @entity317 said on thursday , ‘ he ’d be eating his supper through a straw			2
’ i wonder if @entity317 has considered that if an opponent committed the altogether more acceptable offence of deliberately smashing his jaw with a swinging elbow , it would be @entity328 who would be eating through a straw			0
@entity330 appears to launch spit in the direction of the @entity333 striker , who then retaliates @entity32 defender @entity330 has received a six - match ban from the @entity34 after the ugly incident ‘ there is nothing worse in football than spitting , ’ player after player has said after the altercation between @entity330 and @entity339 at @entity340 on wednesday			1
i ’m sorry but i do n’t agree			0
there is nothing worse in football than depriving another man of his livelihood			0
pathetic and unpleasant though it may be , spitting never threatens that .			0

many @entity3 fans fear for the future of the club under @entity6
@entity6 will come under fierce scrutiny once more when @entity3 face @entity32 in the @entity34 on monday
lose and people will say that their season is over . lose and the ‘ @entity38 ’ bandwagon will move up another gear
maybe they should be thinking about slamming the brakes on it instead
because in the last five months , @entity3 have taken great strides forward ...
