by @entity1 reporter it might be the happiest place on earth , but your wallet wo n't be feeling any happier after splashing out even more to ' experience the magic ' of @entity8			2
the cost of going to the @entity10 at @entity11 just got more expensive			0
although @entity8 wo n't specify the reasons behind the increase , the @entity13 parks are home to the company 's new high - tech wristband - based ticketing and ride reservation system , called @entity21 + which cost the company $ 1.5 billion			1
better start saving : the price of a one - day ticket to @entity11 's @entity10 is now $ 99			1
that 's a $ 4 increase from the previous price hike announced in june 2013			0
the price hike went into effect sunday @entity30 costs : @entity21 + , includes wristbands , dubbed @entity32 , which are outfitted with radio - frequency identification chips that interact with scanners throughout the park known as @entity32 , they function as all - in - one theme - park tickets , hotel - room keys and credit cards			0
the bracelets allow reservations to be made for individual rides to be made from home for as many as three attractions a day in a single theme park — or four in the @entity10			1
@entity21 + , which @entity8 began developing more than five years ago cost close to $ 1.5 billion according to the @entity45 and is likely to be a major factor behind this weeks price increase			1
@entity8 expects to recoup the large investment by encouraging guests to spend more on things like souvenirs and foods and by getting them to spend longer in the parks			2
is it worth it ? @entity8 faces growing questions from @entity57 about when the company will see financial returns from the sweeping technology project , which @entity8 hopes will ultimately get visitors planning more of their vacations in advance and spending more time and money on its property how it works : @entity21 + is designed to allow visitors to book ride times weeks before their vacations , and the @entity32 act as all - in - one park tickets , room keys and credit cards by collecting more personal data about visitors , from their favorite characters to their spending habits , @entity8 hopes to develop more effective sales offers customized for individual families			1
not only did the annual increase on admission take place earlier than expected , but the news was quietly released less than 24 hours before the changes took effect			0
previously , @entity8 has announced such information on its official blog			0
the price increase also comes shortly before @entity10 will complete its @entity89 expansion by opening of the @entity91 ; that opening will occur in time for early summer crowds			0
@entity11 has raised the one - day ticket price to the @entity10 by $ 4 so that it now costs $ 99 before taxes for visitors over age 9			1
costly : some analysts estimate that @entity8 has spent more than $ 1 billion on @entity21 + , which @entity8 once hoped to have fully launched last year single - day tickets for the resort 's other parks — @entity102 , @entity8 's @entity103 and @entity104 — also went up by $ 4			1
it now costs $ 94 to get into those parks for visitors over age 9			2
for children under age 10 , the cost is $ 93 to get into the @entity10 and $ 88 to enter the other parks			1
@entity8 spokeswoman @entity112 says the pricing reflects the high quality of the parks			2
she also says that most guests buy multi-day tickets , which are considerably cheaper per day this is the second price hike in less than a year			2
' it 's all about supply and demand , ' writes @entity122 , editor - in - chief of @entity123 , an unofficial @entity8 planning and fan site			0
' @entity126 is going up , not down ; so as long as people keep paying the prices , @entity8 ( any business ) will keep raising them			0
' @entity10 : while last year 's price hikes hit visitors to @entity11 as well as @entity133 and @entity8 's @entity134 in @entity135 , the latest increase appears confined to @entity13 the prices are hard to swallow especially may be a bit hard to swallow , since @entity8 posted record profits during its previous fiscal quarter			1
it ’s also hard for families , since they also have to pay for high - priced food and expensive souvenirs			0
@entity145 also raised its prices last summer where a one - day , one - park ticket is $ 92 .			0

@entity8 's @entity10 prices are going up
it 's more *economical* to purchase multi-day passes instead of the single day tickets
visitors will also see increases at @entity102 and other parks
prices have increased in order to fund the *introduction* of wireless bracelets
@entity164 made $ *1.4* billion in profit in the last three months
