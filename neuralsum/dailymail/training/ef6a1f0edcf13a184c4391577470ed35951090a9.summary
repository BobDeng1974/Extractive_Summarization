by @entity1 reporter published : 06:55 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 10:47 est , 15 september 2013 the majority of most people 's @entity4 followers are merely cyber strangers , known only through the digital text of 140 characters			2
but one user of the social networking site decided he wanted to get to know his online chums a little more - and set himself the challenge of tracking down and meeting them face - to - face			2
@entity15 magician and writer @entity14 , 32 , was whiling away a boring saturday afternoon when he came up with his fun idea			1
mission : @entity14 set out to meet his cyber friends on @entity4 - and has taken snaps with 150 of them @entity22 thought : @entity14 , 32 , came up with the idea in january but did n't think much of it conjurer : the @entity15 magician had 170 followers at the time and set about filtering out spam followers true friends : he worked out he had 150 ' real ' followers and started meeting them in his home city snowball : before long he found himself booking train tickets all over the country to meet far - flung followers snap happy : soon @entity14 found himself travelling further and further south beaming : after passing through the @entity38 he made his way to the south coast racking up the miles : he was determined to continue the quirky quest and headed to the @entity43 shining light : one of the highlights of his mammoth journey was meeting followers in his native wales but what started as an idle thought turned into a full - blown mission - and he has so far met up with and been photographed with nearly 150 of his followers , travelling the length and breadth of the country in the process			1
the story of his quirky quest has gone viral and he has been featured on tv and in papers around the world			2
@entity14 told @entity63 : ' it has been absolutely mental - i knew there would be some interest but not to this level			1
it literally started out as a bit of fun - there was no intelectual rigour involved in the process at all			0
' pleasant surprise : @entity14 said every single one of the followers was ' incredibly nice ' who are you again ? @entity14 admitted many of the followers had no idea why they were following him performer : but some discovered @entity14 after his gigs at the @entity85 first meeting : most people looked utterly thrilled to put a face to the name when they met @entity14 heading north again : after finishing in @entity89 , @entity14 started the long rail trip back to @entity91 connection : ' the beauty of @entity4 is that you can really shape your account and follow like - minded people , ' said @entity14 risk : but he says his mission highlighted just how much information people are willing to share online high spirits : @entity14 met a lot of people in their homes but also had a few nights in the pub that bit of fun started in january when he had 270 followers			1
after filtering out some of the ' spam ' followers , he realised there were 150 people to meet , and set about the task , first starting in @entity115 and @entity116 before booking a raft of train tickets and trundling around the country			1
over two weeks , he visited 17 cities , including @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , while he contacted his overseas followers over @entity129			2
' everyone i met was incredibly nice , there were no nutters , ' he said			0
' but i think that 's the beauty of @entity4 , you have a lot of control over who you connect with and most were like - minded , although quite a few had no idea why they were connected with me			0
' memorable nights : @entity14 met a number of characters on the trip , including this @entity146 lookalike , right taken aback : little did @entity14 imagine the stir his mission would cause and his story hit the world stage this week ' mental ' : after the story broke in @entity91 , his followers doubled to more than 300 off the scale : after the tale was picked up by national television he passed 12,000 followers foul play : @entity14 suspects the majority of his new followers sprung up due to a hacker career changer : such has been the interest , @entity14 is thinking of writing a stage sketch about his experience no stopping him : and he says he will continue trying to meet as many of his new followers as possible foreign trip : @entity14 says he may even have to start flying abroad to meet some of his followers after the media picked up on his odyssey last week , his followers doubled before exploding to more than 12,000 , although he suspects he may have been hacked			1
despite this , the interest has been such that he has decided to make a show about his experience			0
' i really had planned to stop at 150 and that would be that , ' he said			0
' but i think i will now carry it on , meeting a few more for my blog every month			0
i think it will make for a pretty good sketch			0
