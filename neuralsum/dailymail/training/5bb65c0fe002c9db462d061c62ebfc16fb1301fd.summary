as the 28 - year - old prince was en route to @entity11 , prince @entity8 was visiting his son ’s airbase at @entity14 in @entity15 to honour @entity1 ’s unit , @entity16			1
the prince , who undertook a four - month frontline stint as an @entity20 attack helicopter pilot in september last year , will collect his when he returns from his tour			1
while prince @entity1 was en route to @entity11 , prince @entity8 was visiting his son 's airbase at @entity14 in @entity15 today to honour @entity1 's unit , @entity16 @entity8 , who was handing out medals in his role as colonel - in - chief of the @entity20 , joked : ' it 's a particular pleasure to see so many of @entity16 , which my youngest son serves in , on parade even though he is not here - he shoved off , probably because he knew his ancient parents were coming ' @entity8 spoke to the service men and women as he presented operational service medals to the squadron along with reservists , who have returned from @entity4 @entity8 , who was handing out medals in his role as colonel - in - chief of the @entity20 , joked self - deprecatingly : ‘ it ’s a particular pleasure to see so many of @entity16 , which my youngest son serves in , on parade even though he is not here – he shoved off , probably because he knew his ancient parents were coming			1
’ the prince added : ‘ having heard from him about your remarkable exploits in @entity4 , i have some better understanding of just what you ’re all up to , the challenges you face and constant demands you are under			2
‘ if it is any consolation , i understand very well just how many demands are faced by service families when you find yourselves required to go here , there and everywhere at short notice			2
‘ i think we owe the families here an enormous debt of gratitude			0
’ his son ’s tour of the @entity6 , which begins in @entity11 this afternoon before moving onto @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 before culminating in a charity polo match in @entity67 , @entity68 , is attracting enormous interest stateside – not least because his last trip , back in august , attracted a great many headlines of a different kind			1
prince @entity1 's tour of the @entity6 begins in @entity11 this afternoon before moving on to @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 before culminating in a charity polo match in @entity67 , @entity68			1
he is pictured above playing a game on a visit to a technology institute in @entity78 last month prince @entity8 told the troops : ' i think we owe the families here an enormous debt of gratitude ' on a pre-deployment ‘ lads ’ holiday ’ to @entity86 , the third in line to the throne was photographed playing a game of ’ strip billiards ’ with a group of women in his £ 5,000 - a - night hotel suite			1
@entity1 has always refused to publicly apologise for his antics , which caused huge embarrassment to the @entity97 , but admits he ‘ let his family down ’			1
today he will be hoping to put the incident behind him as he focuses on some of the other great passions in his life – his charitable initiatives			0
his trip begins on the world - famous @entity104 this afternoon where he will view an exhibition staged by the @entity107 , an anti-landmine charity once championed by his late mother , @entity108 , @entity108			1
@entity108 sparked an international outcry 16 years ago when she walked through a live minefield in @entity111 to highlight the shocking legacy of anti-personnel landmines in january 1997 , just months before her tragic death			0
but her subsequent calls for a worldwide ban on landmines sparked a global row over the impartiality of the @entity97			0
the senior royal presented major @entity121 with a trophy as the @entity124 government ministers reacted with fury , with the then junior defence minister , @entity127 , describing the princess as ‘ ill informed ’ and a ‘ loose cannon ’			2
the shocked royal rejected their criticism , insisting she was not a political figure but simply wanted to highlight the scale of the humanitarian disaster			2
‘ i ’m only trying to help , ’ she said as she cuddled landmine victim @entity135			0
the image went round the world , forever linked to the princess and a powerful symbol of the horrors of war			0
@entity1 has long been keen to take up his mother ’s mantle and in 2010 visited @entity144 to learn more about @entity107 ’s work			1
during that trip , he meet dozens of people who had lost limbs to landmines and was given the chance to detonate several mines himself , wearing the same protective visor and body armour as his mother			0
according to aides , he has been looking for a way to support the charity – which is based in @entity159 and has cleared more than 1.4 million landmines since 1988 - more formally ever since			2
earlier this year , he became patron of their 25th anniversary appeal			0
during his speech , @entity8 said : ' if it is any consolation , i understand very well just how many demands are faced by service families when you find yourselves required to go here , there and everywhere at short notice ' this evening , the prince will be the guest of honour at a glitzy reception in the gardens of the @entity179 ambassador ’s residence , where he will be introduced to the cream of @entity179 society in @entity11 as well as charity representatives			1
the ambassador , sir @entity183 , will be a familiar face as he served as prince @entity8 ’s deputy private secretary between 1990 and 1993			2
@entity1 will take time to address the 170 guests , his first speech of the tour , before attending a dinner also thrown by the ambassador for just 30 guests			1
tomorrow , the prince will visit the @entity193 , where he will lay a wreath on the graves of those who have recently lost their lives in @entity198 and @entity4 as well as the @entity199			0
he will also lay a bouquet of flowers at the grave of legendary murdered former president , @entity204			0
the main focus of his trip , however , will be the 2013 warrior games in @entity63 this weekend which will see more than 200 wounded servicemen – including a 35 - strong @entity179 team – compete in seven sports including archery , cycling and shooting			2
the prince will formally open the games and may even take part in them himself			0
the final leg of his trip will take him to @entity64 , where he will visit an area affected by last year ’s @entity220 , and undertake several engagements in @entity65 including an event on behalf of the @entity223			0
he will be seen boarding an iconic double decker bus to publicise the great campaign , which is promoting @entity179 as one of the best places in the world in which to visit , study and invest in			0
@entity1 will also take part in a baseball game before moving on to @entity68 where he will take part in a celebrity - studded polo match on behalf of his own charity , @entity235 , which he set up to help @entity237 orphans in the impoverished @entity239 kingdom of @entity240			1
unlike other members of the @entity97 , the prince will be taking commercial flights to and from the @entity6 as well as within it , and has a minimal five - strong entourage plus his security detail			1
the cost of his trip will be met largely by his charities but in part by taxpayers as he will be conducting some official business			0
fortunately for his security team , there will be little chance for time off – and certainly no return visit to @entity86 – as he will return to the @entity179 as soon as the trip finishes to resume his military duties .			0

@entity8 visited @entity1 's unit , @entity16 , at his son 's airbase in @entity14 , @entity15 , to honour troops
@entity1 has flown to @entity6 for week - long royal tour , which begins in @entity11
