by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday chief football writer @entity3 will be pleased enough with a comfortable victory over @entity7 qualifiers @entity5 but alarmed by the manner in which spurs almost let the @entity10 side back into the game late on			1
@entity12 looked to be convincing winners until a shaky last 15 minutes – but at least saw @entity14 get his first run out at @entity16 and encouraging displays from @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity19 and @entity21 both established credentials for starting at @entity23 next week by getting on the scoresheet – but @entity20 ’s first half display was the most intriguing			1
the @entity83 looked sharp , bright and ready to impress in the first half , before being one of a number of half - time substitutions			0
@entity20 was involved in the opening goal ’s build up , sweeping the ball to @entity48 , who in turn moved it on to @entity43			2
the former @entity5 player drove in a cross and @entity21 controlled and finished well on 29 minutes			0
but though @entity12 moved the ball well enough , @entity3 was a constant presence on the touchline , cajoling his team , urging them to calm down in possession but apparently not happy with the closing down when attempting to win the ball back			1
with @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and possibly @entity105 to come back into this team and with @entity107 recovering from injury , @entity3 has n’t quite shown his full hand as yet			0
nevertheless there were encouraging signs			0
@entity37 , born in @entity112 but raised in @entity113 and a summer signing from @entity114 , looked comfortable at centre half			1
getting comfortable : @entity12 boss @entity3 watches on during his side 's 2 - 1 win at @entity16 high tackle : @entity55 challenges @entity119 as the @entity12 left - back tries to break forward for the hosts on the scoresheet : @entity123 striker @entity19 doubled @entity12 ' leader in the second half smiles all round : @entity43 rushes to congratulate @entity19 after his quick reactions made it 2 - 0 @entity45 carried on where he left off last season with a fine range of passing , playing in @entity48 on 14 minutes only for @entity5 keeper @entity54 to race from his line to smother the ball			1
and @entity43 should have done better against his old club on 27 minutes but hesitated before shooting , allowing @entity54 to save			2
@entity5 , who start their season their @entity10 campaign in two weeks but who have a domestic cup tie in eight days time , offered little resistance			0
they sauntered through the first half , barely threatening , their only meagre offering being an off - target striker by @entity65 on 45 minutes			0
the raft of half - time substitutions included @entity14 coming on and looking capable enough			0
@entity18 looked bright , coming on for @entity48 , and sprinting away to cross for @entity19 , but the @entity148 lifted his shot well over on 53 minutes			2
out to impress : £ 30m man @entity20 looks to be back to full fitness for @entity12 ahead of the new season familiar face : @entity65 , right , netted @entity5 's goal in the 80th minute of the game @entity18 was less impressive in front of goal , curling a shot wide on 58 minutes when played in by @entity45			1
however , he improved on 68 minutes , unleashing an excellent striker that @entity159 did well to push away			0
first to react though was @entity19 , diving forward to send a looping header back over @entity54 and into the net for 2 - 0			1
however , @entity12 ’s complacency almost allowed a victory to slip away when @entity165 found room down the left to cross for former @entity12 man @entity65 , who stroked the ball home on 80 minutes			2
@entity35 then got a rare touch on 83 minutes , being forced to dive to his right to touch away @entity66 ’s strike .			0

@entity21 put @entity12 ahead with a calm finish in 29th minute
@entity43 could have seen red against his former side for a *lunging* tackle
the @entity12 **midfielder** came close to scoring seven minutes after his *horror* challenge when his left - foot shot was saved well by @entity54
@entity37 made his first start for @entity12 following move from @entity114
young *defender* looked composed at the back for @entity3 's side
@entity20 continued his *resurgence* following his £ 30m move last summer
substitute @entity19 doubled the hosts ' lead with a header
former @entity12 **midfielder** @entity65 made it 2 - 1 late on
