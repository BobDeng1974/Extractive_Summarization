despite not officially being trained by @entity9 , @entity24 ended up losing 12 stone , taking him from over 28 stone to 16 stone trainer @entity9 put @entity1 through a grueling exercise regime as well as overhauling her unhealthy diet @entity24 was n't left out of the weigh - ins with @entity9 , and was soon dropping the pounds as fast as his wife they both then trekked to the peak of @entity60 , despite @entity1 almost having an asthma attack halfway up the mountain			1
as an incentive for the next weigh - in , @entity9 told @entity1 that if she hit 175lbs he would pay for husband @entity24 to have skin removal surgery as well her , which motivated her to lose more and weigh 174lbs ( 12.4 stone ) at the nine month weigh - in			2
