he added that he is not excusing the behavior but does not want the incident to bring more harm to @entity14 troops in @entity10			1
by way of explanation , @entity5 editor @entity165 explained why the paper ran with the photos : ' after careful consideration , we decided that publishing a small but representative selection of the photos would fulfill our obligation to readers to report vigorously and impartially on all aspects of the @entity14 mission in @entity10 , including the allegation that the images reflect a breakdown in unit discipline that was endangering @entity14 troops			1
' this decision has been condemned by officials as it comes at a time when relations between the @entity14 and @entity10 are particularly sensitive due to a string of damaging and embarrassing episodes which have taken place since the start of the year			1
according to the @entity5 , the paratroopers were told to check that @entity10 police had recovered the mangled remains of a suicide bomber in february 2010 and to collect iris scans and fingerprints for identification			2
anger : @entity14 commander in @entity10 , general @entity103 said he strongly condemns the release of the pictures and said a full investigation is underway after they arrived at the police station in @entity207 province , they did what was required but took things one step further - they posed beside the severed legs of the suicide bomber as two @entity10 policemen hold them up for the camera			1

before the pictures were even released , gen @entity103 released a statement saying : ' the actions of the individuals photographed do not represent the policies of @entity246 or the @entity247			2
this behavior and these images are entirely inconsistent with the values of @entity246 and all service members of the fifty @entity246 countries serving in @entity10			0
' we continue to work with our @entity10 and international partners to resolve any issues related to improper treatment of remains			0
this incident is being thoroughly investigated by @entity14 national authorities			2
' these actions undermine the daily sacrifices of thousands of @entity246 troops who continue to serve honorably in @entity10			0
' we will collaborate with @entity10 authorities and carefully examine the facts and circumstances shown in these photos			0
as part of this process , we will determine responsibility and accountability of those involved			0

' the solider who provided the pictures tried to explain the actions of the men in his division by saying all of them had friends or comrades who were killed or wounded by homemade bombs or suicide attacks			0
in the february 2010 mission , the solider said the @entity10 police willingly posed with the platoon and the severed legs because the suicide bomber 's explosives detonated as he tried to attack a police unit			0
on the second mission , to the morgue in @entity47 a few months later , @entity10 police told the platoon that explosives had detonated as three insurgents were preparing a roadside bomb , according to the soldier			0
he told the paper the men felt ' satisfaction ' after learning they were killed by their own explosives			0
' they were frustrated , just pissed off , their buddies had been blown up by @entity314			0
so they sort of just celebrated			0
' lt col @entity316 , an @entity247 spokeswoman , told the @entity5 most of the soldiers had been identified and ' appropriate action ' was being taken			1
in january , a video was released which showed four @entity14 marines urinating on @entity10 corpses and in february , the inadvertent burning of copies of the @entity325 at a @entity14 base triggered riots that left 30 dead and led to the deaths of six @entity14			1
in march , a @entity247 staff sergeant @entity329 allegedly went on a nighttime shooting rampage in two @entity10 villages , killing 17			0
@entity247 staff sgt @entity329 has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and is being held in a military prison at @entity335 , @entity336 , after allegedly going on a shooting spree in an @entity10 village tragedy : @entity340 is accused of shooting 17 @entity10 , including nine children like this one being shown by her grandmother , and setting many of them on fire according to the @entity5 , the soldier who provided them with the photos served in @entity10 with the @entity18 's @entity348 from @entity349 , @entity350			1
he told the paper he was releasing them because he believed the safety of the troops was being compromised due to a breakdown in leadership and discipline			0
@entity246 has a strict policy for the handling of enemy remains and dictates they be processed as humanely as possible			0
the @entity74 press secretary said secretary of defense @entity71 ' strongly rejects the conduct ' of the soldiers depicted in the photos			1
in a statement , @entity14 ambassador to @entity10 @entity68 called the actions in the photographs ' morally repugnant ' , saying they dishonor the sacrifices of hundreds of thousands of @entity14 soldiers and civilians in @entity10			1
captain @entity372 , a @entity74 spokesman , released a statement saying the conduct depicted ' most certainly does not represent the character and the professionalism of the great majority of our troops in @entity10			2
' nevertheless , this imagery — more than two years old — now has the potential to indict them all in the minds of local @entity10 , inciting violence and perhaps causing needless casualties			0
' we have taken the necessary precautions to protect our troops in the event of any backlash			2
