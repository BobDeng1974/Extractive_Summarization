by @entity0 published : 16:50 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 06:16 est , 22 june 2012 plans to end years of dumbing down in schools by replacing gcses with rigorous new o - levels rocked the @entity5 yesterday			1
@entity6 erupted with fury and vowed to block @entity9 ’s proposals – revealed exclusively in yesterday ’s @entity10 – to toughen up exams taken at 16 , saying they would ‘ turn back the clock ’ and should not be allowed to ‘ cater to the few at the top ’			0
the deputy prime minister accused the @entity17 of seeking to send schools back to the 1950s and throw children on ‘ the scrap heap ’ by proposing a new simple @entity21 exam for less able pupils alongside the tough new o - levels			1
determined : education secretary @entity9 said he will publish a consultation document in mid-july setting out plans to scrap gcses and replace them with ' world class exams ' criticism : deputy prime minister @entity6 said the school system ' must be for the many not the few ' while @entity33 schools minister @entity32 said mr @entity9 's plans would create a two - tier system for pupils mr @entity6 said the reform was ‘ not @entity42 policy ’ , and added : ‘ any exam system , any school system , must be for the many not the few			1
’ @entity33 accused mr @entity9 of wanting to bring back a ‘ two - tier system ’ , and teaching unions called the plans ‘ a hugely backwards step which will harm social mobility ’			1
@entity48 threw his weight behind the main thrust of the plans , with his aides revealing that the prime minister is ‘ 100 per cent behind @entity9 ’			1
but the prime minister was also incandescent at the way the story was leaked to the @entity10 before mr @entity9 had even discussed it with the @entity58			0
a source said : ‘ of course @entity48 likes this idea			0
he ’s totally behind @entity9 on these ideas			0
' but he ’s furious with the way it ’s come out because it makes getting the policy through more difficult because it has allowed the @entity58 to publicly entrench themselves			0
’ a defiant mr @entity9 made it clear that despite @entity58 objections he will publish a consultation document in mid-july setting out plans to scrap gcses and replace them with ‘ world class exams ’			1
it will also outline plans to scrap the @entity72 and end the requirement that pupils obtain five good gcses graded a * to @entity76 , which would allow schools to ditch the discredited exams			1
@entity80 pupils have slipped down international league tables in key subjects over the past decade			2
the most authoritative comparison is the @entity84 carried out by the @entity85			0
it is based on tests given to 15 - year - olds in up to 65 countries			2
when first carried out in 2000 , the @entity80 was ranked fourth in science , seventh in literacy and eighth in maths			0
the science ranking fell to 12th in 2003 , 14th in 2006 and 16th in 2009.in literacy the country sank to 11th in 2003 , 17th in 2006 and 25th in 2009			0
the most dramatic slump is in maths , where the ranking was 18th in 2003 , 24th in 2006 and 28th in 2009			0
critics point out that the sample in the survey has grown across the years , from 43 countries in 2000 to 65 in the last study in 2009			2
but , even when this is taken into account , the @entity80 has still slipped proportionately down the tables			0
under @entity9 ’s plans for a revival , pupils will be able to sit the new o - levels at 16 or 17 and the best pupils will be allowed to bypass the exams and go straight to a-levels			1
schools will be given the freedom to enter pupils for the exams when they are ready , rather than forcing everyone to sit them at 16			1
modular study will be abolished , with emphasis put on in - depth work and end of year exams rather than coursework that can be redone until it passes muster			2
pupils studying @entity128 literature will be banned from taking the text of plays into exams and maths pupils will be expected to learn complex subjects such as calculus in order to obtain an a grade			2
mr @entity9 believes the exams need to be tougher to prepare pupils for a-levels , which are also being made more rigorous			2
meanwhile , businesses will be asked to draw up a new @entity21 - style qualification for less able pupils – around one quarter of pupils struggle even to get @entity146 or e grades at @entity147			1
mr @entity9 thinks it is pointless to make those children sit the same o - level as those who are preparing to read a rigorous academic subject at @entity152 or @entity153			2
mr @entity9 can push that change through with a stroke of the pen and without legislation – limiting the @entity58 ’ leverage unless they are prepared to walk out of the @entity5			0
the consultation paper will also outline plans to end the scandal of ‘ competitive dumbing down ’ where exam boards advertise their papers as the easiest to pass			1
instead , contracts will be awarded to just one exam board for each subject			2
the reforms would see pupils starting to study for new o - levels in @entity128 , maths and science in september 2014 , crucially before the next general election			1
but @entity58 made clear that the package of reforms and timetable envisaged by mr @entity9 are untenable			0
mr @entity9 may have to settle for including it in the next @entity179 election manifesto			0
a volcanic row erupted when the plans leaked because mr @entity9 had not even discussed his ideas with @entity183 , the @entity58 minister in his own department , let alone mr @entity6			2
after a tense transatlantic call with the deputy prime minister – who is in @entity188 for a climate change summit – mr @entity6 ’s aides accused the @entity17 of trying to ‘ bounce ’ them into the reforms			0
mr @entity6 himself said : ‘ this was self - evidently not policy that has either been discussed or agreed within the @entity5 government			2
‘ i ’m not in favour of anything that would lead to a two - tier system where children at quite a young age are somehow cast on a scrapheap			1
what you want is an exam system which is fit for the future , does n’t turn the clock back to the past and works for the many and not just for the few			1
’ @entity58 president @entity210 called the plans ‘ madness ’ and said : ‘ let ’s kill off immediately any talk of returning to the divisive two - tier system that mrs @entity215 wisely ended in the late 80s			1
’ @entity58 treasury secretary @entity217 said : ‘ this was not an idea i ’d heard about until i saw it on the front page of a newspaper			2
this might not be an ideal way to form policy			0
’ but @entity179 accused mr @entity6 of ‘ jumping in ’ before he had bothered to examine the details			0
they pointed out that mr @entity9 ’s plan would see 75 per cent of pupils taking o - levels			1
‘ three quarters is “ the many ” , ’ one source said , referring to mr @entity6 ’s ‘ many , not the few ’ comment			0
in the @entity234 , mr @entity9 made a robust case for new rigour in secondary education			0
he said schools already operate a two - tier system because 42 per cent of pupils currently fail to get the five good gcses which employers demand			1
he added : ‘ some of our most impressive schools have already left the gcse behind and opted for the @entity246 or other more rigorous examinations			0
' the sad truth is that at least 40 per cent of children have been left behind under the current system			0
there is no excuse not to act			0
’ @entity33 ’s schools spokesman @entity32 said : ‘ they want to bring back a two - tier exam system designed in the 1950s which will separate children and close off opportunity			1
’ dr @entity257 , leader of the @entity258 , described mr @entity9 ’s plans as ‘ ludicrous ’ , adding : ‘ where is the evidence that this will be an improvement ? ’ @entity262 , general secretary of the @entity263 , said : ‘ @entity9 ’s continual criticism of gcses as a “ dumbed down ” examination is not only incorrect but also very offensive to those pupils and teachers who achieve great results every year			1
‘ getting rid of gcses and replacing them with the old o - level and @entity21 qualifications could easily lower aspirations and exacerbate inequalities in society			1
’ @entity276 , general secretary of the @entity277 , said : ‘ there is no evidence that the current system is broken , that examinations are getting easier or that our qualifications are trailing behind the best in the world			1
@entity9 ’s arrogance is breathtaking			0

education secretary *recommends* simple @entity21 exam for less able pupils
critics say the bold plans would create a two - tier system in schools
