for 50 years the @entity1 carnival march has been accompanied by the sprightly sound of the town â€™s brass band			1
but this year , for the very first time , the band will not be marching			1
they have been stopped in their tracks by potholes			1
concentrating on their instruments and reading music means they will not be able to pay attention to dodging holes in the road			1
danger : councillor @entity19 pictured with the @entity20 in front of potholes in the road concern : the musicians say they could trip over the potholes while playing their instruments the town is already known by locals as a dangerous place to walk or cycle , but the musicians are even more concerned because they are unable to watch the road while reading music			1
the band 's chairman @entity32 has written to @entity34 , saying that the roads are so bad they are pulling out of the @entity36 scheduled for august 9			2
' @entity20 is one of the many organisations in this rural community which provides the glue which holds the community together , ' he wrote			1
' this year is a centenary of the @entity36 and the condition of the roads in the village itself has become too dangerous for our own visiting bands to be able to march safely			1
' the band was originally founded before the @entity50 , and has marched in the parade every year since 1961			1
there are 25 members of the ensemble , many of them in their 70s and one as old as 89			1
anger : @entity59 player @entity58 , centre , is concerned that their instruments could be damaged action : the council has so far failed to fill in the potholes because it does not have enough money @entity59 player @entity58 , who has played with the band for 20 years , said the group had no choice but to cancel their plans			1
' some of these potholes are so big you can see right through the tarmac to the earth below , ' she said			2
' the problem is that we 're looking at our music the whole time so we ca n't see where we 're going			2
we 're not aware at all of what our feet are stepping on			2
' if one of us was to put a foot in a hole we would probably end up losing a tooth and having our instrument damaged beyond repair			0
' we 've got people in their 70s marching - it would n't be very pretty to see them take a tumble			0
' hopefully the council will do something about it before august and we can perform			0
' film : the band 's troubles resemble the plot of the 1996 hit @entity96 , pictured brass bands first emerged in @entity98 in the 19th century , and were originally associated with working - class industrial communities			0
many of the bands had their origins in workplaces - above all coal mines and factories - while others were linked to anti-alcohol temperance movements			0
the @entity108 is also known for its brass bands , which play public concerts to raise money for charitable causes			0
some bands compete in contests , with regional competitions which eventually produce a national champion			0
the standard brass band feature a mixture of cornets , horns , trombones , euphoniums and tubas , as well as drummers			0
they tend to play a mixture of music composed specifically for brass and classical or pop tunes which have been adapted to the band 's capacity			0
the band 's plight bears some resemblance to 1996 film brassed off starring @entity136 , which features a colliery band whose future is threatened by the closure of the coal mines			0
district councillor @entity19 said he was shocked by the news , and urged local authorities to repair the road as quickly as possible			2
' to think that @entity20 may not be in this year 's procession is unbelievable , ' he said			1
' it will be a huge shame if the band does not perform and are obstructed by the plague of potholes in this area			2
' @entity34 admitted that it did not have the resources to deal with the state of the town 's roads			0
' more than 12,000 potholes have been reported by the public or found by highway inspectors so far this year , ' a spokesman said			1
' in response the council has tripled the number of pothole repair teams working across the county			0
' it 's a harsh reality that the council simply does not have the funds to carry out all the works we would wish			0

members of the @entity20 march through the *streets* every year
but they are *refusing* to join the parade because road is covered in potholes
elderly musicians are worried they could trip up while playing instruments
