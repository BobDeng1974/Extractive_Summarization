two property developers branded ' arrogant and greedy ' by a judge have been jailed after a three - storey building collapsed trapping three people in the rubble			1
a doctor 's wife and a student plunged from the living rooms of their flats into the basement below and a workman was buried after a digger struck a load - bearing column			1
the accident left three victims hospitalised with minor injuries , while 20 students were left homeless and one of @entity21 's main arterial roads was closed for a day			1
most of the students who lived in flats above the development in the @entity27 area of the @entity29 city were luckily out at the time and missed the accident			0
jailing brothers @entity33 and @entity34 for 12 months each today , judge @entity31 told them : ' it was only by the grace of @entity37 or good fortune that people were not seriously injured or killed			1
' if a member of the public had been passing by they would have said " how on earth was no - one killed in that ? " there was potential for a complete disaster			1
it was caused by your arrogance and greed			0
' before : students and a doctor and his wife lived above the retail premises in @entity21 until the 2013 incident			1
three people were injured and the building 's collapse caused the main road to be closed off after : but the building was left looking like it had been hit by a bomb after botched work by landlords @entity33 and @entity34 , who were jailed for health and safety offences today officers from the @entity69 spent two years and £ 150,000 investigating the collapse and bringing the defendants to justice for what was called a ' flagrant disregard ' of @entity69 regulations			1
@entity21 @entity76 heard that neither city landlord @entity33 , 33 , or @entity34 , 39 , had any building experience , qualifications or planning permission for the structural works they were carrying out			0
@entity34 , who managed the shop in the building , and @entity33 , the landlord of the flats above , were hoping to extend and reopen a former @entity87 restaurant on the site			1
@entity89 , prosecuting , said the flats above the retail premises were occupied by @entity93 students as well as a doctor and his wife			1
a builder and a structural engineer were consulted over plans to lower the floor level and make the restaurant open - plan but the brothers then dispensed with their services			1
although a planning application was submitted , permission had not been grantedwhen construction work on the restaurant started about four weeks before the collapse in march 2013			1
the student tenants complained about cracks in their walls and noise from drilling and machinery but @entity34 told them the restaurant would be open within four months and he would offer them jobs there			1
@entity33 brought in an excavator and began removing rubble with the help of an odd - job man while @entity34 instructed other workmen			1
pillars and internal walls were removed			2
firemen had to make the building safe after the wall and upper floors caved in in march 2103 the work meant a main road in @entity21 was closed off			2
the section of the building was later demolished as the work progressed , the doctor confronted @entity33 in the basement and was shocked to see the underside of the laminate floor in his flat above supported only by steel beams with large areas of wall removed			2
' he asked @entity138 if he and his wife should vacate the flat but @entity33 assured him this was not necessary , ' said mr @entity89			2
a week later student @entity141 was in his flat when the wall and the floor collapsed , dropping him down onto a pile of rubble in the basement			2
he was trapped by his right leg but a table which fell on top of him protected him from falling debris			2
it was half an hour before he managed to struggle free			0
doctor 's wife @entity154 was sat on the sofa in her lounge			1
' she heard a noise like hailstones and the floor beneath her fell away and she fell to the basement together with a section of the building ' , said mr @entity89			2
she fell on the rubble and was covered in dust as well as being struck by falling pieces of wood			1
both the first and second floors of the buildings collapsed and @entity33 himself freed the handyman , known only as mr @entity173 , from the rubble			2
the students lost their passports and laptops and their deposits on the flats were not returned			0
the part - ruined buildings were demolished by @entity181 on safety grounds - with the taxpayer picking up the bill			2
before the incident , two storeys of flats sat above the premises the brothers were trying to convert an independent structural engineer called in to examine the mess said the work was ' inherently dangerous and a serious accident was foreseeable			2
' mr @entity89 said : ' it was a miracle that nobody was either killed or seriously injured			0
it was pure good luck that most of the tenants were out of their homes and no member of the public was nearby			0
' @entity202 for @entity203 , a father - of - four who was convicted last year of unlawfully evicting a tenant , said the work was not ' wholly cavalier ' from the outset but a measure of cost - cutting overtook prudence			1
' the work was done with a highly reckless disregard not only for the safety of others but to my client himself , ' he said			0
' if there was anybody at the greatest risk it was the one who was in the basement			0
' this was hamfisted , clueless , directionless and haphazard rather than calculated maliciousness in bringing down a building			0
his folly was to think he could turn his hand to this major project without any relevant training or experience			0
' @entity232 , for @entity34 , said his involvement was confined to running the shop in the buildings owned by his father @entity236			0
the court heard had no financial interest in the flats and the intention was for the work to be done properly			0
now builders are trying to completely re-build the premises after huge disruption caused by the accident the court heard the father - of - seven had taken out a £ 488,000 bridging loan on the restaurant project guaranteed by properties belonging to his brother and was currently working as a chef			1
@entity33 and @entity34 both admitted two offences contravening @entity69 regulations in failing to ensure themselves and their employees were not exposed to risk and failing to take steps to prevent danger to another person			0
@entity34 also admitted breaching a prohibition notice			0
as well as being jailed , @entity33 was fined £ 40,000 and @entity34 was given a £ 42,000 fine			0
@entity33 was ordered to pay £ 60,000 costs and @entity34 £ 40,000 costs			0
judge @entity31 told the brothers that their breaches of the regulations were ' blatant and financially motivated '			1
he said : ' people were terrified and there was inconvenience to untold numbers of people in @entity21			0
the potential for disaster was staring everyone in the face apart from you			0

completely *unqualified* brothers were trying to create an @entity87 restaurant
@entity283 then struck load - bearing column bringing down floors and walls
doctor 's wife and student fell through floors and worked was buried
