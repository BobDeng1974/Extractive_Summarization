a raft of ' bizarre ' @entity1 - style by - laws banning activities such as selling lucky heather have been introduced by councils driving into a retail park after 6pm is now a crime under a raft of ' bizarre ' new @entity1 - style by - laws introduced by councils			1
playing music , skateboarding , drinking alcohol in public and even selling lucky heather are among the activities outlawed by local authorities across the country in a drive to restrict freedom , say critics			1
a group which campaigns against excessive regulation said the measures introduced in the @entity23 had created a ' patchwork of criminal law '			1
under @entity27 ( @entity28 ) , an activity that is illegal in one street may not be in the next – creating confusion , the @entity26 has claimed			0
but councils say the orders , which allow them to target anti-social behaviour at a local level , have widespread public support			1
the orders , a form of @entity39 , were first used in december when council chiefs made it a crime for motorists to enter a retail park between 6pm and 6am unless they were using shops or restaurants			2
the aim was to ban up to 500 boy racers who used the @entity49 in @entity50 as a meeting place			0
ministers insist the orders are intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour , such as spitting and aggressive begging			1
but some councils are also planning to apply them to the likes of pigeon feeding , ' nuisance parking ' and children playing ball games outside schools			1
@entity65 chiefs in @entity66 want to ban loitering around cash machines and the sale of lucky charms and heather			2
in @entity73 it is now a crime to enter a tower block if you are under the age of 21 unless you live there or are visiting a resident			0
council bosses are also trying to ban pigeon feeding and taking your dog off their lead			0
playing music , skateboarding and drinking alcohol in public are among the activities outlawed anybody flouting the orders will be liable for a fine , normally ranging from £ 70 to £ 100 , issued by a police officer , police community support officer , council worker or private security guard employed by the local @entity65			1
a @entity95 spokesman said : ' @entity27 ensure that public spaces are not affected by anti-social behaviour so law - abiding people can enjoy them			1
' but @entity100 , director of the @entity26 , said : ' these powers are so broad that they allow councils to ban pretty much anything			2
' the result is a patchwork of criminal law where something is illegal in one street but not the next			1
this makes it hard for the public to know what is criminal and what is not			2
' these orders will turn towns into no - go zones for homeless people , old ladies feeding pigeons , or anyone else the council views as ' messy ' – a return to the meddling and moralism of 19th - century by - laws			1
' people caught urinating in the streets will have to clean up the mess themselves as part of a groundbreaking new scheme			0
instead of being given a fine and facing a court case , offenders will be given the chance to wash the street clean of urine			0
the plan , which was introduced in december in @entity138 , @entity139 , is believed to be the first of its kind in the country and has been welcomed by traders			2
under the scheme , those responsible can meet with a representative of the town 's businesses who explains what it is like to clear up after someone			0
they also spend several hours cleaning the streets – and avoid a fine of up to £ 400			0
one young man who took part in the initiative said : ' i 'm ashamed of what i did			0
i had n't realised how many people are affected			0
