by @entity0 for many women , pregnancy is a joyful time			2
but for @entity3 , a mother - of - one from southern @entity6 , the experience proved to be tougher than she ever could have imagined			1
instead of happily preparing for the arrival of her second child , @entity3 , who was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder at the age of 12 , was plagued with anxiety and paralysed by her fear of getting ill - a fear that left her a virtual recluse			1
now the brave mother has appeared on @entity18 documentary , pregnant and @entity19 , to reveal what living with constant anxiety while expecting is really like			1
nerves : @entity3 , pictured while pregnant with her second child , was left a virtual recluse because of @entity19 ' my ocd was first diagnosed when i was about 12 or 13 years old , ' she explains			1
' my thoughts and worries are always there - they 're constant			2
' i have a fear mostly of illness , so i avoid going out for fear of picking up one of the illnesses that are going around			2
' as a result , @entity3 spends most of her time at home and refuses to let her two - year - old son @entity36 go to the park for fear of germs			1
' we spend most of the days in the house , ' she reveals			0
' most mothers love bringing their kids to the park but i think about the germs that are on [ the slide ] and that shoes have touched it			0
to me , the park represents a dirty place			0
' for husband @entity50 , @entity3 's ocd and the impact it has on their son is a constant source of concern			1
fearful : @entity3 's fears include a terror of illness and of dirt , and as a result , she constantly washes her hands uncomfortable : @entity3 , pictured with mother @entity64 , was unable to enjoy her baby shower for fear of illness ' the ocd is a lot worse [ since she became pregnant ] and it 's really stressful , ' he explains			1
' she 's turned @entity36 into a bubble boy and she does n't really want him doing anything			0
' he does n't understand what 's going on in @entity75 's head			0
' ' i would definitely say the @entity19 has kept me in a prison , ' adds @entity3			1
' my thoughts and my fears that have to do with @entity19 become much worse with pregnancy			1
' i 've pretty much confined myself to the house except for when i need to go out			0
i worry about diseases like the @entity83			0
i wash my hands too many times to count			0
' although @entity3 usually takes medication to control her symptoms , she refused to do so while pregnant - an attitude that also extended to the period spent breastfeeding when baby son @entity92 was born			1
' newborns are less protected so i worry about all that stuff , ' she explains			0
' i do n't want to breastfeed and take that medication at the same time			2
concern : since becoming a mother for the second time , @entity3 has vowed to start taking medication again frightening : @entity3 's ocd has made her reluctant to allow interaction between her two young sons ' the doctors say that lots of people do and they 're fine but i 'm unsure			1
' her ocd even has an impact on the interaction she allows between her sons , with @entity36 regarded as a potential source of infection			2
' when @entity36 is interacting with @entity92 , i do n't really like him to touch his face with his hands , ' she admits			0
' he might have germs on his hands			0
' since having @entity92 , however , the mother - of - two has made it her mission to overcome the disease for the sake of her sons and has started a new course of medication - despite being fearful of the effect it could have on her children			1
' i want to get better and i 'm trying to , ' she explains			0
' i hope that when the medication starts working , i 'm going to feel a lot happier and less anxious			2
' normal : @entity3 and husband @entity50 are desperate to give their sons as normal an upbringing as possible ' when she was pregnant i did n't think it could get any worse than what it was before , but it has , ' adds husband @entity50			1
' i hope @entity36 and @entity92 will be able to do what other boys do and go outside and get dirty and messy like little boys do			0
' ' i do n't want my boys to see the world as a place that 's full of threats , ' says @entity3			2
' i do n't want them to worry about things like i do			0
' i want them to see the world as a good place and i just want them to be happy			0
' @entity3 and @entity50 appear on pregnant and @entity19 , tonight at 9pm on @entity18			1
