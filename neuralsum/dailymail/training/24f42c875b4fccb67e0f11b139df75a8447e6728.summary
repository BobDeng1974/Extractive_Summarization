the childhood past - time has resurged in popularity as a means of keeping fit in recent years			1
but now the trend has been given a new twist in the form of a pop up class in @entity15 where hundreds of fitness fans got into the groove in unison			1
organised by the website fitness - freak.com , the pop up classes at @entity15 's @entity21 were lead by ' @entity23 '			1
get into the groove : @entity25 the @entity26 from @entity28 's @entity27 led the hula hooping pop up event all body workout : mastering the technique can improve core strength and flexibility she 's a globe - trotting ' hoop master ' who can spin 133 hoops around her body at the same time and was once a finalist on @entity28 ’s @entity27			1
@entity42 , who writes the blog @entity41 attended the class and said it was a fun but effective workout			0
she writes : ' our masterclass began with a @entity25 talking us through the basics , most of us in the room openly admitted we were novices , so we learnt how to keep the hoop spinning			0
optimistically we all tried to keep our hoops up and our pelvises rocking whilst @entity55 warbled on for a whole track			0
' @entity25 taught us lots of tricks ... spinning one hoop above our heads , whilst whittling our waists at the same time			0
' fun fitness : @entity63 can burn 400 calories an hour and you can do it in your own home if you ca n't get to an organised class she added : ' if you turned up expected a high intensity sweat fest then you were always going to disappointed			1
that said , i definitely felt it in my abs and thighs the next day and you only have to look at @entity23 to see how good hula hooping is for you , she is a walking testament			1
' @entity75 , 65 , became another ' walking testament ' to the hobby when she famously swung a hoop round her slim waist while performing at the @entity79 last year			0
@entity63 is under - going a revival thanks to pop up classes like this as it actually dates back centuries			1
there 's evidence that the @entity87 and ancient @entity88 whirled hoops around their waists for fun and fitness			0
@entity95 's pop up events were so successful they have organised another class in @entity97 , @entity98 on 9th december			2
meanwhile , smaller classes are regularly held at gyms across the capital and other parts of the @entity28			0
and while those who attend group workouts will attest it 's more fun trying to whirl a hoop round your waist while in the company of your friends , you can of course gain the benefits of hula hooping by doing it in your own home			0
in the swing of it : this month 's pop up events were so popular another is planned in december twirl yourself fit : there are hula hooping classes on offer around the @entity28 all you need is a hoop - that can be bought weighted for a more intense work out - and enough room to swing			1
master the technique and you 'll get an all body workout strengthening your abs and core , improving your flexibility and raising your heart rate			1
as a result , a study by the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) found that more than 400 calories can be burned in an hour by hula hooping			1
@entity141 , one of the researchers who worked on the @entity137 study concluded : ' @entity144 compares pretty favourably with most other group classes , in terms of heart rate and calorie burn			1
' star fans : @entity75 swung a hoop round her slim waist as she performed in 2012 while @entity152 is pictured hula hooping on the lawn of the @entity155 , right he added : ' before we did the study , i did n't imagine the heart - rate averages would be so high			2
i was really impressed by how intense of a workout you can get hooping and how many calories you can burn			2
' the only way is @entity167 star @entity166 told the @entity168 earlier this year that she 's ' hooked ' on hula hooping after taking up a regular class similar to the @entity95 pop up that involves combining hula moves to music			2
she said : ' i loved hula hooping as a child but i 'd completely forgotten how much fun it is ' " dance hooping " takes it to a whole new level and it works out my entire body out , strengthening my core and burning calories as well as , if not better than , any other boring exercise			2
