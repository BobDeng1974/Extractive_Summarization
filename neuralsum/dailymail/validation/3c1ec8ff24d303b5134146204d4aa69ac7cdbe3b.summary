a momentous and valuable piece of our evolutionary history has gone on display to the public			0
the 2.8 million - year - old partially complete lower jaw , uncovered in the @entity6 of @entity7 , is thought to belong to a species that may have been the first member of the @entity11 family			1
it is significant because it suggests our first human ancestors emerged 400,000 years earlier than previously thought			1
the fossil is now encased in a glass box at the @entity17			2
the fossilised remains were put on display inside a glass case at @entity17 earlier this week it was unveiled at a press conference by professor @entity25 , one of the palaeontologists who made the discovery in january 2013			1
scientists say the fossil , which is known as @entity30 350 - 1 , is recognisably human but also has more primitive features that suggests it is older than other fossils belonging to the @entity11 family			1
this would make it the common ancestor for modern humans - @entity37 - and their extinct relatives including @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			1
researchers who have digitally reconstructed the jaws of other ancient human ancestors say the fossil also matches what they would expect from this common ancestor			1
55 million years ago - first primitive primates evolve 15 million years ago - @entity51 ( great apes ) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon 8 million years ago - first gorillas evolve			2
later , chimp and human lineages diverge 5.5 million years ago - @entity58 , early ‘ proto - human ’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas 4 million years ago - @entity60 appeared			2
they had brains no larger than a chimpanzee 's 2.8 million years ago - @entity30 350 - 1 appeared and may be the first of the @entity11 family 2.7 million years ago - @entity66 , lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing 2.3 million years ago - @entity69 habalis first thought to have appeared in @entity70 1.8 million years ago - @entity71 begins to appear in fossil record 1.6 million years ago - @entity74 axes become the first major technological innovation 800,000 years ago - early humans control fire and create hearths			1
brain size increases rapidly 400,000 years ago - @entity42 first begin to appear and spread across @entity80 and @entity81 200,000 years ago - @entity37 - modern humans - appear in @entity70 40,0000 years ago - modern humans reach @entity80 the discovery , which was found in the @entity87 - @entity86 area of @entity6 , has put a new date on the emergence of the first ' man ' from our more ape - like ancestors			1
dr @entity93 , from the @entity94 , @entity95 , helped lead the fossil hunters , said : ' in spite of a lot of searching , fossils on the @entity69 lineage older than two million years ago are very rare			1
' to have a glimpse of the very earliest phase of our lineage ’s evolution is particularly exciting			0
' @entity30 350 - 1 reveals that many of the anatomical patterns we see in 2 million - year old @entity109 were established much earlier in the evolution of the genus			1
' at 2.8 million years ago we see relatively evolved @entity69 traits in combination with other much more primitive anatomical features			1
' the researchers , whose work on the fossil is published in the journal @entity119 , say the fossil could be a key missing link between the @entity69 lineage and a more primitive and ape - like rival branch of the hominin evolutionary tree called @entity126			2
details of the @entity126 are best known from a fossil named ‘ @entity129 ’ , dating back 3.2 million years , which was discovered in @entity7 in 1974			2
but exactly how @entity40 had appeared was unclear due to a huge gap in the fossil record			1
the new discovery has helped to fill that gap			2
scientists say it can provide important clues to the changes in jaw and teeth that distinguished members of the @entity11 family from those belonging to @entity126			1
until now the earliest evidence of the existence of the first @entity69 species was 2.3 million to 2.4 million year old fossils			1
scientists have been searching for decades for earlier examples in an attempt to understand how our ancestors split from other ape - like hominins			2
dr @entity153 , director of the @entity154 at @entity155 who was also involved in the research , said : ' the @entity87 jaw helps narrow the evolutionary gap between @entity126 and early @entity109			0
' it ’s an excellent case of a transitional fossil in a critical time period in human evolution			0
' the bone was unveiled at a press conference by professor @entity25 ( pictured ) , one of the palaeontologists who made the discovery in january 2013			0
scientists say the fossil , known as @entity30 350 - 1 , is recognisably human but also has more primitive features that suggests it is older than other fossils belonging to the @entity11 family the fossilised lower jawbone , shown above with teeth still in the bone , was found in @entity86 in @entity7 the fossilised jawbone was first discovered by student @entity178 from the @entity179 in @entity7 in january 2013			1
until now , the earliest evidence of the existence of the first @entity69 species was 2.3 million to 2.4 million - year - old fossils			1
the jawbone is pictured it is thought to be the left side of an adult 's lower jawbone that has canine , premolars and three molars still preserved in the jaw			0
mr @entity178 said he was ‘ stunned ’ when he saw the fossil			0
‘ the moment i found it , i realised that it was important , as this is the time period represented by few fossils in @entity70 , ’ he told @entity194 last night			0
dating of the fossil and the surrounding sediment suggest it is between 2.8 million and 2.75 million years old			0
other fossils of antelope , prehistoric elephants and hippos discovered alongside the jawbone suggest that this early @entity69 species lived in open grassland and shrub habitats			1
this matches the picture that scientists believe was occurring around this time of climate change creating increasingly arid conditions in @entity70			0
these are thought to be one of the main driving forces that led to the evolution of the @entity69 lineage and eventually our own species			2
@entity126 , by contrast , was thought to inhabit far wetter environments and this may have contributed to their eventual demise			0
the researchers said that the changes in the new jawbone compared to @entity126 suggest that evolution of different jaw shapes may have been a key step in the divergence of the two lineages			0
professor @entity25 , also from @entity155 , said : ' we can see the 2.8 million year aridity signal in the @entity239 faunal community , but it ’s still too soon to say that this means climate change is responsible for the origin of @entity109			0
' the images above show the jawbone from different angles and how many of the teeth still remain in place anthropologists digging tin the @entity251 , pictured above , discovered the new jawbone in january 2013 the new fossil has helped fill a huge gap in the evolutionary history ( above ) of how the @entity11 family appeared another study published in the journal @entity258 has also provided convincing evidence that ld 350 - 1 was a common human ancestor to the @entity11 family			1
the jawbone was found in the @entity87 - @entity86 area , marked with a star on the map above , of @entity7 they used 3d imaging techniques to scan partial skull of @entity40 - a human ancestor that lived 1.8 million years ago and is thought to have been among the first to use tools - earning it the nickname ' handy man '			2
it reveals an unexpectedly primitive structure , indicating that the species may have originated at least 2.3 million years ago and allowed the researchers to draw conclusions about what their ancestors jaw would have looked like			2
their findings suggest that three different species of early human existed side - by - side between 2.1 million and 1.6 million years ago - @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity285			0
scientists used 3d imaging techniques to reconstruct the skull of @entity289 ( left ) which has provided clues about how this now extinct member of our evolutionary branch would have looked			0
the image on the right shows an early reconstruction of @entity109 hablis at the @entity297 in @entity298 they found that the ancestor of @entity40 would have had features similar to those found in the fossilised jawbone @entity30 350 - 1			1
professor @entity304 , a researcher of evolutionary anatomy at @entity306 and the @entity307 in @entity308 , said : ' by digitally exploring what homo habilis really looked like we could infer the nature of its ancestor , but no such fossils were known			0
' now the @entity87 - @entity86 jaw has turned up as if ‘ on request ’ , suggesting a plausible evolutionary link between @entity317 and @entity40			0
' this reconstruction of the jaw of @entity40 by the @entity306 team shows that it was more primitive than the jaws of @entity41 or homo sapiens and was more similar to the jaw of @entity317 dr @entity325 , an anthropologist at @entity326 , said the discovery of @entity30 350 - 1 could help scientists unravel the complex beginnings of our own species			1
he said : ' it gives us a better understanding of what was happening at the earlier end of the @entity109			0
' finds like @entity338 ( a 3.5 million year old ape - like species ) have made it harder to understand the relationship between the @entity60 and us - in short it ’s the replacement of the old fashioned unilinear model of a evolutionary branch with a multiple species based evolutionary bush			0
' what ’s becoming clear is that we have only a small part of the jigsaw puzzle			0
this new fossil may well be a member of our genus , an australopithecine or an hitherto unknown genus			0

@entity356 - known as @entity30 350 - 1 - was discovered in @entity6 of @entity7
the fossil is on display inside a glass case at @entity17
it is though to have belonged to the earliest member of the @entity11 family
it means that the @entity11 family emerged 400,000 years earlier than believed
scientists think it could represent a common ancestor for all @entity69 species
the jaw shares features with other @entity69 fossils but is also more primitive
@entity376 has helped fill a huge gap in the fossil record of our evolution
scientists say it could provide new clues about how our species evolved
