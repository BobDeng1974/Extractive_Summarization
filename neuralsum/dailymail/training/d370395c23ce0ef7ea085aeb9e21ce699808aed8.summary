@entity0 has been a maligned figure at times in his @entity4 career but the attacking midfielder 's dominant display in the 5 - 0 victory over @entity8 was one of his best yet on these shores			1
the 26 - year - old was almost flawless at the @entity12 ; his intricate passing combined perfectly with @entity14 and @entity15 in midfield while his movement in the final third was clever , causing confusion in a @entity8 defence that was concerned enough with the speed of @entity22			0
it took only eight minutes for @entity0 to show he was on form			0
@entity0 ( right ) was in fine form for @entity4 as they beat @entity8 5 - 0 on sunday @entity0 ( right ) was in brilliant form for @entity4 and assisted their opener in superb style @entity0 ( left ) constantly caused an array of problems for @entity8 , who are a side he enjoys playing against @entity0 's heat map in the attacking third of the pitch was impressive , particularly down the left of the pitch as his @entity40 counterpart @entity39 hooked the ball clear from the penalty area and into the direction of @entity0 , who was just inside his own half , the midfielder took a small glance to his left as he turned towards the high ball			1
the look sent @entity48 running , and @entity0 stuck his left leg out to artistically flick the ball into the path of the onrushing striker , who closed in on @entity53 and lifted the ball over him for @entity4 's lead			1
it was a sublime touch to send the ball gliding through the @entity8 back line and an ominous sign for @entity60 that with one swish of @entity0 's left boot , his side 's defence was unlocked			2
after half an hour , @entity0 capped a fine passing move with @entity14 by guiding the ball beyond @entity53 , but his strike was ruled out for offside			0
it was a tight decision but the @entity71 winner , who hit the opening goal when @entity4 beat @entity8 3 - 0 in september , was not to be nullified for the duration of the encounter			2
he doubled @entity4 's lead on 56 , @entity48 this time the provider by playing a neat ball into the run of the attacking midfielder for him to tuck the ball beyond @entity53 and into the far corner			1
it was the goal his performance had merited , but neither he nor @entity4 were done			0
seven minutes later , @entity22 finished brilliantly from the edge of the penalty area to signal his own return to form and fitness after injury , before a @entity14 penalty squirmed away from @entity53 and @entity90 curled in from range in the final minute			0
@entity48 scores @entity4 's opening goal after latching on to a brilliant flick from @entity0 @entity0 celebrates hitting the back of the net for his side 's second goal of the game against @entity8 @entity0 ( left ) celebrates with @entity14 ( right ) after scoring @entity4 's fourth goal from the penalty spot but the performance of @entity0 will be most encouraging for manager @entity102			1
today , @entity0 played with the authority of a @entity71 winner and the style of a man who cost Â£ 42.5million			0
@entity4 are outside of the top four and have plenty of work to do to secure a @entity111 place , so the return of @entity0 is timely			2
he has made no secret of the fact he has hit the gym in order to be able to cope with the physical demands of the @entity119 and after recovering from a knee injury against @entity121 sustained in october that ruled him out until last month , today 's performance could signal an upturn in his fortunes at @entity4 .			1

@entity0 brilliantly assisted @entity48 's opening goal for @entity4
