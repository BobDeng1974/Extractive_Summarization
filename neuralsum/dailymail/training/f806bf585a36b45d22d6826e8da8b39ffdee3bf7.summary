by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and @entity2 follow @ @ @entity3 should @entity4 keep the class of ' 92 at @entity6 ? @entity7 is set to be confirmed as @entity6 ’s manager on wednesday and will bring his extensive @entity10 backroom staff with him to @entity11			1
the 62 - year - old will be joined at @entity6 by former @entity14 striker @entity13 , goalkeeping coach @entity15 , fitness coach @entity16 and analyst @entity17			1
however , their arrival means the club ’s famous class of 92 face uncertain futures			2
the roles for interim manager @entity24 and coaches @entity25 , @entity27 and @entity28 are up in the air , and they may be forced to take on junior roles or - in the worst - case scenario - move on altogether			2
new boss : @entity7 will be appointed as @entity6 manager next week undecided : @entity24 and the class of ' 92 's role next season is not yet known it is expected that @entity4 ’s appointment will be announced after @entity6 have played their final home game of the season against @entity40 on tuesday night			1
@entity24 has helped provide stability in the 10 days since @entity43 ’s sacking ; he has impressed with how he has handled the role of caretaker manager and thrived with the responsibility but it is unclear how he will fit into the @entity4 set - up			2
@entity25 would be expected to move back to his role in charge of @entity6 ’s under 18s yet less certain is what lies in store for @entity27 , who is not on a contract , and @entity28 , who was brought back to @entity11 by @entity43 last summer			1
of the quartet , @entity28 is arguably the most vulnerable			0
goalkeeping coach @entity56 could also go given @entity4 ’s preference to work with @entity15			0
though @entity4 is very much his own man when making decisions , he is also someone who pays attention to club history , which suggests he would be willing to work closely with @entity24 or @entity25			0
@entity61 , another @entity4 ally , will not be making the move to @entity63 as he is set to continue with @entity14 after signing a new contract with the @entity10 football federation			1
own team : current @entity14 assistant @entity13 could come to @entity11 with @entity4 investment : @entity4 will be given money to spend after @entity6 failed to qualify for the @entity69 incoming : @entity70 keeping tabs : video analyst @entity72 controversy ? @entity4 wants goalkeeping coach @entity15 to join but @entity56 has performed well meanwhile , @entity6 fear @entity73 has suffered another injury setback after the striker limped out of training on thursday and was sent for a scan			1
it is unclear if the problem is connected with the injury he suffered in the @entity69 match against @entity84 at @entity11 a month ago when he chipped a bone in his foot and required a painkilling injection to play			0
@entity6 will assess the 28 - year - old ’s condition today before deciding if he can face @entity90 at home on saturday			1
however , with @entity6 having little left to play for in their remaining three games , they are unlikely to risk @entity73 if there is any doubt about his fitness			0
the @entity99 striker will also be reluctant to take any chances with the @entity101 looming after going into the last two tournaments under an injury cloud			0
@entity104 team coach - @entity106 @entity10 striker who shot to fame as a member of @entity4 ’s @entity69 - winning side with @entity111 in 1995 , when he scored the winning goal against @entity113 in the final at the age of 18			1
he teamed up again with his mentor at @entity117 in 1998			0
following his retirement in 2008 , @entity13 was recruited by @entity4 to coach his strikers at @entity120 , and then appointed as an assistant when he took charge of the @entity10 national team in 2012			0
@entity15 - goalkeeping coach - @entity126 of @entity4 ’s longest - serving and most trusted lieutenants , the former @entity125 goalkeeper has worked at @entity111 , @entity117 , @entity84 and the @entity10 national team , and has overseen the development of the likes of @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			2
@entity15 has written various books on the training methods of goalkeepers			0
@entity139 @entity138 senior member of @entity4 ’s backroom team who has worked with him in @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity14 , and is trusted with full responsibility for the medical department			0
@entity147 @entity10 first worked with @entity4 at @entity120 and then followed his boss to @entity84 , where he spent the next two years as his chief anaylst , a role he has subsequently carried out for the @entity10 national team under @entity4 since 2012			2
@entity152 : @entity154 forward @entity153 is being eyed by @entity4 as part of his new look @entity6 on the move ? @entity84 midfielder @entity158 has been on @entity6 's wishlist for some time			1

@entity7 will be named as @entity6 's new boss next week
the @entity10 is expected to be announced as manager after @entity6 's final home game against @entity165
the 62 - year - old will take over once @entity14 's @entity101 campaign is finished
