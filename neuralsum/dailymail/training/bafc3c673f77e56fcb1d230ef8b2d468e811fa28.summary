by @entity0 a landmark step towards the creation of artificial life has been taken by scientists who have built a functioning synthetic yeast chromosome			1
their achievement breaks new ground by taking the emerging field of synthetic biology beyond the limits of bacteria and viruses			2
the scientists improved upon the design of the yeast chromosome by stripping out ‘ junk ’ dna and said the technique can be used to give chromosomes new properties			1
chromosomes are tiny packages of @entity14 that contain the genes in which the ' book of life ' is written			2
a sample of the yeast is pictured chromosomes are thread - like structures located inside the nucleus of animal and plant cells			1
each one is made of protein and a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid or dna , which contains the specific instructions that make each type of living creature unique			1
chromosomes vary in number and shape among living things			0
most bacteria have one or two circular chromosomes , but humans , along with other animals and plants , have linear chromosomes that are arranged in pairs within the nucleus of the cell			0
while the research is in its early stages , it could lead to artificial strains of yeast being used in medicine , vaccines and even biofuels			1
chromosomes are tiny packages of @entity14 that contain the genes in which the ' book of life ' is written			2
previously , scientists have built artificial versions of bacterial chromosomes , as well as viral dna , but this is the first time the chromosome of a eukaryote - a higher organism whose cells contain nuclei , unlike bacteria - has been created			1
unlike genetic engineering , which involves transferring genes from one organism to another , synthetic biology involves designing and then constructing new genetic material from scratch			1
@entity89 synthetic biology pioneer dr @entity87 , director of the @entity90 , said : ‘ our research moves the needle in synthetic biology from theory to reality			1
‘ this work represents the biggest step yet in an international effort to construct the full genome of synthetic yeast			2
’ writing in the journal @entity103 , the team describes how the chromosome - dubbed ' @entity104 ' - was constructed and successfully incorporated into brewer 's yeast			1
while the research is in its early stages , it could lead to artificial strains of yeast being used in medicine , vaccines and even biofuels			1
one company in @entity117 has already used synthetic biology to create a strain of yeast that can produce artemisinin , which is an ingredient for an anti-malarial drug			0
a mosquito is pictured scientists removed redundant parts of the ' real ' chromosome			2
this reduced the size of the synthetic chromosome by around 15 per cent			0
they made further changes to the genetic code to introduce variations in the chromosome different to those in the original one			2
they then integrated their ' synlll ' creation into a living yeast cell and showed that the cells were ' remarkably normal '			0
the chromosome is the most extensively altered ever made			0
dr @entity87 said they behave almost identically to wild yeast cells but with their new capabilities they can do things that wild yeast can not			0
@entity149 is involved in the international effort to synthesise 16 yeast chromosomes and last year the government dedicated £ 1million to the yeast project out of its £ 60million budget for synthetic biology			0
the seven - year - long project involved piecing together some 273,871 dna components			0
the scientists also tweaked nature 's design by removing repeated dna sections thought to be unnecessary to reproduction and growth			1
regions of ‘ junk ’ dna that appeared to perform no function were taken out , as well as ‘ jumping gene ’ segments known to move around randomly and introduce mutations			0
‘ when you change the genome you 're gambling , ’ said dr @entity87			0
‘ one wrong change can kill the cell			0
‘ we have made over 50,000 changes to the dna code in the chromosome and our yeast still alive			1
it shows that our synthetic chromosome is hardy , and it endows the yeast with new properties			1
’ sixty undergraduate students were recruited to tie together short snippets of the synthetic dna into stretches 750 to 1,000 units long			0
it was only in 2010 that dr @entity189 created the first synthetic genome for bacteria and this latest research has sparked an on - going international mission to reconstruct the entire yeast genome over the next few years			1
@entity195 was chosen for synthesis because it is among the smallest of the 16 yeast chromosomes			0
it controls how yeast cells ‘ mate ’ and undergo genetic change			0
it was only in 2010 that dr @entity189 created the first synthetic genome for bacteria and this latest research ( dr @entity87 is pictured with a researcher ) has sparked an on - going international mission to reconstruct the entire yeast genome over the next few years medicine : scientists could make synthetic chromosomes for yeast cells to speed up the rate of yeast evolution			1
this means that they could create strains designed for use in certain complex medicines			0
a company in @entity117 has already used synthetic biology to create a strain of yeast that can produce artemisinin , an ingredient for an anti-malarial drug			0
biofuels : the scientists said that new types of yeast chromosomes could improve the efficiency of producing biofuels , made in the fermenting process			1
the organism shares roughly a third of its 6,000 genes - stretches of dna that encode for proteins - with humans			2
large sections of yeast dna were manipulated by the scientists using a ‘ scrambling ’ technique that involves shuffling genes like a deck of cards			2
‘ we can pull together any group of cards , shuffle the order and make millions and millions of different decks , all in one small tube of yeast , ’ dr @entity87 added			0
‘ now that we can shuffle the genomic deck , it will allow us to ask : can we make a deck of cards with a better hand for making yeast survive under any of a multitude of conditions , such as tolerating higher alcohol levels			2
’ the research paves the way to synthetic strains of yeast that could be used in the manufacture of medicines or vaccines			1
synthetic yeast could also bolster the development of efficient biofuels , the scientists claim			1
one company in @entity117 has already used synthetic biology to create a strain of yeast that can produce artemisinin , which is an ingredient for an anti-malarial drug , the @entity271 reported .			0

this is the first time the chromosome of a higher organism whose cells contain nuclei - unlike bacteria - has been created
scientists from @entity90 removed ' junk ' @entity14 thought to be unnecessary to reproduction and growth
they made 50,000 changes to the dna code to make the chromosome dubbed ' @entity104 ' tougher and give it new properties
synthetic strains of yeast could be used in medicines and biofuels
