tripped up by technology : @entity1 who accidentally sent a sex text to all his contacts and ended up in jail @entity1 must have thought things could n’t get any worse after he accidentally sent a saucy text message intended for a lover to every contact in his phonebook			1
how wrong he was ! the 24 - year - old swimming coach ended up in prison for sex offences after the text also found its way to two young schoolgirls			0
@entity1 had typed an intimate invitation to his girlfriend asking her if she would like to engage in sex with him ‘ skin on skin ’			1
excruciatingly , a slip of the fingers on his @entity24 smartphone resulted in it going out via @entity25 to all the numbers on his phone			0
but as well as having to deal with the humiliation of his family reading the message , @entity1 ’s mistake led to far more serious consequences			2
among the recipients of the text were two girls aged 13 and 14 , which led to @entity1 , who teaches swimming in a leisure centre , being arrested and charged with causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity			1
he was jailed for 18 months at @entity40 in july			1
the story unfolded in court this week when his lawyers went to the @entity44 in @entity45 to have his conviction overturned			0
they argued that @entity1 ’s ‘ misguided use of his blackberry ’ made it ‘ difficult to conclude that he was targeting anyone ’			2
bad mistake : a slip of the fingers on his @entity24 smartphone resulted in it going out via @entity25 to all the numbers on his phone in the message , @entity1 , of @entity59 , asked an unknown lover if they would have sex with him ‘ skin on skin ’ and whether they would prefer it to be ‘ fast or slow ’			2
granting the appeal , @entity68 said the circumstances were ‘ unusual ’ and agreed that @entity1 had been ‘ evidently misguided ’ in the use of his phone			0
he added : ‘ the facts of this case are rather unusual			0
messages ... were sent to every single contact in his phone , including members of his own family			1
’ quashed : mr @entity1 walked free from the @entity44 in @entity45 after judges accepted his ' misguided use of his @entity24 ' he added : ‘ the fact that they were repeated shows that he was evidently misguided in the use of his @entity24			2
‘ it is difficult to conclude that he was targeting anyone			0
‘ there were a number of mitigating factors in this case			0
’ the judge , sitting with mr @entity94 and mrs @entity95 , added that the sentence , which he also reduced to nine months , would be suspended ‘ given the unusual circumstances ’ and freed @entity1 .			1

@entity1 , 24 , had been jailed for 18 months for inciting a child to engage in sexual activity
freed after judges hear the messages went out to all his contacts including members of his own family
