by @entity0 published : 15:12 est , 23 february 2013 updated : 16:04 est , 23 february 2013 an @entity2 airline worker returned to his car following six weeks abroad only to discover a nest on the rear windscreen wiper			1
with a brooding bird sitting on eggs			2
@entity8 , arrived at @entity9 following a trip to @entity11			1
he went to the staff car park to pick up his vehicle and found a female @entity14 perilously perched on the back of his @entity18 - incubating her eggs			2
the female @entity14 was found nesting her eggs on the back windscreen wipers of mr @entity8 's car @entity8 said in an interview with @entity24 : ' at first i thought it was just trying to " blend in , " then i noticed it looked like it was trying to make a nest			1
' as i got closer it appeared it was not about to fly away			0
my colleague put his hand right up to it 's face , and that 's when it raised its wings and exposed those eggs			0
' after spending an hour on the phone with wildlife experts , @entity8 took up the offer from a colleague of a ride home and offered to leave , both , his car and the the nest alone for the few weeks it was hoped it would take for the eggs to hatch			1
the eggs were moved but the mother could not be found			1
experts say that she is likely to produce more eggs very soon he added : ' the next day i got a call from the airport to say that the wildlife officials had come and removed the nest as its location was deemed to be far from ideal , and that i could come and collect my car			1
' the eggs have been taken to an incubator and the mother was unable to be caught and taken with them , though they figured she would probably lay again in the very near future			2
' the nesting mother used @entity73 ribbon to create her nest on a traffic light just last month baffled motorists in @entity77 found a bird incubating eggs on an amber traffic light			1
the bird , which was either a mistle or song thrush , had even used some @entity73 wrapping to make its nest			0
the light may seem an unusual place to nest , but its warmth provides heat for the eggs photographer @entity89 , 40 , from @entity77 said : ' there were a lot of people standing around looking at this bird , i suppose it thought it had the green light to start nesting so early			2
' if you look closely you can see ribbon from what might be @entity73 wrapping in with the twigs in the nest ' i was there for about half an hour and the bird seemed pretty happy and oblivious to all the commotion around it			0
' @entity103 from thr @entity104 said : ' birds make their nests in all sorts of unusual places , and this is n't the first traffic light nest we 've seen - in the past we 've had birds nesting in , bins , hanging baskets and even an ash tray outside a pub. ' it may seem odd to us , but it 's actually quite common			0
they see a safe , secure and cosy spot to lay eggs and raise chicks and do n't care what it looks like or what the neighbours might think			0
' the @entity104 recommends putting out high energy foods in gardens to help your birds get through the winter			0
a supply of unfrozen , fresh water is also really important			0

@entity8 returned to his car at @entity9 to find the bird in a nest
he offered to leave the car for weeks until the eggs hatched
*authorities* moved the eggs but could not find the mother to take to them
