@entity1 ' plan for a special ' select committee ' charged with investigating the 2012 @entity4 terror attack reached new levels of controversy on wednesday when the congressman who will chair the new panel said he can foresee its work stretching well into the 2016 election season			1
rep. @entity12 , a former @entity13 prosecutor , acknowledged on @entity14 that the timetable would largely be dictated by how much – or how little – the @entity17 administration cooperates with subpoenas			1
' it would be shame on us if we intentionally dragged this out for political expediency , ' said @entity12 , ' on the other hand , if an administration is slow - walking document production , i ca n’t end a trial simply because the defense wo n’t cooperate			1
' continuing the high - powered spectacle of a no - holds - barred congressional probe into the presidential race could bring new levels of public scrutiny to former secretary of state @entity35 , the @entity37 ' current front - runner in the @entity39 contest			1
@entity43 ( @entity44 ) and @entity45 ( r ) , is gearing up to gavel in a select committee on @entity4 as the terror attack and its still - unanswered questions become a deafening rally cry on the right former secretary of state @entity35 's expected @entity37 presidential campaign could suffer if the @entity1 - led @entity4 select committee drags its work into 2016 @entity35 has not yet committed to running			1
it was on her watch that the @entity58 ambassador to @entity59 and three other @entity58 personnel died on september 11 , 2012 when heavily armed members of an @entity63 group linked with @entity64 launched an all - out assault on @entity58 diplomatic facilities in @entity4 , an eastern port city in @entity59			2
republicans began pushing last week for a more powerful @entity68 that would take over from the four standing committees that have investigated the terror attack with limited results			0
the new body will have subpoena power and promises to consolidate congressional investigations so that the same group of lawmakers can interrogate witnesses who would normally be under the jurisdiction of different committees			0
unlike with the @entity83 committees , which have done the lion 's share of the heavy lifting so far , select committee members can question witnesses as long as they like – ditching the customary five - minute timer and removing the incentive for stalling			2
with the threat of a 7 - 5 disadvantage in committee membership hanging over their heads , some @entity37 are urging a boycott			1
@entity96 chief rep. @entity95 reportedly told a closed - door @entity98 meeting wednesday morning that his party 's members should sit out the committee completely , turning it into a partisan exercise			1
@entity39 minority leader @entity103 and @entity37 whip @entity104 wrote to speaker @entity105 tuesday night urging him to split the committee down the middle			2
' if you truly want this new select committee to be bipartisan and fair – and to be taken seriously by the @entity58 people – we call on you to reconsider this approach before bringing this measure to the @entity39 floor for a vote , ' they wrote			0
@entity105 responded wednesday by insisting that he would n't let the process devolve into a ' sideshow ' or a ' circus			0
' ' this is all about getting to the truth , ' he told reporters			0
' this is a serious investigation			0
our system of government depends on transparency and accountability			0
' the 2012 @entity4 terror attack cost the lives of four @entity58 including the @entity58 ambassador to @entity59 , and latter - day @entity39 disclosures are only now beginning to provide investigators with a full picture of what happened and how the @entity17 administration reacted no circus , no sideshow : house speaker @entity105 green - lighted a special ' select ' committee with sweeping powers and is insisting on a 7 - 5 @entity1 majority among its members as the marathon @entity146 hearing dragged on into the dinner hour wednesday , @entity1 insisted their majority status in the @entity39 would be mirrored in the new @entity4 committee 's roster			1
@entity153 @entity1 rep. @entity152 noted that @entity154 had launched seven select committees during his lifetime , and ' all have had a slant toward the majority			2
' rep. @entity159 , another @entity1 , fought back @entity37 ' arguments by saying , ' i became speaker of the @entity163 by one vote , but that 's the majority that puts you there			2
' @entity105 green - lighted the select committee following the emergence of documents – 20 months after @entity154 began demanding them – showing that the @entity39 knew almost instantly who was attacking @entity58 diplomats and why			2
president @entity17 , then - @entity35 , then - @entity174 ambassador @entity173 and other administration officials initially argued that the devastation and casualties resulted from a spontaneous protest sparked by a crude anti-islam video produced in @entity180			1
the latest email , sent to @entity183 staffers by deputy national security adviser @entity184 , suggests an organized strategy to deflect criticism in the months preceding @entity187 by intentionally clinging to the false story about the video			0
' the memo , i think , is evidence of a cover - up , ' @entity12 said wednesday morning			2
@entity194 , a former @entity195 official , has testified that he personally edited a set of talking points provided to @entity198 and members of @entity154 in the days after the @entity4 attack , removing references to terrorist groups because he believed that information was considered classified			1
@entity12 also raised the hackles of some @entity1 by upbraiding his own party for turning @entity4 into a fundraising issue			1
the @entity207 launched a fundraising campaign tuesday night asking for money to ' fight liberals ' on @entity4 , and bringing a stern rebuke from select committee chair rep. @entity12 the @entity207 launched a website tuesday night designed to collect funds from outraged conservative ' @entity4 watchdogs ' who have lost patience with what they see as blatant obstructionism and are prepared to donate money			1
' @entity221 will make sure that no one will get away from @entity12 and the @entity223 , ' the online pitch reads			0
' this is going to be a national effort for a national investigation			0
... help fight liberals by donating today			0
' asked wednesday morning if the @entity1 should avoid bulking up its campaign purse from @entity4 - related appeals , he said , " yes , and i will cite myself as an example			1
' ' i have never sought to raise a single penny on the backs of four murdered @entity58 , ' @entity12 insisted			0
democrats , too , have begun to politicize @entity4 in the context of electoral politics			0
@entity239 , a @entity240 running for @entity154 in @entity241 , tweeted wednesday that ' [ t ] he only reason the @entity1 is still harping [ about ] @entity4 is because they fear @entity35 actually has a chance at becoming @entity244			1
' ' as part of @entity252 , ' she tweeted on sunday , ' republicans like screaming the name of their fluffer , @entity4 , when they orgasm			0

@entity146 spent wednesday debating how to constitute the new @entity4 committee , with republicans holding out for a 7 - 5 advantage
chairman @entity12 told @entity14 viewers that he wo n't cut the investigation short if the @entity17 administration ' slow - walks ' cooperation
he also upbraided his own national party for launching a fundraising campaign based on conservative outrage
a long - ranging committee mandate could *hobble* @entity35 , the secretary of state when the attack occurred , if she makes a presidential run
many @entity37 coalesced around a strategy to refuse *participation* if the committee does n't include an equal number of members from both parties
@entity1 in the @entity279 are also *chomping* at the bit , asking for a joint committee that would span both houses of @entity154
