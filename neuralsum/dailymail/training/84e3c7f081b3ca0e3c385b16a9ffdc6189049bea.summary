@entity0 is an overpaid penalty taker who no longer takes penalties			1
@entity4 thinks differently , and he will need more than a massive dose of good luck to come out of this one looking clever			2
the @entity8 boss survived the @entity10 controversies with his reputation not just intact but enhanced			1
however , his faith in @entity0 could soil that managerial cv			1
it seems all the @entity17 forward has to do at the moment is run around and make a few tackles and he gets nine out of 10 from most @entity8 fans			2
@entity0 scores from the penalty spot during the shootout against @entity23 last week @entity8 manager @entity4 ( right ) talks with @entity0 during training at @entity26 last thursday i ’m sure they also love social media videos of him inhaling helium and singing @entity8 songs			1
at least he has n’t bitten anyone			0
those supporters seem grateful to have @entity0 at @entity35 , when in truth , he should be thankful for another chance			2
@entity38 were so desperate to get rid of the striker they accepted only £ 16million for him			1
that desperation became obvious when they replaced him with @entity44			0
@entity8 should n’t be dealing with bargain strikers nobody else wants			2
@entity0 ’s record with managers is n’t great			2
@entity49 did n’t want him , describing him as ' unmanageable '			0
even @entity50 , who admitted that he viewed @entity0 like ' one of his children ' , lost patience and sold him after the pair had a scrap on the training ground following another @entity0 transgression			1
you 've got to respect @entity4 for taking on the challenge , but it ’s another potential problem he faces in a season which already promised to be tough			0
@entity0 ( centre ) is pictured with @entity63 ( left ) and @entity64 on the plane to @entity66 on tuesday @entity0 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) arrive at @entity67 on tuesday morning @entity0 misses a chance on goal during the @entity71 derby between @entity8 and @entity72 on saturday @entity0 was replaced in the second half by @entity74 at @entity35 on saturday on saturday in the derby , @entity0 did n’t impact the game significantly			1
in fact he missed a sitter that would have guaranteed @entity8 three points			0
@entity80 made himself big and made the save , but the keeper should have been given no chance – that ’s what a truly top level striker would have done			0
but that is airbrushed out of the @entity8 fans ’ reports of the game , they prefer instead to focus on how hard he worked			0
is that enough to keep them happy ? this boy in a man ’s body has had so many chances in football that mere hard work should be the bare minimum he owes @entity8 for their lifeline this summer			2
he ’s a lucky fella			0
and what about this so - called hard work being done by @entity0 ? he does a fraction of the work @entity10 used to get through , and obviously his career goal record is vastly inferior			1
@entity0 at the @entity106 in @entity107 at the weekend @entity0 scores the only goal of his @entity8 spell so far against @entity109 in the @entity110 @entity111 striker @entity0 celebrates his first goal for the @entity35 club on september 16 let ’s wait and see what it is that @entity0 brings to the @entity8 party			1
a couple of stuttering shootout spot kicks against @entity23 , and a goal against @entity110 also - rans are a mediocre return so far			1
it ’s early days , but points are being dropped			0
what is even more inexplicable is @entity4 ’ decision to effectively end @entity74 ’s top flight career			0
despite doing well for @entity127 and @entity128 last year , @entity74 has yet to start a @entity130 game for his new club , with @entity0 preferred up front			0
managers who have put their faith in the @entity111 in the past have been let down			2
@entity4 is setting himself up for a fall – he has put an extraordinary amount of faith in this player , and it would be a shame if @entity0 did n’t repay this faith in full			1
but will he ? @entity74 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) take part in a training session at @entity26 last week maybe @entity0 would be wise to reflect on the words of a true @entity8 legend			1
@entity147 said this after @entity0 saw red at @entity35 in 2011 : ' sometimes if you look in the mirror you get the answer			0
' @entity4 can only hope and pray @entity0 has looked in the mirror and asked the right questions			1
if the striker does n’t get it right at @entity35 , the manager will have to provide a few answers			0
like @entity159 's facebook page .			0

@entity8 manager @entity4 ' faith in @entity0 could soil his managerial cv
@entity38 were so desperate to get rid of the striker that they accepted £ 16million for him
@entity49 did *n't* want the @entity111 and @entity50 lost patience and sold him
@entity0 does a fraction of the work @entity10 used to get through
a couple of shootout spot kicks and one goal against @entity110 also - rans is a mediocre return so far
