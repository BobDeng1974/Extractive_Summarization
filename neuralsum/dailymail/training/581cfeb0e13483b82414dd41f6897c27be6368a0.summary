the consultant who treated @entity2 ’s heart ‘ flutter ’ is pioneering a same - day method to detect and treat similar cardiac problems			1
a ‘ heart detective ’ system is being used to root out the cause of disorders that make the heart beat too slowly , too fast or out of sync			1
called the rhythmia mapping system , the technique involves a probe being threaded up into the heart via a small incision in the groin			1
the probe , which looks like a miniature egg whisk , brushes the surface of the heart , with electrodes picking up problem tissue in just 15 minutes			1
this tissue is then burned away under local anaesthetic and normal rhythm is restored , meaning patients may be able to go home the same day			0
consultant cardiologist @entity29 , who treated the former prime minister for an abnormal heart rhythm in 2004 , is one of the first in @entity33 to use the device , caring for patients at @entity37 ’s @entity36			1
it is also being used at the @entity39 in @entity37			0
mr @entity29 says the treatment is a breakthrough for hundreds of thousands of patients suffering from complex rhythm conditions , which can trigger strokes – or even sudden death			2
‘ these abnormal rhythms have a major impact on people ’s lives and survival , ’ he says			2
‘ the advantage of this system is that it “ maps ” the heart ’s electrical activity more accurately and more quickly			2
’ a ‘ normal ’ heart beats between 60 and 100 times a minute when resting			2
but for people with atrial fibrillation ( @entity61 ) – the most common of abnormal heart rhythm conditions – it can beat 140 times a minute			2
consultant cardiologist @entity29 , who is pioneering the method , treated @entity2 ’s ( above ) heart ‘ flutter ’ in 2004 this is because electrical impulses start firing off randomly in the upper chambers of the heart , causing it beat out of rhythm			1
mr @entity2 is one of an estimated 800,000 @entity73 to be diagnosed with the condition , which can cause breathlessness , dizziness and palpitations			0
he underwent a two - and - a - half hour operation , known as a catheter ablation , to correct his irregular heartbeat in october 2004			2
with @entity61 , blood can pool and clots can form inside the heart , which , if left untreated , can make the patient five times more likely to suffer a stroke			0
similarly , actor @entity87 blamed his recent collapse on stage on an irregular heart rhythm condition			0
the 78 - year - old , who underwent a heart procedure three years ago , said he had suffered a ‘ little fibrillation ’ after fainting and falling during a performance of @entity95 ’s @entity94			2
he has since pulled out of further performances due to ongoing problems			0
scare : actor @entity87 blamed his recent collapse on stage on an irregular heart rhythm condition other rhythm conditions the new procedure could help include ventricular tachycardia , a rapid heartbeat caused by a malfunction in one of the heart ’s ventricles			0
serious cases of this can lead to a cardiac arrest , where the heart stops beating , which in turn stops oxygen - rich blood reaching the brain and other vital organs			0
the recognised treatment for heart - rhythm disorders is to burn away the tissue responsible for the problem , yet the challenge for doctors is to identify the exact spot			1
until now , they have used tubes with electrodes on the tips to monitor the signals and track where they are coming from			0
these send back pictures that can be viewed on a computer screen , but the images tend to be flat and difficult to make out			0
hope : consultant cardiologist @entity29 believes the new treatment method is a major breakthrough in comparison , the ‘ heart detective ’ system , which has been a decade in the making , is far more sophisticated			1
after being threaded up through a 2mm incision in the groin , the whisk - shaped probe inflates to the size of a lime once it reaches the surface of the heart , and begins to monitor the electric signals			1
the probe is fitted with dozens of electrodes that capture 20,000 pieces of data in 15 minutes , compared with only 500 in half an hour with a conventional device			1
this data allows doctors to build a detailed @entity158 image of the heart on a computer to identify the precise section of muscle causing the problem			0
the rogue tissue can then be destroyed in a separate procedure immediately after doctors have ‘ mapped ’ the heart and identified the problem area			1
mr @entity29 said that in some cases , patients can be treated under local anaesthetic , meaning that a longer hospital stay is no longer necessary			1
‘ the new technology locates the source of abnormal accelerated heart rhythms , guiding their elimination and then confirming successful treatment , ’ mr @entity29 adds			1
‘ we expect to be able to reduce procedure times significantly and to provide more accurate and detailed information than we could before			0
’ professor @entity182 , associate medical director at the @entity183 , believes the ‘ heart detective ’ shows real promise to speed up diagnosis of problems and treatment times			1
he says : ‘ by allowing the cardiologist to diagnose more quickly and more accurately exactly where to block the source of heart - rhythm disturbance , patients may have better outcomes			0
we look forward to seeing it tested in larger numbers of patients			0

cardiologist @entity29 treated former *pm* for abnormal heartbeat in 2004
he **'s** pioneering ' heart detective ’ system which can find cause of disorders
called rhythmia mapping system , involves probe being threaded into heart
device , which looks like minature egg whisk , brushes the organ **'s** surface
electrodes from detector can pick up any problem tissue in just 15 minutes
