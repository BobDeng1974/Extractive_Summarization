by @entity0 they may be a hallmark of a galaxy far , far away , but sci - fi deflector shields similar to those in the @entity7 films could one day become a reality , according to a scientific paper			1
the technology - which in the blockbusting films protects pilots including @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 from enemy laser fire - is in fact scientifically possible , a theoretical study says			1
indeed the research , published by physicists from the @entity21 , claims that the raw materials already exist to create the shield , fuelled by powerful magnets , which in the films protects ships like the x-wing and @entity29 fighters from powerful laser blasts			1
@entity31 : the the @entity7 films , spacecraft like those pictured are protected by deflector shields			1
a scientific paper has suggested the technology is theoretically possible dogfights : the shields are used by spaceships including @entity41 and @entity29 ( pictured above )			1
physicists from the @entity43 of @entity21 speculated that a shell of superheated plasma could defend from laser fire however - as the study admits - the results would not be precisely as seen on the silver screen , as the shields would make it impossible to see out of the starfighters , and would also make it difficult to fire any weaponry in return			1
in a paper for university publication @entity58 , three fourth - year physics students at @entity21 show that a sufficiently powerful magnet - the likes of which are already used in medical technology - could sustain a shield which could block laser fire			1
the scientists - @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 - also point out that the type of shield they proposed already exists in the upper reaches of the @entity74 's atmosphere			2
their paper proposes that a replica deflector shield could be created by holding a shell of plasma - super-heated particles charged with electricity - in place with a magnetic field			1
calculations in the paper show that a sufficiently dense field to block @entity7 lasers - which are intense blasts of visible light - could be produced by a magnetic field of five @entity87 - a unit of magnetic strength			1
magnets of up to 3 @entity87 are used in @entity92 scanners , and magnets as strong as 60 @entity87 are used for research			2
flying aces : characters including @entity14 , left , and @entity15 , right , both often fly spacecraft in the @entity7 films which benefit from deflector shields - which scientists speculate could be fuelled by magnets which already exist on @entity74 a layer of plasma - which acts as a shield - already exists around the @entity74 , and helps protect the planet from debris and radiation from space			1
long - distance radio operators already use the phenomenon to ' bounce ' radio signals off of the inside of the so - called ' ionosphere ' shield to communicate with devices farther than the horizon			2
the paper does acknowledge that a very large power source would be needed to sustain the shield , which might make it impractical for a small spaceship like an x-wing			2
the temperature of the plasma layer - around @entity124 - could also present problems			2
however , they suggested the lack of visibility could be overcome by using an ultra-violet camera , which would allow pilots to see the outside world using frequencies outside of the range of the shield			0
@entity67 , one of the authors , told science website @entity138 : ' the @entity74 's atmosphere is made up of several distinct layers , one of which is the ionosphere			0
' the ionosphere is a plasma , and extends from roughly 50km above the surface of the @entity74 to the edge of space			0
just like the plasma described in our paper , it reflects certain frequencies of electromagnetic radiation , in this case radio frequencies			2
' and even though the technology may not have great military uses , it could be useful for containing dangerous amounts of energy - for example in nuclear reactions			0
mr @entity67 continued : ' another possible application of this principle may be for trapping radiation inside a shell of plasma rather than excluding it			0
this may be useful for applications that require incredibly high temperature environments , such as experimental fusion reactors			0
' the timely piece of research comes as filming gets underway for the seventh @entity7 film , the cast for which was announced this week			0
on tuesday @entity177 and @entity178 confirmed on the official @entity7 website that girls star @entity180 would take a part in the relaunched film as well as newcomers @entity183 and @entity185			0
@entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 were also listed as cast members			0
it was also confirmed that stars of the original trilogy - @entity193 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 - would also be in the film , which will be directed by @entity201 and released in 2015			0
the movie will hit theatres on december 18 , 2015 .			0

@entity7 films feature deflector shields to protect spaceships from lasers
paper published by @entity21 says shields are possible
students writing in physics *journal* say the theory behind them is sound
@entity218 of super-heated plasma could be fuelled by strong magnets , they say
however - it would be impossible to see through the shield
