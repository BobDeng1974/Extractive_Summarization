@entity1 football has been as much a curse as a blessing for @entity4 this season yet perhaps this deserved if somewhat fortuitous victory will finally nail the theory that @entity9 ’s side are incapable of fighting a battle on two fronts			1
it was by no means the perfect display from the @entity13 — truthfully we ’ve yet to witness that under the @entity15 — yet for the first time in five attempts they at least succeeded in winning a league game immediately following a @entity1 match			0
it would , however , be impossible not to dwell on how different the outcome might have been had @entity24 ’s side maintained a full quota of players for more than 34 minutes			0
@entity27 ( above ) opens the scoring from a free - kick for @entity4 in the first half , his fifth goal in seven @entity33 captain @entity32 conceded the free - kick , and was sent off for the foul as he was last man @entity36 ( left ) scored @entity4 's second as they overtook @entity33 and move to fourth @entity4 : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 67 ) , @entity47 ( @entity48 79 ) , @entity27 , @entity36 ( @entity49 67 ) subs ( not used ) : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 goals : @entity27 35 , @entity56 64 bookings : @entity45 @entity33 : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 ( @entity68 35 ) , @entity69 ( @entity70 70 ) subs ( not used ) : @entity24 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 goals : none attendance : 42,800 @entity32 ’s ordering off for pulling down the again impressive @entity27 looked fully deserved , but it effectively ended the highly impressive challenge from the @entity81 in the opening half - hour			1
to compound the dismissal , not only was the majestic @entity67 immediately withdrawn but @entity27 scored the consequent free - kick with aplomb			1
@entity9 ’s men rarely looked back from that point			0
@entity4 ’s victory not only capped arguably the best week of @entity9 ’s tenure but may also prove to be the day in which his seemingly slavish devotion to a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system ended			1
with @entity94 and @entity95 injured , @entity9 played both @entity27 and @entity36 in a more orthodox 4 - 4 - 2			1
not only did both strikers score , those around them looked far more at ease with the shape			0
in taking his goal tally to five in seven matches , @entity27 is fast becoming the kind of hero @entity4 fans have craved for so long			1
not that the on - loan @entity106 man was of a mood to pat himself on the back too much			2
victory for @entity9 ( above ) and @entity4 means they have overtaken @entity33 and moved into fourth @entity27 ( above ) celebrates with @entity4 fans after putting his side into the lead in the first half ‘ i ’m happy with the team performance but i feel i should have scored at least one more because i hit the post and the keeper made two good saves , ’ said the @entity114			1
‘ you can say i was unlucky but i wanted one more			0
‘ i want to score as many goals as i can			0
i have five in seven and three assists , so i ’m happy with that			0
‘ once they had the player sent off , we knew we would have a lot of the ball			0
‘ i was looking at the goal difference and , if we win our game in hand , we will be top of the league , which i think these fans deserve			2
’ undefeated in five league matches , @entity33 arrived in the @entity136 with the possibility of going joint - top of the table and there was a boldness to them from the outset			0
@entity67 ’s beautifully floated ball over the top seemed to hold up perfectly for @entity146 but he did not appear to have the legs or the stomach for a one - on - one with @entity38			0
as @entity4 struggled to settle , @entity33 pressed them high up the park , forcing three corners before the hosts had one			1
@entity36 celebrates scoring @entity4 's second in the second half , securing the three points when @entity45 was finally tasked with such a delivery , his execution was accurate			1
@entity36 out - jumped @entity32 at the near post but flashed his header into the side - netting			1
it served to awake @entity4 from their slumbers			1
playing on the right of a more orthodox middle four , @entity43 accelerated to the byeline and hung up a cross for @entity47			0
@entity58 in the @entity33 goal was not troubled by the header			2
@entity67 was intent in displaying his full skill set			0
a rasping 30 - yard strike had @entity38 at full stretch but @entity32 ’s folly would render that the @entity173 ’s last meaningful involvement			1
the @entity33 skipper had looked in a foul mood from the outset , nipping away at @entity177 in particular both on and off the ball			0
perhaps as a consequence , his concentration levels were not what they should have been when @entity43 attempted to laser a pass to @entity27			1
caught the wrong side of his man , @entity32 dragged him to the ground on the edge of the box and was already walking by the time @entity190 dipped into his top pocket			1
@entity32 removes his captain 's armband after being shown a first - half re for his last man foul on @entity36 @entity33 manager @entity24 ( above ) will be frustrated that his side were in the game until the red card @entity67 was immediately replaced with @entity68 but the punishment for the visitors would be two-fold			1
@entity27 liked what he saw from the set - piece and went for power as well as placement to rocket the ball around the wall and away from @entity58			1
what a catastrophic 60 seconds for @entity24 ’s men			0
with that , @entity4 were truly up and running			2
@entity27 ’s sublime turn on the edge of the box saw him bullet a shot down @entity58 ’s throat but the keeper parried at the cost of a corner			2
before the break , @entity43 narrowly missed the target with a flashing strike on the turn then @entity47 drilled the ball a foot wide of the same post from 25 yards			0
for the visitors , a second half of playing percentages lay in store			0
a combination of good fortune and @entity4 ’s profligacy kept @entity33 in the hunt			2
@entity27 thumped the upright , then was left cursing @entity58 as he dived to thwart him 30 seconds later			2
@entity43 failed to punish a handling error by the keeper by only finding the side - netting then @entity36 miscued his shot after being teed up by @entity47			2
redemption for the @entity239 was not long in coming , though			0
@entity42 ’s dead - weight ball down the left found @entity47 , whose cross at pace could not have been better with @entity36 applying a sumptuous finish to take the game out of @entity33 ’s grasp .			2

@entity248 striker @entity27 scored his fifth goal in seven games
@entity253 captain @entity32 sent off for last man foul
@entity36 doubled @entity4 's lead , securing the three points
