@entity1 's @entity0 revealed his first @entity3 goal against @entity4 was even more special as his actress wife was in the crowd			1
the @entity8 midfielder joined @entity1 for a then club record Â£ 5.5million fee in august 2012 but was sent out on loan to @entity12 last season where he was influential in helping the @entity12 win their battle for top - flight survival			1
@entity0 returned to south @entity16 last summer and the former @entity18 playmaker has repaid manager @entity20 's faith in him by playing in every @entity22 game as @entity1 have climbed into the top six			1
@entity0 made a heart sign after scoring against @entity4 and dedicated the goal to his wife in the crowd @entity28 could only watch as @entity0 's angled shot nestled into the bottom corner of the net the 25 - year - old scored his first @entity1 goal in a 2 - 1 win at @entity35 on the opening day of the season but he had to wait until tuesday 's 2 - 0 victory over @entity4 to register in front of @entity3 fans who included his wife @entity43			1
@entity0 celebrated his goal by making a heart sign with his hands , and said : ' it was for my wife who was in the crowd			2
' she comes to every game so she 's been waiting a while			0
normally i 'm not a player who scores - it happens once every three months - but it was nice to score in front of her			0
' @entity0 was on the scoresheet for the first time since the win at @entity35 back in august @entity20 said after @entity1 's victory that he had told @entity0 ' it was about time he scored ' - and his late effort was perfectly timed as it finally broke @entity4 's resistance before @entity67 added gloss with a second against his former club			1
but @entity0 said there was no extra pressure on him to score , even if the return of midfield anchorman @entity75 after long - term injury allowed him to play in a more advanced role			2
' he ( @entity77 ) does n't want to put us under pressure to score , he just gives us more encouragement and is patient with us , ' @entity0 said			2
' we have great attacking players in front of me who are always making great chances , so we are not worried about scoring			0
@entity1 boss @entity20 said ' it was about time ' @entity0 was back among the goals ' it happens sometimes in games that you ca n't , but i 've tried to improve myself and i wanted to score more			2
' normally i stay at the back but i got the chance to push on and my first goal in front of the home fans was very meaningful			0
' @entity1 travel to @entity98 next on sunday with @entity100 's side two points better off than the @entity16 club after their 2 - 1 win at @entity104 , and @entity0 said he is expecting a tough physical examination in east @entity106			1
@entity0 says the @entity107 must stand up and be counted when they travel to @entity98 on sunday ' it 's not always easy away from home , especially at @entity98 , ' @entity0 said			1
' we have to be physically ready			0
' i 'm sure we will have chances so we know we have to concentrate on our defensive work and give us possibility to win			0
' i am not sure if we are better than when i first came here but we are getting better results			0
' we are sixth after this amount of games for the first time and all the boys are mentally prepared to achieve			0
