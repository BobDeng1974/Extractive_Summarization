by @entity0 when young people are taken into care , the hope is that they will be protected by the system			2
sadly , we already know there are children who are catastrophically failed by this safety net , ending up in even more toxic situations than the ones they were plucked from			2
for @entity11 , from @entity12 , a life in care was far from a safe haven			1
victim : @entity11 ( not her real name ) , pictured here , is now 42			1
she is sharing the story of how she was raped and groomed into prostitution , in the hope that is will raise awareness when she was sent to a children ’s home , she claims she was routinely abused and raped by a man everyone else trusted - a social worker			1
after years of sexual abuse at the hands of @entity28 [ all names have been changed to protect identities ] , @entity11 eventually turned to prostitution in her late teens			1
now , 20 years on , she has decided to come forward about her past in an honest - and at times distressing - memoir , in the hope of raising awareness about child grooming			1
‘ i started a diary about what happened a couple of years ago , and that eventually turned into the book , ’ @entity11 tells @entity38			1
‘ leading a quiet life would be far less painful but i feel compelled to talk about this			2
it ’s still very hard for me because it is still very much on the surface			2
‘ but i want to lift the lid about child grooming and the abuse i suffered in the children ’s home			1
' @entity11 grew up on a tough council estate in @entity12 , where she says she was victimised by other girls			1
by the time she was 14 , her mother had suffered several mental episodes ( she was later diagnosed with schizophrenia ) and was unable to look after her , so @entity11 was sent to a children ’s home			1
@entity58 abduction the home was meant to be a safe place for the young girl			2
and at first it was			2
but then a social worker in his 30s began plying her with gifts and showering her with attention , gaining @entity11 ’s trust , a tactic she now refers to as ‘ slow - burning grooming			1
’ within months @entity11 had formed a strong attachment to @entity28 and consented to having sex with him			1
at the time , she saw nothing wrong with their 20 - year age gap and the fact she was just 14			1
‘ @entity28 and the other social workers worked in shifts , often staying the night , ’ @entity11 explains			1
‘ i do n’t think anyone had any idea what was going on			2
i did n’t tell them because i was ashamed and i did n’t think i ’d be believed anyway			2
i do n’t think they had any inkling at all			2
’ courage : @entity11 says talking about her horrific past is difficult , but if she can help just one girl who is being abused , then it will make her happy @entity11 says their sexual relationship continued for years			1
they would have sex in @entity28 ’s office , his home , in public toilets and at the children ’s home			2
all the while , @entity28 gave @entity102 presents and cash in return for her body			2
@entity11 was re-housed and given her own council flat at the age of 18			1
she went to art college , but by this point , she had already begun prostituting herself			2
she describes in the book how sex for money felt normal for her , even though she knew on some level that it was very wrong			1
‘ i was so ashamed so never told anyone or made friends , ’ she says			2
‘ i ’ve been ashamed all my life			2
it ’s only very recently i ’ve been able to talk about it			0
’ however , by the time she was ‘ 19 or 20 , ' @entity11 started to realise that the life she was living was far from normal			1
‘ i was having very dysfunctional relationships , i was promiscuous , ’ she says			0
‘ i realised my problem was @entity28			0
and i realised it was wrong			0
‘ when you ’re an adult you realise that is n’t right			0
i was older and wiser			0
one day , when i was around 19 or 20 , i found the courage to go into the police and tell them about it but it took a long time to get to that stage			0
’ raw is out now , £ 6.99 by @entity136 she made her complaint in 1990 , when she was and the process dragged on for ' around ' three years , according to @entity11 , who has difficulty remembering specific dates			1
@entity11 eventually decided to withdraw her complaint in 1993 as reliving her past proved too painful			1
‘ it ’s very hard to sit there and relive your experiences to a complete stranger , ’ she says			0
‘ you have to remember the day , the week , the weather			0
it ’s so difficult and you can see why often court cases collapse			0
' you see why the victim is so frustrated			0
it ’s like being abused all over again			1
people who come forward now are very brave			0
@entity11 's allegations against @entity28 were never heard in court , and he was never convicted			1
at around that time , she was moving in moneyed circles in @entity157 and @entity158 , still a prostitute and taking drugs and drinking heavily			1
it was n't until she met @entity162 , now her husband , in 2001 , that she was able to break her unhealthy patterns of behaviour			0
she credits @entity162 for helping her rebuild her life			0
‘ when i told him about my past he was very understanding , ’ she says			0
‘ he ’s very strong and grounded			0
‘ he says he loves me for what i am , tells me that my past is n’t my fault and he gives me a lot of strength			0
‘ if i saw @entity28 now i ’d think he was a sad old man			0
i see him as weak			0
i have the strength and power now and i would n’t be afraid of him , i do n’t live in fear anymore because i think he ’s pathetic			0
‘ it took time to build my life up			0
it ’s like an invisible tattoo or a scar – it never heals			0
my life now is happy			0
i ’m in a very good place			0
i have a loving family and a network of supportive , understanding friends			0
’ @entity11 married @entity162 in 2002 , and their first child , a daughter , was born the same year			1
in 2005 , they had a son and , in 2007 , left @entity12 for the west of @entity190 , where the family still lives			0
now @entity11 wants to share her story so she can help other girls who are being abused and groomed			1
‘ i want to shout from the rooftops how terrible grooming is and how damaging it can be , ’ she says			1
‘ it ’s calculated and slow - burning and evil and it can muck up your whole life if you let it			0
if there is just one 14 - year - old out there that i can help , i will be happy			1
‘ being abused never goes away , you just find a way to cope with it , ’ she says			1
‘ it ’s always there , but i wo n’t let him win			0
