there was poetic symmetry in @entity3 's humbling of @entity4 at @entity5 on monday night			1
ten years ago this month , the @entity7 striker humiliated another of the world 's best defenders , @entity12 and @entity13 winner @entity11			0
sure , @entity11 was just 18 at the time and playing for @entity16 's reserves but he , like @entity4 , is all too aware of @entity3 's talents after the @entity18 scored a hat - trick against him in @entity21 colours			2
@entity3 jumps for joy after putting @entity7 1 - 0 up against @entity23 on monday night @entity24 and @entity25 defender @entity11 once conceded three against @entity3 in a reserve match in 2005 their careers have taken wholly different paths in the last decade but after a man - of - the - match display which all but ended the @entity32 champions ' title defence in a match viewed by millions around the world , @entity3 now gets a little taste of the limelight that @entity11 has basked in at @entity24 for years			1
his poachers ' effort on monday was his fifth goal in his last five games			2
@entity3 now boasts the fifth - best goals - per - minute ratio in @entity44 's top five leagues			1
he may lack pace but @entity3 's speed of thought is rapid and you will struggle to find a frontman in the land with a better ability to win the ball in the air , bring others in to play and generally unsettle defenders			0
just look at how troubled the vastly experienced and physically powerfully @entity23 pair of @entity4 and @entity57 were on monday night			1
much of @entity3 's success comes from his cunning , a nous to win duels and subtly influence referees no doubt enhanced by years playing at the lower levels			0
@entity3 holds off a challenge from @entity23 captain @entity4 @entity4 looks inconsolable at the end of the game after @entity23 were beaten 2 - 1 and we 're not just talking @entity68 and two here , where @entity3 first began to shine with @entity70 and @entity71			1
before then he had turned out in non-league for @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity21 and even had a spell at @entity76 in @entity78 ’s third tier			0
footballers just do n't take that sort of path to the top anymore , but there is no doubt @entity3 , now 31 , deserves his chance			0
his telepathic understanding with flying wingers @entity88 and @entity89 brought him 30 goals in 2012 - 13 and with it @entity7 's promotion			2
cruelly , he ruptured his cruciate knee ligament in the play - off semi-final victory over @entity71 that year and missed the majority of last season recovering			0
he had notched up 14 appearances by the end of the campaign , mostly off the bench , but looked a shadow of his former self under @entity103 , with the exception of a typically bullying display in @entity107 's famous implosion at @entity5 last may			0
@entity3 celebrates scoring at @entity108 as @entity7 beat @entity16 in december 2011 @entity3 scores against @entity23 for @entity71 in the @entity109 back in september 2008 despite his rugged style @entity3 , like most players , needs a proverbial arm around the shoulder to produce his best - something @entity115 has undoubtedly afforded him and that @entity116 before him emphatically failed to do			1
@entity115 's predecessor shipped @entity3 out on loan to @entity119 to make room in his squad for @entity122 , a striker who had scored just three goals in 23 games in @entity125 for @entity126 the season before			2
how foolish that move looks now			0
@entity115 , in contrast , immediately reinstalled @entity3 in the @entity7 side and gave him a new contract to the end of next season when he took over in january			2
his faith has been rewarded with a rich vein of goalscoring form that gives @entity3 the best goals - per - minute ratio of anyone in the @entity32			1
@entity3 wheels away to celebrate as @entity23 's defenders appeal in vain for offside the @entity18 striker signed a new contract for @entity7 back in january only four players in @entity44 have a better ratio than @entity3 – though he has some way to go to catch @entity148 and @entity149			1
one thing is for sure though , @entity4 will certainly be glad to see the back of him , as was @entity11 10 years ago .			0

@entity7 beat @entity23 2 - 1 at @entity5 on monday night
@entity3 *netted* his fifth goal in five games to open the scoring
@entity3 now has best goals - per - minute ratio of anyone in @entity32
