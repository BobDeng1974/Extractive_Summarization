and now @entity14 are into the draw			2
@entity9 or @entity15 left , and it 's the latter			1
@entity0 ! @entity1 ! they wo n't fancy that trip whatsoever ! @entity47 out of the hat , with some big names left ... and it 's @entity51 's @entity50 , who won the competition at the @entity54 in 2008			1

we 're sitting through a lovely montage of goals and action from the group stage , but i 'd rather they got on with it			0
right , @entity102 's spiel has begun ! ' may i extend my congratulations to all of the clubs who have made it to the round of 32 , ' he says			2
bet they 're well chuffed with that			0
it 'll be interesting to see how our clubs treat this competition from now on			0
with the exception of @entity14 , they 've struggled domestically and may see this as their real chance of a bit of silverware			0
but , in the midst of a @entity92 season , it 's easy to just dismiss a thursday night			0

it went rather well for the @entity144 clubs , on the whole			0

all roads lead to @entity152			0
all joking aside , @entity0 are the big draw when we kick off at noon , but there are a number of banana skins among this lot : @entity95 , @entity159 , @entity1 , @entity62 , @entity160 , @entity9 , @entity57 , @entity69 , @entity161 , @entity15 , @entity33 , @entity71 , @entity89 , @entity30 , @entity50			1
