victim : @entity23 , a baby born without arms after her mother took the morning sickness drug in 1963 @entity27 , head consultant of the @entity28 @entity17 , said @entity29 needed to ' put their money where their mouth is ' rather than simply express regret			1
mr @entity27 , who was born in @entity35 in 1959 with no arms and no legs after his mother took the drug , said : ' it 's a disgrace that it 's taken them 50 years to apologise			1

he said : ' being disabled is very expensive and @entity95 people need help and care , and adaptations to their cars and homes			0
" so we welcome the apology , but how far do they want to go ? it 's no good apologising if they wo n't open discussions on compensation			2
they 've got to seriously consider financial compensation for these people			0
' we just want people to live a comfortable life and that means @entity29 have to pay for their mistake financially			0

shock is having your precious child born without arms and legs			1
