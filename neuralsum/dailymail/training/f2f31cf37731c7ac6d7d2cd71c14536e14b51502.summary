@entity16 the pelican was abandoned by his flock after a storm hit @entity21 in @entity22			1
the three - month old bird washed up in @entity24 , injured and unable to feed himself			1
in flight , the pelican is an elegant soaring bird			2
males are larger than females , and have a long beak that grows in a downwards arc , as opposed to the shorter , straighter beak of the female			0
male pelicans typically weigh between 12kgs and 15kgs and have a wingspan of around 3.6metres – the second largest of any bird			2
as staff helped the ruffled animal recover , they realised @entity16 might not have learned to fly and set about trying to teach him by running up and down the beach with him , flapping their arms to encourage the bird to flap his wings			1
‘ he did n't fly for some weeks but with encouragement he got the idea			0
we are n't sure how much flying he may have already done before arriving here but he was pretty shaky in his next attempts on the beach , ’ staff wrote on @entity65 's blog			0
‘ we would run up and down flapping our arms and simulating flight for him			2
he would look on curiously until one day he showed us how it was done ! ’ as staff helped the ruffled animal recover , they realised @entity16 might not have learned to fly and set about trying to teach him by running up and down the beach with him , flapping their arms ( pictured ) to encourage the bird to flap his wings to capture the moment when @entity16 first took to the air with ease , the staff attached a small @entity88 camera to its beak ( just visible ) to capture the moment when @entity16 first took to the air with ease , the staff attached a small @entity88 camera to its beak so that the pelican could effectively film himself in flight			1
‘ we are so proud of him and he is such a clever bird			0
he can fly ! ’ they said			0
the bird ’s first attempts at flying were ‘ short and uncontrolled and we would look away when he was landing as he seemed to not distinguish between ground and air speed coming in way too fast and endangering our beach furniture , ’ the said			2
staff at @entity24 said that @entity16 's first attempts at flying were ' short and uncontrolled and we would look away when he was landing as he seemed to not distinguish between ground and air speed coming in way too fast and endangering our beach furniture			1
' here the bird is filmed taking off all the lessons paid off : @entity16 the orphaned pelican films himself flying over a lake in @entity22 trying to teach the animal the life skills to survive , park workers also had to feed the pelican , which could n’t fish without his flock and simply waddled up the beach for help and food five months ago			1
the birds do not dive for fish , but instead corral fish by working together as a flock , before scooping the trapped fish into their large stretchy pouches beneath their beaks			0
it is thought that @entity16 was separated from his flock after he was sucked into a large cumulonimbus storm cell - vertical clouds producing thunder and torrential rain - and thrown off course on the lake			1
@entity16 the pelican was abandoned by his flock after a storm hit @entity21 in @entity22 , pictured and was looked after by staff at @entity24 park , also marked on the map it is thought that @entity16 ( pictured ) was separated from his flock he was sucked into a large cumulonimbus storm cell - vertical clouds producing thunder and torrential rain - and relocated on the lake experts said the nearest flock of great white pelicans , to which @entity16 might have belonged , is in @entity151 around 93miles ( 150kms ) away from the lakeside park			1
after spending so much time with the bird , the experts worked out he is male because of the size and shape of his bill and his pink facial mask			0
‘ he was all brown when he arrived but the colours are really coming through now and his pouch , legs and face are changing to bright yellow and pink , the colour of the mature birds , ’ the workers said			0
