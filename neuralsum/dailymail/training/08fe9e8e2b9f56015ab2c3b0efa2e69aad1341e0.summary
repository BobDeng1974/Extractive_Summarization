by @entity0 last updated at 8:50 pm on 24th june 2011 @entity1 has had his £ 15million @entity3 villa seized by the @entity5 authorities over an unpaid wage bill of £ 246,000 to his gardener			1
a @entity5 court ordered the sequestration of the @entity12 tennis ace 's 700,000 sq ft ranch - style house and grounds called @entity15 until the bill is paid to the groundsman			1
it is the latest in a long string of financial headaches that the luxurious villa has caused the triple @entity23 winner over the last 14 years			1
he has been unsuccessfully trying to sell the villa since 2007 , which is why he has had to pay such an enormous upkeep on the massive grounds that comes to exactly £ 246,225.46 to keep it in pristine condition for potential buyers			1
house of horrors : @entity1 's @entity36 villa in @entity3 has caused him a lot of strife groundsmen grief : the dispute has spiralled from an unpaid wage @entity1 's lawyer argued before a court on the island that the sum can only be paid by his client when the property is sold by celebrity @entity12 realtor @entity48			2
@entity48 said he is not responsible for settling @entity1 's gardening debts before it is sold			2
meant for a family : @entity1 and his wife @entity53 now live in @entity54 and want to sell the house he bought with former wife @entity56 @entity1 tried to play down the severity of the punishment , telling @entity12 newspaper @entity59 : ' it 's not so dramatic			1
but if someone believes they have suffered an injustice it is up to him to seek redress			2
' the procedure is ongoing so i can say no more			2
' the father - of - four bought the villa with his former wife @entity56 in 1997			1
he was fined close to £ 190,000 by a court in 2004 for unauthorised changes to it during construction			2
despite the fine he took pleasure in his achievements at the site , which boasts a massive garden with orange trees , a guest house , pool , tennis and basketball courts and spreads out over 75 acres			0
' i come from a family of architects and interior designers			0
i was on a building site before i was playing tennis			0
so i was very much involved , ' he said			0
when the tennis star , who won @entity23 for the first time aged 17 , initially put it on the market he explained that the home was meant to be used by a big family			1
' the whole idea was a family house , but now , my two boys are in @entity100 and my daughter is in @entity102 , so that ’s two or three weeks a year here , and that ’s it , ' he said			0
still up for sale : the @entity23 ace has been trying to sell his luxurious pad for years selling up : the luxurious kitchen and the rest of the huge property is on the market his ex-wife @entity56 took a massive £ 10million , plus a £ 1.8million pound house in @entity116 , from him in a divorce settlement following his 1999 fling in a cleaning cupboard at the posh @entity102 restaurant @entity121 with @entity122 emigre @entity1			1
that led to the birth of daughter @entity125 , the purchase of a £ 1million flat for her and her mother in @entity102 plus maintenance payments			0
but there is more bad news in store for @entity1 with the villa @entity12 newspapers dub the ' house of horrors			0
' a builder is claiming £ 500,000 from him for unpaid work and a court case is underway			0
@entity1 , who just narrowly escaped a jail sentence a few years ago on tax evasion charges , now lives in @entity54 after marrying his partner @entity141			0
but the red - headed prodigy will have to forget his villa woes , as is currently in @entity23 commentating on the championship			1
trying to get rid of the ranch : @entity1 says the villa is more suited to a family , rather than an occasional holiday getaway			0

@entity23 winner has been trying - unsuccessfully - to sell it since 2007
