by @entity0 published : 12:30 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 14:10 est , 22 january 2014 with an average cost of Â £ 5,000 for a breast implant operation in @entity5 , it 's perhaps unsurprising that 43 per cent of people say they would travel abroad to have cosmetic surgery			2
but the risks associated with surgery abroad can be huge , as @entity10 , a 29 - year - old beauty therapist from @entity11 , discovered			1
hoping to get a bargain boob job , she travelled to @entity13 in the @entity14 in 2009 but was left implants that became so badly infected that part of her own breast tissue was eaten away			1
agony : @entity10 , 29 , from @entity11 , was left in excruciating pain after a budget boob job went wrong ' flying to @entity13 , i was very confident and happy about the surgery i was going to have , ' she explains			1
but her confidence did n't last long			2
on arriving at the clinic , she found that the surgeon could barely speak @entity27 and offered only a minimal consultation			2
' he just said , " what size would you like to go ? " , and i said a couple of sizes bigger and i 'd like an uplift			0
so he drew the lines and said , " see you in an hour "			0
' i did have doubts but i just wanted nice breasts and i thought it would all be fine			0
' but when ms @entity10 woke up from the operation , she found herself in excruciating pain			1
nevertheless , a few days after surgery , she flew home - without raising the issue with her surgeon			0
' i definitely felt something was n't right when i got on the plane , ' she adds			0
by the time she reached home , the pain had become extreme and disaster was about to strike			0
falling out : according to @entity10 's mother @entity51 , it appeared as if the infected implants were falling out operation : since the botched boob job , @entity10 has had to have six different operations to repair her bust ' i got them out [ to show friends and family ] and they all were saying , " oh wow , they 're so nice " and then suddenly , this stuff started leaking out of my left boob			1
' ' she pulled her top up and i 'm not a surgeon , but i 'm 99 per cent sure the implants were falling out , ' adds ms @entity10 's mother , @entity68			1
' they were green , awful , heartbreaking			0
i 'd never seen anything so ugly			0
' horrified , mrs @entity68 rushed her daughter straight to hospital where she saw a plastic surgeon who immediately decided to remove the implants			1
with infections raging through both breasts , it took another four operations before her breasts began to heal and another two months before the wounds sealed up			2
' the surgeon said , " you could have died if you 'd just ignored it , " ' adds ms @entity10			1
' [ @entity86 ] , my boobs looked ugly and i just thought my whole body looked ugly ... i hated it			0
' beautiful : @entity14 capital @entity13 is the perfect spot for a holiday but apparently not for boob jobs ' the moral of this story , really , is that i would caution people about going abroad to have boob jobs , ' comments leading plastic and reconstructive surgeon , dr @entity94			1
' most people who go abroad know nothing about the person doing the operation and that 's very dangerous			0
so you might be saving money but you might have to spend a lot more in the long run			0
' for ms @entity10 , the consequences of her budget boob job included uneven breasts , with the left smaller than the right after the infection ate away her breast tissue			1
the bungled operation also left her Â £ 4,000 out - of - pocket and facing the prospect of another two operations , one to even up her breasts and another to reduce the scarring			2
four years on and several operations later , ms @entity10 is almost healed and insists she wo n't make the same mistake again			1
with one last operation to go , she adds : ' this is the last bit now ... it 's just been a roller coaster ! ' one that she , happily , will soon be able to get off			0
@entity10 appears on @entity130 , tomorrow night at 10pm on @entity131			2

@entity10 , 29 , from @entity11 , had a boob job in @entity13 in 2009
after returning , the implants became infected and she was rushed to @entity136
infection was so severe , she almost died and needed six further operations
