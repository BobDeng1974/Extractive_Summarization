' that 's when we realised it was on fire and saw it as a great photo opportunity - it 's not exactly something you see every day			1
' the photograph was posted onto @entity55 , an image sharing website , where in five days it has attracted nearly 1.3million views and hundreds of - mostly admiring - comments			2
