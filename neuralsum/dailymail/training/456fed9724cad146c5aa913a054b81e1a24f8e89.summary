by @entity1 reporter published : 09:33 est , 6 july 2013 updated : 13:22 est , 6 july 2013 it is the high octane , adrenaline - fuelled extravaganza that injures - and sometimes kills - hundreds of of people a year and has been branded cruel by animal welfare groups			1
but in extraordinary scenes today , the annual bull - running festival of @entity9 - made famous by @entity11 's novel , @entity8 - showed it has lost none of its lure , as thousands of people packed the streets of @entity18 to mark the start of nine days of blood and gore			1
bedecked in white and holding the traditional vivid red scarves , a writhing mass of humanity basked in blazing temperatures as they prepared for the traditional launch of a firework that signals the release of the bulls			2
sea of humanity : the square in @entity18 is packed with thousands of people ahead of the start of the nine - day bull - running festival of @entity9 riot of colour : a glorious sea of red means it only one thing in pamplona - bulls defiant : concerns over animal welfare were ignored by the throng of people who flock to @entity49 city every year for perhaps the most famous festival in @entity51 packed in tight : revelers kick off the event with a party ahead of the launching of a rocket to mark the release of the bulls @entity59 : several thousand people hold up the traditional red scarf as they celebrate the beginning of the festival @entity64 : passions run high for one couple , right , while a group of men get into the spirit of things , right the party was delayed briefly after suspected nationalists draped the @entity49 flag over the city hall			1
six 100 - stone bulls and six steers from are set free from their corral and a crowd of revellers will then run for nearly a kilometre through the city , ending up at the bullring			1
there are absolutely no hiding places			0
workers erect 12 - feet barriers along the route , and many participants push their luck too far			0
around 200 are injured during @entity9 each year , and the bull runs have claimed 15 lives since 1924 , with the most recent death , that of a 62 - year - old @entity92 , occurring in 2003			1
surfing : a girl rides the crowd , as the party atmosphere reaches fever pitch thirsty work : a reveler drinks wine at the start of a festival that injures on average about 200 people a year celebration : a group of men hoist a woman in the air during the ' @entity110 ' marking the start of the @entity9 tradition : revellers gathered in @entity115 square , in @entity18 , to mark the start of the famous festival @entity117 and white : people gathered in the square are covered in red paint and consume red drinks party : a man is held aloft above the crowd , where everyone has come dressed in white the issue of animal rights has long gone hand - in - hand with @entity9			1
the bulls that take part in the run each morning are killed by bullfighters in the evening , usually in a slow and torturous manner			2
ahead of this year ’s edition , one of its most high profile opponents has been @entity138 , the writer and poet			2
writing for the @entity141 ’s comment is free section , he argued all visitors to the festival have ' blood on their hands '			2
euphoria : animal rights groups have denounced the festival as cruel but it remains as popular as ever @entity150 : festival - goers cool off in @entity115 square glorified : @entity11 featured the festival in his 1926 novel @entity8 leap of faith : a reveller jumps from a fountain at the @entity158 as he is sprayed with water during the start of the @entity9 festival regional pride : proceedings were delayed when a @entity49 flag that was planted on the town hall was removed colourful : @entity18 was turned into a sea of red , as hundreds of tourists joined locals to celebrate the festival made famous by @entity11 full to capacity : every vantage point was taken as crowds flocked to get a look in on festivities having a ball : these people have ' blood on their hands ' according to @entity181 , who says the suffering experienced by bulls at the festival is cruel ' tourists who participate in the run or visit @entity18 simply to watch it contribute to the carnage , ' he said			1
' every shared tapa , every cerveza , every booked hotel room and balcony bolsters the killing			0
as long as the city makes money off the event , bulls will continue to suffer and die			0
' ' tormenting and butchering bulls for entertainment belongs to the dark ages – not the 21st century			0
' the @entity200 , a charity , blamed ' lads magazines ' for ' sensationalising the event ... playing up the braveness ' of the human participants , and glossing over ' the reality as to how the bull run ends '			0
but there are signs @entity51 's treatment of the animals could be changing after @entity211 became the second @entity51 region to ban bullfighting , following the @entity214			0
carnage : expect more scenes like this from 2007 when the bulls are released			0
