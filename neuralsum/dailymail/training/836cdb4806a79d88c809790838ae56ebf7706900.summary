by @entity0 published : 08:52 est , 23 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:08 est , 23 february 2014 @entity3 has unveiled its latest smartwatch which will double up as a tv remote and a fitness tracker as it tries to overcome the problems which plagued its first offering			1
the @entity11 , and sister device the @entity12 , will let users track their heart rate while exercising , offer fitness coaching and allow people to design their own workout routines			0
a built in @entity18 will also let people control other electrical devices , such as their tv			2
the @entity11 ( right two watches ) and @entity12 ( left three watches ) feature a camera built into the watch face , as well as a fitness tracker and led which allows them to be used as a remote control design : the new @entity11 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) come in a range of colours and feature a customisable clock face			1
the @entity12 has a slightly bigger display and is also lighter @entity33 , vice president of @entity3 @entity34 & @entity35 , said : ' @entity3 continues to lead in the wearable technology market with innovative , creative devices that are completely integrated into the lives of our customers			2
' offering extended connectivity features , stylish customisation options and a robust application network , we have enhanced everything that people love about the original @entity11 to create a second generation of wearable devices that offer unparalleled smart freedom			0
' the new watch is the latest attempt by a technology firm to tempt buyers into the wearable tech market , which has yet to take off			0
@entity3 's first smartwatch , the @entity56 , proved unpopular with customers because of its poor battery life , clunky camera , and limited range of apps users were also critical of the fact that , without a constant connection to your phone , the @entity11 does n't work sales of @entity3 's first attempt , the @entity56 , have been disappointing due in part to its poor battery life , clunky camera built into the strap and limited selection of apps			1
on the new gear the camera has been moved on to the watch face , but it is unclear what customers will make of other improvements and additional features , such as a range of colours and customisable clock faces			0
other companies , such as @entity86 , have managed to garner more critical success with their offerings , but that has n't translated into large sales figures			0
this latest fan mock - up of the @entity92 appeared online as user speculate about the device			0
@entity95 has had issues developing the watch meaning the release date has been pushed back tech geeks have been creating mock - up ads as they await a release date			1
@entity95 reportedly had problems making some components and had to bring in outside help @entity105 has just launched its new watch , the @entity107 2 , which is less expensive and has longer battery life @entity95 has reportedly run into number of problems developing its own ' @entity111 ' , including difficulties making components , and has been forced to draft in outside help			1
the watch is said to have a 1.5inch screen and use @entity116 to communicate with other devices , and may also feature @entity119 voice controls that let users dictate messages , rather than use the tiny screen			0
the watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video , on the phone or tablet			1
part of the problem with wearable technology is the cost of shrinking the computer parts , with @entity134 costing $ 1,500 ( £ 900 ) @entity105 has also just released its new smartwatch , and @entity136 are due to start shipping their offering in march , though that date could be pushed back			2
users have remained wary due to the high cost involved with shrinking the technology down , with @entity3 's first gear costing £ 300			0
other wearable tech products have similar shortcomings , with @entity134 , high - tech glasses with a built - in computer , costing $ 1,500 ( £ 900 ) .			1
