since 1978 , millions of tiny plastic people have been populating the @entity1			0
and now it is predicted that there could be a miniature @entity5 figure for every person on @entity1 in 2019			0
according to a mathematical online comic , @entity5 has been making its little people at such a rate that they will outnumber the human population by the end of the decade			2
a physics graduate from @entity14 , who is behind the web comic @entity15 has calculated that the predictions for the global population and predictions for the number of @entity21 will match up in 2019 and the little plastic people will go on to out - number humans the first @entity5 figurine went on sale in 1978 and since then , billions have been produced at the end of 2006 , the company announced there were four billion miniature figures in existence , being played with by children across the planet			1
now , a physics graduate from @entity14 , who is behind the web comic @entity15 has calculated that the predictions for the global population and predictions for the number of @entity21 will match up in 2019 and the plastic people will go on to out - number humans			1
if the predictions are correct , there will be almost eight billion people and the same amount of @entity5 figures calling @entity1 home in 2019			1
@entity5 said in 2008 that it has made 400 billion @entity5 bricks since the company began , which is enough for 62 each for every person in existence at that time			2
according to a mathematical online comic , @entity5 has been making its little people at such a rate that they will outnumber the human population by the end of the decade			2
here , s model maker at @entity58 puts the finishing touches to a wall made up of over 6,000 @entity5 figures the first @entity5 figurine went on sale in 1978 and since then , billions have been produced , making them the world 's biggest population group , according to the company			1
the mini figure has been modelled after celebrities from @entity70 to @entity71 and enjoyed various careers , including astronaut , policeman , racing driver , warrior , pirate , skater and scientist as well as taken on the role of fictional characters like @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
@entity5 said that when the mini figure first appeared , it was decided that its face should have only one colour - yellow - and that its facial features should be happy and neutral			0
however earlier this year , robot experts at the @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93 , studied all 6000 minifigures from 1975 to 2010 and found that from the early nineties onwards , @entity5 's mini-figures ' facials expressions have been diversifying from consistently happy smiles to expressions reflecting greater conflict			0
the first figures had no sex , race or specific role , as these would be determined by a child 's imagination and it was not until the launch of @entity109 in the 1980s that the figures were given differing facial expressions			1
in 2003 , with the launch of @entity114 , it was decided that the little characters should finally have authentic skin colours as well as resembling characters as closely as possible - as was seen in the @entity83 sets .			0

a graph produced by a physics graduate in @entity121 , compared human population predictions and the forecast production of @entity5 figures
at the end of 2006 , @entity5 said there were four billion figures in existence , but the number is *expected* to rise to almost eight billion in 2019
the first @entity5 figurine went on sale in 1978 and had no race , sex or specific role , as these would be determined by a child 's imagination
