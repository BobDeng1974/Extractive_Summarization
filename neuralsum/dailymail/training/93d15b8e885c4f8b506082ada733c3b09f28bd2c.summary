by @entity0 published : 04:43 est , 2 may 2012 updated : 11:06 est , 2 may 2012 a four - year - old girl was turned down for a place at her local primary school because she lived just one foot outside the catchment area , her outraged mother has claimed			1
@entity7 had applied for a school less than half a mile from her @entity10 home , but was instead offered a place at a primary more than four times as far away			1
worse , her first choice - @entity13 and @entity14 in @entity15 - was rated as outstanding by @entity16 , while @entity17 in @entity18 is in special measures			1
step too far : @entity7 , pictured with her mother @entity20 and brother @entity21 , 2 , was crushed when she was offered a place at a very different school @entity7 's mother @entity20 , 41 , said the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) ruled that the family 's home was 2,277 feet from their first choice school			1
the last place allocated was to a child who lived 2,276ft away - meaning @entity7 lost out by just a foot			1
mrs @entity7 said : ' when i worked out it was 35cm ( 1ft ) , i thought it was ridiculous , a silly position to be put in over something so small			1
' thirty - five centimetres put me out of the bracket of my first choice school and into @entity39			2
' mrs @entity7 said she was also turned down for two other closer schools - @entity40 and @entity42 - which are less than a mile from her home			1
' we feel sad , failed , exasperated , ' she added			0
' i feel like i ’m being punished for making the wrong choice			0
' ' when i rang the @entity25 they told me that i had picked schools which were oversubscribed			2
long journey : mrs @entity7 said her daughter was also turned down for two other schools that are less than a mile from her home ' for the last five years , if you lived one kilometre away you would have gotten in			1
it ’s not unreasonable to put these choices in			0
' mrs @entity7 plans to fight the decision and has joined forces with other mums who did not get their first - , second - or even third - choice schools in @entity15			1
@entity60 , four , was also given a place at @entity17 after her three choices - including @entity13 - were rejected			2
her mother @entity63 , 33 , said : ' my house is 807m ( 0.5 miles ) from @entity13			0
i went to the open day and we preferred @entity13 over the other schools as it suited my daughter ’s personality			0
' last monday , we got @entity17 and it ’s 2.2 miles door - to - door			0
it ’s really angered us			0
' the mothers have now launched a @entity73 support group called @entity74 and will be holding a meeting at @entity76 from 7.30pm on may 10			0
speaking out : mothers @entity77 and @entity79 have formed a group to campaign against what they view as unfair decisions on school places disappointment : @entity7 was refused a place at @entity13 and @entity14 , pictured , and offered one at a special measures school four times as far away no choice : kings rise @entity17 in @entity18 is more than two miles from @entity7 's home @entity91 said there was not a ' catchment area ' and emphasised that decisions were based on a number of criteria , of which distance from a school is just one			1
a spokesman said : ' we know that school preference places are an important decision for parents / carers			0
the school admissions team processed over 15,000 applications which were carried out on an equal and fair basis , and we always advise parents to be realistic about their preferences			0
' this year , 95 per cent got one of their preferences , and 85 per cent got their first preference			0
' any parent / carer who is unhappy with the place offered may submit an appeal for a place at a preferred school , provided that they included that school as one of their preferences			2
' staff in the school admissions team can offer advice to parents on why their child did not meet the admission criteria for their preferred school and the appeals process			2

@entity7 missed out while child living just a foot closer to the school in @entity15 was accepted
given a place at a school four times as far away and in special measures
she was also turned down for two other closer schools
