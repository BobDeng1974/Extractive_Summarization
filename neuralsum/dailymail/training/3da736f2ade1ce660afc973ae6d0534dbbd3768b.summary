what do @entity0 and the can - can girls at the @entity2 have in common ? they all get their dancing shoes from @entity6 , the @entity8 bootmaker that has cornered the market for top end , made - to - measure footwear for screen and stage			1
founded in 1945 , the @entity6 still operates from the shop where it all began - a small building at 17 @entity16 , just 650ft from the @entity2 itself			1
despite its theatrical clientele , the atelier began life as a simple shoe shop , with founder @entity22 creating bespoke footwear on demand for private clients			1
ready for action : a dancer from the @entity2 shows off her calf - length @entity29 boots while stretching ahead of a performance looking good : a pair of dancers show off their custom - made pink boots created by @entity29 , which come complete with elaborate silver leatherwork ready to dance : a dancer from the @entity2 adjusts the ankle strap on her delicate gold heels and right , a dancer uses the wall as a leg stretching aid by the 1960s , @entity29 had branched out into creating shoes for the theatrical world and today , theatre , cinema and even circuses account for 80 percent of the 400 pairs of shoes and boots the company makes every year			1
@entity55 's descendants sold the business to @entity2 in 2006 but little has changed otherwise			1
the shop is still half boutique and half theatre museum , with signed pictures of famous performers and a can - can costume permanently on display			0
on the floor , a smooth red carpet evokes the world of cabaret			0
' that is where tap dancers test the shoes , ' explains bootmaker @entity71 , the current director of @entity6			2
according to the 35 - year - old , the job of creating the shoes is a delicate one and the atelier employs five expert cobblers to create them			2
' there are about 250 steps in the production of each shoe , ' he explains			0
' and a pair can involve anything between 20 and 60 hours of work			0
' the @entity2 takeover has ensured the company 's future by guaranteeing a steady flow of orders , @entity71 adds			2
as a result , some of their top - selling styles are the calf - length , blue and red mini-boots in which the can - can is performed			0
beautiful : the shoes at @entity6 take between 20 and 60 hours to make and as a result , cost between £ 1,200 and £ 2,800 per pair man of the moment : @entity71 photographed in the workshop of the @entity105 , where he is creative director in the window : a selection of custom - made shoes on display in the window of @entity105 which is located just 650ft from the iconic @entity2 thanks to @entity29 's attention to detail , dancers can thump the stage floor repeatedly in confidence : the heels are specially designed to spread and absorb the shocks			1
' stage shoes have to be extremely high - quality , both from a technical and an aesthetic point of view , ' says @entity71			0
the laces on the can - can boots are only there to enhance leg length : a zip on the outside of the boot actually does the job of keeping the dancers ' ankles fully supported			0
but while @entity29 still supplies shoes to the @entity2 , it regularly makes shoes to order for film - makers as well			1
recent examples have included the high heels that featured in @entity140 - @entity139 production @entity142 à table , or , as it 's known in @entity144 , me , myself and @entity146 , and the roman - era footwear sported by @entity149 cartoon heroes @entity150 and @entity151			0
@entity152 , the @entity153 - nominated star of silent film , @entity155 , is another client and slipped into a pair of spurred @entity6 boots for the cinema adaptation of another cartoon strip , @entity160			1
delicate : a @entity2 dancer shows off her pretty beige and gold leather strappy shoes stunning : one of the custom made shoes created at @entity105			2
clients include @entity0 and @entity155 actor , @entity152 that 's how you do it : @entity6 shoemaker @entity172 works on a boot destined for the feet of one of the @entity2 can - can dancers handmade : @entity172 painstakingly hand - stitches the leather upper on a pair of boots he is making for a dancer at the @entity2 ' we modified the interior of the boot to make it easier for the actor to appear bow - legged like @entity160 , ' reveals @entity71			1
@entity0 turned to the company for her 2006 and 2008 tours , with the diminutive pop star requesting shoes with four - inch heels she could dance in and walk down stairs without looking at the steps			1
but if you 're planning to emulate @entity0 's style , you could be in for an expensive surprise			2
a bespoke pair of high heels costs between £ 1,230 and £ 1,650 while men 's made - to - measure shoes go for around £ 2,880			0
it is a price worth paying , @entity71 says , for a little piece of @entity8 history			0
' they are comfortable , they are beautiful and there is something timeless about them			0
' hard at work : mr @entity71 is in charge of the workshop which was bought by the @entity2 in 2006 but has a history that dates back to 1945 meet the team : @entity6 employs five full - time shoemakers at its @entity8 atelier , all of whom make the shoes and boots by hand variety : a selection of the shoe lasts used by the cobblers at @entity6			1
many of their clients come from the @entity2			0
