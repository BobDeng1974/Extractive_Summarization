@entity0 , a former acting director of the @entity1 , is in charge of a ' tech surge ' meant to turn the failed @entity5 website into a success in a single month ' @entity7 is fixable , ' a former @entity9 official tasked with resurrecting the disastrous @entity5 website assured reporters on friday			1
@entity0 , once the acting director of the @entity13 administration 's @entity1 , is now a management consultant			1
the @entity9 brought him in this week to evaluate the website 's woes and coordinate a plan to fix it			1
@entity18 ' team has tapped @entity19 , or @entity19 , as its systems integrator – the company responsible for overseeing the entire project			1
that job was previously done by the @entity24 , the government agency that arguably botched the job of coordinating 55 contractors ' work and supervising the website 's testing			1
the result has left @entity32 secretary @entity31 with egg on her face while she faces @entity36 ' calls for her to step down			0
' i did n't realize it would n't be operating optimally before the launch , ' she told reporters in @entity41 on friday			0
' we knew if we had another six months , we ’d probably test further			0
' @entity43 reported that she made the comments while on a tour of @entity47 where she watched counselors help people struggling to use @entity7			2
now , @entity0 explained , ' we are appointing what you can think of as a general contractor to manage the overall effort			0
there will be a relentless focus on speed and execution			0
' but qssi might not inspire confidence since it 's one of the primary contractors that was already on the job and contributing to the failed project			0
the @entity32 has already paid it $ 85 million for work on the website			1
@entity66 , a vp with @entity19 's parent company , told a congressional panel that software problems with @entity7 were all the government 's fault , and now his company will add to its $ 85 million haul with a bigger contract @entity7 has never worked as advertised , and is so fraught with bugs and glitches that only 3 out of 10 users who get past the registration bottleneck can then sign up for insurance for that money , @entity19 built the data hub that shared applicants ' information with insurance companies , the @entity84 and the @entity32			1
it also created the computer engine that registers individual consumers before they actually apply for insurance			2
that feature created the most visible internet - traffic bottleneck during the first two weeks following the public launch of @entity7			1
in congressional testimony on thursday , @entity92 , the executive vice president of @entity19 's parent company , blamed that problem on the government , saying the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) saddled @entity19 with a ' late decision ' to prohibit potential customers from seeing prices up - front			2
' this may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that would n't have occurred if consumers could window - shop anonymously , ' he told the @entity104			0
that feature has since been rolled back , following widespread complaints by @entity36 that the @entity9 erected the barrier in order to prevent @entity109 from experiencing ' sticker shock , ' and to collect personal information from website visitors whether or not they eventually enrolled in an @entity5 plan			2
in a web video published during the summer , the @entity32 insisted it was delivering @entity5 , and its insurance exchange website , ' on schedule ' -- but meeting the deadline came with a steep cost in quality control tech bugs with @entity7 are n't limited to the sign - up process : data files getting to insurance companies are often flawed as well @entity19 did not respond to phone calls seeking comment about its suitability to oversee a failed project it had already contributed to			1
in a brief statement , it said , ' working with @entity24 , qssi will help monitor , assess , prioritize and manage the technical operations of @entity7 to enhance the consumer experience			2
' @entity32 secretary @entity31 has seen calls for her resignation growing in number since the oct. 1 botched rollout of insurance exchanges under the new federal health care law @entity0 said during his conference - call briefing that he expected great things			0
' by the end of november , the vast majority of consumers will be able to successfully and smoothly enroll through @entity7 , ' he said			2
that may be a tall order			0
in addition to web traffic - related roadblocks , much of the data coming through the @entity7 data hub to individual insurance companies is arriving in a garbled state , officials have admitted			1
in some cases , minor children have been wrongly identified as spouses			0
in another , a man ; s data sheet reported that he had three wives			0
subscribers may not know those mistakes are in an insurer 's computer system until they actually use their policies and create chaos for doctors , hospitals and pharmacies			2
as it is , @entity0 claimed that 90 per cent of website visitors can successfully create an account on the site , but conceded that actually applying for an insurance plan was a ' volatile ' process in which only 30 per cent succeed			1
@entity24 has reported that more than 700,000 accounts have been created since oct. 1 on @entity7 and individual states ' health insurance exchange websites			1
but new concerns are emerging that a majority of those accounts may be used to enroll in @entity182 , not to purchase insurance plans			0
the federal government is n't scheduled to release actual insurance enrollment numbers until mid-november .			0

@entity19 built registration bottleneck and data hub that is *transmitting* *mangled* enrollment data to insurers , collecting $ 85 million
firm will now be in charge of overseeing the website 's overall repair
former @entity9 acting *budget* director tasked with resurrecting @entity7 claims it 's ' fixable '
90 per cent of users can create accounts but just 30 *percent* of that group can actually apply for insurance
