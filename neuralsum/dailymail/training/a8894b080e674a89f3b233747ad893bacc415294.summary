with her long blonde locks , curvaceous figure and elfin features , 40 - something @entity0 is a woman few men would turn down			0
but there ’s a catch			0
@entity0 is n’t really a woman at all			0
instead , she ’s a retired property developer from @entity8 named @entity9			0
@entity9 is one of a growing number of men for whom time off means time spent dressed in an elaborate body suit , complete with breasts and a vagina , designed to make them look like the glamorous women they are not			2
unlike transgender people , ‘ maskers ’ , or ‘ rubber dollers ’ as they ’re also known , do not feel born in the wrong body			1
for them , dressing up as a member of the opposite sex is a simply a way to have fun			1
‘ they ’re just like what they call “ vanilla people ” - that ’s you and me - except for at night or on special occasions , they like to put on a mask			2
why not ? ’ her son @entity55 , who also works at @entity39 , adds : ‘ i do n't think it would be fair to call them gay or even attracted to other men			1
’ ‘ it 's about fun			1
a lot of men have fun by pretending to be women			2
not all of them even want to be hot			0
some want to be nasty hags			0
’ unlike transgender people , ' maskers ' do not feel born in the wrong body - it 's just their way of having fun one masker who has no interest in being a nasty hag is @entity9 , who following a painful divorce , has spent the last 12 years dressing up as @entity0			1
but while many of the maskers who appear in new @entity31 documentary , @entity30 , say it ’s all about having fun ; for 70 - year - old @entity9 , matters do n’t appear quite so simple			1
' that 's why i do this , ’ he breathes as he pouts at his reflection in the bathroom mirror , ‘ because i think i look amazing			1
‘ i just ca n't believe that 's a 70 - year - old man in the mirror and that 's why i do this , ’ he continues			1
‘ if i saw a 70 - year - old man in the mirror i would quit this tomorrow			0
‘ asked what he sees when he looks at his dolled up reflection , he replies : ' an exciting looking female , ’ adding : ‘ if i saw a woman like this and she asked me to go hang out , i 'd say yeah			1
‘ for him , the appeal of @entity0 seems to lie partly in the fact that for him , dating real women has been something of a disappointment			0
‘ you see , after all , i 'm 70 - years - old and i 've tried dating , and when i 'm dating , the women i meet are generally 55 to well up into their 60s , ’ he explains			1
‘ some of them are in really good shape for their age but they do n't look anything like this and it 's very difficult to date when you have this to come home to			1
’ but not every masker has a troubled love life			0
for @entity123 , a @entity124 bartender who lives with his girlfriend , @entity126 , dressing up is all about escapism			0
@entity9 , finds that the appeal of dressing as @entity0 seems to lie partly in the fact that for him , dating real women has been something of a disappointment @entity123 , a @entity124 bartender who lives with his girlfriend and goes by the female name of ' @entity134 ' dresses up for escapism ‘ i get enjoyment out of it , i get a sense of escapism out of it , ’ he reveals			1
‘ i 'm just out to have fun			1
it 's like the extension of another persona within me that just wants to go out and have fun			0
‘ the conundrum is people ask : “ what do you do when you get dressed up ? ” and the answer is : not much			0
‘ sometimes i just take photos to put up on masking websites , other times it just happens to be who i want to be that day			0
’ secrets of the @entity157 will air tonight at 10pm on @entity31 but @entity123 ’s masking career has n’t always gone smoothly			1
while girlfriend @entity126 is happy to accept his alter - ego @entity134 , he spent 15 years hiding her from his parents – and from his neighbours			0
‘ i would n't walk 20 steps down the road dressed as a doll because i know general society in the area we live in would be very , very against it , ’ he explains			1
‘ who knows what could happen ? ’ one masker who is far less reticent about his hobby is @entity175 , a @entity179 father - of - six who works as a forklift driver in a warehouse			1
according to @entity175 , not only does masking make him feel good , it also helps him to bond with his daughters			0
‘ i try to find ways to fit in and be involved with the daughters , and that sometimes means make - up and fingernails and things like that as well , ’ he explains			2
‘ you do n't have to have your guard up and necessarily be afraid of other people if you want to dress in a way that makes you feel really good			1
‘ one guy in particular that i trust at work - he knows that i put on the boobies ! ’ but not everyone is quite so understanding			2
@entity175 ’s wife @entity198 is his second , met and wed after his first marriage broke up because of his penchant for rubber dolling			0
‘ this does affect my relationships because i make my priorities and sometimes other people are not happy about my choices , ’ he admits			2
so is it all worth it ? @entity175 ’s friend ‘ @entity211 ’ , a 56 - year - old who is also father of six , thinks it is			2
‘ when i 'm in my male mode , i go out in public and i just blend in , ’ he confesses			2
‘ when i walk down the street , people do n't pay any attention to me			2
‘ but when i dress up , put this mask on and the wig , it 's like being a beautiful woman walking down the street			0
‘ you become one of the beautiful people and you draw a lot of attention , and attention is not something i 've had a lot of			0
