looking at 10 million tweets posted from 373 different sites across the country , the team ranked the saddest and happiest states and cities based on the frequency of happy and sad words posted onto the social networking site			1
dubbing the mathematical formula created to collate the information as a ' hedonometer ' , the scientists discovered that @entity20 , @entity21 was the happiest city , while @entity22 in @entity23 ranked as the most miserable			2
state in deeper blue are most unhappy according to the 10 million tweets used in the @entity3 study , while the deep red states are happiest out of the 80 million or so words examined , the scientists used @entity32 's @entity31 web service to enable them to locate the words they had deemed for their study to be happy or sad			1
words such as love , beauty , hope , wonderful and rainbow were designated happy , while boo , ugly , damn , smoke , hate and lied were decided to represent an unhappy state of mind			0
the study conducted through geographical tweets from 2008 to 2011 revealed that @entity20 , @entity21 was the happiest city in the @entity47 the beautiful vista of @entity20 , @entity21 - known for wine growing and according to a new study its particularly happy residents ' our overall objective is to use web - scale text analysis to remotely sense societal - scale levels of happiness using the singular source of the micro-blog and social networking service @entity4 , ' the study 's introduction says according to the @entity62			1
as a broad sweep the study revealed that the bible belt stretching across the south and into @entity23 was less happy than the @entity67 and @entity68			1

explaining the study is a graph below that has the positive and negative phrases next to them and up or down arrows			0
the plus or minus shows whether the word is considered happy or sad			0
while the up or down arrow points to whether the word was used more or less so in each city - in this case the happiest , @entity20 and the saddest , @entity22			1
using the word 's * * t ' as an example of a negative word , it was clearly used less in @entity20 than in @entity22			0
the bars in the graphs show that the lack of the use of that word in @entity20 helped it rise to the top , whith the opposite being true for @entity22			0
in fact , looking at @entity22 , it is clear to see that the only positive words on its graph or lol and haha , while the rest were negative			0
how @entity4 was used to collate information to determine how happy @entity20 , @entity21 was compared to @entity22 , @entity23 critics of the list point out that using @entity4 is not the most scientific or comprehensive way to compile a list such as this			0
the list does not seem to take into account differences in language use among different cities , states and demographic and gender groups across the country			2
the @entity3 scientists identified people with @entity118 ancestry to be happier than @entity119 , which could simply mean that @entity118 @entity119 use breezier language			2
