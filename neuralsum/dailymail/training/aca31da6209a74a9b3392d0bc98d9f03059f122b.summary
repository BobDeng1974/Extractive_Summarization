white people will be a minority in the @entity2 by 2044 while the rest of the population will be a mixture of different ethnicities , according to a new survey			2
the next 30 years will see an ageing white population reduced from 75 per cent of @entity2 citizens today to 49.7 per cent in 2044 , the first year minorities will outnumber whites			1
in the same time period the @entity13 population will soar from 16 per cent today to 25 per cent , while the @entity15 population will nearly double from 4 per cent to 7.9 per cent			1
the year 2044 will mark the first time that ethnic minorities will outnumber white @entity2 , with the @entity13 population growing from 17 per cent now to 25 per cent , while the @entity15 population will nearly double while whites will still be the single largest ethnic group in @entity2 by 2044 , when all the minorities are added together , it will form a ' majority minority ' population			1
that trend will continue into 2060 when white people will make up around 44 per cent of @entity2 , according to research by @entity28			2
as younger generations opt for having fewer children , and delay parenthood into later life , deaths will begin to outnumber births in the white population by 2025 , when numbers will start to decline			1
by 2060 white people will still make up the majority of the senior population , with 55 per cent of over 65s being white , but among the young that drops to 48 per cent , with 64 per cent being minorities			0
by 2060 white @entity2 will make up the majority of seniors , but among the young that drops to 48 per cent , with 64 per cent coming from minorities during the next 50 years the number of @entity13 and @entity15 people will more than double , while the mixed race population will expand by more than three times , despite still making up the smallest single group			1
according to @entity52 , a researcher for @entity28 , the new projections show a greater than expected increase in the @entity15 population , thanks in part to higher immigration , while the gain is slightly lower than expected for @entity13 , as the birth rate begins to decline			2
the black population will see only a modest increase between now and 2044 , rising from 12.3 per cent according to the 2010 census , to 12.7 per cent according to this research			0
@entity64 , a spokesman for researchers @entity65 , told the @entity66 : ' thirty percent all grandparents in @entity2 have a grandchild of a different race or ethnicity , and the diversity in this country is growing in so many ways , we are just starting to get a grasp on those changes			0
' gay parents , when they adopt , there is a high rate of multicultural adoptions			0
we have all these new variation and permutations of the @entity2 family			0
' it â€™s going to continue to happen , and the highest growth is coming from people of color , but they are mixing and merging and having children with people of every race , and it is going to continue to be that way			0
