by @entity0 published : 12:22 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 02:14 est , 19 april 2013 a nuclear power station in @entity2 has been leaking radioactive waste , which can increase the risk of developing cancer , for months according to the @entity6			1
routine tests on boreholes drilled close to the @entity10 plant found traces of tritium measuring more than seven times the agreed level			1
but plant owners @entity14 have reassured residents that it is unlikely that contaminated water has seeped into the local domestic supply			1
@entity20 : the @entity10 power station n @entity2 has been leaking more than the agreed levels of tritium although the substance , a radioactive variant of hydrogen , can increase the risk of cancer , according to the @entity30 in the @entity31 , it is considered one of the least dangerous nuclear waste products			1
normal levels of tritium , agreed with the @entity6 and measured in @entity36 , are usually considered to be anything under 100 per litre of water			1
but the tests in the boreholes close to @entity10 showed levels of 760			1
the @entity6 said : ' @entity14 informed the @entity6 and the @entity42 in september 2012 and in december 2012 that they had monitored elevated levels of tritium in the groundwater on the @entity10 nuclear licensed site			1
' @entity10 is a significant distance from any boreholes used for drinking water abstraction			1
as a precaution , the local water authority has been informed of the results			0
' @entity14 are conducting an investigation into the source of the tritium			0
any regulatory response will be informed by the results of this investigation			0
' owner : @entity14 says that work is well underway to rectify the tritium levels the @entity61 confirmed that levels of tritium were normal elsewhere in @entity10 's surroundings and added that the power station is allowed to discharge tritium in the environment under permit			1
the @entity70 's guideline level for the maximum amount of tritium in drinking water is 10,000 @entity36 per litre			2
tritium can inhaled , ingested and even absorbed through the skin and is a naturally occuring form of hydrogen found in the environment anyway			2
a spokesman for @entity14 said : ' we take our responsibilities to the environment very seriously			0
at our sites we continually strive to improve our environmental performance by adopting best practice			0
' we routinely monitor , record and report on our environmental discharges and sample our water			0
out of action : the @entity10 power station , pictured in late 2005 , ceased operation in 2006			2
normal levels of tritium have been monitored elsewhere around the site ' samples analysed during routine quarterly sampling of groundwater at @entity10 indicated levels of tritium above the agreed @entity101 investigation level of @entity102			1
this has been identified and isolated to one small area on site			0
' work is well underway to resolve this issue and the @entity6 and @entity42 site inspectors are being kept informed of the progress being made			0
the @entity110 is also being kept informed			0
' the environmental impact is negligible and there is no risk to the public or our employees			0
' tritium levels in boreholes on the station boundary have been checked and confirmed to be at background levels and the local water company has confirmed that the local water system is unaffected			1
' the company added that drinking two litres of water containing a concentration of 850 @entity36 per litre of @entity74 would result in less than 0.1 per cent of the average annual radiation dose received per person in the @entity128			0
this is the equivalent of eating two medium - sized baked potatoes everyday for a year			0
@entity10 is two advanced gas cooled reactors which began operations in 1983 and 1985			2
it remains operational after @entity10 was closed in 2006 .			2

@entity10 in @entity2 has been leaking more than agreed levels of tritium
but the variant of hydrogen has not seeped into domestic water supply
even if it had , the levels *detected* would pose no danger to the public
