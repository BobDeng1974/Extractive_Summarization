i ’ll be honest with you			0
it ’s an unlikely story			0
but then again , so was coming back from 3 - 0 down against @entity3 , with three goals in six minutes and then winning the @entity5 on penalties as a result			1
one night in @entity8 is a new @entity10 comedy caper film ( adapted from the popular stage play ) based around @entity12 ’s triumphant night in the @entity13 in 2005			1
that was an evening of incredible thrills , spills and heightened drama			0
the film does n’t match up to those exacting standards , it has to be said			2
but it does have an honest heart beating at the centre of it			0
and it does do a decent job of tapping into the whirlwind of emotions that being a diehard football fan is all about			0
videos scroll down to watch one night in @entity8 is driven by the character of @entity32 , who is played by @entity33 ( right ) caught up in the middle of the story are two down - on - their - luck cabbies , @entity32 and @entity37 , who , by fair means , but mainly foul , contrive to get to @entity8 with their sons for the game			1
prolific star of the big and small screen @entity43 is @entity32 , whose story drives the film along			1
while @entity49 - to whom we should all remain eternally grateful for bringing the world @entity46 - plays his pal			2
and gets to be the moral compass and steal the best laughs in the process			0
their journey from @entity12 to @entity57 , and back again is fuelled by the likes of a slavering loan shark , a ‘ free spirited ’ ex wife , @entity57 gangsters , stolen artifacts , police raids , and a big bag of money			1
none of which ever manages to be anything other than what you ’ve seen many times before			0
the film documents the club 's @entity5 victory in 2005 where they came back from 3 - 0 down after @entity78 's header , @entity75 and @entity76 scored to take the game to extra time but that is just about ok , because director @entity82 pushes the whole thing along at a fair lick , so there is no need to brood too long on the flimsy nature of the characters and events			1
however , there is more			0
and it ’s the more that just made the whole film just a bit too untidy for me , at times			2
because there is also the story of @entity32 and his son using the journey to rekindle their fractured relationship - through frequent acoustic guitar - based song ! while there ’s the mawkish sentimentality of @entity32 ’s dead dad ’s frequent appearances			1
the film taps into the emotions @entity12 fans were feeling during the historic final against @entity3 @entity113 and @entity78 kiss the @entity5 trophy after that dramatic victory against @entity3 and seeing as this is no @entity117 blockbuster , the cast of thousands is probably more like a couple of dozen			1
so the crowd scenes do feel a little sterile			0
nevertheless , and in spite of these reservations , as i say there is some genuine pluck and spirit at the core of this film			2
the two leads work very nicely off of each other in particular			0
while @entity131 , who plays @entity32 ’s ex-wife @entity132 ( with lavish scouse accent attached ) gets to share some screen time with a newcomer to the big screen - one @entity136			1
suffice to say , @entity137 can sleep easy when they ’re casting for @entity139 in future silver screen projects			0
one night in @entity8 may indeed be the tall tale of one particular football club ’s night of triumph , and the supporters who celebrated it			1
but there is plenty going on in this film that speaks to the football fan in all of us			2
and it does so with if not exactly huge laughs , but then certainly at least a cheeky , knowing wink			0
