social housing tenants at a new multi-million pound development have been told to keep off a section of grass because it is reserved for the owners of the building 's luxury apartments			1
tenants residing in the 43 affordable flats at the new one @entity10 complex in @entity11 , @entity12 , will not be allowed on the development 's ' podium garden ' when it is completed in 2017			1
property developer @entity16 was granted permission to ban all tenants from the special area , unless they pay an additional service charge , during a @entity23 planning committee meeting			2
it is being developed by @entity16 and will overlook the @entity44 original planning proposals for the one @entity10 complex , where some apartments are worth up to £ 15million , allowed social housing tenants access to all of the grounds			1
however , the decision was reversed following approval from the council and now any tenant who wishes to enjoy the ' podium garden ' , which includes a courtyard , fountain and lily pond , will have to pay an additional surcharge			2
according to @entity16 , rent for @entity60 – the social housing section of the one @entity10 development – starts at a minimum of £ 171 a week for a one - bedroom flat , rising to a maximum of £ 161 a week for a three - bedroom flat			2
an additional service charge , which includes heating and water bills , ranges from £ 29 to £ 62 a week depending on flat size			2
@entity16 said the cost of maintaining the ' podium garden ' would increase the additional service charge by around 20 per cent			1
it means the garden area - which is located between blocks three and four - is predominantly designated for those living in privately - owned riverside apartments at the development , which are on the market for between £ 1.5million and £ 15million			1
at the deciding committee meeting last tuesday , @entity16 argued that the social housing tenants would still be able to use a communal children 's play area and a roof garden on top of their eight - storey block			2
in submitting its request to charge tenants a surcharge for use of the ' podium garden ' , @entity16 said it was necessary because of the cost of maintaining the area			0

the developer said those in the luxury apartments would have a 24 - hour service to a @entity127 concierge and access to a spa , gym and indoor golf simulator			0
at the committee meeting , @entity132 , director of planning at @entity23 , said the exclusion of social housing tenants was ' not seen as any significant restriction on how they enjoy their property '			2
however , @entity139 , @entity141 @entity140 , said : ' this trend shows contempt for ordinary people , and is about developers selling luxury flats to rich investors who do n't want to mix with local people			0
' mayor @entity149 and councils have been turning a blind eye to this for too long			0
' they should simply refuse applications that have separate facilities or that refuse any affordable housing on this basis			0
' @entity158 mp for @entity159 and @entity160 also criticised the council 's decision			0
he said : ' @entity23 has dropped the ball here - they should have thought about this more carefully before it went to planning committee			0

the developers said in a statement : ' @entity191 had previously expressed concerns about the maintenance costs associated with their own communal roof gardens as well as the level of their service charge			0
' these issues are exacerbated by access to the podium garden which brings with it a separate additional service charge that pays for management and maintenance of the garden , fob access through one of the private blocks and maintenance of the access areas			1
' in reality , the affordable housing residents on this development will enjoy three times as much communal amenity space per home as the private residents			0
' every affordable home on this site enjoys two substantial roof - top communal gardens with amazing views over the river @entity44 , @entity220 and @entity10			0
