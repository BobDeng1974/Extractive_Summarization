young @entity0 are heading straight to overextended @entity2 departments because they are unable to get suitable appointments with @entity4 , according to a new report			1
it comes as waiting times in @entity2 departments hit record levels for the second week running with tens of thousands of patients left for up to 19 hours			1
a report by @entity12 found people aged 18 to 34 are more than twice as likely to visit @entity2 departments or walk - in centres than those aged 55 and over			1
the charity ’s analysis of @entity22 gp patient survey data found young adults are also much less likely than older people to be able to see a gp when they need to			1
based on answers from 900,000 people across @entity36 , the report found younger adults were more than twice as likely to not be able to secure an appointment with their gp at a convenient time as those aged 65 and over			1
it also found levels of satisfaction and trust in their family doctors were radically lower than among elderly people , with less than a third rating them as ' very good '			2
in contrast , people aged 75 are twice as likely to rate their service as ' very good '			1
citizens advice said the findings showed that access to @entity4 ' is n't meeting the needs of younger adults '			0
it comes after figures released earlier this week showed hospital waiting time targets were being missed as they struggle to cope with a record number of admissions			1
one in eight people aged between 18 and 34 has gone to @entity2 or an @entity22 walk - in centre when they have not been able to get a @entity24 appointment - but the number was only one in 17 among people aged 55 or over @entity36 said just 89.8 per cent of patients were seen within four hours last week , compared with the target of 95 per cent			1
more than 10,000 patients were forced to wait longer than four hours for a bed once a decision was made to admit them into hospital from @entity2			2
@entity74 , chief executive of citizens advice , said : ' gp services need to keep up with 21st century lifestyles			1
' long working hours means it can be difficult for younger adults to get an appointment with a gp , let alone one at a convenient time			2
' as a result some people are struggling to access the medical advice they need			0
' it is in the @entity22 ' interest to get primary healthcare for younger adults right and ensure services fit around busy working lives			0
' a failure to meet their needs piles more pressure on budgets and is an inefficient use of scarce @entity22 resources			0
dr @entity97 , of @entity36 , has urged the public not to go to @entity2 or call an ambulance unless it is a genuinely urgent case ' many gps are already transforming the way they provide services and embracing new technologies			1
it is vital that they keep up with how people of all ages want to engage with public services including healthcare			2
' citizens advice said almost 4,500 people contacted the charity last year with issues about gp services			1
it found that 30 per cent of young adults surveyed had found their experience of @entity4 to be ' very good ' , compared with 64 per cent of those aged 75 and over			0
one in seven people ( 14 per cent ) aged 18 to 34 could not see a gp last time they tried to make an appointment			1
one in eight ( 13 per cent ) of younger adults did not get any professional help for a health problem after being unable to see their gp			0
dr @entity97 , national director of commissioning operations for @entity36 , said : ' pressures on our @entity2 services continue to increase significantly			1
' we have admitted more people to hospital this week to take care of them than in any previous week on record			2
i want to pay tribute to the staff dealing with that – they are doing a brilliant job			0
' while we are now below the extremely high waiting time standards that we set ourselves , the service we provide remains robust			0
' the @entity22 ’s waiting times for urgent treatment are among the best for any major country that measures them			1
' looking ahead , we need to transform the @entity22 so it is better able to cope with demand , as set out in the @entity147			0
' we have today set out how we plan to drive this forward next year , allocating additional @entity22 funding to every part of the country			0
' as we come into the holiday period , it is important people continue to look after themselves and nip problems in the bud			0
they should ensure they have proper medication , get their flu jab if they have not done so , and get advice from their pharmacist			0
' the study suggests the @entity22 is still unable to cater for a working population that wants family doctors to be available at times to fit in with the lives of busy working people			2
fifty walk - in centres have shut down since 2010 , and there are now only 185 left in @entity36			0
from january 2015 , gps will be allowed to move away from the catchment area approach to registering patients			0
this means that @entity4 can choose to register patients near their place of work rather than near their homes , though they wo n’t have to offer this option			0
and as of march next year , all surgeries must have an online booking system , instead of the specific times at which to call to make appointments that many gp surgeries have .			2

people aged 18 to 34 twice as likely to visit @entity2 than those aged over 55
based on report by @entity12 from 900,000 people across country
comes as @entity2 waiting times hit record levels for second week running
charity says gp services ' need to keep up with 21st century lifestyles '
