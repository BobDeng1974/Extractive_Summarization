a couple from @entity1 has seen their family more than double after they adopted five orphaned siblings from @entity7 who had sent them an email imploring : ' we need a mommy and daddy			1
' @entity13 , 17 , @entity14 , 15 , @entity15 , 12 , @entity16 , 11 , and @entity17 , nine , are now settling into school and home life in @entity20 , where they saw snow for the first time after touching down in december			1
before the life - changing move , they spent seven years living in an orphanage after their parents died from tuberculosis			2
the children refused to be split up , making adoption seem unlikely			2
but in january 2011 , they met an @entity33 visiting the orphanage who helped them write the pleading email to send back to his friends in the @entity33			1
new additions : @entity40 and @entity41 ( back ) already had two children , @entity43 , 19 , ( right ) and @entity44 , 3 , when they took in the orphans : @entity13 , 17 , @entity14 , 15 , @entity15 , 12 , @entity16 , 11 , and @entity17 , 9 when @entity41 and @entity47 , who have a three - year - old daughter and a 19 - year - old daughter from @entity40 's previous marriage , received the message , they did n't think too much of it			1
' i remember @entity40 and i looking at that e-mail and thinking about how beautiful the kids were , ' @entity41 , 30 , wrote on her blog			1
' i even thought , " someone rich should adopt them "			0
and then life went on			0
' shortly after , @entity41 took a trip to an orphanage in @entity62 and was devastated by how many young babies were without parents while her own daughter had the security of a home			1
then she started thinking about those five beautiful faces she had seen in the email			2
' somebody 's got to do it , and why ca n't it be us ? ' @entity41 said to her husband			1
finally home : the @entity77 brood is pictured in the airport after touching down in @entity1 in december ' we may eat a lot of spaghetti			2
i will never buy another $ 100 pair of jeans again , and who cares ? if those are my reasons , it 's just practicality , ' she told @entity88			2
and so they embarked on the year - long battle to bring the children from @entity7 to @entity1 , hitting numerous roadblocks along the way , including missing identification records for the children			1
but over chats on @entity97 and visits to @entity7 , the @entity77 soon learned the different personalities of the children and began to think of them as their own			1
' we got told " no " a lot of times , and by then we were already crazy about these kids , so it was a rough part of the story , ' mrs @entity41 told @entity108			2
' and you had to keep trusting that we were fighting for something that you knew was yours to fight for			0
' old life : the children are pictured chatting with their parents - to - be on @entity97 from their orphanage sticking together : the children had been in the orphanage for seven years after their parents died of @entity117 with the help of members of their church , the @entity77 raised the $ 85,000 needed for the adoptions to bring the children to their new home before @entity125			1
one particularly excited member of the welcoming committee at the airport was 19 - year - old @entity43 , who had not seen her father , stepmother or little sister since they left for @entity7 five weeks prior			1
she said she could not wait to meet her five new brothers and sisters			0
' i have n't met them , know the personalities , know who they are , ' she said			0
' i 'm excited about that			0
' the @entity77 returned to their home to find it had been scrubbed clean by the community , with a stocked kitchen , @entity125 presents wrapped under the trees and new bedrooms for the children			2
new life : the children are now attending @entity33 schools and their @entity151 is improving all the time @entity152 love : nine - year - old @entity153 holds her new little sister , three - year - old @entity44 ' people painted beds , people framed pictures - people made the girls ' room look like they had lived here for years			1
it was awesome to come home to that , ' @entity41 said			1
they also returned to a garden full of snow , which the youngsters had never seen before			0
life has picked up pace in the @entity77 household			0
@entity40 , 43 , runs a lawn care business , while @entity41 has given up her recruiting job to stay at home full time			1
the children 's @entity151 is improving and they have started attending four different schools because of their ages , making for some busy mornings in the home			1
' the sound of life is different , ' @entity41 said			2
' it 's a lot more loud and crazy , and half of it 's in @entity188 , half of it 's in @entity151 , and half of it 's in @entity193			0
but it 's really good			0
there 's a strange peace amidst the chaos			0
' @entity198 : the community rallied around the @entity77 to help them raise enough money for the children moving on : the couple returned home ( pictured ) to new bedrooms , a stocked kitchen and @entity125 present under the tree , organised by members of their church			2
they are now moving to a larger home but life is working out well , and most of that is thanks to the children , @entity41 said			1
pictures over @entity218 show them grinning alongside their new siblings and neighbours			0
' these kids are fabulous			0
they have great attitudes , ' she said			0
' nobody fought me on going back to school the second day			0
everybody was up and ready , showers going on their own			0
so their attitudes are making the transition a bazillion times easier			0
' she added that as they prepare to move into a bigger home , the children 's biggest concern is whether they can take the carpet			1
