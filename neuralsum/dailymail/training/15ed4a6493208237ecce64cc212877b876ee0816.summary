@entity54 , prosecuting , told the court that @entity0 was arrested when police received a tip - off from the @entity59 authorities that he had been accessing a file - sharing website to download child pornography			1

' mr @entity54 said @entity0 was released on bail pending the forensic examination of his computers , which revealed he had sexually abused two young girls , aged between eight and 10 , and filmed it			1
' there was too much material to examine all of it			0
there was simply not the resources available to go through all the material and the decision was made to prioritise , ' mr @entity54 said			0
' but estimates of a total exceed one million			0
it is the largest amount in this part of the country as far as we are aware of			0

he said he deserves whatever punishment he is given			0
' he expresses to your honour , to the probation officer and to the psychiatrist deep regret and shame - powerless to do anything about what he has done by way of rectification			0

he told @entity154 : ' the magnitude is quite staggering			2
you had more than a million images of children being abused , including significantly high numbers of images of the worst type of abuse			2
' that was only a fraction because an analysis of your computer showed images of you raping and abusing a child			1
' the impact upon the victims is considerable			0
all though you can not recall it , the images tell their own story and provide the most graphic and appalling evidence of what you had done			0
