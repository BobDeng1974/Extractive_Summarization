it was the moment millions of @entity2 fans had waited almost two years for			2
but the much - anticipated return of the @entity5 crime drama left many baffled – and not just by the plot			1
some who tuned in for the start of the second series on monday night complained they struggled to understand actor @entity12 ’s @entity11 accent to the extent that they were forced to turn on the tv subtitles			1
while the opening episode , which had an audience of 7.2million , drew widespread praise and was quickly being talked about on @entity34 , many viewers said they had difficulty deciphering some of the dialogue			0
one wrote : ‘ still could n’t understand a word they were saying in @entity2 tonight – i need someone to translate the heavily accented mumbling			1
’ another added : ‘ challenge : try to watch @entity2 without subtitles			2
’ others singled out @entity12 , who plays dour detective inspector @entity21 , saying : ‘ @entity12 needs subtitles , with that accent do n’t understand a word he says			1
’ many viewers complained about having to use subtitles to understand @entity12 's mumbling on the show @entity12 and @entity54 , who plays @entity55 , were in court as @entity58 's husband denied murder this is not the first time @entity12 ’s voice has caused problems			1
he also starred in @entity64 , the @entity66 remake of @entity2 , with his @entity66 accent failing to impress both critics and audiences			0
on monday night , many @entity2 viewers were left scratching their heads – and not in the way the programme makers intended			2
fans said the show was confusing and complained that there had been no recap of the first series at the start			2
this left new viewers lost , while many who were avid watchers of the old series nearly two years ago were unable to remember the details needed to follow the plot			0
one tweeted : ‘ may as well have not watched the last series of @entity2 , not a clue who ’s who or what ’s happening			0
’ viewers complained about the accents of many of the cast members as well as the loud background noise @entity96 pleaded not guilty to the murder of @entity98 , 11 , despite his confession in the last show another added : ‘ anyone else watching @entity2 and ca n’t remember who everyone is or what went on last series ? ’ one @entity2 mystery was instantly seized on by the gloomy drama ’s more light - hearted fans – why are there so many former @entity111 stars in the cast ? they pointed out that seven had previously appeared in the @entity115 sci - fi series			1
@entity12 played @entity116 for five years while @entity117 – the @entity118 in @entity119 – had a long - running role as one of the time - traveller ’s companions			1
@entity124 has been a guest star , as has @entity125 , who plays journalist @entity126 in the @entity5 drama			1
three others in the new series appeared in @entity111 , including @entity130 , who was also in the spin - off , @entity131			1
many fans used social media to highlight this crossover			0
one wrote : ‘ @entity2 only cast actors who ’ve appeared in doctor who / doctor who spin - offs ? ’ another added : ‘ @entity2 , where @entity111 actors go on leaving the @entity139 , apparently			1
’ others joked that @entity2 had become a ‘ retirement home ’ for @entity111 stars and wrote ‘ i reckon dr who did it ’			0
the first series , set in a fictional @entity147 seaside town , involved the hunt for the killer of 11 - year - old @entity98			0
detective sergeant @entity55 , played by @entity124 , and @entity150 – who moved to the area from another force after his previous investigation fell apart in court – investigated numerous suspects before the killer was exposed , in a shocking twist , to be @entity58 ’s husband @entity158			0
monday ’s episode began in court with @entity58 surprising everyone by entering a not guilty plea			0
some viewers said the programme was unrealistic as retired barrister @entity165 , played by @entity166 , was given the job of prosecuting @entity58			0
one lawyer said : ‘ completely unrealistic court scenes and how counsel are appointed in murder cases – ca n’t @entity5 afford researchers ? ’ @entity5 said it had received ‘ fewer than five ’ complaints about mumbled dialogue			0
it added that although no recap of the first series was broadcast on monday , a four - minute clip recounting the plot had been circulated via social media and was available on the @entity5 website			1
of alleged legal inaccuracies in the plot , an @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ we consult extensively with advisers , but also have to balance what we consider to be the best creative decision for the drama – and the audience			2
‘ we ’re thrilled that we ’ve had such a positive response			0

return of @entity2 , starring @entity12 , was widely anticipated
but viewers criticised @entity12 's ' mumbling ' during the @entity5 drama
*claimed* they had to use subtitles and *re-watch* episode to understand it
others complained of loud music and poor @entity206 accents of cast
viewers said show *resembled* old cast of dr who series as @entity12 , @entity124 , @entity130 and @entity117 all appeared in the previous show
most were positive but some attacked show for *unbelievable* plot lines
