@entity0 believes beating @entity1 on friday night will be the first step to football overtaking rugby in @entity4			1
the @entity6 superstar became the first player to be named @entity9 footballer of the year for a fourth time at a @entity12 ceremony on monday night but it is a place at the @entity15 finals in @entity16 that @entity0 really craves			1
wales have not qualified for a major tournament since the 1958 @entity19 in @entity20 and @entity0 reckons that if @entity22 's side were to end that long wait then even the national sport of rugby would be eclipsed			1
@entity0 celebrates after scoring a late winner for @entity4 against @entity27 last month @entity0 shares a joke with @entity29 as he trains with the @entity4 squad in september that would be some task given @entity4 have won three @entity34 @entity33 in the last 10 years and came within a penalty kick of reaching the @entity37 final in 2011 , but @entity0 believes @entity9 football is on the threshold of a great new era			1
' we have massive potential and i want to make history with @entity4 and qualify for a major tournament , ' @entity0 said after picking up his fourth @entity9 player of the year award in five years			1
' i feel football can overtake rugby soon			1
i remember when i was younger the @entity48 was full every time i went to watch			0
' @entity37 has obviously overtaken it in recent years but i feel football is on the incline and we can get a lot of fans to the games and get the support behind us			0
' it 's not only important for us as a team to get to a major championship , but as a nation as a whole			0
' we want to inspire more kids to play football and become a better national team			0
' the @entity4 rugby team celebrate their @entity33 at the 2012 @entity34 @entity0 spared @entity9 blushes in @entity27 last month with his double strike , including a superb late free - kick winner , seeing off the @entity69 part - timers and ensuring the @entity15 campaign would get off to a winning start			1
despite the loss of key midfielders @entity75 and @entity76 through injury for this week 's home qualifiers against @entity1 and @entity79 , expectations remain high around @entity22 's squad with @entity0 providing the stardust to a group full of @entity84 players			1
that optimism has been reflected by a dramatic rise up the @entity88 rankings as @entity4 have climbed to 29th in the world , just two places short of their all - time high of 20 years ago			2
' we 've been together for quite a long time now , we get along really well and it 's really a tight - knit group , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity0 celebrates with @entity95 after the @entity97 forward scored for @entity6 at the weekend ' we 're growing as players and as long as everyone stays committed and working hard we can go on to achieve our goals			2
' we 've got off to a positive start in the group with three points and we feel we 've got the momentum behind us			0
' we want to carry that into the next game and get a positive result			0
' @entity1 are first up at the @entity108 on friday and it is only four months since @entity111 's side were gracing the @entity19 finals in @entity113			1
but @entity1 surprisingly lost their opening @entity15 qualifier at home to @entity79 last month and @entity111 's future is said to be far from clear			2
' we know they 're a very good side , they showed that by getting to the @entity19 and they 've obviously got some good players , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity0 will come up against @entity123 striker @entity122 ( above ) when @entity4 face @entity1 on friday night ' but we believe in ourselves and hopefully we can get the victory on friday			1
' we 've got two massive games but we just want to concentrate on friday and not think about anything else			0
' the fans can be the extra man			0
we have n't had too many big crowds in the past but i really feel we 're on the rise now			0
' as a team we 're playing better and getting the right results and that shows in the rankings			0
' we all firmly believe we 're pushing in the right direction , and hopefully the fans will come out and support us and we can give them a good performance .			0
