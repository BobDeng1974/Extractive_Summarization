by @entity0 photos taken 100 years ago of @entity2 preparing for the @entity3 have been brought to life after they were digitally coloured			1
the vivid snaps are in stark contrast to the grainy black and white photographs depicting the @entity3 that we are used to seeing			1
most of them were taken in july 1914 and show soldiers getting battle - ready at training camps in the @entity13			1
others depict the men dressed in their smart green uniforms on parade in a town square on the eve of war and then stood on a train station platform as they begin their journey to @entity23			2
as well as being filled with colour , some of the photos are tinged with poignancy as many of the men pictured never came back			2
this is one of a number of old @entity3 photographs to be digitally coloured on the left , young @entity36 poses for a photograph in 1914 - such pictures were common at the outbreak of the war when patriotism and national fervour swept the country			1
on the right , @entity46 and @entity47 pictured before @entity46 , on the left , was killed two years later			1
@entity47 was seriously wounded and died in 1962 this photograph shows in vivid detail a group of territorial soldiers leaving a train station in @entity54 , @entity55 they include sergeant @entity57 who is pictured stood alongside his younger brother @entity47 in front of a green hedge in the summer of 1914			1
he was shot and killed at @entity61 , north west @entity23 , two years later			1
another image in the gallery that has been reproduced in colour was shot in 1920 - two years after the war - and depicts a town ’s first armistice day commemorations at the newly - built war memorial			1
the distinctive red , white and blue of the @entity71 flag draped on top of the memorial provides a striking contrast to the solemn black and brown overcoats worn by those gathered			1
most of the men photographed served in the @entity31 at the start of the war			2
the black and white photos have been given the 21st century colour makeover to mark the opening of an exhibition to be staged by the @entity86 project on august 4			1
@entity87 , who is leading the project , said : ' in applying new technology to historic images previously seen only in black and white we are able to cross the century long divide and bring individuals back to life , if only for that one moment in time			1
wounded servicemen in their ' hospital blues ' pose for a photograph in one of the 38 private residences converted into convalescent homes in @entity55 @entity102 rest during summer camp on the eve of the outbreak of war			1
the images were coloured using @entity109 software a @entity111 refugee at work in @entity114 and @entity115 factory in @entity54 , 1915			2
the images were reproduced by @entity117 , who painstakingly coloured in the pixels of the original photos ' we are used to seeing photographs and film in the grainy images of 100 years ago and to see them enhanced in this way is a fantastic window into a war that seems ever more real as a result			1
' we are proud to work with projects like colourising history in furthering the story of @entity55 at @entity3 as the centenary of the conflict approaches ever closer			1
' the photographs have been reproduced by @entity135 , of @entity136			2
he used @entity109 software to painstakingly colour in the pixels in the original photos			2
he said : ' there is a bit of guess work in terms of getting the colours absolutely right and a bit of artistic licence is required			2
' for instance , most of these photos were at the very start of the war so the uniforms would have been brand new and all been the same shade of khaki			2
a battalion of the @entity156 pictured parading in @entity158 market square on the way to war in august , 1914 on the left , a young girl on horseback poses for a photo with a @entity165 trooper in 1917			0
pictured right is the first @entity168 parade in @entity54 , 1920 ' one has to respect the content and whoever is in it and put aside what you think might look good in colour for the sake of it			0
' i always start with the flesh and skin tones and try and relate to the people in the picture			0
' then i work on the clothing			0
people say that they were taken in black and white and they should remain that way but the people who lived through the war did n’t experience it in black and white			1
' if there is just one person in the picture it would usually take me two or three hours but others have taken me half a day to do			0
' one of the photos that have been reproduced shows a young boy wearing an army uniform in honour of the @entity198 soldier , much like how a child would wear a replica football shirt today			1
two other images show a @entity111 refugee at work in a munitions factory in @entity54 in 1915 and wounded servicemen wearing their ‘ hospital blues ’ at a convalescent home in 1918			1
the photos can be viewed at the @entity55 at @entity210 exhibition at @entity54 from august 4			1
@entity135 , the artist responsible for breathing new life into these @entity3 photographs , spends anywhere from a couple of hours to half a day turning the black and white images into colour			1
using @entity109 , he selects a picture , zooms in to a high resolution then ' paints ' on new ' layers ' of colour to specific areas of the images			0
this could be green for background trees , or a mixture of lighter colours to create pinkish skin tones			0
mr @entity135 said : ' it helps if the photograph is a high resolution			0
it is better if it 's 300dpi or more because if it was n't i would n't be able to expand it to colour it pixel by pixel			0
' a lot of colourists in @entity241 use layers			0
i open it up and make it as big as i can without distorting it			0
' i prefer to colour the skin tones first , i always work on the skin tones first because the person you 're colouring then becomes a person			2
' with this @entity109 software that i use it is referred to as building it up layer by layer			0
skin tones are perhaps the first layer then build upon that			0
' then you may , depending on the age of the person , add other colours that make you a flesh as opposed to just pink			0
' the eye is another layer , and talking about military photographs , i add the uniform			2
generally if it 's a @entity198 soldier it 's usually khaki			1
so it 's not just a case of i paint the khaki colour			0
' finally if that 's all you 've got , the background is another layer - picking out a background layer that complements			0
' mr @entity135 said there was some artistic license required in order to use colours which were suitable - such as duller colours for late war uniforms which were likely faded			0
' it 's painting by numbers without the numbers			0
but it is n't the case of just slapping on any old bit of colour			0
you do have to have some artistic bent , if you like			0

grainy black and white photographs taken 100 years ago have been brought to life through digital colouring
