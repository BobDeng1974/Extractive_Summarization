rings of gas and dust are known to encircle @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , and @entity6			1
scientists recently discovered a fifth member of this haloed group known as @entity10 , which is one of a class of minor ' centaur ' planets			0
now astronomers have detected a possible ring system around a second centaur , @entity18 , suggesting that ringed bodies may be more common in our solar system previously thought			1
scientists have detected a possible @entity3 - like ring system ( pictured ) around a minor , @entity18 , suggesting that ringed bodies may be more common in our solar system previously thought like their mythological counterparts , centaurs are hybrids , embodying traits of both asteroids and comets			1
today , scientists estimate there are more than 44,000 centaurs in the solar system , concentrated mainly in a band between the orbits of @entity4 and @entity36			0
@entity18 , discovered in 1977 , was the first planetary body categorised as a centaur , after the mythological @entity40 creature -- a hybrid of man and beast			2
to discover the rings , the @entity44 observed the dimming of a star as @entity18 passed in front of it , briefly blocking the light			1
by looking at how much and when the light was blocked , scientists say the centaur may possess a circulating disk of debris			0
' it 's interesting , because @entity18 is a centaur - part of that middle section of the solar system , between @entity4 and @entity36 , where we originally were n't thinking things would be active , but it 's turning out things are quite active , ' says @entity63 , a lecturer in @entity44 's @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			2
it follows the discovery of rings around a giant asteroid called @entity10 last year			2
' i try to imagine how it would be to stand on the surface of this icy object , small enough that a fast sports car could reach escape velocity and drive off into space , and stare up at a 20 kilometer wide ring system 1,000 times closer than the moon , ' said @entity80 of the @entity81 of the @entity10 study			0

while most centaurs are thought to be dormant , scientists have seen glimmers of activity from @entity18			1
@entity18 was discovered in 1977 by @entity105 recovery images have been found as far back as 1895 , it was the first - known member of a class of objects now known as centaurs , with an orbit between @entity3 and @entity5 starting in the late 1980s , astronomers observed patterns of brightening from the centaur , as well as activity similar to that of a streaking comet			1
in 2010 , @entity44 started to chart the orbits of @entity18 and nearby stars in order to pinpoint exactly when the centaur might pass across a star bright enough to detect			1
' there 's an aspect of serendipity to these observations , ' professor @entity63 says			0
' we need a certain amount of luck , waiting for @entity18 to pass in front of a star that is bright enough			1
@entity18 itself is small enough that the event is very short ; if you blink , you might miss it			1
' in light of these new observations , the researchers say that @entity18 may still possess symmetrical jets of gas and dust			1
but other interpretations may be equally valid , including the ' intriguing possibility , ' professor @entity63 says , of a shell or ring of gas and dust			0
pictured are the positions of known outer solar system objects			0
the centaurs are those objects ( in green ) that lie generally inwards of the @entity151 ( in blue ) @entity152 , who is a researcher at @entity44 's @entity153 , says it is possible to imagine a scenario in which centaurs may form rings			0
for example , when a body breaks up , the resulting debris can be captured gravitationally around another body , such as @entity18			2
rings can also be leftover material from the formation of @entity18 itself			2
nevertheless , @entity63 says the possibility of a second ringed centaur in the solar system is an enticing one			0
' until @entity10 's rings were found , it was commonly believed that these smaller bodies do n't have ring systems , ' @entity63 says			0
' if @entity18 has a ring system , it will show it 's more common than previously thought			1

minor planet is known as @entity18 and located between @entity3 and @entity5
discovery was made by studying dimming of star as it passed behind @entity18
astronomers say ringed bodies may be more common than first thought
researchers are still *unsure* how rings stay place on such a small ' planet '
