by @entity1 reporter it 's a sprawling @entity3 - style family home that remains one of the most distinguished properties in @entity6			1
but , like the original gingerbread finish that has lined the porch since its construction in 1893 , some aspects of this @entity9 house will never change - such as the previous inhabitants who refuse to leave			1
according to documents filed by former owners over time , the history associated of this home is very much alive			2
however , forgetting the ghost who supposedly stalks the hallways is nicknamed ' @entity22 ' , the current tenants are an all - american family with seven children , so it ca n't be too petrifying			1
it is said to be haunted by a 14 - year - old girl known as ' @entity22 ' the home was built in 1893 but has been extensively renovated , with many original features maintained buyer beware : current owners @entity37 and @entity38 , who have seven children , share stories of their ghost encounters the ' widows walk ' that sits atop the home is one of its most distinguished features - and a point of spiritual activity in fact , with this poltergeist said to be the spirit of a 14 - year - old girl , mother @entity49 says she treats her with the same approach she does her own brood			1
' she 's a kid , ' @entity57 said of the ghost to @entity59			2
' i have yelled at her like i would any other kid in the house			2
' ' @entity22 ' was the daughter of @entity63 , one of @entity9 's most successful early businessmen who built the house			1
however @entity63 's family was beset by tragedy			1
an infant died three days after birth			0
their son , @entity70 , 11 , died in 1902			0
@entity63 himself died — possibly of tuberculosis — in 1903 , leaving behind a 34 - year - old widow and three children			1
but perhaps the most notable calamity occurred in 1909 , when @entity63 's 14 - year - old daughter , @entity77 , was ironing on the porch with a gasoline - heated flat iron — a common appliance until @entity82 i. this is the iron that lead to the death of @entity86 ' - which is kept on display at the home by current owners @entity37 and @entity38 somehow , the gasoline spilled and @entity22 's clothes ignited			1
@entity93 , she ran ablaze down the street , with neighbors trying to put out the flames			0
she died not long after from her injuries			0
and today , some 105 years after the accident , the presence of ' @entity22 ' continues to be felt			2
' mostly what we have heard are footsteps up and down the stairs and across the hallway upstairs where her bedroom was , ' said father @entity38 , an anesthesiologist at the local hospital			2
' a closet door , we went to push the door shut and the door came back open			0
they pushed against it and it was kind of a tug and war with the door to the closet which normally does n't do that			0
' the current owners say they have never really been frightened of the ghosts they believe inhabit their home , but it has surprised them on many occasions shaking chandeliers is a very common characteristic of the house 's ghost activity , according to the owners so well - noted is its history , the @entity3 - style home features on the cover a book called @entity135 @entity136 and @entity49 show prospective buyers through their home with no way of escaping or avoiding the spookiness associated with their home ( it 's featured on the cover of a book called @entity135 ) the @entity57 's are trading on it as they attempt to sell up and move			1
the house and all of it 's mysteries has been listed for sale for $ 1.59 million			1
extensively renovated but with original features still intact , the home did not originally have an indoor bathroom or even kitchen			0
now it has five bathrooms and an expansive kitchen with granite finishes			0
' some pieces are original , some were added later and some are new , ' mrs @entity49 said			0
' the outside of the old house is all original			0
