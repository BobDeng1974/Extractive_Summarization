tea for me ! this extremely rare 500 - year - old cup @entity18 is pictured drinking from is one of only 17 left in the world			2
he paid a staggering £ 21m for the cup which has chickens and cockerels on it while most would expect an antique of such prominence to go directly into storage or on display , mr @entity18 decided he would put his chicken cup to a more immediate , and practical , use			1
