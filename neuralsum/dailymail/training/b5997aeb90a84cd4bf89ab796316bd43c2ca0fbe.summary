human minds could be downloaded into robots within 10 years , allowing human beings to ' live forever ' , says the @entity4 entrepreneur who heads a hi - tech research project called ' @entity6 '			1
@entity7 , a media entrepreneur , claims to have hired 30 scientists to reach this goal - and is now looking for other scientists to help with the project			1
' this project is leading down the road to immortality , ' says @entity7			1
' a person with a perfect @entity6 will be able to remain part of society			0

' @entity6 : @entity7 's ' @entity6 ' project aims to ' load ' human minds into robotic bodies within 10 years @entity7 , a 31 - year - old media entrepreneur , says that he aims to transplant a human brain into a robot body within 10 years			1
he says his technology will be of interest at first to the ' disabled and close to dying ' ‘ i understand these are some very big challenges for scientists , ’ @entity7 says			1

the project is called @entity6 after the @entity46 movie , set far in the future , where human soldiers use mind control to inhabit the bodies of human alien hybrids as they carry out a war against the inhabitants of a distant world			1
' the next effort of science will be to create a new body for the human being , ' says @entity7 , speaking at the @entity60 conference			1
' it will have a perfect brain - machine interface to allow control and a human brain life support system so the brain can survive outside the body			2
' @entity7 says that the system will at first be of interest to , ' disabled people and people at the edge of dying			2
' ' the third phase will be to create an artificial human brain , ' he says - a computer environment into which human minds can be uploaded			2
