by @entity0 bookmakers @entity1 will have to examine their flawed publicity strategy after a series of failed stunts caused widespread upset rather than generating interest			1
their latest limp effort was hiring a second plane to follow the ‘ @entity9 out ’ flypast over @entity11			1
it carried the message ‘ @entity17 back in 6 - 1 ’ , which created little stir and was n’t considered worthy of comment by @entity16 afterwards			1
this follows @entity1 ’s crass betting market on the @entity21 murder verdict and sending rainbow laces to football clubs trying to hitch cheap publicity on to the serious anti-homophobia issue			2
flawed : @entity1 flew a plane over @entity11 home of @entity16			2
the banner read ' @entity29 in 6/1 ' and it was not well received good idea ? @entity1 sent out rainbow boot laces in partnership with gay rights charity @entity34 , to tackle homophobia in football @entity38 manager @entity37 , suspended by his club after @entity40 revealed he was being investigated by the @entity41 for betting irregularities , has finally been charged , six weeks later , for multiple breaches of @entity44 ( b ) in relation to betting in competitions involving @entity38			2
@entity47 boast about having a ‘ mischief department ’ to dream up their tired ideas , with employee @entity50 , son of @entity52 frontbencher @entity51 , even having the title of ‘ mischief champion ’ on his business card			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we do irritate people , but our ambition is to entertain and the @entity16 banner did well on social media , which is what we wanted			2
we will keep having fun when it works			0
’ the good news is that @entity1 are not planning any ambush marketing during this week ’s @entity68 meeting			0
@entity70 ’s £ 2.5million compensation case against @entity71 is expected to be heard by a @entity73 managers ’ arbitration tribunal in may if mediation fails			1
the @entity76 believe @entity70 , who was sacked for ‘ imprudent and careless ’ management , has a strong case as all his transfers were signed off by the chief executive			1
strong case : @entity70 will have his case heard against @entity71 later in the year @entity71 point especially to the failure of £ 8m striker @entity85 , who was sold back to @entity86 for a £ 5m loss after 11 games without scoring			1
@entity85 is back among the goals			0
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * @entity91 ’s annual jolly to @entity92 for their summer meeting could be volatile , with a number of @entity96 teams furious that fines for breaching financial fair play are going to charity rather than being divided among law - abiding clubs			0
@entity102 say clubs agreed the charity element when they accepted @entity73 solidarity payments subsequent to the ballot on financial fair play			0
@entity108 ’s inside edge * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * @entity108 's inside edge @entity110 would be fortunate to be appointed full - time @entity112 coach this month , given his woeful record			1
nevertheless the interview panel of @entity108 chief executive @entity118 , cricket managing director @entity114 and @entity115 , head of elite coaching development , are likely to favour an insider			0
@entity110 has n’t shown any sign during 17 months in charge of the one - day and @entity123 sides that he is capable of improving @entity112 ’s cricketers			1
but word inside @entity115 ’s is that the @entity108 would be loath to pick a foreign coach after all the investment in national coaching programmes			0
yet someone like @entity133 ’s @entity132 coach @entity131 appears to have a lot more motivational flair than the wholly uninspiring @entity110			1
lucky : @entity112 coach @entity110 has not impressed with the @entity123 side at the recent tournament @entity138 may be fighting to avoid relegation from the championship , but standards at @entity142 are still such that the @entity144 ownership group from @entity145 were refused entry to the boardroom because they were n’t wearing ties			1
the @entity145 delegation had to go to the club shop to buy suitable neckwear before being allowed in			0
@entity152 have followed @entity154 personnel for 36 hours pre-match as part of their 36 series which will be broadcast by @entity159 on tuesday			0
it ’s no wonder the @entity73 have embraced the arrival of the @entity163 network when @entity152 boss @entity164 told club chairmen it would be a sign of success if they had to double their £ 200m rights contract in the next tender			0
screen star : @entity171 and his @entity154 team - mates are subject of a @entity152 documentary meanwhile , the fact @entity174 are screening @entity177 ’s next four games — and probably the last two as well — shows @entity178 were outmanoeuvred throughout the picks process .			0

bookmakers stunts get the thumbs down
@entity70 and @entity76 believe they have a strong case against @entity71
@entity110 remains favourite for @entity112 post despite poor @entity123 tournament
