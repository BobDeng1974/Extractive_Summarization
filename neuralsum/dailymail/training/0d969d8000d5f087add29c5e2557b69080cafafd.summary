in a 13 - year professional playing career that ended in 2003 , @entity35 did well financially for the era , playing at @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity1 among others			1
‘ my top salary as a player was around £ 15,000 per week , at @entity1 , at a time when the best - paid players were on perhaps £ 25,000 a week , ’ he told the @entity47			1
but it was his post-playing days when he really struck it rich			2
having earned single - digit millions in total as a player , he has since banked around £ 15 million from asset management ... and counting			1

‘ my second career has definitely been more risky			2
as a footballer you ’re an employee			0
‘ as a businessman you take risks			0
your investment can go up			0
or it can crash and you lose everything			0
’ he cites the 1999 @entity2 win , played on painkillers because of a stress fracture in his ankle , as a career high			1
‘ the whole day was off the dial , ’ he recalls			0
‘ painful , so painful			0
but sport is about winning and it was a brilliant occasion			0
the @entity1 fans were just fantastic			1
’ @entity35 played the 1999 @entity2 win on painkillers because of a stress fracture in his ankle his other football career highlights were winning a @entity84 in @entity85 with @entity86 in a brief stay in the 2000 - 01 season , and playing for @entity89 in a draw against hosts @entity91 at @entity31 in the opening game of @entity93			1

’ he thinks in the short - term , @entity1 have a realistic shot of glory in this weekend ’s final			1
‘ the players are finally starting to catch up with the philosophy of @entity149 , ’ he says			0
‘ of course @entity150 are strong , terrific , and @entity151 will prepare them brilliantly			2

@entity1 will go out there under less pressure			2
