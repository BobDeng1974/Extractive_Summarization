a @entity1 - winning journalist has accused president @entity2 of lying to the @entity4 people earlier this year when he blamed president @entity5 for a sarin - gas attack that killed hundreds of @entity8 civilians in august			1
@entity9 , 76 , who had previously described the official account of the 2011 raid which killed @entity12 as ‘ one big lie , ’ claims the current administration ‘ cherry - picked intelligence ’ on @entity8			1
@entity9 first gained worldwide recognition in 1969 for exposing the @entity17 and its cover - up during the @entity19 , for which he received the 1970 @entity21			0
@entity1 - winning journalist @entity9 has accused president @entity2 of lying to the @entity4 people earlier this year when he blamed president @entity5 for a sarin - gas attack that killed hundreds of @entity8 civilians in august @entity9 , 76 , cited conversations with military officials who spoke of their ' immense frustration ' with the president in early september , secretary of state @entity27 said the @entity4 had proof that the nerve - gas attack in @entity8 was made on @entity5 's orders			1
‘ we know the @entity5 regime was responsible , ’ president @entity2 told the nation in an address days after this revelation , when he said he had been pushed over the ‘ red line ’ to consider military intervention			0
in sunday 's @entity38 , @entity9 accused the administration of ‘ cherry - picked intelligence , ’ citing conversations with intelligence and military officials			1
‘ a former senior intelligence official told me that the @entity2 administration had altered the available information – in terms of its timing and sequence - to enable the president and his advisers to make intelligence retrieved days after the attack look as if it had been picked up and analyzed in real time , as the attack was happening , ’ he wrote			2
some 355 people showing ' neurotoxic symptoms ' died august 21 after the deadly sarin gas attack which @entity4 authorities accused forces loyal to president @entity5 of carrying out president @entity5 repeatedly denied that his soldiers carried out the sarin - gas attack that killed hundreds of @entity8 civilians in august according to @entity9 , the situation reminded him of the 1964 @entity64 , when president @entity66 's administration had reversed the sequence of @entity69 intercepts to justify one of their early bombings of @entity72			1
@entity9 also said that his contacts spoke of ‘ immense frustration inside the military and intelligence bureaucracy ’ regarding the current president			1
‘ the guys are throwing their hands in the air and saying , “ how can we help this guy [ @entity2 ] when he and his cronies in the @entity83 make up the intelligence as they go along ? ” ’ @entity9 also claims that the administration buried intelligence on the fundamentalist group / rebel group @entity88 related to the sarin attacks , plus he repeated his accusation that the @entity4 media fails to properly question what information is given to them by the government			1
a @entity96 resolution ultimately prevented @entity4 military intervention , but @entity9 believes that the information he has unveiled is similar to when president @entity99 justified his invasion of @entity101 with evidence concerning nuclear weapons which later turned out not to be true			2
in early september , secretary of state @entity27 said the @entity4 had proof that the nerve - gas attack in @entity8 was made on @entity5 's orders ' lying ' : @entity9 says ' not one word ' of the @entity2 administration 's account of the raid that supposedly killed @entity12 is true			1
the government has never released pictures of @entity12 's dead body to the public ' the cherry - picking was similar to the process used to justify the @entity101 war , ' wrote @entity9			2
this is n’t the first time he has accused president @entity2 of lying			0
in september he said that ‘ not one word ’ of the administration ’s narrative on the killing of @entity12 was true			0
at that time @entity9 also savaged the @entity4 media for failing to challenge the @entity83 on a whole host of issues , from @entity69 spying , to drone attacks , to aggression against @entity8			1
he said the @entity131 raid that supposedly resulted in the death of the @entity134 terror leader , @entity9 said , ‘ not one word of it is true ’			0
according to @entity9 the problem is that the @entity4 media is allowing the @entity2 administration to get away with lying			2
president @entity2 , vice president @entity140 , former secretary of state @entity141 and members of the national security team watch the raid live from the @entity83 's @entity145 on may 1 , 2011 the compound : the @entity148 home of the @entity134 leader was in flames after it was attacked by @entity131 ‘ it ’s pathetic			0
they are more than obsequious , they are afraid to pick on this guy [ @entity2 ]			0
’ @entity9 said the @entity4 press spends ‘ so much more time carrying water for @entity2 than i ever thought they would ’			0
in his opinion , the solution would be to shut down news networks like @entity161 and @entity162 and fire 90 per cent of mainstream editors and replace them with ‘ real ’ journalists who are not afraid to speak truth to power			0
‘ the republic ’s in trouble , we lie about everything , lying has become the staple , ’ he said .			0
