by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 was surprised @entity3 was not penalised by the stewards at the @entity6 @entity5 for ' destroying ' the race of @entity9 team - mate @entity8			1
@entity3 has been given support since his collision with @entity8 at @entity12 at the end of last month by @entity14 and @entity15 , both of whom claimed what unfolded was ' a racing incident '			1
of all the people to fight @entity8 's corner , @entity2 would likely be last on many people 's list given the duo had a magnetic attraction to one another during a turbulent 2011 campaign when they often clashed on track , and occasionally off it , when the @entity30 was at @entity31 and @entity32 with @entity33			1
surprise : @entity2 believes @entity3 was fortunate to escape the @entity6 gp without punishment but @entity2 feels the stewards were wrong for not looking into the lap - two collision in @entity6 which saw @entity3 puncture a tyre on @entity8 's car after clipping it with his front wing			1
@entity8 was forced to retire late on due to damage sustained to the car courtesy of his long drive back to the pits , whilst @entity3 went on to finish second to open up a 29 - point gap			1
assessing the incident , @entity47 driver @entity2 said : ' what i saw in the last race was not so correct from @entity3 , to be honest			1
' i do n't understand why they ( the stewards ) did n't give him a penalty because it was impossible to pass @entity8 at that place ( @entity56 )			2
collision course : @entity3 ( right ) collided with @entity9 team - mate @entity8 in @entity12 , picking up front wing damage but giving the @entity30 a rear puncture which wrecked his race ' he did n't brake , they touched , @entity3 was behind , so @entity3 destroyed @entity8 ' race			1
' i do n't understand why the @entity65 , the stewards , did n't give him a penalty			2
' earlier this season race stewards were informed to be more lenient in looking at incidents rather than reviewing every single indiscretion			0
@entity2 has suggested they have now gone too far the other way , adding : ' if you are the team and you have both drivers fighting for the championship , it 's fantastic for the team			0
points : @entity3 ( left ) went to to finish second to @entity79 ( centre ) while @entity8 retired from the race ' they are not fighting another team , they are going to be champions anyway , so they need to allow them to fight			2
' but for me , @entity3 should have had a penalty for what he did as he destroyed the race of another guy fighting for the championship			0
' i think maybe the stewards are losing a little bit of direction			0
they need to carry on doing what is inside the rules			0
' given @entity3 's advantage in the championship , and despite double points available at the final race in @entity101 in november , @entity2 is in no doubt as to who has the advantage			0
' @entity3 - he has more points so it 's easier for him			0
i 'd put my money on him now , ' @entity2 added .			0
