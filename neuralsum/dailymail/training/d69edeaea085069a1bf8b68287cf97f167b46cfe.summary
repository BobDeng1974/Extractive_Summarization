@entity0 is refusing to lift the lid on the @entity3 ' refuseniks ' after @entity3 captain @entity4 ordered the @entity6 boss to name and shame the players who he claimed have feigned injury to avoid international duty			1
@entity0 had told @entity11 at the weekend that when he was @entity13 boss some players had asked him to pull them out of @entity3 squads			1
the claim , however , riled @entity4 after he admitted he was ' broken ' by @entity3 's failure to get out of the group stages			1
‘ if @entity0 is making a comment like that , he should name them and embarrass them			1
no one in this group wants to go home			2
no one wants to go home			2
‘ if he ’s not naming them , i ca n’t answer that			2
if it ’s the case , it ’s disgusting			2
for me , if a player does n’t want to be , he does n’t deserve to be here at a @entity18			1
the comment is a comment , like ‘ them ’			0
‘ they ’ did n’t want to play for @entity3			2
who ? name them ? is it @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ? ‘ i do n’t know who he means			0
five years ago ? 10 years ago ? i ’ve spoken to @entity51 and he ’s devastated			0
‘ i can understand why you ’ve asked the question , with @entity0 a big coach in the game , but we need names			1
but it ’s not here			0
i can guarantee it ’s not here			0
‘ he should be embarrassed if there ’s one player			0
when you go down into the younger age groups , they ’re younger lads			0
‘ they might not want to be away from their families			0
but when you ’re picked at this level and find any excuse not to be here , you do n’t deserve to be here			0
’ upset : @entity4 says former @entity13 striker @entity51 is ' devastated ' by @entity0 's claims tough night : @entity4 and @entity74 look on dejected during @entity3 's @entity18 defeat to @entity76 doubts : @entity0 has questioned the commitment of young @entity80 players to the national team cause but @entity0 responded to @entity83 , saying : ‘ i understand @entity4 ’s concern but i do n’t want to get into naming names because it would n’t be fair to the players			1
every @entity89 manager past and present knows what i ’m talking about			1
but sadly this attitude is not unusual these days			0
you ’ve only got to look at how many players pull out of an international game on tuesday and wednesday then are running about for their clubs the next saturday to see that this is a very real issue			2
’ @entity91 also claimed it would be a major surprise if there were players involved with his squads who found excuses not to join up with the national team			1
thumbs up : @entity91 believes there has been a greater interest in playing for @entity3 during his time in charge @entity3 ’s head coach added : ' we have to make clear to players : if you want to play for @entity3 , you commit yourself for @entity3			1
‘ in the two years i ’ve been here , i ’ve seen a greater interest in playing for @entity3 , so @entity0 ’s comments come as a bit of a surprise			1
‘ if you make comments like that , you have to name them			0
i could name a player with an educated guess but players ? it ’s unfair to ask people to look back historically			2
let ’s see how it will be moving forward			0
let ’s keep our standards high			0
’ @entity0 's nephew @entity134 , meanwhile , will captain @entity3 in the final game of the @entity133 as @entity4 drops to the bench against @entity136 in @entity137 on tuesday .			1
