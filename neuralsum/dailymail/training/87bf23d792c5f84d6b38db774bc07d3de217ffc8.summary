by @entity1 reporter published : 17:49 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 17:49 est , 15 january 2014 nearly two thirds of patients seeking treatment for depression are women , @entity4 figures show			1
almost 475,000 women were referred for counselling or behavioural therapy last year , compared to only 274,000 men			1
the figures , which for the first time reveal the numbers of patients receiving the so - called ‘ talking treatments ’ , also showed women under 50 , and especially those in their 20s , are most likely to seek help			1
@entity21 : nearly two thirds of patients seeking treatment for depression are women , @entity4 figures show some experts say women are more prone to mental illness because they tend to bottle up their emotions , whereas men lash out if angry			1
but female patients are also far more likely to admit they have a problem			0
only last month , the @entity4 ’s annual health survey revealed that almost a quarter of women were depressed or very anxious			1
according to the @entity36 ’s figures , 761,848 patients were referred last year for counselling , psychological treatment or behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety			1
difference : almost 475,000 women were referred for counselling or behavioural therapy last year , compared to only 274,000 men			1
women under 50 , and especially those in their 20s , are most likely to seek help ( file picture ) some 62 per cent were women , though in some cases the gender was not recorded			1
three quarters were aged 20 to 49 , with the majority of those cases – 185,700 – in their 20s			2
because this is the first time the data has been published , it is impossible to know whether the numbers needing treatment for depression is on the rise			0
however , separate @entity4 figures show there has been a surge in prescriptions for antidepressants with 50million handed out a year , a rise of 7.5 per cent compared to the year before			1
the increase has partly been blamed on financial woes although there is also concern that patients are becoming addicted to the drugs , with gps writing out repeat prescriptions too easily			0
expert : @entity76 , chief executive of mental health charity @entity77 , said : women ' feel more able to express their feelings and look for support ' experts are divided over whether women are more susceptible to depression and anxiety or whether they are better at seeking professional help			0
@entity87 , of mental health charity @entity88 , said : ‘ while there is no gender difference in the prevalence of mental health problems , women are much more likely to seek help than men , and are more willing to talk about their own mental wellbeing			2
all the signs suggest that more and more people are seeking help for mental health problems			0
‘ prescriptions for antidepressants have been rising steadily and recently topped 50million for the first time , while the numbers of people contacting organisations like @entity88 for help are also increasing			0
‘ we also know that people are really struggling at the moment , as unemployment , cuts to welfare and other pressures take their toll on the mental health of the nation			0
‘ it ’s important that anyone struggling with their mental health speaks to their gp as soon as possible			0
’ last month the @entity4 ’s annual health survey involving 8,000 adults showed 23 per cent of women reported feeling anxious or had been diagnosed with depression			2
some experts argue that this is because women tend to want to share their feelings when they are at their lowest ebb , while men are more likely to turn to alcohol or physical violence			2
@entity76 , chief executive of mental health charity @entity77 , said : ‘ previous research indicates that depression is around twice as common among women as men , as is self - harm and suicide attempts			2
but it is young and middle - aged men who are most at risk of actually taking their own lives			0
‘ the reasons may be in part because women feel more able to express their feelings and look for support			0

almost 475,000 women were referred for counselling or therapy last year
meanwhile , only 274,000 men sought treatment , according to @entity4 figures
women under 50 , especially those in 20s , most likely to ask for help
