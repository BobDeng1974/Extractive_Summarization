' she buys them and i do n't ask			0
i just say thank you			0
i know my mum is a pushover , and i 'm not going to lie , it 's just because she 's really soft and she agrees to most stuff			0
' although @entity4 , who says she 'll spend ' whatever money i can get ' , does have a paper round to help fund her shopping addiction , it certainly is n't your average job			1
