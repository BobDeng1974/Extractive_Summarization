by @entity1 reporter published : 18:23 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 10:50 est , 2 october 2013 the battle to stop foreign invaders killing off native @entity6 wildlife is costing £ 1.7billion a year			1
among the biggest culprits are @entity9 knotweed , @entity11 grey squirrels , @entity13 zebra mussels and @entity15 ‘ killer ’ shrimp			1
@entity18 research revealed that the total bill for defending @entity6 animals and plants from the ‘ alien ’ invasion costs £ 1.7billion a year – or more than £ 25 for every person in the country			1
only humans do more harm to native biodiversity than foreign species			1
' foreign killers ' : @entity11 grey squirrels were listed among other alien invaders as dangers to @entity6 wildlife tackling @entity9 knotweed costs the economy £ 165million a year , according to figures from the @entity36			1
the most costly problem is the @entity15 rabbit , with damage to crops and measures to control it adding up to more than £ 260million a year , the @entity36 data showed			1
@entity45 ’s @entity44 said other major culprits include mink , which were imported from the @entity11 by fur farms but escaped to wreak havoc , and @entity11 signal crayfish			1
the programme highlighted how zebra mussels have so infested @entity53 in @entity53 that @entity54 has had to spend £ 500,000 to install special filters to sift them out because they spread so quickly , clogging pipes			1
@entity59 zoologist dr @entity58 explained how the mussels – which have distinctive striped shells – arrived in the @entity62 about ten years ago on the hulls of ships from @entity15			2
infected : the @entity66 site was covered in @entity9 knotweed			1
organisers spent £ 70m removing it costly : @entity45 's @entity44 claimed @entity68 would have to pay £ 25 each to remove killers like @entity13 zebra mussels they reproduce so rapidly they kill off local mussels by growing all over them , starving them of food			1
@entity53 now contains millions of zebra mussels , he said			2
‘ a single individual can produce a million offspring in a year			2
‘ they are probably the dominant organism now in this water			2
what we are finding in the @entity62 is where zebra mussels are established , native mussels are declining very rapidly			0
’ @entity86 , from @entity54 , said : ‘ every year we have to take tons of these shells away to keep the water flowing			0
’ @entity11 mink is another creature noted in the programme , which warns we need £ 1.7bn to save the wild countryfile reporter @entity94 said : ‘ from the grey squirrel , @entity11 crayfish , mink driving water voles from our river banks and the small but scarily - named “ killer shrimp ” , a whole host of animals and plants are playing their part in colonising our countryside			1
‘ luckily , of the 2,000 non-native species living among us , only a few hundred are actually harmful			0
’ the water vole – often associated with the character @entity112 in @entity112 – is @entity62 ’s fastest declining native mammal			0
in 1990 , there were seven million living on the riverbanks			0
by 1998 , there were fewer than one million and numbers are continuing to decline			0
as well as falling prey to escaped mink , they have seen changes in farming destroy their habitats			2
@entity125 , invasive species adviser at the @entity126 , said : ‘ our priority has to be tackling non-native species , because they lack natural pests and enemies			0
’ @entity9 knotweed , brought to @entity62 by @entity134 botanists as an ornamental pond plant , is one of the fastest spreading invaders			2
during building of the @entity66 in @entity140 it cost an estimated £ 70million to remove the plant and dispose of it			1
red squirrels are only just starting to increase their numbers after nearly 140 years of losing out to grey squirrels introduced from @entity146			0
@entity147 is also at risk , with warnings that the native bluebell could disappear within a decade			0
it is being squeezed out by a cross between the @entity6 bluebell and a @entity155 cousin introduced more than 300 years ago			0
some invaders even pose a health risk			0
the sap of giant hogweed can cause painful blisters and the caterpillar of the oak processionary moth can cause a fatal allergic reaction .			0

it would cost every @entity166 £ 25 each to save our wildlife from foreign ' killers '
@entity45 's @entity44 revealed @entity11 mink and crayfish are also culprits
the *government* spent £ 70m removing knotweed from the @entity66
