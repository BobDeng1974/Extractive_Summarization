by @entity0 @entity3 purists watch out , the word is that someone wants to change the rules			2
a @entity8 academic and @entity3 fan has proposed altering the value of some letters to reflect changes in the dictionary and how easy they are to play with other letters			1
dr @entity14 , who created a computer programme to recalculate the values , is likely to outrage purists by awarding just six points for a z , which is the highest scoring tile alongside @entity20 , with both worth ten points			2
he says only @entity20 should remain a ten - point tile , with x relegated from eight to five			0
the game was invented 1938 by @entity25 , who calculated the scores based on how frequently letters appeared on the front page of the @entity29			1
calls for change : a researcher claims that the letter values in @entity3 - which was invented 75 years ago - are outdated updated : researcher @entity34 has devised a new scoring system where letter values - such as z and @entity23 - have been changed to better represent how frequently they are now used in the @entity38 mr @entity14 gives the letter z as a prime example , claiming that by today 's standards it should only be worth six points instead of the traditional 10			1
he also suggests that x - worth eight points in the current game - should only be worth five points			0
but while many of the letters would decrease in value under the system devised by mr @entity14 , some letters would go up in value			2
mr @entity14 recommends that the letter @entity53 increase from one point to two points and @entity57 go from two to three			0
q , however , is still apparently a tricky word to play and should still count as 10 points , mr @entity14 adds			0
researcher @entity14 has made a new scoring system so the value of letters better represent how often they are used in the modern day @entity38			1
here is what each letter is worth in his software programme called @entity68 : a : 1 - stays the same b : 3 - stays the same @entity70 from 3 d : 2 - stays the same @entity72 the same @entity73 from 4 @entity75 from 2 @entity74 from 4 i : 1 - stays the same @entity77 from 8 @entity78 from 5 l : 2 - up from 1 @entity81 from 3 n : 1 - stays the same o : 1 - stays the same p : 2 - down from 3 @entity20 : 10 - stays the same @entity84 : 1 - stays the same s : 1 - stays the same t : 1 - stays the same @entity53 from 1 v : 5 - up from 4 @entity88 : 4 - stays the same x : 5 - down from 8 @entity90 from 4 z : 6 - down from 10 mr @entity14 told the @entity91 : ' the dictionary of legal words in @entity3 has changed			1
among the notable additions are all of these short words which make it easier to play @entity99 , q and @entity23 , so even though q and z are the highest value letters in @entity3 , they are now much easier to play			2
' mr @entity14 has devised a new software programme called @entity68 which awards points using a scoring system based on how frequently letters are used in the @entity38 language today			1
the new system takes into account the frequency of the letters in the @entity38 language , the frequency of how many times a letter appears in two , three , seven , and eight - letter words and how easy it is to play the letter with other letters			1
but mr @entity14 is far from the first to devise a new scoring system for @entity3 , which was invented in 1938 by @entity8 architect @entity25 , who calculated letter scores by measuring how frequently they appeared on the front page of the @entity29			1
the co-president of the @entity125 , @entity126 , says he hears from people at least once or twice a year saying that the tile values are incorrect			0
but he warns there would ' catastrophic outrage ' around the world if the game rules were now changed			0
he told the @entity91 : ' some people would just continue playing with the old tile distributions because people who 've played the game often enough tend to remember that the @entity20 is worth 10 points , the z is worth 10 points and so on			0
' mr @entity126 added that letters such as @entity141 and blank tiles , that while low scoring alone , are a great help in joining words and achieving multiple word scores in one go			0
but while there may be many who would relish the chance to see an end to the 10 point z , which can so often play the deciding tile in a closely - fought game of @entity3 , the makers of the game have no intentions of changing it			0
@entity159 , the @entity160 representative for @entity3 makers @entity161 , said : ' @entity161 has no plans to change @entity164 tiles			1
it is not a game where fairness is paramount , it is a game of luck and changing the tile values would n't achieve anything			0
' mr @entity14 admitted that his new way of scoring , while making the game fairer , may not suit everyone			2
he said : ' that might be desirable in tournaments but it might not be as good in casual play where you want the less skilled players to have a shot periodically at beating the more highly skilled players			0
' traditionalists need not panic : the makers of @entity3 , @entity161 , say they have no plans to make any changes to the game			1

board game was invented 75 years ago by @entity8 architect @entity25
he scored letters depending on their level of use in the @entity29
some claim values are outdated because of changes to the @entity38 language
@entity8 researcher @entity14 has created new ' fairer ' letter scores
but @entity3 maker @entity161 says it has no plans to make changes to the game
