scrapped : a collection about @entity1 is to be taken down at @entity2 the new chief executive of a museum dedicated to the @entity6 code - breakers has sparked anger after announcing plans to remove @entity1 memorabilia			1
@entity10 said having a collection about the wartime prime minister was ' not synonymous ' with @entity2 , in @entity13 , and likened it to having ' @entity16 and @entity17 mugs in someone 's house '			1
the trustees plan to take down the collection of pictures , posters , books , pamphlets and busts because they are not see as relevant			0
@entity1 once described the code - breakers who cracked the @entity30 's @entity29 as ' the geese that laid the golden eggs - but never cackled			1
' according to the museum 's website , the privately - owned collection has many rare and interesting pieces and fascinating stories that enthrall visiting pupils			2
the displays chronologically illustrate events and episodes in @entity1 ’s life			0
a selection of @entity1 ’s broadcast speeches is also available for students to hear			0
examples of his literary works and reproductions of his paintings can be seen , and the displays span from his birth in 1874 through to his schooling , military career , political life , premiership , his likes and leisure pursuits , and finally his state funeral			0
vital : @entity2 played a crucial role in ensuring an @entity63 victory in @entity6 students are also allowed to ring the bell of @entity67 , the launch used to carry sir @entity1 ’s coffin up the river @entity69			1
historian @entity71 , of @entity72 's , @entity73 , said the exhibition must be protected and remain accessible to the public			0
she told the @entity76 : ' this shows that history needs more funding so people are not put in the position of choosing one thing over another			0
' historic : wrens working on the enigma code - breaking operation in @entity2 getting the message : one of @entity2 's computing machines in action during @entity6 instead , the @entity1 exhibition will be replaced with stories of the people who worked at the intelligence - gathering station near @entity94 during the war			1
mr @entity10 said the @entity96 was not museum - standard but just ' one man 's obsession '			2
it is feared other displays such as the @entity103 exhibition could also be scrapped following a £ 7.5million restoration of the site			0
the code - breakers wrote to @entity1 in 1941 pleading for more resources			1
the prime minister ordered immediate action to make sure they had everything needed to carry out their vital work			1
father of the modern computer @entity116 who led the team of enigma code - breakers at @entity2 but mr @entity10 said : ' @entity2 is moving into a very exciting period in its development as we begin to undertake a partly publicly funded major restoration project which will start the process of turning the @entity2 into a national , and in time we hope world class , heritage attraction			1
' part of this process involves working towards achieving national museum accreditation and as such we no longer have the space or are in the position to play host to a number of privately owned collections which are not focused on the @entity6 code - breaking story			1
' as a result we have reviewed the terms on which a number of such collections occupy space in the @entity2 and have recently written to all outlining the specific conditions pertinent to each			2
' @entity1 ’s unerring support for @entity2 and the value of signals intelligence during @entity6 , were clearly vital to the success of the operation			2
' however , an individual ’s collection of @entity1 memorabilia does not tell this story			0
' in short this is an interesting and exciting time for the @entity153 , but with such developments as we are currently undergoing , there will inevitably be change			0
' this may not please everyone , but the @entity159 are clear that what we are doing at the moment is necessary and important for the long - term future of the @entity2			2
' during the war @entity2 housed the government 's secret code and @entity166 , which obtained signals intelligence by breaking high - level encrypted enemy communications			2
it was also home to the colossus machine , the first programmable electronic computer			0
the @entity171 and the @entity172 , an an electromechanical device designed by @entity175 mathematician and computer scientist @entity116 , were used to break codes created by the @entity30 @entity29 encryption and decryption machine , which is also on display at @entity2			2
the importance of the code - breaking operations at @entity2 can not be underestimated			1
they produced vital intelligence that played a huge part in swinging the war in the @entity63 ’ favour			1
by 1944 @entity188 and @entity189 commanders knew the location of 58 out of 60 @entity30 divisions across the @entity192			0
in addition , a great deal of information was decrypted about general @entity198 ’s @entity197 forces in @entity199			0
the @entity30 commander enjoyed a great deal of success against the @entity188 but with the help of intelligence from the code - breakers general @entity204 's @entity188 forces were able to drive him back in 1942			1
discussions with the owners of all the other private collections on the @entity2 site are ongoing .			0
