@entity0 says she was left ' wanting to cry ' after she was bombarded with abuse for speaking out in favour of free speech			1
the celebrated academic joined other campaigners in calling on universities not to ban speakers perceived to be hostile to transgender people			2
but just hours after a letter - signed by @entity9 and many others including gay rights campaigner @entity11 - was published , she faced a torrent of abuse on @entity14			1
@entity0 and @entity11 suffered a barrage of abuse after signing a letter calling on universities to allow speakers perceived to be ' transphobic ' to appear before students in the interests of free speech the original letter claimed it was ' illiberal and undemocratic ' for universities to ban lecturers and academics deemed ' transphobic ' , meaning prejudiced against transsexual people			1
but the letter sparked an angry backlash from some in the transgender community and professor @entity0 was later branded an ' unrepentant bigot ' and mr @entity11 was called a ' parasite '			1
professor @entity0 , 60 , later told on her blog how the relentless abuse had caused her difficulty sleeping			2
she wrote : ' for two days i have been bombarded by tweets ( and a few emails )			0
' some tweeters have been very polite in their disagreement ; for which , thank you			0
others not quite so ( i should be clear , though , there have been no threats of violence )			2
' i got 60 tweets in the space of about an hour from one person alone			0
' mr @entity11 said the attacks were particularly hurtful coming after his history of protesting against prejudice professor @entity0 added : ' last night i went to bed wanting to weep ... it was n't the force of any remark , it was the relentless pummelling of attack on the basis of extraordinary loaded , sometimes quite wrong , readings of the letter			1
' cumulative harassment is what it felt like , though i am sure it was n't meant that way			0
' mr @entity11 , 63 , said he has received more than 5,000 messages attacking him since the letter was published , some of which , he said , were threatening			1
he told the @entity70 : ' on saturday night , after the first attacks started , i could n't sleep			0
i was so upset about being misrepresented as an anti-trans bigot			0
' i woke up exhausted , and on my way to a @entity75 conference , i tripped on the pavement , hit my head and suffered concussion , which i 'm still feeling today			0
