@entity1 ’s killer @entity0 will appeal his murder conviction in a hearing next month			1
however , the attorney general will also appeal @entity6 ’s sentence at that time , arguing that 20 years non-parole is ‘ manifestly inadequate ’ for @entity6 ’s crime , which could see the 45 - year - old ’s prison time extended			1
in march , @entity6 was found guilty of murder , indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse , after abusing and killing @entity15 in an abandoned house after abducting the teen from a @entity19 bus stop			1
a covert police operation culminated in @entity6 ’s arrest in august 2011 , after @entity6 unknowingly confessed to @entity15 ’s murder on camera to an undercover detective			1
@entity6 ’s defence will now claim that showing his video confession was illegal , with @entity6 ’s lawyer arguing ‘ they should never have been played to the jury ’			1
the defence is reliant on a @entity50 precedent , which saw a convicted murderer re-trialled after the jury was shown his confession video in the @entity55 trial			1
‘ really the centre - point of the whole argument is the admissions that @entity0 made to the undercover officers should never have seen the light of day , ’ @entity6 ’s lawyer , @entity56 told @entity57			1
‘ if that evidence is out , the case against @entity0 becomes particularly weak			0
’ mr @entity56 says that @entity6 , currently in isolation at maximum security prison @entity66 , is in good spirits due to his upcoming appeal			1
‘ he ’s very happy that he ’s got a date , he ’s very keen for the appeal to run			0
’ ‘ it could change his life incredibly if he got a retrial			0
the high fences and tough security that keeps high - profile inmates , such as @entity6 , locked behind the @entity78 the first images from inside @entity6 's cell - complete with a toilet , shower and bed how @entity0 looked - a frail and gaunt figure - before he was locked away in @entity78 @entity15 ’s parents , @entity35 and @entity86 , desperately searched for their son for almost eight years before @entity6 ’s arrest			1
they are not concerned , telling @entity57 that they were prepared for @entity6 to appeal his conviction			2
‘ to be honest , we ’re quite comfortable with the appeal process , we knew it was always going to happen , ’ said @entity86			2
they are also not concerned with the precedent at the @entity50 @entity55 , maintaining that international rulings ‘ bear no relevance ’ on proceedings in @entity99			0
the @entity100 are preparing for the 10th annual day for @entity15 on friday , a day held to raise awareness about child safety and educating children so they know how to protect themselves			2
@entity15 's parents @entity36 and @entity35 are comfortable with the appeal process as they ' always knew it was going to happen ' cheeky boys : @entity110 ( left ) and twin brother @entity15 as young boys			1
in 2003 at the age of 13 , @entity15 , was abducted and murdered although his family did not know what had happened to him until his remains were uncovered in 2011 after a long police investigation and the family was able to lay him to rest			2
@entity37 said of his twin this year , there had not been a day since that he had n't thought of him when @entity6 was imprisoned , he had special food requests such as @entity121 rejected , but in his cell he has his own tv , radio , toilet and shower			0
he will be kept in solitary confinement during his time inside purely for his own protection from prison inmates			0
in some cases , according to prison staff , @entity6 requires high level escorts when he leaves his cell to guard him down the halls during weekly visits to the doctor			0
he visits a gym , a concrete room with a single sun - drenched window , which is the only time he ever gets to see life life outside			0
@entity86 said he knows @entity6 would be doing it tough , and quite frankly , did n't care much for his treatment behind bars			2
in a message to @entity6 , mr @entity86 told the father of three neither he nor his wife ' feel sorry for sorry him			0
' ' suck it up , ' he said			0
@entity36 and @entity151 speak after the first photo of @entity0 from behind bars emerged of him looking fit and healthy			0
