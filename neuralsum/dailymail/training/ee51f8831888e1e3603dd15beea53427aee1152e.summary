the remains of a 2,000 - year - old @entity2 village unearthed by archaeologists may be one of the most ' significant ' prehistoric discoveries ever made in @entity6			1
the @entity8 site was first discovered back in 2005 , when developers began excavation at what had been a parking lot			2
since then they have uncovered eight circles of holes in the limestone bedrock where supports for huts may once have stood			0
site of historical importance : archaeologists have discovered eight large uniformly carved circle holes in limestone in downtown @entity23 , which are believed to be the foundation holes for @entity26 dwellings dating as far back as 2,000 years archaeologist @entity27 said : ' what ’s unusual and unique about the site is that it ’s this huge chunk of land where a major part of this ancient @entity8 village site is preserved			1
' it ’s one of the earliest urban town plans in eastern @entity6			1
you can actually see this extraordinary configuration of these buildings and structures			0
’ but the discovery of the village , situated where downtown @entity23 meets @entity44 , has thrown a wrench into a multibillion - dollar development project by the @entity23 - based @entity47			1
the ancient site sits in the heart of @entity23 's latest real estate boom surrounded by luxury condo towers with names like @entity53 and @entity54			1
across the street is a luxury @entity58 hotel , where professional basketball players stay when in town to play the @entity61 , as well as some of @entity23 's newest high - end restaurants , where celebrities are spotted nightly			1
archaeologists believe the sit may be one of the earliest urban towns ever discovered in @entity6 ' birthplace of @entity23 : the remains of the @entity70 , one of the first hotels to ever be built in the area in 1897 , has also been discovered on the site @entity47 's plans for the site of the newly discovered @entity8 circles include a movie theater , restaurants and a 34 - story hotel covering an entire city block , including the archaeological site			1
the tower is part of the four - phase @entity86 @entity23 project , which includes the already completed @entity58 , an office building anchored by @entity88 and a 447 - unit condo tower overlooking @entity44			1
but this discovery may put a stop to the plans as the city of @entity23 is under pressure to revisit permits issued to the developer in hopes changing the design to preserve the ancient village			1
over the past nine years archaeologists have uncovered thousands of artifacts - as well as human bones - that show the @entity26 conducted trade with other parts of @entity6 and the @entity106			1
preservationists claim there is growing support for the site to be saved and turned into an exhibit the @entity47 plans to build movie theaters , restaurants , and a 34 - story story on the site - but archaeological discoveries in the area may prevent it from going ahead ' accounts by @entity120 ( explorers ) describe huts , a heathen , savage people			1
the big surprise is we 're finding a very sophisticated people living in one location for a fairly long period of time , ' @entity27 said			0
archaeologists also found the foundation of the @entity70 at the site , built in 1897 by industrialist @entity132 , who is widely credited with establishing @entity23			1
badly damaged in the hurricane of 1926 , the @entity133 was demolished in 1930			0
the @entity8 tribe lived near @entity44 , in the area now known as @entity23 , and they also occupied the @entity137			2
it is believed the @entity8 tribe arrived in the @entity139 , now known as @entity23 , before the beginning of the @entity141			1
the @entity8 situated their towns and camps at the mouths of rivers and streams , on inlets from the @entity148 to inland waters , and on barrier islands and keys			2
they are also believed to have occupied @entity137			2
like the other tribes in @entity153 , the @entity8 were hunters and gatherers			0
they relied mainly on fish , shellfish , nuts , and berries for food			0
during the 1500s , @entity161 began arriving in @entity153			0
a map produced by the @entity165 cartographer @entity164 in 1630 labeled the @entity153 peninsula as ' @entity26 ' after the tribe			0
@entity161 estimations of the population of the @entity8 varied between 800 and 10,000 but the tribe had disappeared by the time @entity171 took control of @entity153 from the @entity120 in 1763			0
preservationists say there is strong and growing support for measures to save and create a major exhibit around at least some of this new archaeological site			2
the city 's @entity179 is expected to discuss the proposed development at a meeting this week , and a vote could be held later this month			2
' it ’s extremely important			0
if they gave it a name , it ’s the birthplace of @entity23 , ' said city preservation board member @entity189			2
the developers have proposed carving out a slab of the limestone holding one or two of the larger circles on the site and displaying it once the building is complete			2
the @entity179 could recommend that the city take back the property			0
in a statement , the developer said that would be a mistake			0
' the cost to us of a full or partial taking of this property is far greater than the public would ever be willing to spend , ' @entity204 said			0
' imposing such a staggering burden on a single company is neither lawful nor acceptable , ' it added			0
a similar circle of holes drilled into the rock , called the @entity216 , was uncovered nearby in 1998 and is thought to have once been a ceremonial @entity26 meeting place for the native @entity219 tribe			0
that discovery led to a developer being forced to sell the land back to the city			1
the site is now a city park			0
@entity23 's @entity226 could hold a vote on the future of the site later this month			1

ancient @entity231 is believed to be at least 2,000 - years - old
archaeologists believe it may be one of the earliest towns in @entity6
foundations of the 1897 @entity70 have also been found at the site
the hotel was built by @entity132 who 's credited with establishing @entity23
the discovery has led to the site being *dubbed* ' the birthplace of @entity23 '
its historical importance may prevent a multibillion - dollar development project from going ahead on the site
