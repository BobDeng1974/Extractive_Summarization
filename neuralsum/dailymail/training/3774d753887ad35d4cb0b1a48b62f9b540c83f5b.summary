by @entity0 model and fashion muse @entity1 has both beauty and a business brain			1
the 30 - year - old 's debut make - up collection for @entity9 completely sold out in @entity10 on launch day and the store was on the brink of closing because @entity14 drew in such a big crowd			1
the fashionista , who has won three @entity17 and was even dubbed ' beautiful ' and a ' phenomenon ' by @entity19 and @entity20 , could n't be happier with her successful foray into beauty			2

beauty and brains : @entity1 , posing in a @entity32 dress , @entity34 shoes and @entity36 necklace , has seen her debut collection for @entity9 sell out in @entity10 ' people travelled from as far as @entity39 to have the chance to meet with @entity14			1
' in her new role as creative consultant at @entity9 , @entity14 has used her beauty know - how , as well as her illustrative and photographic talents , to custom - design the first in a line of limited edition sets			1
the star has created a thick nib eyeliner and a mascara so that beauty aficionados can re-create her signature cat flick eyes			2

' i do the outside flick first , just one line , then see if they 're even and level then i 'll just draw the rest in to match it but sometimes i do it too thick and have to start again ; i am obsessed with perfecting it			0
my record time is about a minute and half on a good day , ' she said			0
@entity14 hopes her new products , which have quirky names - such as the ' eye do ' liquid eyeliner - will help her fans emulate her look			1
speaking about her eyeliner , she said : ' the nib is the perfect shape and size to give you control			0
it gives you the precision to draw on the perfect cat eye			0
' it ’s pitch black and waterproof so it does n’t move even on the waterline			0
i love that it enhances my lashes each time i use it			0
' beauty secrets : it girl @entity1 shared her tips for achieving the perfect feline flick with @entity99 beauty queen : the tv presenter and all - round fashionista was speaking at the launch of her cosmetics line with indie brand @entity9 quirky : @entity14 has created the eye make - up and the packaging herself and it comes complete with kooky sketches brains behind the brand : established in 1999 , @entity9 was devised by make - up veterans and partners @entity115 and @entity116 ( pictured here with newest recruit , @entity14 ) @entity1 for @entity9 will cost £ 35 per set and is available on eyeko.com and at @entity119 desperate to emulate @entity14 's signature cat flick eyeliner and smokey eyed look , @entity99 writer @entity0 put her new range to the test ... ' a lot of girls want to look like @entity14 , she has that " just rolled out of bed " indie girl style so when she unveiled her debut make - up range , we were keen to give it a spin			1
the mascara is good , very thick and lasts all day and it 's good to know that it 's helping to condition your lashes whilst you wear it			0
it 's pretty tough to get off though , we recommend using a gentle eye make - up remover like @entity141 's @entity140 remover as it can be quite stubborn			1
as for the eyeliner , if you have the knack for applying it , it looks great			0
however , it is very , very black so may be too heavy on some fair - haired ladies			2
the packaging is what wins us over and would be great as a @entity152 stocking filler			0

model , 30 , saw her debut make - up collection sell out
@entity10 nearly had to be shut down *due* to crowds
