music blared from the purple bus , and @entity3 fan @entity2 stood with drink in hand amid her usual tailgate buddies while making a bold fashion statement : a black , rhinestone - decorated jersey with the white no 27			1
' there 's two sides to every story , ' said @entity2 , a 23 - year - old waitress from @entity3			2
' i saw the video			2
that 's their personal business , and it should n't have affected his career			2
i do n't agree with domestic violence , but she 's still with him , so obviously it was n't that big of a deal			2
everyone should just drop it			0
' @entity3 fans male and female , young and old , arrived for thursday night 's game against the @entity32 debating the events that have affected their team over the last few days			1
their once beloved running back has been kicked off the team and indefinitely banned by the @entity37 after a video surfaced that showed him punching his then - fiancee - and now wife - inside an @entity41 hotel elevator			1
@entity2 wears a @entity11 jersey before the @entity3 ' game against the @entity32 all condemned @entity11 's actions , but there was little consensus as to what his punishment should be			1
the @entity37 did the right thing by suspending him , some said , but the @entity3 should n't have terminated his contract as well			1
or maybe the suspension should have remained at two games , where it stood before the latest video became public			0
meanwhile , those who wore @entity11 jerseys were getting heckles and high - fives			1
' you support a wife - beater ! ' one female fan yelled at male fan wearing a no. 27 about 90 minutes before kickoff			2
outside of at least one entrance , a memo explained the @entity70 policy , aimed at " particularly families , women and children " who wish to exchange a @entity11 jersey for that of another @entity3 player			1
the @entity3 are no longer selling @entity11 jerseys , but at least one independent vendor had some @entity11 action figurines on sale next to his collection of vintage @entity83 wares			1
@entity84 wears a @entity3 ' @entity11 jersey as she tailgates before the game @entity87 , 65 , put two pieces of duct tape over the letters ' @entity90 ' on the back of his faded shirt so that it read ' @entity95 ' instead of " @entity11			1
" but the tape kept falling off , so he took off the jersey , then put it back on without the tape while uttering , ' ah , i might as well			0
' ' everybody deserves a second chance , ' he said , a refrain heard often in the parking lot			0
this , after all , is the franchise of @entity105 , who was charged in a murder case in 2000 but now has a statue outside the stadium			0
his no 52 remains arguably the most visible jersey among tailgaters			0
but there were plenty of @entity114 , and many of them said they were deliberately making a statement			0
' i took the bus here , so people were , like , " good , i 'm glad to see to someone out here showing support , ' said @entity118 , 18 , as he learned against the barrier by the players ' entrance			0
@entity11 has been indefinitely banned by the @entity37 after the shocking footage was released by @entity129 on monday ' but i 've also seen a lot of people giving me dirty looks and people saying stuff to me like , ` i ca n't believe you 'd wear that			1
do n't you know what he did ? ' ' yeah , i 'm pretty aware of what he did			0
and , yes , it was awful and it was definitely a mistake on his part , but he deserves a second chance			0
... people have done so much worse in this league			0

@entity3 fans - men and women - wore the now *vacant* no 27 shirt
@entity11 was indefinitely banned by the @entity37 after shocking footage was released of him striking his then fiancee in a casino lift
