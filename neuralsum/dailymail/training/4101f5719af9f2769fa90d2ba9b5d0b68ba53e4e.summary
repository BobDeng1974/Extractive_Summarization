by @entity0 former @entity2 winner @entity1 produced a brilliant finish to take command of the inaugural made in @entity7 event at the halfway stage on friday			1
@entity1 has won twice on the @entity9 - he shot a round of 60 on his way to victory in @entity13 in 2003 - and partnered @entity14 to victory for @entity16 in 2005 , but has been hampered by illness and injury recently			1
the 41 - year - old is playing on a medical exemption this season , but added a 68 to his opening 66 at @entity22 thanks to four birdies in his last six holes			2
enter the dragon : @entity26 @entity1 leads the made in @entity7 event after two rounds at eight under par , @entity1 led by four shots from @entity31 's @entity30 , with @entity33 pair @entity32 and @entity34 another shot back alongside @entity37 's @entity36 and former amateur champion @entity38			1
@entity32 was frustrated at following his opening 66 with a 73 , the 43 - year - old feeling players did not have enough notice of play resuming after a one - hour delay caused by the threat of lightning			1
' it was down to fatigue a little bit , playing seven out of eight weeks , ' said @entity32 , who is looking to make certain of his @entity48 place on home soil			1
' the brain was n't quite with it today			2
you have to just take it for what it is			2
i 'm still in the golf tournament and i have to work from here			1
' the delay should n't affect you , ( but ) i thought we were a bit quick to come back on though			1
you are sitting in the players ' lounge and you get half an hour to restart and you are on the eighth tee , which is in a different county in this resort			2
@entity66 back the years : @entity1 has not won @entity9 event since 2005 ' i thought it was a bit quick so we got stressed about that			1
i had a bad drive on nine , but it was mostly down to putting today , which you ca n't blame that on the delay			2
you need to hole putts to be in contention and i could n't do that today			0
if i can get it working and stay patient then it is still a good opportunity			0
' @entity30 is ranked 611th in the world and has yet to win a @entity9 title in 333 attempts , but the 40 - year - old carded a second round of 67 as playing partner and world number 1,160 @entity38 returned a 68			1
' i was on holiday last week and on sunday i tinkered with the driver , which was silly as it is probably the strongest club in my bag , ' said @entity30 , who lost his card at the end of last season , but regained it via the qualifying school			1
' i changed the settings on it and on the 15th tee on thursday i realised the settings were wrong , so when i got in i changed it and obviously drove it a lot better today			0
testing times : @entity32 was frustrated after hitting a 73 as he chases a @entity48 place ' i feel like i 've played well this season			1
i missed ( the cut ) in @entity113 by one , @entity114 ( @entity115 ) by one and the others by three			0
so i feel like my game is there			0
the last two weeks off were what i needed to recharge the batteries			0
' massive crowds followed @entity34 's group in the morning before switching their attention to @entity32 and the home players appreciated the excellent support			1
' it 's like playing a major championship out here , i 've never seen anything like it , ' @entity34 said			1
' it 's just incredible and gave me a big boost			1
i just tried to keep on going and it was a great feeling to be out there in front of those crowds			0
' before the tournament i definitely felt a bit more pressure , but i try to deal with it in the best way and play my best golf			2
you feel pressure , but you also get that extra boost and confidence			0
' try and try again : @entity31 @entity30 has not won a @entity9 event in 333 attempts @entity1 said : ' i managed to play the back nine quite well and a birdie on the last is always nice			1
i 'm delighted with the way i played			0
the wind was n't quite as strong and in a slightly different direction and luckily i managed to make some putts			0
the chip in on 16 was nice and i think i took the chances when i had them			0
' if someone had said i 'll give you a four - shot lead after 36 holes you would take it			2
we 're halfway through the tournament and i 've been in similar positions to this before			1
i know a lot can happen and i 've got to play really well over the weekend			0
' there are some really good players chasing me so i have to keep playing the way i have been and convert the chances i get			0
local lad : @entity34 claims home crowds made it feel like playing in a major ' i feel as though the @entity9 events i 'm playing in this year are like majors to me , with my situation			1
i know that when i come out here i have to play well and perform			0
i do n't know if that is added pressure , but it is certainly added motivation			0
' i feel very motivated when i come out and play and i 'm looking forward to this weekend			0
it will be a challenge			0
hopefully i will play five out of six ( events ) coming up and if i can have a good weekend it will certainly help my cause			2
