' @entity0 ’s brazen actions in targeting and deceiving elderly and vulnerable patients whilst in the process of receiving medical care were particularly callous acts on her part - the impact this sort of offence can have on the victims and their families can not be underestimated			2
' i hope that the custodial sentence given to @entity0 today acts as a deterrent to anyone considering preying on the vulnerable in such a cold and calculated manner and also illustrates the seriousness of these crimes			0
