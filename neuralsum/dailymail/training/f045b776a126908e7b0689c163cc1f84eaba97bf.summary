by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:41 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 05:19 est , 13 september 2013 voters still blame @entity4 for the need to cut public spending , three and a half years after the party was dumped from power , new research reveals			1
in a blow for @entity11 ’s strategy of attacking the coalition ’s austerity programme , more than one in three people say the cuts are his party ’s fault as it continues to be haunted by the infamous note left in the @entity20 admitting ' there is no money '			1
a state of the nation study released with barely a year and half before the next election also shows 31 per cent of people think the @entity27 will handle the economy best			1
the study by pollsters @entity29 examines public opinion since the general election in 2010 and looks ahead to the big issues for the 2015 polling day			1
it shows that the economy remains the major political battleground , with 67 per cent naming it as the most important issue facing the country			2
however , only a minority of voters persuaded by mr @entity11 ’s attacks on the current government , @entity29 says the party battle over the economy is a contest between two narratives : ‘ the tough decisions have been taken and now the economy is on the mend ’ versus ‘ living standards have fallen since 2010 and , for most people , show no signs of reviving ’			2
@entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 have struck a more upbeat tone in recent days about the recovery gaining momentum			0
chancellor mr @entity56 said the economy was ' turning a corner ' while mr @entity57 ' a dawn appears to be breaking '			0
@entity65 governor @entity64 told @entity66 today : ' our job is to make sure that that 's not another false dawn , and ensure that this economy reaches , as soon as possible , a speed of escape velocity , so that it can sustain higher interest rates			0
' just over half of people ( 53 per cent ) claim immigration is the most important issue , followed by 30 per cent for welfare , 29 per cent who said health and 17 per cent said housing			2
since the election in 2010 , the proportion of people who blame @entity4 for spending cuts has fallen from 48 per cent to 36 per cent			1
but it is still well above the 25 per cent who blame the coalition , which has only risen slightly since the 17 per cent when the government was first formed			2
when @entity4 lost power in 2010 , chief secretary to the treasury @entity91 wrote a note to his successor , @entity95 , admitting : ' i 'm afraid there is no money			0
' @entity4 have struggled to live the blunt admission down , even three and a half years later			0
since the start of this year , the @entity27 have gradually built their lead over @entity4 on the economy			1
the @entity103 are considered ‘ best to handle the economy ’ by 31 per cent of people , compared with 25 per cent who said @entity4 and just four per cent who named the @entity107			1
however , with the economic recovery still in its early stages , one in five ( 21 per cent ) said they ‘ do n’t know ’ who is best placed to be put in charge of the nation ’s finances			0
despite the poor economic reputation , @entity4 remains ahead in the polls for who people would vote for at the election on 38 per cent , with @entity27 on 32 per cent			1
@entity29 said : ‘ @entity4 ’s 6 per cent lead is enough to make @entity11 prime minister – but may not be enough for him to lead a majority @entity124			0
‘ when we take all factors into account , including the incumbency “ bonus ” likely to be enjoyed by conservative mps newly elected in 2010 , @entity4 and the @entity103 both need around a 7 per cent lead in order to secure an overall majority in 2015			0

36 *%* of voters say the spending cuts are the fault of the @entity4
only 1 in 4 blame the coalition , with the @entity27 ahead on the economy
state of the nation study shows immigration and welfare also top concerns
