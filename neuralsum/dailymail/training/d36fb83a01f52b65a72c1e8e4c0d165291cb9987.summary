did she or did n’t she ? will she or wo n’t she ? has she or has n’t she ? and most pertinent of all , most damnably crucial of all , is she or is she not guilty ? on wednesday night , as the last episode in the second series of @entity7 ’s police corruption drama @entity5 is shown , millions of television viewers will finally find out the truth about the mysterious detective inspector @entity9			1
is the beleaguered cop , so brilliantly played by @entity11 , really a force for good ; an honourable and decent woman trying to do her best in a quagmire of police corruption ? millions of viewers will finally find out the truth about the mysterious detective inspector @entity9 played by @entity11 or is she just another crazy bunny boiler seeking revenge on the senior officer with whom she had an affair ? the question has certainly set the deerstalkers a-twirling on the heads of the armchair sherlocks at home , desperately trying to work out @entity30 ’s innocence — or otherwise			1
and after five 60 - minute episodes of the most tightly - plotted and nerve - shredding drama seen on @entity35 television in years , we still do n’t have a clue			2
as the bodies continue to pile up , @entity5 has been the most talked - about cop show since last year ’s @entity39 on @entity40 ( the story of a child killed in a @entity44 seaside town ) — and no wonder			1
detective sergeant @entity46 played by @entity47 ( left ) and detective constable @entity48 played by @entity49 ( right ) television critics and fans alike are showering @entity5 with praise , most describing it as the best television series of the year so far , some even calling it the best police drama ever made			1
certainly , this taut , nasty , unpredictable whodunit proves that the @entity7 — when it puts its mind to it — can make big , powerful , smash - hit dramas that are just as good as anything produced by @entity64 companies , with their limitless budgets , resources and deployment of @entity69 talent			2
deputy chief constable @entity70 played by @entity71 written by @entity73 ( his previous work includes medical drama @entity75 ) and blessed with a flawless cast , the show has lured viewers into a world of police - on - police murder which is often genuinely shocking , quietly horrifying and deeply thought - provoking			1
corpses have their fingerprints burned off to avoid identification , while rivalries between police departments in the same force threaten to bury justice in a welter of internecine politicking			1
@entity92 in @entity93 last year , @entity5 is set within a fictitious @entity95 force , but @entity73 used ( anonymous ) serving police officers as consultants			1
the result is an authentic atmosphere and a series which depicts the complicated realities of modern police work with an unflinching eye			2
at a time when the real - life @entity105 are once more under fire and facing allegations of rogue operations and corruption ( in the investigation into the murder of black teenager @entity113 and others ) , here is a cop show not afraid to sizzle with intelligence and the unmistakeable imprimatur of red hot realism			1
it reflects a world in which the dividing line between righteousness and evil , between the goodies and the baddies , has never been so mutable			2
twenty - five years after the @entity132 disaster , questions about police conduct and the subsequent cover - up of events on that day are still being asked			1
and then there was so - called @entity134 , after which it emerged that a serving officer lied about an altercation with the government chief whip at the gates of @entity141			1
superintendent @entity142 ( @entity143 ) , detective sergeant @entity46 ( @entity47 ) and detective constable @entity48 ( @entity49 ) the moral ambiguity of the force and the question of who can and who can not be trusted , in or out of uniform , has never been more pertinent			1
over the past five tension - ratcheting weeks , @entity30 has been the prime suspect in an intricate web of crime			2
the central mystery is who plotted an ambush on a police convoy , killing the protected witness they were transporting to safety and the three officers accompanying him			1
since then , there have been two more police deaths ; one detective was thrown through the window of a hospital , another was battered with a monkey wrench			1
@entity30 has been arrested on suspicion of murder and while in prison , had her hands crushed and then scalded with boiling water linked to all this is the murder of a teenage runaway and the fact that @entity177 once had an affair with the big boss , assistant chief constable @entity179 ( played by @entity71 who is also superb , with very emotive nostrils )			0
so far , so very , very bleak			0
as the quest for justice lurches on , piano - playing @entity30 has been arrested on suspicion of murder and while in prison , had her hands crushed and then scalded with boiling water			1
she has also had her head shoved down a toilet ( by the cops in her own station ) and had excrement smuggled into her prison porridge			0
hardly a glamorous role for 38 - year - old @entity11 , known for her natural gloss and polished performances in series such as @entity198 and @entity199			2
here , she is dowdy to the point of despair ; a woman who cuts her own fringe , wears yesterday ’s mascara and throws on clothes that appear to be made of cast - off potato sacks			2
it goes without saying that she is a peerless detective , possessed of ratlike cunning and strong survival instincts			0
indeed , not since @entity212 first played dci @entity213 back in @entity213 in the early @entity215 has such a fascinating and complex female police officer been created for television			0
left to right : detective sergeant @entity218 played by @entity219 and detective inspector @entity9 played by @entity11 yes , @entity39 had the wonderful @entity221 ( @entity222 ) , while @entity223 continue to ply their trade on @entity40			1
in recent years , however , it is @entity227 dramas which have led the way in creating iconoclastic , mould - breaking policewomen such as @entity230 and her woolly jumpers in @entity230 and the alarmingly direct @entity232 in @entity232			0
now it is @entity30 , beaten up but not beaten , who is more than a match for all these top she - cops			0
with only the tiniest emotion occasionally washing across her bare face , she gives nothing away			0
behind the thin blue line , who is guilty and who is innocent ? as internet chat - rooms boil with speculation and more than three million @entity7 viewers have their own theories , it is interesting that no @entity5 character , within the anti-corruption squad or out of it , is wholly good or bad			1
each and every officer is tainted in some way , although some are more crippled by their flaws than others			0
@entity30 has money worries , a difficult past and a tendency towards violence			0
‘ people have underestimated me my whole life , ’ she tells dc @entity48 ( @entity49 ) before punching her in the stomach			0
a car in a police convoy is set alight by a masked person in the @entity5 which comes to an end this week @entity48 was having an affair with the husband of the policewoman killed in the ambush , a fact known to colleague ds @entity46 ( @entity47 ) who sleeps with every attractive female in sight			1
superintendent @entity142 ( @entity143 ) also has money worries and a broken marriage			0
promised a promotion by @entity70 , he has been reluctant to explore avenues in the investigation that might clear @entity177 and implicate his protector within the force			0
viewers have lapped up all this moral ambiguity — not to mention the excellent writing , terrific acting and a complicated plotline that does not treat them like idiots			0
last week , the questioning under caution of @entity294 by anti-corruption officers @entity46 and @entity48 went on for nearly 18 minutes of heart - stopping drama			2
cocky and threatening at first , @entity70 ’s nostrils went into terrifying overdrive as the evidence mounted up			0
out on bail and back in her empty flat , the faintest spectre of a smirk flitted across @entity30 ’s face as she watched a report of @entity70 ’s arrest on the news			0
earlier she had forced a confession out of a detective by crushing him against a wall with a car			0
bunny boiler or brilliant bobby ? we ’ll have to wait until wednesday to find out .			0
