@entity0 has criticised the tactical ineffectiveness of @entity2 and @entity3 at the @entity4 in @entity5			1
@entity2 's @entity6 and @entity3 's @entity7 both crashed out in the group stages , and @entity0 admitted that he could not understand the manager 's decisions when losing matches			1
speaking to @entity12 for his new book ' winners : and how they succeed ' , the @entity16 boss said of @entity6 : @entity2 looks on , hands on hips , as @entity6 struggle at the @entity5 @entity4 in june 2014 @entity21 scored twice for @entity22 to resign @entity6 to defeat in @entity23 in their second @entity25 match @entity21 spreads his arms in celebration - and @entity0 admits he would have treated the game differently ' they are losing [ to @entity22 in their second group match ] and , if they lose , they are out of the tournament , so they have to score			1
they made two changes at 1 - 0 down			0
but when @entity2 made these changes — [ @entity36 ] @entity35 out , [ @entity37 ] @entity38 in , then [ @entity39 ] @entity40 in for [ @entity42 ] @entity41 — i could n't see a strategic change			2
same tactical model , same system			2
' ' you are losing 1 - 0 , you need to get a draw at least , so i say take one defender off and play three at the back , put an extra man to midfield / attack			0
' so maybe take off [ @entity54 ] @entity53 and play [ @entity57 ] @entity56 sweeper , [ @entity59 ] @entity58 and [ @entity61 ] @entity60 marking one each , an extra man to midfield or attack			0
then @entity22 have to adapt			0
' the @entity16 boss ( centre ) has criticised the way @entity2 did n't change his tactics against @entity22 some @entity6 fans felt the same as @entity0 - that @entity2 had n't done enough tactically @entity0 also stuck the boot in to @entity3 - the @entity7 manager who also saw his side crash out @entity0 's in - depth analysis of @entity6 will haunt fans who wanted him in charge in 2007 , when he came close to accepting the role before his wife told him to turn it down ' because he 'd be bored '			1
the now - @entity16 manager , who has guided his team to top of the @entity80 , then turned his attentions away from analysing @entity6 , instead focusing on @entity7 , whose @entity4 exploits were equally as bad as the @entity6 - if not worse			1
' they [ @entity7 ] are losing — so @entity84 out , @entity85 in			0
why ? play them together			0
they will say , " ah , but @entity7 has its own system , its own philosophy " — hell , if it is not working , you change			2
