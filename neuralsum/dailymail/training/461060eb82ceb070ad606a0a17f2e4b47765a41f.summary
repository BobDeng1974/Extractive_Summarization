in the cloakroom of the @entity4 gymnastics club , 10 pairs of tiny shoes are lined up			2
they belong to toddlers making their first foray into a world of tumbling and soaring leaps in the ground - floor gymnasium			2
not so long ago @entity11 was among them			1
still only 17 , she now trains alone on the top floor of this huge warehouse - style building in @entity15 , an inner city area of @entity17			1
the roofs of the neighbouring back - to - back terraced houses are visible from the windows as she bounces across the sprung floor , keenly observed by coaching duo @entity22 and @entity23			2
@entity24 still holds the same magic for @entity11 as it did when she first left her shoes at the door more than a decade ago , but it is serious business , too			1
@entity11 receives the @entity30 in the @entity31 in december 2014 fragapane in action during the 2014 @entity34 in @entity35 earlier in the year the 4ft 6in powerhouse , is tipped to evolve into @entity38 ’s greatest gymnast			1
this summer she became the first englishwoman in 84 years to win four gold medals at the @entity34 and at the @entity42 in @entity43 in october she made four individual finals			1
‘ i ’ve been amazed by it all , ’ says @entity11 , words tumbling from her mouth as quickly as she spins through the air			1
‘ if someone asked me before i would have said “ no way will i do all that ”			2
it ’s not so much the feeling of winning i love but the feeling of doing something to the best of my ability			2
’ in @entity35 she won vault , floor , all - around and team gold			1
she has been recognised with a dizzy whirl of award nominations and is a strong favourite to follow @entity64 and @entity65 by winning the @entity67 ’s @entity66 today , from a shortlist of three with para-cyclist @entity69 and golfer @entity70			2
‘ the awards are a nice chance to dress up , ’ says @entity11			1
‘ in training i do n’t make an effort at all , i just chuck my hair up			2
we ’ve got a rule that we can be as scruffy and vile as we want and nobody will mind			0
’ here the focus has already turned to the @entity80 in 2016			0
@entity11 is taking advantage of a break between sessions , leaning against the wall of the gym demolishing sandwiches from her lunch box			1
she has spent the morning working on a new , more tricky vault			0
by the time @entity90 comes round , they want to challenge @entity92 ’s @entity91 , currently the world ’s best on the apparatus			1
talk about @entity96 medals is kept to a minimum but @entity22 , herself a former @entity38 gymnast , acknowledges that @entity11 has the potential to deliver four medals in @entity102 , when she will still be just 18			1
‘ at the @entity104 ( in @entity105 in october ) you could sense countries like @entity107 were watching us in the gym , ’ says @entity22			0
‘ they have seen what we ’ve done at the @entity112 and in @entity113 and they now know we ’re a legitimate threat			0
’ fragapane on the beam during the 2014 @entity34 games @entity11 is only 17 - years - old and is four foot and six inches tall but being smaller can be an advantage it is not until you see @entity11 in the flesh that you get a sense of the phenomenal power she generates with her bulging thighs and rippling shoulders			1
gone are the days of @entity129 domination where only those built like classical ballet dancers , @entity132 and @entity133 , among others , could succeed			0
the reigning world all - around champion , @entity135 , of the @entity136 is a stocky 4ft 7in , while @entity138 , a 2008 @entity96 champion , is a similar build to @entity11			1
‘ gymnastics is one of the few sports where being small can be an advantage , ’ says @entity22			0
‘ @entity11 has an advantage when it comes to doing multiple somersaults			1
she ’d probably have been a good diver			0
or the @entity146 would love her			0
’ at 5ft 1in , @entity11 ’s father @entity147 is the tallest of the entire @entity11 clan , so she is unlikely to grow into a giant over the next few years , much to her disappointment			1
‘ i ’d like to grow so people do n’t look at me twice and be like “ how old is she ? ” because i do have an older face , ’ says @entity11			1
@entity147 , who migrated to @entity156 as a schoolboy , and @entity11 ’s mother @entity158 met in @entity17 and swiftly discovered they both originate from @entity161 villages just 40 minutes apart			1
they now have five daughters and @entity11 falls in the middle			1
‘ i love my women , ’ says @entity147 , whose accent is a curious mix of @entity167 and @entity17			0
‘ they are all positive people and i think @entity11 has always been a performer			1
she ’s not a show - off but we are not quiet people			2
’ @entity11 ( centre ) celebrates a gold medal with @entity176 ( left ) and @entity177 ( right ) @entity11 pictured competing in the floor final during the @entity34 games after @entity11 ’s success at the @entity34 , @entity147 held a party at the @entity183 play centre in @entity184 which he owns and runs with daughter @entity185 , 26			1
‘ we got all the families together , about 300 people , we @entity167 like the big gatherings , i can name you up to my third cousin			0
back in my home village of @entity194 , the consulate spread the news to the locals about @entity11 being a descendant of the village			1
’ @entity147 is a genial character but he puts his foot down when it comes to boyfriends			0
‘ i do n’t get close to the boyfriends because i ’d like them to get married or at least know they ’re properly together before that , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity11 is not having a boyfriend until she ’s 35			1
she says 18 but i ’ve said it has to be a prince , not an actual prince , rather a good bloke , but she does n’t have to know that yet			0
’ having finished school in the summer , @entity11 spends 35 hours a week in the gym			1
both @entity22 and @entity23 spend twice that amount , factoring in time spent searching for floor routine music , devising new moves and keeping an eye on her competition			2
@entity11 has set her focus upon success during the olympic games in @entity90 , @entity102 in 2016 @entity11 is one of the favourites to win @entity224 her floor routine in @entity105 broke new ground with break - dance style moves interspersed with traditional but exquisitely executed tumbles and twists			1
‘ we did n’t think of it as break - dancing , ’ says @entity23			2
‘ it actually came about because she was resting her feet , but it fitted well with the music			0
@entity11 has this cheeky grin which she flashes the judges and you ca n’t take your eyes off her			2
her sister @entity241 is exactly the same			0
’ @entity11 is coaching eight - year - old @entity241 as part of a group twice a week			1
‘ she treats me like a coach , ’ she says			0
‘ i like the fact i can relate to them ( the children ) because i ’m doing it at the moment			0
if they ’re tired i understand and can advise them			0
’ it is still a learning process for @entity11 , too			2
at the @entity104 , she slipped during her opening tumble , breaking her fall with her arms			0
to her credit she barely flinched , getting to her feet and completing her routine with panache			0
‘ i was trying too hard , ’ she says			0
‘ i was tired and my legs were like jelly beforehand			0
i was trying to be positive			0
as soon as i fell i was disappointed			0
but i just smiled at the judges and tried to give them a good time			2
it was still pretty impressive as a whole competition considering i was 16			0

@entity11 tipped to win @entity224
17 - year - old gymnast won four gold medals at 2014 @entity34 games
she is now targeting @entity96 glory in @entity90 in under two years time
