enough planets exist in the @entity2 to ensure that there is at least one for each of the hundred million stars in the galaxy , @entity0 has revealed			2
analysis of data from the @entity10 space telescope shows that 17 billion planets in the galaxy are @entity13 - like in size			1
the findings are making scientists increasingly confident of finding a rocky planet the same size as @entity13 , with a similar orbit and situated in the ' habitable zone ' of a solar system			2
it is now believed - 17 billion @entity13 - like planets could exist in the @entity2 an artist 's impression of @entity32 , one of the planets identified by the @entity10 space telescope mission ' the analysis of increasingly longer time periods of @entity10 data uncovers smaller planets in longer period orbits -- orbital periods similar to @entity13 's , " said @entity42 , of @entity0 's @entity43 in @entity44			1
' it is no longer a question of will we find a true @entity13 analogue , but a question of when			0
' one of the most exciting findings is that four planets have been identified which are less than twice the size of @entity13 and orbit in their sun 's habitable zone , the region in the planetary system where liquid water might exist on the surface of a planet			2
latest findings released by @entity0 show that since february last year there have been 461 potential new planets discovered			1
these bring the total number of potential planets that have been identified by the @entity10 mission to 2,740 and they orbit 2,036 stars			1
a breakdown by size of potential planets identified by the @entity10 mission			1
among the most dramatic increases is in the number of @entity13 - sized and super @entity13 - sized planets			1
discoveries of @entity13 - sized planets increased by 43 per cent while those of super earths rose by 21 per cent			1
@entity80 planetary astronomer @entity79 said : ' we are showing that there is about one planet per star , and that gives us a total of about a hundred billion planets throughout our galaxy			0
' the vast majority of those planets are orbiting stars that are very much different from our sun. ' several of the planets being identified are in the same solar system , just as @entity13 is one of eight planets orbiting the @entity97 ' the large number of multi-candidate systems being found by @entity10 implies that a substantial fraction of exoplanets reside in flat multi-planet systems , " said @entity98 , planetary scientist at @entity43			1
' this is consistent with what we know about our own planetary neighborhood			0
' the kepler space telescope was launched by @entity0 in 2009 with the intention of finding @entity13 - like planets			1
it pinpoints potential new planets by measuring the dimming of starlight as planets pass between stars and the telescope			0
not all dimming is caused by planets and it is only once dimming has been observed three times that it is formally attributed to a potential planet			0
further measurements and observations are required to confirm the identification			0
in the last year the number of confirmed planets pinpointed by @entity10 has risen from 33 to 105			2
newborn star : @entity130 110 is a geyser of hot gas from a newborn star that splashes up against and ricochets off the dense core of a cloud of molecular hydrogen far far away : lying 45 million light - years away from @entity13 in the southern constellation of @entity139 , a bright star - forming ring that surrounds the heart of the barred spiral galaxy cosmic dance : about 300 million light - years away , only four of these five galaxies are actually locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters @entity148 of the @entity149 presented the latest @entity10 findings at a meeting of the @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity44 , on monday			1
the @entity154 has accepted a paper detailing the research for publication			0
@entity158 , a scientist at the @entity159 which researches signs off extra-terrestrial intelligence , said that 58 planets found so far are believed to be in their host stars ' habitable zones			0
that means that any water on them has a chance of being in liquid form because the region is close enough to the star to be warm enough for ice to melt but not so close that it all evaporates			0
near death : a new photo of @entity178 system 's largest star suffering a near - death experience before it goes supernova in the near future planets orbiting close to their suns are likely to be infernos while planets in distant orbits are likely to be icy , he said			0
@entity158 also analyzed the latest @entity10 data			0
the @entity10 launched on march 7 , 2009 , and has been active for 3 years , 10 months and 1 day as of january 8 , 2013			0
the space observatory was named in honor of the 17th - century @entity192 astronomer @entity191			0
@entity10 is part of @entity0 's @entity194 which runs relatively low - cost scientific research missions			2
the observatory â€™s mission going forward is to find and document @entity13 - sized planets at greater distances			1
the more planets discovered with @entity13 - like orbits in their habitable zones , the greater the chances of extra-terrestrial life , scientists say			1
sun - like star : located just beyond the tip of the tail of the constellation of @entity211 , this butterfly - shaped cloud of glowing gas and dust is the wreckage of a star similar to the @entity97 distorted galaxies : @entity218 are a pair of distorted colliding spiral galaxies about 70 million light - years away , in the constellation of @entity222 cosmic collision : the result of a cosmic collision where a smaller galaxy plunged right through the heart of a larger one and shot out the other side			2

chances of finding extra terrestrial life boosted by latest analysis
@entity0 believes almost every sun - like star could have at least one planet
461 potential planets identified by the @entity10 mission since february 2012
dramatic increase in number of @entity13 - sized planets
