@entity1 player @entity0 is guilty of producing one of the worst tackles you 're likely to see this season after his kung - fu style tackle on a @entity9 player - but unbelievably the referee waved play on			1
it was a kick @entity12 would have been proud of , as he connected cleanly with @entity14 's rib - cage and sending his opponent crashing to the floor			0
the defender made the headlines for the right reasons during @entity27 play - off against @entity21 back in august , when he saved two penalties during the shoot - out - after their goalkeeper had been sent off			2
@entity0 ( centre right ) kung - fu @entity28 during @entity1 clash with @entity9 his heroics sent the @entity33 side through to the @entity27 group stages as he established himself as a club legend			1
but @entity0 's kick on @entity14 shows a different side and the misdemeanor during the first half went unpunished as his side went on to win the contest 4 - 0 - sending them six points clear of their rivals at the top			0
it could have been so different for the away side if he had been given his marching orders but due to some shocking refereeing , that was n't the case			0
