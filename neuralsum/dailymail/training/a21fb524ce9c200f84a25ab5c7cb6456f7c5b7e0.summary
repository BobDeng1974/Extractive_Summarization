no deal : @entity22 leader @entity21 , left , leaves a meeting with @entity25 leader @entity24 , right after failing to reach an agreement to form a coalition government and end the country 's political deadlock @entity5 now looks set to have to hold a second general election after @entity22 leader @entity21 gave up on attempts to raise enough support for his anti-austerity agenda			1

‘ we ca n't make our dream come true and form a left - wing government			1
’ @entity21 was given the presidential mandate on tuesday and tasked with forming a government after first - placed conservative leader @entity24 - who backs the country 's international bailout terms - failed to do so within hours of getting the mandate on monday			2
next in line is socialist leader @entity60 , @entity5 's former finance minister			2
if he also fails , the president will host party leaders in a last - ditch effort to avoid new elections next month			0
@entity24 , leader of the @entity66 , left , failed to reach agreement with @entity21 , head of the left party @entity68 , right , during a bit to try and see if there is any possibility of forming a government the pound is going strong against the euro as it reached a three - and - a - half - year high today if he also fails , elections will be called in three or four weeks in the hope of breaking the deadlock			1
@entity60 said he would continue the search for a coalition when his turn comes but there seems little space for compromise between pro and anti-bailout forces , almost equally balanced in parliament			0
‘ we must form a government and give the country prospects for the future , hope and security , ’ @entity60 said yesterday , @entity21 said @entity5 should pull out of its bailout commitments , saying the financial pain hitting ordinary @entity5 has been too high			1

the @entity109 holidays @entity110 and @entity111 have been scrapped			0
the day off to commemorate the formation of @entity99 also goes - as does the day to celebrate independence from @entity114			0

the @entity11 @entity138 was up 0.32 percent after falling earlier			2
@entity114 's financial markets were also shaken as investors were worried about the fallout from @entity5 's political crisis and awaited details of the @entity114 government 's latest plan to shore up the banking sector			1
the yield on @entity114 10 - year bonds rose to 6.02 percent by late afternoon , a jump of 0.24 percentage points on the day and uncomfortably high			0
bond yields indicate the rate the government borrows at when it taps financial markets			0
just a few weeks ago it would have been heresy for chancellor @entity158 's supporters to suggest that @entity5 throws in the towel - but not any longer			2
' we should make @entity5 the offer to leave the eurozone in an orderly fashion , without leaving the @entity124 , ” said @entity164 , the budgetary expert for @entity158 's @entity166 party			1
he told wednesday ’s business daily @entity167 it was ' not up to the @entity11 to tell the @entity5 how to live , ' but that weekend election results indicated they were ' not willing ' to implement the @entity171 - dictated savings course			1
' the dogma that no country can leave the eurozone has already caused too much political damage in @entity176 , ' he added			2
president @entity177 , right , has given @entity21 , left , the mandate to try to form a government @entity180 , deputy chairman of the @entity166 in parliament , said ; ' it is clear that if the new @entity5 government , contrary to expectations , does not keep to the contracts , it will have to accept the consequences already announced			1
' @entity188 , a finance expert from the @entity166 ’s coalition partner the @entity189 , also said he was open to a possible exit of the @entity5 from the eurozone			1
' one must be prepared , ' he added			0
' the government should now , at the very latest , draw up a plan @entity194 ' @entity11 's @entity180 , pictured , said that if @entity5 fails to keep its side of the deal it will have to face the consequences the head of economics at the @entity201 in @entity202 , @entity203 , said : ' it is absolutely correct to develop a @entity205 which would enable the exit of @entity5 in the most orderly fashion ' at the moment that which many have feared is happening – the necessary internal devaluation through wage and price reductions is politically barely tenable			1
' @entity5 is in its fifth year of recession with unemployment at 20 percent – and had committed itself to earmarking in june another € 11.5billion in savings over the next two years			2
all bets are off after the weekend vote which saw people vote against more austerity			0
@entity11 's @entity221 magazine ran the headline yesterday ' welcome to @entity223 ' in an essay about @entity5 - a reference to the post @entity226 in @entity11 that collapsed under chronic debt triggered by the @entity229 and which ushered in the @entity230			1
