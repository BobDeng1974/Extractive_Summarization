a judge has attacked @entity2 ’s most senior policeman over ’s his force ’s treatment of the innocent man framed by disgraced @entity7 commander @entity6 , saying he had ‘ thrown him to the wolves ’			1
metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity10 was blasted over his force ’s reluctance to pay damages to web designer @entity14 , whose evidence helped bring down the lying police chief			1
in an extraordinary broadside , his honour judge @entity18 attacked sir @entity10 ’s claim that the @entity7 was not responsible for @entity6 ’s conduct			1
@entity24 broadside : his honour judge @entity18 ( left ) blasted metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity10 ( right ) over his force 's reluctance to pay damages to an innocent man he added that mr @entity30 had been to ‘ hell and back ’ by twice giving evidence against @entity6 , who arrested him unlawfully while serving in the force			1
details of judge @entity18 ’s attack on the @entity38 boss can be revealed after the @entity39 won a battle lasting several months to obtain transcripts of the court showdown between lawyers representing mr @entity30 and sir @entity10			1
the @entity7 had previously declined to comment when asked if it had been rebuked by the judge during a hearing at the @entity45 – at which no journalists were present			0
this meant the @entity39 had to make a special application to get transcripts of what was said			2
@entity6 , 52 , was first convicted of framing young businessman @entity52 in a street row over money in 2010			2
he was jailed for four years , but his convictions for misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice were quashed by the @entity60 a year later			0
the @entity65 - born commander - dubbed a ‘ @entity64 ’ by the head of the police watchdog - was found guilty for a second time at a retrial in february 2012 and received a three - year prison sentence			0
@entity69 : @entity38 commander @entity6 ( right ) after he arrested @entity71 ( left ) at @entity73 police station in west @entity74 in july 2008 a panel of judges headed by the lord chief justice , lord judge , has since thrown out another appeal bid by @entity6 , a former president of the @entity79 who repeatedly played the race card to bully cowardly yard bosses into tolerating his conduct			1
now it can be revealed that in the aftermath of @entity6 ’s second conviction , mr @entity30 , 30 , launched a damages claim against the @entity7 over his ordeal			1
at the @entity45 barrister @entity88 , representing the @entity7 , said that the force was not responsible for @entity6 ’s actions and suggested that mr @entity30 should sue the former officer for damages instead			1
but judge @entity18 said mr @entity30 ‘ has at least in part been put through hell and back again because he has given evidence in support of a prosecution where his name has been pilloried in cross examination ’			2
‘ he has achieved partial vindication by virtue of the jury convicting @entity6 twice , ’ he added			0
‘ but here he is asserting his civil rights , only to be thrown to the wolves by the commissioner , i assume on cogent instructions at the highest level			0
’ the judge paid tribute to mr @entity30 ’s stand against @entity6 , whom he described as being ‘ a blatant and downright liar ’			1
‘ without mr @entity30 ’s evidence there would have been no prospect whatsoever of convicting @entity6 , ’ he added			1
ordeal : the judge said web designer @entity14 ( left ) had been to ' hell and back ' by twice giving evidence against disgraced @entity7 commander @entity6 ( right ) , who arrested him unlawfully clearly irritated by the @entity7 ’s stance , the judge ruled : ‘ i hold that the defendant ( the @entity7 ) must inexorably and inevitably and beyond any reasonable argument be responsible for his actions , which are manifestly so closely connected with his office as a police commander employed by the @entity7			1
’ coverage in the mail : @entity6 , 52 , was first convicted of framing young businessman @entity52 in a street row over money in 2010 it is understood mr @entity30 received a ‘ substantial five figure sum ’ from the @entity7			1
@entity38 declined to comment on how much compensation it had agreed to pay mr @entity30			2
‘ his honour judge @entity18 found that the commissioner was vicariously liable for the torts committed by former commander @entity6			2
an apology did not form part of the settlement , ’ said a spokesman			0
asked whether the judge had criticised the @entity7 , the spokesman said : ‘ various arguments were put forward by both parties for the judge to consider			0
the judge found in favour of the claimant			0
’ last @entity149 @entity38 sparked fury after it paid off @entity6 to escape an embarrassing public legal battle			2
the @entity153 officer had launched a claim against his former employer for racial and religious discrimination and hoped to win a payout of more than £ 1million			0
in return for @entity6 dropping his legal claim , the @entity7 and its oversight body the @entity161 ( @entity162 ) made a contribution towards @entity6 ’s legal costs – thought to be worth more than £ 50,000 – but did not pay him any compensation			0
in addition , @entity162 said it was seeking to seize a large portion of @entity6 ’s police pension			0
a @entity162 spokesman said last night : ‘ we can confirm that a decision to forfeit a portion of mr @entity6 ’s pension has been approved			0
this decision is now subject to a judicial review in the @entity177			0
’ mr @entity30 could not be reached for comment .			2
