by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 12 october 2013 updated : 08:11 est , 12 october 2013 a water park where visitors will be to swim with wild dolphins before sitting down to eat the meat of the mammal is being planned in @entity6			1
the controversial tourist trap has been announced by town of @entity9 in the south - east of the country which is already known for its mass dolphin hunts which turn the shoreline blood red			1
the fishing town was made famous when an @entity15 - winning documentary called ' @entity16 ' revealed how the animals are rounded up in the sea before being stabbed to death for their meat			1
controversial : @entity9 fisherman , above , will retain dolphins in a cove by surrounding them with nets and keeping them in the sea , visitors can then view them in their natural environments from boats @entity31 : the rest of the captured dolphins will be killed for meat to be served to tourists , a practice made infamous in the 2009 oscar winning documentary , ' @entity16 ' , pictured above but rather than bowing to global pressure to ban the practice after the film was released in 2009 , @entity9 officials say they want to capitalise on their dolphin trade by keeping some alive for entertainment in a sealed off ' safari ' part of their bay while others are killed for catering			1
@entity50 , a government official for the town , said : ' we already use dolphins and small whales as a source of tourism in the cove where dolphin - hunting takes place			2
' in summer swimmers can enjoy watching the mammals that are released from a partitioned - off space			2
' but we plan to do it on a larger scale			0
this is part of @entity9 's long - term plan of making the whole town a park , where you can enjoy watching marine mammals while tasting various marine products , including whale and dolphin meat ' the attraction will be separate from @entity75 , the place into which local fishermen corral dolphins , select a few dozen for sale and slaughter the rest for meat			1
if the plan goes ahead , a whale safari park stretching roughly 69 acres will be created by putting nets up around the entrance to @entity88 which is in the north west of the town			2
killed for sale : the town of @entity9 has a license to slaughter thousands of dolphins every year big business : dolphin meat , shown above , is a major source of industry for the fishing town black whales and bottlenose dolphins caught in waters near the town would be released into the area , which would be developed as a nature park			1
officials are looking to open part of the park within five years , @entity50 said			0
@entity110 prefecture , in which the town is located , said the town caught 1,277 dolphins in 2012 and has licence to capture 2,026 this season , which began in september and runs until august			2
@entity119 - based conservationist group @entity118 ( @entity117 criticised the plans			0
@entity121 , secretary general of the group said : ' marine mammals migrate across oceans , and international public opinion is that wildlife should be allowed to live as they are			0
' the plan will only ignite more protests over dolphin - hunting			0
' in the wild : protestors have criticised the plans for the park , saying that cashing in on the slaughter of dolphins will only lead to further protest in @entity6 and the rest of the world despite international outrage , however , locals in @entity9 argue that dolphin - hunting is part of a 400 - year - old whaling and culinary tradition			1
@entity6 regularly draws criticism for its annual whale hunt in the @entity148 , with @entity149 bringing the issue to the @entity151 this year			0
@entity119 defends the practice as internationally legal ' scientific research '			0
the 2009 film " @entity16 " brought @entity9 to worldwide attention , winning an @entity15 the following year , after graphically showing the killing of dozens of trapped animals , including by using underwater cameras			1
activists continue to visit the town to protest the hunt .			0
