by @entity0 , arts correspondent ruled out : @entity1 was nominated for an obe twice , but never made the cut he was one of the nation ’s best - loved comics – but although @entity1 was shortlisted twice for an obe , he was snubbed both times			2
until now his closest family were unaware of the recommendations			1
and it seems @entity1 ’s relationship with a married woman may have been what gave the powers - that - be pause for thought			2
@entity16 files requested by @entity17 show that the @entity19 host was recommended to receive the honour first in the @entity21 of 1987 and then again in the @entity22 of 1989			1
the official records are partly redacted and do not explain why @entity1 – famous for his gurning and mother - in - law jokes – was not honoured on either occasion			1
but in 1987 , the star ’s colourful and very public love life produced a string of lurid headlines that may have prompted politicians or civil servants to have second thoughts			1
his popularity at the time was unquestionable			2
@entity1 ’s jokes were enjoyed by tv audiences of millions , and prince @entity38 was one of his biggest fans			2
he was also a tireless fundraiser , garnering more than £ 1 million for showbusiness and cancer charities			0
yet a @entity45 request by this newspaper has revealed that officials still turned him down			0
in 1987 , a year after losing his beloved first wife @entity49 to cancer , the then father of three was hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons			1
he started to date barmaid @entity53 , who was not only 17 years his junior but also married			1
a second woman then stepped forward to publicly identify herself as another ‘ secret lover ’			1
@entity53 was to become @entity1 ’s second wife , but at the time , news of the relationship sparked a media frenzy			0
second wife : @entity1 tied the knot in 1989 with @entity53 , a barmaid 17 years his junior who was initially married @entity53 ’s then husband @entity64 accused @entity1 of ‘ stealing his wife ’			1
@entity1 ’s family last night said they had been unaware of the recommendations until contacted by @entity17			1
@entity53 , now 64 , said : ‘ i know he did n’t know anything about this and there was no question of him ever having turned it down			0
‘ he was always thrilled when other people were honoured and i think he would have adored it			0
to be honest i was amazed he did n’t get an honour and it may have been something he felt strongly about			1
but if he did , he never said anything about it			0
’ @entity53 said she did not think the short - lived publicity about his private life should have ruled him out but she said it was difficult to ‘ understand how these people think ’			0
‘ he would have been absolutely thrilled even just to have been considered			0
he was very a humble man and never talked about awards ' - @entity1 's daughter @entity84 his daughter @entity84 by his first marriage said : ‘ i was n’t even aware @entity87 had even been in the running for this and i must admit it has brought a big smile to my face			1
he would have been absolutely thrilled even just to have been considered			0
he was very a humble man and never talked about awards			0
’ his personal politics were unlikely to have ruled him out from the honour because he was known as a supporter of the then prime minister @entity96			1
@entity1 ’s curmudgeonly tv persona , which frequently saw him dressed in drag , belied the fact that he was a well - read intellectual and gifted pianist			0
he had a lifelong passion for the @entity103 language and wrote 16 books			0
his personal library amounted to more than 4,000 books and @entity1 loved the work of @entity108 , persuading a friend , playwright @entity109 , to adapt the @entity110 for the @entity111			0
@entity1 married @entity53 in 1989 and the couple had a daughter , @entity114 , before his untimely death at the age of 62 in 1993			2
he was honoured with a memorial service at @entity118 the following year and , 15 years after his death , a bronze statue was unveiled in his home town of @entity122 in @entity123			2
a @entity16 spokesman last night declined to provide further information about the recommendations .			2

until now the comic 's closest family were unaware of recommendations
@entity19 host was put forward for honour in 1987 and again in 1989
but official records are partially redacted and do not explain *rejection*
he was making headlines for *girlfriend* 17 years his junior and ' secret lover '
