by @entity0 published : 04:57 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 05:12 est , 10 december 2013 @entity1 has risked angering @entity2 by refusing to appoint a powerful figure to spearhead a renegotiation of @entity6 ’s relationship with the @entity7			1
the prime minister insisted foreign secretary @entity9 and @entity11 minister @entity10 were ‘ making good progress ’ and headed ‘ one of the most expert groups of people i could have ’			1
there have been growing calls from conservative mps suspicious of the @entity21 ’s attitude to @entity22 for mr @entity1 to bring in a senior @entity23 to start talks with other @entity7 leaders			1
pressure : @entity1 , addressing reporters at the @entity29 memorial service in @entity30 today , is facing criticism at home from @entity23 @entity2 mps those touted for the post have included former cabinet minister @entity36 and backbench mp @entity37 , one of the leaders of the ‘ @entity44 ’ group of mps who have been working on a blueprint for a looser , more trade - based relationship with the @entity7			1
others @entity2 mps have suggested that a leading figure from business should be brought in to fill the role			1
but mr @entity1 , asked if he intended to appoint an @entity7 renegotiator , said : ‘ i have got in @entity9 and his team probably one of the most expert groups of people i could have			1
‘ i think @entity10 as the @entity11 minister played a huge role working in this area and i think we are making good progress			1
’ @entity1 the prime minister said that critics had expressed doubts about the government ’s strategy when he first set out plans for a renegotiation followed by an ‘ in / out ’ referendum on @entity6 ’s @entity7 membership earlier this year			1
‘ some people said at the time , “ well i am not sure you will bring the business community along with this argument ”			0
i think we broadly have - we have very strong support for negotiate and then decide with a referendum			0
‘ a lot of people said “ well you wo n't get a lot of support amongst @entity11 countries for this agenda ”			2
in fact if you read what a number of my colleagues have said there is an understanding of what @entity6 is trying to achieve not just for herself but the whole @entity7			2
‘ also , since that stage there have been some quite positive developments			0
the fact that we have actually cut the @entity11 budget , i think that is important , the business taskforce on deregulation , i think that is important			0
‘ so i think we have a very strong team , it is work done between the chancellor , the prime minister and foreign secretary			1
we are absolutely taking the lead on this issue because it is so important for the future of our country but i am satisfied with the way it is going			0
’ backing : the prime minister insists foreign secretary @entity9 ( left ) is the right person to lead the negotiations eurosceptic @entity2 backbencher @entity112 expressed concern about the prime minister ’s remarks			1
‘ it is very unlikely that the foreign secretary or the @entity11 minister are even minded to get a great new deal for us , let alone likely to get one , ’ mr @entity112 said			2
‘ the official mindset of the @entity21 exercises a very powerful grip on ministers			2
the only thing that can shore up @entity6 membership is a very radical and anti-establishment renegotiation			0
i do n’t think the establishment can deliver that			0
’ mr @entity112 said mr @entity1 ’s refusal to appoint a special envoy to spearhead renegotiation would increase the chances of a @entity6 exit from the @entity7			2
‘ that makes it far easier for me , when the time comes , to persuade undecided voters to leave , ’ he added			0
@entity140 , chairman of the @entity142 scrutiny committee , said @entity6 needed an ‘ absolutely @entity144 negotiating team ’			0
‘ those of us who were there in 1990 would be best placed to make the right judgements			0
if you want to deal with this properly there has to be fundamental change and the evidence is that they are just nibbling at the treaties			0
’ mr @entity10 yesterday wrote to a group @entity157 members who had drawn up a ‘ shopping list ’ of @entity7 reforms for the forthcoming renegotiation			1
team : @entity11 minister @entity10 ( left ) has written to a group @entity2 party members who had drawn up a ¿ shopping list ¿ of @entity7 reforms for the forthcoming renegotiation in his letter , reported by the @entity167 magazine , the minister focused on the prospect of @entity11 - wide reform , rather than the likelihood of a new relationship with the @entity7 for the @entity6			1
‘ since the prime minister ’s speech the debate across @entity11 has begun to shift : more and more national leaders are talking about powers coming back from @entity22			1
that is not to say that great challenges do n’t remain : they do , ’ he wrote			0
mr @entity10 insisted that @entity6 has been ‘ leading the charge ’ on making the @entity7 more competitive , pointing to progress towards a streamlined process for patents across @entity11 and capping roaming charges for mobile phone users			1
he said the @entity6 wants a new structure of @entity7 membership that accommodates those still keen to pursue its founding principle of ‘ ever closer union ’ as well as those , like @entity6 , who do not			2
‘ we want an end to the obligation on all @entity7 members to subscribe to an “ ever closer union among the peoples of @entity11 ” and instead see the @entity201 @entity200 ’s proposed principle of the “ @entity11 level only when necessary , at national level whenever possible ” put in place , ’ he wrote			2
however , the minister gave members little indication of the government ’s specific aims			0
he merely promised to note ‘ carefully ’ their views on immigration , agriculture , and employment and welfare regulation .			0
