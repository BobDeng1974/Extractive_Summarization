' i said that i 'd been to the @entity5 and i tried to talk to people and they were n't interested and they said it was because he was serving in a foreign regiment , ' she said			2
' i do n't think we talk about a @entity12 regiment as a " foreign regiment " i think we talk about it as an " ally "			0
' lieutenant @entity1 and the @entity33 of the @entity34 @entity1 was born in @entity35 in 1892 , the eldest son of an eminent surgeon			0

@entity12 casualties at @entity82 - part of the @entity48 which was the first major battle the @entity12 were involved with in @entity2 ' it 's a scramble because the @entity2 put an article in the paper , ' she said			2
mrs @entity20 said she is not angry it has taken almost a century for @entity1 to be added to the @entity13			2
' i 'm just slightly bemused , ' she said			0

' he does , however , meet the criteria for the @entity13 , which honours @entity3 known to have fought and died in allied forces			1
' since we do n't hold @entity12 service records here at the @entity5 , we have to rely on the descendants of men like @entity131 to approach the @entity5 with sufficient archival evidence and make an application for inclusion			1
' the family of @entity1 has never approached the @entity5 with an application			2
