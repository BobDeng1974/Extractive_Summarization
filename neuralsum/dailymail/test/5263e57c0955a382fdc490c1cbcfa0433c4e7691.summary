the @entity20 last week said that more than 500 people had been killed in two weeks of fighting in @entity5			1
on saturday it called for a 24 - hour humanitarian pause in the conflict to allow aid to reach people cut off by air strikes and to save the lives of ' streams of wounded '			2
but hopes of getting aid into the country by tomorrow are fading , as they seek clearance from @entity36 states waging the air strikes and hunt for planes prepared to fly to @entity5			2
@entity41 strikes : it is thought about 500 people have been killed in two weeks of fighting in @entity5 - but so far , the @entity1 has not been able to gain entry to the @entity46 country carnage : the aid agency has been negotiating for a week to deliver life - saving supplies and equipment to @entity5 , where the coalition has conducted 11 days of air strikes against @entity15 - backed @entity14 people stand on the rubble of houses destroyed by an air strike in @entity58 village near @entity59 over the weekend supporters of the @entity62 rebels raise rifles as they shout slogans against the @entity8 - led air strikes in @entity59 discussions : @entity67 is currently in talks about whether to enter the conflict - but the country 's political leaders , like @entity72 , who leads @entity67 @entity74 ( @entity74 ) party , are urging diplomacy ' dialogue for peace ' : members of @entity67 's civil society chant slogans against the @entity8 - led coalition targeting @entity83 rebels in @entity5 , during a demonstration , in @entity85 ' we are still working on getting the plane to [ the @entity5 capital ] @entity59			1
it 's a bit difficult with the logistics because there are not that many companies or cargo planes willing to fly into a conflict zone , ' said @entity96 , a @entity2 spokesperson			0
the @entity1 is aiming to get 48 tonnes of medical supplies into @entity5 by plane			2
it is also trying to get staff by boat from @entity101 to @entity102 , but fighting has complicated efforts			0
earlier today in @entity107 , a spokesman for the @entity8 - led coalition said arrangements had been made for at least one @entity2 aid delivery yesterday morning , but the @entity1 - which deploys 300 aid workers to the @entity36 peninsula 's poorest country - had pulled out of the arrangement			1
' there was a trip fixed for them at nine this morning ... they informed us , after the time was set , of a request to delay the flight , ' brigadier general @entity117 told reporters yesterday , adding that this was because the company from which they had chartered the plane could not fly to @entity5			2
the @entity8 - led coalition says it has set up a special coordination body for aid deliveries and asked ngos and governments to work with it to ensure humanitarian aid can be brought into @entity5 and foreign nationals can be evacuated safely			1
the news comes on the same day as war - weary @entity67 began talks to enter the conflict after its staunch @entity8 allies issued an urgent request the country join the expanding coalition of @entity143 nations fighting @entity83 rebels in the country			1
prime minister @entity146 announced the special session of parliament last week , saying any decision on intervention could only come after proper debate			0
however , @entity67 's political leaders - including former cricketer @entity72 , the head of the @entity67 @entity74 ( @entity74 ) party - are calling for diplomacy and a negotiated settlement , saying it does not want to get involved in any conflict that would inflame sectarian tensions			2

since @entity8 , the @entity198 's main @entity143 power , asked @entity143 - majority @entity67 to join a @entity8 - led military coalition that began conducting air strikes last month against largely @entity14 @entity62 forces in @entity5 , @entity146 has hedged his bets			1
he has said repeatedly he will defend any threat to @entity8 's ' territorial integrity ' without defining what action such a threat might provoke			0
' they 're looking to satisfy @entity8 expectations at a minimal level , ' said @entity210 , a @entity211 - based adjunct scholar with the @entity212			2
' they 're unlikely to be part of any meaningful action inside @entity5			0
maybe they will reinforce the ( @entity8 ) border			0
' twelve days of fighting has not only killed hundreds of people , but cut off water and electricity and led @entity222 to warn @entity5 is heading towards a humanitarian disaster			1
for the people trapped between the warring sides , the arrival of the @entity1 could not come soon enough			0
street fighting and heavy shelling have torn through the streets of in @entity102 - the last bastion of support for the @entity8 - backed @entity232 - for days			1
sixty people were killed in heavy fighting on sunday alone , according to reports			0
residents claim a foreign warship had shelled @entity62 positions on the outskirts , but a spokesman for the coalition in @entity107 said its vessels were helping civilian evacuations , not shelling the @entity14			1
nevertheless , food , water and electricity shortages have mounted across the city , where combat has shut ports and cut land routes from the city			0
' how are we supposed to live without water and electricity ? ' pleaded @entity254 , a housewife walking through the city streets with her young children			0
she clutched a yellow plastic jerry can , like dozens of other residents on the streets and in queues seeking water from public wells or mosque faucets after supplies at home dried up			0

endemic tax dodging means @entity67 needs regular injections of foreign cash to avoid economic meltdown			0
last year , the @entity8 gave @entity67 $ 1.5 billion			1
@entity8 also sheltered @entity146 after he was overthrown in a 1999 military coup			0
but joining the @entity8 - led coalition could inflame a sectarian conflict at home where around a fifth of the population is @entity14 and attacks on @entity83 are increasing , further destabilising the nuclear - armed nation of 180 million people			1
@entity67 intervention would probably also anger @entity14 power @entity15 , which shares a long and porous border in a region roiling with its own separatist insurgency			1
@entity67 's other main borders are with arch enemy @entity359 and @entity361 , where @entity67 troops are already conducting anti-taliban operations			0

they have advanced to the city center despite 11 days of air strikes by a @entity8 - led coalition of mainly @entity198 air forces			1
@entity403 launched the air strikes on march 26 in an attempt to turn back the @entity15 - allied @entity14 , who already control @entity5 's capital @entity59 , and restore some of @entity232 's crumbling authority			1
the air and sea campaign has targeted @entity62 convoys , missiles and weapons stores and cut off any possible outside reinforcements - although the @entity14 deny @entity8 accusations that they are armed by @entity416 .			1
