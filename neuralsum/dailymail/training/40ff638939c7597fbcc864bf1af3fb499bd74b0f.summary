the mother lion was clearly unimpressed with the mischievous juvenile ’s antics when it tried to take a swipe at her			1
so she grabbed it by the scruff of the neck with the cub 's head wedged between her jaws - making it appear like she was about swallow whole the head of the cub			1
that 's quite a mouthful : this is the moment a lioness gave her cheeky cub a telling off by clamping her jaws around its head and despite the cub 's squirming , the mother lion refused to loosen her grip until she felt it had got the message to behave			2

the amusing moment was caught on camera by wildlife photographer @entity45 in @entity46			1
