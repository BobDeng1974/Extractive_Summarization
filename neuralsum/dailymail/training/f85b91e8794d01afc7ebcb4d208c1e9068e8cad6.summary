@entity0 plans to build a bridge linking the @entity3 region of @entity4 to @entity5 look set to be revived after @entity5 prime minister @entity6 created a company to take on the project			1
the proposed bridge would span the the @entity10 between the @entity11 in @entity5 and the @entity12 in @entity4 , giving @entity5 one of only three major entrance points to the strategic @entity3 peninsula - the others being the @entity18 and @entity19 motorways from mainland @entity4			1
the idea for a bridge linking the countries was originally conceived by @entity24 architect @entity23 during the @entity25 in the hope it would aid the @entity24 invasion of the @entity28			1
not finished : a retreating @entity0 army left behind an incomplete 2.8 mile stretch of bridge ( pictured in background ) over the @entity10 in 1943			0
within two years it had started to crumble past : the idea for a bridge linking @entity5 to the @entity4 was originally conceived by @entity24 architect @entity23 ( pictured left with @entity35 )			1
@entity6 has now created a company to take on the project @entity6 said plans signed by @entity5 and @entity4 in 2010 to build the bridge are still binding , despite increased tensions between the countries following @entity5 's decision to send troops into the @entity3 region following the ousting of @entity4 president @entity46 last week			1
@entity5 has refused to recognise the new ' unconstitutional ' government in @entity48 which , it said , is run by militants and ultra-nationalists			0
it claims to have entered @entity3 in order to protect @entity5 - speakers who make up the majority of the population in the southern and regions of @entity4			2
during a meeting with his deputies on monday , @entity6 demanded practical work on the bridge begin immediately , saying : ' @entity4 has always been and will remain an important trade and economic partner to us , and the government should work on these issues			0
' we are following the developments closely , ' he added			0
idea : @entity35 personally commissioned a three - mile rail and road bridge based on @entity23 's plans ( pictured ) in 1943 in the hope it would help him conquer the @entity71 plans : the proposed bridge would link the @entity3 peninsula to the @entity5 region of @entity76 the @entity77 has a long history , little of which @entity6 will want to be associated with			1

the iron and concrete structure was to replace a rope bridge that had been built to support the retreat the @entity24 @entity87 the previous year			2
@entity23 was given just six months to build the new bridge , and in his memoirs raised doubts over how realistic the project was given how quickly the @entity71 army were approaching			0
' even at that time it was clear that the bridge would never be completed , ' @entity23 wrote			0
@entity71 troops arrive at the half - built bridge after @entity24 forces abandoned the area in november 1943 a destroyed @entity100 monument is pictured in front of ruins in @entity103 on the @entity3 following a battle between @entity105 and @entity71 troops left behind : soviets arrive in @entity77 after @entity24 forces abandoned the area and retreated towards @entity109 as @entity71 troops began their push towards @entity109 later in 1943 , the retreating @entity24 army left behind an incomplete 2.8 mile stretch of bridge that began to crumble within two years			1
by the 1960s the remains of the @entity0 bridge , much of which was now under the sea , became so dangerous to passing ships that they were cleared completely			0
since the @entity25 , various projects to span the strait have been proposed or attempted			0
the idea of a @entity77 bridge once again resurfaced after the collapse of the @entity71 in 1991 , but in 1994 the @entity5 and @entity4 sides failed to finalise the project and it appeared to have finally been scrapped			1
in 2010 , however , @entity4 president @entity46 and @entity5 president @entity6 signed a new agreement to build a bridge across the @entity77			2
in late january this year , the @entity4 and @entity5 governments decided that a new pan-national company would be commissioned to handle the construction of the bridge , while the @entity5 state enterprise @entity5 highways would become responsible for it long term			2
@entity6 's signing of a decree on monday stated his intention to see the project through , despite the @entity4 government being ousted , and increasing tensions between the countries .			0

bridge was originally designed by @entity105 to aid invasion of @entity71
it was left to crumble after @entity24 troops fled the region in late 1943
now @entity5 prime minister @entity6 demands bridge is built
it would give @entity5 one of only three major entrance routes into @entity3
