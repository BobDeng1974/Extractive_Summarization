despite their size the giraffes appeared to create perfect symmetry in what looked like a graceful dance number			2
two giraffes in @entity18 appeared to be dancing as they were photographed fighting for dominance the behaviour of crossing their necks is known as ' necking ' and is used to establish strength in the group but while the gentle giants appeared calm and graceful , the pair were in fact fighting for dominance			1
known as ' necking ' , the two males are seen swinging their huge necks in an attempt to take out their opponent			0
but incredibly , despite the duo 's aggressive behaviour , the giraffe 's movements still managed to be easy on the eye			2

the fights between the animals can be very brutal and can last from a few minutes to an hour the stunning movements , made in unison , are quite unusual to see for yourself in the wild ' i believe it 's the job of the photographer to show the world these amazing moments , ' @entity41 said the giraffes swing and cross their necks in sync as they perform these seemingly elaborate routines ' it is fascinating to watch and even though they are in battle they are still incredibly graceful in their movements			1
' generally , these type of moments are very interesting and it is quite unusual to see for yourself in the wild			0
' looking back the giraffes to appear to move in unison making for some very beautiful photographs			0
' i believe it is the job of the photographer to show the rest of the world these amazing moments			0

photographer @entity41 *captured* the images in the @entity44 , in @entity18
the giraffes appear to perform in sync and some refer to the act as ' dancing '
they are actually engaging in ' necking , ' which is an act of dominance between two male giraffes
the behaviour is incredibly graceful and stunning to observe
