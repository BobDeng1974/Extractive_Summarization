by @entity0 tackling issues : @entity2 , 29 , travelled all over @entity3 to see front line treatment for stutterers it was just a simple request to invite her godmother to her next ballet performance , but the moment is for ever etched in @entity2 ’s memory			1
as she stood in her tutu at the age of seven , her voice faltered and she was unable to get the question out			2
‘ try as i might , i just could n’t get past the b in ballet , ’ she says			2
‘ it felt like a barrier had closed the path from my lungs to my mouth			2
that was the first moment i was aware i had a stutter			2
’ now , 22 years later , @entity2 ’s stammer remains			1
this common speech problem affects about one person in every 100 , causing them to be blocked or stuck at the beginning , middle and end of words and leading them to repeat words several times over			1
the morning of our interview , i notice @entity2 is struggling with long , drawn - out @entity36			1
‘ and all the rest of the alphabet , ’ she laughs			2
such is the impact of her stutter that five years ago @entity2 , now 29 , decided to quit her job in asset management in @entity43 and set off on a year - long fact - finding trip around @entity3 to work out how she could rid herself of the speech impediment			1
after travelling from coast to coast to witness treatments at the forefront of stutter research , she has written a memoir about her experiences – which also led her to fall in love with a fellow stutterer			1
for in the course of that trip , it transpired that far from ruining her life , @entity2 ’s stutter was the making of her			1
‘ i am not sure who i would be without my stutter , ’ she says			2
‘ today i can see that stuttering has given me far more than it ever took away			2
’ it ’s a surprisingly positive attitude for someone who , by the age of eight , had transformed from an outgoing little girl to a shy , withdrawn child as her speech let her down			2
her worried parents took her to see the @entity71 ’s best speech therapists but watched in dismay as @entity2 continued to clench , whistle and choke on her words			1
‘ growing up , i heard strangers tell me to slow down , calm down or take a deep breath – as if stuttering was that easy to overcome , ’ @entity2 recalls			1
‘ i was desperate to find a way to “ fix ” my problem and went in and out of speech therapy for years trying to be fluent			1
’ while she was never bullied and had a loyal circle of friends , her stutter made her less vocal at school			2
‘ in class , i wanted to be able to interact and answer a question but held back , ’ she says			2
‘ for a while i became a sort of walking thesaurus			2
i ’d deliberately dodge hard words and rack my brain for an alternative			1
often i was n’t saying what i wanted to say			2
i felt my stutter made others question my intelligence and sanity			2
’ we clicked : @entity2 fell for @entity100 during a speech therapy course in @entity102 after @entity103 , @entity2 started climbing the corporate ladder in @entity43			1
although doing well at work and on the verge of promotion , at the age of 24 she still felt ashamed of her speech			0
it was time to take her stutter in hand			0
‘ for years i believed that stuttering was my fault , that it would hold me back , that it made me ugly , ’ she says			0
‘ the biggest battle i had to fight was breaking through the glass ceiling i ’d created for myself			0
’ so in september 2008 , @entity2 vowed to devote a year to touring the @entity3 , interviewing as many stutterers , researchers and speech therapists as possible			1
starting in @entity120 and travelling from state to state , she painstakingly researched the different schools of thought on the causes and cures			0
for years i believed that stuttering was my fault , that it would hold me back , that it made me ugly			0
i had created a glass ceiling for myself			0
‘ treatments ranged from vitamin supplements , relaxation classes and hypnosis to cranial osteopathy and electric shock treatment , ’ she says			1
‘ one involved whispering in a “ phone sex ” voice , and some therapists handed out gifts for fluent words – to positively reinforce the stutter out of our voices			1
’ in @entity145 , @entity2 met physician and fellow stutterer dr @entity147 , who believes that adults who stutter often have excessive dopamine in their brains , drawing strong similarities to @entity153 ’s syndrome			1
according to @entity147 , surplus dopamine can affect the brain ’s natural timer and speech initiation – something he remedied by taking asenapine ( commonly used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia ) with positive results			0
he claims his stutter would return within three days of him stopping medication			0
with 70 per cent of @entity147 ’s patients reporting benefits , this was the closest @entity2 had come to finding a cure – but she had reservations			1
‘ although drugs had helped many people , i was unsure about achieving fluency with medications that were still in their infancy for stuttering , ’ she says			0
‘ i wanted to continue my search			0
’ as well as interviewing doctors and researchers , @entity2 met stutterers from all walks of life – ranging from new @entity184 ranchers to @entity186 celebrities			1
‘ film star @entity187 confided that acting helped her to be someone else and overcome her stutter , while @entity189 told me about his experiences growing up with a father who stuttered			1
’ advice : @entity2 , from @entity43 , got advice from fellow londoner and stutterer @entity187 on her tour understanding : @entity189 also told miss @entity2 about growing up with a stammering father it was at a speech therapy course in @entity102 that @entity2 met her now - fiance @entity100			1
after an immediate rapport , their romance was sealed when he agreed to join her on a six - week research road trip from @entity207 to @entity145			0
‘ meeting @entity100 and falling in love with him changed the way i saw stuttering , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ i do n’t think i realised how interesting and attractive stutterers could be			0
watching his determination to be heard opened up a new way for me to be proud of who i was			0
’ @entity187 confided that acting helped her to be someone else and overcome her stutter			1
@entity189 told me about his experiences growing up with a father who stuttered			0
after 12 months exploring dozens of techniques , treatments and therapies , @entity2 came to an unexpected decision			1
rather than taking medication or speaking in a controlled manner , she would try voluntary stuttering – a technique pioneered in the 1950s by stutterer and speech therapist @entity226			0
‘ @entity226 did not believe that stutterers should or could speak fluently , ’ she explains			0
‘ instead , he preached self - acceptance			0
the idea is that if you stutter on purpose in the lead - up to a problematic word , then you will feel in control once you reach it			0
’ @entity2 first tried voluntary stuttering at a @entity120 @entity239 , deliberately stammering through her order without apology and taking as much time as she needed to get out each word			1
‘ it was empowering for me to be in control of my speech			0
stuttering on purpose allowed me to go through the motions without having the anxiety and worry , ’ she says			0
‘ it goes against the habits i ’ve learnt over the years but enables me to feel good , own the fact that i stutter and be extremely comfortable with it			0
’ now , four years on and living in @entity255 running a mobile phone exchange business with @entity100 , @entity2 sees her stutter as a quirk of her character rather than an enemy			1
‘ for ages it was as though my stutter was an impostor in my body but everyone has parts of themselves that they are worried about , or some vulnerability			0
ultimately my speech has given me the career i dreamed off , the man i want to grow old with – and introduced me to a community of incredible people			0
‘ i ’ve realised that our imperfections are actually what make us attractive and interesting			0
