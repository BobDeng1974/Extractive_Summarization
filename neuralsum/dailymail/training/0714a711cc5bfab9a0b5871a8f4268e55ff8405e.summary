humiliation : the photo was published in may 2005 editions of the @entity30 and @entity29 the @entity29 headline read , ' the tyrant 's in his pants ' while the @entity30 went with ' @entity37			1
' now , @entity5 lawmakers are charging that @entity3 and other @entity19 senior officials are snubbing authorities as they investigate allegations of phone hacking against the firm			0
' i urge the [ @entity45 ] to provide all the emails from @entity3 and [ his son ] @entity47 to @entity49 staff as a matter of urgency ... in particular to the photo of @entity12 , ' @entity53 mp @entity52 told the @entity5 's @entity4			0
he added it was ' difficult to see ' how editors and the reporters involved ' could possibly pretend that they did not know ' they obtained the photograph			2
he demanded answers ' otherwise , people will conclude in this country that @entity49 is still refusing to cooperate with the police			0
' president @entity63 had ordered an investigation into how @entity29 and the @entity30 obtained the photos , but never found the source of the leak			1
the @entity29 ’s former managing editor @entity68 said at the time that his newspaper paid ‘ more than £ 500 ( about $ 800 ) ' for the photos , but @entity52 he had information from ' two well - placed people inside @entity49 ' that the newspapers paid ' a substantial sum ' to a serving member of the @entity9 armed forces			1

’ ' we did n’t believe then , and certainly do n’t believe now , that it was wrong to acquire and publish newsworthy photographs of a notorious war criminal ' @entity19 spokesman more than 50 people have been arrested by the @entity133 as they investigate alleged payments to public officials in @entity136 , but detectives involved with the inquiry are not thought to be probing the @entity12 photo			0
