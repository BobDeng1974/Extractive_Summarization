lord @entity23 , chairman of the @entity24 is overseeing the new site , which he believes will provide a ‘ gold standard ’ of evidence to help maintain health and happiness			1
he said : ‘ we will not be telling people what they should do , but we will be providing them with a gold standard of scientific and research evidence if they want to improve their wellbeing in later life			1
’ the website , which will use data from @entity41 , the @entity42 and the office of @entity44 , will be able to answer questions concerning life expectancy and the benefits of improved diet			1
