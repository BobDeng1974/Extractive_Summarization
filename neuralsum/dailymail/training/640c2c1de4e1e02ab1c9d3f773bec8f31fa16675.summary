by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:55 est , 18 february 2014 @entity3 may be a groundbreaking product that opens up a new frontier in computing			2
however , there is one fact it has n't yet got away from - you look like an idiot using them			2
one firm hopes to change that by creating smart specs that look fashionable			1
it takes aim squarely at @entity26 , even through the search giant recently launched a range of designer frames that work with its lass computer			1
' for far too long wearable technology has been either very clunky or too futuristic , ' it said			1
' this paradigm does not bode well for the user when such a device is centered on their face			2
that standard will change with this campaign			0
' we have designed @entity16 with you , the user , in mind			0
' we have created a product line that can be as unique and as diverse as you are , complementing your face and your style			0
' the @entity16 glasses are the latest in a long line or wearable systems to be announced , with many hoping to take on @entity26 and @entity51 , which is believed to developing an activity tracking watch			1
the glasses are designed to look like normal spectacles - but hide a full ; computer and display ' most products headed into the smartspecs market are clunky , ostentatious , and draw attention away from you and toward the product itself , ' the firm says			1
' we are creating a device that extends your personality and capabilities instead of aiming to replace them			0
' however , the firm has not revealed exactly how its lenses work , simply saying they ' take on the form of conventional eyewear by employing a special set of optics that are blended into the lenses			1
the firm has also developed three special modes for the glasses , @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity82			1
using your phone 's on - board sensors , the system knows if you are sitting down , running , or in your car , and will automatically switch between modes and displays			0
the ' normal ' mode , which displays all of a users social media notifications active mode is where fitness and other on - the - go widgets will be placed			0
in active mode updates from social networks and email will be limited just to numerical characters that indicate the quantity of notifications from each social network			0
driving mode shows satnav directions along with a smart lane assist ' this simplified elegance is also present in our user interface and overall experience			0
' the user interface is mostly comprised of a stream of information presented in a way which does not interfere with your central portion of vision			0
' this enables a user experience that is similar to that of a heads - up display on a video game , which allows you to be informed without averting your eyes from the task at hand			1
' early prototypes of the glasses			2

firm claims glasses are ' fashion *friendly* '
hope to take on @entity26 in the wearable market
design *integrates* display into the lens
