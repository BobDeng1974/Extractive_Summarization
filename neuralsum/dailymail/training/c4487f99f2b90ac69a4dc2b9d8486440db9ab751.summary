battle : @entity1 died at the age of 27 from lung cancer			1
she had a transplant to try and save her from cystic fibrosis she delayed her wedding for two years while she waited for a lung transplant to save her from the cystic fibrosis that had claimed her brother ’s life			2
the operation was a success , and last autumn an overjoyed @entity1 walked down the aisle to marry her boyfriend of four years , @entity16			1
less than a year later , mrs @entity1 was dead , killed by cancer which her family are certain came from the donated lungs – which they found out , too late , had belonged to a 20 - a - day smoker			1
mr @entity23 says there is no way that his wife , who died in august at the age of 27 , would ever have agreed to the transplant had she known the lungs came from a smoker			1
along with his wife ’s parents , mr @entity23 , 28 , is now campaigning for more non-smokers to register as organ donors , to prevent other families going through the same agony			0
while it is easy to assume that only pristine organs are used in transplants , a severe shortage of donors means that almost 40 per cent of lungs used in the operations come from donors who have smoked			2
research shows that a seriously ill patient is much more likely to die from turning down a transplant than from accepting lungs donated by a smoker			1
@entity50 - born mrs @entity1 was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at the age of two			1
the disease , in which the lungs and digestive system become clogged with thick , sticky mucus , is hereditary			2
it claimed the life of her older brother , @entity60 , when he was just 23			0
mrs @entity1 met her future husband through friends in 2007			1
by the time they got engaged in 2009 , her health had deteriorated badly and the couple decided to delay the wedding in the hope she would get a transplant			2
after an 18 - month wait , she was told in april of last year that a pair of lungs were available			1
she gave her consent to the transplant after a doctor ran through the risks			2
a few weeks before her operation , transplant guidelines had been revised to say that patients should be informed if their new lungs carried a higher than normal risk of cancer			1
celebration : @entity1 with husband @entity84 and close family members following their wedding in @entity87 2011			1
the couple had delayed the ceremony by two years while she waited for the transplant write caption here but mrs @entity1 was treated under the previous rules , and was not told that the lungs had come from a 20 - a - day smoker			1
mr @entity23 , who works in @entity95 , told the @entity96 : ‘ that would have been the time to say , “ the donor was a smoker , therefore there is a higher risk of malignancy			0
do you want to go ahead or not ? ” ‘ they did n’t mention it			0
if they had , she would have said no. ’ the transplant , which was carried out at the @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity111 , appeared to be a success and the couple married a few months later			0
mr @entity23 said : ‘ weddings are always happy but this was something else			0
love : @entity16 and @entity1 were engaged in july 2009			2
prior to the proposal @entity16 sought permission from @entity1 's father who made sure @entity16 understood exactly what this commitment meant in this picture ( left ) from 2007 , @entity1 showed her own daily routine of medication a few months later , however , her happiness was shattered when she was diagnosed with lung cancer			1
it was only then that she was told her new lungs had belonged to a smoker			2
mr @entity23 is adamant that they were the source of the cancer			0
she died at home in @entity133 , @entity50 , on august 24			0
her father , @entity134 , 57 , said : ‘ yes , she had a fantastic wedding day but her death was horrible			0
‘ i would have given up the good times not to see her die like that			0
’ ( @entity141 ) @entity1 as a proud bridesmaid for the first time aged 11 - years - old in 1996			1
( right ) aged two , when her condition was diagnosed along with his wife and son - in - law , mr @entity60 has now set up a @entity148 page called @entity149 to encourage more non-smokers to register as organ donors			0
mr @entity60 says he wants those who have waited years for a transplant to have the choice his daughter never had			0
he told the @entity156 : ‘ all we want is to give @entity1 what she would have wanted			2
people need to be given more information			0
there must be more choice and more transparency			0
’ the @entity164 and @entity165 said it extended its sincere condolences to the family			0
a spokesman added that while it was ‘ very rare ’ for patients to specify they do not want lungs from smokers , mrs @entity1 should have had the choice			1
he said that research shows that a patient ’s chance of survival is higher if they receive a smoker ’s lungs than if they remain on the waiting list for a transplant from a donor with no history of smoking			1
he added : ‘ regrettably , the number of lungs available for transplantation would fall by 40 per cent if there was a policy of refusing those which have come from a smoker ; waiting lists would increase and many more patients would die without a transplant			1
’ @entity196 , which runs the organ donor register , said that all organs are examined at least twice before being transplanted and although the risks are very small , they are impossible to eliminate .			0

@entity1 was given the lungs of a 20 - a - day smoker

@entity207 says she would never have agreed to transplant had she known
