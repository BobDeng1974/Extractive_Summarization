i ’ve been wanting to play for @entity3 or in @entity16			1
bat in hand : @entity1 poses for the cameras with a cricket bat outside the @entity23 studios in @entity24 looking ahead : @entity1 is hoping to play county cricket for @entity3 when he retires from athletics ‘ i run in so fast and with my strong shoulders you know , i want to see how quick i am through the air			1
i ’m going to get it measured			1
’ @entity1 said he hoped to watch @entity31 take on @entity32 in the @entity33 at @entity34 after he bids to break his training partner @entity37 ’s world 150 metres record at the @entity38 in @entity24 on saturday afternoon			1
‘ i might swing by , ’ he said			1
‘ i would love to see @entity39 in action			2
there ’s @entity42 and @entity39 is not playing because of a little knee injury ! ‘ he ’s a dangerous guy			2
i remember him come to the @entity10 in 2005			2
i think i was in school and that guy was so dominant			2
i look up to him			2
i really look up to him as like his aggression and temperament			2
’ on the podium : @entity1 ( left ) won silver medals in both the 100m and 200m at the @entity52 heading north ? @entity1 is keen to take part in the @entity54 in @entity55 this summer the sprinter , who missed last season ’s world championships with a hamstring injury , said he has still yet to reach his peak and is targeting breaking his 100 metres personal best of 9.69secs this season , while @entity37 ’s world record of 9.58secs is not ‘ untouchable ’			1
@entity1 said : ‘ this is a good year to return to top form			1
when i came on the scene in 2009 i ’ve been leaving personal bests every end of the year so you might see one this year			1
‘ if i break the world record it ’s my time			0
@entity37 ’s had his time , and is still having it			0
whatever i do this season i just want to give a surprise to the world			0
my potential is far greater than what i ’m running now			0
‘ i would n’t say @entity37 ’s record is untouchable			0
scientists have proven that the human body could n’t go faster than 9.7secs , but we have raised the bar			0
i think it ’s touchable			0
’ @entity87 sprinting has come under scrutiny in recent weeks , with high profile athletes such as @entity90 and @entity91 both banned for doping offences , but @entity1 insisted he is happy to run against former drug cheats and can ‘ beat them clean ’			1
track and field : @entity1 could go from competing in athletics venues like @entity99 's @entity98 ... anyone for cricket ? ... to playing county cricket at @entity104 grounds like @entity11 in @entity105 beat them clean : @entity1 says he is happy to race the likes of @entity91 and @entity90 who have served drugs bans the @entity5 , who served a three - month ban in 2009 after testing positive for methylxanthine , a substance that was not initially on the @entity116 ’s banned list , said : ‘ it ’s bad but i close my mind from it because i do n’t want to hear nothing about it			1
‘ there ’s always a little bit of concern in your mind ( what people think about all sprinters ) , but you know what you can do and how strong and positive you are on the track , so you do n’t worry about it			0
of course you can believe what you ’re seeing on the track			0
‘ @entity90 is coming back soon and i ’m happy			0
i love running with him			0
he ’s a great competitor			0
whatever he does i ’m ready			0
i can beat them clean			0
