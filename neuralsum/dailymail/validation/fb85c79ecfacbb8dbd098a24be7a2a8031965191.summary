it is always satisfying to get a beautiful picture of a landscape , mountain or lake that you have visited			0
@entity6 , however , takes dedication to the next level by photographing @entity10 's @entity9 every day during summer , and experimenting with paragliding to capture its reflective surface from different angles			1
the lake is situated in the @entity15 and is the largest permanent lake in @entity10 , perfectly mirroring the surrounding mountains in its waters			1
reflective beauty : the stunning @entity9 in @entity10 is less well - known than the popular @entity21 , and is in pristine condition due to the lack of tourists @entity9 's orientation results in fascinating light which is perfect for capturing its surrounding mountains and reflections the 14th century church on the lake is featured on the coat of arms of the @entity33 and makes for a beautiful keepsake picture @entity6 captures @entity9 every day during summer , working at the local tourist information office during that period to be closer @entity9 is not as famous as popular tourist destination , @entity21 , but the lack of visitors allows the area to maintain its pristine condition			1
photographer @entity6 , 23 , became so spellbound by @entity9 that during summers he now works for the local tourist association in order to be closer to photograph it , as he lives 30 minutes away			1
' i was amazed that every day there was something different at the lake , be it light , clouds , fog , reflections or different colors of the leaves , ' he said			2
' secondly , i love symmetry and taking reflection shots and @entity9 surrounded with mountains is perfect for that			2
' taking to the skies ! @entity6 enjoys capturing the lake from all angles , including capturing reflections of the clouds while paragliding to photograph the lake from varied perspectives , @entity6 has even gone so far as climbing to the top of nearby waterfall @entity68 the lake is situated in the @entity15 and is the largest permanent lake in @entity10 the @entity10 's interest in photography started when he received his first digital slr camera , his father 's @entity73 @entity6 now uses a @entity75 with the @entity76 18 - 105mm and 12 - 24mm lenses to capture the stunning @entity10 lake the agronomy student , 23 , is currently doing a master thesis on visualization of root growth using @entity84 technique , but hopes to do something professionally that 's connected with photography			1

one of his most challenging shots occurred following a climb down a stone wall to get to the @entity102 waterfall			0
however , the resulting photograph was one that only a true artist would have been able to create			0
but for @entity106 , the best photograph that he has taken of the body of water was while flying above , thanks to the spectacular reflection of the clouds on the lake			0
his photography can be followed on @entity115 and @entity116 .			0

@entity6 , 23 , photographed the *790* - acre lake every day during the summer using *numerous* methods
