@entity2 's government has pushed the country into an economic crisis by not tackling its financial problems fast enough , former finance minister @entity0 has said @entity2 's government has pushed the country into an economic crisis by not tackling its financial problems fast enough , former finance minister @entity0 has said			1
his comments came as the central bank bailed out its first victim of the collapsing currency and authorities announced a tax on grain exports to protect domestic stocks			1
a poll of 11 economists also predicted that @entity2 's gross domestic product would fall 3.6 per cent next year			1
@entity2 has been hit by what economy minister @entity18 recently called a ' perfect storm ' of plummeting oil prices , sanctions related to its military action in @entity25 , and a flight of investors ' capital			1
a lack of structural reforms has compounded the problem , making the economy overwhelmingly dependent on oil revenues			0
@entity0 , one of few to criticise president @entity34 , said he believed the decline in the rouble could be attributed primarily to the sanctions , imposed following @entity2 's annexation of @entity25 's @entity39 region and its subsequent support for loyalist fighters in the east			1
in a move to contain the ruble crisis , the government today instructed five of the country 's biggest state - controlled exporters to reduce their foreign currency assets to october levels and to not raise them again until march			1
the companies targeted were gas giant @entity52 , oil companies @entity53 and @entity55 and diamond producers @entity56 and @entity58			0
today the ruble was steady as it has been for the past few trading sessions , floating around the 55 mark against the dollar			0
that 's certainly an improvement on last week when the ruble plunged at one point to near 80 against the dollar			0
with retailers , particularly of imported products , looking to pass costs onto consumers in light of the ruble 's fall , jittery consumers rushed to buy cars and emptied shelves at electronics and home appliances stores to pre-empt the price rises			1
others besieged bank offices to withdraw their deposits and buy dollars or euros - the panic that raised the threat of a full - fledged banking crisis if it 's not contained quickly			2
in response to the falling ruble , @entity2 's central bank last week increased its key interest rate to a whopping 17 per cent			1
though that may help ease the selling pressure on the ruble by encouraging traders to hold onto the currency in anticipation of big returns , it is going to hobble @entity2 businesses and households			2
' @entity2 prime minister @entity103 promised that the interest rate will be reduced once the ruble stabilizes , but acknowledged that the country faces the risk of a ' deep recession			1
' @entity103 said @entity2 's current economic difficulties were exacerbated by @entity106 sanctions			1
he said the economy is in a worse place now than in the 2008 crisis because ' a number of countries are effectively hampering the development of our economy			0
' he said : ' there are hopes to turn @entity2 into a pariah and reduce it to lower ranks in the ratings			2
' @entity34 discussed the @entity25 crisis with the leaders of @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity25 by telephone yesterday , the @entity137 said , noting that a ceasefire had largely held in eastern @entity25 in recent days			2
it said the leaders had emphasised the importance of removing heavy weapons and exchanging prisoners , but gave no indication of whether a breakthrough had been reached			0
government officials have tried to minimise the impact of sanctions on the country and its currency , which plunged 80 per cent against the dollar last week despite a hike in interest rates to 17 per cent			1
@entity34 has claimed ' external factors ' like oil were the key factor behind the country 's ' tough times '			0
@entity0 warned that @entity2 risked having its debt downgraded to junk status in 2015			2
he said : ' we have entered or are entering a real , full - fledged economic crisis			0
next year we will feel it clearly			0
@entity34 , seen above during a @entity2 press conference last week , discussed the @entity25 crisis with the leaders of @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity25 by telephone yesterday , the @entity137 said			2
it said the leaders had emphasised the importance of removing heavy weapons and exchanging prisoners , but gave no indication of whether a breakthrough had been reached			0
' the government has not been quick enough to address the situation ... i am yet to hear ... its clear assessment of the current situation			0
' @entity0 quit in 2011 in protest at proposals to increase defence spending , although he and @entity34 are still believed to be close			0
mounting evidence suggested that @entity2 's economic pain and isolation were starting to bite			1
the country announced plans to impose a heavy tax on grain exports since rouble volatility and high global prices have caused exports to spike : and @entity2 's central bank said it would have to bail out mid-sized @entity193 with 30 billion roubles ( £ 347 million ) to stop it going bankrupt			1
the country 's largest lender @entity195 was forced to deny a report from @entity199 news agency that it had suspended taking new requests for auto loans and mortgages			0
though @entity2 's biggest oil firm @entity53 partially eased some worries by saying it had made a £ 4.5 billion debt repayment from its own cash reserves - investors had been concerned it could default because the sanctions cut off its access to @entity106 finance			1
it announced separately that a deal to acquire an oil trading business from @entity213 had been terminated due to a refusal by regulators in the @entity216 to clear it			0
@entity2 has been hit by what economy minister @entity18 recently called a ' perfect storm ' of plummeting oil prices , sanctions related to its military action in @entity25 , and a flight of investors ' capital			1
a lack of structural reforms has compounded the problem , making the economy overwhelmingly dependent on oil revenues the termination of the deal is another blow for @entity53 after its partners including @entity234 withdrew from projects to develop @entity237 offshore oil deposits after the sanctions were introduced			0
@entity0 forecast a series of defaults among both medium and large companies , though he said banks would probably be supported by the state which was likely to result in rating agencies downgrading @entity2 's debt to ' junk ' status			2
the rouble firmed against the dollar yesterday , with exporters responding to @entity34 's urge to sell their foreign currency revenues on the market , and @entity254 crude prices stood close to £ 38 a barrel			1
while the currency , down some 45 per cent against the dollar so far this year , may stabilise in the first quarter of next year , its decline will likely help to push inflation to a rate of 12 - 15 per cent in 2015 , @entity0 said			2
the central bank envisages next year 's inflation at around 8 per cent			1
economists have predicted it would be as high as 9.2 percent			0
@entity0 said he believed that between 25 and 35 per cent of the decline in the rouble could be attributed to sanctions			2
the rest , he said , was down to a stronger dollar and investors ' mistrust of @entity2 authorities and their actions			0
his outlook for the economy next year was bleak : even if the price of oil rose to £ 51 per barrel , gross domestic product was still likely to fall by more than 2 per cent in 2015 , @entity0 said			0
at £ 38 per barrel gdp would decline by 4 per cent or more , he added , echoing the central bank 's latest assessment , published last week .			1
