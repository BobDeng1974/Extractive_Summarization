by @entity0 seasoned cricket observers in @entity2 can be forgiven if they are scratching their heads and struggling to recognise many of the names in @entity6 ’s touring party			1
even us @entity8 fans barely know who some of the players are			2
this must be , by some distance , the most inexperienced @entity8 squad to have toured @entity2 for several decades			2
only three of them have played @entity17 here before , and they now find themselves facing a full five - match series in @entity2 for the first time since 1959			1
leaders : @entity6 coach @entity22 ( left ) and captain @entity23 in training ahead of the first test in fact the last occasion @entity6 played five tests against anyone was back in 2002 , when the grizzled old captain @entity23 was still three years away from his debut			1
it is a far cry from the collection of ‘ galacticos ’ – @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 et al – who last toured here in 2011			1
that ageing team , which arrived as the world no 1 , suffered the humiliation of a 4 - 0 whitewash that marked a violent end to the dominance of @entity6 ’s golden generation			1
if even that star - studded side capitulated so horribly in @entity49 conditions , then some may ask what hope there is for the current crop ? including that tour three years ago , @entity6 have been defeated in all of their last four away test series , losing 10 of the 12 matches played			1
little wonder then that the media - averse coach @entity22 , in one of the few pronouncements he will make all summer , was keen to label his charges as youthful and inexperienced underdogs			1
but the wily old strategist , who has been allowed to continue developing a new generation of players despite the sequence of poor results , also raised the suggestion ‘ they might fire from this series ’ onwards			2
the new star : @entity71 typifies the loud and brash nature of the modern @entity6 while he was careful not to mention it , he has no doubt taken huge encouragement from @entity2 ’s own dreadful tally of losing six of their last seven tests			1
in reality , this is a series between two rather weak sides that are still struggling to reinvent themselves after the sudden loss of several very fine players , whether through retirement , ill - health or ill - discipline			2
and the main cause of @entity6 ’s torment three years ago – a disciplined and relentless bowling unit led by @entity90 at the peak of his powers – is looking nothing like the force it was back then			1
at the very least , there should be enough strength in @entity6 ’s traditional virtue – its batting – to avoid a repeat of the 2011 whitewash			1
their first aim will be to avert defeat in the opening two tests at @entity107 and @entity108 ’s , where the bowling conditions are often very much to @entity2 ’s liking			2
as the series goes on , and if we do indeed experience the long and hot summer tentatively promised by weather forecasters , then the pitches will become more like the dustbowls the @entity8 know back home			0
legends : @entity35 and @entity36 ( right ) were the bedrock of @entity6 's fearsome batting line - up the batting hopes will rest , in particular , on the shoulders of two men who may eventually go some distance towards emulating the great names they have succeeded			1
@entity126 , a classical technician who looks like he was born to play test cricket , is the natural heir to @entity36 in the no 3 slot			1
with a batting average close to 60 from his 19 tests , he has scored centuries against all five nations he has faced , including an unbeaten double hundred against @entity2			2
while @entity126 is something of a throwback to a bygone era , the other key batsman – @entity71 – typifies the brash and loud nature of modern @entity6			1
like several of his colleagues , he was a multi-millionaire and domestic celebrity before he had even played a single test match - purely on the back of some big hitting in @entity144 and the @entity145			0
many traditionalists probably took quiet satisfaction when @entity71 initially struggled in the longer and more difficult form of the great game			0
but despite his rather blingy outward appearance , he has a furious work ethic and his @entity17 average is now in the high 40s and still rising			0
he is starting to become a worthy holder of the number four slot vacated by @entity35 ’s retirement			0
born to play test cricket : @entity126 is the natural heir to @entity36 there is also considerable talent elsewhere in the batting line - up , at least on the evidence of shorter forms of cricket , although it has yet to prove itself consistently in the five - day version			1
the openers @entity168 and @entity169 have shown genuine signs of promise , but they failed to post a single stand of 50 in their last eight attempts			0
the recall of veteran opener @entity175 , whose last international appearance was 18 months ago , indicates all is not right at the top of the @entity8 order			0
lower down the order the stylish @entity179 , who scored centuries in his first two @entity17 innings , deserves to keep his place despite a subsequent dip in form			0
@entity185 and the spinning all - rounder @entity186 have also shown they can perform if handed the final batting slot			0
but to raise their ambitions and actually win a match or two , @entity6 will have to take 20 wickets			2
and it is here that the weaknesses in the squad really begin to show			0
in their warm - up matches they failed to make proper inroads into the batting line - up of not only @entity200 but also a @entity202 side placed second bottom in the second division that chose to field many 2nd @entity206 players			0
the @entity8 pace attack , if it can be so called , will be led in the experience stakes by the shaggy - haired beanpole @entity210			0
he is accurate and generates good bounce but is yet to develop into a true match - winner and fulfil the huge promise he showed as a teenage debutant			0
the more likely source of wickets is @entity218 , who has demonstrated in his six @entity17 that he has a precise radar and can move the ball – attributes suited to bowling in @entity2			2
his new - ball partner @entity222 has similar qualities and also the useful knack of taking early wickets when there is plenty of swing in the air , but perhaps lacks the pace to do damage once the cherry has lost its shine			0
spine of the team : @entity6 's @entity236 receives a back massage during the nets session there is serious speed , however , in the form of @entity242 , who has regularly been clocked above 90mph			1
nobody puts him in the shade : @entity71 is @entity6 's main man with the bat he can also trouble batsmen with movement if he lands the ball in the right place			1
the only problem is that he does n’t do so very often			0
much may depend on whether @entity22 – so familiar with @entity49 conditions – can get these and any other seamers he uses to capitalise on whatever help there is from the pitches and climate			1
it is difficult to forecast how much @entity22 will use the lead spinner , @entity261 , particularly in the opening matches			0
while often deadly at home , he failed to take a single wicket and conceded 108 runs in the sole away test away he was selected for , in @entity267 , in the last two years			0
the lack of penetration and experience among the bowlers means @entity6 may choose to adopt a cautious and realistic approach for much of the series rather than going for all - out attack			1
on their recent winter tours to @entity267 and @entity277 , they got into several winning positions and competed until the end before ultimately losing both series 1 - 0			0
they will probably be pleased with their summer ’s work if a similar pattern is repeated in @entity2			0
but the victory of a similarly unheralded @entity288 team in the two - test series last month shows there are rewards on offer for holding greater ambition and optimism			2
if they manage to weather the seamer - friendly conditions of the first two tests and go into the final games with a fighting chance of a series victory , then @entity6 may yet prevail in what is likely to be a tight battle between two young sides still undergoing a process of transition .			2

@entity49 fans will not be able to recognise some of @entity6 's players
@entity35 and @entity36 have been *replaced* by @entity71 and @entity126
@entity2 's bowling attack are *n't* the force they were in 2011 whitewash
captain @entity23 is the link between then and now for @entity6
@entity288 's recent series win gives @entity6 hope
@entity6 coach @entity22 , formerly of @entity2 , will be key for tourists
