@entity0 plans to start for the @entity1 against the @entity2 at @entity3 , at least temporarily putting an end to questions about @entity7 ’s quarterback situation			1
head coach @entity8 has n’t said @entity0 would be the starter but the third - year quarterback insisted that where he stands has been made clear to him			1
he has taken all of the snaps with the first team			1
‘ i ’ve been preparing to play @entity2 in @entity17 and to go out there and win , ’ said @entity0 , who has completed just 56.5 percent of his passes and ranks 29th in the @entity15 in passer rating at 74.1			1
‘ i ’m taking the first snap of the game and playing the game			1
’ @entity1 quarterback @entity0 ( 17 ) looks to pass as he is pursued by @entity21 outside linebacker @entity22 ( 50 ) @entity8 ’s approach has created a distraction in the locker room , and @entity0 said that was an issue and was not a good feeling for him			1
but @entity0 said he understood @entity8 ’s handling of the situation , and remains confident in his abilities and the potential of @entity7 ’s offense			1
‘ obviously , it does n’t feel good			2
it creates a bunch of stir and a bunch of distraction in the locker room , mostly from the outside coming in , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ just guys having to deal with the distraction of it , it ’s not a good feeling but he ’s been clear with me and i know where i stand			2
i do n’t know how it first came to me			2
i think i received some texts from basically everyone i ’ve ever known offering me support , which is a good thing i guess , and then coach came to me			2
’ backup quarterback @entity51 confirmed that nothing has changed with his role and that he has not taken a snap with the first team since training camp			1
‘ i ’ve taken zero reps			0
@entity0 ’s prepared the same way he always does and i ’ve prepared the same way i always do , ’ said @entity51 , who is the highest paid backup quarterback in the league and won six games as a starter for @entity7 in 2011			1
@entity0 hits the ground after being brought down by @entity21 outside linebacker @entity65 ‘ we showed up on tuesday and everything was the same			0
obviously , i did get a couple of text messages from friends who read things and it caught me off guard but nothing was said in here			0
’ the quarterbacks ’ lockers are near each other and they are together in the position meetings and on the practice field			0
@entity51 did n’t notice any difference in @entity0 ’s demeanor this week			1
with the @entity1 trying to avoid going into the bye week at 1 - 3 , @entity0 understands the importance of this game with @entity2 and he feels like he has the full support of his teammates			1
he spoke confidently about the running game and the offensive line , while saying he wished @entity8 had handled it differently			0
‘ does it feel good to deal with all the distractions that have been created because of the situation ? no , ’ @entity0 said			0
you face adversity in life and you have to be able to handle it			0
‘ you have to be able to fight through it and become a better man , become a better player because of it			0
we ’re going about our normal week			0
it ’s all this stuff on the outside that seems like the world ’s collapsing			0
i think the guys are confident , not only in their abilities but in mine			0
