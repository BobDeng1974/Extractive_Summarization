by @entity0 and @entity1 clampdown : @entity2 is to target radical mosques where terror suspects being monitored under control laws will be banned from worshipping the home secretary is to draw up a list of radical mosques where terror suspects being monitored under controversial control measures will be banned from worshipping			1
the crackdown follows the escape of a suspect who went on the run after attending a mosque in @entity16 and leaving disguised in a burka			1
terror suspects on @entity19 and @entity20 ( @entity21 ) , which replaced control orders in 2012 , also face restrictions on the amount of time they spend in mosques			1
and police and @entity29 officials will be told to move suspects away from their communities to other parts of their home cities			1
where there is greater risk of absconding , suspects will be given longer curfews and made to report to police stations more frequently			2
@entity39 , 29 , who is accused of being part of terrorist cell targeting @entity43 interests , is still at large after fleeing a mosque in @entity16 on november 1 dressed in a burka			0
the @entity29 crackdown comes as @entity47 can reveal there are now seven terror suspects on the run after evading the @entity52 ’s strict control laws			1
the @entity54 men all escaped over the last eight years while being monitored by @entity55 and the police			2
most are believed to be abroad fighting with @entity58 extremist groups			0
sources said home secretary @entity2 was dismayed by the escapes of @entity39 and another suspect last year and is seeking to ‘ significantly strengthen ’ conditions placed on suspects			1
she has asked @entity55 and @entity64 what measures are necessary but they are expected to include restricting access of @entity21 suspects to specific mosques and limiting the time spent in those mosques they are permitted to attend			1
the list of banned mosques is likely to include a number that have caused concern by hosting speakers with radical views in recent years			1
the home secretary will also tell the security services that @entity21 suspects can be moved from one part of a city to another in an attempt to disrupt their support networks			2
mrs may also wants to increase the number of times a day suspects have to report to police stations and to lengthen overnight curfews to the legal maximum of 10 hours			2
on the run : @entity39 is still at large after fleeing a mosque in @entity16 on november 1 dressed in a burka previous measures , known as control orders , included the ability to relocate suspects from one part of the country to another , along with curfews of up to 16 hours but were watered down on the insistence of @entity104			1
emergency powers could be introduced but sources say the home secretary is instead making it clear she wants the police and security services to make sure ‘ every available power is being used to its fullest extent ’			0
‘ this is an operational matter for the police and security services but we want them to use all the powers at their disposal , ’ the source said			0
‘ at the same time , we accept that unless they are behind bars there will not be a perfect solution			0
’ @entity125 , the government ’s former independent reviewer of terrorism laws , said the current @entity21 regime introduced last year made it possible for suspects to abscond			0
he said : ‘ the government did n’t listen to our concerns			0
by not allowing the suspects to be relocated to other parts of the country , it made it easier for them to abscond			0
’ the @entity47 can disclose that @entity39 was described in court papers as being ‘ deeply involved in the terrorism - related activity ’ of a @entity52 - based network and was suspected of procuring weapons for terrorist attacks which were to include the @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147			0
he has access to false passports , documentation and money and is seeking to join three members of his network who are still at large in @entity147 with @entity154 , the group behind the @entity156 shopping centre massacre			0
