inventor @entity1 's sleek and futuristic ghost warship is all revved up with no place to go			1
the angular vessel looks like a waterborne stealth x-wing fighter from @entity6			1
it rides atop underwater torpedo - shaped tubes powered by a pair of 2,000 - horsepower gas turbine engines			1
gyroscopes keep the ride smooth			0
despite all of its cutting - edge bells and whistles , ghost might never be a familiar household name like @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 -- even if it works as advertised -- because its creator built a warship the military is not convinced it needs			2
now he just need to find a buyer ‘ it 's a revolutionary program , ’ said @entity1 , founder and ceo of @entity38			1
‘ nothing like this has ever been built by anybody , not even the @entity43			2
’ the ghost rides on 12 - foot - tall struts connected to engine assemblies @entity1 says take advantage of ‘ supercavitation , ’ traveling underwater inside a bubble of gas			1
it is a new application of technology that the inventor insists will make ghost fast -- it 's so far hit about 35mph but its creator believes it can approach 60mph -- while staying stable even in rough seas			2
but @entity1 has taken the usual step of spending $ 15million on a prototype that he hopes to sell to the @entity43 , turning upside down a process in which normally the military identifies a need before soliciting proposals and seeking funding			1
‘ the @entity43 is pretty skeptical of what we 've been working on but they 're starting to take us more seriously , ’ said @entity1 , whose company operates out of a leased warehouse at the @entity29			1
@entity1 , who as a young man raced hydroplanes , came up with the design for the 60 - foot - long vessel after terrorists using a small boat full of explosives nearly sank the @entity74 in 2000			1
sleek : the angular vessel looks like a waterborne stealth x-wing fighter from @entity6 riding atop underwater torpedo - shaped tubes powered by a pair of 2,000 - horsepower gas turbine engines cutting edge : the ghost 's inventor says the vessel 's smooth ride makes it an ideal platform for weapon systems -- and for transporting @entity88 , but the @entity43 is skeptical inspired idea : @entity1 came up with the innovative design for the 60 - foot - long vessel after terrorists using a small boat full of explosives nearly sank the @entity74 in 2000 he thinks the @entity43 needs a fast patrol boat to protect larger and more costly warships when they 're most vulnerable , like when they 're passing through the @entity97 at the southern end of the @entity99			1
the ghost 's smooth ride makes it an ideal platform for weapon systems -- and for transporting @entity88 , @entity1 said			2
the 38 - foot long main cabin rests on top of a pair of 12 - foot tall struts which , when moving at speed , prop the cabin above the water like a hydrofoil			1
the struts swivel at their base , allowing them to be raised and lowered depending on the water depth			0
while parked , or traveling through shallow waters , they can be extended to the side			0
in deeper waters , at speeds of eight knots or higher , they can rotate downward to lift the hull into the air , eliminating the jarring impact of waves			0
they 're sharpened along the leading edge as well to slice through submerged debris			0
at the other end of each strut , a 62 - foot long tube houses a @entity133 gas turbine engine spinning two front - mounted propellers			1
these tubes also eject a pocket of air from the front to generate a supercavitation effect that reduces the ship 's drag coefficient by a factor of 900			0
@entity143 has been used to produce high - speed torpedoes but @entity1 said he is adapted it for the first time to propel a surface warship			2
as part of his design , dual propellers were moved to the front instead of the rear and underwater ailerons control the vessel , which banks like an airplane when it 's turning			2
sadly for @entity1 , the @entity43 currently does not have a requirement for such a patrol boat , said @entity158 , spokesman for the @entity159			1
but the innovative design is at least worth a look , even if it turns out to be unfit for military use , according to retired vice adm. @entity163 , ceo of the @entity164 , an independent , nonpartisan organization in @entity165 , @entity166			2
‘ the high ground for the @entity43 is to take this and evaluate it and learn from it , ’ @entity163 said			0
‘ the propulsion system could be valuable in other applications			0
you 've got to keep that door open to innovation , ’ he said			0
@entity1 insists the military has expressed at least some interest in his company , which counts retired @entity43 admirals and one former @entity181 senator , @entity180 of @entity182 , as board members			1
‘ any time you 're building something so different , you 're going to find people that just do n't understand it			0
you 've really got to spend some time understanding what 's going on here , ’ @entity1 said			0
even in the best of times , the @entity43 tends to buy larger , multi-missions ships instead of smaller niche vessels			0
and the @entity43 's current budget struggles pose perhaps the biggest obstacle			0
look 's familiar ? @entity1 's ghost bears an uncanny resemblance to the x-wing fighter from @entity6 @entity1 is also proposing marketing his vessel to other navies and wants to build a new version that 'll be a bit bigger			1
he believes it will be flexible enough for other tasks , like anti-submarine and mine warfare operations			0
@entity207 , a defense analyst at the @entity208 , said the small company faces an uphill battle			0
the @entity43 's speedy new littoral combat ships are designed to fulfill the @entity26 's proposed mission , and @entity207 is skeptical that the @entity43 would be willing to go out on a limb for all - new design for a ship that 's too small and light to accommodate heavy armor and bigger weapon systems			1
@entity219 needs plenty of money , and perhaps a friend or two in @entity224 , he said , to circumvent an acquisition process that poses obstacles for small startups like @entity219 , which has 15 employees .			0

@entity1 , founder and ceo of @entity38 , built angular vessel resembling a waterborne stealth fighter he *dubbed* ' ghost
it rides atop underwater torpedo - shaped tubes powered by a pair of 2,000 - horsepower gas turbine engines
inventor hopes to sell his design to the @entity43 , but @entity244 says it has no need for it
creation of the 60 - foot - long vessel was inspired by *bombing* of @entity74 where terrorists used a small boat full of explosives
