by @entity0 these captivating images of a breathtaking seaside villa may look like they 're computer generated , but they are pure unadulterated architectural reality			2
nestled in @entity6 's cliff - side , the work of architectural art by @entity10 design duo @entity9 and @entity11 of @entity12 has a ' seamless flow ' between the natural beauty outside and the stunning modern interior			1
with its jaw - dropping architecture , including a triple volume gallery in the main living area , uninterrupted sea and mountain views and utterly lust - worthy interiors , it 's no wonder the property has caught the attention of interior fans around the globe , including @entity28 's property blogger @entity27			1
the incredible villa has a split - level living area , a three - story high gallery and 270 degree views of the @entity33 and beyond ' many of my clients own superb beach houses or water - front apartments , but this residential home is something of a marvel , ' she says of the house , which has panoramic views of @entity6 's iconic @entity45 , some the world 's most beautiful , and the calming waves of the @entity33			1
' i love the triple volume gallery space they have created inside and praise how the master bedroom floats over into the double volume living space with a striking soft s - curve cantilever			2
' ' to the rear of the site you can sit and enjoy the mountains			0
this level enjoys 270 degree views from @entity61 at the rear to the @entity63 on the @entity64 and the dramatic sea views over the @entity67 beaches to the @entity68 , ' she adds			2
the garden is designed to be protected from infamous @entity6 wind , but still has incredible views of the dramatic landscape kick back and relax : the natural tones and organic materials add to the laid back feel in the villa 's main lounge ' on speaking to the architects they told me how the brief was to create a building that maximised the connection with the view and the sea , create a garden on the mountain side of the site and to minimise views over neighbouring buildings			1
' i know their team has done this perfectly ! the pictures say it all , ' she says			0

as well as breathtaking architecture , the 1,624 metre square villa is furnished to perfection by @entity6 - based interior designer studio @entity103			2
rise and shine : light floods into the master bedroom and sets right in front of the bed a bird 's - eye - view of the main lounge with it 's high ceiling and 270 degree views ( left ) and the second bedroom ( right ) the bath is designed to feel like it 's on the water 's edge -- perfect for a relaxing soak ‘ the building provides a volumetrically dramatic and dynamic interior space on a grand scale , ' says @entity103 designer @entity122			1
' the objective of the interior décor was to create a softer and intimate counterpoint whilst not jeopardizing the clean , geometric lines of the architecture			0
' these elements can harmoniously co-exist and work off each other , ’ ' by utilising a broad base of textures and finishes , the décor feels natural and subtly organic , comfort being of paramount importance at all times ; the overall ambiance is one of calm and serenity			0
' colour is kept to a bare minimum , the interior works predominantly with a light and shade tonal range , allowing the exterior views , the mountain , the ocean and sky and also the artwork to bring in colour			0
' with floor - to - ceiling windows from wall - to - wall , it 's not a bad spot to watch the sunset from every angle the cliff - side property takes in the lush surroundings - mountains , gardens , beaches and sea in the foyer of the mansion there 's a glass elevator and a sweeping staircase , which take you to the airy living space			1
and of course , there 's a separate staff entrance too for butler , gardener , housekeeper , cook and anyone else you might want to invite along to make life a little easier			0
there ’s also an entire open level that can be used as a gym or games room as well as an elegant cinema room for private screenings			0
and of course you wo n't be feuding with your neighbours over parking spots			0
the sheltered garage can accommodate up to four large vehicles -- or even a small boat ! the @entity190 is available for rental or sale via via gray@filth.co.za			0
