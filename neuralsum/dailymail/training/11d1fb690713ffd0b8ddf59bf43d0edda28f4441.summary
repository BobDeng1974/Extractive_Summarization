ms @entity10 conceived triplets just a few weeks after @entity9 was born ms @entity5 , who lives with partner postal worker @entity11 in a one bedroom house said : ‘ falling pregnant so soon after having our baby was a real shock but to find out it was triplets knocked us for six			1
‘ having four babies under the age of one is going to be insane , but i can not wait to hold them in my arms			0
’ the babies will be delivered in nine weeks ’ time at the @entity26 in @entity27 when ms @entity5 is 34 weeks pregnant			1
at first the couple , from @entity29 , were told they were expecting three non-identical sons , but later scans revealed one of the babies was a girl			0
they have named their sons @entity38 and @entity39 and daughter @entity40			0

image shows a scan of the babies ‘ i ca n’t believe i ’ve gone from thinking i will never be a mum to giving birth to a perfect family in under a year			0
’ the couple started trying for a baby in september 2011 shortly after starting their relationship			0
as they had already been friends for years , there seemed little point in waiting to start the family they both dreamed of			0
but each month brought disappointment			0
ms @entity5 explains : ‘ it seemed everyone around us was becoming pregnant			1
i tried to be happy for them but could n’t help wondering when it would be my turn			0
’ when a year had passed with no joy ms @entity5 started to fear there might be something wrong and booked an appointment with her gp in september 2012			2
ms @entity5 said : ' i ca n't believe i 've gone from thinking i will never be a mum to giving birth to a perfect family in under a year ' but the week before her appointment , her period was late			1
she says : ‘ after waiting so long i did n’t get my hopes up			0
but i did a test anyway and was stunned to find out i was finally pregnant at last			0
’ the couple moved into their first home together – a one - bedroom privately rented house – as they awaited the arrival of their son			1
after a textbook pregnancy , @entity9 was born on june 1 last year			2
ms @entity5 said : ‘ @entity9 was such a perfect happy baby and we both loved being parents so much that we already decided we wanted another before we left hospital			1
’ the couple ( pictured before @entity9 was born ) feared they would be unable to have children as it took a year for them to conceive @entity9 but because it had taken her so long to conceive , ms @entity5 assumed the same would happen again			1
so when the couple made love again for the first time four weeks after @entity9 was born they did n’t use any contraception			1
one month later , ms @entity5 ’s period was late			2
she says : ‘ @entity11 laughed and made a joke about me being pregnant but of course neither of us really expected that			1
i thought it was just my hormones after the birth			0
’ but a week on she took a test which confirmed she was expecting again			0
ms @entity5 says the couple will struggle with space and money once the babies and born as they live in a one bedroom house			1
however , she says they will not be short of love @entity9 was just eight weeks old			1
she said : ‘ i was shaking			0
i was looking at the blue line on the stick and then at my tiny baby thinking this can not really be happening			0
’ mr @entity11 was equally stunned but the couple ’s shock soon gave way to excitement			2
mr @entity11 says : ‘ yes it was happening sooner than we thought but we both knew another baby would complete the family			1
’ ms @entity5 ’s bump grew rapidly and at first she put it down to becoming pregnant again so soon after having a baby			1
‘ i had n’t lost any of my baby weight from @entity9 and was pregnant again so i expected to be big , ’ she says			1
but weeks later her first scan revealed the shocking reason why her bump was so large			0
she says : ‘ i hopped onto the bed and lifted up my top			0
it was only a few months since i ’d been in getting scanned with @entity9 so i knew what to do			2
’ but this time the sonographer paused during the scan and asked the couple if they knew how many babies they were having			0
ms @entity5 says : ‘ it was an odd question			2
i ’d never been asked that with @entity9 so i thought it was weird			2
then i twigged what she was getting at and asked her if i was having twins			0
’ the sonographer shook her head and replied : ‘ triplets			0
’ ms @entity5 says : ‘ i just started shaking with shock and asking her if she was sure			2
@entity11 ’s mouth was hanging wide open			2
neither of us could speak			0
’ suddenly her huge baby bump made perfect sense			0
former care worker ms @entity5 says : ‘ when she turned the screen towards me i could see three wriggling little shapes and i just started to cry			2
i could n’t get my head around the fact there were three babies inside me as well as the one at home			0
’ when the due date was confirmed as april 28th 2014 ms @entity5 realised it meant she would have given birth to four babies in less than one year			1
ms @entity10 and mr @entity11 ( pictured when @entity9 was a week old ) say they feel very blessed she says : ‘ considering i thought i would n’t ever be a mum at one point , to then go to having four babies felt like a miracle			1
’ the couple both have twins in their families , but neither had considered a multiple birth			0
‘ i think because i had struggled to fall pregnant we never ever thought about twins let alone triplets , ’ ms @entity5 says			1
as the news sunk in she and mr @entity11 alternated between tears of shock and joy			2
the following week the couple were warned that being triplets put the babies at high risk of premature birth and were asked to consider terminating one			2
mr @entity11 says : ‘ there was no way we could choose one baby to die			1
it would have been impossible			0
we loved them all already			0
’ ms @entity5 says : ' i 'll be changing 40 nappies a day and making up to 20 bottles			1
it 's going to be manic ' with regular monitoring ms @entity5 ’s pregnancy progressed well			2
she says : ‘ i looked full term by 14 weeks and sometimes it feels like i ’m going to burst			0
‘ the heartburn with one was bad enough , but with three it ’s been horrendous			0
but it ’s all worth it			0
’ ms @entity5 is now 25 weeks pregnant			1
doctors plan to deliver the babies in nine weeks ’ time when she is 34 weeks pregnant			2
she ’s already expressing breast milk in preparation for their arrival , as well as stocking up on vests and baby grows			0
the couple are hoping the council will find them a bigger house when the babies have been born she says : ‘ i ’ll be changing 40 nappies a day and making up to 20 bottles			1
it ’s going to be manic			0
‘ @entity9 will only be nine months old with the triplets arrive			1
‘ unfortunately we will have to bring them back to our one bedroom house because the council can not offer us a three bedroom home until they have been born			1
‘ it ’s going to be very cramped with four babies in a one bedroom house until we move and i ’m disappointed that they can not offer us a properly earlier			1
‘ but we have amazing family and friends supporting us and we can not wait to meet our little miracles			0
‘ we ’ll be short of space and money with four babies under one – but we ’ll not be short on love			2

@entity5 , 28 , learnt she was pregnant with triplets , who are due to be delivered by c - section in march , when baby @entity9 was just eight weeks old
she struggled to conceive @entity9 so did n't use contraception after his birth
she says she is *delighted* but that she and her parter , @entity11 , will struggle for money and space as they live in a one bedroom house
the pair will be changing 40 nappies a day and making up to 20 bottles
