the @entity1 government has taken the first steps to licensing firms to mine the moon			1
according to documents obtained by @entity12 , @entity1 companies can stake claims to lunar territory through an existing licensing process for space launches			1
the @entity15 , in a previously undisclosed late - december letter to @entity14 , said the agency intends to ' leverage the @entity15 's existing launch licensing authority to encourage private sector investments in space systems by ensuring that commercial activities can be conducted on a non-interference basis			1
' the move would give firms exclusive rights to that territory - as well as related areasthat might be tapped for mining , exploration and other activities			1
@entity15 letter noted a concern flagged by the @entity32 that ' the national regulatory framework , in its present form , is ill - equipped to enable the @entity1 government to fulfill its obligations ' under a 1967 @entity39 treaty , which , in part , governs activities on the moon			1
the @entity39 @entity45 treaty , in part , requires countries to authorize and supervise activities of non-government entities that are operating in space , including the moon			1
it also bans nuclear weapons in space , prohibits national claims to celestial bodies and stipulates that space exploration and development should benefit all countries			1
in other words , experts said , @entity57 could set up one of its proposed inflatable habitats on the moon , and expect to have exclusive rights to that territory - as well as related areas that might be tapped for mining , exploration and other activities			2

' we did n't give ( @entity14 ) a license to land on the moon			2
' we 're talking about a payload review that would potentially be part of a future launch license request			0
' but it served a purpose of documenting a serious proposal for a @entity1 company to engage in this activity that has high - level policy implications , ' said the @entity15 letter 's author , @entity94 , associate administrator for the @entity15 's @entity96			0
' we recognize the private sector 's need to protect its assets and personnel on the moon or on other celestial bodies , ' the @entity15 wrote in the december letter to @entity14			2

@entity57 requested the policy statement from the @entity15 , which oversees commercial space transportation in the @entity1 the letter was coordinated with @entity1 departments of @entity111 , as well as @entity112 and other agencies involved in space operations			2
it expands the @entity15 's scope from launch licensing to @entity1 companies ' planned activities on the moon , a region currently governed only by the nearly 50 - year old @entity39 space treaty			1

the company intends to then operate free - flying orbital outposts for paying customers , including government agencies , research organizations , businesses and even tourists			0
that would be followed by a series of bases on the moon beginning around 2025 , a project estimated to cost about $ 12 billion			2
@entity137 founder @entity57 said he intends to invest $ 300 million of his own funds , about $ 2.5 billion in hardwareand services from @entity14 and raise the rest fromprivate investors			0

' it 's very much a wild west kind of mentality and approach right now , ' said @entity154 , chief executive of private owned @entity155 , a startup lunar transportation and services firm competing in a $ 30 million @entity157 - backed moon exploration xprize contest			2
among the pending issues is lunar property and mineral rights , a topic that was discussed and tabled in the 1970s in a sister @entity39 proposal called the @entity164			1
it was signed by just nine countries , including @entity167 , but not the @entity1			0
' it is important to remember that many space - faring nations have national companies that engage in commercial space activities			2

the @entity15 's decision ' does n't mean that there 's ownership of the moon , ' @entity57 told @entity12			0
' it just means that somebody else is n't licensed to land on top of you or land on top of where exploration and prospecting activities are going on , which may be quite a distance from the lunar station			0
