historians at the @entity27 said it was possible they have finally found his body during the excavation for the new @entity31 for @entity32 and @entity33 curator @entity34 said : ' a member of the public told us he had read that @entity8 was buried at @entity39 stables			1
' then , when the skeleton was discovered , it was a potential possibility			1
' where it was buried , it would make sense			2
doctor @entity8 was euthanised here in 1838			1
' it was a very careful digger driver that spotted the skeleton			1
it would be an amazing find if it turned out to be @entity8			1
' he was one of most consistent racehorses of his time			0
he went to stud here in 1824			0
he was a good sire as well as a great racehorse			2
doctor @entity8 was put down in 1838 but his exact resting place was never known despite his historic past the racehorse was born in @entity62 and won more than 36 races from 1814 to 1823 before retirement ' it could also be a royal racehorse			1
its location does not suggest it was n't			0
it makes you think what else is there to find			0
' archaeologist @entity74 , of @entity75 , said he was not convinced the skeleton was that of @entity8 due to the age of the horse 's teeth			1
the horse is believed to have been 28 when he died but mr @entity74 puts the mystery horse at 18 to 20 years old after examining its teeth			0
he said : ' there 's no trace of any other injuries on the skeleton			2
the skull was heavily smashed , which means i ca n't tell from it whether it was euthanised			0
' i 'm told that the preferred method from that period was a medium gauge shotgun behind the ear which would n't have done the skull lot of good anyway			0
it 's more than possible it was put to sleep			2
' it was certainly a racehorse , all the evidence points to that			2
i do n't think it could be @entity8 , but you would have to carry out dna tests to make sure			1
' it was in a specifically dug grave and was not just manhandled in			0
it could be a royal racehorse , but it is impossible to say for sure			2
' he revealed the racehorse was born in @entity62 and won more than 36 races from 1814 to 1823			1
mr @entity34 , who has been at the museum for 22 years , said he could not say whether it would become an exhibit and would consider carrying out a dna test			0
he welcomed anyone who has further information that could shed light on the identity of the horse to get in touch			0
the first royal residence in @entity16 was built in 1608 by @entity124 who found the nearby heath land ideal for horse racing and the first race was recorded in 1622			2
but racing was suppressed during the @entity129 as a calculated political act because race meetings were seen as an unwelcome opportunity for royalist gatherings			0
shortly after the restoration , @entity15 had the stables repaired or rebuilt by @entity136 in around 1664			2
the @entity137 stand opposite what remains of the racing palace of @entity15 @entity15 established the @entity140 in october 1665 which is still run to this day			0
