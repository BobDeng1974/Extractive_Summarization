by sunday evening , @entity1 time , @entity0 will have a new champion			1
whether it will have a credible future is another matter entirely			0
ideally , @entity6 will have driven first , or second , through the flag at the @entity8 just moments before			1
if @entity6 finishes top two — as he has done in the last six races — order will reign and the integrity of the event will be maintained			1
if @entity6 finishes lower — or worst - case scenario , not at all — a sport already beleaguered by courtroom battles and economic crisis will plunge towards its greatest controversy yet			1
fans will tolerate financial scandal , and complex legal battles leave them cold			0
fair play is a different matter			0
on occasions when @entity0 has attracted greatest negativity , a miscarriage of justice , an assault on basic fairness , has invariably been responsible			0
@entity30 crashed deliberately at the @entity31 to trigger the safety car and a win for his @entity35 team - mate @entity34 ; @entity36 was told to let @entity38 team - mate and no 1 driver @entity37 pass to win the @entity40 @entity31 in 2002			1
one act was close to fraudulent — but neither sat well with the public			0
@entity6 ( left ) and @entity44 will go head to head for the @entity48 ' championship this weekend @entity44 is 17 points behind @entity6 , but still stands a good chance thanks to the double points on offer the @entity54 pair have been nip and tuck all season long in their title battle title contender @entity44 enjoys a spot of keepy - up ahead of the season finale in @entity1 1			1
@entity6 - 334 points 2			1
@entity44 - 317 points @entity6 will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season - ending @entity65 , even if @entity44 wins the race			1
if the final race was a ‘ normal ’ race with 25 points for the winner , rather than the double points on offer , @entity6 would be able to claim his second drivers ’ title with a sixth - place finish			1
motor sport , we are told , is a team game , and @entity38 ’s desire to keep @entity37 on top was no different in essence to a football manager picking one player and dropping another for a big match			2
yet something about the instruction struck at the heart of ethical racing and team orders that directly influenced race positions were subsequently outlawed			2
if anything , sunday ’s grand finale represents an even greater threat to the status of @entity0			1
this time it is not an individual race that may be artificially adjusted but an entire season			2
there is a chance that @entity6 — who has 10 wins in 2014 , double that of any rival prior to @entity1 — might not claim the drivers ’ championship			1
the reason ? last race double points			1
for one day only , 25 first - place points become 50 , 18 second place points hike to 36			1
no decision on next year has been announced , but the practice is almost certain to be abandoned after this single season experiment			2
like all bad ideas , double points is an orphan			1
nobody is willing to take responsibility for it ; nobody claims to have brought it into the world			0
it was born , and will die , in this season			2
with luck it will not take the reputation of the sport with it			0
the @entity8 in @entity1 will host the final round of the 2014 season this weekend @entity6 signs autographs for spectators at the circuit in the @entity133 on thursday ‘ double the points , double the action , ’ is the sell here , but only half of that claim is true			1
@entity1 has double points , but the action is just the same			1
it is not as if the drivers go around twice for their bonus			2
if they did , it might make sense			0
as it is , double points is a rule change designed to thwart a man whose time was up anyway			1
@entity151 was dominating the sport when it was first mooted			0
bizarrely , this success was presumed to continue and double points was considered a way of slowing his procession while creating the potential for intrigue on the last day			1
it was hasty and an over-reaction			0
@entity151 is a distant fourth this year			0
he is so out of contention he is quitting @entity164 for @entity38 in time for 2015			0
the @entity0 bonus round is therefore akin to the @entity166 changing the points system to put the brakes on @entity169 — and introducing the measure to coincide with the arrival of @entity172			2
grand prix racing has always had a cavalier approach to scoring			0
relations between the pair have been strained this season due to a number of racing incidents @entity6 and @entity44 make contact at the @entity181 @entity31 at @entity182 in august it was not so long ago that teams were allowed to discount their worst race in the first half of the season			1
there also used to be smaller margins , as little as two points , between first and second			2
@entity190 claims his initial idea for double points involved three races carrying the incentive , not one , which would make more sense			1
bonus points for marquee events — the last race of the season , the @entity196 and one other ( @entity197 or @entity198 if influenced by history , @entity182 or @entity200 if judged on the test , @entity202 for the spectacle , @entity204 or @entity205 if @entity190 just farmed it out to the highest bidder ) — would not be a calamity			1
after all , not all tennis and golf tournaments are created equal , with bigger prize - money and prestige attached to events that bring the greatest pressure and athletic challenge			0
had there been three occasions this season when @entity0 had recognised a test of increased significance , this might have been hailed as a visionary move			0
instead , it looked like another @entity190 - inspired gimmick			0
@entity0 supremo @entity190 at the @entity8 on thursday @entity6 and @entity44 have been friends ever since their karting days race winner @entity6 on the podium with @entity44 at the @entity230 @entity231 backs @entity6 to clinch title @entity233 does not always have to be fair			1
indeed , one of its challenges is the way an individual or team reacts to the adversity of an official ’s lousy decision , a run of injuries or a technical failure			0
yet it can not be wantonly unjust			0
and if @entity6 — without doubt the driver of the season — ends up trailing his @entity54 team - mate @entity44 by some final - race fluke , it will be regarded as one of sport ’s great travesties			1
maybe this accounted for the tension in the room as the men sat on the top tier for thursday ’s pre-race press conference			0
they were separated by @entity260 of @entity261 and looked straight ahead , barely acknowledging each other save for a forced handshake for photographers			0
@entity44 initiated it , @entity6 responded , with barely a flicker of recognition			1
the interviews had been going roughly 23 minutes before he allowed even a half - smile			0
asked about driver etiquette with so much at stake , @entity6 ’s replies were clipped and the sentiments pointed			2
if @entity6 took @entity44 out at the first corner , the title would be his			1
he insisted he was not that type of driver ; @entity44 hardly offered confirmation of this statement			2
a young @entity6 and @entity44 riding unicycles together even without double points , the motivation for @entity6 to fight dirty would not change — yet the warped scoring system has given the whole event an unreal air			1
after 17 races , here comes a leap into the unknown			0
and @entity0 could do without another scandal			0
it occupies an awkward position in the modern psyche as it is — such conspicuous consumption against the backdrop of global recession			0
the @entity8 complex is a billionaire ’s playground			2
yachts bob in the harbour , the five - star hotel straddling the circuit is a design classic , the work of @entity305 and @entity306 of @entity307 in @entity308			0
meanwhile , in what resembled a deserted lot at the end of the paddock , the crowd - funded @entity310 team announced the recruitment of @entity317 , a 23 - year - old making his @entity0 debut in this final race			2
@entity310 entered administration in october and the man now in charge , @entity323 , said they had come to @entity1 only as a showcase for potential buyers			2
it is an irony that those at the far end of the leaderboard fight to be noticed			0
despite the predicted double action , what @entity0 could most do with this weekend is no alarms , no surprises and the natural order maintained .			0

@entity6 and @entity44 will go head to head for title on sunday
@entity340 leads his @entity54 team - mate by 17 points in drivers ' standings
double points on offer in @entity1 mean @entity44 can win title with a win if @entity6 finishes third or lower
2014 season finale takes place at @entity8 on sunday
