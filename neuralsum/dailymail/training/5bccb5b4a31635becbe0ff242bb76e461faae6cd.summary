few can fail to be awed by the spectacle of shimmering curtains of green that twist and turn on the horizon , combined with twirling cascades of red , yellow and purple			0
normally the event – known as the aurorae borealis in the northern hemisphere – is only seen by those in high latitudes such as @entity13 , or by people who are prepared to pay to go on a winter @entity16 cruise			1
above , the sky turns pink and yellow swirl of colour : photographer @entity45 captures the @entity23 lighting up the sky over the small town of @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity13 , during the night historic : the sky lights up red above @entity53 in @entity54 unbelieveable : the @entity23 display at @entity55 , near @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity13			1
the display lasted for two hours before clouds obscured them starry - eyed : the stars are caused by the collision of electronically charged particles with atoms in the high altitude atmosphere stunning : the @entity23 were also visible in the @entity66 of @entity67			1
above , the @entity23 light up the sky near @entity69 in @entity70 out of this world : and they also appeared over areas of @entity13 , such as @entity74 in @entity75 ( pictured ) but not this week			1
after months of storms , floods and downpours , nature took pity on us and gave a rare glimpse of the lights across most of the @entity83 , including southern @entity67			2
in @entity85 , @entity28 , @entity86 , @entity21 and even @entity87 , stargazers were able to enjoy one of the best displays in years			1
the sight is caused when electrically charged particles ejected from the @entity92 – known as a coronal mass ejection – hit gases in the @entity96 ’s upper atmosphere			1
the nature of the @entity96 ’s magnetic field means these particles usually rain down around the @entity100			1
but if the outburst from the @entity92 is strong enough – and an eruption this week was particularly powerful – there are so many charged particles bombarding the atmosphere they can be seen from much lower latitudes , including southern @entity37			1
dr @entity108 , of @entity109 at @entity110 , said astronomers got wind that we were in for a spectacular week after satellites captured activity on our nearest star			0
spectacular : people watch the @entity23 , dance over @entity120 in @entity121 just outside @entity122 lit up : the lighthouse appears to light up as a collision of particles from the sun enter the earth 's atmosphere watching in awe : a man watches the spectacular array of lights , which have caused the lighthouse to gleam a blinding shade of white hard to believe : the @entity23 fill the sky with an eerie green above @entity138 , @entity13 , last night gleaming : the @entity23 , or the @entity23 as they are commonly known , at @entity120 and @entity139 in @entity121 , @entity140 visible : such light displays in the sky often occur in the @entity16 and @entity145 regions , but they were visible in @entity140 amazing : a sightseer points at the @entity23 at @entity147 in @entity148 colourful : the bay was lit up with purple , blue and green colours as millions of particles entered the earth 's atmosphere she said : ‘ when we were watching the @entity92 on tuesday we saw that a particularly large and fast eruption leapt off from its atmosphere , and the models predicted that we would probably get a glancing blow from this eruption , and they were right			1
’ she added : ‘ they are always seen at high latitudes – they are there all the time			0
but when we get a large coronal mass ejection from the @entity92 , it erodes the @entity96 ’s magnetic field and we get the lights at lower latitudes			1
in 1859 , the lights were so strong they were seen almost down at the @entity172			0
’ the colours of lights produced depend on the gases hit by the solar particles			2
the most common in northern latitudes is a yellowish pale green – caused as a result of collisions with oxygen atoms 60 miles high			1
rarer red aurorae happen when particles striking oxygen 200 miles up			0
nitrogen gas produces blue or purple light			0
scientists know what causes the colours – but the reasons behind what causes patterns like shimmering curtains or steadily glowing sheets remain a mystery			0
this week ’s lights were a reminder of the beauty of space weather – but also its dangers			0
beautiful : the northern lights are pictured over a house , garden and greenhouse in @entity74 , @entity206 - shire mesmerising : a beautiful display of lights is pictured above the house in @entity74 - giving the property warm yellow glow spectators : dozens of people gathered to watch the breathtaking display of lights at @entity121 in @entity140 last night daylight : the night appears to turn into day as the lights shine over @entity120 in @entity121 @entity219 told the @entity220 : ' the electronically charged particles take two or three days to get here ' above , the @entity23 at @entity222 , @entity223 he added : ' when they do get here they cause the gas atoms in the sky to glow			1
it is as simple as that ' solar eruptions can knock out satellites , interfere with high frequency radio communications and damage electricity networks , said dr @entity234			0
photographer @entity235 , who spotted the lights from @entity237 on @entity238 in @entity21 , said : ' well tonight turned into something truly amazing			2
' what was meant to be a simple night time shoot of the stars turned into something which i can only describe as awesome			0
' this shot , taken at @entity237 in @entity238 shows the night time sky with a weird green glow			2
is it a @entity249 ? is it the @entity23 ? whatever it is , it was unbelievable ! ' meanwhile , stargazers in @entity28 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity70 and parts of @entity13 were also treated to stunning views of the @entity23			1
twitter user and meteorologist , @entity258 , posted a stunning photograph from his home in @entity27 , @entity28 at around 8pm last night			2
the @entity23 or as most people know them as the @entity23 , is giving spectacular displays , lighting up the skies over the @entity37 under clear skies breathtaking : a streak of red can be seen in the sky as dozens of rocks rest on @entity147 in @entity148 below view : the northern lights are pictured above @entity53 in @entity54 ( left ) and @entity48 in @entity49 ( right ) last night the aurora was due to last for several hours before fading during the early hours of this morning the skies were lit up red and green last night as a spectacular display of the @entity23 illuminated parts of the country @entity219 , presenter of @entity275 , told the @entity220 : ‘ what happens is there is stuff called the solar wind , which is electronically charged particles , and they take two or three days to get here and when they do get here they cause the gas atoms in the sky to glow			1
it is as simple as that			0
’ the lights could be seen in the northern regions of the country last night , such as @entity121 in @entity140 , where a lighthouse could be seen shining brightly			1
they were also captured by photographers above @entity13 - based homes in @entity296 in @entity75 , and @entity55 , near @entity56 in @entity57			2
mr @entity219 said the aurora over @entity37 had been expected , after a burst of activity on the sun around four days ago , but that it had been brighter than expected			2
‘ @entity304 displays usually happen around the @entity306 poles , so to see them this far south is pretty rare , ’ he told the @entity302			0
‘ i have n’t seen one like that in @entity28 for about 20 years			0
’ the aurora was due to last for several hours before fading during the early hours of this morning			0
‘ scientifically , we do n’t learn a lot from aurora borealis – they are just nice to look at , ’ he added			0
‘ but i ’m writing a book on astonomical photography at the moment and , as luck would have it , i got the chance to get some pictures of my own			0

such light displays in the sky often occur in the @entity16 and @entity145 regions , but illuminated parts of @entity37 last night
northern lights are caused by collision of particles from the sun with atoms in @entity96 's high - altitude atmosphere
