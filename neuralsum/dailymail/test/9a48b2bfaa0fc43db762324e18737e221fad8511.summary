’ though @entity6 claimed to work as a fundraiser for a charity the economic crime auditor for the @entity165 found no evidence that the geology graduate from @entity144 had any earnings other than some in 1993 , 1999 and 2000			0

both occurred after about 12 years of marriage and @entity6 , pictured here with his first wife , @entity12 , told wildly varying stories about both deaths			2

contrary to what he told law enforcement he made nine different trips to the area around @entity225 that summer			0
the fortnight before their anniversary – the date of her death – @entity6 had hiked six trails to ‘ find the perfect one for the trip			0
’ and damningly a map found in his car showed the spot where @entity7 fell to her death , marked with a pink @entity237 in both @entity12 and @entity7 ’s deaths @entity6 was eager to have his wives ’ bodies cremated quickly despite family requests against it and , disturbingly , he spread both women ’s ashes on the same mountain near @entity245 , @entity146			2
