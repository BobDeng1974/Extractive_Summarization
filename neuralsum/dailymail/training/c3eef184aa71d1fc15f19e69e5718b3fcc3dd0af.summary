but he recently declined to ask the state clemency board to recommend that the governor either delay his execution or commute his death sentence in prison			0
a clemency request would be futile because the board had n't shown mercy to other death - row inmates , he told the board in a handwritten letter			2
' i do n't want to put anyone through that , especially since i 'm convinced that ... it 's pointless , ' he wrote			0
' i reckon i know how to die , and if it 's my time , i 'll go without fanfare			0
