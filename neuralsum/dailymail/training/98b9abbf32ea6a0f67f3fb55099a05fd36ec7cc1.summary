@entity35 tweeted : ‘ at last , the revolution has reached @entity37 [ an @entity4 tv building ]			0
this decision is not a grant , but a legal right			0
’ the new rules for state tv were one of the first actions by the new information minister @entity46			0
it is estimated that 70 per cent of the female population in @entity4 wears a veil , however under president @entity29 female state television employees were banned from appearing on camera wearing a hijab			1
@entity53 headed : a female presenter on state - owned @entity55 appears without a veil some sued against the policy and won , but @entity29 ’s @entity59 would ignore the rulings			1
privately - owned networks have long employed veiled presenters and many famous actresses have taken the veil and continued to appear in soap operas aired on the state television network			2

with @entity34 's election and the appointment of @entity46 , who is a member of the @entity22 , she said she was given ‘ the green light ’ to come back to state tv			1
