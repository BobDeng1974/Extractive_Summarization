at @entity2 last saturday , @entity1 supporters arrived outside the turnstiles armed with buckets to rally the troops and collect funds for the @entity7			1
‘ @entity13 ’ , as he is affectionately known , is the former @entity10 and @entity11 defender who was working as a coach for @entity1 when struck down by locked - in syndrome in the autumn of 2010			2
the locals are relentless in their support , and they were upset and angered to be told by stewards that they could not fund - raise within the grounds			0
protest : @entity1 fans have made their feelings clear about @entity25 's running of the club chairman : supporters have staged protests in recent months against @entity25 , pictured above this is just one example of a club who appear to have lost their moral compass			1
this famous old club — whose most gifted forefathers include @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 — have plummeted from everyone ’s favourite @entity42 underdogs to an embarrassing basket case in three years			1
@entity44 has spent the week in @entity1 , talking to fans , players and former employees			1
it does not take long for a picture to emerge of a club bemused and angered in equal measure by the actions of chairman @entity25 and his family			1
our investigation uncovers the explosive truth behind the bedlam at @entity1 , where organisation , structure and common decency are foreign concepts to the chairman			2
many supporters believe his only motivation is avarice			0
when manager @entity69 leads out his side at @entity71 on saturday afternoon , an illusion of normality will descend over the @entity72			1
this football club , however , are anything but normal			2
tough job : @entity69 arrived to take over at @entity1 in july to find the club had just six professional players @entity69 , a summer appointment , arrived at the dilapidated training ground in july to discover that he had only six professionals			1
since then , a bargain - basement approach to the transfer market has seen 12 players arrive in 12 days — midfielder @entity84 the latest on a one - year deal			1
they now have 19 but many are strangers to one another			0
a goalkeeper , @entity88 , was signed on a loan deal from @entity90 on tuesday			1
lord only knows how @entity1 intend to defend set - pieces on saturday			1
not that @entity93 will be there to witness it — he intends to jet off to @entity96 for his summer holiday			1
@entity1 have banked £ 100million since falling from the @entity42 in 2011 in parachute payments and transfer fees			1
this summer their rotten core has been on public display , but the signs have been there for long enough			2
the working conditions that former manager @entity105 was subjected to before he was dismissed in january after less than a year in charge reeked of @entity108 football			0
on away trips , senior members of staff would be expected to go to local supermarkets and buy ready meals of lasagne and spaghetti bolognese			2
new signing : former @entity117 goalkeeper @entity88 is one of 12 players to arrive in the last two weeks addition : midfielder @entity84 has also joined @entity1 on a one - year deal for the coming season at the club ’s @entity123 training ground , players did their morning stretches with rain water splashing into buckets from the gymnasium ’s leaky roof			1
the facilities there — once described by former manager @entity132 as a ‘ hell hole ’ — are among the worst in the @entity135 game			2
‘ @entity137 and a turn - off , ’ was one scathing verdict this week			0
last season , many players refused to shower , dodging the temperatures that veer between freezing and boiling , to head home after training			2
the club refused to respond to criticism of the facilities , as they did when approached by @entity44 repeatedly by telephone and email over the past week			2
no wonder stalwarts have jumped ship			0
@entity153 , the long - serving secretary , is understood to have left for a better financial package at @entity155			0
disagreements : @entity105 was dismissed in january after a tempestuous time in charge of @entity1 critical : former boss @entity132 said @entity1 's facilities are ' a hell hole ' and the worst in the @entity135 game the last of the players from the @entity42 team who were relegated in 2011 , @entity162 , departed for @entity11 after being offered a contract extension — with a 60 per cent wage cut — by text message			1
the offer to @entity162 , a long - standing servant , is symptomatic of the cost - cutting policies @entity93 continues to employ			0
players are paid £ 90 a week in the summer as they are not deemed to be ‘ working ’			1
‘ everybody at this club is captive , ’ explained one dressing - room source			2
‘ the players are unwanted trialists in need of a club or young players who need experience			2
the coaches or managers appointed tend to be out of favour and in need of one more chance			0
nobody actually wants to be there , it ’s a short - term stepping stone			0
’ @entity69 , appointed in june , already faces an uncertain future			2
the @entity190 whispers suggest @entity191 , the assistant manager , is being lined up as his replacement , while the name @entity194 continues to crop up in discussions			0
loyalty : club 's longest serving player @entity162 , pictured right during @entity1 's 2013 game against @entity199 , has joined @entity11 after being told to take a pay cut			1
he played against the @entity201 in a friendly last week , left @entity202 , the @entity203 who owns 20 % of the club , is disappointed the @entity206 have not reinvested in the club ... ' in the name of @entity1 i am very disappointed to hear that @entity25 refuses to escrow the last parachute payment to ensure a competitive team for the coming season			1
as i see it this will lead to a continuation of our current downward spiral - a negative result in a situation where it could be totally opposite			0
' ' we believe that last year ’s result was the outcome of unsound policies pursued since 2011			2
in order to succeed one must have a clear strategy and an operating plan , which current management does n’t have			0
without a clear plan any venture is deemed to fail			0
' ' we have a good collaboration with newly formed @entity230 and helped them to arrange @entity230 launch party where all ticket revenue will go to @entity7			0
we believe that football should be about people and local community			0
' for the @entity1 supporters , the true victims among the wreckage , resentment intensifies over @entity242 ’s refusal to invest			1
this distressing script is now mimicking the best funfair rides in town , but the steady climb that captured the hearts of most fans has been followed by a relentless and frightening descent			0
supporters we spoke to despise @entity25 for his failure to cement a legacy from the year they enjoyed in the @entity42			1
since earning promotion to the top flight in 2010 , around £ 100m has entered @entity1 ’s accounts			1
official figures from the @entity42 reveal that @entity1 have received £ 76.53m , including parachute payments and solidarity fees			1

the club ’s former shorts sponsors , @entity292 ’s builders , who did many jobs for the club , claim they were left bankrupt by @entity25 after a dispute over payments			1
owner @entity292 , who was an usher at @entity93 ’s wedding and went on family holidays with @entity25 , said : ‘ we had to be put into receivership after 25 - 30 years in business			1
we have emigrated to @entity303 due to the personal embarrassment			0
’ again , the @entity93 family declined to comment			0
the family this summer bought the @entity307 estate in @entity308 , valued by one property website at £ 3.25m			1
determined : @entity310 , a lifelong @entity1 fan , holds a poster protesting against the @entity206 on august 2 @entity25 ’s son , @entity312 , regularly mocks supporters on social media , posting pictures of his plush cars on @entity317			1
@entity312 now has a minder to protect him			0
@entity312 runs the @entity1 hotel , a separate business on the corner of the stadium , which fans believe is often prioritised before the club			1
many of them are refusing to buy season tickets			0
at the working men ’s club over the road , fans are mulling over their next move			2
@entity333 , chairman of the @entity334 , said : ‘ we want @entity25 to put football first			2
look at the hotel compared to the stadium			0
it is pristine with fancy furnishing			0
' in the stadium , you can see panels coming away from the ceiling and rust on the stands			0
outside , there are weeds on the statue of the great @entity38			0
‘ the relationship between the @entity206 and fans is at its lowest ebb			0
if he ’s not prepared to invest , give someone else a chance			0
