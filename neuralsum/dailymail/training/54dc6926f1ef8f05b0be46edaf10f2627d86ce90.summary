although they ( @entity6 media ) did n't report it , a lot of people knew about it			2
' under the @entity6 education system , @entity192 became a constant factor in her understanding of the world as a child , something that made meeting her first @entity72 a big shock on a rare trip to see relatives in @entity182			2
she said : ' at that time no one there spoke @entity206 and i was lost			0
