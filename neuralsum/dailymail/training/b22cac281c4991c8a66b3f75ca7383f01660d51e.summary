and with more than 180,000 bulbs , a searchlight that can be seen for almost four miles and an estimated £ 1,000 electricity bill for the month , he certainly did n’t disappoint			1
indeed , his neighbours say you can see this extraordinary collection from space			2

wonder : this amazing christmas lights display in @entity22 , @entity23 , attracts coachloads of visitors teamwork : mr @entity2 's friend @entity27 helped him finish the amazing display fairy story : with hundreds of lights and figurines it is hard to believe the house is n't part of a film set he took a break from delighting the locals in 2010 and 2011			1
but this year the electrician promised his show would be better than ever – adding a snow machine , the searchlight and thousands more lights			2
he said : ‘ i ’ve been collecting lights and decorations for years , so it ’s just sort of grown			0
there are some new pieces i ’m particularly excited about			0
’ mr @entity2 has had to pay @entity49 £ 700 to lay an industrial strength cable to his home to cope with the drain caused by the display			1
the lights go on every day from 5.30pm and mr @entity2 has them switched off at 10pm ‘ out of respect to his neighbours ’			0

his neighbour @entity81 , 69 , said : ‘ we do ours for the air ambulance as it is nice to give something back to the community			0
‘ i think you could see @entity2 ’s display from space , there is not a part of that house which is n’t covered in lights			1
’ after raising £ 4,000 for the @entity94 in nearby @entity95 in 2009 , mr @entity2 took a two year break but he decided to start again and hopes to raise even more for the charity this year			1
despite the coachloads of visitors who flock to the suburban street to catch a glimpse of his display , mr @entity2 says most neighbours are supportive of his decision to switch on the lights once again			2
vast : nearly 100,000 lights are used in in the display he said : ' some of the neighbours might have been glad when we stopped , but i wanted to do it again , for @entity94			2
