if you want to use your phone in @entity2 stay out of @entity3 , while people who want to talk on the phone on the train are best off with three			1
that ’s according to new research that looked at popular commuting routes in the capital			0
and they found one in three internet tasks were dropped and one in seven calls failed during testing			1
scroll down for interactive map engineers have tested voice and data connections in @entity2 ( shown in map )			1
they travelled back and forth on the ten most popular lines			1
all were found to be plagued by poor voice and data connections			1
one in three internet tasks were dropped during testing the research was carried out by @entity27 ( @entity27 )			1
they carried out high - level tests while travelling back and forth on the ten most popular commuting routes in and our of @entity2			2
and they found that the lines were plagued by reliability issues for both voice calls and data transfers			1
when attempting to send data ‘ packets ’ while on the routes , one in four 3g packets and one in three 4g packets did n’t send properly			0
@entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 were all found to rely heavily on their older 2g networks			0
@entity44 customers got the best 3g data service , while @entity42 offered the best 4g service			0
but @entity27 ’ testing suggests that it ’s not just the mobile internet that @entity52 struggle to use while commuting : one in seven voice calls ( 14 per cent ) made from trains fail too			1
three was a clear winner for call quality and reliability here			0
the poor service from the other operators was blamed on their continued use of @entity63 and half - rate codecs			2
one in seven calls were also found to fail due to networks still using @entity63 , although @entity67 was found to be the best			1
meanwhile the worst station to get a connection was found to be @entity3 meanwhile , one in four of the data task failures ( 24.18 per cent to be exact ) @entity27 ’ engineers experienced occurred while they were on trains in stations , while one in five occurred when they were on trains on open stretches of track			1
however , voice calls are more likely to fail on open track than in a station ; one in four of the voice ‘ failures ’ @entity27 ’ engineers experienced occurred when they were in a station , compared to 1 in 3 when they were on open track			2
@entity27 found that voice and data failures are more likely to occur when a train is travelling from zero to five miles ( eight kilometres ) per hour than when it is travelling between speeds of five and 50 ( eight and 80 kilometres ) per hour			0
failures are most likely to occur when a train is travelling above 50mph ( 80km/h )			0
for stations , @entity3 has by far and away the worst connectivity of all of those tested by @entity27			2
the engineers experienced an average of 99 voice and packet data failures ( across the four operators ) while testing in the famous station			2
@entity101 , ceo of @entity27 , commented : ' leaves on the track , the wrong kind of snow , having to stand up all the way to work and back - commuters have enough to contend with without the kind of mobile connectivity problems we ’re revealing today			0
' it ’s hard to believe we ’re in 2014 and in a situation whereby a trained wizard would have a tough time getting a signal on the @entity117 while it ’s sitting in @entity3			0
' pressure from commuters makes it inevitable that trains wo n’t keep their status as mobile dead zones for much longer			0
' it ’d be great to see networks , rail operators and station - masters taking the lead on improving connectivity for commuters - rather than having to be dragged into the @entity131 kicking and screaming			0

however a *spokesman* for the station tells @entity153 it was ' only an issue for people using @entity157 trains from two *platforms* that are essentially below the surface '
