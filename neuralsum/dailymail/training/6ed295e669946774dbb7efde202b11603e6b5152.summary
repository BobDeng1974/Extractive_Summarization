by @entity0 @entity1 may tout itself as being a publicly responsible , green fingered , all - things - good company that touts green technology , but the companies chief executives are not setting a good example from on @entity9 fact , it would appear they 're flying high whilst @entity11 taxpayers foot the bill			1
despite lobbying the federal government on environmental policy , @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 have put 3.4 million miles on their private jets in recent years , polluting the atmosphere with 100 million pounds of carbon dioxide according to @entity22			2
forget using @entity24 to conduct business , the execs prefer the old - fashioned method of face - to - face communication			0
often , they 'll take a trip on one of the enormous corporate fuel - guzzling 757 or 767 aircraft or the more exclusive @entity32 at a moments notice – and sometimes to the most exotic of vacation destinations			0
hypocritical : the company extol the virtues of greener living but it also appears that @entity1 are happy to travel at the expense of taxpayers in gas - guzzling jets racking up the airlmiles : @entity1 ; e owns several aircraft including this @entity32 private jet we only pay this much : executive chairman of @entity1 @entity15 is one of the lucky @entity1 employees who has a fleet of aircraft at his disposal			1
better yet , the fuel is also far cheaper than anyone else pays thanks to taxpayers their trips have been analyzed and logged and show that despite trying to convince federal lawmakers to introduce stringent and restrictive environmental regulations , they happily jet off using gallons of polluting aviation fuel			0
it might not be such a big deal if @entity1 would practice what it preaches			1
the search engine powerhouse has been a leading proponent of encouraging the federal government to , as the company says , ‘ put a price on carbon through cap - and - trade or a carbon tax			2
’ through has introduced its own @entity76 as well as a clean energy 2030 proposal to wean the @entity11 off its reliance on fossil fuels			0
@entity1 wishes to transform the economy from one running on fossil fuels to one largely based on clean energy			0
they ’re happy to talk about building whole new industries and creating millions of new jobs along with cutting energy costs both at the gas pump and at home			0
could it be that this is nothing more than hot - air in an effort to maintain its hip image ? gas - guzzler : @entity1 even owns 767 and 757 jets such as this one			1
their trips , according to flight log data analyzed , included single - day jaunts and brief corporate meetings , but also what appear to be hundreds of exotic vacation destinations the @entity22 claim that when a company attempts to manipulate the government into using environmental policies to determine what types of cars @entity11 can drive , what kinds of jobs @entity11 can have and how taxpayers ’ hard - earned dollars are spent , it should at least be unerring in its commitment to the environment			1
@entity116 , a fellow at the @entity117 has been looking through the hours and hours of flying time generated by @entity1 ’s @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15			0
@entity1 maintains a hangar of jets ready to take to the air at a moments ’ notice			1
in total , according to flight data that was analyzed , @entity1 executives have flown more than 3.4 million miles , burning an average of 100,000 gallons of fuel every month in recent years			2
@entity1 ’s planes burned through nearly 59 million barrels of crude since 2007 , much of it on non-essential trips to adult playgrounds @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			1
the supposedly environmentally conscious company ’s jets have emitted more than 100 million pounds of carbon dioxide over the last four years alone			0
@entity1 co-founder @entity13 : @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 have put 3.4 million miles on their private jets in recent years , polluting the atmosphere with 100 million pounds of carbon dioxide no wonder he 's smiling : @entity14 , @entity1 co-founder and ceo uses campaign contributions to strong - arm federal lawmakers into hamstringing everyone else with restrictive environmental regulations it even appears that @entity1 is hand - in - glove with the government			1
@entity1 has snagged a few favors along the way and has been getting preferential rent when it comes to housing their collection of gigantic jets			2
since 2007 , the private airplane fleet owned by @entity1 execs has been housed in a hangar at @entity167 ’s @entity166 just outside @entity1 ’s @entity168 , @entity169			1
the hangars are funded by the taxpayer and are supposed to be for aircraft conducting scientific research for @entity167			0
the government is even allowing @entity1 to fill itself up with jet fuel at a cut price deal – again , thanks to @entity11 taxpayers			2
the fuel was of course meant for @entity167 and @entity182 aircraft , but why fly somewhere else to fill up when you have it on tap ? mr @entity116 estimates that @entity1 officials spent $ 29 million on jet fuel – a saving of around $ 10 million			2
but what is $ 10 million to a company that has generated $ 60 billion in revenue over the past few years ? it should come as no surprise that as a result of @entity1 ’s involvement with the government and securing their cheap and exclusive parking space and fuel s for the company ’s jets , @entity1 also happens to be among the largest contributors to political campaigns in the @entity11			1
almost a million dollars was given to president @entity203 ’s campaign in 2008 with a similar amount in 2012			0
not practicing what they preach : while @entity1 encourages government to limit carbon emissions for the rest of the @entity11 economy , company @entity207 are zooming through the skies , polluting their way to the exotic playgrounds of the rich and famous mr @entity116 claims that ‘ by pushing strict ‘ climate change ’ policy on everyone else , while polluting up a storm themselves			1
‘ @entity1 reaches levels of hypocrisy not seen since i uncovered the inconvenient truth about frenzied environmentalist @entity216 , who devours about 20 times more electricity in his mansion than the average @entity11 family uses in their home over the course of a year			0
’ incidentally , mr @entity216 has been an company has had plenty of time to learn directly from the discredited environmental prophet , whom they have paid handsomely to serve as a ‘ senior adviser ‘ since 2001			0
’ as @entity1 continues to extol the virtues of environmental purity and encourage the government to limit carbon emissions for the rest of the @entity11 economy , its own company @entity207 are busy zooming around , polluting the skies as they go on travel subsidized by @entity11 taxpayers			1
perhaps @entity1 should begin by @entity245 word ‘ @entity246 ’ ?			0

@entity1 execs have traveled millions of miles to playgrounds of the rich and famous
several trips on company jets were to @entity253
planes are filled up with government - subsidized fuel and even get to park cheaply
company maintains a green image yet does not practice what it preaches
