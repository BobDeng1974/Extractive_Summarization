the percentage of @entity2 women currently in the workforce or actively seeking work has dropped to 56.7per cent - the lowest it has been since 1988			1
according to new data released by the @entity7 , the labor participation rate of women age 16 and over in september was .2per cent lower than the rate in august			1
one factor responsible for the change may be that young women these days are staying in college or graduate school longer than they used to			2
out of work : the percentage of @entity2 women currently in the workforce or actively seeking work has dropped to 56.7per cent - the lowest it has been since 1988 the rate first began climbing in the 1950s , when women entered the workforce for the first time			1
it was at its peak in 2000 at 63per cent , and has been steadily declining ever since			0
meanwhile , the rate of male labor participation was 69.1per cent in september , down from 69.2per cent in august			1
' women have begun to depart the labor force in a way that 's similar to men , ' @entity28 , @entity29 bureau chief for @entity30 , told @entity35			2
according to @entity37 , an economist for the @entity7 , further education is one of the main reasons for this drop			0
she says that with the struggling economy , many young people are staying in school until they see an improvement			0
pattern : the rate first began climbing in the 1950s , when women entered the workforce for the first time			0
it was at its peak in 2000 at 63per cent , and has been steadily declining ever since and those who are going into the workforce right after college run the risk of getting laid off during cutbacks			0
' during a recession , the young people are the last to be hired and the first to be fired and facing competition from more senior employees , ' she explained			0
what 's more , women dominate the fields that got hit hardest by the financial crisis ; they make up nearly 60per cent of local and state government employees and 70per cent of educators			1
not only are fewer women entering the workforce , but the data also showed an increase in stay - at - home moms - from 23per cent in 1999 to 29per cent i 2012			1
this is likely linked to the fact that childcare is the biggest household expense for many families , with the average annual cost of full - time infant care ranging from $ 4,863 in @entity83 to $ 16,430 in @entity84 .			2

according to the @entity7 , the labor participation rate of women 16 and over in september is at 56.7per cent
this may be because women are staying in college longer , they dominate the fields that were hit hardest by recession , and they are *choosing* to be stay - at - home momes since childcare is a huge household expense
