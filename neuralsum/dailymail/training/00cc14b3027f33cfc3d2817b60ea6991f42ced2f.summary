living in a wealthy country does n’t necessarily mean you will be happier , according to a study			0
researchers found that once a nation ’s gross domestic product surpasses £ 22,200 per person , individual happiness begins to nosedive – as the worry of ‘ keeping up with the @entity10 ’ kicks in			1
the researchers said these high expectations in the world ’s wealthiest countries were to blame for creating dissatisfaction among citizens			2
the @entity18 study compared per capita gdp with data on life satisfaction gathered from the @entity22			1
wealth does n't pay : once a country 's gdp per person tops £ 22,200 per person , the level of the nation 's individual happiness starts to drop in the poorest countries happiness rises as a country ’s wealth increases and citizens are able to afford their basic needs			1
people in countries with a gdp per capita of below £ 4,100 were 12 per cent less likely to report the highest level of life satisfaction than those in countries where it reached £ 11,100			1
however , beyond a level of £ 12,600 per person , the link between increasing prosperity and happiness is much less marked			0
between this level and the very highest gdp per capita level £ 33,000 , the probability of reporting the top level of life satisfaction changes by no more than two per cent			1
satisfaction peaked at £ 22,200 , after which it appeared to dip in the world ’s richest nations			1
it means @entity18 , with a per capita gdp of around £ 22,800 , should be fairly satisfied with their lives			1
lead researcher dr @entity59 , of @entity60 , said : ‘ whether wealth can buy a country ’s happiness is a major question for governments			0
many policy - makers , including in the @entity18 , are interested in official measures of national well - being			0
satisfaction : graphic shows how happiness declines in countries with a gross domestic product of £ 22,100 per capita ' our new analysis has one very surprising finding which has not been reported before – that life satisfaction appears to dip beyond a certain level of wealth			1
‘ in our study we see evidence that this is down to changes in the aspiration levels of people living in the richest countries			0
‘ as countries get richer , higher levels of gdp lead to higher aspiration			0
there is a sense of keeping up with the @entity10 as people see wealth and opportunity all around them and aspire to having more			0
‘ but this aspiration gap – the difference between actual income and the income we would like – eats away at life - satisfaction levels			0
‘ in other words , what we aspire to becomes a moving target and one which moves away faster in the richest countries , causing the dip in happiness we see in our analysis			0
’ contrast : based on the findings , residents of wealthier nations such as @entity112 , pictured , should be less content than their @entity18 counterparts			0
but a separate @entity117 study ranked the country in the top five of most satisfied nations , while @entity18 was ranked in 22nd place the findings , published in journal @entity124 , seem to confirm the @entity125 – that the link between life satisfaction and gdp is more or less flat in richer countries			1
but the study seemed to go further in suggesting a small drop in life satisfaction once countries go beyond a certain level of prosperity			2
based on the findings , residents of wealthier nations such as the @entity136 , @entity112 and @entity137 should be less content than their @entity18 counterparts because of the higher gdp per person			2
but a separate @entity117 study published earlier this year found all three countries rank in the top five most satisfied nations , while @entity18 was ranked in 22nd place .			2

a @entity18 study compared per capita gdp with data on life satisfaction
it found satisfaction peaked in countries with a gdp at £ 22,200 per person
after £ 22,200 , happiness levels dip in the world 's richest nations
researchers say higher life aspirations in these countries is to blame
