and another story below it about an actress sacked from @entity22 is headlined ' @entity25 's yer lot ' , which could be seen as a coded confirmation of the end of topless women on the page			1
the images of the models have long drawn protests from feminists and a petition calling for the abolition of the controversial feature has attracted more than 200,000 signatures			1
now , it appears the call to end topless women on @entity9 may have been heard			2
yesterday , @entity6 showed model @entity40 wearing a bra - but it is not clear whether the cover - up is permanent			2
the @entity45 reported that the newspaper 's management had made a ' landmark decision ' to drop the pictures topless women , dubbed @entity9 girls			1
in addition , the @entity51 reported that it understands last friday 's print edition ' was the last that will carry an image of a glamour model with bare breasts on that page '			1
the @entity6 's @entity60 edition stopped using topless models in 2013			1
last year , @entity6 owner @entity1 asked his @entity63 followers for their opinion on the issue last year			2
i bet never buy paper			0

this could be truly historic news and a great day for people power			0
' we do n't know the details for sure and there 's still lots to be done , but this could be a huge step for challenging media sexism			2
' and we are so incredibly grateful to all of you who stood up and said ' @entity100 '			0
' the newspaper 's editor has defended the controversial feature in the past , saying women readers fully support it			2
in 2013 , @entity106 told @entity107 5 live he was ' standing ( his ) ground ' despite pressure from politicians , anti-sexism campaigners and student bodies			0
former glamour models @entity114 ( left ) and @entity115 ( right ) also had their careers launched by @entity9 backlash : former glamour model @entity118 wrote a series of angry messages on @entity63 page 3 girl @entity121 , 28 , also lashed out at the reported move when she took to @entity63 today he said : ' i think that it is a lively issue for people who do n't buy the paper and we 've done the research , done the focus groups and in many ways listened to the campaigners to say : ' what does it mean to our readers ? ' the result comes back a resounding " keep it there , do n't take it away "			1

' i am delighted that the old fashioned sexism of @entity9 could soon be a thing of the past			0
' i welcome this apparent step forward from the @entity6 , but i would encourage its editors to consider whether parading women in bikinis is really a modern reflection of the contribution women make to society			0
' we need to ensure that media representation of women reflects the great achievements that women make to business , to families and to society			0
i 'd like to see us providing positive role models for young girls instead of suggesting that women 's contribution is in how they look			1

it was disrespectful and embarrassing			0

in a series of tweets she said : ' so - called " feminists " really annoy me			2
telling girls they should n't do page 3 is not being a feminist ; women should do whatever they want			1
' commenting on her career as a @entity9 pin - up , she said : ' i loved doing page 3 , it was good money , i felt powerful , i was definitely in control and all the people ( mostly women ) i worked with were fab			1
' i never felt exploited - in fact the opposite			0
i thought " blimey , people are willing to pay to see my boobs "			0
' i am very much a feminist			0
i believe women can do it all and have it all			0
women who slag off other women are just jealous and insecure			0

she told @entity297 's @entity296 : ' it has been going for many years , which is one of the reasons i feel so sad that it has seemingly come to an end			2
' i do n't think it is outdated			0
i think the girls still look fantastic on the page , they still clearly enjoy what they are doing , people still want to see it			2
' everybody still wants @entity9 , apart from the feminists who are fighting an argument i just do n't agree with			0

' we certainly do n't feel like we have been victimised			0
' the protesters said they wanted the feature to be ' removed voluntarily ' rather than banned			0

@entity328 ! ' no more page 3 founder @entity140 said last night that the group would not claim victory if scantily clad women continued to appear in the paper but it was a ' step in the right direction ' if they were no longer topless			1
she told @entity337 's @entity336 : ' i 'm not going to stand here and say ' there 's going to now be women in underwear on page three and is n't that great '			1
' @entity6 could have gone ' ok we are going to celebrate women 's sport on page three because we never cover that and there are women doing great sport and we would like to use the space for that '			1
' @entity6 has n't suddenly decided that women say , think and do interesting and incredible things , it 's still basically saying women are here for decoration , but it 's a step in the right direction			2
