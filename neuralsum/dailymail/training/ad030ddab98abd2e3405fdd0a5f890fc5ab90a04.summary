by @entity0 advances : sales executive @entity2 endured unwelcome advances from her boss @entity4 , including having her leg groped two female sales executives were groped and leered at by their married boss , who was ‘ fixated ’ with one of the women ’s breasts , a tribunal has ruled			1
@entity4 , 55 , was obsessed with @entity14 ’s breasts and regularly spoke to them instead of her face , an employment tribunal found			0
he also fondled her thigh and groped the leg of her colleague , @entity2 , 29 , whom he falsely accused of being a part - time prostitute			0
mr @entity4 made smutty comments to the women , both university graduates , about his sexual prowess and desirability			1
he also made unwelcome advances towards @entity26 , offering to buy her gifts from @entity28 and @entity29 , and tried to persuade both women to dump their partners and go out with him instead			0
last night the women – who are each in line for up to £ 25,000 compensation after the tribunal ruled they had been victims of sexual harassment – told the @entity38 they felt ‘ vindicated ’ by the judgment			1
however , tribunal judge dr @entity40 said claims that he had asked the women for a threesome and bragged about bedding prostitutes and strippers and snorting cocaine were untrue			1
the panel also rejected the women ’s allegations that mr @entity4 had shown them images of scantily clad women on escort websites on his computer			1
the judge said the women , who earned £ 18,000 - a - year plus potentially high commissions , exaggerated the allegations because they feared they were about to lose their jobs			1
the tribunal , sitting in central @entity60 , was told that the women made a formal complaint against mr @entity4 two days after he warned them about their poor sales performance			2
@entity4 told @entity2 , right , that their colleague @entity14 , left , would not drown as ' she would just float because of her boobs ' yesterday miss @entity14 , 24 , who has a new job but has been treated for depression , said : ‘ we were regularly embarrassed and humiliated at work by @entity4 , it was disgusting the way he treated us			0
' he would stare at my breasts , making remarks about them			0
’ the tribunal ruled that both women wrongly claimed that mr @entity4 had invited both women to his £ 1.4 million penthouse for a threesome miss @entity2 , who is working as a sales executive for her father ’s security business in her native @entity84 , added : ‘ it was his word against ours , but now people know he did sexually harass us			1
’ the women began working at @entity90 , a @entity91 - based publishing firm , in may last year			1
miss @entity2 told the tribunal that on her first day mr @entity4 said she had a ‘ great body ’ , adding : ‘ have you ever considered working in a strip club ? ’ she claimed that the following day mr @entity4 asked the pair of them to have sex with him at his £ 1.4million penthouse in north @entity60 in return for a promotion			2
although he had made some comment about miss @entity2 ’s appearance being ‘ good ’ , mr @entity4 did not refer to a ‘ strip club , ’ the tribunal found			0
the panel also said that while he did ask the women to go and see his flat , he did not ask them for a threesome			2
recovering alcoholic mr @entity4 told the tribunal a threesome would be his ‘ worst nightmare ’ because , even with @entity110 , he was unable to have sex			2
however , the panel upheld @entity115 ’s claims that , almost immediately after she started working for the firm , mr @entity4 spoke to her breasts rather than her face and made crude comments about them			2
the panel partly upheld the women ’s claims of sexual harassment and victimisation , but rejected their sex and race discrimination claims			1
@entity128 , who represented the women , said he would be seeking ‘ substantial damages ’			0
‘ it was a terrible ordeal for both women , ’ he said			0
‘ there is some disappointment that certain of their allegations were not proven but that is more than balanced by the fact that sexually humiliating verbal comments and actual sexual assaults were found proven			0
’ a spokesman for @entity90 said that mr @entity4 was an independent contractor and no longer worked for the firm			0
the tribunal heard that @entity144 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) had joined @entity90 in @entity91 in may 2013 but were soon facing dismissal for poor performance			1

women complained of sexual harassment at @entity91 publishing company
they say they feel ' vindicated ' after tribunal upheld their claims
but tribunal rules allegations he asked them for a threesome were untrue
