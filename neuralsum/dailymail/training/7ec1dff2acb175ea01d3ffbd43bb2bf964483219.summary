by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 somewhere buried on the camera roll of his @entity3 is a photograph @entity6 took of the scoreboard as @entity8 lost 2 - 0 at @entity9 in the @entity10 last season			1
caught in the act at the @entity13 , the @entity8 chief executive , arm outstretched , looked a little like a fan , a tourist			1
@entity6 , though , took that photograph for a reason			2
that was the night he and fellow members of the @entity8 board realised that manager @entity22 was not the man for them anymore , a night when @entity6 saw players simply going through the motions , lying down in surrender to perhaps the worst team left in the competition			1
fresh ideas : @entity30 has an ' aura ' about him and is the right man for @entity8 , says @entity6 learning on the job : @entity8 chief executive @entity6 ( left ) says he is getting to grips with his role @entity36 will continue to spend - @entity37 in the spotlight : @entity39 is interviewed by @entity40 as he prepares for his first game in charge of the club new man : @entity39 ( right ) will bring fresh ideas and here he is talking with @entity46 ( left ) and @entity47 new era : @entity39 is determined to be successful at @entity8 as such , he took the photograph as a personal reminder of how bad things were , as something to look back on when things got better			1
ahead of @entity30 ’s first game as @entity8 manager at the @entity57 @entity56 tonight , @entity37 is now convinced things are about to get significantly better			1
' as i look back , i just feel a lot more positivity in terms of this coming season , ' said @entity6 last night			1
' part of that is simply because of what @entity65 did at the @entity67			2
' it 's given us a bit of an aura again			2
' he 's impressed everyone around the club since he started			2
' there 's a real positive energy and buzz around the place			0
' if last season was bad for @entity22 and @entity8 – who finished seventh in the @entity81 – then it was n’t great for @entity37 either			1
new era : @entity47 ( centre ) will help @entity30 get @entity8 back to the top preparations : @entity86 are pictured in full flow during pre-season training @entity90 replacement : @entity91 will fill the big boots left by the experienced @entity93 captain ? @entity47 confirmed @entity95 ( pictured ) would play against @entity96 on wednesday uncertain : but @entity47 was adamant that no decision had yet been made on who would captain @entity8 perceived by many as a novice chief executive unable to get things done in the transfer market last summer , @entity6 was lampooned on social media and criticised heavily in the mainstream			1
if @entity22 functioned last season in the shadow of predecessor sir @entity108 then perhaps @entity6 suffered by comparison to his own , @entity110 , and the 42 - year - old admits that his own search for credibility goes on			1
' it was a challenging year , ' he said , with some understatement			1
' in an ideal situation , i would have worked with @entity108 for a year			0
i would love to have done it personally			0
' most of the job was n't a surprise			0
i 've been at the club nine years			0
but i ca n’t say i walked in last season and knew everything because i did n’t			0
' you gain credibility through experience , through time			0
you ca n't expect it from day one and i would n't ask that of the fans			0
' look , criticism comes with the job and when you have got long term plans , you ca n't be distracted by short - term problems			0
' you do keep learning on the job and that will continue but i do n't mind reading about these kind of comments because i think it 's extremely important for me to listen to the fans			2
' good mates : @entity46 poses with @entity47 while visiting his former teammate legends : @entity47 ( left ) says no decision has yet been made on who will be @entity39 's captain spectators : @entity46 ( left ) and @entity90 ( right ) were both in attendance in @entity150 speaking at @entity8 ’s team hotel in @entity152 this week , @entity6 delayed a flight back to @entity154 in order to honour media promises			1
to him , perception is important , not due to personal vanity but because he recognised early on that – results apart – @entity8 ’s public image has not always been great			2
early indications are that @entity39 – whose team face @entity96 today – has done his own bit to lift spirits inside @entity166			1
there may have been some criticism of @entity8 ’s training ground – work began on rectifying that yesterday morning – and a nod towards top heavy commercial obligations , but club staff are already talking about a coach clearly energised – rather than awed – by the challenge			1
' we are a different sized club to anyone else , ' said @entity6			1
' almost at anywhere else you have been you have not experienced what being a @entity8 manager is until you have been @entity8 manager			2
new boy : summer signing @entity184 met @entity8 legend @entity46 big smile : @entity8 right - back @entity187 also posed for a snap with @entity46 ' but @entity65 is clearly excited by it			1
' i think he was one of the managers at the @entity67 who was proactive , he did more things in games , and that gave him a bigger profile			2
' that all helps and works for us			0
' @entity6 ’s message about transfer spending is already out there			2
if @entity30 wants money he can have pretty much as much as he likes			0
@entity37 would n’t be drawn in to talk of smashing transfer records – he has learned to spot imminent headlines – but was happy to point out that last week ’s new kit deal – cut with @entity207 to the tune of £ 750m – indicates the club ’s ongoing muscle and status			1
' as @entity65 said very eloquently , seventh last year is n’t the biggest but what the deal shows and what we ’re seeing with everything we ’re doing from a commercial perspective , talking to agents , talking from a player ’s perspective about wanting to come to us , we are the biggest club in the world , there ’s no question in my mind about that , ' he said			0
' the reality is that we 're not afraid of spending significant amounts of money in the transfer market			0
' whether it 's a record or not does n't really resonate with us			0
' there is no budget			0
we are in a very strong financial position			0
we can make big signings			0

@entity6 took a photo of scoreboard during @entity8 's 2 - 0 loss to @entity9 in @entity10 last season to serve as a reminder
he is convinced @entity39 is right man to take over from @entity22
@entity39 's ' aura ' that he *displayed* at the @entity67 ' excites ' @entity37
@entity6 admits it was a ' challenging year ' last season but he is learning
@entity8 's first pre-season game against @entity96 kicks off on wednesday
@entity47 confirms @entity95 will start match
@entity47 insists @entity39 is yet to decide on who is captain will be
@entity257 tells fan after @entity259 *friendly* that he will be leaving club
