@entity0 wowed @entity1 with a sardonic , humourous routine on the convention stage in which he interrogated an imaginary @entity4 and then declared : ' politicians are employees of ours ... when somebody does not do the job we ’ve got ta let them go			1
' at 82 , the @entity13 movie star , director and former mayor of @entity16 , @entity11 showed he still had an actor ’s sense of timing and a wry wit			1
recalling the 2008 election , he said : ‘ i just thought this was great			0
' but three and a half years later , he said , there were 23 million unemployed			0
' that is something to cry for			0
' he then mocked him for promising to close @entity45 and then changing his mind and for having ' the stupid idea of trying terrorists in downtown @entity49			0
' there were guffaws as he told the phantom president : ‘ i ’m not going to shut up - it 's my turn … i ca n’t tell him [ @entity35 ] to do that			0
he ca n’t do that to himself			0
' minutes later , a quick viewer created a @entity59 account called ' @entity60 ' with the biography field filled simply with the description ' stage left of @entity0 '			1
' @entity64 ' : @entity0 addresses an empty chair and questions it as if it the president , as he speaks on @entity35 's behalf at the @entity71 showing his allegiance : @entity0 has publicly talked about his @entity73 in the past , and first dabbled in politics as the mayor of @entity16 , @entity11 within ten minutes , the account had over 4,700 followers			1
beyond the jokes , @entity0 did include a slightly more serious message , criticizing the high unemployment rate under @entity4 , and the war in @entity82			1
he assured the crowd that while it may seem like @entity13 is filled solely with @entity86 , that is not the case			0
instead , he said that it was just the modesty of republicans that keep them out of the spotlight			0
' conservative people by the nature of the word itself , play a little closer to the vest they just do n't go around hot dogging it , ' @entity0 said			1
make my day : a photo of @entity0 from @entity99 is displayed behind him as he speaks comedic chops : for much of the short speech , he had a fake conversation with the empty chair next to him , pretending that mr @entity4 was sitting next to him he went on to give @entity104 a shout out , as the @entity107 winning actor has been working the convention floor for days			1
@entity0 spoke quietly and his address , made without notes or a teleprompter , brought down the energy level of the evening after a series of upbeat videos and testimonials from those who know @entity35 best and before senator @entity117 , 41 , of @entity118 , one of the party ’s new generations of stars			2
describing @entity35 as ' a stellar businessman ' @entity0 said : ' when somebody does not do the job we 've got ta let them go ... we do n’t have to be masochists and vote for someone we do n't like just because they seem to be nice			1
' responding to shouts from the crowd of ' @entity134 ' - his ' @entity131 ' catchphrase - he ended by saying : ' i 'll start it , you finish it			0
go ahead ... ' and the crowd roared : ' make my day ! ' ready to run : @entity138 and wife @entity39 stand alongside @entity37 and @entity35 after he gave his acceptance speech the ticket : @entity138 and @entity35 waved at the adoring crowds after he finished the speech there had been earlier speculation that the ' mystery guest ' could be @entity146 , @entity147 or even a hologram of @entity149			2
but @entity71 sources then confirmed that @entity0 would be the surprise new gunslinger in town for @entity35			2
the news that @entity0 , mayor of @entity16 from 1986 to 1988 , is the man who could make @entity35 's day produced a frisson of excitement among delegates eager to see the " @entity131 ” star and @entity107 - winning director of @entity159 and @entity160			1
@entity0 has kept a low political profile in recent years , but came under fire in february when he appeared in a @entity164 ad that declared : ' it 's halftime in @entity165			2
' ' halftime in @entity165 ' : @entity0 was featured in a controversial @entity164 ad this year that was blasted as a booster for the @entity4 campaign @entity71 pundits blasted @entity0 , saying that the @entity172 star was sticking up for @entity4 's auto industry bailout			1
@entity0 has had a low profile politically in recent years but backed @entity176 @entity175 in 2008 , and endorsed @entity35 earlier this month at a fundraiser in @entity178 , @entity11			2
' now more than ever do we need @entity35 , i 'm going to be voting for him , ’ the @entity107 winner said as the @entity35 stood next to him , beaming , on august 4 .			0

action star and director @entity0 gave a light and funny speech at the convention
used an empty chair where he pretended president @entity4 was sitting as a comedic foil during his short speech
' when somebody does not do their job , we got ta let them go '
