by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:04 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 13:49 est , 21 may 2013 @entity2 suggested gay marriage should be extended to family members to avoid inheritance tax @entity2 has launched a foul - mouthed attack on @entity7 , claiming the @entity9 leader has ‘ f * * * * * things up ’ by pressing ahead with gay marriage laws			1
the former party chairman ’s extraordinary public criticism of the current leadership emerged after the prime minister was forced to rely on @entity18 support to rescue same - sex weddings			1
@entity2 said the plans would create inconsistencies , and could be extended to help families avoid inheritance tax , declaring : ‘ maybe i ’d be allowed to marry my son			1
’ but the plans to legalise gay marriage have tonight cleared the @entity27 , despite efforts by @entity9 backbenchers to derail the legislation			1
there was applause in the @entity33 after mps voted by 366 to 161 , a majority of 205 , to give the @entity37 a third reading			0
the legislation will go to the @entity33 after the half - term recess where it is expected to attract fierce opposition from peers , especially the bishops			2
tonight 's result is a marginal improvement for mr @entity7 on the vote at second reading when 175 mps opposed the plans in a @entity27 vote			1
it also comes as a relief for @entity51 following a serious attempt yesterday by @entity9 former minister @entity53 to derail the @entity37			1
mr @entity53 had tabled an amendment extending civil partnerships to straight couples - a move which ministers warned could have cost the @entity59 an extra £ 4 billion in pension liabilities and scupper the chances of the @entity37 becoming law			0
but @entity18 - mindful they did not want to play any part in derailing the @entity37 - decided against supporting mr @entity53 - a move which would have seen the amendment pass - and offered the government an 11th hour deal to immediately review the possibility of extending civil partnerships to straight couples			0
culture secretary @entity71 accepted their amendment and mr @entity53 's amendment in the end was easily defeated			0
mr @entity7 ’s leadership has been under sustained criticism for weeks , unable to suppress @entity9 mutiny over @entity79 and gay marriage			1
last night he wrote to party activists to build bridges with them after a senior @entity9 figure reportedly called them ‘ mad , swivel - eyed loons ’			1
in an interview with the @entity86 said ministers had alienated traditional @entity9 voters			1
a new opinion poll last night put @entity96 just two points behind the conservatives			1
@entity2 added : ‘ if [ @entity96 ] make significant gains in the @entity79 elections , i know there ’s people rich enough to get involved and fund a significant campaign at a general election			2
’ discussing the impact of legalising gay marriage , @entity2 suggested it be extended to family members			1
he said : ‘ it ’s like one of my colleagues said : we ’ve got to make these same - sex marriages available to all			0
it would lift my worries about inheritance tax because maybe i ’d be allowed to marry my son			1
why not ? ‘ why should n’t a mother marry her daughter ? why should n’t two elderly sisters living together marry each other ? i quite fancy my brother ! ’ @entity2 also questioned whether the gay marriage laws could cause chaos when combined with changes to the rules of succession , which would allow an older female heir to the throne to become monarch			1
‘ i said to a minister i know : “ have you thought this through ? because you ’re doing the law of succession , too			0
” ‘ when we have a queen who is a lesbian and she marries another lady and then decides she would like to have a child and someone donates sperm and she gives birth to a child , is that child heir to the throne ? ’ lord @entity2 later admitted he had sworn during the interview			0
‘ it ’s not the language i normally use , but during a long interview i may well have said it , ’ he told @entity153			0
mr @entity7 issued a love letter to @entity9 activists last night as @entity96 closed to within two points in the opinion polls			1
the peace offering followed revelations that a senior ally of the prime minister had branded the party faithful ‘ swivel - eyed loons ’			2
@entity167 warn that his leadership is in peril amid discontent on @entity79 and gay marriage			0
the scale of the crisis was shown last night by a new poll that puts the @entity175 down five points on just 24 per cent , 11 behind @entity18			0
@entity96 – up six points in a month – was on 22 per cent , double the level of @entity180 support			2
in his email to party members , mr @entity7 said : ‘ we have been together through good times and bad			2
this is more than a working relationship ; it is a deep and lasting friendship			0
’ referring to reports that @entity9 co-chairman @entity188 – a tennis partner of mr @entity7 – had insulted them , he added : ‘ i am proud to lead this party			2
i am proud of what you do			0
and i would never have around me those who sneered or thought otherwise			0
‘ we are a team , from the parish council to the local association to @entity196 , and i never forget it			0
’ the dire poll ratings will fuel the discontent of @entity9 mps who warned yesterday the number prepared to force a leadership election has risen in recent days			2
if 46 write letters to @entity205 , chairman of the backbench @entity206 , there would be a vote of no confidence in mr @entity7 .			0
