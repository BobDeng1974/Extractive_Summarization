a survey published last week revealed that women who breastfeed their children beyond the age of 12 months are often made to feel ' uncomfortable ' about their decision			1
the research , published in @entity6 , revealed extended breastfeeding was n't seen as ' normal ' and less than one per cent of @entity9 mothers are still exclusively breastfeeding a six - month - old			1
however , in other countries around the world , breastfeeding is commonplace well into a child 's time as a toddler			2
meanwhile , the @entity29 recommend mothers carry on breastfeeding until a child is two and beyond ( alongside introducing them to other foods )			1
they state : ' breast milk is an important source of energy and nutrients in children aged six to 23 months			0
it can provide half or more of a child 's energy needs between the ages of six and 12 months , and one third of energy needs between 12 and 24 months			2
' the health benefits of breastfeeding include protecting a child from serious illness and setting them up for a bright future - research has shown that children and adolescents that have been breastfed perform better in intelligence tests			1
@entity9 mother , @entity18 , has found extended breastfeeding extremely beneficial for both her and her two daughters			1
the 24 - year - old from @entity60 breastfed her first daughter until she was aged three - and - a - half and is still breastfeeding her second daughter at 14 months			1
she told @entity63 : ' i feel my children have benefited greatly from breastfeeding and from extended breastfeeding			1
@entity18 's eldest daughter breastfed till she was three - and - a - half ' my first daughter is strongly attached to me and we have a great bond			1
it also helped with bonding with her sister as they used to feed together			2
she did n't feel pushed out either because of this			1
' she added that she takes comfort from the fact women who breastfeed are less likely to get breast and ovarian cancer , while it 's often more convenient than bottle feeding			2
she said : ' people are a little surprised ( that i carried on breastfeeding ) but mostly because i " must be exhausted "			2
quite the opposite , i find breastfeeding to be the lazy person 's choice			2
' @entity90 , 46 , of @entity91 , @entity92 , also breastfed her children until they were two			1
she said : ' both were picky eaters and refused to drink water or cows milk so they were at least getting some nutrition from my breast milk			0
also it was wonderful for the bonding side of things			0
i do n't regret it at all			2
' another advocate is @entity105 , 30 , who is still breastfeeding her son , @entity106 , 23 months			2
she told @entity63 : ' i chose to continue breastfeeding for the many health benefits that it afforded both my son and myself			1
for example , reduced risks of diabetes , asthma , cancers , the list goes on			0
that was very important to me			0
' but also breastfeeding has taught me to be a considerate and attached mother , it has taught me to listen to what my son wants and to be sensitive to his needs			2
as such i believe he is not ready to wean and wo n't force that upon him			0
' in the @entity127 study , many women revealed that , at certain times , they had been made to feel ashamed for breastfeeding			1
@entity18 said she was lucky to never experience any animosity when she was breastfeeding her toddlers in public			1
@entity90 agreed but she said her actions still attracted " unsolicited advice "			1
she explains : ' people would say i was being indulgent and it was more about my needs than the kids			0
' one friend even wagged her finger at my toddler while i was nursing her and said : " you 're a big girl now			0
you 're too old for that " which i found beyond irritating			0
' after that , i got a little self - conscious breastfeeding in public once the kids got beyond about 18 months but refused to get pushed into stopping before my children were ready			0
' @entity105 added : ' i can understand why it makes people a bit uncomfortable			0
it 's not an every day sight in the @entity9 and despite being very pro " natural term breastfeeding " i have often found it awkward and difficult to talk about with my peers			1
' but the benefits my son and i both receive really do outweigh any negativity i 've received			0
it 's my personal choice and our personal journey and one that i would try to repeat if i have any other children			0
' celebrities including @entity168 and @entity169 are among those in the public eye who have continued to breastfeed their children beyond 12 months			0
but despite such high profile support and the multiple health benefits , some women feel unable to carry on breastfeeding			1
a campaign poster in @entity23 encouraged women to keep breastfeeding their toddlers dr @entity182 an epidemiologist at the @entity184 ( @entity185 ) in @entity186 , @entity181 said women who want to breastfeed should be given more support			0
she led a study , published this month , which found those who were breastfed as babies were far less likely to have ear , sinus or throat infections later in childhood			0
she said the @entity195 ( @entity195 ) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for an infant 's first six months , followed by continued breastfeeding until at least 12 months			0
but she added : ' mothers need to be supported by health care professionals , their workplaces and communities to follow @entity204 recommendations on breastfeeding			1
