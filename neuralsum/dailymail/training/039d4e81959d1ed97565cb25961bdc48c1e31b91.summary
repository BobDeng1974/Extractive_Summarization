officials in southern @entity1 spent friday serving eviction papers on the first of possibly dozens of homes in @entity6 ' polygamous sect			1
the residents are among dozens of families who have failed to pay $ 100 - a - month occupancy fees for years , depriving the trust of more than $ 4 million			1
loyal followers of @entity6 have refused to pay , arguing they should n't have to give the state money for homes they built and maintained			1
but friday signaled the start of a widespread crackdown , starting with 14 homes selected at random			1
evictions : at least 14 polygamous families have been evicted from the @entity21 settlement in @entity1 after they refused to pay the $ 100 - a - month occupancy fees to authorities			1
the residents owe a combined total of $ 4m the evictions went smoothly and without major confrontation — but it was painstakingly slow changing locks and clearing rooms at large homes built for multiple wives and dozens of children			1
by 4pm they still had four homes left			2
@entity36 , a @entity37 constable who oversaw the evictions , said : ' there are so many darn doors with all the wives			2
they each have to have their own way in and out			0
' one house had 75 doors , she said			2
most of the homes were empty or had just a few people there to monitor things , @entity36 said			2
' they knew this was coming , ' she said			0
' they were pretty cooperative			0
' the evictions were the first since @entity1 took control of a trust in 2005 due to allegations of mismanagement by @entity6 and other sect leaders			1
jailed : @entity6 is the former leader of the extremist @entity62 sect which brands itself the @entity65			1
he is serving a life sentence for sex abuse the trust , created by the @entity62 sect in 1942 , has more than 700 homes and properties valued at more than $ 100 million in @entity21 , @entity1 , and @entity72 , @entity73			1
@entity1 state judge @entity74 ordered the evictions this summer , saying she was fed up with a free - rider problem in the community			1
@entity74 hoped the evictions would send a message and prompt people to pay up			0
@entity80 , a spokesman for officials appointed by the judge to oversee the trust , said it 's too early to tell if that will happen			0
out of 26 homes in the first batch given initial notices in july , only 12 agreed to pay			2
evictions of seven additional homes are expected within weeks			0
next year , dozens more homes could face the same fate			0
the evictions were served on houses , rather than people , due to uncertainty surrounding who lives in them , @entity80 said			0
' they move people around so frequently and so often that they could be in another home with another family , ' he said of @entity6 ' group , known as @entity65			2
the sect is a radical offshoot of mainstream @entity105 whose members believe polygamy brings exaltation in heaven			0
polygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of @entity113 , but the mainstream church and its 15 million members worldwide abandoned the practice in 1890 and strictly prohibit it			0
@entity6 is serving a life sentence in a @entity119 prison after being convicted of sexually assaulting underage girls whom he considered wives			1
but he 's reported to still lead the sect from prison			0
the fact that the homes had been vacated and no women and children had to be removed — and no fights broke out — came as a relief for state officials			1
' it is very good news for us , ' @entity80 said			0
' we just hope the rest of them will go as smooth			0

state of @entity1 took over @entity21 compound after @entity6 was jailed
but leaders told families not to pay the $ 100 - a - month occupancy fee
officials spent 7 hours evicting fewer than 14 homes built for multiple wives
each wife has their own room , living space , *entrance* and exit doors
residents urged to pay the fee to avoid eviction , they owe $ 4m in total
