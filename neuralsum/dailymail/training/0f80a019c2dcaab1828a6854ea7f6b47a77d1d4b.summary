@entity1 midfielder @entity0 has urged his team - mates to use their disappointment at @entity4 as extra motivation for a daunting double			1
the @entity7 lost 1 - 0 at @entity8 on saturday as their lack of cutting edge without the departed @entity11 and the injured @entity12 was exposed once again			1
however , they have little time to lick their wounds with a @entity17 trip to @entity18 looming on tuesday evening ahead of saturday 's visit of @entity21 leaders @entity22 to @entity23			1
@entity1 's @entity0 sees the trip to @entity18 on tuesday as a chance to rediscover form @entity0 told the club 's official website , www.liverpoolfc.com : ' they are two big games , two games to show that we can score goals and defend better			1
' we 'll look forward to that still			0
we 'll work hard during the week and put in two good performances , hopefully , against two top teams			2
' that , however , may be easier said than done with manager @entity35 admitting as he started to analyse an unproductive day on @entity36 that ' 80 per cent ' of last season 's goals had been taken out of his team with the absence of @entity42 double - act @entity11 and @entity12			1
@entity44 striker @entity43 celebrates scoring the winner as @entity4 beat @entity1 1 - 0 on saturday newcastle celebrate after @entity43 's goal inflicted @entity1 's fourth @entity21 defeat in ten games @entity1 enjoyed plenty of possession at @entity8 ' , particularly as midfield general @entity52 worked his way gradually higher up the pitch as the game wore on			1
however , with @entity61 static and @entity57 , who spent most of his afternoon wide on the right , largely becalmed by full - back @entity59 , home goalkeeper @entity56 had little of note to do			0
@entity4 always looked the more dangerous through the pace of @entity64 , until he tore a thigh muscle 23 minutes into the game , and then substitute @entity66 , @entity67 and the marauding @entity69			2
but it took them until the 73rd minute to find what proved to be the winner when substitute @entity74 capitalised on @entity76 's hesitation on the edge of his own six - yard box to hammer the ball past helpless keeper @entity80			0
@entity81 , who scored a 17th league goal at @entity83 on saturday , will look to help defeat @entity1 the @entity85 international then pulled off a superb save with his foot to deny @entity87 a second , but his efforts were to count for nothing in the end			1
@entity0 said : ' it was very disappointing			2
we came here for confidence and to get a result and we did n't manage to do that , so we 're very disappointed			0
' throughout the game , i thought we dominated the ball but we did n't really get in behind them or create many chances			0
' we had one or two through @entity102 and @entity103 from the corner , but overall , we 're disappointed not to get something out of the game			0
' i felt as though we started the game well and we quietened the crowd down , kept the ball			0
but the ball was n't the problem - we were dominating the game through possession , but it was just getting into that final third and creating an opening			0
@entity0 talks to striker @entity61 , who once again struggled to make an impact at @entity4 ' we struggled with that , so we 'll have to improve on that and kick on for the next game			1
' that next game - real at the @entity118 - could hardly be any more difficult with the @entity44 having won 3 - 0 on @entity119 at a canter on october 22 , and clear - cut chances are likely to be even more difficult to come by			1
however , @entity0 insists that is a collective responsibility despite the growing pressure on summer signing @entity61			2
he said : ' it 's down to the whole team , especially the midfielders and the attackers , to make runs in behind and create lots of options and movement and combination play as well			0
' i just thought we did n't do as well as we know we can , so we 'll have to improve			0

@entity1 put in a poor performance to lose 1 - 0 at @entity4 on saturday
@entity35 ' side face @entity18 in the @entity17 on tuesday before *hosting* @entity21 leaders @entity22 this saturday
@entity0 sees the tricky double as motivation to respond
@entity1 are currently 7th in the league , 12 points behind @entity22
