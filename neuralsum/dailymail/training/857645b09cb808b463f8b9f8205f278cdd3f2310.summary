gruesome details emerged today that allegedly show how the naked body of @entity3 socialite @entity2 was stuffed into a suitcase and was then caught on security footage being carried to a taxi by one of her suspected killers			1
outlining the case against the widow 's pregnant daughter @entity12 and her boyfriend @entity14 , police said the evidence was ' overwhelming			1
' they say the 62 - year - old was folded into the silver - coloured case , with her back arched forward at an almost impossible angle and her legs bent up around the sides of her head			1
but because she had been lowered into the 3ft - long suitcase on her side , the lid would not close completely over the body of the murdered 5ft 5in woman			1
in a panic , her alleged killers wrapped the suitcase in a sheet and pulled the cloth tight around it in the hope that it would disguise the fact that it was not closed			1
we thought we would give them some @entity3 food and they would be grateful , ' said the commander @entity79			0
' so today they are eating rice - based local food			0
' police sources in @entity40 revealed that , contrary to earlier reports , the murder had occurred in room 317 - not 616 - which was being shared by mrs @entity2 and her daughter at the luxury beachside @entity88 in the upmarket @entity91 region of the holiday island			1
@entity94 's boyfriend was staying in room 616 - and it was from that room , in the early hours of tuesday , august 12 , that @entity14 , dressed in dark clothing , was seen on the hotel ’s security cameras stepping out into the corridor and taking the lift down to the third floor			1
the alleged killers - her 19 - year - old pregnant daughter @entity12 and the teenager 's 21 - year - old boyfriend @entity14 - wrapped the suitcase in a sheet to disguise the fact that it was not closed , police say suspects : @entity12 ( pictured , left , in custody ) and her boyfriend @entity14 ( right ) are accused of murdering @entity94 's mother @entity116 in a five - star hotel on the island of @entity40 he entered room 317 - it is not known if he knocked or whether he had access to the keycard - but some time later he is seen later allegedly lugging the suitcase on his shoulder as he steps out of the room			1
he decides not to take the lift - perhaps because he might meet other guests - and makes his way up the stairs to his own room			0
but in his haste , he made an error and found himself on the seventh floor and had to make his way back down one floor , police claim			2
police who have studied the security camera sequences have noted that @entity14 was totally alone in the stairway , but it has not been revealed what time of the early morning he was moving between the third and sixth floors			2
he is then believed to have packed his own belongings and changed his clothes , including putting on a red and yellow jacket , before asking a bell boy to come up collect the luggage on a trolley			0
security footage shows the bell boy walking a luggage trolly through the plush lobby , the sheet - covered suitcase lying under other bags			2
@entity14 walks beside the trolley and it is he who lifts the case into the boot of a waiting taxi before returning to the hotel with his girlfriend			1
@entity94 : @entity12 ( with towel on head ) is served @entity163 ( right of picture ) after complaining that @entity63 was based on a ' racist ' assumption that she 'd like fried chicken at that stage , no - one appears to have noticed anything wrong , but when @entity14 and his girlfriend fail to come back out the taxi driver strolls around to the boot and notices blood			1
security officials tell him to drive immediately to the main police headquarters in the area , in @entity69 , where stunned officers discover the @entity3 woman 's body , head and hair covered in blood , when they open the suitcase			2
mrs @entity2 was found lying on her left side , her blonde hair covering most of the right side of her @entity187 apparently died when blood blocked her airways after her face had been neaten so hard			2
brute strength appears to have been required to ' fold ' mrs @entity2 into the suitcase , police said			1
police are expected to produce court photographs of the savage injuries mrs @entity2 received to her face , which appears to have sustained a number of heavy blows			2
despite police sources stating earlier that she had been hit with a glass ashtray , the object was described today as looking like an ashtray but which was more ' ornamental '			1
at @entity69 police headquarters today , commander @entity79 , said the evidence of murder against @entity94 and @entity14 was ' overwhelming ' - and he cited one good reason for it			1
if the murder had occurred in a cheaper hotel , which does not have such a sophisticated security system , the police , he admitted would not have a step - by - step replay of a murder			2
he insisted that the actual footage from the security cameras and still photographs taken from the security sequences were ' off the record ' and would not be made public until the murder case gets under way through the courts			2
' we have the movements of all three parties in the public areas of the hotel - including the stairways - from the second they checked in on separate days , ' he said in a reference to the mother and daughter arriving two days before @entity14			1
accused : @entity94 ( pictured ) has told her lawyer that she has been sexually assaulted ' multiple times ' behind bars			0
@entity238 said she was unsure whether it was allegedly at the hands of prison guards or inmates there is evidence , as @entity246 has previously reported , of the mother and daughter arguing over who should pay for @entity14 's room , number 616 , and there is the floor - by - floor playback of the man hoisting the suitcase from the murder room to his own			1
commander @entity79 , who appeared to leave little doubt about his confidence that the case against @entity94 and her boyfriend is watertight , said : ' the evidence , put together from fingerprints , security footage , the behaviour of the suspects , all lead us to believe we have the right people in custody			1
' @entity94 and her boyfriend are likely to be in custody for many weeks before they are brought to court and formally charged , said commander @entity79			0
the pair are then expected to be moved to the notorious @entity276 as they are taken through the laborious @entity279 justice system			0
along the way , @entity94 , who is nearly two months pregnant , will probably give birth to her baby while in custody and the question will then arise as to whether the child should be placed in the care of relatives or friends in the @entity3 asked about suggestions that an alleged crime pending against one or both of the couple in the @entity3 could result in them being extradited to be dealt with there first , commander @entity79 shook his head			0
' we are n’t taking that into consideration			0
they are under arrest here			0
they will be dealt with here			0
' aside from security camera footage that allegedly implicates the two @entity3 in mrs @entity2 ’s murder , commander @entity79 said police have taken statements from 16 witnesses			1
' and that ’s so far , ' he said			0
@entity12 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) face death by firing squad if they are convicted the pair , who have not been charged , continue to refuse to talk to investigating officers , insisting on a lawyer travelling from the @entity3 to replace the police lawyer who has been designated to liaise with them , although it is understood she is not getting far with them			1
@entity94 has complained to a @entity3 attorney who reached her by phone that she has been physically and sexually assaulted , a complaint that commander @entity79 brushed aside as being ' completely untrue '			0
the 19 - year - old is not sure whether it was fellow inmates or guards who molested her , her @entity325 attorney @entity238 told @entity246			0
' it is very disconcerting , ' he said			0
' she initially thought it was fellow inmates , but now she has discovered that not all the guards are wearing official uniforms			0
' there is nothing else for the pair to do , said the commander			0
they glance through a newspaper but otherwise , said the commander , they have no other form of entertainment			0
police claim the couple initially told them that they been taken captive at the @entity348 by an armed gang who killed mrs @entity2			2
they said they managed to escape the gang ’s clutches and fled to the hotel in the @entity69 area of @entity40 .			0
