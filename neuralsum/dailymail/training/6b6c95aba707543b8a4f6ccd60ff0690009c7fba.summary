seven years after the financial crisis that shook @entity3 and unleashed a wave of debt carnage , many @entity1 cities have never recovered			1
@entity1 's once - proud industrial heartlands , once home to large middle - class communities , now lie practically in ruins , while areas that have always had problems with poverty face an ever - greater climb to prosperity			1
in some , whole neighborhoods lie crumbling , foreclosed and vacant after the eviction of legions of subprime borrowers			2
in others , jobless rates have soared and incomes plummeted , leaving those left behind struggling to eke out a living			1
@entity25 - based online research group @entity24 has now compiled a list of the @entity1 cities with the biggest communities of poor people , ranked by the percentage of households making less than $ 25,000 a year			1
the data is from the the @entity33 , released in december by the @entity34			0
@entity35 , @entity36 once an economic powerhouse thanks to its famous auto industry , @entity35 's decline began long before the @entity1 housing bubble burst as car makers fled to cheaper destinations overseas			1
between 2000 and 2010 the city 's population fell by 25 percent , changing its ranking from the nation 's 10th - largest city to 18th			1
as a result , many neighborhoods now lie abandoned			0
in 2013 the city declared bankruptcy , becoming the largest @entity1 city ever to do so			0
@entity53 , @entity54 @entity53 is another victim of @entity1 's shift to a post-industrial economy			0
previously the workshop which made many of @entity1 's most - iconic products , including saddles , tractors and motors , @entity53 's collapse has taken decades and is still taking it 's toll on the city , where poverty rates soared close to 30 per cent in the throes of the past recession			1
@entity70 , @entity71 @entity1 's fifth-most populous city , and an iconic part of the nation 's revolutionary history , @entity70 began its economic decline in the 1950s , when industrial restructuring led to the loss of many middle - class jobs and a gradual exodus of nearly a quarter of its population			1
in recent years gentrification and a expanding tourist and service industries have led to some revitalization of the centre , but many parts remain desperately poor			1
@entity89 , @entity90 with nearly half the city 's children living below the poverty line , @entity89 is one of the worst @entity1 cities to grow up in			1
but the economic fate of the city 's people depends in large part on the colour of their skin : a report last year by @entity104 at the @entity89 noted that nearly a third of blacks and almost half of @entity108 in the city live below the poverty line , compared to just one in ten whites			1
even as overall poverty rates in the city declined last year , the rates among children and @entity108 have increased , ms @entity104 reported			2
and the racial gap is widening : ' an interesting observation is that poverty rates among non-hispanic whites are now much lower in @entity89 and @entity120 than in the state or the nation as a whole , ' dr @entity104 wrote			0
@entity124 , @entity125 @entity124 was hard particularly hard by the @entity126 , with jobless rates almost tripling between 2007 and 2010 , according to @entity125 state government data			0
between 2007 and 2011 poverty rates rose nearly 8 percentage points to 26.6 percent , well above the 15.3 percent national average			2
@entity132 , @entity133 with one in ten of working age people unemployed , a high cost of living and a low growth rate , @entity132 has become one of the hardest cities to survive in			1
@entity139 , professor at the @entity140 , told the @entity141 several years ago that working poor are ' everywhere ' in the city			2
' they 're not just people living in shelters , ' she said			2
' they 're the person who poured your coffee			0
... they 're cleaning your office when you 're not there			0
@entity154 , @entity25 essentially a massive farming town , @entity154 has always been dependent on low - paying agricultural labour			0
just one in five of people over 25 have a college degree , while nearly a quarter never even finished high school			1
that means massive disparity between the haves and the have - nots			0
' if you own a farm , you 're apt to earn more wealth , while if you 're a farm worker , your do n't earn very much , ' said @entity168 , executive director of the @entity169 in an @entity171 interview in 2012			0
at that time , @entity154 had the second highest poverty rates in the whole @entity1			0
@entity173 , @entity174 a city of migrants , seven in 10 of @entity173 citizens over five speak a language other than @entity179 at home , reports the @entity34 , while one in four were born overseas			0
more than 20 per cent of peope live in poverty			2
@entity183 , @entity184 another city battered by the financial crisis , the number of children living in poverty in @entity183 has soared by more than 40percent since 2005 , reports the @entity190			0
meanwhile , social mobility statistics render the @entity192 a joke for many people in the city , with just a 4.9percent chance that a person born into the poorest fifth of the income distribution will make it into the richest fifth			2
@entity202 , @entity203 although close to half the city 's working - age adults have a college degree , @entity202 has a poverty rate well above the national average - a situation that has only become worse in many of the city 's poorest neighborhoods			2
it is the fourth-most unequal big city in the whole of the @entity1 , with the richest 5percent earning more than 15 times the income of the poorest fifth			0
low wages blight @entity202 's economy , with 41 per cent of its people earning below a @entity220 ' low - wage definition of $ 30,600 a year - mostly those in retail , health and social care and education			1
