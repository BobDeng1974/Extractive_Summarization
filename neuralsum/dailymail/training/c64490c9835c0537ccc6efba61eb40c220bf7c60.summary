@entity0 has set aside ten hours in its @entity2 schedule to air an adaptation of @entity5 ’s nineteenth century novel @entity4 there was once a time when a ten - hour radio show based on a work of @entity11 literature would have been a daunting prospect even the most loyal listener			1
but @entity0 bosses are taking advantage in the boom of online listening and downloadable podcasts by handing over almost the entire @entity2 schedule for @entity0 to a production of @entity4			1
and the adaptation of @entity5 ’s nineteenth century novel is the flagship of the station ’s @entity24 line - up , that will also see the characters of @entity28 put on a full production of @entity31 ’s @entity30 and the archbishop of canterbury @entity32 submit himself to analysis on @entity35			1
@entity36 , @entity0 ’s @entity37 , said yesterday that before the availability of online catch - up he would not have felt confident commissioning a programme on the scale of @entity4			1
he said : ‘ [ podcasts and online listening have ] changed the way we commissioned dramas			0
' ten years ago , we would have been slightly reluctant to do a ten - part classic serial but because we now advertise [ catch - up listening ] as available and it ’s there for 30 days , it means if you ’ve missed something you can go back and that ’s emboldened us to commission big			1
' it ’s kind of like the box set philosophy , it ’s available when you want it , as well as on air			0
’ @entity4 , widely regard as one of the most important works in literature , tells the story of the @entity64 invasion of @entity11 and the impact of the @entity67 era on @entity69 society through the eyes of five aristocratic families			2
the event will be the first time @entity0 has handed over so much of its schedule to one production on a single day , with @entity4 running from 9am to 9.30pm giving way only to news bulletins , @entity28 and an as of yet unannounced comedy programme			1
in 2003 , the novel was listed at number 20 on the @entity0 ’s survey @entity82 , which sought to find the country ’s best loved novel			2
mr @entity36 said : ‘ it ’s the biggest blockbuster of them all , so why do n’t we do it in the biggest blockbuster way ? ' so that ’s why we ’ve stripped out the schedule on a day when we think people will be prepared to sit down and listen to something			0
' one of the things i love about @entity0 is we will give something the space to do something like that properly , 10 hours is a pretty good stab at @entity4 ’			2
the ten - hour radio show is a production based on the works of @entity11 novelist @entity5 ( pictured ) @entity107 , the station ’s controller , added : ‘ we hope lots of @entity0 listeners will set themselves up with vodka and blinis and dip in and out			1
so , the reason for doing it is because it ’s arguably the best book ever written and if you have n’t made the journey through it , @entity0 thinks you are really missing out ’			0
the production will star big names such as @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 and took a month to record			0
@entity36 added it had ‘ all the logistics of a film shoot because it was so big ’ , even attending a re-enactment of @entity126 – a major event in the 1,300 page book – in order to record realistic battle sounds			0
it is being produced by the award - winning director @entity131 , who said : ‘ i ’ve been obsessed with @entity4 ever since i can remember			2
' i read it first in @entity64 , then in @entity135 and i even tried to read in in @entity11 – i think i managed about a page			0
i was living at that time in @entity137 with a princess @entity138 who would talk about the book as if it were a family memoir			0
@entity36 added : ‘ the place @entity5 has in the @entity11 imagination makes @entity143 look like a @entity144 - come - lately in the @entity135 imagination ’			2
the production will also be accompanied by an online digital companion , providing family trees , historical facts and maps to help listeners keep up with the complicated plotlines			0
@entity4 will be the longest drama @entity0 has rolled out in a single day			1
however , they have previously undertaken similar ventures on a lesser scale			0
on @entity158 in 2000 the station cleared its schedule for an eight - hour reading of @entity162 ’s @entity161 and , in 2012 , there was a five and a half hour production of @entity165 ’s @entity164 .			1
