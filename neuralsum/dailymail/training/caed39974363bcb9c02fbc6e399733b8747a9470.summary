by @entity0 @entity1 : 16:17 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:18 est , 27 december 2013 a nine - year - old boy from @entity4 has become the youngest person in recorded history to reach the summit of @entity10 's @entity9 mountain , which at 22,841 feet is the tallest peak in the @entity12 and @entity4 hemispheres			1
@entity14 of @entity15 reached the summit on christmas eve with his father @entity17 and a @entity19 sherpa , @entity20 , his team announced friday			1
when they climbed back down to the base camp , @entity14 was much less tired than his dad and their guide , said @entity26 , who handled the expedition 's logistics from the city of @entity30			1
@entity31 ( left ) sits with his son @entity14 ( right ) at the peak of @entity34 in @entity4 - but they have just reached the summit of @entity10 's @entity9 mountain ' it 's a record			1
never before has a child as young as nine reached the summit of @entity9 , ' @entity26 said			2
there was one younger boy who climbed the lower slopes of @entity9 , @entity26 noted : an @entity44 boy was sacrificed some 500 years ago at 16,400 feet ( 5,300 meters ) on @entity45 , one of the mountain 's lower peaks			1
scientific tests on the mummy , recovered in 1985 , put his age at about 7			0
only 30 percent of the 7,000 people who obtain permits to climb @entity9 each year make the summit , @entity26 said , and no one under 14 is usually allowed			2
the @entity56 hired a lawyer to make their case before an @entity10 judge that @entity14 could safely accomplish the feat. @entity10 's @entity9 ( pictured ) , is the tallest peak in the @entity12 and @entity4 hemispheres at 22,841 feet he had already climbed the 19,341 - foot @entity64			1
@entity65 in @entity66 at the age of 8 , and with @entity9 conquered , is determined to reach all ' seven summits ' , the highest mountains on each of the seven continents			2
last year , three climbers died , although no one died the year before that , and no one has been killed so far this summer climbing season , @entity26 said			0
since the first climbers reached the top of @entity9 in 1897 , more than 110 people have died trying , he said			0
' @entity14 is a really happy kid , very open			0
and he 's prepared for these climbs very carefully , ' @entity26 said			0
' neither he nor his father are in for ' adventure			0
' their project is pretty conservative , with a guide who is very experienced , so from my perspective , their climb was n't imprudent			0

@entity10 's @entity9 mountain is 22,841 feet tall
@entity14 mounted the summit with his father on @entity95
