by @entity1 reporter published : 22:49 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 23:27 est , 31 october 2013 @entity3 's highest court threw out a wrongful death verdict today over the 2007 university massacre that killed 32 people			1
the case had been brought by the families of two students - @entity10 and @entity11 - who argued that the women might have survived if @entity14 administrators had alerted students earlier about the gunman			1
the @entity17 concluded however , that the university did not have a duty to warn students after the bodies of two students were found in a dormitory			1
victims : @entity25 , left , and @entity26 were among those killed in the mass shooting at @entity14 the justices agreed with the state , saying there was no way to anticipate student @entity34 's deadly intentions			1
' thus , as a matter of law , the commonwealth did not have a duty to protect students against third party criminal acts , ' the court wrote			1
jurors in @entity44 ruled in march last year that the state was negligent in the deaths of @entity47 , 18 , and miss @entity11 , 23 , who were killed in the deadliest mass shooting in modern @entity50 history			0
jurors had awarded the families of both students $ 4 million each , but a judge reduced the award to the state cap of $ 100,000 for each family			2
campus safety advocates have said the decision will not shake the heightened diligence at @entity50 universities , saying improved security is the ' living legacy ' of the victims			1
' the april 16 , 2007 , tragedy forever changed campus safety , ' said @entity66 , director of 32 @entity67 , named for the number of @entity14 victims			1
@entity71 gunman : the @entity17 ruled the university had no way of knowing @entity34 's deadly intentions devastation : the mass shooting at @entity14 killed 32 people in 2007 ' this court ruling does nothing to diminish that , ' he said			1
since the killings , campuses have instituted warning systems that use cell phone alerts and sirens			2
' we draw strength knowing that the 32 innocent lives tragically lost were not in vain , ' the @entity87 , a nonprofit established by the families of victims and survivors , said in a statement			1
' institutions , including @entity14 , now often have mass notifications out to their entire campus within minutes rather than hours after any serious incident occurs			2
' in thursday 's decision , the justices reversed a jury 's findings and issued a final ruling , meaning there is no avenue for appeal			0
in response , the state attorney general 's office said in a statement that the court ' found what we have said all along to be true '			2
spokesman @entity114 wrote in an email : ' the commonwealth and its officials at @entity14 were not negligent on april 16 , 2007			0
@entity34 was the lone person responsible for this tragedy			0
' the case was the lone pending legal action from the massacre , mr @entity114 said			0
at the trial in the case last year jurors found that the state should have issued more timely campus warnings after the dormitory shooting			2
the trial focused on the time between the first shootings , shortly after 7am , and the killings at @entity130 , shortly before 10am			0
a campus - wide email at 9:50am warned of a gunman and advised students to remain inside			0
by then , @entity34 had chained the @entity130 doors and continued with his massacre			0
the state argued that law enforcement officials believed the first shootings were the result of a domestic dispute , and had concluded the larger campus was n't at risk			1
reflection : @entity14 staff and a student pause at a memorial for the victims			0
universities have brought in warning systems since the attack the justices concluded that university officials acted properly			1
the @entity153 and @entity154 are the only families of @entity14 victims who did not join an $ 11 million settlement			1
their attorneys have shielded the families from the media , but they have said they were intent on holding university officials accountable for their actions on april 16 , 2007			2
the state was the only defendant at trial			0
in a statement , @entity14 president @entity166 , extended his gratitude to state attorneys who argued the appeal			0
a university statement said the ruling ' can never reverse the loss of lives nor the pain experienced by so many families and friends of victims of one person '			1
@entity180 , whose son @entity181 was wounded in the attack , said he found the ruling upsetting			0
' i think it certainly takes the pressure off universities , ' he wrote in an email to @entity188			0
' i would hope that all future freshman orientations clearly spell out that , despite all the policy changes and advanced notification systems , the university actually has no " duty " to use them			2
let 's see how parents react to that			0

court rules university did not have duty to issue warning after finding first victims
families of @entity25 and @entity26 had argued the women could have survived if the campus had reacted *faster* to the shootings
