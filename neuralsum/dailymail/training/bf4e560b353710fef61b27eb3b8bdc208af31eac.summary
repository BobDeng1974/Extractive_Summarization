by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 defender @entity2 is confident he can slot perfectly into @entity6 's first - team plans this season			1
@entity7 has made it clear he wants @entity3 to line up in the 5 - 3 - 2 formation he used during the latter stages of the @entity11 with @entity12			1
with only three centre - halves on his books , @entity7 has already admitted he needs reinforcements			1
@entity2 started 21 @entity41 games last term under @entity43 , but he has looked sharp in both friendlies on @entity3 's tour of the @entity46 and he thinks @entity7 's system suits him well			1
@entity2 said : ' being part of that formation means you have a lot of responsibility			1
' we really have to go out there and attack and be nice and aggressive			0
i would like to think that 's my game			2
' i played in a back three when i was younger , not since i turned professional , but we are all picking it up and enjoying it			2
' communication is key , but we get on well so that 's not really an issue			0
' impress me : @entity6 has stated that he is willing to give every member of @entity3 's squad a chance to show him what they can do @entity69 : @entity71 scores from long range to set @entity3 on their way to a 3 - 2 win over @entity75 in their latest pre-season friendly @entity7 maintained his 100 per cent record as @entity3 boss with a 3 - 2 win over @entity75 on saturday , but he was unhappy with his team 's performance in @entity82 , accusing them of wasting possession			1
despite having just three days ' rest after the @entity11 , @entity7 has wasted no time implementing the rules that he thinks will turn @entity3 into winners again			1
the players have been told they must speak @entity89 to each other in an attempt to improve communication on and off the pitch			0
rectangular tables have been replaced with circular ones in the dining halls on tour so the players are more likely to chat and bond over meals			0
tour plans have been amended so @entity3 stay in hotels near to their training facilities and @entity7 sits down with his coaches at 10:30pm every night to discuss the players ' progress			1
' it 's all down to fine details , ' @entity2 added			1
' he has the whole overview - on how we play , how we take set - plays , how we eat , how we rest			0
he has that all in hand			0
' transfer target : @entity3 have been linked with @entity36 centre - back @entity34 ( right ) as they seek to strengthen their defence not impressed : @entity7 was critical of @entity3 for being sloppy in possession during the @entity75 match @entity2 clearly admires his new manager greatly			1
' he is a man who requires a lot of respect and we give him that because of what he has done and what he is like , ' the @entity122 defender said			0
' we are all trying to impress him , whether it 's in training or in the hotel with how we conduct ourselves			0
' he is a man we can learn a lot from			0
' @entity2 admits the team should not be immune from criticism despite recording their second successive tour win			2
' at times we were a bit sloppy and we need to work on that to make sure that we tidy that up , ' he said			0
at the double : @entity71 celebrates his second goal of the match with @entity138 but there could be no criticism from @entity2 , or any of his team - mates , towards @entity71 , who scored a stunning curler from 25 yards to put @entity3 ahead in @entity143			1
' that 's what special players can do , ' @entity2 added			2
' he turns there and you think he has nowhere to go , but then it 's in the top corner			0
' it 's that kind of class we are going to need this year			0
' @entity3 flew to @entity154 on sunday ahead of their next match in the @entity156 against @entity157 , which takes place on tuesday .			2

defender believes he can easily fit in to @entity7 's plans at @entity3
@entity164 manager *favours* a 5 - 3 - 2 formation but needs defensive reinforcements
@entity2 played in @entity3 's latest pre-season fixture , a 3 - 2 win over @entity75
@entity3 have targeted @entity34 , @entity33 and @entity32 in transfer *market*
