three penalty appeals - which the referee does not feel are enough on their own to award a spot kick - should not add to a penalty kick but that ’s what appeared to benefit @entity6 and @entity7 in @entity8			1
@entity9 is used to players exaggerating and simulating in his native @entity11			0
he even knows @entity6 from @entity13 matches and he appeared to be prepared to wave aside theatrical falls during the game			2
the penalty which was given came from poor defending from the experienced @entity17 , who from his days at @entity18 should know better than to put his leg in the way of a player like @entity6			0
there was a much clearer incident which should have resulted in a penalty for @entity7 just before half time when @entity6 was perhaps caught by @entity17 but then wiped out by @entity45			1
@entity59 themselves had a clear penalty when @entity38 was through on goal and @entity43 flew in with a high boot to stop the @entity64			0
decider : @entity17 appeals after @entity6 goes down for the late penalty that won @entity7 the game big call : @entity6 tried to jink around @entity17 but appeared to be caught by @entity59 's captain difficult decision : @entity59 appeal - in vain - after @entity6 went down to win the stoppage time penalty influence : it was a big call for @entity9 with both sides appealing for a decision in their favour high risk : @entity17 was booked for the challenge that saw @entity9 award a late penalty to @entity7 two on one : @entity17 and @entity45 were both involved as @entity6 went down in the area ouch : @entity6 reacts after the challenge but he could not convince the referee decision : @entity9 elected not to award the @entity64 a penalty for this challenge by @entity43 @entity89 shot : @entity38 went down under the tough challenge but the referee deemed it not a penalty it had to be seen as dangerous play and in such situations if there is physical contact then a direct free kick , or penalty if it occurs in the 18 yard box , should be given			1
there was another penalty appeal in the 67th minute when @entity6 ( naturally ) threw himself to the ground but @entity9 rightly waved the appeals away			2
they say cheats never prosper but when referees merely wave aside dives insead of cautioning the cheat , then they will dive and dive again and often , as in this game , eventually ‘ win ’ penalties which are so crucial			0
painful : @entity38 falls to the ground as @entity43 looks on but no penalty was given by the referee still not happy : @entity6 and @entity9 have a chat during the first half cooling break respected : @entity9 was in charge of the 2012 @entity13 final and is highly regarded by @entity121			1

referee @entity9 should not have given @entity7 their late penalty
@entity7 ran out 2 - 1 winners after @entity127 converted the spot kick
@entity6 's theatrical fall decided the game in favour of the @entity36
two clear penalties could have been given in the first half
