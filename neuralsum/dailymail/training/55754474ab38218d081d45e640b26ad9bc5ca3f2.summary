@entity1 , who has been teaching yoga for years , has always kept her policy – cell phones turn off when her classes begin			1
but according to the @entity19 , ms @entity17 was let go last month after asking a @entity4 employee at the @entity22 campus to shut off her phone mid-class			1
the @entity4 employee complained to ms @entity1 ’ contracting company , @entity24 , who decided to terminate her			1
she said in the complaint that ms @entity1 glared at her , though the yoga instructor said it was nothing more than a ' disapproving look			2
' @entity24 said at the time : ‘ we are in the business of providing great customer service , ’ her notice read , according to the @entity19			2
‘ unless a client requires us to specifically say no to something , we prefer to say yes whenever possible			2
’ increasingly , yoga studios across the country have posted strict no - phone policies amid a new generation of smart phone users addicted to checking emails , @entity44 , the news , and @entity4			1
ms @entity1 said she initially asked all people in the class at @entity4 to turn off any electronic devices before she began			1
but the @entity4 employee in the front of the class could not bear to be out of the know for the entirety of the class , and attempted to check it halfway through the session			1
stretch it out : yoga instructor @entity58 , left , instructs students wednesday , july 11 , 2012 , at @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity22 though ms @entity1 said she only gave the employee a disapporiving look , that was enough for the worker to file a complaint			1
‘ i ’m sure my look said it all , ’ she told the paper			2
‘ really ? your email is more important than understanding your body ? ’ she told @entity72 : ' she just thought what was going on at work was more important than yoga , or being there at the time			2
it 's fine if you 've got something going on , life still happens , but you 're allowed to leave			0
' she said she thought it was the least disruptive way of handling it at the time			0
' i handled it how i handled it			0
' i do n’t think i did anything wrong			0
i have to stand by my beliefs			0
that ’s the kind of environment i want , and that ’s what i have to hold on to			0
' the yoga instructor has had brush - in ’s with tech - oriented clientele			1
at @entity97 , she had to tell an employee not to take pictures of fellow workers during class			1
nonstop : employees work at their computers at the @entity4 main campus in @entity12 , @entity22 ; ms @entity1 said that tech types are often too tightly wound for yoga representatives for @entity24 did not immediately respond to @entity72 ’s request for comment			1
@entity4 simply said : ' @entity58 was not an employee of @entity4 , so we are not able to discuss this matter			1
' @entity17 said losing the job meant losing a third of her monthly income			0
but she secured a part - time office job in the mornings , allowing her to teach yoga to children , small classes , and private clients			2
' i do n’t think i did anything wrong			0
i have to stand by my beliefs			0
that ’s the kind of environment i want , and that ’s what i have to hold on to			0
' she told @entity72 that in this day and age , many people could use the hour or so of silence that yoga allows			2
' i love to go in on lunchtime and give people that break			0
it ’s so rewarding to walk into an office , and they take an hour and they ’ve taken that time for themselves , ' she said			0
' i feel like the people in corporate environments are so over-taxed and over-stimulated and have a lot of obligations and responsibilities			0
' that hour , she explained , allows people the ' space to connect and do what they need to do , and what 's healthy for them			0
' and she 's keeping her yoga classes cell - phone free .			1
