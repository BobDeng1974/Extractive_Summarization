by @entity1 @entity0 how do you celebrate if you 've just become the oldest person ever to swim across the @entity4 ? if you 're @entity5 from @entity6 you crack open a couple of coldies			1
the 70 - year - old @entity1 on wednesday wrote his name into the record books by becoming the oldest person to swim from @entity11 in @entity12 to @entity13 in @entity14			1
' i 'm having a couple of beers for medicinal purposes only , to make myself sleep , ' @entity5 told @entity19 after completing the 34km feat in 12 hours and 45 minutes			1
the beer tasted a lot better than the large quantities of sea water he swallowed during the choppy crossing which left him feeling ' pretty crook '			0
@entity5 's spirits are still high at the halfway mark the 70 - year - old @entity1 on wednesday wrote his name into the record books by becoming the oldest person to swim from @entity11 in @entity12 to @entity13 in @entity14 @entity5 , aged 70 years and nine months , has replaced @entity12 @entity32 in the record books			1
@entity34 was five months younger when , in 2011 , he took almost 18 hours to cross the @entity4			0
while the @entity1 's time was much quicker there was a period towards the end when @entity5 was n't sure he would reach the @entity14 coastline			1
' around the 10 - hour mark i had a bad half - hour and was starting to worry a bit , ' he said after returning to @entity11 on the boat that had earlier escorted him to @entity13			1
' the arms were really sore , and i did n't seem to be making much ground , but i kicked on again			0
' @entity5 knew how tough the swim would be having previously crossed the @entity4 in 1985 as a 41 - year - old			1
back then the feat took him 10 hours and 44 minutes			2
the strict rules of long - distance swimming meant @entity5 was n't wearing a wetsuit on wednesday but rather regular speedos , a single swimming cap and goggles			2
there was no shark cage either			0
the @entity6 local has the record for now but it could be short - lived with @entity60 woman @entity59 , 73 , also planning an attempt this week			0
@entity5 , impressively , will be cheering her on			2
' the great part of it is , if she did it , @entity1 would then have the oldest man and the oldest woman , ' he said			0
' i 'll have held the oldest person for some time - that was the goal and that 's done - so i really hope she does ( succeed )			0
' @entity1 @entity72 holds the record for the fastest channel crossing having completed the marathon in six hours 55 minutes flat in 2012			1
if @entity59 makes it to @entity14 it 's unlikely @entity5 will try and reclaim the title in three or fours years ' time			1
' i 've hung my cap and goggles up as far as i 'm concerned , ' he said on wednesday			0
' you ca n't go on forever doing that sort of thing - i 'm nearly 71			0
' @entity5 was fulfilling a decades - old promise to his former coach @entity85 by completing the crossing			2
he was also raising money for cancer research via everydayhero.com.au / event / cyrilsswim .			0

@entity5 swam 34km from @entity11 in @entity12 to @entity13 in @entity14
it took the 70 - year - old @entity1 12 hours and 45 minutes
