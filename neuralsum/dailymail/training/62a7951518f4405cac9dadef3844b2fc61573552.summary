by @entity0 and @entity1 the biological family of a little girl taken from her foster parents and returned to her jailbird father have branded her adoptive mom and dad , ‘ selfish ’ for fighting to get her back and vowed never to give her up again			1
@entity8 , aged nine , had been in the care of @entity10 and @entity11 , from @entity12 , @entity13 for more than seven years , but she was recently handed over to ex-con @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the @entity11 family have released a heart - breaking phone conversation , revealing @entity8 ’s desperate pleas , begging to be reunited with them			1
but a female relative of @entity14 – a convicted felon who served time for transporting firearms – has hit back at the @entity41 , branding them " selfish " and accusing them of not have the little girl ’s best interests at heart			2
speaking from @entity15 , @entity16 , the woman , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ this is not the way to do things			1
if you do n’t get what you want you should n’t behave like they are			2
‘ they are spreading all kinds of dirt about @entity14 , but they do n’t know him			2
@entity8 should never have been with them in the first place			1
she was n’t treated badly			2
she ’s the most important person in @entity14 ’s life			2
‘ his mother , @entity8 ’s grandmother , never gave up on her and has been fighting to get her back all this time			1
her real family love her			2
‘ what is happening now is not in the best interests of the child			2
they are foster parents , but they are plastering her picture all over the internet and selling t - shirts with her face on to pay for lawyers ’ fees			1
i have never seen that kind of behavior			2
tragedy : mrs @entity23 and her husband were just given three hours notice before their adoptive daughter was taken from their home in @entity12 , @entity13 and moved to @entity15 , @entity16 ‘ @entity14 has had to take @entity8 into hiding because he is being targeted by people			1
some people stole his trash and tried to steal his truck			0
‘ i feel sorry for the @entity11 ’s because they have a relationship with @entity8 and if it was up to us , they would continue to see her , but they are making that impossible , because they want to take her back permanently			1
‘ we are never going to let that happen			0
she is family and families do n’t just give up on each other			0
they have no blood link to her			0
they have no right to her and if you ask me , their lawyer needs to tell them to shut their mouths			0
’ the family member also revealed @entity14 has been in prison for an armed robbery as well as transporting a gun across state lines			2
but she defended him saying : ‘ @entity14 got into trouble when he was a kid , i ’m not going to deny that			0
‘ but the robbery was not his fault			0
he told some guys how to do a robbery , but he was n’t with them when they did it			0
‘ it was the same with the gun charge			0
he was running a security firm and he was n’t allowed to have a gun			0
a woman was in his car and she had one , but it was n’t in a holster , so as it was in her car , he was charged			0
‘ but he has served his time and has straightened up			0
he just wants to start a new life with his daughter			0
’ @entity14 was in court in @entity13 on friday after the @entity135 petitioned to have her returned to them on @entity8 ’s best interest			1
the family adopted her in 2008 , but a @entity13 appeals court overturned that after @entity14 was released from prison			0
in a recording of a phone call made on january 30 this year , a day after @entity8 was moved from @entity12 to @entity15 , she can be heard asking for her adoptive parents to take her back			1
' what did you say , baby doll ? ' mrs @entity23 can be heard asking in a recording of the phone call obtained by @entity148			0
' i want to you to come and get me ' , the young girl responds			0
during the phone call , the last time the @entity41 spoke to her , @entity8 also describes her biological father 's home as ' dirty , with mold and cigarettes everywhere , ' and although the man is ' nice ' to her , the home lacks clean water			1
convicted felon : @entity8 has no memory of her father @entity160 , left , but a court still ruled she should live with him the @entity135 say they were given just three hours ' notice before the young girl was taken from them			1
' @entity8 's crying her eyes out			1
screaming bloody murder , " please do n't let them do this , @entity36 , please , @entity35 , do n't let ' em take me , " , ' mr @entity11 told @entity148			1
' they took her bags , and that 's the last that i 've seen her , ' mrs @entity23 adds			0
@entity14 had been awarded custody of his infant daughter in 2004 after @entity8 's mother gave up her rights			1
however , she has been living with the @entity41 since 2006 and they were able to adopt @entity8 after @entity14 pleaded guilty to transporting firearms and was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison			1
this automatically terminated his parental rights as @entity13 state law does not allow anyone incarcerated for more than ten years to have rights to a child under the age of eight			0
but his sentence was shortened to just eight years and he was able to retain it upon his release from prison after claiming his parental rights were illegally terminated			0
in 2009 , @entity14 won an appeal claiming he did not voluntarily give up his rights and the court did not follow due process in the adoption proceedings			0
for the next five years , @entity8 continued to live with the @entity41 on their @entity13 farm as the two sides fought for custody			2
in january this year , a judge ruled that the nine - year - old should return to her biological father , and a few hours later , she had been taken from the @entity135			1
@entity202 spokesman @entity201 said earlier this year that while foster parents often come to love the children in their care , the law is clear , ' birth parents have the right to raise their children			1

@entity211 has been ' returned ' to an ex-con father she did not know
nine - year - old had been living with @entity10 and @entity11 since 2006
they were given two hours notice before she was removed from their care
she now lives with her father , jailed for transporting arms , in @entity16
@entity8 has been calling her adoptive parents , pleading to return home
