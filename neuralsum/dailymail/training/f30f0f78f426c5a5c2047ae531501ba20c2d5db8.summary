despite boasting world - class players @entity2 and @entity3 , @entity5 ’s average gate last season was 8,906 – fewer than @entity7 in @entity8			1
@entity2 , the leading scorer at this summer ’s @entity9 , has since escaped the empty spaces of the principality with a £ 65million move to @entity13			1
and if @entity3 has his way , he ’ll be next			1
despite the trappings of @entity5 – hot sunshine , low tax , you get the picture – he finds it soul - destroying to perform in front of meagre crowds , even when finishing runners - up in the @entity24 to @entity25			1
@entity26 up : @entity3 is seeking a move away from @entity5 as he grows tired of life in @entity29 in action : @entity3 returned from injury recently to face @entity32 in a pre-season game at the @entity34 embrace : the forward hugs fellow @entity37 @entity36 ahead of the game @entity39 are reported to be keen and with super-agent @entity40 directing operations and @entity42 still needing to fill the space vacated by @entity44 with a genuine a-lister , it could add up			1
certainly , @entity3 has the quality and goals to be a hit at @entity49			2
importantly , he also possesses the physical strength to succeed in the @entity51			0
for him , hearing a rendition of @entity52 from thousands of @entity54 will be a marked contrast to the wide gaps he encounters at the @entity58 until a year ago , @entity5 was best known for being the launchpad of @entity61 ’s career			1
the @entity29 even persuaded @entity62 to join him			0
last year , a new high - roller tried to recapture the magic			2
@entity66 billionaire @entity65 , owner of @entity5 , went on a huge spending spree and landed @entity2 and @entity68 from @entity69 for £ 60million			1
then he gazumped @entity70 and @entity71 to capture @entity3 for £ 50million after the @entity73 striker scored 32 goals in @entity75 for @entity76			1
but now the dream has turned sour for the 28 - year - old striker who is getting to the age now where trophies are more important than an already - healthy bank balance			1
moved on : his former @entity5 team - mate @entity2 signed for @entity13 this summer rubbing shoulders : and he is now training with the likes of @entity87 on a day - to - day basis @entity89 quiet over possible @entity13 move the @entity73 was devastated to miss the @entity9 with a knee injury and is in no mood to tread water in the @entity94 for another 12 months			1
now back in action , he is aware of the interest from @entity39 , who were possibly less upset about missing out on @entity99 because they knew @entity3 was an option			1
@entity70 have also been mentioned as a possible destination because of injury to @entity104 though the club have done nothing to encourage the link			0
former @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity111 striker @entity110 , who won a @entity94 championship under @entity61 , says working and living in @entity5 is a surreal experience for a footballer			2
‘ in @entity109 , it was very intense , i could n’t go shopping or to a restaurant without getting mobbed			0
@entity5 was a different way of life , you could go for a stroll without anything , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity125 lived next door			0
@entity127 was in the same apartment block			0
we got friendly with the royal family , and all the sportsmen would go out to lunch			0
the motor racing drivers wanted to be footballers and vice-versa ! ’ frustrated : @entity3 was desperately upset to miss the @entity9 with @entity136 through injury finisher : but he showed he still has an eye for goal with his finish against @entity32 on sunday it all sounds idyllic in one sense but it has n’t given @entity3 enough professional pride			2
with debate about the @entity5 tax laws and the importance of financial fair play , even the compensation of the sky - high salaries may soon be a thing of the past			1
@entity3 is a late developer which may help @entity39 who usually buy young			1
he was 23 when he left @entity37 for @entity156 and started in @entity157			0
he was in his mid-twenties before he played in one of the top leagues , for @entity76			0
waiting for his chance did n’t harm @entity3			2
he scored 52 goals in three seasons for @entity76 and helped them win the @entity165 and @entity166 in successive seasons			0
last summer , every big club owner in @entity156 wanted him , including @entity169 and @entity170			0
on that occasion , he chose the trappings of @entity5			0
this time round , with his pal @entity2 gone and strike partner @entity174 not known for doing his share of the workload , he ’s tempted by the passion of the @entity178			0
