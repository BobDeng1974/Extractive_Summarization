this is the moment a driver deliberately blocked a sneaky motorist who tried to beat a traffic jam with an undertaking manoeuvre			1
@entity5 had started to build up on the @entity6 around @entity7 on @entity8 , with one motorist filming the gridlock on a dashcam			2
but one driver in a silver @entity13 obviously was n't prepared to wait in the queuing traffic on the outside lane , where vehicles were merging			1
traffic began to build up on the @entity6 around @entity7 in @entity8 when a silver @entity13 attempted to undertake the trafffic but a @entity20 driver was n't happy and pulled into the inside lane to block the @entity13 from moving forwards he attempted to sail up the inside lane in a sneaky bid to avoid having to wait			1
but to his shock , a silver @entity20 then pulls into the inside lane to block the @entity13 from advancing any further			0
not content with having to wait , the @entity13 driver the tries to both overtake and undertake the @entity20 in an attempt to get past the vehicle			1
the two cars then swerve around the lane as the @entity20 stays determined in not letting the @entity13 past the @entity13 , behind , is then forced to wait like the rest of the drivers , for 10 minutes as they approach an roundabout but each time he tries , the @entity20 swerves in the lane blocking the @entity13 from passing			2
the swerving goes back and forwards for over a minute before both drivers wind down their windows to confront each other			0
the pair can be seen pointing and shouting at each other but despite their argument , neither driver lets up			0
eventually the @entity13 driver catches up to the @entity20 with the man shouting and pointing at the @entity20 driver this then forces the @entity13 to wait 10 minutes in the queue like everybody else before moving back into the correct lane as they approach a roundabout			2
the incident was captured on a dashcam by a passing motorist and posted to @entity56 by a user called @entity58			0
