a @entity1 senator warned on thursday that @entity2 , the militant terror group sweeping across @entity3 , aims to destroy an @entity1 population center and is working on a plan to do it			1
' they 're crazy out there and they 're rapidly developing a method of blowing up a major @entity1 city and people just ca n't believe that 's happening , ' @entity6 sen. @entity6 told the @entity15 - 25 television in @entity16			1
@entity6 , the ranking @entity17 member of the @entity18 , warned that leaders of @entity2 ' are really bad terrorists			1
they 're so bad even @entity20 is afraid of them			1
' rep. @entity21 , a fellow @entity16 @entity17 and a committee member , told the @entity23 that @entity24 are ' cutting children 's bodies in half			1
i 've never seen anything like it			2
@entity2 is ' as sophisticated and well - funded as any group that we have seen , ' @entity52 said , appearing alongside @entity55 gen. @entity56			1
' they 're beyond just a terrorist group , ' @entity52 said			1
' they marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess			0
they are tremendously well funded			0
... this is beyond anything we 've seen , so we must prepare for everything			2
' ' it 's a long - term threat , ' he conceded under questioning from reporters , adding moments later that ' the president has been very clear on mission creep			1
and he 's made it very clear that he will not allow that			2
' gen. @entity56 warned that @entity1 's involvement in @entity3 will continue for years to come , citing the intensity of hatred among ethnic , religious and tribal groups there			2
' the conflict against those groups – most of which are local , some of which are regional , and some of which are global in nature – that 's going to be a very long contest , ' he said			2
rep. @entity21 said if @entity1 is going to do battle with @entity2 , ' we have to win ' ' it 's ideological			2
it 's religious in many cases			2
so , yes , it 's going to be a very long contest			2
' @entity21 said hours later that ' if we 're going to do these kinds of operations , we have to win			0
' but a frustrated @entity6 said thursday night that he fears president @entity37 is n't up to the task , despite the tough words he delivered wednesday before hitting the golf course			1
' @entity37 's lofty rhetoric is undermined by fainthearted follow - through and lack of meaningful action , ' he told the @entity23			1
' the president 's limited strikes in @entity3 have not halted @entity2 ' momentum but only temporarily redirected it , ' said @entity6			1
' without sustained pressure , @entity2 will regroup and continue its campaign of terror			0
' ' we 're in the most dangerous position we 've ever been in as a nation , ' he told @entity15 - 25			1
a top @entity120 general agreed on wednesday , writing on the @entity122 website that if the @entity1 military does n't ' eradicate ' @entity2 now more attacks on the @entity124 will come			0
general @entity126 praised @entity37 for the ordering airstrikes on @entity2 camps in northern @entity3 , but he urged him to ' move quickly to pressure the organisations entire " nervous system , " break it up , and destroy its pieces			1
' ' the @entity1 is now firmly in the game and remains the only nation on the planet capable of exerting the kind of strategic leadership , influence and strike capacity to deal with @entity139 [ @entity139 ] , ' he wrote			0
' it is also the only power capable of organizing a coalition 's reaction to this regional and international threat			0
' ‘ this group , ' he wrote , ' is not a flash in the pan that will go away of its own accord or if we do n’t poke at it			0
' general @entity126 praised @entity37 for recent airstrikes , but urged him to ' move quickly to pressure the organisations entire " nervous system " ' @entity126 also denied that the @entity1 military was war weary , saying it 's fully capable of attacking and reducing @entity2			1
‘ we should do it now , but supported substantially by our traditional allies and partners , especially by those in the region who have the most to give – and the most to lose – if the @entity165 ’s march continues			0
' ‘ if we delay now , we will pay later			0
' the president told a global audience this week from his @entity169 vacation spot that the @entity1 ' will continue to do what we must do to protect our people			0
' ' we will be vigilant and we will be relentless			0
when people harm @entity1 , anywhere , we do what 's necessary to see that justice is done			0
' ' we act against @entity2 , standing alongside others , ' @entity37 added , hinting at his ' coalition ' strategy rather than a plan to strike unilaterally with overwhelming @entity1 force			1
@entity6 , though , warned that without a concrete plan , @entity37 's words ring hollow			1
' relentless ' : @entity37 drew fire this week for golfing as an angry nation mourned the death of journalist @entity43 at the hands of an @entity2 militant the video , uploaded to jihadi websites on tuesday , shows the beginning of @entity43 's decapitation – and then his severed head resting on top of his prone body ' you have to come up with something that we 're going to do , ' the senator said , ' because they 're holding another hostage in place			1
' ' and the problem is , the president , quite frankly – he says all these things and he never does them			0
' with the right strategy , he added , the @entity1 could defeat @entity2 on its home turf before the threat arrives on @entity1 's doorstep			0
' this idea that they 're coming and infiltrating the @entity1 – sure , some are coming in who have had an association with @entity2			0
but the majority of them are still over there , ' he said			0
the senator also defended the @entity1 government 's sweeping intelligence programs that have drawn barbs from civil libertarians , suggesting that information dragnets would play a part in keeping @entity2 at bay			2
' you have to have an intelligence process going on to stop attacks on @entity1 , ' he said .			0

@entity16 senator said @entity37 needs a plan to crush the terror group
' they 're so bad even @entity20 is afraid of them , ' @entity6 said
another member of @entity238 said ' they 're cutting children 's bodies in half . they 're shooting them . i 've never seen anything like it '
@entity37 draws a *series* of red - lines and ' says all these things and he never does them , ' @entity6 *claimed*
his policy shows a ' fainthearted follow - through and lack of meaningful action '
