last year was the safest in the history of commercial aviation despite the loss of two high - profile @entity4 flights in which hundreds of people were killed , according to industry experts			1
while more people died in air accidents in 2014 than the average in recent years , the number of fatal accidents compared with the total number of flights was a record low , the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) said			0
the organisations said in a new report that there were 12 fatal accidents in 2014 with 641 fatalities , versus 19 fatal accidents and 517 fatalities per year in the five - year period between 2009 and 2013			1
the downing of @entity24 , in which 298 people died , was not included in the safety report because it was not technically classed as an accident @entity4 flight @entity24 takes off from schipol airport near @entity30 prior to being shot down as it flew over @entity31 ' while aviation safety was in the headlines in 2014 , the data show that flying continues to improve its safety performance , ' said @entity37 , @entity8 's director general and chief executive officer			1
the statistics translate into an accident rate , measured in ' hull losses ' per 1 million flights , of 0.23 , or the equivalent of one for every 4.4 million flights			2
@entity8 's 2014 statistics did not include the loss of @entity47 , which was shot down by a surface - to - air anti-aircraft missile in @entity31 last june and so not classified as an accident			2
all 298 people on board were killed			2
' to the flying public an air tragedy is an air tragedy , regardless of how it is classified , ' said @entity37			0
' in 2014 we saw a reduction in the number of fatal accidents - and that would be true even if we were to include @entity24 in the total			1
' the other high - profile event of 2014 , the disappearance of @entity63 on a flight from @entity65 to @entity66 on march 8 , 2014 , with 239 passengers and crew , has become one of the biggest mysteries in the history of aviation			1
an extensive search in the southern @entity74 , where satellite data showed that the @entity76 ended up after being diverted from its original flight path , has not found any sign of the plane			2
an investigation report that was released on sunday did not reveal anything new			2
@entity84 deputy prime minister @entity83 shows a new search area in the @entity74 where rescue crews are continuing to look for any signs of @entity63 's whereabouts an @entity84 defence vessel sails through the @entity74 as no trace has yet been found of the missing aircraft @entity93 aircrewman @entity92 searches from above for any signs of the missing @entity4 plane the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) , a @entity98 body that regulates global aviation , proposed after @entity63 that commercial aircraft report their position every 15 minutes instead of the current norm of 30 - 40 minutes			1
@entity37 told reporters at a briefing in @entity105 that such a system would be in place by november 2016			0
' at the moment there 's no technology that can track aircraft everywhere in the world over time , ' he said			0
' these things do n't happen overnight			0
' new space - based technologies might make real - time tracking possible soon , he added			0
' the promise is to be able to identify aircraft wherever they are in the world pretty much in real - time with no gaps in coverage , ' he said			0
' it may well be that this is the way we should go , however that technology wo n't be available for two or three years to come			0
' three of last year 's 12 plane crashes involved jet aircraft and accounted for the bulk of the deaths			0
in december , an @entity133 jet carrying 162 people crashed into the @entity135			1
in july , an @entity137 jet went down in @entity138 during bad weather , killing all 116 aboard			0
the nine other crashes involved turboprop aircraft , including a @entity142 that crashed in july on the @entity144 island chain in the @entity145 , killing 58 people			1
another @entity142 turboprop crashed in february this year , killing more than 40 people			1
the wreckage of @entity150 is removed from a rescue vessel in @entity152 , @entity153			0
the plane crashed into the @entity135 on december 28 , killing all 162 on board the @entity133 crash was one of three major incidents to rock the aviation industry last year			1

last year was the safest in history of commercial aviation , report claims
this was despite disappearance of @entity63 and shooting down of @entity24
but @entity24 death toll not included in report because it was not an accident
an @entity133 flight also crashed into the @entity135 , killing all 162 on board
