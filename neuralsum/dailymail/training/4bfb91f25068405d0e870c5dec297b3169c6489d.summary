@entity0 slumped to a three - year low in the @entity2 after they experienced another west country horror show just two weeks after being blitzed 45 - 0 by @entity4			1
@entity5 were the beneficiaries of another dreadful @entity0 display , cutting loose to claim a 33 - 16 victory that was based on first - half tries by @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
it was the first time since october 2011 for @entity0 to suffer three successive @entity2 defeats - they were beaten at home by @entity17 seven days ago - and they look to be nowhere near halting an alarming early - season slump			1
@entity5 's @entity20 ( centre ) gets past @entity0 's @entity22 and leaves him on the floor @entity25 international @entity24 kicked 18 points from four penalties and three conversions , while @entity0 could only muster an @entity22 penalty hat - trick and his conversion of an injury - time @entity31 try after @entity0 were out - thought and outplayed			2
@entity5 were sharper in attack , more physical up - front and much cleverer through their support work , which combined to leave @entity0 boss @entity36 assessing major problems ahead of hosting @entity38 next friday , which is followed by a @entity41 opener against @entity42			2
not even edging the second - half scoreline 7 - 3 will have lifted @entity0 ' spirits , as it did nothing to paper over alarming cracks			0
@entity5 showed three changes from the side that beat @entity50 last time out , with @entity24 , @entity10 and lock @entity51 all featuring , but injury - hit @entity0 were forced into a late change			1
already without @entity57 quintet @entity55 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , centre @entity53 was ruled out due to calf muscle trouble , so former @entity5 fly - half @entity63 - who was initially named on the bench - started , and @entity22 moved from 10 to 12			0
@entity25 international @entity24 kicked 18 points from four penalties and three conversions @entity22 and @entity24 exchanged early penalties before @entity24 's second successful strike nudged @entity5 6 - 3 ahead after the home side went close to a try , but were denied by @entity0 wing @entity72 's ankle - tap tackle on full - back @entity20			2
referee @entity75 continued to award penalties at frequent intervals , and @entity24 completed his hat - trick after just 12 minutes before @entity22 narrowed the gap to 9 - 6 , but @entity5 quickly tightened their grip			0
@entity63 , who had been given a vociferous homecoming by the @entity5 supporters , gave the home crowd more ammunition when he saw an attempted defensive clearance charged down by @entity51 , who then gathered the bounce and fed a supporting @entity10 for @entity5 's opening try			2
@entity24 converted as @entity5 opened up a 10 - point lead and alarm bells started ringing throughout a @entity0 team depleted by another injury blow when full - back @entity92 groggily left the action to be replaced by @entity95 , and @entity96 switched from wing to @entity0 ' last line of defence			0
@entity5 did not escape on the injury front , though , as their captain and @entity57 centre @entity101 departed after suffering what appeared to be a knock to his leg			0
things then continued to unravel for @entity0 as they found themselves horribly exposed in defence when @entity11 was freed in space , and the @entity57 wing effortlessly went around @entity110 before cutting inside @entity96 for a superb solo try that @entity24 converted			0
@entity0 , not for the first time this season , looked in a state of disarray , and although @entity22 kicked a third penalty just before half - time , @entity5 delivered a third try that owed everything to slick midfield passing			1
@entity0 @entity120 ( left ) hands off @entity5 's @entity122 fly - half @entity123 , watched from the stands by @entity127 head coach @entity126 and assistant @entity128 , set the score up by drawing his marker superbly , before @entity20 gave a scoring pass to may and @entity0 were again unlocked			1
@entity24 's successful touchline conversion rubbed salt into a gaping @entity0 wound , and at 30 - 9 down @entity0 faced a herculean second - half task to avoid fresh humiliation two weeks after they were thumped by @entity4			0
@entity0 showed a greater appetite for the battle during the third quarter , yet they could not break down @entity5 's defence , and after the home side absorbed a spell of pressure , @entity24 's fourth penalty took his team 24 points clear following a superb @entity123 break			0
@entity110 then received a yellow card for a shoulder charge on @entity11 , although referee @entity75 missed a dangerous tackle by @entity72 in the same phase of play , and @entity5 looked to ram home their superiority with a temporary one - man advantage by establishing a firm foothold deep inside @entity0 territory			1
they missed a golden opportunity when replacement scrum - half @entity159 got in @entity11 ' way with the @entity0 line beckoning , but the @entity0 had long since been beaten and @entity5 could celebrate their best performance of the season , despite seeing @entity31 scamper over during the dying seconds .			1

@entity5 benefit from terrible @entity0 display in *dominant* win
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 may all score first half tries
three years since @entity0 last suffered three *straight* @entity2 defeats
