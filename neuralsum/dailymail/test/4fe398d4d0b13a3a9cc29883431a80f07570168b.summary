the @entity1 ’ saga took a new twist on friday when it emerged the @entity4 judicial panel had decided it was not entitled to apply retrospective punishment in his case			1
on thursday , the @entity9 defender was cleared to play in the @entity10 against @entity11 on may 30 after a charge of deliberate handball to deny @entity15 striker @entity14 in last sunday ’s semi-final was thrown out			1
in the aftermath of the 3 - 2 extra-time win , @entity1 admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been red - carded			1
@entity9 defender @entity1 will be allowed to appear in @entity10 final after his ban was dismissed his admission – backed by manager @entity23 – preceded the player being cited by the @entity4 compliance officer @entity25			1
that unprecedented move following a game in which a handball incident had gone unpunished , brought a warning from @entity30 , head of @entity32 ’s referees committee , that a successful prosecution would open up a can of worms			0
although such a scenario was avoided with the charge being kicked out , the furore surrounding the issue prompted the @entity4 go public on friday with the tribunal panel ’s reasons			0
and it seems they accepted the preliminary argument of @entity9 ’ legal representative that they were n’t entitled to take the matter further			2
a statement read : ‘ further to the judicial panel hearing on friday involving @entity1 , the panel considered initial submissions from mr @entity1 ’ solicitor			2
‘ in particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter			0
@entity1 was not sent off and no penalty was given as @entity9 went on to beat @entity15 3 - 2 after extra-time ‘ the panel considered that as the incident ( but not the actual alleged sending - off offence of handball ) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further			1
‘ it accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident or the decision arrived at by the referee			0
’ the explanation raises questions as to whether @entity25 ought to have cited @entity1 in the first place			2
@entity1 admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been red - carded against @entity15 however , legal sources have told @entity77 that the @entity4 ’s prosecutor is entitled to cite players even in such instances when officials have seen an ‘ incident ’ but have failed to spot an ‘ offence ’			1
yet it appears that in @entity1 ’ case , the panel concurred with his solicitor ’s argument that they were not entitled to take the matter further as the match officials had seen the incident			0
the matter is further confused by the fact that former @entity95 striker @entity94 and @entity97 keeper @entity96 were previously banned retrospectively for serious foul play as the referees in question had seen the ‘ incidents ’ but missed the ‘ offences ’ in question .			0
