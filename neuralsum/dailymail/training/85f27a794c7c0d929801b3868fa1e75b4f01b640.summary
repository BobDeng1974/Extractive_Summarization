poster issued by @entity7 on drought conditions			1
it announced a hosepipe ban in march @entity49 , @entity50 spokesman , said : ‘ customers will find this bonus bonanza hard to swallow			0
@entity7 just does n’t understand the pressures facing customers during this recession			1
’ and the @entity58 water workers ’ union described the pay - out as an ‘ outrage ’			0
@entity61 , @entity58 national officer , said : ‘ this is a classic case of reward for failure			0
this money came from the hard - earned income of hard - pressed householders			0
’ he said the current hosepipe ban was evidence of a long - term failure of management at @entity7 , which stands accused of doing too little to capture the rainwater that falls in the region			1
the company has sold off a number of small reservoirs in recent years , often for housing , with the sales helping the company to pay £ 5billion in dividends to shareholders since privatisation in 1989			2
currently , these shareholders are made up of a consortium led by the @entity86 investment bank @entity85 plus branches of the governments of @entity89 and @entity90			0
@entity27 has managed to meet leakage - reduction targets in recent years , but the firm still loses around a quarter of the 2.6billion litres of the treated tap water that it supplies each day			0
just last week , a large section of the @entity96 was flooded after contractors broke a 24in mains pipe as they tried to fix a leak , leaving 300 passengers stranded below ground			0
the failure was said to have left mayor of london @entity103 seething amid fears that a repeat could severely hit visitors to the @entity108			0

the company said the drought was ' entirely to do with the weather ' mr @entity6 , 47 , has spent most of his working life in the water industry since studying for a civil engineering degree at @entity118 in the 1980s			1
apart from his salary and annual bonus , the father of two also receives an annual housing allowance of £ 36,000 to pay for accommodation during the week close to the company ’s head office in @entity126			1
mr @entity6 , whose family home is in @entity128 , also gets a £ 15,000 car allowance and £ 2,300 for other unspecified expenses			1
@entity7 insisted that the rewards for top executives are based on performance and match those of companies of a similar size			1
it said : ‘ bonuses are only awarded if we hit our operational and regulatory targets			2
for example , the leakage - reduction goal was hit six years in a row , 100 per cent compliance maintained at all our sewage works , best tap water quality of all the major suppliers			0
‘ if these targets are missed then bonuses are not awarded			2
’ @entity7 reported a 13 per cent drop in underlying pre-tax profits to £ 182.2million , which was driven by higher bad debts and higher interest costs			1
the company has pledged to spend nearly £ 5billion in the five years to 2015 , which includes water and sewer pipe replacements			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ it may not seem like it , but before this year ’s very wet spring we had had the driest two - year period on record in our region			1
‘ this meant we had to impose a temporary use ban , or ‘ hosepipe ’ ban , to make sure we would have enough water to go round , whatever the weather			0
‘ after many weeks of unusually wet and miserable weather the situation is now a lot less serious and we expect to be able to lift the hosepipe ban sooner rather than later			0
’ industry sources believe the ban will be lifted completely across the @entity7 and @entity176 areas , where reservoirs are 90 - 100 per cent full			2
@entity178 and four other smaller firms in the @entity180 are expected to end the ban in some – but not all – areas .			0
