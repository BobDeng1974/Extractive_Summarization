by @entity0 published : 18:26 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 09:22 est , 6 august 2013 more than a quarter of home buyers are now paying stamp duty at the higher rates of 3 per cent or more , research has found			1
hundreds of thousands of first - time buyers and hardworking families are losing out to the tune of more than £ 7,500 when they move home , the @entity13 ’ @entity7 study found			1
the pressure group launched a @entity16 campaign calling for a cut in the ‘ punitive ’ levy , which raised £ 4billion for the @entity19 in 2012/13 - some £ 3.6billion of which was collected at rates of 3 per cent or more			1
sales of residential properties are free of stamp duty up to the value of £ 125,000 and attract a 1 per cent tax between £ 125,000 and £ 250,000			1
but rising house prices mean that more and more purchasers are paying at the higher rates of 3 per cent applied to homes worth between £ 250,000 and £ 500,000			1
a rate of 4 per cent is charged on those valued at up to £ 1million , 5 per cent on those between £ 1 - £ 2million and 7 per cent beyond that point			1
@entity46 , chief executive of the @entity13 ’ @entity7 , said : ‘ owning your own home is an important milestone , but for many families it seems harder and harder to reach			1
sales of residential properties are free of stamp duty up to the value of £ 125,000 and attract a 1 per cent tax between £ 125,000 and £ 250,000 ‘ ministers have done nothing to ease the burden imposed by stamp duty , which is an unfair double tax that gets in the way of would - be first - time buyers and others thinking about moving			1
instead they have made things worse with new thresholds and new , higher rates			2
‘ the government needs to act on ministers ’ rhetoric about getting people onto the property ladder and cut this unfair tax			1
’ the @entity13 ’ @entity7 research found that , unsurprisingly , home - buyers in @entity71 and the @entity72 are hardest hit			1
but an increasing number of people in other parts of the country are being hit by stamp duty at the 3 per cent rate			2
the group argues that stamp duty acts as a barrier both for an increasing number of first - time buyers and existing home - owners wanting to move house to get a new job , be near to relatives or accommodate a growing family			1
because stamp duty is imposed on the total value of the property , and not just the portion of the price which is above the threshold , families buying a home for between £ 250,000 and £ 500,000 pay between £ 7,500 and £ 15,000			1
tax bills : the average house price has sat above the 1 per cent stamp duty threshold for a decade , @entity98 's chart shows , but many properties incur a much higher 3 per cent charge			2
in @entity104 and @entity105 , some 723,829 homes were bought in 2012/13 , with more than 25 per cent ( 182,692 ) being liable for stamp duty at a rate of 3 per cent or more			1
stamp duty rates of 3 per cent or more were imposed on 65 per cent of all residential transactions in @entity71 , and 39 per cent in the rest of the @entity72			1
the figure was 27 per cent in the @entity112 , 24 per cent in the @entity113 , 12 per cent in the @entity114 and 10 per cent in the @entity115 , according to the @entity7 research			2
in the north , the figures were much lower : 9 per cent in the @entity119 , @entity120 and the @entity121 , and 6 per cent in the @entity122			2
some 8 per cent of @entity105 homes attracted the higher levies			0
the @entity7 did not look at @entity125			0
the recent 2020 @entity127 review by the @entity7 and the @entity128 concluded that stamp duty should be abolished , as did the @entity130 from the @entity131			0
@entity132 : stamp duty is an unfair tax that needs changing perhaps the most infuriating thing about the unfair stamp duty system is that today 's buyers of an ordinary family home get stung with a tax bill originally designed for the wealthiest , writes this is @entity139 editor @entity132			0
that £ 250,000 threshold that hits ordinary families so hard has never gone up , despite rampant house price inflation since 1997 , when then chancellor @entity143 introduced extra levels of the tax			0
if it had been linked to property prices it would now stand at £ 716,000 , according to @entity98 's data			0
as a point of comparison , today 's £ 250,000 home would have cost you £ 87,000 in 1997 - a level that would currently incur no stamp duty whatsoever			2
buyers pay the tax on a property 's sale price , so those big bills they pay are ultimately driven by the seller 's profit			0
you can work out how much stamp duty you would pay using our calculator below			0
until @entity143 's arrival as chancellor in 1997 , stamp duty was a flat rate of 1 % above £ 60,000			0
he first changed this to 1.5 % above £ 250,000 and 2 % above £ 500,000 and then cashed in on his property boom by hiking these to 3 % and 4 % , respectively , in 2000			2
the effect as house prices rocketed through the 2000s boom was a nice little earner as the tax dragged more and more families into a trap originally laid for the wealthy			0
since then new stamp duty thresholds have also been added at £ 1m and £ 2m and @entity179 has given no indication that he will change the slab system , despite repeated calls to do so			0
this is @entity139 has long campaigned against the unfair nature of stamp duty and called for a serious investigation into its change and welcomes the @entity16 campaign			1
it is a bad tax , it is levelled unfairly , hits some regions far worse than others , encourages extra debt and inhibits people moving for work			0
while a change to stamp duty would cut tax revenue , it would at least make the system fairer			0
it would also prevent the current situation that involves buyers loading themselves up with bigger mortgages as they need to use cash that could have gone into their deposit to pay a hefty tax bill			0
from midnight on 21 march , @entity210 2012 , a new tax tier was introduced on homes costing more than £ 2,000,000			0
these homes now attract a rate of 7 % .			0

@entity16 campaign is calling for a cut in the ‘ punitive ’ levy ,
