by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 last night called on @entity3 to ‘ immediately ’ say what cuts @entity5 would make to keep within a legal cap on welfare set by the government			1
the @entity9 said the @entity11 ’s decision to back the new long - term limit was a ‘ scam ’ unless he was prepared to say how he would fund the scrapping of the so - called bedroom tax			1
a group of 13 @entity17 , including former frontbenchers @entity18 and @entity20 , rebelled against their party ’s backing for the government ’s plan			2
demand : @entity2 ( left ) has called on @entity3 ( right ) to ' immediately ' say what cuts @entity5 would make to keep within a legal cap on welfare set by the government but the measure , which means overall welfare spending can not rise above inflation from a fixed limit of £ 119.5billion until 2020 , passed easily in the @entity33 , by 520 votes to 22			1
a radical new limit – to be set every five years , and taking effect next year – will include housing benefit , tax credits , disability benefits and pensioner benefits , although the state pension and jobseekers ’ allowance will be excluded			1
governments will have to respond to any breach of the cap by cutting welfare in what chancellor @entity48 describes as a ‘ limit on the nation ’s credit card ’			2
under the legislation , any increase on one part of the welfare budget will have to be offset with cuts elsewhere			0
a @entity33 vote will have to be held if the cap is breached and the government does not want to respond by cutting spending			0
pledge : @entity5 has already pledged to reverse cuts in housing benefit for council tenants with spare rooms - dubbed the ' bedroom tax ' by critics an incoming @entity5 government will be free to set a higher cap at the start of the next parliament , but would have to change the law if it wanted to unpick the system altogether			1
@entity5 has already pledged to reverse cuts in housing benefit for council tenants with spare rooms - dubbed the ‘ bedroom tax ’ by critics			1
mr @entity2 said reversing the housing benefit cuts would mean @entity5 would immediately breach the cap as it would cost £ 460million			2
‘ they have to say immediately now what would they actually reduce in that spending to be able to afford that otherwise they are voting to break the cap immediately , ’ the @entity9 said			2
‘ i think there ’s a bit of a scam going on			0
because what they are trying to persuade their own backbenchers is , “ do n’t worry , we wo n’t implement this as it stands ”			0
‘ they have to tell us whether they would make savings to cover getting rid of the spare room subsidy			0
’ @entity3 suffered a fresh blow yesterday when a poll showed that fewer than a fifth of voters think he is fit to be prime minister			0
a @entity100 survey said that just 19 per cent could imagine him in @entity101 and only 26 per cent of voters think @entity5 is ready for government .			0
