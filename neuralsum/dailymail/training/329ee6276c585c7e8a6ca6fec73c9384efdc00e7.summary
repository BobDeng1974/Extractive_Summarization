there was more than one occasion watching @entity3 ’s 2 - 2 draw against @entity4 on wednesday night when i had to blink twice and make sure it was @entity7 not @entity8 who was pulling the strings			1
not since @entity8 has an @entity3 midfield player performed with such panache , vision , skill and bare - faced cheek as @entity7 showed in @entity15			1
there were dribbles , step overs , nutmegs , probing passes and a goal threat – the sorts of things that not only take opponents out of the game and open them up but also make them fearful			0
running the show : the way @entity7 beat players against @entity4 was reminiscent of @entity8 in @entity29 ( below ) @entity30 had all those attributes and that is why he is still revered by a generation , especially for how he transformed @entity3 at the @entity29			1
but now at last there seems to be a genuine heir , in football terms at least			0
the manner in which @entity7 set up @entity38 for @entity3 ’s second goal in @entity15 was straight out of @entity30 ’s mercurial manual			1
the big question is will @entity42 have the balls to unleash @entity7 at @entity44 14 as @entity45 did @entity8 at @entity29 ? judging by @entity42 ’s comments in the wake of wednesday ’s game he is not ready to take the ‘ gamble ’			1
yet in many ways his reluctance echoed that of @entity45 ahead of @entity29 , so perhaps he is bluffing			0
@entity42 has described constant questions about @entity7 as an obsession			2
@entity45 felt the same way when the press corps kept banging on about @entity8			2
taking them on : @entity7 was willing to run at @entity4 in @entity15 and his positivity led to @entity3 's second goal bank on @entity7 : @entity42 has said it 'd be a ' gamble ' to play the @entity64 star but he must start of @entity7 ’s exciting display in @entity15 , @entity42 said : ‘ he lost the ball an awful lot of times as well			2
if he ’s going to be the player we want him to be he has to make better decisions of when he turns with the ball			0
’ it is what @entity45 kept saying about @entity30 in the build up to @entity29			2
indeed it should be remembered that @entity8 , 23 by the start of that tournament , was as much an international rookie as 20 - year - old @entity7 is now			1
@entity8 had played bit - parts in the qualifiers and it was only in a friendly match against @entity84 in late april that he pushed himself into the frame when he scored one and made three in a 4 - 2 win at @entity88			0
even then , @entity45 harboured doubts but when it came to the crunch he went with @entity30 ’s maverick style rather than the more ‘ reliable ’ @entity93 and @entity94			0
galvanising @entity30 : the @entity3 midfielder holds off @entity96 in the @entity29 semi-final @entity98 of class : @entity8 skips away from @entity100 and his penchant for the unexpected scared @entity102 @entity104 style : @entity8 jinks through the @entity107 defence during the @entity29 quarter - final after a dour opening draw against @entity110 , @entity3 came alive in another draw against @entity102 where @entity8 ’s lust for the game and penchant for the unexpected offered @entity3 a new dimension			1
for once a @entity98 team playing @entity3 looked scared of an opponent who could out play them			0
galvanised by @entity30 , @entity3 went on to produce some of their best football at a major tournament until losing to @entity121 on penalties in the semi-final			0
given the system @entity42 plays , there is actually more margin for ‘ error ’ by putting @entity7 in the team especially if he replaces the jaded and over-hyped @entity128			1
also @entity7 ’s personality is less erratic than @entity8 ’s , as is his discipline			1
decisions : @entity42 is facing the same quandary over @entity7 as @entity45 ( right ) did over @entity8 the game breakers - players who have the skill and bravery to take on opponents in the tightest positions - are liable to lose the ball as @entity7 did against @entity4			2
it sometimes even still happens to @entity141 and @entity142			0
but these are the players who raise teams to a different level and put a smile on the face of supporters			0
@entity8 did that for @entity3 in 1990 and @entity7 can do that this summer			1
so what if @entity3 ca n’t win the @entity29 ? @entity42 , as @entity45 did , should at least give it a try .			0

@entity7 is an international *novice* , as @entity8 was in 1990
@entity156 set up @entity158 goal was out of @entity30 manual
@entity7 could replace ' jaded ' and ' over-hyped ' @entity128
