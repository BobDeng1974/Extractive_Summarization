@entity0 will set out on his quest to join the pantheon of golf 's greatest - ever players in a fortnight 's time			1
the world no 1 will arrive at @entity8 hunting the elusive @entity9 he needs to complete a historic @entity10 of majors			1
only five players have achieved the incredible feat , post-war			1
but victory at the masters will elevate the @entity17 into the company of legends @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity0 hits the gym as he prepares for the masters at @entity8 next month the @entity17 has been pumping iron as he goes hunting for the elusive @entity9 @entity0 shows off the @entity29 trophy to fans back in @entity31 four years ago at times , @entity0 has made it look easy			1
for the past 73 weeks he has been the leading golfer on the planet , landing @entity35 and the @entity36 along the way			2
although the 25 - year - old still has a long way to go before surpassing @entity24 ' record of 683 total weeks as world no 1 , he is undoubtedly the @entity42 's successor as golf 's heavyweight star - both on and off the greens			1
and his obsession with the gym is giving the star more than a helping hand			2
' it was when i started to notice results that i fell in love with it , ' said @entity0 , who has offered a fascinating and unique insight into his preparation off the course in this new @entity59 training video , seen exclusively by @entity60			1
indeed , @entity0 has bulked up considerably over the past five years with his transformation evident in both stature and presence on the course			1
since 2010 he has worked closely with dr @entity65 , a @entity66 exercise physiologist who has previously masterminded the fitness programmes for @entity68 and the @entity70 's @entity69			2
when @entity0 first started with @entity65 he could barely stand 10 seconds balancing on one leg			1
now , with 14 wins and four majors to his name , he has the muscle strength to last on one leg throughout an entire golf swing			2
@entity0 is setting out on his quest to join the pantheon of golf 's greatest - ever players the 25 - year - old needs a @entity83 crown to complete a historic @entity10 of golfing majors @entity0 won the 143rd @entity35 at @entity85 in @entity86 in july last year ' i was n't really big into the gym , ' he admits			1
' so my physical training was pretty much non-existent from when i turned pro at 18 until i turned 21			2
' i had three years when i was playing professionally on the @entity91 , doing ok but not , i guess , maximising my potential by coming into the gym and doing the work that i needed to do			2
' i ended up having a few niggles here and there – a few little injuries which , had i let them go on longer , could have turned into serious issues that could have put me out for a while			2
' so it was definitely out of necessity that i started – for injury prevention more than anything else			0
then the more you get into , you find yourself wanting to get stronger			0
you want to see what your limits are and to test your body physically			0
i really started to get into it and it became part of my lifestyle			0
up to that point it had n't been – i 'd just played golf without really training much or watching what i ate			0
now , obviously , things are very different			0
@entity0 won by one stroke to clinch the 96th @entity36 at @entity119 in august last year ' it took me four years of training to get my body into the best possible shape for what i do , which ultimately is go out and play golf			1
i have no ambitions to try and squat 500 pounds like some guys do but i do enough and i 'm strong enough to control the golf club the whole way through my swing – that 's basically what i need to do			0
' for some people [ going to the gym ] it 's just looking in the mirror and feeling better about themselves , or tracking their numbers – lifting bigger , lifting heavier , being able to do more reps with more weight or whatever it is			0
' but for me it was being able to stand up , hit 50 drivers in a row and feel no pain in my back			0
that is what made me realise that training is something i need to do – i need to do this a lot , and if i want to prolong my career as much as i can , i need to keep doing it			0
' since 2010 he has worked closely with dr @entity65 , who masterminded @entity68 's fitness programme @entity65 devises programmes that stretch between six to eight weeks in order to get @entity0 in the best possible shape for major tournaments , with the focus on adding stability , strength and power			1
during tournament week , @entity65 attempts to control @entity0 's desire to post a workout			1
the superstar will train , on top of his practice range sessions , nearly every day bar the tournament - ending sunday			0
at last year 's @entity29 at @entity86 , @entity65 made @entity0 a deal that he could do a gym session if he shot a round of 67			1
' i 'll do my heavier sessions on monday and tuesday , maybe take a day off , and then do a couple of lighter ones over the course of the thursday , friday and saturday , ' said @entity0			1
' i 'll always give myself sunday off just as it 's the last day of the tournament – maybe i 'll go in if i feel like some sort of warm - up session , but nothing more			0
so two heavier sessions and two lighter sessions			0
' when @entity0 first started with @entity65 he could barely stand 10 seconds balancing on one leg @entity0 believes his preparation for @entity8 has been perfect and the man who finished runner - up to @entity190 king @entity189 at last year 's @entity192 contest is confident that he stands a good chance of triumphing in @entity194			1
' obviously it 's the first really big tournament of the year and it 's even bigger for me this time round for a few different reasons , ' he added			0
' i think i 've had a good build - up to it			0
' we try to put a lot of work into it at the start of the year , around january and february time , going through different phases of training			0
endurance at the start , and then more into a strength phase , before maybe tapering off a little bit in the lead up to the masters			2
' we still work hard the week before but then the week of the tournament we try to taper it down so that i know i 'm in great shape and i know i 'm ready			0
i 'll have done the volume , i 'll have done the workload and i 'll just be ready to go out and play			0
' @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 ... now is it time for @entity0 to become the next @entity66 champion of the masters ? indeed , the nation hopes the hard work will ultimately pay off			1
a grand slam and golf folklore awaits if @entity0 can finally lift the big one			1
