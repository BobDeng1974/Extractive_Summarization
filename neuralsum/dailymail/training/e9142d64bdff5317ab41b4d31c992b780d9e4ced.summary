@entity0 rolled back the years to inspire @entity1 to a richly deserved victory as the @entity3 made a mockery of their abject domestic form			1
the former @entity6 no 8 produced a magnificent display at the back of a resurgent @entity1 scrum alongside returning @entity11 captain @entity10 , scoring a vital second - half try while tackling himself almost to a standstill at a packed @entity14			1
@entity16 ’s men — lying ninth in the @entity18 — are now three points clear at the top of pool 2 in the @entity22 with three wins from three			2
‘ it ’s only half - time against @entity25 and half - time in this group , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s fantastic to win our home games but we ’ve been in this position before and we know we ’re going to face another war next week			2
if we could n’t get up for a game like this then we really should n’t be here			0
it ’s another moment in @entity1 history today			1
’ five - and - a - half years after the @entity54 scandal rocked the @entity56 club , this comprehensive victory over the same opponents should go a long way to finally closing that unwanted chapter in their history			1
the 47 - cap veteran has not played for @entity6 since the last @entity64 and it is stretching the bounds of probability to suggest he could feature in next year ’s tournament			0
but on this kind of form he is surely worthy of consideration			0
‘ i ’ve always said it , ’ @entity16 said when asked if @entity33 could feasibly play for @entity6 again			0
‘ @entity0 is an old head who can cover a few positions			1
@entity1 scrum half @entity73 makes a surge through a gap but is stopped by @entity28 and @entity77 ( left ) ‘ sometimes when you ’re in those kind of matches you need those old people around			1
we have a lot of youngsters who are learning on the hoof but when he plays like that he is a very special player			0
i ’m very fortunate i ’ve been around the club while he ’s been here			0
he ’s towards the tail end of his career but he ’s still got a few years left in him			0
@entity90 is still playing and he ’s 40 ! ’ @entity10 was not far behind his back - row partner as the @entity1 pack produced a sensationally high work - rate allied to a rock - solid scrummaging display which was light years away from last week ’s embarrassing @entity18 mauling at the hands of @entity97			1
@entity33 and @entity10 made 13 tackles apiece but @entity1 will point to an outstanding collective effort which suggests they have turned a corner following a disjointed start to the season			1
the win was built on a phenomenal scrummaging performance which saw @entity105 give his former team - mate @entity106 a torrid afternoon before being forced off late in the second half with a shoulder injury			2
@entity25 centre @entity109 fires over a penalty for the visitors but his six penalties would not be enough @entity0 said : ‘ the way the scrum is going this season it ’s a real battle and hard to predict , but we got on top today			1
that was really pleasing after last week			0
’ @entity16 remained confident that @entity105 , whom he described as ‘ battered ’ after four internationals in succession , will be fit for next saturday ’s return fixture at the @entity124 , although fly - half @entity125 is more doubtful after lasting only 13 minutes before being replaced by 21 - year - old new recruit @entity127			2
‘ i thought the players showed unbelievable desire today , ’ @entity16 added			0
‘ we just have to make sure we ’re ready for the @entity124			0
we have to be 20 or 30 per cent better than we were today			0
but the players are buzzing after that			0
‘ sometimes it ’s about grit and we showed that in abundance			0
’ @entity1 captain @entity10 hugs his team - mate @entity136 as his side clinched victory at the @entity14 @entity139 , brought in on a short - term contract to cover for the injured @entity141 , looked nervous at times but showed plenty of heart to kick three from five attempts			1
the sides were level at 9 - 9 at half - time but @entity0 ’s 53rd - minute try — taken superbly with his hands outstretched over his head — put @entity1 in front and they never looked back			1
@entity1 ’ @entity153 winger @entity32 intercepted @entity29 ’s attempted pass six minutes later and ran the length of the pitch to score			1
but despite two late penalties from the flawless @entity109 , @entity25 could not quite drag themselves back into contention			1
@entity25 head coach @entity159 said : ‘ it was disappointing			2
we did n’t control the set - piece or get any dominance			0
we have to get that right next week			0
’ an impish left - foot drop - goal from scrum - half @entity73 , who also produced a fine all - round display , sealed victory for @entity16 ’s men and set up a mouth - watering encounter in @entity36 next week			2
@entity0 ’s name will be the first on the team - sheet .			2

@entity0 touches down for *crucial* try in the second half
@entity1 winger @entity32 intercepted @entity29 **'s** stray pass to seal victory for @entity1
@entity109 kicked six penalties for @entity25
@entity183 **'s** side now lead pool two with three games remaining
