by @entity1 reporter published : 16:22 est , 21 september 2013 updated : 04:54 est , 22 september 2013 young women are often told about the pains associated with menstruation , but one 10 - year - old was in over her head when she complained about a pain early thursday morning			1
that 's because what her family deduced was her first period was actually a gunshot wound			2
the 10 - year - old was sleeping in her bed at her home in @entity16 , @entity17 around 2am thursday morning when shots fired outside hit her in the buttocks			1
the girl 's father , 42 , told @entity22 that he heard the shots , but thought they sounded like bulbs popping			2
her father , above , said they did n't know it was from a bullet soon after , his 10 - year - old daughter came out of her bedroom complaining about a pain in her pelvic region			1
he says the girl 's mother and sister examined her and believed the blood was from her starting her menstrual cycle			0
' an older sister gave her a pad and told her to put it on and go back to bed , ' @entity44 lt @entity43 told the @entity50			2
but when she woke up for school the next morning , she was still in pain			0
shots fired : the family lives in a neighborhood known for gang - activity , and her father says they do n't call police when they hear gunfire on the streets the damage : a car parked outside the home was hit by some of the bullets in the gunfire			1
police are still uncertain why the house was targeted that 's when her parents examined her more closely and noticed the wound on her buttocks			1
the girl 's 15 - year - old sister called 911 and emergency responders were dispatched around 7:30am			1
despite nursing a bullet wound for five hours , police say the girl was ' in good spirits ' when they arrived			1
she went into surgery friday to remove the bullet and was last reported recovering in the hospital			0
at first , police were suspicious as to why they were n't called sooner about the shots			0
' how come we were n't called ? we really need to know why we were n't called , ' hayward police sgt @entity88 told @entity22			0
' if they were scared - understandable			0
but we still need to be out there to treat whoever we can treat			0
' shot while sleeping : the girl was last reported recovering from surgery to remove the bullet the girl 's father explained that it is n't customary in the gang - ridden neighborhood to call the police every time gunshots are heard			1
' we do n't call the cops when you hear shots on the streets			0
i did n't know it was in front of my house and i did n't know my daughter was shot , ' he said			0
the doctor who examined the girl agreed that the parents could have mistaken the blood for a period since the entry wound was ' rather small '			2
' the doctor said that if that 's what they were seeing and they never initially saw the entry wound from behind , that it 's plausible to believe it was a period as opposed to being shot , ' said lt @entity43			2
after the evaluation , the police said they would no longer be pursuing child neglect charges			1
it 's still uncertain why the family was targeted , and so far police have not arrested any suspects in the shooting .			0
