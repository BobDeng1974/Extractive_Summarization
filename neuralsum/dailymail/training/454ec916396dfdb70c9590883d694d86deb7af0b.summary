by @entity0 sophisticated gangs of thieves prowling @entity5 's streets to steal dogs to order are identifying their victims - by daubing the letter ' k ' on their driveways , police revealed yesterday			2
lookouts are leaving the ' @entity12 in crayon or spray paint after finding valuable dogs worth stealing and selling in unwitting owners ' gardens in the @entity19 area , north of @entity20 , @entity21			1
the burglars then return later and take the animals in a online black market trade that is said to be earning criminal gangs hundreds of thousands of pounds			1
at risk : the online black market trade of dogs that have been stolen from gardens is said to be netting criminal gangs hundreds of thousands of pounds ( file picture ) the latest incidents of the ' @entity12 - believed to be a play on the word ' canine ' - were highlighted by @entity37 officers who are investigating thefts in @entity19			1
gangs are stealing either pedigree dogs to sell to unwitting buyers online or mutts they can use in illegal dog fights			1
pedigree dogs are sold on the black market for up to £ 2,000 each			1
experts say an estimated 3,500 thefts were reported in the @entity5 last year - an increase of around 17 per cent on the previous 12 months			2
now police are urging residents to watch out for the letter ' k ' daubed on driveways , people looking in gardens or asking questions about individual dog owners			1
cheshire police detective sergeant @entity56 said : ‘ we have seen these types of markings placed outside houses before			0
‘ however it would appear that certain groups have started again to use this method of identifying houses that are of interest to them			0
we have had several reports of people acting suspiciously and asking questions to dog owners			2
‘ our intelligence suggests they are targeting breeds of dogs like terriers that could be used for illegal dog fights , or for hunting			2
it is also possible they might sell rarer breeds on			2
’ @entity80 in @entity81 has taken in several dogs which had previously been stolen from their owners			1
co-ordinator @entity89 , 75 , said : ‘ it 's disgusting that people will go to these lengths to steal people 's pets			2
fortunately , because of micro-chipping , we can trace the owners but without it there 's not much chance of tracking a dog down once it 's been stolen			0
’ on location : lookouts are leaving the ' @entity12 in crayon or spray paint after finding valuable dogs worth stealing and selling in unwitting owners ' gardens in the @entity19 area ( pictured ) of @entity21 only last month a dog - breeder suffered one of the latest pedigree dog - napping crimes - after his four prized puppies were stolen			1
@entity109 , 37 , was in the process of selling three of the 10 - week - old @entity113 akitas , and keeping the fourth for himself , when raiders broke into his home			0
mr @entity109 , of @entity117 , @entity118 , has two adult akitas and this was the second litter he has reared , with each puppy worth about £ 450			0
on march 21 he had left all six dogs in his home while popping out when thieves forced open his rear patio door and ransacked his home - taking the puppies but leaving the adult dogs			1
mr @entity109 added : ‘ my advice to other dog owners would be to report any suspicious behaviour to the police and let your neighbours know if you see people hanging around and acting strangely			0
' it 's a horrible feeling to lose your dog			0
to be honest i do n't think i 'll ever see the puppies again ' @entity109 , 37 , of @entity117 , @entity118 ‘ it 's a horrible feeling to lose your dog			0
to be honest i do n't think i 'll ever see the puppies again			0
i 'm probably not going to raise another litter			0
this has just been too stressful			0
i moved here because i thought i would be safe , but after this it does n't seem like that 's the case			0
’ while some dogs are stolen from kennels and outhouses , thieves are getting increasingly bold - with animals being taken as they are being walked by their owners , and others being specifically targeted in burglaries			1
@entity156 ' most popular targets are trained working dogs , such as @entity158 , although other popular types such as chihuahuas and pugs also figure highly in the list of breeds stolen			0
the biggest rise has been in thefts of cocker spaniels , following an increase in popularity after the @entity169 and @entity170 adopted a puppy , @entity172			1
an @entity179 spokesman said : ‘ if people are concerned , they should make sure their pets are microchipped , gardens are secure , their dogs are monitored while in the garden and report suspicious activity to police			1
’ @entity184 , a non-profit organisation that aims to reunite owners with their missing animals , told @entity187 that it does not believe stories of letters or stickers posted on driveways and gates are true			2
a spokesman added : ' nevertheless we would urge all dog owners to be vigilant and not to leave their dogs in gardens or outside shops where they can be seized by dog thieves			1
' the majority of dogs are stolen for monetary gain , and evidence suggests that very few are stolen to be bait dogs			0
the greatest increase in dog theft in the last 12 months has been in gundogs			0
' the increase in theft of cocker spaniels is roughly in line with other gundogs and is not thought to relate to the @entity169 and @entity170 ownership of one			1

lookouts are leaving ' @entity12 in crayon or spray paint after finding dogs
they are *spotting* valuable pets in unwitting owners ' gardens in @entity19
