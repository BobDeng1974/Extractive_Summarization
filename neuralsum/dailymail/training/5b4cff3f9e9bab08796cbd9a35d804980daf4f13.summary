by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter mayflies have started to emerge from the @entity4 in swarms so large that they show up on radar like thunderstorms			1
the insects emerge in large numbers to mate , lay eggs and die , all in less than 48 hours			1
they leave behind a slimy mess which has been blamed for at least one car crash this week in @entity14			1
the @entity15 captured a massive swarm on radar on sunday night as the flies came out of the river and drifted north on the wind			2
the radar system picks up energy reflected off the flies , with the image 's intensity reflecting the density of the bugs			0
a loop recorded on sunday shows yellow patches directly over the river that morph into a green band as the flies drift north			0
the bugs become blue dots as they disperse			0
a second , smaller swarm recorded on thursday night starts as a green band before exploding like fireworks into blue dots			0
the flies hatch and then spend a year burrowed into the sediment on the bottom of the river that serves as a border between @entity14 and @entity44			1
they emerge the next summer to mate , lay eggs and die , all in less than 48 hours			1
the mayflies emerge in large numbers to mate , lay eggs and die , all in less than 48 hours			1
they leave behind a slimy mess which has been blamed for at least one car crash this week in @entity14 ' almost every night in the summer , there 's some sense on the radar that there 's something coming off the river , ' said @entity60 , science and operations officer for the @entity15 in @entity63			1
' we do n't know what kind of bug it is ... until we have people calling or saying , " oh my gosh , there 's mayflies all in the @entity63 area			2
" ' the weather service typically records several swarms each year from june through august			1
air and water temperatures have been usually cool this year , helping explain why sunday 's emergence was the first big one this summer , said @entity79 , a @entity80 biologist			0
attracted by light , mayflies congregate on roads , bridges and other surfaces in piles that can be nearly two feet high			0
cars crush the flies , releasing liquid in the females ' eggs and making roads slick			0
two people were injured on sunday in @entity93 in western @entity14 when a car slid on a road covered by flies , crashed into a second car and then struck a van			1
a massive swarm of mayflies is captured on radar as they emerge from the @entity4 and drift north with the wind in this july 20 photo provided by the @entity15 in @entity63 , @entity14 flies that are n't crushed spend 24 hours shedding exoskeletons in a final stage of development before taking to the air again to mate			1
the females then seek water to lay their eggs			2
' if they happen to come across a cup of beer , they will deposit them in a cup of beer , ' said @entity79 , who needs volunteers to help track the flies ' appearance for his research			0
adult flies die after laying their eggs			2
within hours , their offspring hatch in the river , and the cycle begins again			0
the inserts are sensitive to oxygen levels and pollutants in the river and serve as ' sentinels ' for scientists and others concerned about water quality , said @entity79			0
mayflies disappeared from a 70 - mile area south of the @entity137 in the 1920s and did n't reappear in significant numbers again until 1978 , when wastewater treatment and others actions taken under the @entity142 began to have an impact .			2
