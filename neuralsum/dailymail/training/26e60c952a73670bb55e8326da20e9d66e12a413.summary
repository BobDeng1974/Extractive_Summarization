the black and white lemur shows its dexterity on two legs as it is pictured running along the ground			2
the trick shot , which makes it appear as if there are five lemurs , was taken by @entity14 using time - lapse photography			2
trick shot : a rare sifaka lemur is captured using time lapse photography as it skips across a path in @entity20 up close : @entity21 photographer @entity14 spent time with the charismatic primates during a visit to the @entity25 island and captured the curious creatures in action the @entity21 photographer travelled to @entity20 to get close to the charismatic primates			1
there are more than 100 species of lemur living on the @entity25 island and all sifkaka are endangered and are classed as between vulnerable and critically endangered			1
mr @entity14 , 40 , was able to capture a vast array of species on camera and his intimate collection includes multiple shots of a bright - white lemur scampering across a path and newborn babies clutching onto their mother 's tail			1
however , the expedition was not without drama			0
mr @entity14 said lemurs , such as the ring - tailed , that are thriving on the island are so used to humans that they can cause trouble			1
a troop even raided his hotel room when he left the window open			0
give it to me : a lemur reaches out as if to grab the camera			2
photographer @entity14 said many lemurs live in nature reserves and are used to tourists not camera shy : most lemurs take no notice of tourists snapping away but these individuals certainly took an interest in the cameras happy families : a pair of lemurs cling to a tree in @entity20 , left , while two babies stay close to their mother among the leaves , right curious : two lemurs look suspicious as they crawl along the ground towards the camera , while a nervous companion pokes its head from behind a tree prickly situation : a lemur perches among the thorns in a tree , left , while another poses for the camera as it shows off its climbing skills he said : ' many of the daytime lemur species live in nature reserves and are quite accustomed to tourists taking their photos			1
' they seem to get on with their daily business regardless of who is watching or taking photos of them			0
' some of them are so used to people that they will raid your hotel room looking for food if you leave the window open and will even beg at open - air restaurants			0
' @entity107 did a poo down my shirt during one photo shoot			0
i also woke up in my hotel room in @entity113 to find a troop of ring tailed lemurs bouncing around on the bed with me			0
' they scattered when i woke and shooed them away , but not before stealing my bananas and also my last packet of cigarettes - which i later found shredded and dumped in the forest			0
' on the look out : a ring - tailed lemur sits on the red earth			0
a troop of the species raided photographer @entity14 's hotel room during his visit astounded : @entity14 said he was amazed by the vast range of lemur species in @entity20			1
there are more than 100 species on the island time for your close up : @entity14 was able to shoot the lemurs at very close proximity both up trees and on the ground spectacular sight : the lemur 's expressive face is shown in close detail in @entity14 's photograph a baby brown lemur looks on as it eats some food while staying close to its mother and a baby 's face is captured close up mr @entity14 , a freelance nature photographer from north @entity154 , also travelled to the spiky forests to the south of the island to see species of lemur			1
it can be risky business as the trees are heavily spiked and branches easily break and fall when disturbed by the animals			0
mr @entity14 added : ' i was surprised by how many beautiful lemur species there are - over 100 - and how many of them are close to extinction			1
'' i learned that once upon a time there were lemur species as large as a man			2
now that would have been something to see			0

the image was taken by @entity21 photographer @entity14 who travelled to the @entity25 island to observe the lemurs
there are more than 100 species of lemur in @entity20 but some are so rare they are on the verge of extinction
