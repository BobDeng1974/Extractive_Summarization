the brother of @entity1 launched an extraordinary attack on @entity4 citizens , describing them as ' not normal ' and warning : ' these are black people '			1
@entity6 made the inflammatory comments in a crisis meeting with the parents of murdered bride @entity10 in which the brothers battled to convince them that @entity1 had no part in her death			1
a translated record of the meeting - published today by @entity17 - was secretly taped by @entity19 's cousin on november 22 , 2010 , just days after the @entity21 engineer was buried			1
the meeting , which was conducted in @entity23 and lasted well over two hours , reveals @entity6 's fear that the @entity4 authorities will attempt to frame his brother for murder in order to protect the country 's tourist industry			1
scroll down for full transcript of the meeting ' these are black people ' : @entity1 's brother @entity6 ( left ) launched an inflammatory attack on the @entity4 justice system in a secretly taped recording with the family of honeymoon murder victim @entity19 ( seen , right , with her husband on their wedding day ) over fears the businessman would be framed calling on the families to unite to defend his brother against unscrupulous forces , he warns : ' we are not dealing with anything normal here			1
we are dealing with @entity4			2
' this is not @entity21 or the @entity50 where you have a robust police and court system			0
he was responding to the grieving family 's deep mistrust of the @entity50 businessman , who is currently on trial accused of her murder			1
the transcript was accepted as an accurate record of the conversation by both the prosecution and the defence when it was submitted to the court , but it was not submitted as evidence during the trial			2
the 50 - page record also lays bare a number of striking discrepancies between the story the 34 - year - old gave to his in - laws in november 2010 and the account he offered to a @entity4 court eight weeks ago as he went on trial for mrs @entity19 's honeymoon murder			1
despite glaring variations in his version of events leading up to , and after , his wife 's fatal shooting two weeks after their wedding , @entity1 is next week widely expected to be cleared of having any hand in it			2
it comes as the @entity92 's brother , @entity91 , today made an emotional appeal for @entity1 to be forced to explain how she died			1
the meeting exposes the deep mistrust that @entity19 's parents , @entity98 and @entity99 ( above ) , held towards the @entity50 businessman just days after the @entity21 engineer was buried mr @entity91 said @entity1 , accused of plotting his sister 's kidnap and murder , should not be allowed to leave @entity4 without revealing in his own words how she met her death			1
he said : ' it would be a terrible development to what has been a four - year wait , if we and the people of @entity4 are not afforded the full story			2
' judge @entity114 will rule on an application by the businessman 's legal team to acquit him on five charges , following a threadbare prosecution case against him , which was undermined by a number of legal rulings to exclude testimony			0
@entity124 , 28 - year - old @entity10 's first cousin and confidante , hid a tape recorder in her jacket during the lengthy talks which were organised and chaired by @entity1 's brother , @entity129 , at his family 's @entity130 flat , in an effort to smooth growing tensions			1
mrs @entity124 told @entity1 's trial at the @entity135 that his heartless behaviour and unconvincing story in the wake of her cousin 's murder had aroused her family 's suspicions			1
mrs @entity19 , an engineer , was shot dead when the taxi carrying her and @entity1 through a township on the edge of @entity146 was ambushed by gunmen			2
the driver , @entity149 , and @entity1 were freed unharmed , while the dead body of the bride was found in the abandoned vehicle the following morning			2
@entity149 confessed to organising the murder , but claimed it was masterminded by @entity1			2
@entity155 : @entity19 's cousin , @entity124 , hid a tape recorder in her jacket during the meeting prosecutors believe the new groom 's secret gay life motivated him to want his wife dead			1
in the transcript of the meeting , the @entity91 family 's misgivings about the state of the newlyweds ' relationship are obvious , prompting @entity170 – an @entity172 law graduate – to invite his brother to allay their suspicions			1
. let 's ask @entity1 a direct question			2
was there any involvement ? ' @entity6 asks his brother @entity1 replies : ' no i had nothing to do with it whatsoever			1
even if we had argued , how would i benefit by killing her ? ' as his father - in - law , @entity183 , continues to quiz him about the hours and minutes before his daughter 's death , with mrs @entity124 's face apparently betraying her doubts , @entity6 challenges them to find any motive for his brother to want to kill his new wife			1
' why would you do such a big wedding , with everything that happened , why would , why would you , there is no life policy			0
you tell me – what is the benefit for @entity1 there ? ' @entity170 demands			0
this prompts @entity1 to add : ' why would i spend £ 10,000 for @entity201 tickets to the best hotel in the whole of @entity4 ? ' as @entity1 is encouraged to re-tell his dramatic account of the honeymooners ' late - night ambush by gunmen on a corner in @entity210 which saw him and @entity149 freed unscathed , but @entity10 driven off into the dark , the in - laws interrupt with questions			1
mrs @entity19 's mother , @entity213 , who does not apparently speak until 45 minutes into the crunch talks , appears puzzled by her son - in - law 's claim that he had been pushed , head first , out of a rear window of the moving car and ' rolled out like a roly poly onto the road			0
' ' did you not get hurt then ? ' the 62 - year - old grieving mother demands to know			0
confirming that he was indeed left bruised after landing on his head and shoulder , @entity1 plays down his injuries			0
' i did not hurt myself that much			0
it was all on sand , ' he says , adding that his suit and a white shirt that she had bought for him ' was all – you know – dirty '			0
clearly still unconvinced that two assassins – one of them at the wheel of a moving car in a pair of yellow washing - up gloves and the other brandishing a gun – had somehow managed to wrestle her athletic son - in - law out of a car window , against his will , mrs @entity213 seeks further confirmation that this is what really happened			0
she also wants to know what her daughter was doing while he was being ejected , eventually demanding : ' how you could just leave her with two black men ? ' to which , @entity1 replies : ' i did not have a choice			0
' in the meeting , which was designed to give @entity10 's father the full story from @entity1 , the accused made no mention at all about a helicopter trip he claims he was planning			1
during his trial it has been claimed that he had @entity261 , 000 in @entity10 's handbag to pay for a surprise helicopter trip for his bride and was to ask taxi driver @entity149 to arrange it for him			1
the helicopter ride was not mentioned to police , his public relations guru , the jailed sex pest @entity270 , or a journalist who interviewed him on tape			2
the claim emerged a few years after the murder			0
@entity6 also informs the meeting that he has secured the services of the now - disgraced pr guru @entity270 to limit the damage to the reputation of @entity1 and the successful family business the two brothers still run with their father , @entity282			1
there had been newspaper reports alleging their lucrative string of care homes was in financial straits and the family could gain from an insurance policy on @entity10 's life			1
' we are not in any financial difficulty whatsoever			0
if you want 5 million in cash , i can write you a cheque now			0
' there is no problem with our company - the way we set and structure our company is very clever - because it is there to make sure we ... , ' @entity303 reassures mr @entity91 , 65 , whose mobile phone interrupts his flow			0
the meeting also reveals bitter disagreements over arrangements for the funeral during which the @entity91 family obviously felt sidelined			0
@entity311 , the dead engineer 's sister , was denied time alone with her sister 's body , mr @entity91 suggests			0
at one point , the grieving father - in - law tells @entity1 , ' the look you gave me at the funeral was really scary			2
' he later asks , directing his question apparently at no - one in particular , ' why her ? i should rather have died			0
' @entity1 denies murder and kidnapping			0
