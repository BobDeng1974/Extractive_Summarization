@entity1 mp @entity0 tore into @entity2 and the views of its members some members of the @entity6 @entity2 are ‘ literally akin to the @entity7 ’ , according to a @entity1 mp			1
in an incendiary attack ahead of the @entity10 elections , @entity0 said the @entity12 party had played a helpful role in ‘ cleansing ’ the conservatives of people with extreme views			2
mr @entity0 , an ally of chancellor @entity18 and @entity1 chairman @entity19 , cited the example of @entity2 immigration spokesman @entity21 , who believes that @entity6 @entity22 should sign a special code of conduct rejecting violence			1
he cited the example of @entity2 immigration spokesman @entity21 , who believes that @entity6 muslims should sign a special code of conduct rejecting violence			2
mr @entity0 , who is @entity27 , said : ‘ to me there are two kinds of @entity2 – the [ former defence spokesman ] @entity32 guy who ’s like a cross between @entity34 and @entity35 , and then there 's a much more sinister element , like the @entity38 who said every @entity22 has got to sign a declaration of non-violence , which to me is literally akin to the @entity7 saying @entity27 should wear a yellow star			1
‘ i genuinely find it abhorrent and frightening			0
i 'm amazed that man is still an mep			0
how someone could say such a thing and then not apologise for it … ’ the mp said such people were not welcome in the @entity1 and insisted he was glad they had been driven out by @entity2			1
‘ in many ways @entity2 have done us an enormous favour because they 're cleansing people from the @entity1 party that had these kinds of views , which is great because i do n't want people who have those kinds of views in my party			1
so good luck to them , really , ’ mr @entity0 told political magazine @entity48			1
his incendiary attack on @entity64 ’s party , in the run - up to the @entity10 elections in may , prompted an angry reaction from @entity2 and will divide opinion on the conservative benches			1
the @entity1 leadership has fought shy of making direct attacks on @entity2 since @entity72 prompted a backlash by dismissing the party ’s representatives as ‘ fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ’ in 2006			1
party strategists warned that such remarks risked backfiring and playing into @entity2 hands			2
but some senior @entity82 now appear to have decided to confront the party , which says it is on course to top the polls in elections to the @entity87 on may 22 , more aggressively			2
defence minister @entity88 launched a blistering attack on mr @entity64 when the pair recently appeared on the @entity92 ’s @entity91 , accusing him of putting ‘ fear in people ’s hearts ’ by scaremongering about immigration			2
one @entity1 minister said many in the party had been ‘ appalled ’ by a recent ratcheting up of @entity2 rhetoric , particularly at its spring conference last weekend			2
mr @entity64 used the gathering in @entity104 to express his alarm at hearing foreign languages spoken when he travelled by train			2
but the @entity2 leader attacked mr @entity0 for directing ‘ hysterical slurs ’ at @entity2 and its members and said he intended to step up campaigning in his constituency of @entity113			1
last year in the county council elections , @entity2 scored between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the votes cast in the seat			0
mr @entity64 said : ‘ mr @entity0 's hysterical slurs are the result of a growing @entity1 terror of @entity2 's rising popularity all over the country			1
‘ because i believe in taking politics and the big arguments directly to the people , @entity2 will now be having a national action day in @entity113			0
let the voters of @entity113 hear what we have got to say			0
i know that many of them are already flocking to our side			0
‘ as we approach the next general election , we will also consider whether to add @entity113 to our target seat list given the positive response of people in the town to our message			0
’ mr @entity0 said @entity2 members were either comedy characters like the party 's former @entity38 @entity32 , ( left ) or had more extreme views , such as @entity2 immigration spokesman @entity21 ( right ) , who believes that @entity6 @entity22 should sign a special code of conduct rejecting violence @entity2 @entity146 election candidate @entity145 said : ‘ @entity2 is the only party that believes in standing up for ordinary people by supporting border controls , whilst mr @entity0 's party continues to back uncontrolled mass immigration from the @entity151 with no volume control and no quality control either			1
‘ mr @entity0 ’s idea that a party led by @entity72 and @entity18 will ever appeal to ordinary working families is deluded			1
but it is a shame to see him resort to gutter politics in a desperate bid to save his seat at next year ’s general election			0
’ mr @entity0 used his interview to insist the @entity82 were ‘ slowly ’ demonstrating they are on the side of ‘ white van @entity164 ’			1
‘ the @entity165 give people safety nets , whereas we give them ladders			0
the problem for conservatives is always : what are we about ? @entity173 – well what does that really mean to the person on street ? @entity2 leader @entity64 has sought to prevent further embarrassment for the party by checking the views and background of candidates mr @entity0 went on : ' ‘ sovereignty , @entity10 ... it ’s all esoteric stuff			1
@entity185 is a way of life – by habit you tend to be more traditional and so on			0
but actually the thing that we ’re about is the ladder			0
‘ we ’re slowly doing it , saying we ’re the party for hardworking people , but we ’ve got to build a real narrative around it , a real passion that we ’re there to help the working poor and not only that , we ’re there to help people who are n’t working get into work			0
‘ i believe @entity1 modernisation should be about one thing and that is being the party for the working poor – for people on low incomes			0
and everything else should follow			0
‘ we may get into coalition again , we may even win a small majority of 10 or 20 mps , but we ’ll never have a big majority unless we have a real narrative and working people think that we are speaking for them			0
