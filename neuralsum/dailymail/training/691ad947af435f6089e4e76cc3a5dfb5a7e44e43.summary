schools are producing a generation of ‘ amoral ’ children because staff are too busy chasing exam results to teach pupils the difference between right and wrong , it is claimed today			1
a private school head will claim that teachers - mainly in state schools - are under so much pressure to meet exam targets they are failing to equip pupils with basic values			1
@entity15 , chairman of the @entity16 , will say that private schools , in contrast , are turning out ‘ well - rounded ’ pupils with ‘ moral understanding ’			1
@entity15 , a private school headmaster , has said state school teachers are so busy getting children to pass exams they do n't have time to teach right from wrong in provocative remarks , mr @entity15 will claim that many state school teachers ‘ operate in a climate of fear ’			1
he will suggest that the government ’s regime of testing and league tables is the modern - day equivalent of the birch , which was used to cane pupils until corporal punishment was outlawed in 1986			0
but parents are increasingly ‘ buying in ’ to the idea that only exam scores matter and are demanding ‘ quick - fix results ’			0
mr @entity15 , head of £ 6,867 - a - year @entity42 in @entity43 , which caters for two to 11 - year - olds , will make the claims in a keynote speech to fellow heads at the association ’s annual conference in @entity50			1
too many teachers in state schools are ‘ overwhelmed by the pressure to achieve results ’ and devote too much time to ‘ teaching the basics ’ , he will argue			1
‘ schools are turning out too many amoral children because teachers can not find the time to teach the difference between right and wrong , ’ he says			1
‘ it seems that the only results that matter are those which have created added value in terms of raising a pupil ’s statistical level from one stage to the next , and parents are increasingly buying in to this notion			0
‘ this focus on league tables and attainment levels distracts teachers and effectively disables them from providing children with a more rounded and enriching education - one that will give them the moral compass they need for life			2
’ mr @entity15 will say that the ‘ formation of character is fundamental in education ’ and done ‘ so well ’ in independent schools , which offer a broad curriculum and range of lunchtime and after - school activities			1
mr @entity15 will dismiss the idea that privately educated children do better because they are from privileged backgrounds and argue their success is based on a rich education he will dismiss the argument that privately - educated only succeed in life because they are from ‘ elitist or privileged ’ backgrounds			1
‘ they do well because they have received a value - rich education , provided with love in our independent schools			1
’ learning values allows pupils to ‘ distinguish the good from the bad and the true from the false ’ , mr @entity15 says			2
‘ the very nature of our schools , with their respect for discipline and academic seriousness , sport and culture , citizenship and community , service , environmental awareness , spiritual life and personal responsibility , sends out into the world young people with emotional intelligence , developed moral understanding and a willingness to make a contribution to society , ’ he says			0
these qualities can not be measured by ‘ inspectors ’ tick - charts ’			0
mr @entity15 goes on to say : ‘ we can not measure the growth of maturity in a young person grade by grade			2
‘ it takes time , but if we hold our nerve as educators and as schools - and that may mean resisting the demands of parents who want quick - fix results , or the pressures of external statistical grading systems , not to mention the difficult financial situations that we can face - if we hold our nerve , we will continue to turn out well - rounded individuals who make a difference to society , as we have for many years			2
’ he will say it is important to discuss ‘ values ’ since education ‘ does not seem to be enough ’			0
he will refer to a @entity153 scientist who held extremist views while studying at @entity155 , before renouncing them in the wake of the 2005 @entity159 bombings			0
‘ education is the mark of a civilised society ; we believe it should prevent barbarism			0
but it does not seem to be enough			0
indeed often it is the educated who perpetrate wicked acts			0
’ pupils need to learn how to ‘ think for oneself and choose wisely ’ to help them grapple with ethical issues in future , mr @entity15 will say			2
he adds : ‘ we are gaining the potential to improve the human gene pool , for a good end , the eradication of many diseases - but at what cost ? ’			0
