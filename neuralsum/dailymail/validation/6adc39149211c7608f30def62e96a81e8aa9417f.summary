@entity7 and @entity21 ( pictured with their son ) had spent £ 30 on the day out to @entity9 with 20 month - old @entity10 but they were furious when park owner @entity25 insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead			1
the family refused and left the zoo near @entity32 , @entity33 after just two hours and vowed never to return			1
@entity7 , 32 , said : ' we explained the situation and as it was very cold outside i thought he would be understanding			0
' i even said that if they had any dairy or soya - free food , we would buy that for @entity42			1
' they did n't , but he still insisted he could not eat his lunch in the restaurant			2
the couple had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to lactose and soya the couple had planned to buy their own lunch at @entity9 's restaurant ( pictured ) ' to be honest , we were pretty upset because it seemed totally unreasonable			1
it 's not as if the place was packed because there were plenty of places to sit			0
' i was n't prepared for @entity42 to have to eat his lunch outside in the cold and told the owner that we had two choices - either we were allowed to sit indoors or we would have to leave			2
' but he would n't budge so we left after spending £ 30 to get in and having a visit that lasted just a couple of hours			1
' @entity7 , of @entity69 , @entity33 , added : ' it was actually @entity21 's 32nd birthday and we thought it would be a nice day out , but sadly it was n't			0
' we had been to the park before with a young niece and enjoyed the experience but this time we just felt angry and hurt and certainly wo n't be going back			0
' @entity74 , curator of the animal collection , disputed the family 's claim there was no options for their son at the cafe			2
' we have a menu of 55 items and there are only ten of them that contain soya or dairy , ' he said			0
' any of our cooked meals he would have been fine to eat ; we have jacket potatoes , burgers ... ' but the family were furious when park owner @entity25 insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead the family left the zoo near @entity32 , @entity33 after just two hours and have since vowed never to return mr @entity74 said the family had been asked to leave the restaurant due to the park 's strict policy but claimed they had been offered their own private room instead			1
' we 're only a fairly small park , and we have fairly limited seating so we have a policy that you can not eat outside food from outside in the restaurant			2
it applies across the board			0
' the trouble is if we let one person have a packed lunch , then others see it and start to ask why they have been refused			2
' it just gets very awkward for us because many people and children have special dietary requirements these days			0
' in this case , i spoke to the family and did offer them an empty room nearby where they could still eat indoors , but the mother , in particular , still was n't happy			0
' we also have covered areas outside for people who bring their own food			0
' we are looking at expanding the food range to accommodate more needs but our animals must come first and we ca n't direct funding away from them			0
