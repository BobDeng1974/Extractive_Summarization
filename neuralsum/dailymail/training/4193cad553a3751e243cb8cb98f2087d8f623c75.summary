published : 02:58 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 03:01 est , 14 june 2012 @entity0 is calling for an increase in the minimum wage to protect low - income workers from a ' perfect storm ' of benefit cuts , rising living standards and a lack of jobs			2
the charity called for the rise as part of a package of measures ahead of today 's publication of official figures which they predicted would show an increase in the number of working people in poverty			1
already six in every 10 of the 7.9 million working - age adults in poverty are not from jobless households , it said , because austerity measures are ' disproportionately impacting ' the low - paid			1
pay rise : @entity0 is calling for an increase in the minimum wage to protect low - income workers thousands more than last year are turning to food banks and other charity facilities as average earnings have shrunk 4.4 per cent , the report noted , while pay of @entity37 company directors rose 49 per cent			1
improving that rate requires actions such as reversing cuts to working tax credits and reducing the amount of the new @entity44 people lose when starting a job , from 65 per cent to 55 per cent			2
@entity0 's director of @entity49 poverty @entity47 said : ' despite the government 's rhetoric about making work pay , having a job is no longer necessarily enough to lift someone out of poverty			1
hard - pressed : more working - age adults in poverty now live in working households than in workless ones ' more working - age adults in poverty now live in working households than in workless ones			0
' the government is justifying huge cuts to welfare support for people on low incomes by saying this will incentivise work , but there simply are n't enough decent jobs available			0
' ' we need to see income being distributed more fairly if we are to make any impact on reducing levels of poverty			2
' if we carry on down this path , the @entity49 will return to levels of inequality not seen since @entity80			1
' a @entity82 spokesman said : ' over the last decade vast sums of money have been poured into the benefits system in an attempt to address poverty - Â£ 150 billion was spent on tax credits alone between 2004 and 2010			0
' this approach has failed , with the @entity49 likely to miss its own 2010 child poverty targets			1
' we need to address the root causes of poverty including worklessness			0
' the universal credit will replace a complex mess of benefits and tax credits and make work pay			0
it is estimated that universal credit could lift 350,000 children and 550,000 adults out of poverty			0

charity claims austerity measures are hitting the poor the hardest
