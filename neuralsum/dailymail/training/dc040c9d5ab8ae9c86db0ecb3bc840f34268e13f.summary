by @entity0 published : 03:10 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 06:03 est , 9 september 2013 taxpayer - paid executives running the @entity3 nuclear power plant billed £ 714 to chauffeur - drive a cat , expense claims revealed today			1
bosses at consortium @entity8 ( @entity8 ) also used the perk to pay for flights to the @entity12 golf tournament and @entity14 purchases submitted without receipts			1
@entity8 were brought in to decommission a nuclear plant at @entity3 in @entity17 , but senior staff have now been forced to hand back thousands of pounds after an audit of their claims between 2008 and 2012			1
from more than 606 expense documents it emerged £ 236,781 of claims were requested without a proper description , £ 30,557 worth were purely for personal expenditure and £ 42,711 should not have been claimed at all			1
shocking : executives brought in to decommission part of the @entity28 in @entity17 put in a series of problematic expense claims , including £ 714 to taxi a cat one executive claimed £ 714 for a ' repatriation ' by taxi for themselves ' and the cat ' , another claimed £ 719 for @entity14 buys without receipts and an £ 82 - per - head gourmet dinner in @entity41			1
other claims included a £ 2,795 on flights to the @entity12 golf tournament in @entity45 , @entity46 , and a £ 2,316 @entity48 desktop computer			1
@entity49 , @entity50 mp for @entity51 in @entity17 , which contains @entity3 told @entity53 : ' a workforce that is being asked to accept many changes – including pay restraint – will have many questions			2
' @entity58 for cats and flights to the @entity12 simply beggars belief			0
' anger : local @entity50 mp @entity49 says that the cat claim ' beggars belief ' @entity66 said in a statement its management id not ' understand ' a ' complicated and bureaucratic ' expenses systems			0
it came the day after it was revealed the same senior managers have pocketed more than £ 6million in bonuses over the last three years , despite a series of failings			0
executives seconded to @entity75 to have received bonuses ranging from £ 2 million to £ 2.5 million since 2009			2
the taxpayer - funded bonuses for senior staff at the @entity3 site were paid for using funds from the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) , the public non-departmental body which agreed the terms of the contract under which @entity75 operates			2
energy minister @entity85 revealed that a total of £ 6.6 million was paid out in bonuses			0
in the financial year 2009/10 , @entity8 executives received £ 1,999,192 ; in 2010/11 the figure was £ 2,451,269 and in 2011/12 the executive bonus pot totalled £ 2,148,035			1
the bonuses are likely to be the subject of much scrutiny after a series of setbacks at the site , which according to the firm 's deputy managing director @entity98 houses the most hazardous industrial building in western @entity101			0
a contract was awarded to @entity8 to run the @entity104 site for up to a maximum of 17 years starting in 2009 - including a break clause after the first five years - in the belief that the private sector would be able to manage the site more efficiently			2
but a report by the @entity111 found that costs had spiralled from £ 47 billion , when it first started work on the site in 2009 , to £ 67 billion by 2012 after key deadlines were missed			2
in june , the company was fined £ 700,000 and ordered to pay more than £ 72,000 costs for sending bags of radioactive waste to a landfill site in @entity17			0
taxi ! the executive claimed the taxpayer should fund a journey for him ' and the cat ' ( file picture ) the bonuses were disclosed in answer to a parliamentary question from @entity129 , former leader of the @entity130 ( @entity130 )			0
the @entity132 mp , who is also the @entity130 's shadow spokewoman on energy , said : ' the government and the @entity81 have serious questions to answer about this			0
' it is unacceptable for this amount of public money to be paid in bonuses to a private consortium whose management of the decommissioning process at @entity3 has been so appalling			1
' this is a consortium who in 2010/11 failed to meet targets in 12 of 14 major projects , yet in the same year senior executives received over £ 2 million in bonuses			1
' the @entity81 is currently reviewing the performance of @entity8 and a decision on whether or not to extend the contract into its second term or make use of the break clause will be decided in due course			2
a spokeswoman for @entity8 said : ' whilst we do not disclose information on the private financial arrangements between @entity8 ( @entity162 ) and its personnel , the bonus levels of executive directors seconded to @entity75 reflect the fee that @entity8 earns , based upon meeting performance targets agreed annually with the @entity81			0
' there is therefore a clear link between the payment of bonuses and performance			0
2012/13 bonus levels - not included in the data quoted - were lower to reflect this year 's performance in that financial year			0
' the bonuses of @entity8 seconded @entity75 executive directors are included in the overall executive remuneration costs which are published each year in the @entity180 and @entity181			1
