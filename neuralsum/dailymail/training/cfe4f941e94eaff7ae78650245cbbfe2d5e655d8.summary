by @entity0 published : 15:10 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 08:30 est , 5 february 2013 we missed him : analysis of @entity5 bones using new carbon dating techniques shows they could never have coexisted with humans neanderthals and the ancestors of modern humans never co-existed , according to a new study which , if correct , could rewrite conventional accounts of our species early history			1
the study suggests that our evolutionary cousins became extinct in their last refuge in @entity19 much earlier than previously thought			0
previous dating of bone fossils found at @entity5 sites in the region put the youngest at about 35,000 years			1
now researchers from @entity25 and @entity26 have re-examined the bones using an improved method to filter out contamination and concluded that the remains are actually about 15,000 years older			1
if true , the study casts doubt on the idea that modern humans and @entity5 co-existed - and possibly even interbred - for millennia			1
humans are n't believed to have settled in the region until 42,000 years ago , but the new dating has neanderthals disappearing from there around 50,000 years ago			1
' the results of our study suggest that there are major problems with the dating of the last neanderthals in modern - day @entity19 , ' said @entity49 , deputy director of the @entity50 at @entity51			2
' it is unlikely that @entity5 survived any later in this area than they did elsewhere in mainland @entity26			2
' the study , which was published today by the journal @entity57 , does not completely exclude the possibility that @entity5 survived until 35,000 years ago			2
the problem is that the warm climate on the @entity61 quickly degrades a key protein used in so - called radiocarbon dating			1
the researchers were only able to test bones from two of the 11 known @entity5 sites in @entity19			2
they were subjected to a new method called ' ultrafiltration			0
' this removes more recent carbon molecules that have contaminated the bones and made them appear younger than they actually are			0
much older : the study casts doubt on the idea that modern humans and @entity5 co-existed - and possibly even interbred - for millennia humans living 40,000 years ago in the area around @entity82 were already genetically distinct from the ancestors of modern @entity26 , dna analysis has found			1
an international team of researchers sequenced dna that had been extracted from the leg of an early modern human from @entity89 near to the @entity91 capital			1
analyses showed that the @entity89 human shared a common origin with the ancestors of many present - day @entity96 and native americans - but had already diverged genetically from ancient @entity26			0
the researchers also found that the proportion of @entity5 and @entity101 in the early modern human was no higher than in the present day population of this region			1
researchers with the @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity107 , took nuclear and mitochondrial dna from a 40,000 year old leg bone unearthed at the @entity89 in 2003			0
study leader @entity111 said : ' this individual lived during an important evolutionary transition when early modern humans , who shared certain features with earlier forms such as @entity5 , were replacing @entity5 and @entity117			1
' such techniques often lead to older radiocarbon dates , said @entity120 , a senior research fellow at @entity122 's @entity121			0
' science moves on and technology moves on , ' he said			0
mr @entity120 , who was not involved in the study , said the new techniques should now be applied to other sites in @entity19			0
' until this is done , there must be a significant question mark over the possible late survival of @entity5 in the region			0
' if the remains from the other sites , too , turn out to be older , any encounter between @entity5 and humans would have to have taken place earlier than previously thought , he said			2
' evidence from @entity122 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity107 and @entity142 is increasingly pointing to a modern human presence before 40,000 years ago , ' said mr @entity120			0
' the new chronology suggests that any interaction between the last @entity5 and the earliest moderns in @entity26 will similarly move before , rather than after , 40,000 years			1
' there is also the chance that @entity5 survived longer in other corners of @entity26 , said @entity150 of the @entity151 in @entity152 , a co-author of the study			0
' there are some other possible areas that may have also acted as a refuge for the species , such as the @entity158 , but the " young " radiocarbon dates in these areas have also found to be problematic , ' she said .			0

new radiocarbon dating suggests @entity5 disappeared 15,000 years before the arrival of early modern humans
findings cast doubt on the idea that humans and @entity5 co-existed - and possibly even interbred
