he added that it was ‘ clearly a factor ’ in the recent bad weather			1
the comments come amid growing criticism from @entity35 backbenchers that politicians were assigning blame for the extreme conditions to climate change , despite there being little evidence			2

mr @entity1 said a further 5,000 troops were on standby to offer their services to flood - stricken communities , but he risked angering councils by suggesting many of them had not asked the @entity54 for help soon enough			2

he said climate scepticism among his backbenchers meant that the prime minister ’s ability to give leadership was seriously hampered			0
‘ we have always warned that climate change threatens national security because of the consequences for destabilisation of entire regions of the world , mass migration of millions of people and conflict over water or food supplies , ’ said mr @entity0			1
' because of political division in @entity99 , we are sleepwalking into a national security crisis on climate change ' @entity0 , @entity8 leader ‘ but the events of the last few weeks have shown this is a national security issue too , with people ’s homes , businesses and livelihoods coming under attack from extreme weather			1

‘ but because of political division in @entity99 , we are sleepwalking into a national security crisis on climate change			1
the terrible events of the last few weeks should serve as a wake - up call for us all			0

the rest said they did not know			0
mr @entity1 offered some backing to the @entity129 on @entity130 , saying : ‘ all the evidence suggests that climate change is a significant factor in the weather patterns that we ’re seeing and @entity0 is n’t saying anything new			1

’ last night @entity35 mp for @entity168 , @entity169 , said : ‘ when politicians like @entity0 start talking about climate change , it ’s because he has n’t not anything else to talk about			1

‘ so all he is left doing is talking in abstract terms about changing the weather			0
