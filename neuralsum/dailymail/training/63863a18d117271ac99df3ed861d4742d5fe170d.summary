unemployment among the under - 25s in the region stands at 56.1 per cent - the highest in @entity11 in 2013 according to @entity44 - and local mobsters thrive by offering idle youngsters well - paid work , luring them into their networks			0
the @entity50 pope has previously denounced @entity11 's mafia organisations - which also include @entity53 's @entity52 and @entity54 , @entity56 's @entity55 and @entity59 's @entity58 - warning mobsters to relinquish their ' bloodstained money ' which ' can not be taken to heaven '			2
tragic : @entity16 was home to @entity63 ( pictured ) , a three - year - old shot dead in january alongside his grandfather in a suspected mafia hit pope @entity1 will spend saturday in the villages of @entity69 and @entity70 in @entity3 - a region in southern @entity11 that is under the pervasive grip of the immensely powerful and secretive ' @entity74 mafia after meeting relatives of mafia victims in may - including the families of butchered children and priests - he told gangsters that they would ' go to hell ' if they did not repent			1
when @entity82 voiced a similar threat in @entity53 in 1993 , @entity52 responded by bombing two historic churches in @entity85			0
@entity1 's determination to rattle organised crime groups has sparked warnings that he himself could become a target for the mafia			1
in november , respected @entity3 state prosecutor @entity92 said ' @entity74 was ' nervous '			1
' if the mafia bosses can trip him up , they wo n't hesitate , ' he said			0
the @entity20 brushed off the warning , insisting there was ' no reason for concern '			1
yesterday they also moved to ease renewed concerns about the pope 's health , following his decision to suspend all midweek audiences to cancel his popular morning @entity23 until september , and all general mid-week audiences in july			2
fear : the discovery of the bodies of three - year - old @entity108 and his grandfather in a burnt - out @entity111 ( pictured ) sent shockwaves through @entity11 reverend @entity113 , a consultant to the @entity20 press office , told @entity115 : ' there is no sickness whatsoever ... if there was , we would be open about that and asking people to pray for him			2
' the town of @entity16 , nestled at the bottom of a steep mountain , was home to @entity92 ' @entity63 , a three - year - old shot dead in january along with his grandfather			1
the murders were apparent mafia assassinations over money			0
the discovery of their bodies in a burnt - out @entity111 sent shockwaves through @entity11 , as did the murder just two months later of another three - year - old in the nearby @entity59 region			0
during his visit to @entity69 prison , the 77 - year - old pope will meet @entity63 's father , who was serving time in prison alongside the toddler 's mother for drug crimes when their son was killed			1
he may also meet the man who murdered priest @entity151 , who was beaten to death with an iron bar the same month after a failed extortion attempt			0
poor : unemployment among the under - 25s in @entity3 ( pictured ) stands at 56.1 per cent - the highest in @entity11			2
local mobsters thrive by offering idle youngsters well - paid work , luring them into their networks the ' @entity74 plays a leading role in the global cocaine trade and its bastion , the @entity3 region , is a major transit point for drug shipments from @entity167 to the rest of @entity169			2
it has benefitted in the past from historic ties to the @entity172 , with dons claiming to be @entity175 - fearing @entity174 and priests turning a blind eye to crimes			0
but over the past 20 years numerous priests have taken part in the fight against the clans - sometimes paying for their bravery with their lives			0
@entity1 is likely to call on anti-mafia campaigners to continue their struggle , praising the work of organisations like @entity189 in @entity190 , which has transformed a gambling arcade and drug - trafficking base into a community for handicapped people			2
he may also hail the courage of those who break ranks with the mob despite the clans ' stringent code of loyalty , which punishes rebellion by death			0
the ' @entity74 has been successful in combining elements of archaic tradition with modernity and has proved particularly difficult to infiltrate because of its reliance on a tightly knit network of families			0
but a small but growing number of wives and daughters in particular are speaking out against their mobster fathers , brothers or sons .			0
