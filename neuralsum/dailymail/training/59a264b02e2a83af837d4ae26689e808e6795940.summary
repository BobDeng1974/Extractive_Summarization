the embattled lender broke the grim news to employees yesterday as it revealed its profits for last year had slumped to £ 246million , from £ 5.9billion a year earlier			0
the huge drop was driven in part by a £ 2.5billion bill for mis - selling payment protection insurance and complicated ‘ interest rate swaps ’ to small businesses			0
but campaigners last night asked why @entity2 was awarding huge bonuses after ‘ one of the worst years in its history ’			0
the bank has been fighting to restore its reputation since being fined £ 290million last summer for rigging crucial interest rates			2
@entity27 , who replaced disgraced former boss @entity28 following the debacle , yesterday promised ‘ no going back to the old ways ’ as he revealed his plans to turn @entity2 into the ‘ go - to ’ bank for customers and shareholders			2
he said ‘ we get it ’ , referring to the public anger about the behaviour of the 320 - year - old bank			2
speaking at @entity41 ’s @entity40 , surrounded by walls emblazoned with the bank ’s five new core values – respect , integrity , service , excellence and stewardship – mr @entity27 confirmed plans to shut down its controversial ‘ tax avoidance ’ arm , @entity53			1

critics poured scorn on its efforts to show restraint on bonuses			0
the bonus pool was cut from £ 2.2billion to £ 1.85billion , and @entity2 has also cut bonuses for investment bankers by 15 per cent to £ 1.3billion			2
despite this , staff will receive average bonuses of £ 51,400 , even though they work in the part of the bank involved in the rigging of interest rates			2
@entity77 , chairman of the @entity78 , said : ‘ this will look like more of the same to members of the public			0
‘ the idea that any bonuses should be paid out after one of the most scandalous years in @entity2 ’ long history infringes on most people ’s idea of fairness			0

' there is no doubt that 2012 was a difficult year for @entity2 and the entire banking sector , ' he said			2
' the behaviours which made headlines during the year stemmed from a period of 20 years in banking in which the sector became too aggressive , too focused on the short - term , and too disconnected from the needs of customers and clients , and wider society			0
' @entity2 was not immune from the impact of these trends , and we suffered reputational damage in 2012 as a consequence , ' @entity130 is needed both in our industry and at @entity2			0

he said the bank 's compensation ratio - pay as a proportion of revenues - had fallen to 38 per cent from 42 per cent in 2011			1
mr @entity27 announced he was waiving his bonus for 2012 earlier this month , but the overall staff bonus pot for 2012 is likely to stoke further controversy given the recent series of scandals to rock the group			0
his overhaul - dubbed @entity151 - saw the bank broken down into 75 business units , which were examined for both their potential to generate sustainable profit and their ability to inflict reputational damage			1
