by @entity0 the @entity2 @entity1 has vowed to lift a ban on @entity2 military fighting overseas in a move that will raise tension with @entity7			1
signalling a potential landmark change in a security policy long constrained by a pacifist , post-war constitution prime minister @entity11 pledged that @entity2 would stick to a peaceful path and not again become a ' country that wages war '			1
' @entity2 has walked the path of a peaceful country for nearly 70 years since the end of @entity18			1
that path will not change			0
@entity2 prime minster @entity11 has vowed to lift a ban on @entity2 military fighting overseas in a move that will raise tension with @entity7 ' but we can not protect our peaceful lives simply by repeating that we are a peaceful country			1
our peaceful lives may suddenly confront a crisis			0
can anyone say that wo n't happen ? ' @entity11 said at a nationally televised news conference			2
' i think that we , the government , must confront this reality head on , ' he said , explaining why the review was needed			0
pointing to growing tensions due to @entity7 's increasing assertiveness and @entity35 's nuclear threat , @entity11 called for a review of a decades - old interpretation of the constitution that has banned @entity2 from exercising its right of collective self - defence , that is deploying its military to aid friendly countries under attack			1
a lifting of the ban would be welcome to @entity2 's ally the @entity47 , but the proposal drew criticism from @entity7 , whose ties with @entity52 have been strained by a territorial row and the legacy of @entity2 's past aggression			1
protesters hold placards during a protest against the @entity2 government 's plans to lift a ban on using self - defence the protestors urged the prime minister to protect war - renouncing article 9			1
the placards read ' no need right of collective self - defense ' protesters hold placardthe placard , second right , reads : ' no need for collective self - defense ' ' we 've noted that prime minister @entity11 has taken a series of unprecedented actions in the areas of military and security , which leads us to believe that @entity2 , as far as history is concerned , has started on a negative path , ' said @entity83 spokeswoman @entity82 , a spokeswoman for @entity7 's foreign ministry			1
@entity86 countries embroiled in territorial rows with @entity88 in the @entity89 could take a different view			0
' the @entity2 military can somewhat bring ' balance ' to the region that is now under a ' threat ' from a rising and increasingly aggressive @entity7 , ' said @entity95 of the @entity96 of the @entity97 in @entity98			1
' countries in @entity100 , especially those whose citizens suffered from the horrors brought about by the @entity104 during @entity18 such as @entity105 and the @entity106 , should not worry about this move by @entity2 because the country has long veered away from its imperialist past and is drifting more toward being an active regional power that maintains close partnerships with its friends , ' he added			2
critics say the proposed changes would gut @entity116 9 and are a stealth attack on the constitution that would skirt formal amendment procedures that would be tougher politically @entity11 also said @entity2 should strengthen its ability to respond to so - called ' grey zone ' incidents - low intensity conflicts that fall short of a full - scale attack			2
concerns about such clashes have increased due to the tense feud between @entity7 and @entity2 over tiny disputed islands in the @entity129			1
but @entity11 said the government would not adopt a recommendation by his private advisers that @entity2 also lift its ban on taking part in @entity136 - led collective security operations , in which nations join together to propel an aggressor against one state			2
in their report issued earlier , @entity11 's advisers urged sweeping changes in a security policy long based on the principle that @entity2 has the right to defend itself with the minimum force necessary , but that combat abroad exceeds the limit imposed by the constitution 's pacifist article 9			1
critics say the proposed changes would gut @entity116 9 and are a stealth attack on the constitution that would skirt formal amendment procedures that would be tougher politically			0
protestors against the proposed change lined the street near @entity11 's office , shouting ' do n't destroy the constitution			1
' the constitution has never been formally revised since its adoption in 1947 , although successive governments have stretched its limits , which if taken literally ban the maintenance of any armed forces at all			0
the @entity2 surrender at @entity166 , 2 september 1945			0
admiral @entity167 signs the surrender for @entity169 @entity11 , who took office for a rare second term in 2012 , has made clear his desire to loosen the limits of the @entity47 - drafted charter long considered overly restrictive by conservatives			2
the @entity177 edition on monday , september 3 , 1945 @entity11 's handpicked advisers said @entity2 's increasingly tough security environment meant the nation could not defend itself fully under the current interpretation of the constitution			1
' we have reached a situation in which we can not sufficiently maintain our country 's peace and security or realise peace and prosperity of the region and international society under the current interpretation of the constitution , ' report said			0
@entity11 said if the review concluded a new interpretation of the constitution was needed , he would like to embody the change in a cabinet resolution followed by revisions to relevant laws			0
but doubts remain about how far and how quickly @entity11 can proceed			0
his @entity203 's junior partner , the @entity204 , is wary , some in the @entity203 are also cautious , voters are divided and the @entity203 's deputy leader is worried about the impact on local polls this year and next			0
critics say even small changes would open the door to more drastic moves later			0
' considering the nature of collective self - defence , to say it would be ' limited ' is impossible , ' said @entity217 , a former defence official who worked for @entity11 during his first 2006 - 2007 term as premier			0
the advisers cited examples of actions @entity2 should be able to take			0
among them were protecting a @entity47 warship under attack in waters near @entity2 ; mine - sweeping in sea - lanes in a conflict zone ; and intercepting a ballistic missile headed for @entity47			2
they also recommended legal changes to allow action in other cases where the military has been constrained by legal concerns , such as rescuing @entity2 overseas and using weapons in @entity136 peace - keeping operations			2

he said his country will not again become a ' country that wages war '
