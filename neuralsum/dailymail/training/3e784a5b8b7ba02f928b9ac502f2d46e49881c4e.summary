' we said before the game it would be tough , and they would put men behind the ball , and tonight it was , ' @entity0 told @entity20			1
it was close , so i was focusing on trying to get it up and over the wall as quick as i could , and thankfully it 's gone in			0

' we saw the game out well , and we are always learning as a team			0
it 's nights like tonight that will help us			2
' it was reported @entity8 was preparing to substitute @entity0 for @entity65 striker @entity34 , but the former @entity67 starlet seemed to be unaware of the swap when asked after the match			2
' i 've shown over the years that i am always capable of scoring goals , and thankfully i 've done that again tonight , ' he replied			0

' no doubt you 're going to produce some evidence in a minute about a form going in , but that was n't my intention			0
we were going to put @entity34 on and we were discussing which of the forwards to take off			0
' i had n't made up my mind , it was probably more likely to be @entity41 and it had to be @entity41 in the end because he tweaked his ankle			0
' @entity0 , @entity1 's captain , tries his luck against @entity4 in the @entity103 clash earlier in the game @entity0 is chased by @entity105 during the match as @entity1 tried to keep their 100 per cent record intact @entity8 added @entity41 's ' rolled ankle ' was of no concern and that the @entity111 striker should be fine by the weekend			1
the @entity1 boss did , however , admit that he found it frustrating to be all square after 45 minutes			2
' to come in at half - time , after playing like that , at 0 - 0 there was an air of frustration , ' @entity8 added			2
' we had so many opportunities in and around the box , you think we had to take one , and we did n't			0
' thankfully we took one in the second half and it 's four wins in a row , five clean sheets , these are things not to be sniffed at			0
