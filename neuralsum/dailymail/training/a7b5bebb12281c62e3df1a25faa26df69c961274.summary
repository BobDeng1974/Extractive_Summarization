drama : respected councillor @entity10 ( left , with wife @entity24 ) , called @entity15 ( right ) a ' little s * * * ' before threatening to punch him during the tombola row picturesque : the furious row has caused unprecedented drama in the beautiful historic village of @entity8 and faced with the verbal assault on his wife 's ability to run the historic fair , mr @entity10 raged during the council meeting : ' one more word from you and i will thump you			1
' in dramatic scenes at odds with the usual sedate pace of village council meetings , mr @entity10 also branded mr @entity15 a ' little s * * * ' , before threatening legal action against him			1
the unprecedented ugly scenes saw mr @entity10 suspended from the 120 - year - old @entity44 for swearing at and threatening mr @entity15			1
the spat began when prizes donated to the @entity8 raffle by village businesses were allegedly offered at the tombola instead			0
mr @entity15 also used his chance to make a statement at the meeting to vent his anger at supposed errors with the raffle and tombola prizes			0
mrs @entity19 's husband @entity57 , a local optician who has lived in the village for 30 years and a parish councillor for 25 years , lost his cool over what he regarded as unfounded criticism			2
quiet : the furious exchange in @entity8 caused drama at the normally sedate public meeting for the @entity66 he stood up and described mr @entity15 as ' a little s * * * ' , before adding : ' shut your mouth ...			1
one more word from you and i will thump you now			0
' mr @entity10 , who is also trustee and secretary of the friends of @entity76 , also warned mr @entity15 : ' you will be hearing from my solicitor '			2

' mrs @entity19 said her husband was simply doing what anyone would have done in the circumstances if their partner was criticised in public			2
she said : ' it 's been very stressful			0
we are not going to stand down			0
' we have been voted in by lots of people and i am a bit vocal and stand up for things - sometimes that goes against you			0
' mr @entity10 's outburst was so shocking that another member of the public at the meeting complained to @entity81 about the 66 - year - old 's behaviour			1
a hearing was held in february following an investigation			0
criticism : @entity15 , a member of the public , had made a statement attacking @entity19 for her role in organising the village fair in @entity8 long - standing : mr @entity10 , who has stood on the local authority for 30 years , has been suspended for six weeks following the outburst the sub-committee concluded that mr @entity10 had failed to treat mr @entity15 with respect , contrary to the code of conduct and had brought the office of councillor and the parish council into disrepute			1
