@entity0 has been accused by veteran @entity2 comic @entity1 of ripping off a @entity4 sketch that aired on saturday night that featured guest host @entity6			1
the funnyman , who is a tutor at @entity2 ' legendary @entity9 comedy troupe , said that the skit which lampooned @entity4 impersonators on a river cruise was originally performed by his students , @entity14 and @entity15 over the summer			1
in both sketches , impersonators of the superstar wear sequined red mini-dresses and wigs in the style of @entity4 's iconic 80s hairstyle and sing along to ' @entity23 ' while taking it in turns to make jokes about their prior , failed lives			1
scroll down for @entity28 saturday night : @entity6 ( left ) , @entity29 and @entity30 ( right ) performed their @entity4 sketch over the weekend on the iconic @entity34 live comedy show controversy : @entity14 and @entity15 perform their @entity4 sketch as part of the @entity2 comedy troupe , the @entity38 in september however , while both sketches have striking , almost identical similarities , the snl skit featuring @entity6 , @entity29 and @entity30 is shorter , has different punch lines and is tighter paced according to the @entity43			1
after @entity0 's @entity4 sketch aired on saturday , @entity1 , who is a teacher at the @entity9 troupe claimed enough was enough and took to @entity47 to vent his anger at the iconic @entity34 show which is helmed by @entity50 , @entity51			1
taking care to praise @entity0 as a promoter of comedic talent and a chief influence , @entity1 said he is not out to ' attack ' the show , but wanted everyone to know his protégés performed their @entity4 sketch first , in september			1
however , he goes on to say : ' but , over the years i have seen many many sketches flat out stolen from my friends by @entity0			2
defence : @entity1 ( right ) took to social media over the weekend to point out the similarities between the @entity38 @entity4 sketch and @entity0 's ' nearly verbatim			1
word for word ... and everyone in our community goes ' oh man			0
' and nobody says anything because i guess @entity0 is still some dream for some people or they do n't want to get involved , or a million other reasonable things that stop people from standing up for each other when things are blatantly wrong			2
' to prove his point , @entity1 posted pictures to the social media network of the stars of @entity38 and @entity0 each wearing their very similar costumes			2
warming to his theme , @entity1 said that he felt that in this particular case , he had to speak out			0
and we have the means to make people aware of blatant rip offs of other peoples material , ' wrote @entity1			0
' it does n't need to be a witch hunt			0
it does n't need to be pointing fingers , assigning blame , or taking sides			0
but a simple case of what 's right and wrong			0
' @entity15 also wrote her opinion of the controversy as a post to @entity47			2
spot the difference : @entity1 uploaded to @entity47 this split picture of his students , @entity14 and @entity15 ( left ) in their @entity4 outfits as compared to the costumes @entity29 and @entity30 ( right ) wore over the weekend ' if you liked the sketch @entity0 did last night about a @entity4 tribute band musing and singing to ' @entity116 ' on a @entity117 , ' then you 'll love this sketch @entity119 and i wrote and performed for six weeks this summer at @entity38 about a @entity4 tribute band musing and singing to ' @entity116 ' on a @entity117 ! ' a source at @entity0 told the @entity123 that they had no knowledge of the @entity38 sketch and totally refuted any accusations they stole it			1
' it 's a common idea since @entity4 is such an iconic figure			0
the similarities represent parallel thinking in the comedy world , ' the source said .			0
