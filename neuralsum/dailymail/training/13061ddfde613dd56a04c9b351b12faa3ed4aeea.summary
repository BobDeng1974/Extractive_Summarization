by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:35 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 04:59 est , 14 january 2014 victim : this elderly woman - ' @entity4 ' - was so badly beaten up by a gang of muggers that she was too scared to tell anyone what had happened for five days an 80 - year - old grandmother was beaten up by a gang of muggers after she told them smoking was bad for their health , it was revealed today			1
the pensioner , who has been named only as ‘ @entity4 ’ , was on a shopping trip to buy groceries when she was ambushed by the men and beaten so savagely that she was too frightened to reveal her ordeal for five days			1
during the assault in @entity24 , @entity25 , the yobs told her : ‘ do n’t talk to us like that ’ - then punched her in the face whilst she was on her knees , begging them to stop			1
despite extensive bruising the widow managed to stagger home after the assault , but was so traumatised she refused to step out into the street again - for fear the yobs might be waiting for her outside to give her a second beating			1
the alarm was only raised when she was paid a visit by her daughter @entity38 , 44 , who was left shocked at the bruising on her face			1
she posted a picture of the pensioner ’s injuries on @entity44 in an appeal for help in catching the culprits - and this was spotted by police			1
today , detectives investigating the attack issued the image of the woman ’s injuries in the hope it might shame the yobs into turning themselves in			1

if i could speak to her attackers i would say hand yourself in - you need some help			1
if someone did that to your mother or grandmother you would n’t like it			2
‘ i have had plenty of offers to have these lads sorted out - but if i did anything like that i would be just as bad as them			1
sadly it ’s going to take a long time for my mum to feel safe in her own house			2

she is a strong lady			2
she ’s been on her own since dad died 28 years ago			2
somebody must know who has done it			2

these youth must have some sort of a conscience			0
they need to hand themselves in			0
