@entity0 is famous for his use of bold lines and colourful imagery to depict @entity5 life			1
@entity6 is known , however , about the techniques and materials the @entity10 artist used to create his unusual and complex graphic works			1
now a team of @entity14 scientists and artists have used a light bulb , an slr camera and a laptop to uncover new remarkable new details of @entity0 's printmaking process			1
the technique allowed the researchers to separate colour from surface shape , providing a much clearer view of the paper 's topography			2
for the study of an artwork , the piece was fixed in place , as was an slr camera			1
a light bulb was moved to 20 different locations and a photo taken of the artwork for each light bulb position			1
the digital data for each pixel of each image then was run through @entity53 's software			0
essentially , the researchers were measuring only the response of an artwork 's surface to changing lighting			0
for each image , they knew the angle of the lighting and the brightness of each pixel and from that they could can calculate the unknown - the surface structure			1
researchers at @entity65 say @entity0 formed , layered and re-used imagery to make 19 unique graphic works			1
the technique was originally revealed by peeling back layers of the 3d surface of the print ' @entity26 ( @entity72 ) , ' made by @entity0 in 1902			1
@entity0 created the print using a layering of images created on paper by drawings , transfer of images and two different inks			2
the ' nativity ' findings overturn an earlier theory as to how @entity0 might have produced the print			2
@entity85 , who led the research , was ' blown away ' by the scientific results , so the his team reproduced what they believed to be @entity0 's process			0
the printmaking process produced a piece of art very similar to @entity0 's original			0
' to measure the @entity97 surface of the prints , we used some very accessible techniques that can be used by art conservators and historians around the world to analyse artworks , ' said @entity85 , who developed the software to analyse the imaging data			0
' in applying these techniques to @entity0 's work , we came up with some interesting answers to questions about what his printing process was			0
' as well as ' nativity ' , the team studied 18 other @entity0 monoprints in the @entity117 's collection			0
they used multiple wavelengths of light shining from different directions onto the prints to investigate the surface of the paper and re-evaluate how @entity0 created his works			1
the technique allowed the researchers to separate colour from surface shape , providing a much clearer view of the paper 's topography			2
the scientists used multiple wavelengths of light shining from different directions onto @entity0 's @entity137 technique allowed the researchers to separate colour from surface shape , providing a much clearer view of the paper 's topography @entity85 , who led the research , was ' blown away ' by the results , so the his team reproduced what they believed to be @entity0 's @entity146 printmaking process produced art similar to @entity0 's original for the study of an artwork , the piece was fixed in place , as was an slr camera			1
a light bulb was moved to 20 different locations and a photo taken of the artwork for each light bulb position			1
the digital data for each pixel of each image then was run through @entity53 's software			0
essentially , the researchers were measuring only the response of an artwork 's surface to changing lighting ' the technique allows us to peel away the print 's colour and look at the surface structure only , ' @entity85 said			1
' for each image , we know the angle of the lighting and the brightness of each pixel and from that we can calculate the unknown - the surface structure			1
' the surface structure of ' nativity ' revealed white lines , in which there is an absence of ink			2
this indicates those lines were created using a transfer process , where @entity0 drew on an inked surface , removing ink , and those empty lines were transferred to his print			2
using a simple light bulb , an slr camera , and computer software , researchers have uncovered new details of @entity10 artist @entity0 â€™s printmaking method the ink of the black lines sits atop ridges in the paper			1
@entity0 would have placed his paper on an inked surface and then drawn on the back of the paper , causing ink to be transferred to the paper where pressure from the artist 's pencil was applied			2
' @entity0 died more than a century ago , but there is still something to say , something new to find out , in large part due to this teamwork , ' said @entity211 , senior research conservator at the @entity117 and the museum 's lead collaborator on the @entity0 project			0
' @entity0 probably was doing these kinds of prints for five years , so this research puts a whole body of work together , ' she said			0
' the evidence points to a completely different artistic approach by @entity0			0
' @entity222 says that information such as this can be included in augmented reality apps to help art lovers learn more about prints just by pointing your phone at them			0
@entity0 was a @entity10 post-impressionist artist			0
he is famous for his use of bold lines and colourful imagery to depict @entity5 life .			0

scientists separated colour from shape using light and an slr camera
light bulb was moved to different locations and a photo taken of the print
from this , they were able to calculate the surface structure *beneath* paint
@entity0 formed , layered and re-used imagery to make 19 graphic works
