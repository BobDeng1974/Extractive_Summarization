it involved social workers making lurid claims about satanic rituals being performed on children and , as a result , 20 children from six families were placed in care			0
however , the police found no evidence and a government - backed inquiry subsequently blamed ‘ evangelical @entity171 ’ for the scare			0

' i knew what he did for a living and could n't believe how debauched he was , ' escort @entity204 , 21 , told @entity149 ' every time he saw me he knew he was risking everything — but he just did n't seem to care			0
he took me to the theatre and gave me presents like chocolate and wine			0
i was old enough to be his grandson but he did n't seem to think we looked like the odd couple			0
