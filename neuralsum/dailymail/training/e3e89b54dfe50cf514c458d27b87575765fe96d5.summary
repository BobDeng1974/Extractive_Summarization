@entity1 community leader @entity0 has accused the @entity2 of exaggerating the home - grown militants problem			1
there are reports that @entity7 radicals have @entity8 in their sights and that counter-terror agencies are preparing to lift the country 's alert status to high			1
but the president of the @entity14 of @entity8 ( @entity15 ) says the concerted ' negative campaigns ' against the building of mosques is a major part of the problem which has ' radicalised some of our youth '			1
' we want to be part of the solution but denying us the ability to build more prayer facilities , enabling us to reach out to those lost souls , is making it too easy for the radical minority to win , ' mr @entity0 said			1
@entity0 arrives at a recent meeting with the prime minister and attorney - general @entity34 to discuss the home - grown terror threat			1
' i wonder whether sometimes they are just shooting in the dark , just do n't know the dynamics of the situation are , or do n't want a real solution ' attorney - general @entity34 and prime minister @entity43 have announced a suite of counter-terrorism and border protection measures in the past month worth more than $ 600 million ' it was to their credit that we 've had these meetings but the government , i wonder whether sometimes they are just shooting in the dark , just do n't know the dynamics of the situation are , or do n't want a real solution , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' the level of alarm that has been raised i feel is exaggerated			1
this is a fear of just a handful of individuals			0
' anyone who knows anything about the mindset of these types of people is that when they go to these places that none of them ever really have the intention of coming back			0
' among those are @entity73 , 33 , who once worked as a bouncer for nightclubs in @entity78 's @entity77 district			0
now @entity8 authorities have identified him as a ' commander ' for the so - called militant group the @entity82 , which is causing havoc in @entity84 and @entity85			1
@entity73 , 33 , who once worked as a bouncer in @entity78 has been identified as a commander for the so - called militant group the @entity82 @entity73 's recruits include notorious jihadists @entity90 ( left ) and @entity91 ( right ) @entity73 is believed to have recruited as many as 30 @entity8 into the service of the group @entity43 has labelled a ' death cult '			2
among the fighters @entity96 has allegedly ' funnelled ' into @entity84 are notorious jihadists @entity91 and @entity90 , both from western @entity78			0
@entity90 was responsible for a gruesome image of his seven - year - old son wielding a decapitated head in august			2
mr @entity0 claims these type of recruits are lured ' on the basis they are going to some sort of utopian state , which of course it is not '			2
@entity110 , the @entity111 schoolgirl who followed @entity73 into the war zone and who was killed , along with her husband , during a battle with rival militants in @entity117 @entity73 is also thought by @entity8 officials to have been behind the recruitment of @entity111 private schoolgirl @entity110 and her husband @entity120 , who held dual @entity8 - @entity122 citizenship			1
both were killed in january during a battle with hard - line @entity126 militants			2
' the reality if that the furtherest thing from the mind of these people is to come back to something that is not that utopia they are looking for , ' the @entity15 founder added			0
mr @entity0 's life as a @entity137 representative has not been short on controversy , which includes a drawn - out defamation battle with a @entity78 radio station in the @entity141 and being the right - hand man of controversial cleric and former grand mufti @entity144			1
however , he was invited to meet with the prime minister and the attorney - general recently and came away from those talks doubting that the government really wants input from the @entity1 community on possible solutions			1
mr @entity0 's life as a @entity1 community representative has not been without controversy , including an eight - year defamation court battle and working alongside former grand mufti @entity144			1
@entity14 president @entity0 ( standing ) at a multi-faith function with controversial cleric and former grand mufti @entity144 ( second left ) and catholic bishop @entity160 ( far right ) he says there are scant details available of what the local community programs to eradicate home - grown terror groups look like , telling @entity167 that a draft report was handed out at the meeting and taken back			1
' we were handed a lengthy numbered draft report at the meeting regarding these counter-terror plans , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' we had barely any time to digest the details before it was taken back at the end of the same meeting			2
we ca n't tell you what those proposed community programs look like because we , the community leaders , have n't really been involved			2
' at a meeting of @entity1 leaders , @entity0 said : ' the reality is that the perception has now been created out there that these laws are aimed at @entity1 , despite what the politicians say			1
we had an argument with the @entity190 and the attorney - general about this issue			1
' he has taken issue with proposed new laws where it will be an offence to travel to a country declared by agencies as a terrorist zone without ' a legitimate purpose '			2
he says they no longer differentiate between those who leave to do humanitarian work and others who depart for more sinister reasons			0
' these laws , as we 've heard , now provide for the presumption of guilt ahead of innocence , ' he said			0
' no matter what label you want to give it , it is reversing the onus of proof			0
' there 's so many unanswered questions , like what is considered humanitarian work or an allowable pilgrimage and then be told it is plausible for an @entity8 to join the military of a country fighting another state over disputed territory ? ' if you are part of an army , we have seen what has taken place in @entity230 , and innocent people are killed , then these are war crimes			2
' we had an argument over this issue with the @entity190 and the attorney - general			1
the reality is that the perception has now been created out there that these laws are aimed at @entity1 , despite what the politicians say			1
' they should be used against all parts of the community , all religions and faiths			0
that 's not what most australians think , that 's the truth			0
' ' this is a fear of just a handful of individuals ' @entity0 has told government officials in meetings he hopes the local programs flagged by the government include backing for more mosques			1
'' this is what we face , the dynamics of our community is that we ca n't reach every single person , the established places of worship that we have just do n't have the resources to cater for everybody , ' mr @entity0 said			2
mr @entity0 says @entity8 's 500,000 strong @entity1 population is equally horrified by the violence wrought by the so - called @entity82 ' they have hijacked an ancient @entity7 symbol and it should not be in the hands of such a violent group which does not represent '			1
' but every time we want to establish another centre to reach out to more and more young people we face a lot of obstacles			0
it 's the air of suspicion we face on a regular basis			0
' a lot who have gone or have been talking about it , you look at their lifestyle their movements before they went			0
' all you have to do is look at them , what did they do before they went , were they upstanding citizens or were they people who had serious concerns and had difficulty adjusting to life here in @entity8 and contributing to society ? ' they are people who found it very very difficult to get accepted and belonging to @entity8			2
' there are about 500,000 people of muslim - background in @entity8 , representing 2.2 per cent of the population			2
mr @entity0 says they are equally horrified but what has transpired overseas and shattered that ' they ( @entity126 ) have hijacked an ancient @entity7 symbol and it should not be in the hands of such a violent group which does not represent '			1
' the problem with some of these young people is that they have this anger and suspicion , that they have been neglected			0
the community has not found a way to deliver services to them ' @entity0 says of @entity8 militants who have linked with terror groups overseas he believes there is only one , albeit small , window of opportunity for the return of radicals			1
' if they somehow see the light and view these groups at some point as un-islamic			0
' but that is very unlikely			0
once somebody has blood on their hands , it is very hard to make them see differently			0
' once they are in there they think they are an integral member of something which has a goal and an aim			0
' he says the first step is to stop them being marginalised			0
' the problem with some of these young people is that they have this anger and suspicion , that they have been neglected			0
the community has not found a way to deliver services to them , ' he said			0
' but this is a problem which is not too hard to fix			0
