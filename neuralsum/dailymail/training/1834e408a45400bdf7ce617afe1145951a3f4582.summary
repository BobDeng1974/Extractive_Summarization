but that was not the outcome for two newlyweds , after the groom tweeted @entity12 for champagne			1
happy honeymoon ! @entity15 and @entity16 are driven through @entity17 on a buggy with tin cans tied to the back the couple , known only as @entity15 and @entity16 , contacted the @entity23 airline as they prepared to fly out from @entity17 's @entity17 to @entity24			1
on his @entity26 feed , @entity15 had posted : ' hi @ @entity12 , is champagne available on your long - haul flights ? ' we want to start our honeymoon in style tomorrow morning ! ' to which the airline responded : ' @entity35 , we would like to see if we can assist you ! we ca n't promiss [ sic ] you anything , but where are you travelling tomorrow ? ' surprise ! the newlyweds seem to enjoy the ride at @entity17 , @entity41 how the plan came to be , after an innocent tweet from the husband at the airport , the happy couple were greeted by an enthusiastic member of @entity12 staff who congratulated them on their honeymoon and marriage , before directing them to their ' carriage '			1
she tells the couple , ' we have something amazing for you because you just got married , indicating to a buggy			0
with emotive music playing the background , the airline staff takes a photo of the couple as the couple settle in for their drive			2
the tin cans attached to the back of the buggy ensure no one is going to miss this journey not impressed : these two tourists seem less - than - amused by the couple 's ' carriage ' with an obvious , blue ' @entity79 ' sign and tin cans strapped to the back of the vehicle , the buggy motors through the busy airport , with passengers staring as it passes			1
finally , the jetsetters reach their destination and the trolley parks up as the airline staff tells them : ' have a very nice trip , enjoy your honeymoon , and if we can do anything else i 'm always happy to help			0
' the ' upgrade ' forms part of the @entity100 programme @entity12 has launched on @entity26			2
