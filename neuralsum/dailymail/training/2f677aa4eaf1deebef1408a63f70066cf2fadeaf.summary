by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 neuroscientist and computer genius @entity3 , 37 , has sold his company @entity6 to @entity8 for £ 242million a comprehensive school - educated computer genius has become a multi-millionaire overnight after selling his company to @entity8			1
neuroscientist @entity3 , 37 , co-founded @entity6 just two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans			1
his company has yet to produce anything commercially but @entity8 has still paid £ 242million for its expertise in the pioneering field of artificial intelligence			1
it represents @entity8 ’s biggest ever single acquisition in @entity22			1
mr @entity3 told @entity23 : ' we ’re really excited to be joining @entity8			2
' this partnership will allow us to turbo - charge our mission to harness the power of machine learning tools to tackle some of society ’s toughest problems , and help make our everyday lives more productive and enjoyable			1
' the website states @entity6 uses ‘ the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general - purpose learning algorithms			1
’ a friend of mr @entity3 said : ‘ he has very forward - looking ideas and can spot where industries are heading in the future			2
’ programmes that predict the way people think and can even teach computers to think for themselves are set to be the next big breakthrough in technology			0
it is believed @entity52 had been interested in buying @entity53 - based @entity6 , which employs 75 people , but @entity8 has now stolen a march on its rival			1
mr @entity3 grew up in @entity57 , north @entity53			2
at the age of four , he saw his father , a @entity61 - @entity60 entrepreneur , playing chess and asked to be taught the rules			0
within weeks , he was beating his father			0
a couple of years later he was programming computers			0
the acquisition by the @entity68 - based giant is the biggest single purchase in @entity22			1
@entity6 specialises in ' machine learning ' designing computers that can learn from their mistakes the acquisition of @entity6 is n’t @entity8 ’s first foray into artificial intelligence and machine learning			1
its most recent @entity77 search update was created to make @entity8 ' more human ' - searches can now understand context , like a human brain , for example			2
its @entity83 app uses ‘ predictive analysis ’ to predict what @entity85 users will do next , before offering relevant help and information at each step without ever being asked			0
@entity8 also hired futurist @entity91 as engineering director in 2012			2
@entity91 has famously claimed that in just over 30 years , humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity			2
he also claimed the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100			0
he took his a-levels early at just 15 and says his local comprehensive kept him on a ‘ light rein ’ which enabled him to develop his other interests			0
he went on to @entity106 where he graduated with a double first in computer science			0
mr @entity3 once said : ‘ when my parents saw that i was precocious in some areas , they simply encouraged me			0
in fact , they know nothing about computers			0
’ he set up @entity6 with two other entrepreneurs , @entity115 and @entity116			0
the business also counted @entity118 , the venture firm started by @entity52 backer @entity119 , as an investor			2
they will share in the £ 242million windfall			2
this latest acquisition follows @entity8 's recent purchase of seven robotics firms , including @entity126 , which makes humanoid robots , and @entity128 , which specialises in machines that can package goods and load up lorries , for example			1
however , instead of being used in the robotics division , it is more likely @entity6 , and its expertise , will be used to improve @entity8 's current technologies - including voice and text search			1
@entity8 's most recent @entity77 search update , for example , was created to make @entity8 ' more human ' and searches can now understand context , like a human brain			1
@entity6 's technology could help develop this further			0
@entity8 recently bought a series of robotic companies including @entity68 - based @entity148 , which makes humanoid robots , pictured			1
the firm is n't expected to make these technologies available to consumers but instead could use them to automate deliveries of goods reports claim @entity8 has also agreed to set up an ethics board to make sure the @entity159 technology is n’t ' abused ' , sources familiar with the plans told @entity161			1
@entity6 designs machine learning algorithms for retailers and gamers the @entity8 ethics board is set to create a series of rules and restrictions over the use of the technology			1
this is n’t @entity8 ’s first foray into artificial intelligence and machine learning			1
in addition to its @entity77 search update , the @entity83 app uses ' predictive analysis ' to predict what @entity85 users will do next , before offering relevant help and information at each step without ever being asked			0
@entity8 also hired futurist @entity91 as engineering director in 2012			0
