it is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel			2
symptoms include passing blood and unexplained changes in bowel habits , such as prolonged diarrhoea or constipation , as well as weight loss			0
approximately 72 per cent of bowel cancer cases develop in people aged 65 or older			2
bowel cancer can be treated using a combination of surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy			1
if bowel cancer is diagnosed in its earliest stages , the chance of surviving a further five years is 90 per cent , and a complete cure is usually possible			1
