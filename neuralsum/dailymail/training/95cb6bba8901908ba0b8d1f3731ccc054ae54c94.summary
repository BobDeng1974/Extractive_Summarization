@entity1 mp @entity0 said survivors of child abuse could be forced to take ‘ direct action ’ @entity6 ’s shambolic handling of the government ’s historic child abuse inquiry looks like a ‘ deliberate ’ attempt to stop victims getting to the truth , a @entity1 mp has claimed			1
@entity0 said survivors of abuse could be forced to take ‘ direct action ’ if the home secretary fails to get a grip			1
the remarks , which sparked a furious backlash , come after mrs may revealed that an independent panel set up to support the planned public inquiry could be disbanded			2
some victims ’ groups welcomed the move despite warnings it could delay the inquiry for ‘ yet more weeks and probably months ’			1
mr @entity0 said victims would be dismayed at the lack of progress in the probe , and could not help worrying that the litany of mistakes was party of a wider cover up			1
mrs may signalled a potential shift of approach last week when she told @entity35 that she wanted the wide - ranging inquiry - which is without a chairman following the resignation of two previous appointees - to be given extra powers			0
that could mean waiting for a chairman to be appointed for the inquiry panel , which would then be given statutory powers , or setting up a new inquiry panel under statutory terms			2
the third option of a @entity49 - which many prefer - would not have the powers of a statutory inquiry under the @entity53 and would be '' legally more risky ''			0
previous appointments as inquiry chairwomen , @entity55 and @entity56 , resigned following revelations over the connection to former conservative home secretary @entity59 , who has been accused of not following up accusations about a @entity62 child abuse ring in @entity63			1
in a letter to the panel members , reported by the investigative website @entity67 , mrs may said : ‘ i am currently considering these options and i appreciate this has implications for members of the panel			2
’ in a reply to mrs may obtained by @entity74 , panel member @entity74 , of the child safety group @entity76 , said : ‘ i , like other members of the panel , feel devastated at the prospect of the independent inquiry being halted as it has been made clear to us ' off the record ' that the panel will be stood down in the new year			1
’ but @entity83 , of the @entity84 for people abused in @entity86 , said if the inquiry does not have confidence of abuse survivors , it will be ‘ meaningless ’ and starting the process again should not be a ‘ huge trauma ’			1
‘ if indeed the decision has been made or is made to disband the panel as it is currently constituted , then i know that that would be supported by the vast majority of survivors or survivor organisations that we are in touch with , ’ he told the @entity94 4 today programme			2
‘ i have yet to encounter any survivors who have any faith in the process , or in the panel as it is currently constituted			1
‘ we need to have a transparent , open recruitment or a panel with appropriate skills and expertise , all done out in the open , nothing to do with nepotism or connections with people already in the establishment			2
‘ there are some very good people on that panel as it stands at the moment , but there are one or two characters who sadly have association with the past that would make them inappropriate			0
’ @entity1 said the home secretary @entity6 ' should be utterly ashamed of the process she has overseen ' mr @entity0 told today the situation is a ‘ mess ’			1
‘ what i suspect will happen , because we are not getting any satisfaction from @entity130 , because we are not moving forward and it has been six months now - documents going missing , chairmen having to stand down and resign , the @entity138 whitewash review into lost documents , terms of reference not being appropriate and now the panel being disbanded - i think that people will turn to more direct action and you can hardly blame them			2
‘ what you do need is a mixture of people on that panel who have a whole variety of experiences			0
i think the home secretary had got it broadly right in terms of the people that she appointed			1
‘ where she got it badly wrong is in terms of the process , the consultation with key stakeholders in this case the survivors of child abuse			1
’ mr @entity0 said he expected there would be ‘ more and bigger peaceful protests , more challenging of ministers , more challenging of the police to take action ’			1
‘ i have supported her ( mrs may ) on previous occasions ... but it is time and time again , and now this arrangement , ’ he said			0
‘ there is very little faith in @entity130 in terms of delivering this			0
‘ if @entity130 are set on doing this then it can be achieved			0
but you ca n't help thinking that they are not intent on getting this right			0
‘ there is a catalogue of mistakes that have been made , some of them fairly basic , and you ca n't blame the survivors of child abuse for wondering - because of the allegations of high - profile figures involved in the abuse - you ca n't help thinking that some of this is quite deliberate mistakes			1
‘ they do n't want to get to the truth , that would be the allegation			0
’ former children 's minister @entity197 said the independent panel should be allowed to get on with its work former children 's minister @entity197 said the inquiry would be set back by ‘ yet more weeks and probably months ’			1
‘ all of the survivors that i have seen on a one - to - one basis or as part of the @entity206 , have said ' look , we need to get on with this			0
we need this inquiry to get to the truth ' , ’ the @entity202 mp told today			0
‘ this panel is not perfect , but there are some very well - qualified , decent people on the panel			0
they have given up their time , they have started their work			0
‘ they have lost two chairmen , they have got on with their work ... ‘ so now to say “ look , sorry , but you are all going to be sent back home again ” , i think it is very unfortunate and rather disrespectful to the panel members			2
‘ it is just going to set the inquiry back yet more weeks and probably months			0
’ a @entity227 spokesman said : ‘ the home secretary is determined that appalling cases of child sexual abuse should be exposed so that perpetrators face justice and the vulnerable are protected			1
‘ she is absolutely committed to ensuring the @entity234 into @entity235 has the confidence of survivors			0
‘ the home secretary is also clear that we have to balance the need to make progress with the need to get this right			1
’ shadow home office minister @entity243 said : ‘ the home secretary should be utterly ashamed of the process she has overseen			1
‘ we are now in a position where there is no chair and no panel , while no work has been done on examining the horrible crimes of the past or into the flaws in the current child protections system			2
‘ @entity6 needs to take responsibility for the utter failure to get this vital work off the ground over such a long period			2
‘ this is not the first time inquiries have been held on difficult and sensitive issues			0
neither the @entity263 inquiry led by the @entity264 nor the @entity266 inquiry into child protection was mired in this chaos and confusion			0
‘ the home secretary has failed time and time again to set up an inquiry which commands the confidence of the public			1
’ over the weekend it emerged that @entity1 mp @entity276 has handed @entity277 a dossier including allegations about the involvement of 22 politicians - some of them apparently still serving - in paedophile rings			0
the names are said to include 14 ex-ministers .			0

@entity0 said victims dismayed at the lack of progress in the probe
comes after @entity6 proposed *scrapping* panel helping abuse probe
the home secretary 's move welcomed by some child abuse victim groups
ex children 's minister @entity197 said process will be delayed ' months '
mr @entity0 said catalogue of errors look like ' quite deliberate mistakes '
