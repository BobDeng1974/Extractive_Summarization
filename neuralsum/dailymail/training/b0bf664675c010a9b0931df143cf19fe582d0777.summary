at least half a dozen conservative cabinet ministers would opt for @entity2 to leave the @entity3 on the current terms of membership , senior party sources claim			1
the mood at the top of the party has hardened ahead of @entity10 ’s proposed negotiation of looser ties with @entity12 , followed by an in / out referendum by 2017 if he remains in power after the next election			0
three ministers – @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 – have suggested publicly that they would back an exit unless significant changes can be secured			1
at least three others are understood to be of a similar view			0
foreign secretary @entity17 , chief whip @entity18 and policy minister @entity19 have all uggested publicly that they would back an exit unless significant changes can be secured former environment secretary @entity26 yesterday insisted @entity2 should invoke the nuclear option of setting itself on course for an @entity3 exit			1
warning conservative mps who defect to @entity31 are ‘ stupid ’ , since they undermine the one party willing to ‘ sort out ’ @entity2 ’s relationship with @entity12 , mr @entity26 also called on mr @entity10 to develop ‘ robust ’ policies to win back disaffected @entity36 voters			1
the mp , who is emerging as a leader of the @entity39 having been sacked by the prime minister in the summer , suggested that the party ’s election manifesto should significantly harden its position on @entity44			0
in a speech in @entity46 , the former environment secretary suggested that @entity2 invokes @entity48 50 of the @entity49 signed by the last @entity51 government - the mechanism for an @entity3 exit			2
that would legally compel the @entity3 to negotiate the terms of @entity2 exit within two years - preventing the foot - dragging and obstruction in @entity12 that is otherwise likely as mr @entity10 seeks to negotiate looser ties			1
@entity10 has been reluctant to say that he would recommend an ‘ out ’ vote in the referendum if he does not get what he wants when trying to claw back powers mr @entity26 said he favoured a @entity64 - style agreement with the @entity3 that would allow the @entity2 access to the single market but remove it from the ‘ political project ’ in @entity12			1
it is not so much that we are leaving the @entity3 , as much as the political project of the @entity3 has left us , ’ he said			2
he insisted @entity2 had come to a ‘ fork in the road ’ in its relationship with the @entity3 , adding : ‘ to sort out the nightmare of the euro , they have got to form a cohesive , effective new state			2
‘ and meanwhile , we withdraw from the political arrangements and we concentrate on trade , which gives us an opportunity to get our seat back on the supra - national bodies which actually decide regulation affecting virtually every business in this country			0
’ mr @entity26 said a ‘ significant ’ number of conservative mps and the majority of activists would now favour an @entity3 exit unless significant changes can be achieved			1
but he insisted defecting to @entity31 was counterproductive			0
‘ it would be very unwise if any others do go , most unwise			0
what is clear is that if you defect you do n’t get the referendum , so if you are very keen on a referendum as a @entity36 backbencher you are very stupid to go and defect , ’ he said			2
mr @entity26 called on fellow eurosceptics to make a more compelling case for @entity2 ’s prospects outside the @entity3 - predicting that if an in / out referendum were held today , voters would choose to stay in			1
‘ voters have not been presented with a clear vision of what life outside the @entity3 would look like for the @entity2 and in the absence of any detail i am convinced that if an “ in - out ” referendum were held today , there would be a natural tendency to vote for the status quo , ’ he said			0
‘ the establishment view will be clearly to stay within the political organisation of the @entity3			0
‘ the answer to this is to invoke @entity48 of the @entity49			0
it is the only legally binding mechanism that we can use to require the rest of the @entity3 to enter formal negotiations with us , on setting out a new relationship , ’ mr @entity26 said			1
mr @entity26 said he favoured a @entity64 - style agreement with the @entity3 that would allow the @entity2 access to the single market but remove it from the ‘ political project ’ in @entity12 following the second @entity36 byelection defeat to @entity31 last week , mr @entity10 is facing calls from some @entity129 to toughen his position on a potential @entity2 exit from the @entity3			1
the prime minister will use a speech expected within the next ten days to flesh out details of his aim to limit the numbers of @entity3 migrants , get @entity2 out of the @entity3 ’s founding goal of ‘ ever closer union ’ and allow small groups of national parliaments to block unwanted @entity44 legislation			0
@entity144 sources were cool about mr @entity26 ’s proposal , pointing out using @entity48 would set @entity2 on course for exit , pre-empting the planned referendum			1
‘ the whole point is the @entity2 people should decide – not @entity152 or the government , ’ said one			0
unlike @entity51 , the @entity36 are committed to giving voters the choice in an in / out referendum on membership by the end of the 2017 after attempting to rengotiate a looser , more trade - based relationship for the @entity2 with the continent			2
but mr @entity10 has been reluctant to say that he would recommend an ‘ out ’ vote in the referendum if he does not get what he wants when trying to claw back powers			0
labour leader @entity165 reiterated that @entity2 would not leave the @entity3 if @entity51 wins may ’s election			2
he said : ‘ i ’m afraid the @entity36 , again today , are a party sleepwalking towards the exit door of the @entity3			1
’ he added that such a move would be ‘ bad for jobs , bad for investment , bad for businesses ’ .			0
