@entity26 's @entity2 ordered @entity6 , a part - time municipal judge , to step down if he wants to continue as a comedian ' the court can not ignore the distinct possibility that a person who has heard a routine founded on humor disparaging certain ethnic groups and religions will not be able to readily accept that the judge before whom he or she appears can maintain the objectivity and impartiality that must govern all municipal court proceedings			1
' a state ethics board recommended in 2008 that @entity6 quit his comedy work , expressing concern over his character depictions on the @entity51 reality show and the potential content of his sketches			0

an attorney for the state attorney general 's office , @entity110 , argued against @entity6 being allowed to hold both jobs , saying municipal judges represent the most frequent contact the public has with the justice system			0
some of the characters @entity6 has depicted could confuse the public and reflect badly on the judiciary , she argued			0
@entity6 , who is a member of the @entity119 and other professional performers ' unions , has said his entertainment work entitles him to health benefits and earns him more than his $ 13,000 - a - year part - time judge salary			1
