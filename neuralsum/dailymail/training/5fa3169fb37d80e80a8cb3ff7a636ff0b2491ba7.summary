@entity0 are one of my favourites to win the @entity4 , but i fear they ’ll suffer from fatigue			2
the players have been competing at the highest level in @entity8 — to the end of the @entity10 , the @entity11 and the @entity12 , which went to the wire with @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			0
the players are exhausted and repeating those performance levels against the best players in the world will not be easy			2
most of their build - up has been about recuperation and repair			0
running out of steam ? @entity0 's players might be tired after a gruelling season for their club sides @entity30 ’s coach @entity29 has already stated his intent by declaring @entity0 ’s quality is such that he will have to play with five across the back			1
@entity0 will need a more concentrated effort to break through and guard against @entity37 ’s counter-attack plans			0
some critics have questioned whether @entity0 are ageing , or on the wane , but i do n’t see that at all			0
my friend @entity42 has a squad that knows @entity0 ’s system			0
it means that , even if @entity49 or @entity50 grow tired , the likes of @entity47 or @entity48 know exactly what is required			1
i have the feeling that @entity47 , as he has already shown in @entity54 ’s colours , could be key to opening up more than one tight defence			0
i see @entity0 and @entity56 as the favourites , but it is difficult not to consider @entity59 , especially in @entity60			1
and , if they click , @entity61 — who have a lot of very talented players — will be the dark horses			1
statement of intent : @entity30 boss @entity29 ( left ) will play five across the back to nullify @entity0			1

@entity0 's players are exhausted after gruelling *domestic* seasons
@entity30 boss @entity29 will play five across the back to counter @entity0
if @entity49 or @entity50 are tired , @entity47 or @entity48 will come in
@entity56 and @entity59 also among favourites and @entity61 are dark horses
