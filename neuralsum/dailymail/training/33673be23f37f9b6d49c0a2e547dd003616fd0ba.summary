killer @entity8 had to demand an interview after officers refused to believe him when walked into a police station to admit to brutally torturing and murdering his neighbour five years earlier , it was said			1
last year , @entity8 , 31 , was sentenced to life , with a minimum of 28 years , for the savage killing of @entity16 at his home in @entity18 , south @entity19 , in march 2006			1
however , the details of his confession have only just been heard during an appeal to reduce his sentence			2
appeal : killer @entity8 , left , had his sentence for murdering neighbour @entity16 , right , cut by two years because he had ' solved his own crime ' the judge ruled that his sentence should be cut by two years after hearing @entity30 had ‘ put himself behind bars '			1
@entity31 , defending , told the court : ‘ the police thought he ( @entity30 ) was wasting their time			1
‘ he was allowed to smoke outside for an hour or two before coming back inside but was sent away twice			0
‘ he could have walked away			0
‘ it was his sheer persistence in demanding an interview which led to him taking the police down to where he had buried mr @entity16 some years earlier			2
’ lord justice @entity39 told the court that @entity30 had ‘ fallen into alcoholism ’ because of his guilt			2
the judge said : ‘ the confession suggests an acceptance by the appellant of what he has done			0
‘ it demonstrates a wish to come to terms with his own conscience and to be willing to pay the price that society requires			0
‘ there is no doubt at all that the confession in this case resulted in a conviction which never otherwise would have happened			0
confession : killer @entity8 walked into @entity63 , pictured , to demand officers arrest him for the brutal murder of his neighbour ‘ only the defendant knew the deceased was dead , only the defendant knew he had been killed and only the defendant knew where he was buried			1

after tying the dad - of - three up @entity74 then used a ‘ pressure point technique ’ he learned in the @entity2 to kill him before dumping his body in woodland in @entity78			0

the killer , who admitted manslaughter claiming he did n’t mean to kill his victim , then took police to a remote spot in woods near @entity93 , @entity78 , where he had buried his 60 - year - old victim ’s body in a shallow grave			0

but in a statement from the @entity103 released after @entity30 was found guilty of murder in december last year it made no reference to @entity74 being turned away from @entity63 police station			2
it stated : ‘ in march 2010 following his release from prison on other matters , @entity8 attended @entity63 police station and confessed to killing @entity16			1
’ following his arrest , the investigation was referred to the @entity118 and a murder investigation was launched			0
