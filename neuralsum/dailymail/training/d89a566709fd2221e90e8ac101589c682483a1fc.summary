when it comes to physical attributes , the women of @entity1 are happiest with their legs			1
those in @entity5 and @entity6 are particularly proud of their slender pins , with 61 per cent saying it was the body part they were most likely to flaunt			1
meanwhile , women in @entity11 are most likely to be getting their stomachs out beneath skimpy crop tops , and those in @entity15 wearing clothes that show off their bottoms , according to a survey			1
women all over the @entity20 say their legs are their best asset , with those in @entity5 and @entity6 most likely to of all to favour theirs on average , 47 per cent of @entity20 women said their legs were their best feature , compared to seven per cent who scored their stomach 's highest , according to the survey of 5,000 women by fashion site @entity30			1
but while @entity20 women were proudest of their legs at a national level , they were also unexpectedly pleased with their behinds			1
some 18 per cent of women polled said they dress to show off their bottoms : 42 per cent of women and 31 per cent in @entity37 named their bottoms their favourite feature			1
@entity39 is the @entity20 's bustiest city , with 39 per cent of the city 's women saying they had an ' ample ' bust , a whole 10 per cent above the national average of 29 per cent			2
of the 5,000 women surveyed by @entity30 , most were likely to dress to flaunt their legs the @entity47 capital of @entity48 boasted the nation 's flattest chests , with only 23 per cent of the city 's women putting themselves in the ' ample ' category			1
tummies were one area which most @entity20 women agreed it was best to put away			2
nationally , only seven per cent of women considered them a favoured feature , dipping to three per cent in @entity58			1
@entity11 , however , bucked this trend , where a startling 15 per cent of women admitted a penchant for midriff - baring			1
nationally , love handles were the feature most feared by @entity20 women , with 29 per cent of those questioned saying they dressed to conceal them			1
both @entity39 and @entity67 suffered from an above average ( 38 per cent ) fear of love handles , but @entity58 was the city where women most dreaded the muffin top at 44 per cent			0
@entity73 was the @entity20 's hottest spot for cankles , but even then only five per cent of women said they dressed to conceal them , compared to a tiny national average of two per cent			0
@entity73 is also officially @entity1 's capital of the backless dress : 29 per cent of @entity73 women declared their backs their best feature , almost double the national average of 14 per cent - and way ahead of @entity37 which languished at the bottom of the ' backs are beautiful ' league table at 8 per cent			2
second only to love handles in the ' put it away ' stakes , thighs were rated the least favourite feature of 28 per cent of women at a national level			2
problematic thighs were also something which preoccupied more women than usual in @entity98 ( 31 per cent ) and @entity37 ( 34 per cent )			0
the @entity20 city most likely to cover up its thighs was @entity48 , where 37 per cent of women said they dressed to conceal their upper legs - even if a greater proportion of local women were happy to show off their lower legs			2
@entity30 stylist @entity106 said : ' risqu√© plunging necklines and racy backless dresses are quite high maintenance and best reserved for special occasions whereas dressing those pins to maximum effect can easily be achieved by day or night			0
for our " legs eleven " nation , stylishly flaunting their best leggy assets is not just about rising hemlines			0
skinny jeans will do the trick and opaque or statement tights are a perfect alternative for those who would prefer not to adopt the @entity126 front - row fashion week trend of daring - to - go - bare			0
' ' whether you 're big - busted or more the bootylicious type , there 's always a way to make this season 's looks work for you ' @entity30 co-founder @entity133 concluded : ' @entity134 of @entity1 shows that when it comes to fashion , women have never been savvier			0
' whereas in decades gone by getting a few wise words on how to suit your wardrobe to your own body shape was an informal , hit - and - miss affair , award - winning style advice is never more than a few mouse clicks away			0
' it 's great to see women around the country putting style advice into practice in different ways			0
whether you 're big - busted or more the bootylicious type , there 's always a way to make this season 's looks work for you , and i 'm delighted to see fashion recommendation services like ours beginning to help women do just this			0
