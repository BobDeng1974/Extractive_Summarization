nine months ago the talk was of the @entity1 rebuffing an audacious takeover bid by the @entity3			1
now , with their vision of a global schedule as a viable alternative to the @entity8 behemoth having survived intact , the @entity1 is set to embark on the next phase in its development			1
i can reveal negotiations have reached an advanced stage with the pga of @entity15 for some sort of merger			1
whether this means an arrangement similar to that with the @entity21 in @entity22 — where seven events are co-sanctioned — or something more formal has yet to be determined			2
but it ’s surely good news for @entity1 members , who were given an outline of the plans at the @entity30 recently			1
if events with the prestige of the @entity34 , the @entity35 and the @entity36 made their way on to the schedule in december , it would be a significant upgrade on the slim offerings at the moment			2
the @entity34 , last won by @entity42 , could make its way onto the tour their schedule in december as well as here in @entity49 , there are events in @entity8 , @entity51 , @entity22 and the @entity52 that all count towards the race to @entity54 , seen here with 2014 winner @entity56 for their part , the @entity57 have the titles and golf courses but linking up with the @entity1 would surely help in terms of improving strength of fields and attracting sponsors			1
@entity15 is just about the only great golf playing region the @entity1 will not visit this year as part of its international schedule			1
as well as here in @entity49 , there are events in @entity8 , @entity51 , @entity22 and the @entity52 that all count towards the race to @entity54			2
the addition of some @entity15 events could act as a further incentive to follow the likes of @entity75 the two tours did co-sanction one event on the 2014 schedule in @entity79 but any merger this time is likely to encompass a number of tournaments			2
naturally , there will never be any serious competition between the @entity49 and @entity86 in terms of the size of prize funds			2
in @entity8 , they give away $ 1million - plus first prizes every week and there ’s no matching that			0
but to young @entity8 with ambition , the addition of some seriously good @entity15 events could act as a further incentive to follow the likes of @entity75 and the leading @entity49 and sign up to enjoy the best of both worlds			0
only @entity99 and @entity100 have ever won the same event on eight different occasions on the @entity3 , so you can only imagine how low the former must be feeling about his chipping yips to skip this week ’s @entity105 , where he has been such a serial champion			0
how cruel that his severe bout of stage fright now precludes him from even making it to the first tee			2
as for the masters and all those tight @entity112 lies , the question is rapidly changing from whether @entity99 ( right ) can make it to a sense of foreboding if he did			0
@entity99 has been out of action since the beginning of february when he withdrew midway through his first round at the @entity119 due to back pain quote of the week ‘ i ’m looking forward to getting there and seeing my grandad			0
it ’s going to be a great week			0
i ’m in the field on merit and playing well			0
’ it ’s taken a while but 27 - year - old @entity129 is slowly emerging from the shadow of his grandfather , the host this week at the @entity105			0
@entity129 has finished runner - up and tied 24th in his last two @entity3 starts and will compete in the event for the first time as a fully - fledged card holder , rather than on a sponsor ’s exemption			0
@entity129 acknowledges the crowd on the 18th green during the final round of the @entity143 on sunday @entity42 leading the @entity8 charge to crash @entity56 ’s date with destiny @entity42 makes no secret of the fact he ’s got @entity56 in his sights and , excitingly for the sport , he not only talks a good game but plays it as well			1
the 21 - year - old @entity152 displayed great skill and considerable resolve to prevail in a marvellous shootout against fellow @entity8 @entity75 and @entity156 to win the @entity143 in overtime in @entity158 on sunday			0
it was his third win in his last eight events , and he became just the fourth golfer aged 22 or under to have two victories to his name on the @entity3 in the last 70 years			0
@entity42 ( right ) achieved it in a manner that augurs well for his chances next month of going one better than his remarkable runner - up performance on his @entity170 debut last year			1
he got down in two from any number of unfavourable spots before holing a 28ft birdie putt to win on the third extra hole			0
@entity42 has @entity175 1 @entity56 in his sights following his @entity143 success ‘ @entity56 is the man who has picked up @entity99 ’s mantle and he is the one i am focused on , ’ said @entity42 , now up to a career - high sixth in the world			1
with the season ’s first major just three weeks away , the cream of this generation of @entity8 golfers have certainly laid down a marker , with the performances of @entity42 and @entity75 in this event following @entity188 ’s victory over current @entity189 champ @entity189 in @entity190 the previous sunday			1
now who should re-enter the fold at the @entity105 this week but @entity56 himself			1
this is his last scheduled tournament before his date with history at the masters			0
over to you , @entity56 .			1

@entity1 is set to embark on the next phase of development
negotiations have reached an advanced stage with the @entity57 for some sort of merger
@entity42 has @entity175 1 @entity56 in his sights
