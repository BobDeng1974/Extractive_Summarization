by @entity0 a government scientist cleaning out an old storage room at a research center near @entity4 made a startling discovery last week â€” decades - old vials of smallpox packed away and forgotten in a cardboard box			1
the six glass vials were intact and sealed , and scientists have yet to establish whether the virus is dead or alive , the @entity9 said tuesday			1
still , the find was disturbing because for decades after smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980 , world health authorities said the only known samples left were safely stored in super-secure laboratories in @entity18 and in @entity19			1
smallpox : this 1975 file electronmicrograph from the @entity9 shows the smallpox virus officials said this is the first time in the @entity25 that unaccounted - for smallpox has been discovered			1
at least one leading scientist raised the possibility that there are more such vials out there around the world			1
the @entity9 and the @entity34 are investigating			0
it was the second recent incident in which a @entity25 government health agency appeared to have mishandled a highly dangerous germ			0
last month , scores of @entity9 employees in @entity18 were feared exposed to anthrax because of a laboratory safety lapse			2
the @entity9 began giving them antibiotics as a precaution			0
the freeze - dried smallpox samples were found in a building at the @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 , that has been used by the @entity50 since 1972 , according to the @entity9			1
the scientist was cleaning out a cold room between two laboratories on july 1 when he made the discovery , @entity50 officials said			1
officials said labeling indicated the smallpox had been put in the vials in the 1950s			2
but they said it 's not clear how long the vials had been in the building , which did not open until the 1960s			2
no one has been infected , and no smallpox contamination was found in the building			1
smallpox can be deadly even after it is freeze - dried , but the virus usually has to be kept cold to remain alive and dangerous			1
in an interview tuesday , a @entity9 official said he believed the vials were stored for many years at room temperature , which would suggest the samples are dead			1
but @entity50 officials said later in the day that the smallpox was in cold storage for decades			1
' we do n't yet know if it 's live and infectious , ' said @entity77 , deputy director of the @entity9 center that handles highly dangerous infectious agents			0
the samples were rushed under @entity34 protection to the @entity9 in @entity18 for testing , which could take a few weeks			1
after that , they will be destroyed			0
@entity85 , deputy director of the @entity50 's @entity86 , said the discovery was unexpected but not a total shock			1
he added , however , that ' no one 's denying we should have done a better job cleaning out what was there			0
' in at least one other such episode , vials of smallpox were found at the bottom of a freezer in an @entity100 country in the 1990s , according to dr. @entity101 , a former @entity102 official who is now a professor at the @entity103			2
@entity101 said that when smallpox samples were gathered up for destruction decades ago , requests went out to ministers of health to collect all vials			1
investigation : the @entity9 , pictured , and the @entity34 are investigating the six vials of smallpox found in a storage room ' as far as i know , there was never a confirmation they had checked in with all groups who could have had the virus , ' he said			1
dr. @entity122 , who led the @entity102 smallpox - eradication effort and is now a professor at the @entity125 at the @entity126 , said it is highly unlikely more such stashes will be discovered			2
but he conceded " things were pretty casual " in the 1950s			0
decades ago , he recalled , ' i came back from many a trip carrying specimens , and i just put them in the refrigerator until i could get them to a laboratory			0
my wife did n't appreciate that			0
' @entity138 was one of the most lethal diseases in history			0
for centuries , it killed about one - third of the people it infected , and left most survivors with deep scars on their faces from the pus - filled lesions			2
the last known case was in @entity150 in 1978 , when a university photographer who worked above a lab handling smallpox died after being accidentally exposed to it through the ventilation system			0
global vaccination campaigns finally brought smallpox under control			0
after it was declared eradicated , all known remaining samples of live virus were stored at a @entity9 lab in @entity18 and at a @entity19 lab in @entity163 , @entity164			1
the labs take extreme precautions			0
scientists must undergo fingerprint or retinal scans to get inside , they wear full - body suits including gloves and goggles , and they shower with strong disinfectant before leaving the labs			2
there has long been debate over whether to destroy the stockpile			0
many scientists argue that any remaining samples pose a threat and that the deadly virus should be wiped off the planet altogether			2
others contend the samples are needed for research on better treatments and vaccines			0
at its recent annual meeting in may , @entity102 put off a decision again .			0
