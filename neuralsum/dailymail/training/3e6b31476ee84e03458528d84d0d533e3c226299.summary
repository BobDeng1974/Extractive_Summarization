author and relationship coach dr @entity11 - who is the first to admit she has her own chequered relationship history - discovered that by applying these principles she could finally make the right choices			1
do you always go for the wrong men but have the most perfect pet ? love expert dr @entity11 ( pictured ) says there are parallels between picking the perfect partner and the way you choose your dog			1
when @entity11 met @entity21 it was love at first sight : the big brown eyes , the irresistible looks , the knack he had of making her laugh			1
but sadly , he was n't a keeper			1
beneath that charming exterior lay some unsavoury habits and a difficult and a very demanding personality			1
@entity21 was the dog from hell			1
what @entity11 learned from that encounter set her on the path to becoming a women 's relationship coach			1
she learned her lesson , chose her second dog - and her current lovely partner - with a lot more care , and has since taught hundreds of women simple ways to spot the right man for them , using her pet as the template			1
now @entity11 shares ten of her tips with @entity49 readers , inspired by her new book , entitled do you choose your dog more carefully than your husband ? , which comes out on @entity54			1
temperament is king mean , moody , and magnificent may sound exciting â€¦ so , too , may the idea of taking on a challenge , or ' taming ' someone ' wild '			1
unfortunately , they lead to hard work relationships ; and hard work relationships lead to emotional exhaustion and breakdown			1
better to look for someone sunny and sweet - natured			1
think about the way a date projects himself on first meeting and beyond			1
why would pessimism or negativity be an aphrodisiac ? @entity73 towards waiters , children , and anyone outside the charmed circle of you and your date is a bad sign of things to come - same goes for dogs ! good manners are paramount 2			1
check the pedigree obviously , this is simpler with dogs than it is with people , and ca n't be settled on a first date			1
but then @entity91 was n't built in a day , and nor should relationships be			2
you can listen to the way they talk about parents , family members , and friends			2
if they come across as @entity101 - no - mates , there is cause for concern			2
beware yappiness unless you 're okay with saddling yourself with mr i 'm @entity107 , mr @entity108 , mr @entity109 with @entity110 , or mr @entity111 , be careful of over-talkers			2
@entity114 talking on a first date may be a sign of nerves , but also a lack of interest in the other person and a lack of social skills			2
they need to take an interest in you too ( this holds just as true for @entity127 , @entity128 )			2
asking non-intrusive questions is not rocket science			2
you want someone not just to have fun with , but someone who 's fun to be around 4			2
good manners this goes without saying			2
but it 's not limited to table manners			0
@entity73 towards waiters , children , and anyone outside the charmed circle of you and your date is a bad sign of things to come			1
selective good manners actually suggest that those manners are not deeply ingrained and may soon melt away			0
over-exuberance @entity152 does not mean keen			0
first date pushiness is the sign of someone who does n't respect boundaries and will end up pushing you into emotional corners			0
good behaviour many a woman who has overlooked a little first date leering - at other women - has lived to rue the day			0
you have standards for how you would dress and behave on a first date			0
your date should , too			0
if your date 's behaviour violates your standards in any way that 's a clear sign that you could be in for a rough ride			0
@entity173 you want your date to be sensitive and responsive to your wishes			0
choosing your meal for you , unasked , or making decisions for you without consulting you is a clear sign of wanting to be top dog			1
do you want to be reduced to playing @entity179 ? 8			0
playfulness you want someone not just to have fun with , but someone who 's fun to be around			0
that does n't necessarily mean someone who acts like a kid - what long - term kids are actually looking for is second mummies			0
you want someone who you feel comfortable enough around to be silly with			0
beware rogue breeders if you 've been single for a while , friends may take it upon themselves to set you up with ' lovely dates '			0
just because they find that date ' lovely ' in the context in which they know them does n't mean you will			0
you would n't buy a house just on the say - so of mrs @entity201 three doors down			0
you always have to do your own due diligence			0
leave the paperwork at home women are terrible at playing ' @entity208 ' - they go on a first date and , provided the man is n't an obvious freak or psychopathic monster , they get busy imagining their future life with that person			0
a first date is not designed to be a marriage contract. , it 's simply the start of getting to know another person			0
if you find yourself fantasising about that happy future , take a cold shower , or speak to a grounded friend .			0
