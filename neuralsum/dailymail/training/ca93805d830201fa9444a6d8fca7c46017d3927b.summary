these include an ability to sense blood circulation , balance , compass direction , temperature , gravity as well as an ' awareness of importance , unimportance			0

' the group broke ground on the @entity97 - style building in 1998 , but stopped work after finishing the shell			1
for three years , the group ceased construction on the project until the city started imposing $ 250 - a - day fines for code violations			2
scientology defectors have explained that the building 's slow construction is due to church leader 's who have used the project as a fundraising cash cow			2

former @entity21 couple @entity117 and @entity118 of @entity119 , @entity116 contributed more than $ 340,000 to the construction of the @entity6 , before ultimately suing the church in federal court for dragging out the project ' as a shill '			1
church representatives have described the @entity118 's suit as ' frivolous '			0
while the new building is part of a larger complex of buildings that serve as a spiritual retreat for @entity14 , there will be space on the ground floor for visitors to learn about the religion			2
