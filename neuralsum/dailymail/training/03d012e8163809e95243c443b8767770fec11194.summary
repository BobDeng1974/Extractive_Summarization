expert pundit @entity9 had been commentating on @entity11 's match against @entity12 on saturday evening when @entity2 cameras panned to a fan dressed completely in a tight black suit			1
as the fan appeared on screen , veteran pundit @entity9 joked that the black - costumed spectator looked like @entity19 ' the @entity20 , a black swimmer who shot to fame at the @entity22 in 2000			1
@entity9 had joked : ' that @entity19 , is n't it , sitting at the front ? ' as the fan appeared on screen , before @entity2 cameras cut back to the action			2
one user posted soon after the comment : ' the " eric the eel " comment was particularly crass , even by his usual inane standards			0
' ill - judged : @entity9 claimed the remark was a reference to the lycra suits @entity19 himself used to wear , but many @entity32 users took the comment differently another poster on @entity32 said : ' i still ca n’t get over @entity55 ’s ‘ @entity19 ’ comment			1
