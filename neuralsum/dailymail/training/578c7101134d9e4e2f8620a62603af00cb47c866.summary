when they married to great fanfare and with much opulence in an @entity4 castle in november 2006 , talk not only centered on bride @entity6 ' wedding dress but also on her prenuptial agreement with the groom			1
the details ? for each year the couple stay married , the @entity11 actress collects $ 3million - to a maximum of $ 33 million after 11 years - as well as their palatial home in @entity16			1
if their marriage had lasted more than 11 years , @entity6 would have received half of @entity21 ’s reportedly $ 250 million fortune			2
after filing for divorce less than six years later , according to the agreement , @entity6 should only be entitled to $ 15 million as well as the couple 's $ 35 million @entity24			1
split : after five years of marriage , @entity27 and @entity6 are set to engage in a messy divorce with speculation as to how much of the @entity27 estate @entity6 is entitled to autos : the $ 1.5million @entity33 - which the couple arrived to the @entity36 premiere in - features a 16 cylinder engine , the engine is fed by four turbochargers and displaces 7,993 cubic centimeters but with an estate worth upwards of $ 275 million , @entity6 is expected to seek much more and there is already intense speculation as to how much she will collect when the papers are signed			1
because the couple lived in @entity24 , @entity16 law will be applied to the separation of assets			2
@entity16 is a community property state , so normally a couple 's assets must be split evenly in divorce			1
any money earned would be split 50/50 as would any debt either @entity27 or @entity6 incurred during their marriage			2
but the prenuptial agreement signed before they tied the knot in 2006 will change all that			1
source : @entity60 sources reveal the 33 - year - old is asking for a ' suitable amount ' of child support , as well as a division of property , though no mention was made of the prenuptial agreement in divorce papers			1
after @entity6 's lawyer announced her client was filing for divorce , representatives for @entity27 , 49 , released a statement saying he was ' very sad ' and ' did not see this coming '			2
since they did not stay married for 11 years , the prenuptial agreement explicitly states that @entity16 community property laws wo n't apply to the divorce - which normally sees a couple 's assets split 50/50			1
when the divorce is eventually finalized , each will keep their respective earnings from the projects they 've worked on since november 2006			0
that 's in addition to the $ 3 million per year @entity27 will give to @entity6			1
there were also rumors that a certain degree of ' nastiness ' was involved , evidenced by @entity6 's intent to seek sole custody of @entity91			2
if she succeeds in this , the child support payments @entity27 will have to pay for his daughter could prove sizeable			0
@entity97 divorce attorney @entity96 told @entity98 that because of the prenup , @entity6 stands to lose millions and will need to use their six - year - old daughter as a pawn to get more money			0
' most of the estate is @entity106			0
she ’ll have to go for a lot of child support , ' she said			0
' she ’ll have to show that @entity91 has nannies , cars , activities , clothes , hair appointments			0
that a hefty amount each month is needed to maintain @entity91 ’s lifestyle			0
' home number one : @entity27 and @entity6 paid about $ 35 million for this @entity24 mansion sprawled over 10,286 square feet which @entity6 is said to be entitled to in the prenuptial agreement their country house in @entity122 , @entity123 : the home features six bedrooms , an indoor swimming pool , underground garage , a sports pavilion , a game room , greenhouse , high tech security system and a staff cottage is worth $ 4.75million part - time homes : a $ 7million villa in @entity4 's @entity135 , left , and a luxury @entity137 apartment add to the couple 's multimillion dollar estate @entity141 have today reported that @entity6 filed divorce documents in @entity97 because the courts look on sole custody more favourably than in @entity16			1
but sources told the gossip site that @entity27 is trying to avoid ties with the city because of the high tax rates and he does n't want to let on that he and @entity6 have been living there			0
@entity141 however , claims it has obtained documents which show that @entity27 deeded their @entity137 apartment to @entity6 last august specifically for tax purposes and she is using the apartment to establish residency in @entity97 for the purpose of the divorce			0
shortly after they married in 2006 , the couple paid $ 30million for a lavish nine - bedroom home on a @entity162 , @entity163 , estate which they were later rumored to have added a $ 10 million bunker to			0
they also own a lavish apartment in @entity97 's @entity137 , where @entity6 is currently said to be holed up with the couple 's daughter @entity91 , while @entity27 films his new movie @entity170 in @entity174			1
