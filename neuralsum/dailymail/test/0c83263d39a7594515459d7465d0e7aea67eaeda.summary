anyone who has witnessed a game of hockey or netball might disagree , but men really are more competitive than women , according to a new study			1
researchers have discovered that male athletes are more driven by the desire to beat the competition than female athletes			0
sportswomen tend to be more committed to aspects of their lives outside sport - such as their academic studies - than their male counterparts , the researchers say			1
the researchers found that male 5,000 metre runners are more competitive than women			1
@entity20 's @entity19 is pictured above running to victory in the @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 this may explain why boys are often seen as being more competitive			0
however , the researchers say that there can be a great deal of individual variability with some women actually showing greater competitive drive than most male athletes			1
many reasons have been suggested to explain why women remain poorly represented in senior positions at large companies			0
now , a new study may shed light on workplace dynamics , by claiming that while men enjoy competition in the office , women like to be part of a team			2
the results suggest than men have a dimmer view of their colleagues ’ ability than women and were therefore more keen on competing to be rewarded for their own work , rather than that of a team ’s			2
researchers from @entity55 in @entity56 and the @entity57 , analysed the behaviour of both sexes when the study participants were asked to choose between being paid on their individual performance or as part of a team			0
they found that less than 11 per cent of men opted for team payment , in comparison to 44 per cent of women			1
these individuals tend to be far less common in women 's sport , they said			2
the study could have implications for other areas outside sport , such as in the workplace where greater gender diversity could bring advantages			0
professor @entity76 , a psychologist at @entity77 in @entity78 , said they studied elite runners because it is a sport that is equally popular among men and women and there is no disparity in prize money			1
he said : ' of course , we need to be careful not to assume that our running results will generalise to all sports or all domains outside of sports			0
' nevertheless , our findings do echo those from other studies , which show that even when men and women hold the same selective jobs , men are more likely to prioritize competing for recognition and status , while women have more communal orientations			1
' the researchers , whose study is published in the journal @entity103 , assessed the competitiveness of 1,147 long distance runners competing in the 5,000 metres in the @entity107 @entity106			0
they surveyed each runners motivation for participating , their training volume and their desire to compete at an elite level after college			2
@entity107 tennis player @entity113 ( above ) was notorious for letting his competitiveness get the better of him the study found that male long distance runners , like @entity19 ( left ) , are more competitive than women , but there are some women , like @entity120 on the right , who are arguably more competitive than the men they also compared runners who were competing @entity106 's @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			1
the researchers found that men were far more competitive at all levels than female runners			1
the sex difference in competitiveness was also just as large in the fastest runners in @entity124 compared to the slower ones in @entity126			0
professor @entity76 said : ' by social science standards , the difference we found - men and women differing by about half a standard deviation on competitiveness measures - is moderate to large			2
' but this kind of a difference still means that many of the female runners are more competitive than many of the male runners			0
' writing in the journal the researchers added : ' women did report greater commitment than men to their academic studies , suggesting a sex difference in priorities			1
' therefore , policies aiming to provide men and women with equal opportunities to flourish should acknowledge that sex differences in some kinds of preferences and motivation may persist even in selective sub-populations			0
' @entity166 is known for her intensely competitive attitude , playing through injury and destroying raquets			0

scientists at @entity77 , @entity78 , studied elite runners
they found the men tended to have greater competitive drive than women
women tend to prioritise other aspects of their lives like academic studies
