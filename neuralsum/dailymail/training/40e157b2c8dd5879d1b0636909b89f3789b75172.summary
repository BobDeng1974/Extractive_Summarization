by @entity0 campaign groups are furious about a ' sexist ' cartoon posted on a police @entity4 account which shows a man gagging his wife with a seatbelt			1
the tweet , which shows a female car passenger gagged and bound to her chair as a male driver looks on smugly , was yesterday uploaded by a police officer			1
above the cartoon a banner read : ' @entity16 design : 45 % less car accidents ! ! ' it was also captioned by the officer : ' a car designer has won an award for designing a seatbelt which helps to cut down on vehicle noise pollution # @entity23			2
' the officer who tweeted the ' sexist ' cartoon is now being investigated by the force 's @entity27 after it was found to have been in breach of the organisation 's social media policy @entity32 has now released a full statement apologising for ' any offence caused by this inappropriate use of one of our accounts '			1
the officer in question is also being investigated by the force ’s @entity27			1
the incident provoked a barrage of complaints on the social networking site , with criticism from people based all over the @entity48 and as far as @entity49 in @entity50			0
chief executive of national domestic violence charity refuge , @entity53 , criticised the force ’s ' derogatory attitudes to women '			0
' i am disappointed that @entity32 tweeted this sexist image - and then tried to pass it off as a bit of " humour "			2
' did the police officer who tweeted this image really think that women would laugh at this offensive sexist stereotype ? female members of the public deserve respect , not ridicule			1
' it is deeply disturbing that some police officers in @entity70 seem to possess such derogatory attitudes towards women			2
' @entity73 , @entity74 mp for @entity77 ’s @entity76 constituency , added : ' the police are responsible for helping to hold to account those who perpetrate domestic violence			2
' the fact that they have posted online a so - called joke which minimises the seriousness of this crime is both insulting and worrying			0
' if individuals within the police force do n’t understand that it is not a laughing matter and ensure that they take domestic violence seriously then who will ? ' online campaign group @entity92 confirmed the post will be appearing on its weekly updates of online sexist abuse			1
a spokesperson said : ' we see high volumes of misogyny and abuse here at @entity101 and very often such comments , many of which promote domestic and sexual violence , are made under the guise of so - called humour			0
@entity109 police received a furious backlash on @entity4 after the officer posted the cartoon - which was in clear breach of the force 's social media policy inspector @entity116 , based at the nearby @entity118 police station ( pictured ) , said the cartoon which depicted the passenger in the car being gagged , was ' sexist and offensive ' and in breach of police policy ' it is however , extremely worrying to see a police account with nearly 1,000 followers ... tweet out such an endorsement of violence against women			1
' inspector @entity116 , from @entity131 , said : ' an officer working on one of our neighbourhood accounts has tweeted a sexist and offensive picture which clearly breaches the force ’s social media policy			0
' this was an inappropriate tweet , made by one member of staff , and it in no way reflects the views of the force			0
' social media can be an excellent way of communicating with local people and we trust our staff to tweet appropriately and sensibly , actively encouraging them to be engaging and friendly in their posts			0
' however , occasionally mistakes are made and we apologise for any offence caused by this inappropriate use of one of our accounts			0
