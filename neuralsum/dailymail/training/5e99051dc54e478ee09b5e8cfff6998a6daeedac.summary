the pattern is set , the trend well established			2
the world , in the complex mind of @entity3 , has turned against @entity6 ’s manager and he would n’t have it any other way			1
why would he , when this was the plan all along ? just as winning has been a theme of his career , so has the carefully - crafted tantrum			2
he will moan , defend the indefensible and attack the likes of @entity17 columnist @entity16 who , in the case of @entity19 this week , say what the rest are thinking			1
some will call it a character flaw ; others will recognise that it is a staple of his management			2
a master tactician he may be , but he is also a master of manipulation , of finding a way into the minds of his players and giving them extra incentives to fight			0
in football , siege mentality is the cliche that best sums it up			1
@entity19 and @entity39 square up to one another during @entity6 's @entity40 semi-final @entity42 raises a finger to @entity19 - the striker has been banned for stamping on @entity45 @entity46 and @entity3 came to blows on the @entity49 touchline earlier this season the @entity51 manager and his @entity6 counterpart squared up during the @entity54 ' 2 - 0 victory in october @entity3 ( right ) prepares his team to face @entity56 during @entity6 training on thursday it is a ploy used throughout his career , often at critical points in the season			1
in this campaign he has spoken of ‘ campaigns ’ against @entity6			1
he has reacted furiously against suggestions that his players dive – anyone who watched their recent win against @entity69 might see through the argument – and now , he 's incredulous at the criticisms aimed at @entity19 for stamping on @entity72 ’s @entity45			1
@entity19 has been charged and banned by the @entity73 for three games for the incident			1
as a man equipped with two functioning eyes , @entity3 will not be blind to what @entity19 did			1
as a man whose side face @entity56 in a huge game this weekend , he will also not be blind to the benefits of a dressing room that feels it ’s ‘ us against the world ’			1
it ’s not a new trick , but it works			0
@entity89 , who played for @entity6 between 1990 and 1998 , said this week : ‘ @entity3 is a master of mind games , and the one thing he likes to have within his group is a siege mentality			1
he has always been like that and gets his group of players behind him , and makes sure they are all pushing in the right direction			0
@entity99 ( right ) appears to stamp on @entity45 - an act that landed him a three - game ban ' when he has a press conference , he protects his players and that shows he is 100 per cent behind them and wants the players to be the same with him			0
when you speak to the players , that is the spirit they have got			0
' it is something that has recurred throughout @entity3 ’s career , and here are a select few instances : @entity6 - part one it is part of the @entity3 method to claim his side face unfair obstacles , usually with the subsequent support of a prominent player			1
in 2005 , after a goalless first leg of the @entity40 semi-final against @entity120 , @entity3 said : ‘ sir @entity121 ( @entity121 ) was very clever , if you can say that , at half - time by putting some pressure on the ref. in the second half it was whistle and whistle , fault and fault , cheat and cheat			1
’ @entity131 and @entity132 contend for the ball during @entity6 's 0 - 0 tie with @entity120 @entity3 accused @entity120 manager sir @entity121 of putting the officials under pressure @entity137 backed up his point of view , before @entity6 went on to win the tie and then the trophy			1
later that year , @entity3 would accuse referee @entity141 of inviting @entity143 manager @entity142 into his room at half - time of their @entity147 last - 16 tie			1
@entity6 lost the first leg before winning the second and progressing , but in the bitter fallout , which included death threats , @entity141 quit the game			1
@entity154 and @entity155 exchange words during @entity6 's ill - tempered tie against @entity143 @entity141 quit the game following the bitter fallout of @entity6 's first - leg defeat in @entity143 the @entity160 's @entity159 , a mental performance coach , said last month : ‘ whether it 's consciously calculated , which is a strong possibility , or whether it 's an emotional response , which is also a strong possibility , @entity3 has , time and time again , shown a siege mentality with his teams , by creating common enemies ‘ if you make yourself out to be a victim in a situation , if you 've got loyalty in your team , which he does , it just creates a stronger bond			1
’ @entity176 @entity3 enjoyed great success at @entity176 and most notably won his second @entity147 trophy			1
despite enjoying huge resources while he was in @entity180 , he would identify his side ’s relative lack of media support as an unfair disadvantage in @entity176 ’s battles with @entity186 and @entity187			1
in april 2009 , with @entity176 seven points clear of @entity187 and nine matches remaining , he said : ‘ we have the @entity191 with its 45,000 subscribers , @entity187 have @entity193 and @entity186 have three tv stations and the newspapers			2
i feel a bit like @entity197			0
’ not surprisingly , the claims came at a time when @entity176 were in the middle of a defensive crisis			2
while @entity3 has certainly never been afraid to draw battle lines between himself and a rival manager or officials , the media appears to be a favoured target , particularly when making the point that his sides are treated unfairly			1
@entity3 , pictured giving @entity210 instructions , enjoyed great success during his spell at @entity176 the @entity212 holds the @entity147 aloft after his @entity176 side beat @entity214 in the 2010 final take these comments from 2009 : ‘ there has been the greatest amount of intellectual manipulation			1
there was a concerted , organised effort to manipulate public opinion			0
‘ it was fantastic work but it is unrelated to my world – i work in football			0
i do n’t like intellectual prostitution , i like honesty			0
‘ over the last few days nobody has mentioned that @entity231 have great players but will end the season without a title			0
nobody has mentioned that @entity186 have 11 fewer points than us and will end the season without a title			0
‘ nobody has spoken about @entity187 , who have won so many points thanks to refereeing mistakes			0
‘ every time i turn on the tv i see @entity246 ( the then @entity231 manager ) , who is everyone ’s friend , but i do n’t like prime - time television			0
i do n’t know whether these people pay to be interviewed			0
i know that they offer me money for interviews and i refuse because i do n’t manipulate reality			0
’ @entity253 perhaps at no other point in his career has @entity3 made bigger claims of unfair treatment			1
at one stage he suggested there was a plot to get @entity143 and @entity261 to the @entity147 final ahead of @entity253			2
that flashpoint came after a bad - tempered 2 - 0 win for @entity143 in the first leg of the 2011 semi-final			0
@entity3 said : ‘ i do n't know if it is the @entity261 sponsorship or if it is because they are nice guys			2
‘ congratulations to @entity143 on being a great team and congratulations for all the other stuff you have which must be very hard to achieve			0
they have power and we have no chance			0
’ @entity143 players surround referee @entity279 during an ill - tempered semi-final against @entity253 @entity281 pictured celebrating against @entity253 after scoring for @entity143 at the @entity282 in 2011 @entity3 tries to confront @entity143 players following his side 's second - leg @entity284 match against @entity253 @entity3 also said : ‘ @entity286 is a fantastic coach but i have won two champions @entity287			1
he has won one @entity147 and that is one that would embarrass me			0
‘ i would be ashamed to have won it with the scandal of @entity49 and if he wins it this year it will be with the scandal of the @entity282			0
i hope one day @entity286 has the chance of winning a proper @entity147 , a brilliant , clean championship with no scandal			0
’ @entity143 went on to win the @entity147 and @entity299 supported his manager by calling the @entity302 ‘ cry babies ’			0
@entity6 - part two the @entity303 has slowly reverted to type			2
last season he claimed @entity6 were shown a lack of respect in the scheduling of their match with @entity72 , when a champions league semi-final was in close proximity			2
he said : ‘ in the last 10 years , @entity6 was the most important club in this country , defending this country in @entity315 competitions			2
it 's the last club to be @entity315 champion , it 's the last club to win the @entity318 , it 's the club with the record of presence in semi-finals and @entity6 fans think @entity6 deserves more respect than @entity6 is getting			1
’ @entity3 holds the ball as @entity72 captain @entity39 attempts to retrieve it this season he has claimed there was a ‘ conspiracy ’ against his side after @entity330 was booked - incorrectly – for diving against @entity332			2
he has also claimed more recently of a campaign against @entity6 and defended a striker who apparently stamped on another professional			2
he has since cancelled friday ’s press conference			0
great theatre , but it ’s the same old story .			0

@entity6 axed @entity3 's *pre-match* @entity56 media *session*
@entity54 boss is incensed after @entity19 was banned for three games
@entity3 is creating siege mentality at @entity6 but we 've been here before
it it something that has recurred throughout his career during spells with @entity253 , @entity176 , and , of course , in both spells with @entity6
