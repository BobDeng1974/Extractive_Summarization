retired electrician , @entity14 , 71 , has received £ 187,000 in compensation because his wife died of mesothelioma after being exposed to asbestos on his overalls mr @entity14 , 71 , secured the payment after the case went to the @entity21			1
he said : ‘ it is nice [ to have the money ] but you ca n't put a value on someone 's life			0
