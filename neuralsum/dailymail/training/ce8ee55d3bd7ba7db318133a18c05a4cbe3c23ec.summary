by @entity1 reporter published : 15:18 est , 22 july 2012 updated : 15:20 est , 22 july 2012 a struggling clothes store has made a bold marketing move in an attempt to boost sales - by offering an 80 % discount for shoppers who make purchases in their underwear			1
the @entity10 in @entity11 tempted clients with savings of up to 80 per cent - but only if they took their clothes off			1
the store , which sells clothes , perfumes and electrical products , made a normal month ’s takings in just a few hours as over 100 men and women stripped off to shop			2
naked ambition : the @entity11 store offered a huge discount as long as customers turned up in underwear , similar to this promotion in @entity29 alst year as a result the promotion , which was expected to last an hour , was extended for the whole of the day on saturday			1
@entity32 , sales manager of the shop in @entity34 on the border with @entity36 , told @entity11 ’s @entity38 newspaper that sales had plummeted after @entity36 recently tightened customs controls			1
he said : ' it was either come up with something creative or go bust			0
at first we wanted people to go completely naked but realised i could have got into trouble with the law			0
' it was a great success			0
we had people in their underwear taking advantage of the promotion , and lots more coming in to get an eyeful			0
' i ’ve never seen the shop so full			2
we ’re already planning our next one			0
' the concept of offering customers discounted items for turning up without clothes is not a new idea in the retail world			0
earlier this year , @entity29 retailer @entity64 offered customers free clothes if they turned up at their @entity67 store in just their underwear .			1
