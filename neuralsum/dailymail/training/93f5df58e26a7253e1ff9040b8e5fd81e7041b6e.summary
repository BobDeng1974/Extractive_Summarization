by @entity0 for @entity1 four - year - old @entity2 has become the youngest person ever to sample the $ 295 nine - course tasting menu at world - renowned restaurant @entity7 - and her verdict is in			1
@entity2 spent over five hours at chef @entity11 's triple @entity10 star eatery , located in @entity13 's @entity12 ; where she was served everything from caviar and butter - poached lobster to ' hen egg custard ' and truffled gnocchi , as @entity19 took notes on her opinions			1
the summer melon soup was held in particular high regard for tasting like ' @entity24 ' , but the edible flowers were puzzling for @entity2 , and upon assessing the @entity26 , she piped up : ' at least it ’s a salad , but it ’s not very much salad			1
' where 's the rest of it ? four - year - old @entity2 reviewed the nine - course tasting menu at @entity7 , a @entity13 restaurant with three @entity10 stars , widely hailed as being ' the best restaurant in the world ' the @entity38 laundry has been hailed by celebrity chef and food critic @entity40 as ' the best restaurant in the world , period ' - and crucially for @entity2 , has ' the most elegant bathroom i 've ever seen			1
' established in 1978 , it serves two different nine - course tasting menus daily ; none of which uses the same ingredient twice			1
the fixed price is $ 295 before tipping , and wine pairing costs an extra $ 250 ; although in this case it was ginger ale served in a champagne glass , which @entity2 was ' obsessed ' with			1
' is this a flower ? to eat ? eww			0
i 'm gon na give it some water ' @entity2 's first dish - an amuse - bouche consisting of ' avocado and lime crème fraîche wrapped in a sesame - seed tuile ' - looked deceptively like an ice cream cone ; which happens to be @entity2 's favorite food ( as long as it 's a ' hard cone ' )			1
' i like the white part better than the green part , ' she surmised , after she had recovered from the crippling disappointment of the ice cream no - show			2
mixed feelings : the soup was held in high regard for tasting like ' @entity24 ' , but @entity2 was disappointed when an amuse - bouche which looked like an ice cream turned out to be an avocado wrap after the summer melon soup - which was green , thus perhaps the @entity84 reference - @entity2 was served two fishy dishes ; the restaurant 's notoriously decadent ' oysters and pearls ' caviar plate , and the ' citrus - cured pacific yellowtail			1
' @entity2 obstinately refused to try either of them , because they looked to be ' really not good			1
' ' it looks like the house that bees live in			0
and i hate bees ! ' next up was the ' hen egg custard , ' which was served in an egg shell with its top sawn - off and filled with a ' ragoût of périgord truffles			2
' @entity2 was deeply suspicious about the authenticity of the egg , theorizing that it is simply impossible to take off the top of a real shell without cracking it			2
once she 'd forgiven the chef his blatant lie , she loved this course , and concluded that the chicken was like a ' fluffy marshmallow ' and the feather tasted like a ' potato chip			0
' it should be noted that neither chicken nor feather were present in this meal			0
swanky : established in 1978 , @entity7 serves two different nine - course tasting menus daily ; none of which uses the same ingredient twice what are you misleading me ? @entity2 was deeply suspicious about the authenticity of this egg , theorizing that it is simply impossible to take off the top of a real shell without cracking it the following meaty charcuterie board was eschewed in favor of the accompanying bread , which she gobbled up with great relish before demanding seconds			1
as for the pretentiously small salad , @entity2 insisted that the peppers ' taste like babies ' , and that the edible flower was downright bonkers			2
' is this a flower ? to eat ? eww			0
' i 'm gon na give it some water , ' she said with some concern , before instead chopping it up into pieces on the tablecloth			0
excellent taste : @entity2 was ' obsessed ' with the ginger ale ( pictured ) and she also loved the shaved truffles , which she referred to fondly as ' black diamonds			2
' her only suggestion to the chef was that they would be better if they were pink thrillingly , the next course consisted of more bread ; this time served with ' molded butter			0
' it looks like the house that bees live in			0
and i hate bees ! ' she exclaimed			0
there was another argument regarding the following dish , the ' sweet butter - poached maine lobster with black mission fig jam ' , which @entity2 maintained was in fact shrimp			1
the shaved truffles on the ' russet potato gnocchi ' were a delight for the four - year - old critic with surprisingly sophisticated taste , likened fondly to ' black diamonds			2
' her only suggestion to the chef was that they would be even better if they were pink			0
impressive notes of chocolate : the rich assortment of desserts went down a treat with @entity2 , providing a sugary ending to a roller - coaster of culinary first 's for the adorable tot spoiled for life : when @entity2 's mother suggested they head out for a good old - fashioned pizza next time , she demanded they go back to the @entity38 laundry instead the ' herb roasted elysian fields farm lamb ' was branded ' not delicious ' and the subsequent ' cabot clothbound cheddar ' , though it claimed to be served with ' garden broccoli ' , was accused by @entity2 of being yet another dishonesty			1
' i do n't see any broccoli			0
it 's just a square with other stuff ! ' she proclaimed			0
' i do n't see any broccoli			0
it 's just a square with other stuff ! ' the rich assortment of desserts went down a treat with @entity2 ; providing a sugary ending to a roller - coaster of culinary first 's for the adorable tot			1
her mother , however , may now have a bit of a problem on her hands			0
when she suggested to @entity230 that they head out for a good old - fashioned pizza next time , she was met with an outcry			2
@entity2 demanded that they instead return to @entity7 , her new favorite joint ; along with the rest of the world it seems .			1
