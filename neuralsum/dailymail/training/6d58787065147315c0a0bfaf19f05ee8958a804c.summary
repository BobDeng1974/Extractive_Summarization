by @entity0 an @entity2 surgeon and his hospital are being accused of greed and negligence in a series of malpractice lawsuits			1
dr. @entity8 , formerly a surgeon at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , are facing hundreds of malpractice lawsuits over accusations he sliced people open and sewed them back up without actually performing any procedures , or that he performed the wrong surgery scheduling as many as 22 surgeries a day , an almost unheard of workload , @entity8 was billing for work never completed and his out of control greed resulted in the death of a 76 - year - old woman , one of the lawsuits alleges			1
under fire : dr. @entity8 is accused of performing ' phantom surgeries ' on dozens of patients , and is blamed at least one known death @entity8 reportedly would schedule up to 22 surgeries a day , most surgeons only schedule 32 procedures a month , according to industry statistics quoted by @entity31			1
@entity32 alleges that in 2009 @entity8 was to have performed surgery on her 76 - year - old mother @entity34 ’s left knee to repair damage caused by arthritis , according to @entity31			1
@entity8 is said to have described the procedure as ‘ a simple in and out			2
’ the procedure involved a small camera being inserted into @entity34 ’s knee to help clean out any dead or damaged tissue found , a fairly routine procedure			2
@entity32 claims that less than 24 hours after the surgery , @entity34 died of a pulmonary embolism said to have been caused by a blood clot that broke free and blocked the lung ’s main artery , according to reports			0
though not a common occurrence from knee surgery , older adults are more prone to such complications from any type of surgery			0
the @entity56 ( @entity2 ) medical examiner ’s report , purportedly , is what did @entity8 in			2
tragic : @entity34 , second from left , is alleged to have died as a result of negligence on the part of @entity64 @entity8 allegedly had fudged all the post-surgery notes related to the six procedures he had performed on the family patriarch			1
the medical examiner 's autopsy showed no evidence that he had ever removed torn cartilage , smoothed areas of excess wear or removed soft tissue from within the knee joint – he simply opened and closed her knee without so much as a single bit of repair , the @entity68 originally reported			0
‘ he put her under anesthesia , placed the scope in her knee and then closed her up without performing any surgery , ’ @entity80 , @entity32 ’s lawyer told @entity31			0
‘ the reports showed no hardware in place and , certainly , no evidence of a total knee reconstruction			0
’ @entity32 ’s case was n’t a one - off , according to several reports			2
former patients have brought a total of 250 malpractice suits against @entity95 , parent of @entity97 and @entity98 , and @entity64 , according to reports			1
both hospitals , located in @entity10 , have declined on multiple occasions to comment , as has @entity64			0
a message seeking comment left with @entity104 , @entity8 ' attorney , was not returned			2
evading liability ? : many are accusing the @entity95 , @entity64 ' former employer , of trying to evade liability by attempting to transfer assets to @entity110 in another instance , @entity8 is accused of having performed the wrong surgery			1
@entity113 was to have a broken collarbone fixed by @entity64 in 2010 , instead he operated on her rotator cuff as if it was broken , despite there being no evidence to suggest that procedure was necessary , she told the @entity68			0
dismissed : @entity95 dismissed @entity8 over the alleged malpractices making matters even worse , the @entity95 is in the midst of a deal that some believe is an effort to evade liability over @entity8 , who has since been fired and is also under a federal investigation			1
rival @entity110 and @entity95 are trying combine assets in a transaction that will transfer ownership of current @entity132 asset to @entity133 , leaving @entity134 as nothing more than a shell company that would eventually dissolve , according to the @entity68			1
though both sides are adamant the merger is about providing the best care to patients in the region , not everyone is convinced			0
‘ they are taking what ’s valuable and will leave a defunct shell , ’ said @entity143 , an attorney representing 152 plaintiffs suing @entity64			0
explaining that @entity133 would take @entity134 ’s doctors , and its revenue , financial expert @entity148 told the paper that ‘ you ca n’t sue someone with no money			0
