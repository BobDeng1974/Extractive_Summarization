by @entity0 last updated at 12:07 pm on 22nd november 2011 former @entity2 governor @entity1 has been branded ' dishonest and deceitful ' for turning president @entity4 's own words against him in the first television ad of his 2012 @entity7 bid			1
the @entity10 candidate 's commercial is set to start airing in @entity11 later today , hours before the president visits the state			1
it compares @entity4 's 2008 promises as a candidate - to turn around the economy , stem foreclosures and rescue the middle - class - with economic statistics that suggest the incumbent president has come up short			1
' i 'm going to do something to government , ' he says in the ad , using footage taken during a recent stop in @entity32 , @entity33			2
he then promises to repeal @entity35 ' health care overhaul that he says is ' killing jobs '			0
' it 's high time to bring those principles of fiscal responsibility to @entity40 ' the 60 - second ad features clips of an @entity4 campaign stop in @entity44 , @entity11 , in october 2008 and fresh footage from @entity1 events from recent days			1
but the @entity4 re-election team is unhappy with what they describe as a ' deceitful ' ad			1
campaign spokesman @entity50 told the @entity51 : ' while the president brought us back from the brink of another depression and is fighting everyday to restore economic security for the middle class , @entity1 opposes the president 's plan to create two million jobs and instead proposes a return to the same economic policies that led to the recession			1
' the commercial is slated to run until the end of this coming @entity66 weekend at a cost of $ 134,000 ( Â£ 85,000 )			2
@entity4 on the campaign trail in 2008			1
a spokesman for his 2012 re-election campaign today defended the president 's economic track record on the up : @entity1 speaks on the steps of @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity11 , on sunday after receiving the endorsement of senator @entity79 ( left ) @entity1 told @entity80 last night : ' the contrast between what he said and what he did is so stark , people will recognise we really do need to have someone new lead this country			1
' @entity1 , who is at the top of state polls and is sitting on a mound of campaign cash , has kept his focus on @entity4 over the past year and largely has shied from criticising his @entity10 rivals			1
he said : ' i want people to remember that when he was candidate @entity4 , that he said he was going to get this economy going , he was going to bring people together , be a real leader for change in @entity102 , " @entity1 said			1
@entity4 is set to arrive in @entity11 today to deliver an economic speech			1
for months , @entity1 has given interviews to local reporters in states @entity4 had on his schedule , either pre-empting the president 's message or rebutting it			1
@entity1 hopes to later today use one - time rival @entity110 and senator @entity79 of @entity11 to make the case for @entity1 as a superior choice			1
both have backed @entity1 's presidential bid			2
yet @entity1 elected to use his first paid television ad not to promote himself or criticise his rivals but to take on the man he hopes to face in november 2012			1
he said : ' clearly , the president ca n't run on his track record			2
his track record is miserable			0
' so what he 'll do is try and assassinate , on a character basis , his opponents and / or his opposition			0
i 'm hoping that 's me , but i 'm not looking forward to those attacks			2
' even in a softer interview with @entity128 , @entity1 kept his criticism on point			0
asked by the celebrity magazine to say something nice about his potential rival , @entity1 praised @entity4 's merit pay for teachers and said @entity4 was ' a good example of a husband and father '			1
then he went back to his familiar refrain			0
' but the plusses are far exceeded by the places where i 'd give him a minus , ' @entity1 said			0
the interview included some non-political questions about his @entity147 faith			0
' @entity148 had drinks or tobacco , ' @entity1 told the magazine when asked if he 's ever had a beer			2
' it 's a religious thing			0
i tasted a beer and tried a cigarette once , as a wayward teenager , and never did it again			0
' @entity158 : really a grandmother ? reports of dirty tricks reached unprecedented levels during the 2008 @entity102 presidential election			0
@entity10 vice presidential candidate @entity158 faced rumours suggesting she was really the grandmother of her youngest son			0
internet sites were buzzing with unproven claims that mrs @entity158 's daughter @entity169 , then 17 , was the real mother of her four - month - old son @entity158			2
elsewhere , complaints surfaced in predominantly @entity172 neighbourhoods of @entity173 where fliers circulated warning voters they could be arrested at the polls if they had unpaid parking tickets or a criminal conviction			0
in @entity181 , bogus fliers with an authentic - looking seal said fears of high voter turnout had prompted election officials to hold two elections - one on tuesday for @entity10 , the correct day , and another on wednesday for @entity35 , which would have been a day late			0
in @entity188 , @entity187 voters said they had received calls from people describing themselves as @entity4 volunteers , urging them to cast their ballot over the phone			2
in @entity195 , emails appeared linking @entity196 @entity4 to the @entity197			2
' @entity198 can not afford to make the wrong decision on tuesday , nov. 4 , ' said the electronic message , paid for by an entity calling itself the @entity202			0
' many of our ancestors ignored the warning signs in the 1930s and 1940s and made a tragic mistake			0
' @entity210 , who then led the @entity212 's @entity211 , said he has never seen ' an election where there was more interest and more voter turnout , and more efforts to suppress registration and turnout			0
and that has a real impact on minorities			0
' watch the @entity1 campaign 's first tv ad here :			1
