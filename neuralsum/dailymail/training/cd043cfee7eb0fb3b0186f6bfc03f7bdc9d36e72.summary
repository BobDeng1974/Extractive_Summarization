@entity0 has urged his @entity2 team - mates to forget their ' nightmare ' against @entity4 and finish the @entity6 group stage campaign on a high			1
the @entity7 take on @entity8 in @entity9 on tuesday night knowing that they must win to have a chance of finishing top in @entity12 but their chances remain slim as they are also relying on a slip - up by @entity15 against @entity4 , who came from 3 - 0 down to draw 3 - 3 with @entity2 at the @entity18 last month			1
@entity2 's @entity0 is wrapped up as he arrives for a training session at @entity20 on monday @entity0 ( front right ) trains with his team - mates on monday but will not feature against @entity8 and that slip - up looks as if it will end up costing the @entity7 in terms of last - 16 opposition as they are now likely to finish second in their group			1
@entity0 told fourfourtwo : ' the @entity4 game was a nightmare for us			2
to be leading them 3 - 0 and then allowing them to come back from three goals down in your own home is unacceptable			2
' it ’s something inexplicable that happened to us and we have to get over it , we have to show everyone that we can react well and in the right way , even though it looks like we ’ll be second in the group instead of first			0
@entity2 manager @entity43 ( right ) and @entity44 speak to the press in @entity9 @entity4 's @entity46 ( third right ) scores the equaliser in a 3 - 3 draw against @entity2 last month ' we know it ’s worse because we ’re going to have to play opponents who finished first and are at a really high level , like in the last few seasons when we met @entity54			1
but ultimately , if you want to win the @entity6 or have ambitions to win it you have to play the best			0
' we ’d obviously prefer to play a weaker rival , but if we end up against a first class opponent then we have to get on with it and try to beat them if we want to achieve something big			0
qualifying is the main thing			0
' @entity0 will not feature in tuesday 's match with the @entity67 midfielder staying at home in @entity69 to rest .			0
