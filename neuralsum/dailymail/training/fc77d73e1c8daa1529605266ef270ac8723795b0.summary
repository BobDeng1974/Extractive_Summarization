when women first started coming forward to accuse @entity2 of rape last month , the public was surprised due to his flawless reputation as ' @entity6 's dad '			1
it has now been revealed that a team of lawyers and publicists worked tirelessly to keep his image pristine for decades , by silencing alleged victims and keeping the media from reporting their claims , the @entity7 reports			1
that apparently all - male team includes $ 850 - an - hour @entity18 lawyer @entity17 ( whose clients include @entity20 and @entity21 ) , former @entity23 agent @entity22 , his publicist son @entity24 , and @entity26 lawyer @entity25			0
a new report reveals how his legal and media teams have protected his reputation for decades protectors : high - profile @entity18 attorney @entity17 ( left ) , former @entity23 agent @entity22 ( center ) , and @entity26 lawyer @entity25 ( right ) are three representatives of @entity2 's who have helped silence the rape accusations over the years most of the allegations against @entity2 date back to the 1970s , which led to speculation over why the women stayed silent for so long			1
like many rape victims , some of the women said they never reported the assault because they were scared of @entity2 ’s power and feared damaging their reputation			2
the reaction of @entity2 ’s legal team to the women brave enough to come forward over the years proves that those who stayed silent had good cause for concern			2
those who have reported their rapes , either to police or in the media , have had their claims called ‘ meritless ’ by @entity2 ’s legal team , who depict them as greedy women seeking to destroy the once - beloved comedian ’s reputation for a cut of his fortune			1
this pattern of intimidation goes all the way back to 2000 when an actress on his tv series ‘ @entity2 ’ allegedly told police that he tried to put her hand down his sweatpants during a visit to his @entity26 townhouse			0
@entity2 ’s lawyers threatened to sue the @entity83 with a $ 250million defamation lawsuit if they published comments from the alleged victim ’s relatives			2
but his legal team also works with the media to damage @entity2 ’s alleged victims and discredit their stories			1
just five years after threatening to sue the @entity83 , the paper was once again investigating claims against @entity2 after @entity95 employee @entity94 publicly accused the comedian of drugging and assaulting her at his @entity98 home			1
alleged victims : @entity94 ( left ) was one of the first victims to publicly accuse @entity2 when she filed a lawsuit against him in 2005			0
his team sought to discredit her by revealing that her mother asked @entity2 for money before she went to police			1
@entity109 ( right ) is another woman who want to accuse @entity2 that same year , but his team stopped a story from being published in the @entity83 the @entity83 was looking to report on claims by another woman , @entity109 , but @entity2 ’s team effectively silenced that woman ’s story by offering an exclusive story from @entity2 telling his side of the story			1
suing : @entity119 claims to have been sexually assaulted by @entity2 in the 1970s and told her story in 2005 to two outlets			1
she is now suing @entity2 for defamation , claiming his team as repeatedly depicted her as a liar in the media they employed the same tactic against @entity94 , whose mother allegedly asked @entity2 to ‘ make things right with money ’ before her daughter went to the police to report the crime and one of @entity2 ’s lawyers called the move ‘ a classic shakedown ’ , according to tv show celebrity justice which reported on the suit at the time			1
in court , @entity2 ’s legal team acknowledged that the lawyer in question was @entity17			2
@entity94 ’s suit was later settled out of court for an unknown sum			0
also in 2005 , a woman named @entity119 said she was sexually assaulted by @entity2 in @entity150 in the 1970s and told her story on the @entity151 and to the @entity152			0
@entity2 ’s lawyers called @entity154 ’s claims ‘ absolutely false ’ and even offered ‘ damaging information about her to the newspaper			1
as more and more women came forward in recent weeks to accuse @entity2 , @entity154 went public again with her story and @entity2 ’s lawyers reacted the same way - saying her claims were ‘ a 10 - year discredit accusation that proved to be nothing at the time , and is still nothing ’			1
@entity154 is now suing @entity2 for defamation , claiming she has been depicted as a liar with these statements and continued assault on her reputation			0
‘ i want it put to a jury			0
i want it ended , finally			0
i want my name restored , ’ she said earlier this month			0
one of the most shocking claims in the scandal comes from a woman named @entity181 who says she was just 15 years old when @entity2 got her drunk and forced her to perform a sex act on him at the @entity184			2
so young : @entity181 claims she was sexually assaulted by @entity2 at the @entity184 when she was just 15 years old			2
his team sought to discredit her claims by revealing she unsuccessfully tried to sell her story to a tabloid a decade ago			2
pictured with @entity2 around the time of the assault @entity181 filed a lawsuit against @entity2 this month , but his lawyer @entity17 has tried to discredit the claims by revealing that @entity181 unsuccessfully attempted to sell her story to a tabloid a decade ago			1
celebrity : former supermodel @entity196 is another one of the more than two dozen women who have come forward to accuse @entity2			2
@entity2 's team threatened @entity199 as they were preparing an article on her account in court records , @entity17 has called her claims ‘ meritless ’ and a ‘ shakedown ’			1
@entity2 ’s legal team is just as threatening with the media , and have in recent weeks sent letters to outlets like @entity208 and the @entity209 urging them to stop their coverage of the scandal			1
‘ the media has consistently refused to look into or publish information about various women whose stories are contradicted by their own conduct or statement , ’ @entity17 wrote in a letter to @entity214 , obtained by the @entity7			0
@entity2 ’s lawyers also tried to stop @entity199 from publishing an account from former supermodel @entity196 , who has also accused the comedian of sexual assault			1
‘ you proceed at your own peril , ’ @entity17 wrote to the website , pointing out inconsistencies between @entity196 ’s story and what she wrote in her memoir			0
just yesterday in a story published in the @entity233 , @entity17 blamed the media for reporting on claims from women he does n’t believe have been properly vetted			0
‘ you [ the media ] do n’t need private investigators to find out information about the accusers			1
a simple @entity242 search will obtain the information , ’ @entity17 said in a statement			0

@entity2 allegedly spoke with his legal and public relations teams about the sex scandal , and his response to it , at a recent meeting			0
' if you ’re going to say to the world that i did this to you , then the world needs to know , ‘ what kind of person are you ? who is this person that ’s saying it ? ’ ' @entity2 said , according to an anonymous source who was present at the meeting			0
' you ca n’t say that i put something in your coffee , threw you in a cab and then you go on and live a high - profile life , a famous life and you never complain			0
you mean you never reported it to the police ? you never tell anyone ? ' @entity2 continued , referring to one of his accusers , @entity281			2
@entity281 claimed that @entity2 raped her after slipping a drug into her cappuccino during a visit to his home in the 1980s			0
