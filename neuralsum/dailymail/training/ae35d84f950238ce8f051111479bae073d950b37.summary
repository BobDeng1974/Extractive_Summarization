her sexy wardrobe have earned her the nickname ‘ @entity4 ’ in her native @entity5			1
it ’s the kind of profile you would normally associate with , say , a footballer ’s wife , or a model , not a prime minister			2
but then @entity5 leader @entity13 , 46 , who dragged @entity14 and @entity15 into that embarrassing ‘ selfie ’ , is not a typical head of state , not by @entity19 standards anyway			1
@entity5 prime minister @entity13 , pictured with her husband @entity20 last year how many premiers , for example , when heckled at a public meeting about their wardrobe would have replied bluntly : ‘ we ca n’t all look like s * * *			1
’ or boarded a military plane to wartorn @entity28 in camouflage jacket and stilettos , with a bright red @entity4 handbag ( the headline in one @entity5 newspaper screamed : ‘ @entity34 ’ )			1
not surprisingly , her sex appeal , which @entity37 seems to have exploited to the full , almost certainly contributed to her electoral success back in 2011			2
the word most googled next to her name during the election campaign , it would later emerge , was ‘ naked ’			2
it is not clear , however , if voters expected to find naked photographs of her on the internet – or simply hoped to			2
@entity13 and @entity20 , son of the former leader of the @entity53 @entity52 , have two daughters together and have been married since 1996 @entity5 magazines , meanwhile , claim her looks have been enhanced by @entity57			1
( ‘ @entity58 – see revealing images of the prime minister inside ’ )			2
indeed , her career reads like a script from @entity63 , the cult @entity5 political drama screened on @entity66 and featuring fictional prime minister @entity67			1
miss @entity13 has often compared herself to her tv counterpart			1
certainly , her time in office has been dogged by scandal and gossip about her personal life			2
we have a particular interest in @entity37 here in @entity19 , of course , because she is married to former @entity53 leader @entity52 ’s son , @entity20 , 42			1
their domestic arrangements are unusual , and the source of some controversy			0
@entity20 was a director of the @entity82 until 2012 and used to live in @entity83 , @entity84 , spending no more than 33 weekends in @entity5 , apparently			1
under @entity5 law , his non-resident status allowed his wife to deduct about £ 40,000 in tax from the mortgage repayments on their £ 500,000 house in @entity92			1
pulling faces : prime minister @entity13 meets her @entity19 counterpart shortly after taking office in 2011 but in a recent application to make him co-owner of the family home , @entity37 claimed her husband was there ‘ every weekend of the year ’			1
when challenged she was forced to admit she had made ‘ sloppy mistakes ’ in filing out her tax returns and her husband was non-resident			0
@entity5 tax authorities later exonerated the couple			1
but there was further embarrassment			0
their marriage became the subject of intense speculation in the @entity5 press , with one newspaper raising questions over mr @entity20 ’s sexuality			1
confronted with the allegations , @entity37 was forced to publicly deny mr @entity20 was gay			1
‘ i can only say it ’s not true , ’ she declared			0
‘ it ’s so grotesque			0
it is unpleasant to hear people talk about us like that			0
’ what was the source of these rumours – apart , that is , from the fact the couple were leading very separate lives ? miss @entity13 has often compared herself to her tv counterpart , fictional prime minister @entity67 ( right , played by @entity130 ) on the cult @entity5 political drama @entity63 it was this : their accountant had told the tax officials that mr @entity20 was ‘ bisexual or gay ’ to explain why he did not spend time in @entity5 , and was not , therefore , liable for unpaid taxes			1
but details of this confidential meeting – and the accountant ’s claims – were leaked to the press			0
‘ i admit it that i said it , ’ the accountant , @entity147 , said when he was contacted by journalists			0
‘ it was a mistake that i am still quite uneasy about today			0
’ the couple met in their twenties while working in @entity155 and married in a civil ceremony in 1996			0
at the time , @entity20 ’s parents were establishing themselves as the gilded couple of the @entity159			1
@entity52 was then a @entity160 commissioner and wife @entity161 was @entity162 mp for @entity163			1
‘ they are very clever , caring people , ’ said @entity37			0
‘ we spend a lot of time with them in @entity155			0
’ apparently , they send the glamorous @entity172 joke text messages whenever @entity63 is on the tv			0
from the very beginning , though , @entity37 ’s appearance , not just her political credentials , dominated the headlines			0
she became the country ’s first woman prime minister on october 3 , 2011			0
but it was not long before stories emerged of her expensive tastes			0
one of her handbags from the luxury @entity19 label @entity185 cost between £ 6,000 and £ 9,000			0
another favourite brand was the exclusive @entity5 fashion house @entity190			2
@entity13 seems to revel in the attention – if it wins her votes			2
and , especially , it seems , admiring glances from flirtatious male statesmen .			0

@entity13 , 46 , is an *unconventional* head of state
the @entity5 pm has been nicknamed ' @entity4 ' for her wardrobe
@entity20 , @entity52 *'s* son , had to fight off ' gay ' rumours
