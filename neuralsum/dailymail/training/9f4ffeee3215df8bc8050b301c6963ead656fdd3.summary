by @entity0 published : 10:50 est , 21 january 2014 updated : 11:18 est , 21 january 2014 he 's spent most of the last seven years in prison , has been arrested more than 20 times and missed seeing his children grow @entity7 ? because ' @entity8 ' @entity8 simply wo n't keep his clothes on in public			1
now mr @entity8 , 55 , from @entity11 , is to appear in a new documentary in which he attempts to explain the reasoning behind the nudity that has left him a stranger to his teenage son and daughter			1
although imprisoned earlier this month , this time for close to two years , the former marine claims that his love of baring all is - despite the repeated spells in jail - all about freedom			1
defiant : @entity8 , aka the @entity8 , says he has no plans to stop walking while in the buff long suffering : @entity26 , mr @entity8 's former wife , finds his behaviour hard to understand ' i like wearing clothes but the thing about clothes is that i want to be able to wear what i want to wear , ' he explains in a scene from the @entity35 film			1
' i get up in the morning and i want to put on what i want ... some people , like naturists and that , nudists , they heat up their house especially so they can go naked and i think that 's nuts			2
' one person who 's far from convinced by his claims is his former wife @entity26 , who says she 's baffled by his insistence on going naked			2
' it is extraordinary , really , ' she says			2
' i do n't think the legal system can believe that someone , given the choice of " put your clothes on and you 're a free man " or " you do n't and we 'll lock you up in solitary confinement " , would choose " oh , solitary confinement for me please "			2
' i do n't think anyone saw that coming			0
' since his nude rambling career began with a walk from @entity60 to @entity61 in 2004 , mr @entity8 has been arrested countless times and has spent years in prison			1
although appearing nude in public is n't technically a crime , if someone complains , it can be considered a breach of the peace or more seriously , an outrage to public decency			1
mr @entity8 's most recent conviction , for breaching an asbo that banned him from being naked in public places , resulted in a 16 - month sentence			1
recorder @entity76 , who presided over the court , told him : ' i ’m afraid there is going to be a revolving door in and out of prison , because you are intent on flouting these orders and there is absolutely no way you are going to comply with them			1
’ chilly : during the new film , mr @entity8 is seen walking in the rain , the snow and in temperatures of -1 while nude under arrest : mr @entity8 photographed during one of his many arrests			1
there have now been more than 20 home : after walking back from @entity96 last year , mr @entity8 was in trouble within days of arriving it 's an attitude that has left his 86 - year - old mother @entity99 baffled			1
' i do n't understand why he 's doing it , ' she sighs			0
' i never have understood it			0
i know it 's something to do with freedom but he 's not free , is he ? stuck in jail for six years ... that 's not free ! ' it seems that 's a useless way of living your life to me			0
' @entity8 , however , believes that his mission to share his insight about the freedom nudity brings is important and claims that his naked rambling is of genuine help to people			1
' i help them to confront their false beliefs about who they are , ' he explains			0
they need someone like me to come along and challenge them			0
' we consider ourselves a democratic and free society but how far does that go ? there 's a bigger thing at stake			0
' he pauses and adds : ' i 'm not sure what it is but ... ' before trailing off			0
once again , it seems that not every member of the public is happy to embrace his views			0
during one scene in the new film , he 's seen blithely wandering past a school as the children leave - much to the outrage of the parents			2
in another , he 's heckled by an irate passer - by in @entity96 , who tells him : ' you 're a disgrace ! a real disgrace ! he adds : ' that does not do any good in this day and age for this country			2
what point is he trying to prove ? he 's not proving anything to anyone apart from that he 's an idiot			0
' despite the brickbats and the ever - growing amount of time spent at her majesty 's pleasure , @entity8 remains committed to his unusual mission , despite the impact it has had on his family			1
' that 's just how life 's turned out , ' he muses			0
' i do n't regret it , even though it means i 've been separated from my children			0
' sometimes , you 've got to follow your passions in life even when that means you ca n't be with your children or people you love			0
' you can only hope that his children agree			0
