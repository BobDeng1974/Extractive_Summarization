on trial : @entity16 , pictured left in a photo submitted for evidence , is on trial for carrying out the deadly bombings with his older brother , @entity259 , right , who later died during a shootout with police by painting @entity259 as the driving force behind the attacks , the defense aims to spare the younger @entity16 a death sentence and secure him a life sentence instead			2
after the prosecution calls its last witness , the defense will have a chance to call its own witnesses , which could include @entity16 himself			0
but they will be limited in how much evidence they put forward about the relative blame of the two brothers before the jury determines whether their client is guilty of the charges he faces			0
if the jury does find him guilty , the trial will enter a penalty phase , when both sides will call another round of witnesses before the same jury determines whether @entity16 should be sentenced to death or to life in prison without the possibility of parole .			0
