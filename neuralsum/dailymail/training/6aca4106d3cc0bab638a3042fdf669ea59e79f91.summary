the foundations of a huge @entity2 feasting hall , the first to be discovered in more than 30 years , has been found below a village green in @entity4			1
the hall , where a king and his warriors would have enjoyed epic days - long feasts , has laid just inches underground for 1,300 years			0
a team from the @entity10 working with villagers and local archaeologists made the exceptional discovery in @entity14 , @entity4			1
at 69 feet by 28 feet , the hall would have been an impressive structure with room for at least 60 people			1
excavation site : an aerial view of the foundations of a @entity2 feasting hall found below a village green in @entity14 , @entity4 animals bones which were found buried in pits near the edge of the hall signal the many extravagant feasts held at the biggest hall for miles around , before it was abandoned and later destroyed			1
a piece of gilded horse harness was also found among the foundations which has helped archaeologists date the site to the late sixth or early seventh century			1
jewellery , bone combs and a well preserved manicure set consisting of three small bronze rods strung onto a piece of wire were also found			1
dr @entity42 , director of the @entity14 excavations , told @entity44 : ‘ the horse harness decoration is very significant			1
horse harness mount : this high - status gilt copper - alloy decorative mount would probably have been attached to a bridle or harness for a horse , dating it to c.525 - 575 ad			1
this finding supports the view of @entity55 culture in this period being based on a warrior society , with horses at forefront of this ideal grooming set : sets consisted of three bronze tools attached to a wire ring			0
they often have scrapers for nails , ' ear scoops ' for the age - old ear wax problem , and tweezers triangular bone combs : two triangular composite bone combs were found			2
they are made of three pieces of bone riveted together , the central piece being the carefully sawed teeth animal skulls : animals bones which were found buried in pits near the edge of the hall signal the many extravagant feasts held at the hall ‘ it 's not just a wonderful find , but evidence of the status of the people who used this site			1
the ability to own and upkeep a horse was the mark of the warrior aristocracy			2
’ dr @entity42 mentions @entity94 , the most famous of all surviving @entity2 poems , is set in the late fifth century and describes the eponymous hero coming to a hall such as the one most recently discovered			0
he said : ‘ this would undoubtedly have been the scene of many @entity101 type activities , great assemblies for feasts that lasted for days , much drinking and story - telling , rich gifts like arm rings being presented , all of that			0
‘ there could have been no more visible sign of wealth and status than raising a hall like this			0
‘ this is before centralised tax collecting and coinage , too early for royal palaces as such			0
‘ to keep control you had to keep on the move , stopping at significant places , literally feeding off the land , off the rich food offerings that would be brought everywhere the king arrived			0
’ feasting : @entity94 , the most famous of @entity2 poems , describes the eponymous hero coming to a hall such as the one discovered @entity130 , @entity131 journalist , dresses as a 6th - century woman at @entity135 settlement of @entity136 , in @entity137 ( file picture ) dr @entity42 believes that the hall foundations indicate the last of the ancient pagan rituals			2
the timber from the structure is long gone but archaeologists found the outline of the building by post holes and plank gaps for the wood to be laid horizontally to create the walls			1
the team came to @entity14 last summer and searched the site which had been open land for almost 1,000 years			1
ground penetrating radar suggested there were some structures underground but nothing quite as big as what they found			2
there is evidence that the hall was damaged , if not destroyed , by fire which was a common fate for wooden buildings centered on an open hearth			0
dr @entity42 said he believes the hall was abandoned deliberately as the @entity135 of that tribe , along with many others , turned to @entity168			0
the settlement at the site was also abandoned and a new village settled on a hill nearby a new church			2
previous excavations in the village , just a few miles from the @entity176 terminal , including in the church graveyard have revealed thousands of years of habitation in the area			2
the graveyard was founded in @entity182 and is said to be the original burial place of @entity184			0
at 69 feet by 28 feet , the hall would have been an impressive structure with room for at least 60 people			1
pictured here is the cricket field in @entity14 , @entity4 dr @entity191 , an @entity2 specialist from the @entity192 , described the discovery as a ' fantastic achievement and a major find for understanding the kingdom of @entity4			1
' he told the @entity197 : ' it is a very rare find			0
in @entity4 we have found lots of cemeteries and rich burials but have been much less successful at finding where people lived			1
although little farms have been found this discovery of one of the major halls is incredible			0
' dr @entity191 explained how after the collapse of @entity211 in the fifth century , @entity4 quickly established itself as a sophisticated independent kingdom which made the most of its location by tapping into trade networks			2
' this hall would have been used for high - status feasting full of wealthy and sophisticated people , ' said dr @entity191			0
the archaeologists plan to return next summer			0
mr @entity42 said : ' there ’s more of this story			0
