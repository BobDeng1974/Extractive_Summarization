an art fan who unwittingly bought two paintings by street artist @entity3 in @entity4 for just $ 60 each is expected to receive a $ 160,000 windfall when the prints go up for auction			1
as part of his month - long @entity11 residency last october , the elusive graffiti artist foxed even his most ardent fans by secretly selling authentic artworks one saturday afternoon			1
the art fan , who has n’t been named , purchased two of the signed spray - painted prints entitled @entity17 and @entity18			1
a representative for the auction house told @entity33 that they are expected to fetch roughly $ 65,000 and $ 95,000 , respectively			2
during his month - long residency in @entity11 last october , @entity3 vowed to produce one piece of street art each day			1
on the 13th day of his residency , the @entity38 - based artist displayed dozens of original , signed canvases at a pop - up stall attended by an unknown man			2
surprising : for his 13th day in @entity11 , @entity3 pulled a fantastic prank by setting up an unannounced art stall with dozens of 100 % original signed canvases for $ 60 each the stand was n’t a huge success and after seven hours just three people had bought eight canvases - a total haul of $ 420			1
the first sale was at 3.30pm to a woman who bought two canvases for her children - and she managed to wrangle a 50 per cent discount			2
half an hour later , a @entity58 woman purchased some art. @entity60 shows the vendor embracing her warmly and kissing her cheek			0
at 5.30pm , a @entity64 man rocked up seeking art for his new house : ' i just need something for the walls			0
' he left with four original @entity70			1
the day after the sale , @entity3 revealed what has happened via his website			0
bemused : the stand was manned by an unknown man who seemed completely uninterested in what he was doing first customer : the store made its first sale at 3.30pm on saturday			0
a woman bought two canvases for her children but negotiated a 50 per cent discount sale no. 2 : at 4pm , a woman from @entity58 bought two artworks , to the delight of the merchant ‘ yesterday i set up a stall in the park selling 100 percent authentic original signed @entity3 canvases			1
for $ 60 each , ’ he wrote			2
the paintings have since been ' authenticated ' by @entity3 , a rep from the auction house said			0
the art was first thought to be worth $ 250,000 but that estimate was too high , the rep said			0
one of the paintings features an image of @entity17 sitting under a tree next to a tossed - out honey pot. the other depicts two kids standing on a hillock of guns and bombs			0
the art house has not yet set a date for the auction			0
final sale : the last sale of the day was at 6.30pm when a @entity64 man rocked up looking for art to decorate his new house			0
judging by the big man hug , it must have been an emotional sale dismal : the merchant shut up shop at 6.30pm , taking in just $ 420 after more than six hours on the job			1

an art fan who got lucky when they unwittingly purchased two original @entity70 for $ 60 each is auctioning them and is expected to raise $ 160,000
