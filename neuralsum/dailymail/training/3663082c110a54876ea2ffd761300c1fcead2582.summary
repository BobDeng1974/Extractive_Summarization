a controversial @entity1 scientist claims to have found ' proof ' that aliens exist - after cracking open a lump of rock which he believes fell to earth in a meteorite shower			1
professor @entity9 , formerly of @entity10 , claims the two - inch wide lump of space rock is pitted with microscopic seaweed fossils similar to those found on @entity15			1
' these finds are crushing evidence that human life started from outside our @entity15 , ' said the professor , who is notorious for his theories that life on this planet was ' seeded ' from outer space			1
claims : professor @entity9 with the fragment of space rock teeming with traces of life ? a controversial scientist claims this two - inch meteor fragment is packed with the fossils of extraterrestrial life similar to algae found in @entity15 's oceans ' we got it from the medical research institute in @entity40 , ' professor @entity9 told @entity41			1
' they got hold of it on the 29th december , when a fireball was seen in the area			2
' thousands of people spotted it , and minutes after there was a meteorite fall over a rice field			0
' farmers who rushed to pick up these stones had their hands burnt , and women fainted , so local medical staff and police were summoned to cordon off the area to collect the stones			0
' one of these was sent to us by colleagues			0
' ' we are all aliens - we share a cosmic ancestry , ' he said			2
' each time a new planetary system forms a few surviving microbes find their way into comets			0
' these then multiply and seed other planets			0
' these latest finds are just more evidence to point to the overwhelming fact that life on @entity15 began on other worlds			2
' ' our provisional assessment is that it was part of a comet ' , he told @entity41			0
' the stones look extremely unusual , and have a porous structure , with a lower density than anything we have on @entity15			2
' professor @entity9 's claims are outlined in a freely accessible paper on the website of the @entity89			1
it says ' a few percent carbon as revealed by analysis confirms the status of a carbonaceous meteorite			0
' however , today he admitted key tests to prove it is an uncontaminated meteorite have not yet been carried out			1
' this was a rapid publication - we wanted to provoke interest , and we will be publishing in a peer reviewed journal , but we are not sure which yet one			0
' it is the facts that will prove this - and we hope to have conclusive proof within weeks			1
' however , a string of experts have already lined up to dismiss his claims as ' laughable ' and argue that the apparent extra-terrestrial fossils are clearly present as the result of contamination here on @entity15			1
another points out that it has yet to be proven that the rock is actually from space at all			2
' describing it as laughable is a natural reaction , that is the traditional view , and until all of these tests are completed , these criticisms are out there , ' he said			2
the research alleges that ' microscopic fossilized diatoms ( a basic form of algae ) were found in the sample ' , which fell in @entity40 in december last year			1
the finding , it suggests , is a ' strong evidence to support the theory of cometary panspermia ' - the idea that life across planets is spread on rocks hurtling through space			1
the still - smoking meteorite fragments were picked up by villagers in central @entity40 after they crashed to @entity15 in a spectacular fireball , it is claimed			1
they were analysed in a @entity1 laboratory where fossils of algae were apparently found			0
it is claimed the finds are similar to micro-organisms found in fossil remains from the dinosaur age 55million years ago			1
smoking gun ? this scanning electron microscope image purports to show the tell - tale sign of a microscopic fossil ' crushing evidence ' : it is claimed the fossilised micro-organisms found in the fragment are similar to those found in fossil remains from the dinosaur age 55million years ago from far , far away : the two - inch wide piece of meteorite was found near a village a few miles from the city of @entity169 in @entity40 a mathematician by training , professor @entity9 believes that life on @entity15 was seeded by comets and asteroids 3.8billion years ago			1
@entity9 is notorious as the only scientist to argue against evolution during the 1981 @entity179 legal case against the teaching of creationism in schools			1
the 74 - year - old @entity40 - born @entity1 mathematician obtained a phd from @entity185 under the supervision of the late sir @entity187			2
the pair went on to collaborate on a body of work some credit with providing the basis of the field of astrobiology			0
their joint work on the infrared spectra of interstellar grains led to developing the hypothesis of panspermia , which proposes that cosmic dust in space and comets is partly organic - and may have ' seeded ' life on @entity15			1
they further contended that extraterrestrial life forms continue to enter the @entity15 's atmosphere , and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks , new diseases , and the genetic novelty necessary for macroevolution			2
in 2003 he was joint signatory on a letter sent to @entity214 which suggested that the virus which causes @entity216 may not come from chickens , but could in fact be from outer space			0
he was head of @entity10 's @entity221 until two years ago , when funding was withdrawn and he was dismissed from his post			1
he also believes that pathogens like the sars virus arrived here from deep space			0
he was head of @entity10 's @entity221 until two years ago when funding for the department was withdrawn and he was dismissed from his post			1
the controversial professor , the only scientist to testify against evolution in the famous 1981 creationist trial in @entity179 , has since carried on the project as a private company and charity			0
he said : ' the algae organisms are similar to ones found in @entity15 fossils but the rock also has other organisms we have not identified			1
' astronomer and lecturer @entity242 wrote in his blog on @entity245 that the chemical analysis presented in @entity9 's study ' does n’t prove it ’s a carbonaceous chondrite , let alone a meteorite , ' and there is ' no reason to trust that what they have is a meteorite			2
' @entity242 also cited a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology @entity256 as saying that there was no sign that the diatoms illustrated in the study were ' fossilized material ' , and that most of them were species that represented ' a clear case of contamination with freshwater '			0
@entity268 , professor of @entity269 at the @entity271 ’s @entity270 , told @entity41 she finds the whole thing ‘ laughable ’			2
‘ there are serious inconsistencies with the data presented in the paper , ' she said			0
‘ the most important is that the rock they have found is yet to be proven to be a meteorite			0
‘ until that is done , no credence can be placed on the findings presented , especially when they are published in a non-mainstream journal			0
' controversial : professor @entity9 , left , says the still - smoking rocks were found after they fell in @entity40 , right , after a dramatic meteor shower professor @entity9 is a leading proponent of panspermia , the hypothesis that life exists throughout the @entity289 and is spread by meteoroids , asteroids and planetoids			1
@entity293 proposes that life forms that can survive the effects of space , such as extremophiles , become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life			0
these life - forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks			0
if met with ideal conditions on a new planet 's surfaces , the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins , it is believed			0
professor @entity9 , 74 , claims microbes from outer space arrived on our planet from comets which then ' multiplied and seeded ' to form our life			1
the two - inch wide piece of meteorite was found near a village a few miles from the city of @entity169 in @entity40			1
the fragments were said to be still smoking when they were found by woman villagers			0
they were sent to @entity10 's @entity330 where they were examined under a scanning electron microscope			0
professor @entity9 , who is originally from @entity40 , and his late colleague sir @entity187 championed the ' life from outer space ' theory from the 1960s			1
he said : ' evidence from astronomy overwhelmingly supports the view that life did not start on @entity15 but was seeded from outside			2

two - inch lump of space rock is ' pitted with microscopic seaweed fossils '
fragment was ' still smoking ' after crashing to @entity15 in fireball over @entity40
professor @entity9 says he will have conclusive proof the rock came from space ' within weeks ' - but admits key tests to prove it is not been contaminated have not yet been done
*academic* is notorious for theory that @entity15 was ' seeded ' from space 3.8billion years ago
experts dismiss claims as ' laughable ' and say rock has been ' contaminated by fresh water '
