within 48 hours of being seen for the first time , the £ 44.95 wrap had sold out , while traffic to the brand 's website shot up by 1,960 per cent			0
and it did n't stop there			0
following the family 's portrait for @entity124 in 2013 , when the prince sported a baby blue number with ' @entity22 ' emblazoned on his chest , personalised baby clothes retailer @entity120 sold 1,200 jumpers in just four hours			1
then , the family 's tour of @entity132 and @entity71 in april last year , on which @entity22 played a prominent role , sent brand 's into a frenzy			2
the term ' the @entity22 effect ' was coined just three days after his birth when the £ 20 printed white aden + anais cloth in which the @entity39 and @entity11 wrapped their baby son before leaving the @entity111 of @entity112 sold out almost instantly following the family 's portrait for @entity124 in 2013 , when the prince sported a ' @entity22 ' emblazoned jumper , personalised baby clothes retailer @entity120 sold 1,200 jumpers in just four hours designers of the clothes the nine - month - old wore over the fortnight reported a huge surge in sales and the royal tot became something of a fashion icon			1
one such example is the @entity152 romper suit he wore on his arrival in @entity155 - a similar design totally sold out immediately and then had a shipping time of two months			0
the young prince looked dapper in the nautical - style romper suit as he disembarked an @entity132 @entity161 jet			0
he was blissfully unaware of the furore he caused , but within seconds of the royal trio arriving in @entity132 , @entity163 was awash with commentary about his ensemble			0
on a playdate in @entity71 , the tiny tot wore a stylish smocked romper from @entity171 , a @entity64 luxury brand for children , which retails at £ 77 ( aud $ 125 )			0
the family 's tour of @entity132 and @entity71 in april last year , on which @entity22 played a prominent role , sent brand 's into a frenzy			2
a similar version of the @entity179 romper suit he wore on his arrival in @entity155 , left , sold out immediately and the @entity171 smock , right , sold out in minutes online the classic tailored dungarees with a sailboat smocked design on the front panel sold out immediately in the six month and 12 month sizes on the company 's website			2

@entity193 launched @entity195 - two boxes ( one in blue and one in pink ) that the monthly beauty subscription service think any @entity200 would love			0
indeed , @entity201 , one of @entity11 's favourite shop 's , has launched the @entity204 2015			0
due to the success of the first collection , and inspired by the @entity11 's latest expectancy , the new collection features a moses basket based on the designs store owner @entity210 had while pregnant with her own son , @entity211			1
@entity212 , said : ' @entity11 has already had a major impact on the fashion market with the dresses that she ’s pictured in flying off the shelves as soon as they hit stores so she ’s destined to have the same effect on the baby wear market , too			1
' when @entity11 was photographed in @entity201 whilst pregnant , interest in @entity224 baskets definitely increased and sales of similar infant beds also boomed			0
' @entity201 , one of @entity11 's favourite shop 's , has launched the @entity204 2015 inspired by @entity22 @entity193 launched @entity195 - two boxes ( one in blue and one in pink ) that the monthly beauty subscription service think any @entity200 would love style and brand expert @entity232 added : ' it ’s refreshing to see that he ’s not too trendy he ’s just the perfect @entity236 gent			1
the @entity22 effect is due to him wearing clothes that are not designer labels but are wearable , affordable , on - trend colours and perfect for the royal spotlight			1
' a style icon is someone who creates a trend and with his nautical stripes , dungarees and baby grows with royal blue piping he certainly doing that			0
' and dressing baby sons around the world is clearly popular - the young royal even has his own style blog , what @entity22 wore , dedicated to all things baby style			2
but while the @entity11 might still be a dab hand at selling out whatever she wears , even she can not compete with her son when it comes to sheer selling power			0
from £ 44.95 swaddling wraps to knitted tank tops , the royal baby effect shows no sign of petering out - much to the excitement of childrenswear designers and @entity269 entrepreneurs contemplating another year of buoyant sales to come			1

@entity36 - based @entity35 has unveiled the ' @entity275 '
range includes boy 's t - shirts and romper suits and smocked dresses
@entity11 apparently shopped at @entity283 for @entity22
