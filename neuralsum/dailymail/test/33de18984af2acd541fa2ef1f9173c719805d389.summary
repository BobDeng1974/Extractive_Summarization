@entity1 's title prospects ' look great ' following their 2 - 0 win over bottom side @entity3 in @entity5 on friday night , according to @entity6			1
the @entity8 midfielder clinched the points with a 79th minute penalty after wide - man @entity11 had finished off a well - worked hoops move from close range to open the scoring			1
it took the @entity17 men eight points clear of @entity19 at the top of the @entity21 with both clubs having played 29 games albeit the @entity19 can reduce the deficit against @entity25 on saturday			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity6 believes his side 's title aspirations ' look great ' after their 2 - 0 win at @entity3 @entity30 's side have only lost one league game this year and take four successive victories into the home match against @entity25 on wednesday night which encouraged @entity6 , 24 , to say : ' it looks great for us now			1
it 's nine games left in the league and it 's going to be difficult to take us now			2
' this was another important win and we just need to keep focusing now on every game over the next couple of weeks			0
' i do n't think we 're unbeatable but you can say there is a huge confidence in the team now			0
' i think we are starting to look fitter and we have much more of the ball because we are playing with a higher tempo and that 's the way the manager wants us to play			0
' @entity6 scored @entity1 's second goal at @entity3 from the penalty spot on 79 minutes @entity30 criticised the ' terrible ' pitches in @entity56 football after the game , claiming the surface at @entity3 was another that was difficult to master			1
the visitors were certainly not at their best but @entity6 was glad the international break had not upset the @entity12 ' rhythm too much			2
the former @entity65 player said : ' some of the guys have had a few days off and some of the guys were away with the international teams so it was good to be back together and be prepared for the rest of the season			0
' @entity3 frustrated us for a while			2
they played well , especially in the first half and credit to them for that			0
the victory for @entity1 manager @entity30 's side now means they have won four successive league matches ' but we know that we had the ball so much that they would need to run			1
it was going to be difficult for them over 90 minutes so we knew it would open up			0
' @entity86 is hoping his @entity3 side , who ended the game still four points behind @entity91 , are not cut adrift before the split , which comes after they play the @entity91 on tuesday night and third - bottom @entity95 the following monday			1
he said : ' we need to make sure we 're within three points of @entity95 or @entity91 after the next two games			0
' if we can do that then that will give us a fighting chance			0
