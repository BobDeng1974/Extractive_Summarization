by @entity0 extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong @entity2 are expected to double , according to new research			1
climate scientists have warned that countries could be struck by devastating droughts , wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years			0
the impact of extreme @entity11 events is felt by every continent and the event in 1997 cost between $ 35billion to $ 45billion in damage			1
strong @entity11 events occur every 20 years or so , but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming			1
here , the village of @entity22 , @entity23 , is seen flooded in january 2003 as a result of @entity11 rains , which drove 16,000 people from their homes extreme @entity11 events develop differently from standard @entity28 , which first appear in the @entity29			2
the extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28 ° c develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial @entity29			0
this different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns			0
the new patterns result in flash floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others			0
extreme @entity11 events are expected to double in frequency over the next 100 years			1
the impact of extreme @entity11 events is felt by every continent			1
an international team of scientists from the @entity48 ( @entity49 ) , the @entity50 @entity51 and @entity52 , has spotted a link between global warming and extreme @entity11 events			1
‘ we currently experience an unusually strong @entity11 event every 20 years			1
our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years , ’ said @entity55 of @entity49 , who co-authored the study			1
‘ @entity11 events are a multi-dimensional problem and only now are we starting to understand better how they respond to global warming , ’ he added			0
extreme @entity11 events develop differently from standard @entity28 , which first appear in the @entity29			2
the extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28 ° c develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial @entity29			0
scientists in @entity67 recently said they can forecast disruptive @entity11 events a year in advance			0
they hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires , pictured in the @entity75			0
meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 @entity11 will be firmed up ' in the next month or two ' this different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns , which result in floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others			0
@entity89 of @entity50 @entity51 , said the question of how global warming will change the frequency of extreme @entity11 events has challenged scientists for more than 20 years			1
‘ this research is the first comprehensive examination of the issue to produce robust and convincing results , ’ he said			0
the impacts of extreme @entity11 events extend to every continent across the globe killed an around 23,000 people in the 1997 event			1
@entity103 , lead author of the study from @entity52 , said : ‘ during an extreme @entity11 event countries in the @entity29 , such as @entity106 and @entity107 , experienced devastating droughts and wild fires , while catastrophic floods occurred in the eastern equatorial region of @entity112 and northern @entity23			2
’ the scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme @entity11 events			1
this satellite image shows the @entity11 weather phenomena in 1997 , represented by the the white area at the equator , which shows how the warm waters stretch from @entity23 to @entity121 in @entity106 , the drought and dry conditions caused by the 1982 - 1983 extreme @entity11 led to the @entity124 in southeast @entity106 , which resulted in 75 deaths			2
the scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme @entity11 events			2
they found a ‘ substantial ’ increase in events from the present - day through the next 100 years as the eastern @entity29 warms in response to global warming			1
professor @entity132 , a co-author from @entity49 , said : ‘ this latest research based on rainfall patterns , suggests that extreme @entity11 events are likely to double in frequency as the world warms leading to direct impacts on extreme weather events worldwide			2
’ ‘ for @entity106 , this could mean summer heat waves , like that recently experienced in the south - east of the country , could get an additional boost if they coincide with extreme @entity2 , ’ he added			0
the impact of this year 's @entity11 events is expected to be felt by every continent			0
during the 1997 to 1998 events , damages were said to have been in the region of between $ 35billion to $ 45billion			2
beachfront homes in @entity152 , @entity153 , pictured , collapsed after two weeks of high surf under @entity11 weather conditions			0

an international team of scientists has predicted a ' substantial ' increase in extreme @entity11 events from the present - day through the next 100 years
an unusually strong @entity11 event occurs every 20 years , but this new research shows this will double to one event every 10 years
the impact of @entity11 events is felt by every continent and the event in 1997 cost between $ 35billion to $ 45billion in damage
