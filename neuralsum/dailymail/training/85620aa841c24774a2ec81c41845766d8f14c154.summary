‘ i was at @entity54 ’s beach in @entity17 on vacation and i think i found your wallet , ’ said @entity43			0
@entity9 was initially thrown by the remark as he had his wallet in his pocket , but then he remembered back to years before - when he was 20 – and he lost a wallet			2
@entity9 ' old atm card : he had forgotten to take his wallet out of his trunks before going water - skiing when @entity43 found the wallet it was very dirty and extremely soggy good samaritan : @entity43 found the wallet whilst walking on @entity16 in @entity17 ‘ my grandparents ( and now my parents as well ) live near @entity16 and one summer we had gone to visit them for our annual vacation at the beach , ’ explained @entity9 , who first posted about the usual experience on @entity70			1
‘ i often water - skied in the @entity77 and one fateful day i had ridden down with my wallet in my swim trunks and had forgotten to take it out before going skiing , ’ he reminisced			2

after giving it a good wash with fresh water , @entity43 noticed that there were several plastic id cards inside			2
he was shocked when the information on the cards revealed that they were from more than 20 years ago			0
‘ i had thought that maybe it might have been a week or two old , but no way did i think it would be 24 years old , ' he told @entity97			0
@entity98 , who lives 80 miles away from the beach in @entity100 , @entity17 , typed the mans ’ name and home town into an internet search engine and quickly found contact details for @entity9			0
the wallet featured a numbers of plastic cards belonging to @entity9 including his first driver 's license @entity21 driver 's license : @entity9 ' first ever driver 's license was found inside the soggy wallet after the pair spoke , @entity114 posted the wallet and all its content back to their rightful owner			1
when @entity9 , who works as a councilor with people suffering from mental health and substance abuse issues , received the package he found the wallet and its contents to be remarkably well - preserved despite having spent more than two decades lost at sea			1
a host of memories came flooding back as he looked again at photos of his teenage self on his first driver 's license and @entity133 ’s for college and high school			1
