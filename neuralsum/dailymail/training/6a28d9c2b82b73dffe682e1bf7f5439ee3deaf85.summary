eight women badminton players have been thrown out of the @entity2 in disgrace for deliberately trying to lose their games			2
yesterday ’s mass disqualification is unprecedented at an @entity2 and followed uproar among 16,000 spectators , who booed their disgust at the players in the @entity10 on tuesday night			2
four pairs – two from @entity13 and one each from @entity15 and @entity16 – went to extraordinary lengths to avoid winning			1
amid shameful and embarrassing scenes , players were deliberately serving into the net or hitting the shuttlecock over the court ’s lines			2
the longest rally in one set lasted just four shots			1
as a furious backlash grew , @entity55 , head of @entity56 , described the players ’ actions as ‘ depressing and unacceptable ’			1
the spotlight will be on the @entity15 , who dominate world badminton but have been accused of manipulation before			1
@entity64 , a @entity65 player who was on an adjacent court at the time of the first match , said @entity15 players routinely tried to avoid playing each other			1
she said : ‘ @entity15 control everything			1
i do n’t know who controlled the match to lose but if it is @entity15 again , they did it so many times last year – they did n’t play against each other in 20 matches			1
they do what they want			2
’ the @entity10 fiasco began when @entity15 top seeds @entity21 and @entity22 started to show little interest in beating @entity83 @entity23 and @entity26 to finish top of @entity85 controversy : @entity87 and @entity88 of @entity16 and @entity89 and @entity90 of @entity13 are threatened with a ' black card ' heated : a coach for @entity16 argues with the tournament referee coming second would have meant avoiding compatriots and second seeds @entity97 and @entity98 until the final			1
the @entity83 responded to @entity15 ’s antics by copying them			1
referee @entity29 warned all the players and produced a black card , meaning they would be disqualified			0
after protests , this was rescinded			0
the match restarted and the @entity83 went on to win 21 - 14 , 21 - 11			0
@entity107 's wry take on the badminton scandal the matter did not end there as a second @entity112 pair , third seeds @entity113 and @entity90 , attempted to engineer defeat in their match against @entity16 ’s @entity88 and @entity87			0
their motive was apparent retaliation to avoid @entity121 and @entity22 in the quarter - finals , an outcome they failed to achieve as they won 18 - 21 , 21 - 14 , 21 - 12			0
the @entity16 were not bystanders in the affair as they responded to the @entity83 by trying to lose themselves			0
@entity126 , the former @entity127 badminton star and @entity2 silver medallist , said : ‘ you can not do this in an @entity2 , this is something that is not acceptable			0
’ miss @entity126 said the potential for match - fixing was raised in a managers ’ meeting on monday but the referee had dismissed concerns			0
she added : ‘ all the managers got together with the referee and said , “ look , this has happened ; in @entity144 you will find some very dodgy matches going on in the evening because of it ” and the referee laughed and said “ do n’t be silly ”			2
‘ the managers said “ we know the game , we know the players and we know the teams and we know this is going to happen ”			2
’ @entity13 ’s coach @entity151 laid the blame squarely at the feet of @entity15			1
he said : ‘ the @entity15 started this			1
they did n’t want to meet each other in the semi-final			0
’ the @entity158 yesterday disqualified the players			0
their places will be taken by the teams who finished third and fourth in their qualifying groups concerned – @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167			0
@entity168 said fans would not be given any refunds , even though some paid up to £ 80 to see the world ’s best players			1
chief executive @entity173 said : ‘ you get in to all sorts of strange precedents if people are n’t satisfied with what they see – it is very grey and dangerous territory			0
’ video : four @entity2 doubles pairs investigated for allegedly trying to lose ...			0
