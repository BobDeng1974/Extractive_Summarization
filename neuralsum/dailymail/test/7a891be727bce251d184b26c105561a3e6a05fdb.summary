@entity0 said the @entity1 was the noisiest atmosphere he had ever experienced during @entity4 ’s derby win over @entity5			1
six days later , silence reigned			2
a sorrowful silence as thousands streamed for the exits in the wake of @entity12 ’s fourth goal inside 14 second - half minutes			1
@entity4 strikers @entity13 and @entity15 ca n't hide their disappointment following defeat a shameful silence as @entity4 ’s players afterwards absorbed the shock of another embarrassing home collapse			1
but perhaps most damning was the sad silence of realisation from @entity25			1
when asked how concerned he was that the side he has inherited are in danger of the drop , he grimaced for fully 10 seconds before returning : ‘ worried ? yes , very worried			1
’ and he has every reason to be			2
@entity4 manager @entity25 looks on as @entity4 are dismantled at home by @entity12 the stands emptied during the second - half at the @entity1 as @entity4 conceded four goals exactly four weeks earlier @entity25 had watched from the comfort of his home in @entity37 as @entity4 trailed 4 - 0 at half - time to @entity39 , a side who had scored just twice on the road all season			1
on saturday , he watched from the discomfort of the touchline as @entity46 trebled his tally for the campaign with a devastating 11 - minute hat - trick			2
the @entity51 forward had earlier laid on the opener for @entity53			2
@entity12 were ruthless and @entity54 , beaten in his last four @entity56 derbies as @entity5 boss , had his revenge			1
@entity46 applauds the travelling fans holding the match ball after helping @entity12 to victory @entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity62 4.5 ; @entity63 5 , @entity64 4 , @entity65 3.5 , @entity66 5 ; @entity67 5 , @entity68 4.5 ( @entity69 64min , 5 ) , @entity70 4.5 ( @entity71 60 , 5 ) ; @entity15 5 , @entity13 5 , @entity72 6			1

super stat : @entity4 have now lost the four matches immediately after their tyne - wear derby victories			1
@entity4 , though , had again given a depressing demonstration of how to surrender a football match			1
when your skipper , @entity65 , is out - fought for a ball with the odds stacked in his favour — as he was for @entity46 ’s second — then you know your problems have permeated the core of the team			0
@entity15 , derby match winner the previous weekend , played as if he had been issued with an exclusion order from the penalty box			0
@entity25 said : ‘ i can see for myself that we do n’t create enough chances even though we play with three strikers			1
even when we play with so many up front we do n’t create anything and that means there is something wrong in the squad			0
‘ we showed we can do something against @entity5 but if we carry on performing like this then we have no chance			0
’ on this evidence , @entity25 is right			2
@entity4 will only be spared relegation by the shortcomings of others			1
they are not capable of saving themselves , as they did in miraculous fashion 12 months ago			0
given that the season finishes with trips to @entity139 and @entity140 they are now working on a four - game rescue plan			0
@entity142 joins an ecstatic @entity46 ( left ) after the forward produced a stunning hat - trick in the second - half for @entity12 and brilliant @entity46 , meanwhile , they are only looking up after four straight wins			2
and the 25 - year - old credited @entity54 following his first senior hat - trick			0
‘ that ( goals ) is what the manager has been demanding from me , ’ he said			0
‘ he has been putting me right in the middle of sessions , even doing the lay - ups for me			0
@entity12 forward @entity142 evades the attention of @entity4 striker @entity13 during the contest ‘ he has put sessions on that have been especially for the strikers , it ’s been excellent			1
’ @entity54 enjoyed seeing his side run riot			2
@entity53 headed them in front before @entity46 executed three swift breakaways			0
a league table from @entity54 ’s time in charge has @entity12 fifth			2
and he added : ‘ we are a pretty young team and only need to add two or three to the squad and we could be a real force next season			0
’ as for next season for @entity4 , they can only hope they ’re in the same division as @entity12			1
@entity25 shakes hands with opposition manager @entity54 knowing his side is in real relegation danger			1

@entity25 warned his side they face relegation if they do n't *improve*
@entity4 were thumped by @entity12 at the @entity1
@entity187 boss @entity25 has admitted he is worried by relegation
@entity4 are three points clear of the @entity192 relegation *zone*
