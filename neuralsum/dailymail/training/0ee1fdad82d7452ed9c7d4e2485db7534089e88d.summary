learning a language has long been known to boost brainpower			2
but a new study suggests the effects extend to those who begin from the age of 10 learning a second language in early childhood has long been known to boost brainpower but a new study suggests that the effects extend to those who learn a language from the age of 10 onwards			1
the research found that people who began learning @entity15 in middle childhood showed improvements in the structure of the brain 's white matter			1
these ' higher levels of structural integrity ' were in areas responsible for language learning and semantic processing			1
the findings mirror observations from previous studies that found these improvements in people who learned a second language at a much earlier age			1
researchers studied brain scans from 20 people , all around the age of 30 , who had lived in @entity38 for at least 13 months			1
they had all started learning @entity15 as a second language around age 10			1
their imaging analyses were compared to 25 people of similar age who spoke only @entity15			2
' everyday handling of more than one language functions as an intensive cognitive stimulation that benefits specific language - related brain structures by preserving their integrity , and therefore it protects them against deterioration in older age , ' said the study led by @entity56 of the @entity57			1
since previous studies had mostly relied on people who learned two or more languages beginning in infancy , scientists say more research is needed to close in on exactly when these positive brain changes begin to take root			2
the research follows a similar study in june which found that @entity68 to speak a second language at any point in your life could help keep your brain sharp as you age , a study suggests			1

previous research had suggested that bilingualism might improve cognition and delay dementia			0
but until now scientists were unsure whether learning a second language improved mental stamina , or whether those with better cognitive functions were more likely to become bilingual .			0
