it ’s easy to let your speed creep upwards when driving on a quiet motorway , but being caught on speed camera can be expensive			0
to solve the problem @entity6 has introduced a setting in its latest car model to stop drivers accidentally exceeding speed limits			2
the built - in device , called the @entity12 , automatically detects road signs and cameras and slows the car down where necessary			1
this image shows the system display on the dashboard , where the maximum speed is set at 50mph ( 80km/h ) it does this by using a windscreen - mounted camera to monitor road signs and when the speed limit is lower than that maximum set speed			1
drivers have to manually set a maximum speed using controls on the steering wheel , so they might choose 70mph ( 113km/h ) for a motorway , for example			1
as speed limit rises , from small roads to highways , the system allows the driver to accelerate up to the set speed , providing it does not exceed the new speed limit , or the maximum limit set by the driver			2
the speed limiter is essentially a variation of a cruise control setting and allows the driver to set a maximum speed for the car			1
the system , in the @entity19 car ( pictured ) is essentially a variation of a cruise control setting and allows the driver to set a maximum speed for the car if the on board technology detects a lower speed limit is in place , on a motorway for example , then it slows the car down to that speed ( illustrated ) and then increases it if and when the limit goes up again the @entity12 can be controlled via controls on the steering wheel			1
drivers manually set a maximum speed			2
the maximum speed is automatically adjusted from the traffic sign recognition system			2
this uses cameras to read road signs and restrictions that are taken on - board by the instrument			2
cars with a built - in @entity79 can also use map data to support the system , particularly on roads where there are few speed signs			0
the system controls speed using engine torque , electronically adjusting the amount of fuel delivered , rather than applying the brakes			2
if the vehicle accelerates past its maximum speed limit on a hill , an alarm sounds so the driver can take action			0
if the on board technology detects a lower speed limit is in place - on a motorway for example - then it slows the car down to that speed and then increases it if and when the limit goes up again			0
the @entity12 communicates with an on - board navigation system to glean extra data in order to help it accurately maintain the appropriate maximum speed when distances between speed limit signs are greater , for example on long country roads			1
@entity6 claims the system could save drivers from picking up speeding tickets or getting pulled over by the police for going too fast			0
‘ drivers are not always conscious of speeding and sometimes only becoming aware they were going too fast when they receive a fine in the mail or are pulled over by law enforcement , ’ said @entity118 safety supervisor , @entity117			0
‘ @entity12 can remove one of the stresses of driving , helping ensure customers remain within the legal speed limit			0
’ the limiter works between speeds of 20mph and 120mph and the speed is reduced by restricting the amount of fuel supplied to the engine , making deceleration smoother			1
the @entity12 communicates with an on - board navigation system to glean extra data in order to help it accurately maintain the appropriate maximum speed when distances between speed limit signs are greater			1
the system is designed to stop people being caught by speed cameras ( stock image ) if the car goes downhill and picks up speed that can not be restricted this way , then an alarm will sound so that the driver can apply more braking			1
drivers can override the system by firmly putting their foot down on the accelerator			0
the @entity12 combines two current @entity6 technologies – the @entity154 and @entity155 , which are available on @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity159 models			0
the @entity19 model can also detect a person or object in the road ahead and slam the brakes on if the driver does not do so themselves			1
@entity6 executive technical leader @entity167 said : ‘ we ’re not just developing cars at @entity6 , we ’re also developing technologies to make driving more convenient , safer , and ultimately help improve mobility around the world			0
’ the @entity173 with the new technology can now be ordered from £ 24,545 .			0

device , called @entity12 comes in the new @entity19 model
drivers set a maximum speed using controls on the steering wheel
cameras detect road signs and speed cameras so the car be slowed down
this is done by restricting the amount of fuel supplied to the engine
system can also detect people and make the car do an *emergency* stop
