the brains of those diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome are distinctly different to those of healthy people , scientists have discovered			0
the study promises to add weight to the debate over the legitimacy of the condition , which is repeatedly called into question			1
a team of researchers at @entity13 believe their findings could lead to more definitive diagnoses of the syndrome and better treatments			2
and it is thought the study could help point to an underlying mechanism governing the disease			0
it is not uncommon for @entity25 patients to face misunderstanding of their condition , plagued by suspicions of hypochondria			1
the brains of those diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome are distinctly different to those of healthy people , scientists have discovered , prompting hopes for better diagnosis and treatment of the condition			1
file picture but the abnormalities identified in this study , published in the journal @entity43 , will , it is hoped , go some way to helping resolve those ambiguities			0
lead author @entity46 , assistant professor of radiology , said : ' this is a very common and debilitating disease			0
' it 's very frustrating for patients , because they feel tired and are experiencing difficulty thinking , and the science has yet to determine what has gone wrong			0
' using a trio of sophisticated imaging methodologies , we found that @entity25 patients ' brains diverge from those of healthy subjects in at least three distinct ways			1
' the condition affects between one and four million in the @entity62 and millions more worldwide			0
putting a definitive figure on the number of sufferers is difficult , because @entity25 can be difficult to diagnose			2
while all patients share a common symptom - crushing , unremitting fatigue that persists for six months or longer - additional symptoms can vary from one patient to the next , often overlapping with other conditions			2
professor @entity72 , the study 's senior author , said : ' @entity25 is one of the greatest scientific and medical challenges of our time			2
' its symptoms often include not only overwhelming fatigue but also joint and muscle pain , incapacitating headaches , food intolerance , sore throat , enlargement of the lymph nodes , gastrointestinal problems , abnormal blood - pressure and heart - rate events , and hypersensitivity to light , noise or other sensations			2
' the combination of symptoms can devastate a patient 's life for decades			0
in an effort to identify the syndrome 's underlying mechanisms , professor @entity72 has been following 200 @entity25 patients for several years			1
' in addition to potentially providing the @entity25 - specific diagnostic biomarker we 've been desperately seeking for decades , these findings hold the promise of identifying the area or areas of the brain where the disease has hijacked the central nervous system , ' he said			1
dr @entity46 added : ' if you do n't understand the disease , you 're throwing darts blindfolded			0
' we asked ourselves whether brain imaging could turn up something concrete that differs between @entity25 patients ' and healthy people 's brains			1
' and , interestingly , it did			0
' the researchers compared brain images of 15 @entity25 patients chosen from the group professor @entity72 has been following , to those of 14 age and sex - matched healthy volunteers			1
the volunteers had no history of fatigue or other conditions causing symptoms similar to those of @entity25			2
their analysis yielded three noteworthy results			0
first , an mri scan showed that overall white matter content of @entity25 patients ' brains was reduced compared to that of healthy participants ' brains			1
researchers at @entity13 found three differences after performing @entity144 on a group of @entity25 patients and a control group of healthy volunteers with no history of @entity25			1
file picture the term ' white matter ' denotes the long , cable - like nerve tracts carrying signals and information through dispersed concentrations of ' grey matter ' - which specialise in processing information			1
while dr @entity46 said the first finding was n't entirely unexpected , the second was			0
using advanced imaging techniques , he and his colleagues identified a consistent abnormality in a particular part of a nerve tract in the right hemisphere of @entity25 patients ' brains			1
the tract , which connects the frontal lobe with the temporal lobe , assumed an abnormal appearance in @entity25 patients			1
furthermore , dr @entity46 said the study identified a strong link between the degree of abnormality in the patient 's tract and the severity of their cfs			2
the third finding highlighted a thickening of the grey matter in the frontal lobe and temporal lobe in @entity25 patients , compared with the control group			1
dr @entity46 said while their results are ' quite robust ' , more research is needed			0
' this study was a start			0
it shows us where to look , ' he said , adding the team are planning a substantially larger study .			0

study at @entity13 examined mri scans of @entity25 patients comparing them to those of healthy volunteers
found three distinct differences in different parts of the brain
@entity25 patients found to have lower levels of white matter - which carries information and signals between different parts of the brain
a tract connecting the frontal and temporal lobes was found to be abnormal
and grey matter - which processes information - in those two areas of the brain was thicker in @entity25 patients
hopes the discovery will lead to better diagnosis and treatment of condition
adds weight to debate over legitimacy of the condition , which is *constantly* questioned and *mistaken* as being hypochondria
