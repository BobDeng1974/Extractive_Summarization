@entity0 smashed a stunning century to set @entity1 on course to take a 2 - 0 lead in their one - day series against @entity6 , although they were given a fright by the home opener @entity9			1
@entity0 , who had top - scored in the low - scoring opening match in @entity11 with 43 , piled into the @entity13 a bowlers on a @entity15 pitch which justified its reputation as a batsmen 's paradise , hitting 13 fours and six sixes after the @entity1 had been put in			1
the @entity22 opener made 141 , his first @entity1 century and his highest score in 50 - over cricket , from only 110 balls before he was dismissed in the 40th over , ending a second - wicket stand of 198 in 26 overs with his captain @entity29			1
