@entity1 's stepfather has said sorry for his controversial and incendiary chants aimed towards the unarmed teen 's supporters the night of the grand jury decision not to indict officer @entity6			1
the apology comes one day after @entity8 police chief @entity8 said that his department was actively pursuing an investigation into whether @entity11 incited the riots that left parts of the city a burning wreck			1
@entity11 issued a statement to the effect that while he was sorry for screaming ' burn this b * * * * down ! ' , to arrest and charge him ' goes way too far and is as wrong as the decision ( of the grand jury ) itself			1
' the victim 's stepfather ( center ) screamed ' burn this b * * * * down ' as he stood next to @entity1 's mother in the seconds after he learned of the grand jury 's decision not to indict officer @entity6 @entity11 , who is married to @entity1 's mother , apologized to those ' who read my pain and anger as a true desire for what i want for our community			1
' he said that he feels he is being unfairly blamed for the chaos that followed his outburst , which was videoed by the @entity44 on november 24 , moments after the grand jury decision came in			1
furthermore , it is understood that @entity11 will not face any charges for his furious invective last monday night , despite @entity8 's revelations on @entity51 at the beginning of the week			1
speaking on monday night 's @entity51 , @entity8 was asked by host @entity53 whether he believed charges should be pressed against @entity11 for his role in the disturbances that evening , posing the question , ' is that inciting a riot ? ' ' something came over me as i watched and listened to my wife , the mother of @entity1 , react to the gut - wrenching news that the cop who killed her son would n't be charged with a crime , my emotions admittedly got the best of me			1
' this is my family			0
i was so angry and full of raw emotions , as so many others were , and granted i screamed out words i should n't have screamed in the heat of the moment			0
i was wrong and i humbly apologize to all those who read my anger and my pain as a true desire for what i want for the community			2
' to place blame solely on me for the conditions of our community and country after the @entity86 decision goes way too far and is wrong as the decision itself			1
to declare a state of emergency and send a message of war , not peace , before a @entity86 decision is announced is also wrong			1
' in the end i 've lived in this community for a long time			0
the last thing i truly wanted was to see it go up in flames			0
in spite of my frustration , it really hurt me to see that			2
it 's time to rebuild			0
