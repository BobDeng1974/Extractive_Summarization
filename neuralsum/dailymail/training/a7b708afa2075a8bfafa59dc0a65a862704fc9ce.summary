by @entity1 reporter published : 08:23 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 14:28 est , 11 june 2013 a 20 - day - old baby born with a deadly aneurysm has been saved with the help of superglue			1
it all started when @entity7 , born may 16 , went from quiet all the time to screaming and throwing up			1
‘ at that point , ’ says mom @entity8 , ‘ you know something ’s not right			0
fearing the worst , @entity7 ’s parents rushed the tiny girl to @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
that ’s where an ultra-sound uncovered something lurking inside her brain			2
@entity23 ... @entity24 : 20 - day - old @entity7 was saved when doctors improvised a way to close her aneurysm , rarely seen in infants , using surgical super glue ‘ [ that ’s ] as far as we made it because they saw something in her head at that point in time , so they decided to transfer her to a hospital that was better equipped for what was going on , ’ @entity30 told @entity31			1
the decision turned out to be a smart one , but no one could have known that the moment doctors at the second hospital diagnosed @entity7 with an almond - sized aneurysm in her brain			1
the condition , very rarely seen in infants , is far more common in adults , leaving doctors in uncharted waters			2
‘ we did not know what the right answer was			0
this was not a textbook case , ’ said dr. @entity55 , an endovascular neurosurgeon			0
unknowns : rare in infants , the discovery of an aneurysm in @entity7 's tiny brain , center , meant doctors were in uncharted territory dr. @entity55 said the aneurysm was unlikely to close on its own and that most babies would n’t survive an aneurysm left untreated			1
‘ so we had a strong reason to develop a plan to close the aneurysm , ’ he said			2
unfortunately , because the condition is so rare in infants , there were no designated tools for the job			1
after imaging the aneurysm using an angiogram , which allows doctors to view the body ’s blood vessels , dr. @entity55 decided on his course of action : he would close the aneurysm using surgical superglue			2
decision time : dr. @entity55 ( left , with @entity7 's mother @entity8 ) knew most babies would n't survive on their own with the condition , but there were no prescribed methods to save her , either improvised tools : dr. @entity55 used a micro-catheter as thin as a hair to administer surgical glue , fishing it through @entity7 's neck and into her brain , none of which had been done on an infant before @entity7 ’s prognosis was impossible to determine			1
no one had ever used superglue on a baby in that way before			0
there was n’t even a designated tool for the job			0
dr. @entity55 decided to use a tiny , hair thin micro-catheter to administer the daring treatment			0
going in through the baby ’s neck , the doctors accessed the aneurysm and deposited the glue			0
but they did n’t have to wait long			0
doctors were able to remove @entity7 ’s breathing tube the very next day			1
‘ i did not know that she 'd be ready that fast , ’ said the thrilled doctor			0
@entity7 ’s relieved parents will likely be able to take their little girl , who doctors say will be just fine , home in a week or so			2
relief : @entity7 's parents , pictured , were as shocked as doctors when the 20 - day - old girl began to recover almost immediately			1
they will take her home in a week or so			0

20 - day - old @entity7 was born with an almond - sized aneurysm on her brain , an extremely rare condition in an infant
