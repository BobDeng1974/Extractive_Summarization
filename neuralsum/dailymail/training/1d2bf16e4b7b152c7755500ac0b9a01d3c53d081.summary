@entity0 is everywhere i look			1
his wobbly features leer from several dozen framed photographs and press clippings that smother the walls of his teeny mews house in @entity9 ’s @entity8			2
there ’s him with @entity11 , him smoking an enormous cigar and him next to an even more enormous pair of fake breasts			2
most terrifying of all , though , is an oversize papier mâché effigy of the former @entity19 pundit , complete with trademark deerstalker hat , gleaming white teeth and flailing tongue			1
there ’s just one photograph of long - suffering wife @entity25 , partly hidden behind a rubber plant			1
support : @entity28 , wife of the former @entity19 horse - racing pundit @entity30 , thinks claims her husband is sexist are ' stupid ' he has never been very nice about her and famously calls her ‘ @entity37 ’ , because like the @entity35 bird , he claims she ’s ‘ stupid , squawks a lot and was easy to catch ’			1
but the women who emerges from an upstairs bedroom is surprisingly attractive ; glamorous even			2
she has a lovely figure , an enviable pair of pins and looks much younger than her 68 years			1
how on earth this seemingly sane woman has managed 42 long years with racing ’s favourite bigot is anyone ’s guess			1
yet not only does she defend the apparently indefensible , she does so with a matter - of - fact directness that makes the true situation all - too - clear : she is an integral part of team @entity0 and its success for the past 30 years – the straight man to her husband ’s comic turn			1
case : @entity0 , pictured outside the @entity59 , in central @entity9 , believes the channel and tv production company @entity60 sacked him because of his age ‘ oh , all that sexism stuff is absolutely stupid , ’ @entity25 says , in a thick @entity65 twang			2
‘ people ask how i could be married to him , but @entity30 ’s not like that in real life			1
he ’s actually very generous , kind and extremely hard - working			1
ask any of his friends , they ’ll tell you			2
’ the bosses of @entity19 , however , have taken a different view			1
indeed , the 73 - year - old ’s well - established ‘ routine ’ was last week cited as the reason he was axed from the channel ’s racing team last year			1
during an employment tribunal , which ended last monday , the pundit ’s former tv bosses rubbished his claim that he was ‘ culled ’ because of his age and said that his ‘ irritating comedy act ’ was over-dramatic , and liable to offend			1
viewers wanted serious journalists and a more up - market programme			1
@entity19 ’s claim has incensed @entity25 , who has been driven to speak for the first time since the controversy began			1
‘ i do n’t know what they ’re going on about , ’ she says , angrily			2
‘ he was encouraged to behave outrageously on celebrity @entity93 and @entity94			2
‘ he also did the @entity95 and was supposed to do @entity96			2
but it was @entity19 who kept asking him to do these things for them			1
if they hated his act so much , why did they want him ? ‘ it never stopped him from being a serious journalist			1
he ’s won press awards and has written for newspapers for years			1
’ @entity25 adds : ‘ look , i know @entity30 ’s getting older , but you can still work when you ’re 73			2
look at @entity107 [ who ’s 85 ] and @entity108 [ 63 ] they ’re not young , but they can still do the job			2
’ it was a phone call last october that saw the end of the @entity115 ’ world as they knew it			2
@entity30 had been in @entity117 on a solo holiday when he was told by @entity19 ’s commissioning editor for sport , @entity119 , that his contract was not being renewed after nearly three decades in the job			1
‘ rumours were circulating that the older people would be axed and younger ones brought in , ’ @entity25 says			1
‘ @entity30 could n’t believe it			2
he had been the face of @entity128 for so long			2
facade : mr @entity0 's wife @entity25 has supported in through the tribunal and says her husband is ' actually very generous , kind and extremely hard - working ‘ they told him just half an hour before they put out a press release , ’ she adds , getting teary			1
‘ he was terribly , terribly upset and could n’t believe they could do that to him after so many years			1
it was pure cruelty on their part			2
‘ people might say it was just a job , but to us , it was our whole lives			2
we worked so hard together			1
i used to get up at 4am to get the papers from @entity148 so @entity30 could do a paper review			2
we built our life around it and @entity19 has destroyed that life			1
’ @entity25 admits the stress has made them both ill. earlier this year @entity30 was rushed to hospital after collapsing at @entity156 , while she has had chest pains			1
since his sacking , @entity30 ’s regular work has amounted to a twice - monthly stint on sunday forum , a chat show on the @entity163 , and he was seen last week on the @entity165 show @entity164 , arranging a couple ’s wedding with @entity169 singer @entity168			1
controversy : @entity0 , pictured posing with ladies on @entity172 at @entity173 , was axed from @entity19 because of his irritating comedy act , according to tv bosses it seems his well - established reputation as a sexist is perhaps too far ingrained on potential employers ’ minds			1
he got into hot water for calling @entity128 sidekick @entity182 ‘ @entity183 ’ and was scolded by former @entity128 presenter @entity184 for trying to nickname her ‘ @entity186 ’			0
during celebrity big brother he called fellow housemate caprice ‘ @entity189 ’			0
despite this , @entity25 is quick to defend her man			0
experience : the 73 - year - old has been a broadcast journalist for 35 years , working for @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity19 ‘ if you say somebody is a slag or something , well that ’s horrible			1
but @entity30 ’s names were all nice , ’ she says , adding that he would not use the names if the women objected			0
she is so fond of her own moniker that it appears on her business card			0
‘ i really do n’t get offended by @entity37 and do n’t find it objectionable , ’ @entity25 says			0
‘ to me , it ’s more a term of endearment			0
’ @entity25 first met @entity30 at a party in 1970			1
he has claimed he was first attracted to her yellow @entity213 , @entity214 , but took her on because she was attached to the end of his lead			0
if makes you wonder what exactly attracted @entity25 to @entity30			0
‘ some people like boring people who go through life with no opinions and do n’t antagonise people			0
well , i do n’t like boring people			0
say what you like about @entity30 , but he was never boring			0
my parents did n’t like him at all			0
but look , i am happy ! if i was n’t , i would leave him			0
’ and what of @entity30 ’s claims to have been something of a sexual athlete in the past ? ‘ ridiculous ! ’ @entity25 shrieks , making the sleeping cat jump			1
‘ it ’s a joke ! anyway sex is not something i ’m going to discuss			0
i know @entity30 would , but he ’s just being silly			0
he said that to be outrageous			0
’ earlier this year @entity25 showed her steelier side when she told @entity30 off for discussing his penchant for big breasts with a female interviewer			0
‘ @entity30 thought it was a joke , but i did n’t , ’ she says with a sniff			0
‘ he said what does it matter , but it does matter because that ’s not the truth , he ’s putting on an act			1
i was worried he would n’t be taken seriously during the tribunal as a result			0
’ the couple now face an agonising wait for the panel to reach its decision , which could take weeks			0
@entity30 is suing for £ 500,000 in lost earnings and £ 2.5million in damages			0
‘ i ’m furious about the tribunal because it has become so expensive , ’ says @entity25			0
‘ but we ’re lucky , we own two houses in @entity8 [ one of @entity9 ’s most expensive residential areas – she admits the homes are worth several million ] and do n’t have any children to pay for			0
if we lose we wo n’t face ruin , but at the same time i do n’t have that sort of money sitting in a bank			0
‘ that said , i was n’t wary about doing the tribunal at all			0
@entity30 felt the only way he could move forward was to do this			0
i have to respect him for that			0
he has been treated appallingly			0
we ’re talking about @entity19			1
they ’re supposed to hold a flag for integrity , diversity and fairness			0
‘ if we lose we ’ll carry on in the knowledge that @entity30 did the best he could			0
if we win , we ’ll do the same , but no amount of money can ever make up for what @entity19 has done			1
@entity30 will never get over it			0

says he is ' actually very generous , kind and extremely hard - working '
