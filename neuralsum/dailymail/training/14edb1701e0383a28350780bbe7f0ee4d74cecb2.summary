think @entity0 crossed with @entity1 , with just a hint of @entity3 in the mix , and you 've got @entity6			1
as real - life wheelers and dealers go , they do n't really come bigger than this , certainly not if we 're talking actual wheel size - because @entity6 buys and sells military merchandise , big tanks mostly			1
and his tanks are stars			1
you 've probably seen some of them in war films such as @entity20			1
@entity6 ( centre ) is described as the @entity0 of military vehicles @entity23 on location in @entity25 filming @entity28 movie ' @entity26 ' , pictured with one of @entity6 's tanks @entity23 getting to grips with his tank , on location filming @entity26 , set during @entity28 ' all those big important scenes when they blow up the tanks in private @entity20 - those were my babies , ' he says proudly			1
was he on site ? of course he was			1
' i make a point of being there for something like that			1
these are historic vehicles , worth tens of thousands of pounds			1
i 'm there to make sure that when a director says , " blow it up ! " no one takes him too literally			1
' he has ' taught tanks ' - if you can do such a thing - to the best in the business			1
' @entity56 ( who starred in @entity20 ) was surprisingly knowledgeable			1
he 's quite a buff himself , and a real gentleman , with a passion for history			1
' and @entity23 ( who 's recently been filming @entity28 blockbuster fury ) knows his motorbikes			2
he 's got a real collection			2
whenever i 'm on set with people like that they 're always interested in hearing what i have to say			2
' @entity6 is coming out of the shadows for his own starring role in a new series called @entity73 @entity56 and his troops taking on one of @entity6 's tanks in @entity20 @entity6 , originally from @entity77 but now based in @entity78 , is coming out of the film world shadows for his own starring role soon - at the helm of a new series called @entity83 , tracking his journey across the world hunting for rare and eye - wateringly valuable military memorabilia			1
it 's a kind of @entity89 with guns , which might sound like a curious idea for a tv series but as it happens is quite a riot - mostly thanks to @entity6 's penchant for pink trousers teamed with tan leather jackets			1
it 's not too macho either			2
yes there 's quite a bit of footage of weapons experts trying not to blow their own feet off , and a man who thinks he 's @entity103 trying , and failing , to get to grips with a wartime @entity106			1
but since he ends up wrapping it around a tree , it does n't take itself too seriously			2
@entity6 is a former paratrooper himself but his passion for all things military started at a young age			1
' i had an @entity114 with a tommy gun at the age of seven , and there was no turning back			2
' by 11 he had his first bona fide piece of history in his hands in the form of a @entity124 helmet			2
' i walked past a house on the way to school every day and noticed that there were daffodils planted in this upturned helmet			2
i was obsessed by it			2
@entity6 has been collecting war memorabilia since the age of 11 ' on the last day of primary school i plucked up the courage to ask the owner if i could buy it off him			1
he tipped the daffodils out and said , " have it "			2
i 've never forgotten that feeling			2
once i 'd got a @entity124 helmet , i wanted a @entity143 one			2
then i started picking up gas masks , berets … that 's how it started			2
' it was n't designed as a business venture , but when he came into a job lot of gas masks and sold a few on he began to realise he could make a living from doing what he loves			1
now he employs a team of experts , and together they scour the world for increasingly rare examples of wartime memorabilia			1
' there 's still an awful lot of stuff out there , ' he says			2
' we 're finding interesting things in @entity166 at the minute , and @entity167 is fascinating			2
the big markets are in @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 , where collectors are willing to pay hundreds of thousands for a piece - maybe £ 200,000 or £ 300,000 for a tank			2
' which they , er , drive around their big gardens ? ' some do , yes			2
for some , these are just playthings			0
but the serious collectors have entire collections , museums			0
' what 's the attraction for @entity6 ? ' it 's about holding this piece of history , imagining the piece of equipment as it was , taking it apart to restore it			1
sometimes you can piece together the entire story : learn about the person who would have sat in the vehicle , who perhaps died in it			0
you can touch the bullet holes			0
' he often displays his vehicles at fairs and shows - and has worked with veterans who know more than he will ever do about what it was like to operate the machines			0
' that can be incredibly moving			0
' so how does one go about acquiring a @entity28 military vehicle ? the first episode shows us			0
it features @entity6 charging off to @entity209 in pursuit of something called a @entity213 - ' basically a @entity124 vehicle that 's not much more than a bathtub on wheels '			1
@entity6 does n't speak a word of @entity217 ( ' it 's amazing how far you can get with hand gestures ' ) , but against all the odds he finds himself in a dusty old garage gazing in disbelief at the very vehicle he was looking for after seeing it in an old photograph			1
@entity6 's tanks have appeared in films such as @entity20 frankly , it looks like a rusty old pile of junk			1
' ah , well , i 'd call it more rusty gold , ' he says , the thrill still palpable			0
' @entity236 were basically amphibious cars used by the @entity124 , and i have a photograph of one taken in august 1944 , after the @entity239			0
' this post d - day battle is not as widely known as others from the period , such as those at @entity244 and @entity245 , but experts believe it marked a key stage in the war , offering proof that the @entity251 could beat off heavy @entity124 counter-attacks			0
this particular @entity253 is highly prized , says @entity6			1
' the proof of its history - the photograph with its markings - sends the value through the roof			0
' the startling fact , of course , is that this priceless piece of history has been gathering dust in a farmer 's barn for the past 70 years			0
little wonder @entity6 is almost in tears as he 's led to it and allowed to examine it			1
' i have n't been this excited since my wedding night , ' he says			0
alas , the @entity276 - type ending to this story does n't happen			0
the farmer , who does n't seem remotely impressed by the fact he 's dealing with a man who knows @entity56 , says a categoric ' non , monsieur ' when @entity6 offers to buy it			1
@entity6 recently supplied tanks for the filming of the film fury			1
he arranged for an entire fleet of them to be transported from his home in @entity78 to the set in @entity290 - at the cost of a cool £ 3 million the cameras capture @entity6 becoming more and more frantic as he ups the price			1
what 's it actually worth ? ' the sky 's the limit , ' he concludes , pointing out that bog - standard @entity299 , without this proven pedigree , can go for in excess of £ 120,000			0
but monsieur is not for budging , and @entity6 is forced to leave empty - handed			1
' it 's tragic , ' he concludes			0
' but at least i know it 's there			0
i know that this is my business , but the real passion for me is in the hunt			1
' with an eye on the profit sheet , though , he quickly finds - and snaps up for , gulp , £ 70,000 - another @entity253 , with the hope of restoring it and showing it in a military display			0
what happens when he gets this model home to his workshop ? well , it 's revealed to have myriad leaks , of course			0
on the day he 's due to sail it across a lake , even he is questioning his sanity			0
' this could sink , ' he says , as water starts to pour in			0
' if it does , i might as well have thrown the £ 70,000 in the lake			0
' @entity83 starts on 30 april , 10pm on quest the money changing hands in this business is truly spectacular			0
@entity6 has recently supplied tanks for the filming of the @entity23 film @entity26			1
he arranged for an entire fleet of them to be transported from his home in @entity78 to the set in @entity290 - at the cost of a cool £ 3 million			0
' they wanted some original @entity124 vehicles - that 's like trying to find 20 fabergé eggs			0
then you have the costs of security and transportation			0
authenticity does n't come cheap			0
' at home he 's known locally as @entity359 and his antics prove to be quite the talking point			0
' every year i do a military show in @entity364 and they actually send the @entity366 over to collect the vehicles			0
that causes quite a stir in my sleepy little village			0
' and what does his wife make of his passion ? ' well , she does n't share it			1
we have special storage facilities for all the tanks and she insists that the smaller stuff , and all my research papers , stay out of the house			1
but she can drive a tank			0
she sometimes has to load and unload them if i 'm away on a trip , so she 's quite good at it			0
it 's a handy skill to have			0
' @entity83 starts on wednesday 30 april at 10pm on @entity387 ( @entity389 channel 38 )			0
