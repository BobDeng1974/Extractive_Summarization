beleaguered : pastor @entity7 , the founder of @entity9 megachurch , wrote online that women were created to give homes to men 's penises			1
he has stepped down pending an investigation into his conduct ' the first thing to know about your penis is , that despite the way it may see , it is not your penis , ' he wrote			0
' ultimately , @entity34 created you and it is his penis			0
you are simply borrowing it for a while			0
' while his penis is on loan you must admit that it is sort of just hanging out there very lonely as if it needed a home , sort of like a man wondering the streets looking for a house to live in			2
' knowing that his penis would need a home , @entity34 created a woman to be your wife and when you marry her and look down you will notice that your wife is shaped differently than you and makes a very nice home			2
' he then continued with his analogy to say men must not cheat or masturbate			2
' though you may believe your hand is shaped like a home , it is not , ' he wrote			0
' and , though women other than your wife may look like a home , to rest there would be breaking into another man ’s home			2
' as she shared a screenshot of the messages on her blog , @entity16 added : ' i have rarely seen an evangelical man assert male superiority and prominence this directly			0
' she added : ' in @entity7 's treatment , women are no more than penis homes			1
women were created to satisfy men			2
there is nothing uplifting or honored in that			0

last year , an evangelical radio host accused @entity7 of plagiarizing some passages in one of his books , a call to @entity182 , claiming they were largely stolen from another text			1
the church was then accused of getting a company to buy up one of his books , manipulating sales figures and boosting the book so that it appeared on the @entity190			1
in another scandal , the church also admitted that money they said was being used to start church overseas were actually being used for expenses at @entity196 churches			0
