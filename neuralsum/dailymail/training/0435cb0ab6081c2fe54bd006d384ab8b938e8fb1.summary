by @entity0 for @entity1 designer rental is big business - and it 's all thanks to @entity5			0
social media is fuelling the rise in multiple dress hire firms opening in the @entity10 and @entity11 ; even couture hire for children , @entity14			0
bosses say women feel like they ca n't wear the same thing twice if their friends have seen it online , and that every girl deserved that ' @entity21 experience '			1
the fairytale illusion and one - upmanship the internet promotes means fashionistas are feeling like they need to show off a new designer outfit for every big night out or day at the races			1
but many ca n't afford the price tag			1
so companies such as @entity42 in the @entity10 and @entity43 in the @entity11 are offering a solution , by letting you rent out a top end dress for the price of a cab ride instead			1
@entity49 , co-founder of @entity42 , says @entity5 can be blamed for the rising demand - whether it is for a teenager at a school prom or thirty - something at a summer wedding			2
' we provide millions of women with the ability to rent designer dresses and accessories for a fraction of the retail price , ' she tells the @entity62			2
fashionistas on a budget want to show off a new designer outfit - but many ca n't afford to buy one ' our customers are all over the @entity10 , in towns , and in the countryside where they do n't have access to the shops			1
' it 's exactly like @entity73 : you shop on our website and the dresses get delivered in a box to your door			0
' @entity79 got the idea for the company while working as a pr manager for @entity84 luxury brand @entity83 , where she would lend dresses and accessories to magazines and celebrities - and she says everybody deserves a ' @entity21 experience '			0
established dress rental company @entity43 , meanwhile , boasts more than 65,000 dresses ready to hire and provides a seamless dry cleaning service available to women all over the @entity11			2
the number of dresses it has rented out has doubled in each of the last two years , putting it on course for sales of £ 61.3m ( $ 100m ) this year			0
' we 're giving our customer access to things she would n't have otherwise purchased , either because it was n't smart to buy it or she could n't afford it , ' @entity43 's co-founder @entity106 told @entity107			1
the ability to recycle favourite dresses is being curtailed by sites such as @entity111 and @entity5 , which is fuelling the rental boom			0
' it creates pressure for women , ' says @entity116			0
' now you ca n't repeat outfits because your friends have seen that outfit on social media			1
as ridiculous as that sounds , that is what drives our business			0

women feel they ca n't wear the same thing if friends have seen it online
many ca n't afford to buy a new designer outfit every weekend
sites like @entity42 and @entity43 let them rent instead
