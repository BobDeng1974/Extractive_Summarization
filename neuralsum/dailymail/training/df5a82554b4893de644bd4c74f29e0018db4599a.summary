by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 18:17 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 04:39 est , 14 october 2013 dr @entity2 said the @entity4 scandal would not have been exposed without the @entity5 and a free press a leading medical figure who helped abolish the @entity4 has praised the @entity5 ’s campaign as he condemned attempts to fetter the free press			1
dr @entity2 – who persuaded ministers to set up the official inquiry that led to the demise of the @entity4 – said : ‘ we would never have got it off the ground if it had not been for the @entity5 and the @entity11			1
i am very concerned about @entity17 and anything which might endanger it			1
’ dr @entity2 spoke in the wake of the proposal by ministers that newspapers should accept a new regulator which gives mps a final say in how regulation should work			1
newspapers are thought likely to reject the plan by culture secretary @entity32 because they fear it would give politicians power to censor and intimidate the press			2
dr @entity2 , a prominent paediatrician , praised the @entity5 in a speech at the @entity38 on saturday			1
he said the @entity11 had stood up for truth while the @entity40 and the medical profession closed ranks to try to silence criticism of the @entity4			1
‘ had it not been for the press , the relatives who have suffered would not have been able to link up and get their stories heard , ’ dr @entity2 said			1
‘ that ’s why you need a free press			2
’ during the summer the government changed its mind and abolished the @entity4 following the verdict of @entity55 ’s inquiry			1
the inquiry found patients and their families were suffering ‘ poor care , appalling communications and of a lack of attention or compassion ’			2
the inquiry was set up after the @entity5 made a series of damaging disclosures about the system , which had been introduced across the @entity69 hospital network , and which was meant to provide dignity and comfort to patients in their last hours of life			1
the government abolished the @entity4 after an inquiry into standards of care prompted by the @entity5 's investigations ( file picture ) this newspaper highlighted the disquiet of senior doctors who thought the @entity4 was being used to get rid of elderly patients and free up hospital beds			1
we reported the agony of families whose loved ones had died , usually after being drugged and refused liquids			2
the @entity5 also revealed the ‘ bribe ’ system under which hospitals were paid millions in bonus money in return for hitting targets for numbers of patients dying on the @entity4			1
the official inquiry said in july that desperate patients were being denied water and there were suspicions that patients had been ‘ hastened towards death ’ for financial reasons			2
it said the @entity4 should be abolished			1
dr @entity2 , a member of the @entity107 which campaigns against euthanasia and abortion , was one of two senior medical figures who persuaded @entity112 health minister @entity111 to establish the @entity114 inquiry			1
he said : ‘ in this business we have come up against the entire establishment – the government , the @entity119 , the bulk of the medical profession , all closing ranks – and we came in for a fair amount of stick for having actually questioned the @entity4			1
newspapers are thought likely to reject the regulation plan by culture secretary @entity32 ( pictured )			0
dr @entity2 expressed concern at any rules that would impinge on the @entity17 ‘ but had it not been for the press , the relatives who have suffered would not have been able to link up and get their stories heard			1
‘ and their stories were absolutely dreadful – people were dying of thirst , people were being rendered unconscious unnecessarily , some very emotionally upsetting things were happening			0
that ’s why you need a free press			0
’ dr @entity2 spoke as he received the @entity140 from disability rights campaigner @entity141 for his work to expose the effects of the @entity4			1
he added : ‘ the @entity145 published a report that most gps supported the @entity4 , but the @entity11 were publishing more and more stories of awful deaths			2
‘ if i may say so , the demented elderly who were in great danger from the misapplication of the @entity4 , are now in a safer place			2
we must all acknowledge the importance of the @entity11 in all of this from their first description of the so - called “ death pathway ”			0
’ dr @entity2 told the @entity5 yesterday : ‘ the medical establishment were trying to silence criticism			1
health minister @entity111 called the @entity4 a ' national disgrace ' the medical profession condemned the @entity5 ’s disclosures about the @entity166 string of professional bodies and charities combined with @entity69 managers to form a front to isolate and shout down our coverage of the @entity4			1
on september 24 last year , 22 organisations , including professional associations and the @entity175 , united to issue a ‘ consensus statement ’ endorsing the @entity4			2
‘ published misconceptions and often inaccurate information about the @entity4 risk detracting from the substantial benefits it can bring to people who are dying and their families , ’ it said			2
on october 18 , @entity185 council chairman dr @entity184 said : ‘ the @entity185 is appalled at the media coverage in the @entity5 and elsewhere about planning for end - of - life care			1
' as well as being inaccurate and deliberately misleading , this coverage is creating unnecessary distress and fear for patients who might be nearing the end of their life and for their families			0
’ the @entity194 , which describes itself as ‘ one of the world ’s leading medical journals ’ , said : ‘ the reporting of the story has been appalling			0
’ in july this year , the inquiry set up by the @entity201 found the treatment of many patients on the @entity4 had been ‘ uncaring , rushed and ignorant ’ and called for its abolition			1
health minister @entity111 agreed , saying : ‘ this is not civilised			0
it is a national disgrace			0
’ on the day the inquiry reported , dr @entity184 put out a new statement , saying her @entity38 ‘ supports the move away from the end - of - life pathway ’ and adding : ‘ we have expressed concern about the implementation of the @entity4			1
’ ‘ they were not willing to contemplate any possible criticism			0
i can remember one chap from a @entity38 telling me that he knew hospital registrars were getting it wrong , but that was no reason for them to change their minds			0
’ dr @entity2 , who retired last year after serving as a hospital paediatrician in @entity226 and @entity227 , spoke as the row over press regulation appeared to be reaching a crisis			1
ministers have rejected a proposal for self - regulation put forward by newspapers that would incorporate the recommendations of @entity236 in his inquiry into the culture , practice and ethics of the press			2
they prefer a system agreed by the political parties in a late night meeting in the offices of @entity247 leader @entity246 , at which several representatives of the @entity250 campaign group hacked off were present , but no representative of the newspaper industry			0
the regulation method proposed by @entity256 would be imposed by @entity257			0
it would allow the system to be amended by a two thirds majority in @entity261			0
newspapers have indicated they will reject the scheme , which would mean statutory controls on the @entity11 for the first time in 300 years			0
documents from @entity267 leaked by @entity269 fugitive @entity268 ( pictured ) were reportedly copied on to a usb memory stick and sent by @entity271 the @entity273 newspaper reportedly sent top - secret files to the @entity269 by household courier @entity271 in a move security experts branded ‘ astonishing ’			0
former anti-terror law watchdog @entity277 said the suggestion that the paper used the courier may have put the lives of @entity284 spies in danger			0
he said : ‘ i think it is astonishing that top - secret material has been placed in a public parcel delivery system			0
’ he also called on the attorney general to consider legal action against the newspaper and accused the @entity273 of playing a ‘ parlour game ’ with national security			0
last week , the head of @entity295 warned that publishing confidential documents handed a ‘ gift ’ to terrorists and caused harm to the work of security services			0
security chiefs are ‘ very concerned ’ at the reported use of the courier service			2
a source said : ‘ any leak like this is extremely concerning and part of that concern is the handling arrangements			0
’ documents from @entity267 , the government ’s secret listening post , leaked by @entity269 fugitive @entity268 , were reportedly copied on to a usb memory stick and sent by @entity271			0
last night , the @entity273 refused to say how the material was sent .			0

dr @entity2 persuaded mps to launch inquiry into @entity4
said they would not have been *successful* in ending it without @entity5
said he is ' very concerned about endangering @entity17 '
