by @entity0 he 's famous for his exposés of the seedy side of @entity5 life , interviewing everyone from porn stars to pet obsessives in a bid to shine a light on the parts of @entity12 where the cameras do n't go			1
now @entity14 has turned his attentions to a completely different part of @entity5 life - the dying - and unearthed an incredible survival story in the process			1
when @entity14 first met @entity19 , 22 , he was in a coma and not expected to survive			1
but 37 days later and in the face of overwhelming odds of a million to one , the college athlete woke up			2
new direction : @entity14 goes behind the scenes at @entity5 's @entity26 to explore the dying process ' i was amazed , ' reveals @entity14			1
' the doctors had repeatedly told us – and told his family – that the best - case scenario for him would be that he remained in a vegetative state			2
best case ! ' so to have him wake up and walk again and converse normally was mind - blowing			2
i remember being in the office when my director came off the phone from @entity19 ’s sister and said he ’d woken up			1
i did n’t believe him			0
' it just goes to show , doctors do n’t know everything			0
seeing him reunited with his twin brother after he woke up was one of the most moving things i ’ve ever seen			0
' so how did a 22 - year - old athlete come to be in a coma ? the answer is a drug overdose that left him with severely compromised liver and kidney function and traumatic brain damage			1
doctors at @entity5 's @entity26 were convinced that the damage was too severe to make recovery possible and had told the family that it would be better to let him go			1
harrowing : @entity19 in hospital with his @entity62 and @entity63			1
doctors were convinced he would n't survive survivor : incredibly , and against all odds , @entity19 woke up after 37 days in a coma the family , by contrast , were equally convinced that he would survive and their faith was rewarded when after more than a month , he opened his eyes			1
' i 'm grateful and i 'm thankful to @entity74 , ' his delighted sister @entity73 tells @entity14 , ' but i knew he was going to get better - i knew he was going to be ok			1
' that optimism is at the heart of @entity14 's new film , @entity78 : @entity79 ; an optimism that sees doctors , families and patients continuing to treat patients long after they would have been dispatched to a hospice in the @entity86			1
' it ’s the nature of the way healthcare is funded in @entity90 , ' explains @entity14			2
' if you have insurance , then beyond a certain threshold of cost , everything is covered , with virtually no upper limit			0
' so there is a temptation to try everything			0
which in some ways is good because there are so many options available			0
' but it ’s also the case that , given the vast amounts the @entity90 spends on healthcare ( compared with other industrialised nations ) , the @entity90 life expectancy is not what it should be			2
' and while @entity19 manages a miraculous recovery , the other severely ill stars of the show ; @entity113 , a 31 - year - old with rectal cancer and @entity116 , a 29 - year - old suffering from leukaemia ; do not			1
' i knew they were at a high risk of dying soon , ' explains @entity14			2
' it was deeply affecting to see them live through some of the most dramatic and upsetting experiences of their lives			0
' but , as strange as it may sound , both @entity113 and @entity116 took strength from having the camera there as a witness to their struggle			1
miracle : @entity19 with his mother @entity136 and sister @entity137 - neither of whom ever gave up hope ' i 'm good ' : what @entity19 , pictured with twin brother @entity140 , when he returned to thank them ' @entity113 had always worked on the fringes of show business and he loved the idea of being on a mainstream tv programme			1
he wrote glowingly about it on @entity147			0
' and @entity116 seemed to appreciate having someone from " the outside " talking to him about what he was going through			2
' the tale of the two men also illustrates the differences between end - of - life care in the @entity90 and the @entity86 ; not least in terms of the amount of money involved			1
in @entity113 's case , the treatment he received in hospital cost more than $ 2 million - a lot , you might imagine , for what ultimately turned out to be a futile attempt to save him			1
so is it right to spend so much on one man that could have been put to use elsewhere ? @entity14 finds the question a tough one to answer			2
' he had a massive amount of surgery to remove his anal cancer – which had spread to his liver , ' he muses			2
' this was a long - shot procedure , especially given that he had a weakened immune system			0
his recovery was slow and painful , and in fact his wound never healed , which contributed to his death			0
not so lucky : @entity116 , who also appears in @entity14 ' film , in happier times before succumbing to leukaemia last moments : @entity116 married his girlfriend a few days before he died ; a moment captured in the documentary ' it seems to me that – in a world of finite resources – it was n’t the best use of the two million			1
but i try to put myself in @entity113 ’s position and i can understand the motivation to get it done , and likewise the doctor ’s urge to do the best for @entity113			2
' questions about morality and money aside , at heart , the film is about death and how people deal with it - whether that 's staving it off for as long as they can or accepting it			2
parts are quite simply heart - breaking : the moment when @entity113 sobs after being told that nothing more can be done for him or when @entity116 marries his girlfriend in a bedside ceremony			1
ultimately , it 's oddly uplifting both because of @entity113 and @entity116 's bravery and because of @entity19 's dramatic recovery			1
after 37 days in intensive care and seven weeks in rehab , the man who everyone thought would end his life as a vegetable strides , beaming , back into the hospital to thank the staff who saved his life			1
' i 'm good , ' he tells the doctor			0
proof that , for all its perceived flaws , the @entity90 health system can provide some lucky families with miracle			0
@entity14 's @entity78 : @entity233 , sunday night at 9pm on @entity234 he 's no stranger to the weird and wonderful and now @entity14 is to tackle one of the weirdest and most wonderful religions of them all - scientology			1
' @entity237 is the quintessential @entity12 religion , ' he explains			0
' i ’ve been trying to make [ the film ] for years and now we ’ve got funding to do it as a feature documentary film			0
' i just put out an appeal on @entity244 for @entity245 to speak to me for the film			0
they tend not to do much media so we ’ll have to wait and see what comes back			0
' but that 's not all			0
now based in @entity5 , a city that he continues to find fascinating , @entity14 is planning more films , although he says subjects are still to be finalised			1
' @entity5 embodies the best and worst of @entity90 , ' he explains			2
' divisions of wealth , vulgarity , energy , breathtaking landscapes , beaches , mountains , deserts , and tracts of crappy housing covering much of the above			0
' talented , funny , creative people creating art that entertains the world and also a certain level of incuriousness about that world			0
' people run the gamut			0
there is a prejudice that @entity275 are shallow and touchy - feely			0
that is definitely one part of the truth			0
' there is a surface friendliness that does n’t always run that deep , but then surface friendliness is better than surface unfriendliness			0

@entity19 , a 22 - year - old from @entity5 , appears in @entity14 ' @entity78
was in a coma and was n't expected to survive his severe brain damage
@entity14 says seeing him overcome the odds was ' amazing '
new film focuses on the end - of - life care on offer in hospitals in @entity5
@entity14 also meets cancer sufferers @entity113 , 31 , and @entity116 , 29
@entity14 ' @entity78 : edge of life is on sunday at 9pm on @entity234
