while cars have come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades , one serious problem remains : most still have a significant blind spot where the pillars of the car are			1
but now a new concept might finally have solved that problem , using cameras to make the pillars ' transparent ' when the driver looks towards them and give them 360 degree vision			1
the car also has a ' smart ' windscreen that displays hazards and projects a ' ghost car ' to help the driver find their way through traffic			1
it uses cameras to make certain parts of the car ' transparent ' ( shown )			1
when a driver looks to the side , for example , the pillar between the driver and passenger door becomes see - through			1
this enables the driver to see obstacles or cars outside the vehicle the technology is employed in a concept car from @entity24 engineers at @entity23			1
it has cameras fitted to the outside frame of the car to provide a live feed onto screens on the pillars inside the car			2
this essentially makes them see - through , with the feed kicking in the moment the driver indicates , moves their head over their shoulder or approaches a junction			0
driving in thick fog can be rather unnerving , with it being difficult to see other cars in the low visibility conditions			0
but a new heads - up - display ( @entity67 ) for cars could alleviate these concerns by showing the position of other cars on the windscreen			2
the fighter - jet - style display can alert drivers to other cars in dense fog and other extreme weather conditions - and this could help avoid a collision			0
the display is being developed at @entity81 ( @entity82 )			0
it is hoped the technology , which is still in concept form , could reduce the potential for accidents			0
dr @entity88 , director of research and technology at @entity24 - based @entity23 , said : ' our ultimate aim is to reduce road accidents and enhance the urban driving experience			1
' the @entity23 research team is developing this technology to improve visibility and to give the driver with the right information at the right time			2
' if we can keep the driver 's eyes on the road ahead and present information in a non-distracting way , we can help drivers make better decisions in the most demanding and congested driving environments			0
' crashing into cyclists and pedestrians could become a thing of the past after engineers with these transparent pillars , designed to give drivers 360 degree vision			0
@entity23 fitted cameras to the outside frame of a concept car to provide a live feed onto screens on the other side			1
this essentially makes them see - through the invention is part of @entity23 's ' 360 @entity124 ' research , which also hopes to improve a driver 's navigation			2
engineers are also developing the ' @entity128 ' , which projects an image of a vehicle in front of the driver 's car for them to follow , turn by turn , to their destination			1
the connected car could also enhance navigation by advising the driver to turn left or right at more visible landmarks , such as pubs or shops , rather than just road signs or street names			0
dr @entity88 added : ' driving on city streets can be a stressful experience , but imagine being able to drive across town without having to look at road signs , or be distracted trying to locate a parking space as you drive by			0
' we want to present all of this information on a @entity67 in the driver 's eye - line , so the driver does n't have to seek it out for themselves and take their eyes off the road ahead			0

@entity24 - based @entity23 have unveiled a smart concept car
it uses cameras to make certain parts of the car ' transparent '
when a driver looks to the side , for example , the pillar between the driver and passenger door becomes see - through
this enables the driver to see obstacles or cars outside the vehicle
pillars either side of the front windscreen also have the same technology
the ' smart ' car also can project a ghost vehicle to follow through traffic
