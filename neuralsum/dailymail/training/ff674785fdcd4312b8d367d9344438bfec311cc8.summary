by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 11:02 est , 9 october 2013 a stolen @entity1 missing for four years has been reunited with her owner after sir @entity5 's campaign stepped in to help			1
@entity7 's dog , @entity8 , was stolen from her @entity10 home in july 2009 , soon after having puppies			1
in august this year , @entity8 was found hundreds of miles away in @entity12 , @entity13 , living with a new family who were unwilling to give her back			1
so @entity7 enlisted the help of sir @entity5 's daughter , @entity16 , to fight her case and the pair have now been reunited			1
@entity5 's vets get scanning campaign helped fight her case flu : sir @entity5 's daughter @entity24 confirmed her father is ' feeling much better ' after a recent bout of ill health			1
he backs the appeal which aims to get all vets to routinely scan for microchips unbeknownst to @entity7 , @entity8 had been adopted by a new owner in @entity12 and in august she went missing from her new home			1
the dog was picked up by a warden who got in touch to say eight - year - old @entity8 had been found and identified as @entity7 's pet by her microchip			1
however @entity7 's joy soon turned to despair when her pup was returned to someone else who proved they owned her with photographs			1
@entity44 had asked @entity13 officers to seize her			2
however , an officer from @entity47 visited @entity8 ’s new home - where she was known as @entity49 - and decided she was well cared for and happy			1
incredibly , @entity8 wandered off for a second time within a month and this time @entity52 ’s warden picked her up			1
once again @entity7 was contacted and for a second time the erstwhile owner tried to claim @entity8 back			1
this time @entity16 , sir @entity5 ’s eldest daughter , quick - stepped in to end the agony			2
her campaign , @entity57 , aims to reunite stolen and lost dogs with their owners			2
in a strongly worded email to the council she pointed out that @entity8 was ‘ stolen goods ’ , backing up her claim with a crime number from @entity44			2
@entity24 also told them that @entity8 had twice been found wandering without a collar , contrary to the law			2
the dog warden quickly decided @entity7 was the dog ’s rightful owner			1
campaign : @entity16 pictured with her father @entity5 , husband @entity73 and her two dogs @entity74 and @entity76			2
she set up the vets get scanning appeal after her @entity79 were stolen from her car in may 2006			0
although she was reunited with them within a week she was horrified to discover that many vets did not scan animals to find out if they already had owners divorced mother - of - four @entity7 said : ‘ i do n’t know what i would have done without @entity24			2
thanks to her , i have my dog back safe and sound			0
’ @entity24 said : ‘ justice at last has been done , albeit in a roundabout way			0
' but we need to make sure that returning a lost dog to its owner via microchip is standard operational procedure for councils , rescues and vets			0
’ @entity24 , 58 , added : ‘ at some stage the new owners would have taken @entity101 to the vet			0
if she had been routinely scanned it would have saved everybody heartbreak			0
' we all think scanning is happening after having our dogs microchipped and it is not			0
’ @entity7 ( left ) was reunited with her dog @entity8 after @entity52 's dog warden found her wandering @entity7 had been bracing herself for court action before @entity24 and the sir @entity5 - backed appeal weighed in			1
@entity24 explained : ‘ why should you have to wait for seven days to get your dog back in case another owner comes forward when your data is in the microchip ? ’ @entity24 , who has confirmed her father is feeling much better , began campaigning seven years ago after @entity79 terriers , @entity76 and @entity74 , were stolen from her car while she was shopping in @entity122 , @entity123			2
although she was reunited with them within a week she was horrified to discover that many vets did not scan animals to find out if they already had owners			0
waiting : @entity8 had been picked up by @entity52 's dog warden once before but given to a different person after they proved ownership with photographs			1
@entity7 had been preparing for court action to get her dog back an estimated 3,000 dogs are stolen each year and many are sold on to new owners			1
by 2016 microchipping will be a legal requirement but @entity139 , a solicitor specialising in dog law , confirmed that at the moment microchipping was not proof of ownership			0
in cases where possession was disputed , a civil case before the small claims court would decide a dog ’s future			0
a judge would consider the merits of the microchip against other evidence , including who has cared for the dog and paid veterinary charges			0
the court would then act in the best interests of the dog			0
the legal terms regarding micro-chipping in three years time had not yet been defined , he added			0
the vets get scanning campaign aims to get all vets to routinely scan dogs for microchips on their first visit			0
this , they hope , will stop stolen dogs sold on to unsuspecting owners being lost forever			0
with her father ’s help , @entity24 runs a busy national ‘ lost and found ’ @entity175 page that backs microchipping and highlights its importance			0
she also speaks publicly about the issue			0
sir @entity5 , who has lent his name to her campaign along with a host of other celebrities , is a lifelong dog fan			1
‘ he is 100 per cent behind this , ’ said @entity24			0
@entity24 said two @entity186 taken from a neighbour ’s home at the same time as @entity8 have still not been found .			1

@entity7 's dog , @entity8 , was stolen from her home in @entity10 in 2009
in august this year , she was found by a dog warden in @entity12 , @entity13
@entity5 's campaign stepped in and helped reunite the pair
