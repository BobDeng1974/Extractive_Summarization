@entity0 believes @entity2 ’s turnaround is evidence of a united dressing - room behind boss @entity5 , as he declared : ‘ we do not want another manager ’			1
the @entity8 travel to @entity9 in the @entity11 fourth round on wednesday with back - to - back victories in the @entity13 having hauled them to the relative comfort of 14th			2
the upturn in fortunes has lifted the spotlight on @entity5 , who had been the odds - on favourite in the top - flight ‘ sack race ’			1
@entity0 has backed his under - fire manager by declaring @entity5 is the man to lead the club @entity5 's @entity2 have won just two of their nine @entity13 games so far this season but the mood in the black - and - white camp is good as they head to the @entity30 , and summer signing @entity0 said : ‘ we want him ( @entity5 ) – we do not want another manager			1
‘ if you lose games then it is normal ( the manager is under pressure ) , but now i expect the pressure to ease on him			2
it ’s nice that we have given him those points			0
’ @entity5 tore in to his players after an insipid first half at @entity46 on sunday and it was a ploy which paid dividends as they emerged after the break to claim a 2 - 1 victory			1
‘ after the first half the manager was angry , ’ revealed @entity0			1
‘ he said to us , “ if you play like that you can not win games ”			2
afterwards , he gave us a compliment and was very passionate , he said “ if you play like that you will win games ”			2
’ @entity58 international @entity0 was part of the @entity2 side which picked up a 2 - 1 win against @entity46 it will be a big ask for @entity2 to make it past @entity9 , especially with the club having gone on the record in stating that cup competitions are not a priority			1
but @entity0 insists the players take little notice of such policies			1
‘ of course , the cup is very important , ’ said the £ 5million former @entity71 full back			0
‘ it is a prize and @entity2 have not won one since 1969			1
it would be a great party if we won a prize			2
the fans want that very much			0
‘ and we need them			0
it is an extra man for us , the 12th man			0
they were fantastic at @entity46			1
‘ that has given us hope ahead of this game			2
@entity9 have a big squad and a great squad – even their second team is very good			0
it will be a tough game			0
but if we play like we did in the second half at @entity46 , then of course we have a chance			1
‘ we ’ve had a great start to the week			0
we want to win the next two now ( @entity9 and @entity93 at home on saturday )			0
‘ we needed those points but we need to be higher in the table			0
two wins in a row after a draw has been very good for us			0
but we still have to improve and now we have confidence to do that			0
’ @entity0 ( right ) celebrates with his @entity2 team - mates after their victory at @entity104			1

@entity0 is keen on easing the pressure off of @entity5
