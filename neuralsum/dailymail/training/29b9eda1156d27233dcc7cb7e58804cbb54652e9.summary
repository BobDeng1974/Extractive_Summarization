inflammatory : @entity1 said climate change denies use ' intimidation ' to get their point across climate change deniers are headless chickens , prince @entity1 has claimed			1
in an inflammatory speech , the heir to the throne spoke out against ‘ the barrage of sheer intimidation ’ from what he described as powerful interest groups			1
addressing young environmental entrepreneurs at @entity16 , he said sceptics were turning accepted scientific wisdom on its head			1
he said : ‘ it is baffling that in our modern world we have such blind trust in science and technology that we all accept what science tells us about everything – until , that is , it comes to climate science			2
all of a sudden , and with a barrage of sheer intimidation , we are told by powerful groups of deniers that the scientists are wrong and we must abandon all our faith in so much overwhelming scientific evidence			1
‘ so , thank goodness for our young entrepreneurs here , who have the far - sightedness and confidence in what they know is happening to ignore the headless chicken brigade and do something practical to help			1
’ @entity1 was announcing the winner of a sustainability prize designed to inspire young people to tackle environmental , social and health issues			1
he told his guests on thursday : ‘ as you may possibly have noticed from time to time , i have tended to make a habit of sticking my head above the parapet and generally getting it shot off for pointing out what has always been blindingly obvious to me			2
warning : prince @entity1 , pictured today visiting a church in @entity57 , made the comments to a group of young entrepreneurs inspection : the @entity1 viewed an eighteenth - century building which has been restored after 12 years of work ‘ perhaps it has been too uncomfortable for those with vested interests to acknowledge , but we have spent the best part of the past century enthusiastically testing the world to utter destruction ; not looking closely enough at the long - term impact our actions will have			1
’ @entity1 has long led the public charge against global warming – despite repeated warnings about his ‘ meddling ’ in contentious global issues			1
his ‘ headless chickens ’ jibe ranks among his strongest comments yet			2
@entity81 , of the climate - sceptic @entity82 , described the attack as aggressive and contentious			0
‘ this is not unusual or surprising as he has made these claims many times over the years			0
but the irony is that in doing so he , @entity1 , is the mirror image of the very climate change deniers he attacks , ’ he said			1
concerned : the @entity1 has shown his enthusiasm for the weather before , and can be seen here taking a turn at the weather forecast in @entity95 committed : prince @entity1 is a passionate about climate change issues - he is pictured here speaking at a @entity98 climate conference in 2009 ‘ it is not about being a climate change denier , as he says			1
it ’s just that people are becoming more sceptical about the extent of climate change			2
‘ he talks about vested interests but he should be very careful his words do n’t backfire on him			0
@entity108 , for example , is making huge profits from the very offshore wind - farms that have angered so many of his future subjects			0
‘ and for many people the issue of rising energy bills now is more important than what may or may not happen 100 years down the line			0
i fear he is ill advised to make such aggressive and contentious speeches			0
‘ one of the reasons the @entity121 and the @entity122 are so loved is that they steer clear of such issues			0
his aggressive words indicate a certain insecurity and intransigence that will not go down well with the public			0
’ last autumn @entity98 scientists said they were ‘ 95 per cent ’ certain that climate change is man - made – but could still not explain why the world has barely got hotter in the last 15 years			2
the @entity132 found that global warming was in ‘ hiatus ’ , rising by just 0.05c per decade since 1998 , down from @entity135			0
but it also concluded that sea levels were rising along with carbon dioxide levels .			0
