@entity34 , the extreme @entity35 formerly known as @entity36 , is seeking to build a so - called caliphate - a new @entity39 state spanning @entity5 and @entity40			1
the brutal terrorist group , which is linked to @entity42 , has carried out a wave of atrocities including beheadings , crucifixions and abducting thousands of women and children			0
the @entity50 ’s latest spy plane - the @entity51 – is already being used to carry out surveillance to help the @entity54 military identify potential is targets and eight @entity57 fighter planes at @entity58 , currently being used for surveillance , could easily switch to a bombing role			2
nearly 200 special forces troops have also deployed to the region			0
but @entity16 , a military grandee , warned ministers to be aware of the ‘ unintended consequences ’ of a military campaign			1
the former head of the @entity67 said : ‘ we need to be very certain of our ultimate aim and we do n’t seem to have great clarity of vision about what we are going to do there			2
‘ there is always a danger of mission creep			1
we need to be very clear on our game plan - what , at the end , is going to make our nation and the globe more secure			0
‘ the problem with getting involved is there is no way you want to become fully involved			1
it would be a dangerous step to have troops on the ground			0

we should use limited military capabilities : reconnaissance capabilities , intelligence , possibly airstrikes and using @entity98 to mark targets for firing from drones			2
‘ the @entity24 is a huge threat to the region and we need to pushing for a very joined - up policy , dealing with our allies , getting people in the @entity105 to get into line			0
