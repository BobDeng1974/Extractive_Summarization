@entity0 was fit and healthy like most 20 - year - old men his age but in 2012 , he got the shock of his life when he was diagnosed with lung cancer			1
within months of diagnosis , he was so weak he was unable to stand up long enough to have a shower because of his chemotherapy treatment			2
but eventually , a drug changed all that and now mr @entity0 is helping the fight to make other ' life - changing ' drugs more readily available to other @entity13 through a @entity15 campaign			1
@entity0 was 20 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer mr @entity0 's experience with cancer started with a cough			1
six months later - when it did not go away - he went to see a doctor and got a chest x-ray			0
mr @entity0 's doctor discovered a tumour growing in his lung and the 20 - year - old said he went into ' absolute shock ' when he heard the news			1
' i was an electrical apprentice , i was a young fit guy and as far as i thought i was perfectly healthy , ' he told @entity30			0
during his chemotherapy , mr @entity0 was so weak he could barely walk ' i worked 45 hours a week and would go to the gym every day and i pretty much felt invincible			1
' mr @entity0 said it took about a week for the reality of his situation to sink in but then he came to a crossroads			2
' i said to myself : " you can sit around and feel sorry for yourself or you can do everything you can to beat it " , ' he told @entity30			0
mr @entity0 - who is now 22 - chose the latter and it was not an easy task			1
he started on chemotherapy two months later but by his third cycle he started to struggle			0
' i struggled with it and i was hospitalised for a week , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' i felt my body had shut down , i had to sit in a chair to have a shower because i could n't stand up long enough to have a shower			0
' the now 22 - year - old ( pictured ) had the opportunity to be treated with a ' life - changing ' drug worth $ 90,000 for free eventually they took him off chemotherapy when his oncologist found out the @entity58 man had a rare anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( @entity60 ) mutation , which meant his cancer could be treated with a different method			1
mr @entity0 's oncologist organised for him to be put on @entity65 , which was a $ 90,000 drug that was not available in @entity13 in 2013			1
luckily for him , mr @entity0 did not have to pay for the drug as his specialist appealed for the treatment on ' compassionate grounds '			1
but before he could start treatment , mr @entity0 had to jump two last hurdles - having a brain tumour removed and heart surgery to drain fluid from around the organ			1
when he eventually started taking @entity65 , the young man said he felt better within a couple of weeks			0
' i put on weight , i started walking again and within a month or two i was going back to gym and jogging			0
before i knew it i was running again , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' i met up with mates in @entity83 for three weeks and really started to get my quality of life back â€“ feeling like a 21 - year - old again			0
' mr @entity0 ( back , second from left ) said he had a better quality of life on the drug and was helping the fight to make it more readily available to others mr @entity0 said the drug gave him a better quality of life and he wanted others to benefit from it			1
so he has teamed up with @entity15 to fight for better access to medicines			0
the @entity99 or treat campaign aims to help @entity13 get the best cancer care available			1
it wants ' empower those patients needing costly medicines with the platform to raise money via online campaigns ' , according tothe campaign 's website			0
' [ @entity65 ] changed my life and people who have been through what i have , i want to help them , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' if it was six months later , i would have had to pay $ 90,000			0
' it gave me a better quality of life and more time to find the treatment i needed			0
' even though mr @entity0 stopped responding to @entity65 after six months , he said it gave him a seven - to - eight - month window to find other treatments			2
now he is part of a clinical trial for another @entity60 inhibitor , @entity127 , which has returned his life ' back to normal '			0
mr @entity0 has returned to full - time study at university , last month he participated in 12km bay run and he goes boxing five times a week			2
and next year he hopes to return to the football field .			0
