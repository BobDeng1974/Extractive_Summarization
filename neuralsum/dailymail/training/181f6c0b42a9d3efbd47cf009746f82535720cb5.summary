by @entity1 reporter published : 04:52 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 06:52 est , 16 august 2012 a baby who was born with a growth on her face the size of a melon has made an incredible recovery after having life - saving surgery to have it removed			1
@entity10 was born with a huge cyst on the side of her face - that was bigger than her own head , and weighed almost half as much as she did			1
surgeons battled to remove the growth in a gruelling nine - hour operation - which saw little @entity10 have 96 pints of blood pumped into her tiny body to keep her alive			1
doctors urged @entity23 to terminate her pregnancy because they thought @entity10 could be disabled , but she refused now aged 20 weeks , she has finally been given the all clear to go back to the family home in @entity27 , @entity28			1
her mother @entity23 , 20 , said : ' i was absolutely terrified when i found out @entity10 had something wrong with her			1
' the doctors were urging me to terminate the pregnancy , as they feared @entity10 would be severely disabled , but i absolutely refused			1
' when she was born i fell in love with her instantly			0
when i looked at her i saw my baby girl alive , not the growth			0
' the operation to remove the it was really risky - i was terrified the cyst would rupture and she would bleed to death - but the surgeons were amazing			1
' she needed 96 pints of blood transfued - the average baby only has one pint in their body			2
i 'm just so glad to have my little girl home with me at last			0
' medics realised there was something wrong with the pregnancy after @entity23 , desperate to know the sex of her baby , booked herself in for an extra ultrasound scan			2
before ; @entity10 's cyst was due to the abnormal development of the lymphatic vessels that drain fluid from tissues after : surgeons managed to remove the cyst following nine hours of surgery sonographers quickly spotted a huge swelling on the baby 's face - and feared she would be born with severe disabilities			1
@entity23 said : ' i booked an extra scan at 17 weeks at @entity71 to find out the sex of the baby because i was so impatient			0
' the sonographer was staring at the screen and instantly i knew something was wrong			0
he said he could see swelling so booked me in for a more detailed examination the next day			0
' doctors were concerned about the baby and urged @entity23 to terminate the pregnancy , but the mother - to - be refused to give up on her unborn baby			1
at 36 weeks pregnant , still unsure of her unborn baby 's exact prognosis , @entity23 had an mri scan which confirmed that @entity10 had combined venous - lymphatic malformation			1
@entity10 will always have some scarring			1
her mother said : ' i 'm so proud of her			2
' the ultra-rare condition results from an abnormal development of the lymphatic vessels that drain fluid from tissues			0
when these vessels develop abnormally they can cause a localised swelling , often with cysts , and sometimes blood vessels can also develop abnormally in the same area			0
a caesarean was planned for 27 march , at @entity102 , as a natural birth would be too dangerous for the pair			0
doctors explained they would need to carry out a risky procedure during the birth where they would insert a ventilator into @entity10 's throat before the umbilical cord was cut , to help her breathe			1
medics were so worried about the procedure , there were 18 doctors and nurses in the room when @entity10 was born			1
she was rushed to intensive care after the baby 's lung collapsed minutes after birth			2
@entity23 said : ' @entity10 was bought to see me before she was rushed to intensive care at just three hours old			2
my legs were n't working because of the spinal block so i could n't lean over to see her , so the doctor guided my hand in to feel her face			0
' when @entity10 was just six days old , surgeons decided to operate on the cyst			1
@entity23 said : ' the surgeon explained that there was a risk that it might rupture and that she would bleed and they would n't be able to control it			0
' they said if that happened then there will be nothing they can do for her			0
i was worried but i knew she was in the safest possible hands			0
@entity10 had several bleeds but luckily with a bit of pressure they managed to stop them			2
' dr @entity143 , paediatric @entity144 surgeon at @entity145 , carried out the surgery and said : ' this was an extremely difficult and rare case and @entity10 's condition was critical			1
the lesion was very delicate and therefore bleeding was challenging			0
' following surgery , @entity10 continued to be cared for by our intensive care team before she became well enough to recover on our neurosurgical ward			1
' although she required further surgery , she has now returned home and we are pleased with her progress			2
' this is a wonderful example of how the doctors and nurses throughout @entity145 work well together to save the life of a newborn			2
' after nine hours @entity10 came out of surgery and started her recovery			1
@entity23 said : ' she looked so battered and bruised , it was heartbreaking seeing her in that state			0
it was so hard not being able to hold her until she was 15 days old			0
' now , at 20 weeks old , @entity10 has been able to go home to her proud mum			2
@entity23 said : ' @entity10 will be scarred for life but it 's a small price to pay			1
when her bandages came off after the surgery i used to still wrap her up in them when we went outside because i was worried what people would think			0
' now i do n't , she 's been through so much and i 'm so proud of her			0

doctors told @entity10 's *parents* she could die if cyst ruptured during nine - hour surgery
@entity10 's mother refused to terminate the pregnancy after doctors feared @entity10 could be severely disabled
