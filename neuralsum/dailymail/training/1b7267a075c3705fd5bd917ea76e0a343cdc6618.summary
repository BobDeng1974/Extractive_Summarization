pitchforks at the ready ! behind the perfectly pruned hedgerows of @entity3 's gardening community people are whispering			1
and the hot topic is what will happen at this week 's @entity6 when the @entity8 's new presenter at @entity3 's most prestigious horticultural event bumps into his predecessor @entity10 , who 's exhibiting there for the first time in three decades			1
@entity10 , who until last year had hosted the event for almost 30 years , announced he was walking out six months ago because the @entity8 was talking to another presenter about hosting its coverage of @entity6 - two daily programmes , one on @entity17 and one on @entity19 , during the five - day show - which he claimed was his ' chosen profession and area of expertise '			1
@entity24 ruffled a few feathers when it was revealed that he would be presenting this year 's @entity6 instead of @entity10 it turns out he was talking about @entity29 's own gardening expert , @entity24			1
while @entity24 's appointment has pleased the millions of fans who adore his many gardening shows and columns in this magazine , there 's a section of the horticultural community who are n't happy			1
they still regard him as an amateur despite his decades in the business			2
@entity10 , who 's an ambassador for the @entity42 and has certificates from the @entity44 and @entity45 , is one of them			1
@entity24 , who has no qualifications in gardening , is one of us			1
fortunately @entity24 , 58 , has had enough brickbats thrown at him in his long career to be able to laugh them off			1
' if people want to be snotty about me , that 's their problem , not mine , ' he shrugs			1
' i 'd love to say to them , " just get a life ! " if they do n't accept me now , after all these years i 've been gardening , well ... ' he tails off			2
' i always say come and look at my garden			2
is it beautiful ? yes			2
does it give pleasure ? yes			2
there are a few people in the horticultural world who have this rigidity ; they say there 's only one way to do something and if you do n't do it that way you 're wrong			1
but for me the end is to have a beautiful garden and it does n't matter how you get there			2
i do n't make shows for professional gardeners ; i make them for amateurs because i am one			2
' @entity24 will be presenting alongside @entity81 @entity24 's been reporting on and writing about @entity6 for nearly 30 years			1
he hosted the show when @entity83 had rights to the coverage for a few years in the late 90s			2
so he was n't overly surprised when the @entity8 approached him about taking over shortly after last year 's extravaganza finished , even if it has put certain noses out of joint			1
' it was the @entity8 's decision to approach me , ' says @entity24			1
he also insists he 's a huge fan of @entity10 's , even though they barely know each other despite their parallel careers			1
( @entity24 also took over @entity94 from @entity10 ten years ago			1
) ' i 've only met him two or three times and he seems a very pleasant chap , ' he says			0
' you 'll never find anyone who 's worked with him to have a bad word to say about him			1
he seems a decent and hard - working man and i admire him			1
i know we 're pitched as rivals but the way i see it there is room for the both of us			0
@entity24 's just happy to be hosting the event , along with a true gardening novice , @entity8 newsreader @entity81			1
' there 's nothing like @entity6 anywhere else in the world , ' he says , adding that the flower show does the two things it needs to do well brilliantly			1
' for the industry , it 's a benchmark , it 's the gold standard that everything else is measured by			1
if you 're a gold medallist at @entity6 you 're the best			1
while for the public it 's part of the @entity3 social calendar like @entity124 and @entity125			1
' the @entity3 are very good at this mixture of ceremony and love of the countryside , and it all comes together at @entity6			1
some @entity132 gardening friends who were here one year were staggered at how much attention is lavished on a show with flowers			1
' in all the time he 's been covering @entity6 , @entity24 has seen big changes ; in particular in the amount sponsors are prepared to pay			1
' it 's not unusual for people to spend hundreds of thousands on show gardens and a few years ago one show garden crossed the Â£ 1 million mark			1
@entity10 walked away from the programme that he had presented for 30 years after hearing rumours that @entity24 was tipped to takeover the worry is that if @entity6 becomes too dominated by big money then you can lose the element of risk			1
people are afraid to try something new			0
' but the people who run @entity6 are aware of that and a few years ago they introduced an area where young designers are given the chance to show off what they can do on smaller patches			1
we all know we need to encourage young people to come into this world			0
' @entity24 's been gardening since he was seven			1
his mother , who had five children and also looked after her own mother who was suffering from @entity166 's , would send her children out into the garden to save her sanity and also to grow fruit and veg that would feed the family			1
his father , a soldier , was often not around			0
' there was a lot of work to do ; wood to chop , coal to get			0
until the late 60s we had no central heating or freezer ; none of the mod cons we take for granted			0
life was busy but it taught us how important it is to work hard			0
' gardening was always a hobby ; in his teens he gardened for neighbours and worked his way through @entity192 , where he read @entity193			0
it never crossed his mind to take it up as a profession			0
@entity24 has no gardening qualifications but he has been reporting on @entity6 for 30 years so has lots of experience ' if you 're someone from my background , which is middle class , it 's assumed you 'll become a teacher or a doctor , or something like that			1
if i 'd said i wanted to be a gardener it would have been seen as a wasted opportunity			0
looking back , that 's appalling			1
' at that point he and his wife @entity213 - who he met at @entity192 - had seen their jewellery company collapse			2
they lost their home and @entity24 had to go on the dole to keep the family - by then they 'd had their three children - afloat			1
' i had to start again from scratch , ' he says			0
he began writing about his first love , gardening , and then presenting			2
the jobs started rolling in and when he took over as the main host on @entity94 in 2003 he was the first amateur to do it			0
he worked as hard as he possibly could , waking up at 3.45am to fit everything in			0
' losing a house gives you a refugee mentality , ' he says			0
' you always think the rug is going to be pulled away from under your feet			0
there 's a fine line between enjoying work and working hard and looking after your family and ensuring your family has everything they need ; and overworking			2
' it 's a lesson he learned the hard way			2
in 2008 he had a minor stroke			0
first he tried to shrug off the symptoms , and even after he was diagnosed he tried to go back to work almost immediately but realised he just could n't do it and had to give up @entity94			0
it 's only in the last few years he 's been able to get back to work properly ; he started back on @entity94 in 2011 , but only on the proviso that he could do it from his own garden , the glorious @entity254 in @entity255			2
but now he seems to be working as hard as ever ; as well as @entity94 , which continues until november , and @entity6 , he 's been presenting a @entity83 show called @entity257 and is also filming a new @entity8 show called @entity259 , @entity260 , creating gardens for people with little space			1
after that he 'll make another @entity8 show , @entity265 , before a new series of his @entity268 show @entity267 , exploring the relationships between humans and wildlife			0
' you always think the rug is going to be pulled away from under your feet			0
there 's a fine line between enjoying and overworking			2
' ' i 'm working harder than ever but now i 've learned to pace myself , ' he says			0
' my stroke was a warning shot and i 'm careful now			0
i do n't do things that are too demanding			0
and i 've learned to relax more ; i 've got better at taking time off and turning the phone off and not looking at the email			0
i do yoga every day which helps with the relaxation and i 've also learned to just not care about certain things			0
i 've realised there are more important things in life than being on tv			0
' the new relaxed @entity24 is a happier one			1
he 's been plagued by depression since his 20s ; describing it as ' great spans of muddy time ' where he 'd struggle to get out of bed			2
gardening was his consolation , but not a cure			0
for that he needed pills , light boxes and therapy			0
he seems to surprise himself when he admits his depression has been almost non-existent in recent years			0
' i think with age you learn to manage your resources , ' he says			0
' i think not getting over-tired is very important			0
if you 're doing work you like that helps			0
and i have a very good support system			0
i 'm lucky i adore my wife			0
every year our relationship seems to get better			2
i also feel happier in myself			0
' a famously organic gardener - who often provokes anger from chemical companies when he suggests alternatives to pesticides in his weekend column - he says he gets a lot of letters from readers terrified of plant diseases , but he advises them to ignore smaller problems and only worry about big ones			2
and that 's how he now lives his life			2
' in gardening , as in life , you should look at the bigger picture			0
it 's all about balance			2
if you get the balance right , things will look after themselves			0
' the @entity6 coverage starts on @entity17 tomorrow at 5.35pm , then runs daily until 25 may , on @entity17 from 3pm and @entity19 from 8pm .			1
