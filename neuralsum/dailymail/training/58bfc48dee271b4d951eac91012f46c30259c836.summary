forced to march in a human chain and lined up with hands behind their heads , this is how to round up illegal immigrants @entity5 - style			1
@entity7 police launched a no - nonsense crackdown on suspected illegals working on stalls in a market			1
officers prodded suspects with batons and pinned them against police vans as searches were carried out			0
no nonsense : immigration officers and police yesterday raided @entity21 market in @entity7 looking for illegal immigrants			1
this man was spread - eagled against a police bus tough : out of 11 million migrants currently living in @entity5 , four million are believed to be illegal immigrants others were forced to keep their arms in the air while police looked for documents – or a lack of them			1
the suspects were then frog - marched on to a police bus with their hands on the shoulders of the person in front , and driven away from the @entity21 market to face a rapid expulsion from the country			1
the approach is in stark contrast to last month ’s softly - softly dawn swoop by @entity44 police on an illegal camp of 63 @entity47 gipsies in central @entity49 ’s exclusive @entity48			0
after being detained , the gipsies were offered free flights home if they agreed to leave @entity44 immediately			0
humiliating : once they have been searched , the suspected illegal immigrants were lined up single file and marched onto the police bus not happy : looking solemn , and under the guard of a fierce looking police officer , the men are marched away questioning : a police officer quizzes this man as he searches his items only 20 accepted			1
the rest were allowed back on the streets after being ordered to leave the country within 30 days			0
just three days later dozens were back at the litter - strewn camp , which has been blamed for a rise in petty crime in the @entity68			0
this week ’s @entity7 operation was one of a string of raids on @entity5 markets which have rounded up more than 1,000 suspected illegals , mostly from @entity75 and former @entity77 states such as @entity78 and @entity79			2
it follows an alleged attack on a policeman by two fruit sellers at one market , according to the @entity85			0
uncompromising : the men were forced to stand still with their hands behind their heads as they waited for instructions from the police smiling : these detainees appear to see the funny side as they are led away by police officers and anger over illegal immigration is such that nationalists armed with baseball bats demanded to see market vendors ’ paperwork in an incident in @entity101			2
@entity102 , of the @entity5 @entity103 , said : ‘ some 11,193,289 immigrants are living in @entity5 , and 3.76million of them live here illegally			2
‘ we are searching for them and expel from the country as we find them .			0
