@entity0 has accused @entity1 of running away from the leaders debates after he refused to take part in any during the election campaign @entity1 tonight flatly refused to appear in televised leaders debates during the election campaign - despite @entity8 's biggest broadcasters threatening to go ahead without him			1
number 10 said the prime minister 's position was ' clear ' – reiterating that he was willing to do one seven - way debate at the end of march but no more			1
@entity15 's response came after the @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 rejected his ' final offer ' – and threatened to ' empty chair ' him if he did not show up			0
they said they would stick to their plan for three debates during april - including a head - to - head showdown between mr @entity1 and @entity0 - and urged mr @entity1 to ' reconsider ' his refusal to take part in these shows			1
@entity15 had written to the broadcasters on wednesday saying the @entity11 's ' final offer ' was a single 90 - minute debate featuring at least seven leaders before march 30			1
but in a joint statement , the broadcasters said they would stick to plans for a seven - way debate involving mr @entity1 , @entity38 's @entity0 , @entity39 of the @entity40 and the leaders of the @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 on @entity17 on april 2			1
this would be followed by a second show on @entity16 featuring the same line - up on april 16 and a final one - on - one clash between the @entity51 and @entity38 leaders on @entity52 and @entity19 on april 30 - exactly a week before the may 7 election			2
in a letter to mr @entity56 , the broadcasters made clear they were ready to go ahead with the debates even if mr @entity1 decides not to take part - effectively ' empty - chairing ' the prime minister			1
they wrote : ' we very much hope that all invited leaders will participate in the broadcast debates			0
' however , in the end all we can do - as impartial public service broadcasters - is to provide a fair forum for debates to take place			1
it will always remain the decision of individual leaders whether or not to take part			0
' mr @entity39 called on the prime minister to join the debates in a message on @entity75 : ' come on , @entity1 , you have n't got your own way so accept it and take part			1
' labour leader @entity0 said the prime minister 's was running scared of taking him on in leaders debates the deputy prime minister @entity39 said the prime minister should accept the broadcasters ' decision @entity84 's first minister @entity83 said the @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 had called mr @entity1 's bluff but @entity86 immediately hit back at the broadcasters tonight			1
@entity56 , @entity15 's director of communications , replied to the broadcasters : ' i made the prime minister 's final position clear in my last letter – he is willing to do a seven - way debate in the week beginning march 23rd			1
' clearly it is disappointing that you are not prepared to take him up on that offer			0
' i am ready to discuss at your convenience the logistics of making the debate we have suggested happen			0
' the @entity104 's director of communications @entity56 has written to the broadcasters tonight the standoff leaves the prospect of election debates hanging by a thread			2
in their statement , the broadcasters said : ' today the @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity18 confirm they will continue with the series of televised leaders ' debates as planned in the general election campaign			1
' the broadcasters welcome the fact that the prime minister has for the first time agreed to take part in a televised debate			2
' however , the group believes there needs to be two seven - way debates of a minimum of two hours each , within the election campaign , allowing time to properly represent the views of all parties , covering a broad range of subjects			1
' the broadcasters also believe that a head - to - head debate between the two individuals who could become prime minister - @entity1 and @entity0 - is important - something the prime minister has publicly supported			1
' they added : ' the broadcasters would like the prime minister to reconsider taking part in all of these debates			2
twenty - two million people watched the leaders ' debates in 2010 and there is a public desire and expectation for them to happen again in 2015 ' the broadcasters ' proposals have come after extensive work over the last six months to ensure the public have the opportunity to watch televised election debates once more			2
' the group have worked in an independent , impartial manner , treating invited parties on an equitable basis			0
they have listened to the views expressed by all parties and adapted the proposals to take into account electoral support			0
' the broadcasters will continue to work closely with all parties invited to take part in the televised debates to bring them to their millions of viewers across the @entity8			2
the heads of news of all four broadcasters would welcome the opportunity to meet mr @entity1 , or his representatives , to discuss the debates			2
' following stormy exchanges on the debates at @entity119 's questions in the @entity179 on wednesday , @entity52 and @entity19 said they were ready to move the two - header debate to another date if mr @entity1 and mr @entity0 could agree on a preferred day			1
the new statement made clear that this offer remains on the table			0
@entity187 leader @entity186 and the @entity44 's @entity83 have attacked the the prime minister 's stance over the debates in the letter to mr @entity56 , the broadcasters said elements of the debate he proposed had not been ' fully thought through '			2
they said his proposal involved ' an idea that you had not raised in the previous six months of discussions ' on the debates			0
the letter said : ' we believe the proposal for just one debate of 90 minutes duration is insufficient to cover the main election issues with seven participants			0
' our two x two - hour debates format will allow all seven leaders sufficient time to discuss properly a good range of the main election issues			2
one 90 - minute debate with seven leaders would inevitably lead to much less ground being covered , with much shorter contributions from all involved			0
' they added : ' we have given your proposal serious consideration but we do n't think it achieves the goal of providing our viewers with election debates that can properly explore a reasonably full range of issues			0
' @entity226 has claimed the prime minister has set out from the start to ruin the leaders debates in a sign that they will keep the door open for mr @entity1 to perform a last - minute u-turn , they said : ' the debates will go ahead and we anticipate millions of viewers will find them valuable as they did in 2010			1
' our invitations will remain open to all the invited leaders right up to broadcast			0
we 'll set no deadlines for final responses			0
we very much hope all the leaders will participate			0
' @entity43 leader @entity226 said he would ' accept the challenge ' of taking part , even though he preferred the broadcasters ' earlier proposal for a four - way debate featuring himself , mr @entity1 , mr @entity0 and mr @entity39			1
he said : ' i 'm pleased that the broadcasters have stood firm at last but it would have been far better had they stuck with their original proposal which included fewer parties			0
but nonetheless we accept the challenge			0

number 10 said @entity11 would do one seven - way debate at the end of march
but @entity1 will not take part in any debates during the election campaign
broadcasters said they planned to go ahead with three debates in april
