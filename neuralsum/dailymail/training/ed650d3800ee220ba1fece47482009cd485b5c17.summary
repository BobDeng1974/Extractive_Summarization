click here to register - for free - and start picking your £ 100m squad now ... as part of the build - up to the start of @entity8 's @entity7 season , we will be taking a look at players new to the @entity11 with the potential to light up @entity14 's top tier over the coming campaign			1
@entity16 in a nutshell while @entity20 starts another season with injury trouble , @entity19 fans need not worry about a repeat of last season 's striker-less shows from last season - and the reason to hold early season hope comes from the signing of @entity29 striker @entity16			1
the hotheaded centre forward makes his return to @entity14 after a brief spell on loan at @entity34 and whether he 's a big success or not at @entity36 he 'll definitely be making the headlines after controversial and mixed spells in @entity39 and @entity29			1
with a goal every 123 minutes that 's not a bad ratio for the @entity11 and he should get better service from the likes of @entity58 at @entity36			2
and his disciplinary issues are n't too bad given his infamous hothead - he picked up just four yellow cards and hopefully he wo n't replicate that one red in @entity14			0
why you should have @entity64 @entity65 knew as soon as the summer transfer window opened that he needed a striker - and his first move was to steal a march on the rest and snap up @entity16			2
one thing about this tricky frontman is he tends to hit the ground running , and with some @entity11 experience already under his belt he should be in amongst the goals early at @entity36			0
back home in @entity29 he has been banging in the goals and he already has one in pre season from the @entity19 ' @entity81 tour			2
his huge desire to get the @entity84 club into @entity85 so he can compete at the levels he once did with @entity87 , where he made seven @entity89 appearances , should drive him on			0
and when @entity16 wants something , he usually gets it - you just have to hope that 's positive ! of course , it could all go the other way : he is known as much for his hothead as his quick feet - but @entity16 should get the goals early in the season and if it subsequently goes wrong you can use up one of your first few transfers to bring in a form forward			1
@entity105 quality : @entity16 has appeared for both @entity87 and @entity106 since leaving @entity14 shores prolific : @entity108 scored 18 times in 28 matches for @entity51 during the last campaign back in @entity14 @entity16 spent a brief period on loan at @entity34 back in 2008 but despite becoming a fans ' favourite with his explosive displays he could n't prevent the @entity117 from being relegated and any chance of a move was shot down			1
he had spearheaded a climb away from the relegation zone similar to @entity122 's that famous saved @entity19 the season before - and like @entity122 , @entity16 attracted attention of top clubs			1
@entity126 were thought to be interested suitors but the striker 's @entity129 club @entity128 wanted £ 20million and the @entity131 were priced out			0
during that spell he showed himself off as a two - footed and pacey forward who left defenders in bits - a promising preview to what he could show in claret and blue			0
@entity11 old boy : @entity140 tries to stop the striker during his @entity34 days the downside @entity16 is a controversial and opinion - splitting character and his performances under @entity65 could go one of two ways depending on what he thinks of his new boss			1
he has been seen as selfish with the ball and often attracts controversy , such as in 2010 when he was pictured making what was alleged to be a @entity153 salute while at @entity106			0
but as earlier stated he tends to get going quickly , so get him in your team before potentially transferring him out if the @entity29 is no longer flavour of the month after the first few weeks of the season			2
back at home : @entity16 controls the ball in a @entity161 match with @entity51 do n't just take our word for it @entity65 has been talking up @entity16 's ability - and the @entity11 veteran tends to know a good striker when he sees one			1
' he knows the @entity11 and now he has become more experienced and more mature , he is going to have evolved in terms of giving us a few more goals in the @entity11 when he gets the opportunity , ' @entity65 said			0
' hopefully he is going to settle in quickly and bring us those sort of options that we need to be more successful in terms of goalscoring next season			0
' he is small and sharp and quick and has got good feet , so hopefully he can give us another dimension			0
' blowing a kiss : @entity19 fans could be seeing @entity16 celebrating a few times this season if he flourishes @entity182 's a cheap for a @entity184 at £ 8.8m @entity16 is cheap for someone proven to score @entity11 goals in @entity8 's @entity7 game			1
he might be a bit of a gamble for both you and @entity19 but if his latest move pays off you 'll be laughing your way to the top of the league - even if that might ask a bit much of the @entity19 .			0

@entity16 agreed a three - year deal at @entity36 after moving from @entity29
fiery forward spent time at @entity34 earlier in his career
he scored 13 goals in 19 games last season for @entity51
@entity108 costs £ 8.8m in @entity8 's @entity7 game , less than the likes of @entity209 and @entity210
