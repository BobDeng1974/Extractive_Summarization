by @entity0 published : 16:58 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 08:34 est , 26 september 2013 with two young children , a beautiful home in leafy @entity4 and a thriving business , @entity1 seemed to have it all			1
like so many of her contemporaries , however , the 30 - year - old also had a cashflow problem			1
with her business , making designer cot bumpers for babies , growing quickly , she needed liquidity to keep up the momentum while retaining the family ’s comfortable lifestyle			1
for most people this would entail going to see the bank manager , cap in hand , to beg for a loan			0
@entity1 , however , opted for a different tack			1
financial sense : @entity1 pawned a @entity24 and a @entity25 that were just sat in her drawer tucked away at her @entity28 home were two expensive watches , a @entity24 and a @entity25 , which she promptly took to the local pawnbrokers and walked out with a £ 3,000 loan			1
' i needed a cash injection to invest in a new product , which i felt would market well , ' she says			2
' it made good business sense , but the bank just saw me as a little cottage industry and was n't interested			2
' frankly , pawning these watches - which i just kept in a bedside drawer - was the only way i could get my hands on a lump sum			1
i would say to anyone who was in the same position and had something lying around that was n’t of huge personal value to do the same			0
' it is a stark change from the traditional image of pawnbrokers ' clients : impoverished strugglers hocking the family silver for cash to buy shoes for the children			1
in this day and age , they are more likely to be struggling to pay the private school fees			1
risk worth taking : @entity62 was happy to pawn her designer handbags and shoes when she needed extra cash for @entity1 is far from alone			1
middle - class families are turning to pawnbrokers like never before			1
why ? well , @entity68 , from @entity69 , says there are certain advantages to using a pawnbroker			2
' it is probably cheaper than something like a payday loan , ' he says			0
' but the big advantage of a pawnbroker is that you do not have to go through normal credit checks , like you would if you were applying for a bank loan or credit card			2
' so it can be viewed as a simpler , no questions asked way of getting money			0
and you get it very quickly as well			0
' ' although i am a stay - at - home mum , with careful budgeting i 'm confident i can raise the money to get them back ' a pawnbroker typically lends up to 50 per cent of the value of an item for six months			1
the customer then repays the loan plus interest , which tends to be between 2 and 7 per cent ( compared with an average 19.5 per cent on a bank overdraft and 17.3 per cent on a credit card )			0
there is , of course , a catch			0
if the customer is unable to pay back the pawnbroker within the time stipulated in the contract , the pawnbroker takes possession and sells the items to recoup the value of the loan and interest			1
for entrepreneurial types in particular , however , it is a risk worth taking			0
in 1971 , fashion designer @entity114 famously raised cash to launch her fledgling wrap - dress business by pawning her diamond ring			2
the dress became her signature and , today , her business is a multi-million - dollar corporation			2
and today , with banks offering very few traditional - style loans , luxury pawnbroking is a growth industry			1
take @entity126 , 45 , who runs @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity4			0
originally a property developer , he found himself living in an upmarket area , surrounded by successful businessmen and professional footballers in million - pound houses			2
growth industry : business is booming as it 's more difficult to get bank loans however , while many of the middle class locals were asset rich , they were often cash poor			1
ideal clients for a pawnbroker , then , and his highly lucrative business was born			2
mr @entity126 's premises are discreet and plain , with a workmanlike counter and sofas that make it resemble a bank more than anything else			2
the secure locked units behind the scenes , however , are packed with expensive jewellery , designer handbags and dresses			0
elsewhere , in underground vaults , he is safeguarding rare books and paintings , while secure garages in a different location store row upon row of prestige cars which have been pawned by their owners for ready cash			2
mr @entity126 , who sold property interests to set up his business in 2009 , during the early months of the recession , says : ' i knew people living in million - pound houses with @entity172 on the drive who were short on funds - people who had built up wealth in cars and fine paintings but could n't use them as collateral at the bank			2
ring recycle the most popular pawn items are gold rings , according to the @entity185 ' association ' they come in here and within ten minutes they can walk out with a large amount of cash or a bank draft			0
' it is not just about high - rolling businessmen hocking @entity194 and @entity195 , however			0
over recent years , women have become just as much a mainstay of his pawn - broking business			0
@entity62 , 41 , from @entity200 in @entity201 , turned to a pawnbroker when she was struggling to pay for the upkeep of her home last year			1
' money has been tight since i got divorced , ' says @entity62 , a mother of two , ' and when my bathroom flooded i did n't have the funds to fix it			1
i was n't covered by my insurance , and while i could have got a loan or used a credit card , i did n’t want to be in debt - which is why i did n’t ask my ex-husband either			0
but he had been very generous while we were married and a friend pointed out that i probably had thousands of pounds - worth of goods tucked away that i could pawn			0
so i rooted through my wardrobe and found a pair of £ 1,000 @entity222 shoes , a £ 2,000 @entity224 handbag and a @entity226 bag that had originally cost £ 17,000			0
middle - class clientele : @entity126 runs a pawnbrokers in @entity4 ' at the pawnbrokers i was offered £ 4,000 for the lot , at a monthly interest of 5 per cent			1
the important thing was that it was enough to fix my bathroom			0
' although i am a stay - at - home mum , with careful budgeting i 'm confident i can raise the money to get them back - and if i do n’t and i lose the bags and shoes , i wo n’t be totally heartbroken			1
' that 's why it 's a win - win situation			1
i got the money i needed and i ’m not left in debt in real terms			0
i felt quite proud that i did n’t have to ask anyone for money			0
' earlier this year , she went back and pawned a @entity24 watch worth £ 4,000 for £ 1,000 , to raise money to take her children on holiday			0
as @entity254 , director of the national pawnbroker chain @entity252 & @entity253 , puts it : ' it 's a middle - class thing , with people needing money for school fees or tax bills			1
' but anyone tempted should heed @entity62 ’s words of warning			1
' only get what you need and make sure that you ’re going to be able to get the money to get that back if it really means something , ' she says			0
' the last thing you want to do is lose it			0
