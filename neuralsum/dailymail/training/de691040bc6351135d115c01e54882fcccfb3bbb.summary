within five minutes of taking a lethal sedative , @entity0 was fast asleep and all of the pain from her struggle with cancer erased from her face			1
she died another thirty minutes later , leaving the world just how she planned - surrounded by her loving husband , family and friends			1
@entity11 , the widower of the 29 - year - old who has become the face of the right - to - die movement , spoke out this week in interviews with @entity16 and @entity17 to describe his late wife 's last moments on november 1 and how he plans to honor her memory			1
while chemotherapy and radiation were an option for @entity32 , they would n't significantly extend her life and she did n't want to spend what time she had left battling a torturous disease in a stuffy hospital			1
instead , she decided to spend her last months on @entity48 rock climbing , traveling and spending time with her beloved husband , who she only married in september 2012			2
she decided beforehand that if she was feeling well on november 1 , that she would delay her death			1
but a seizure in the morning led her to commit herself to follow through with the brave act			0
' it was a reminder of what she was risking because what was coming next was losing her eyesight , becoming paralyzed , inability to speak and she ’d be essentially trapped in her own body , ' @entity11 told @entity17			1
after breakfast , @entity11 says he and @entity32 took a 90 minute hike with friends and family and their dogs @entity66 and @entity67 near the home they rented in @entity70 , @entity71 to apply for the drug			1
@entity71 is one of three states in the @entity75 that has legalized doctor - assisted suicide			1
circled on the calendar : @entity32 ( pictured ) marked november 1 as the day she wanted to die			1
she said she would delay the death if she felt well that day , but a small seizure in the morning commited her to take the lethal dose of secobarbital short romance : @entity32 and @entity11 , 43 , wed in september 2012 , and a little more than a year later she was diagnosed with brain cancer when they got back from the hike , @entity32 said she knew it was ' her time '			1
' she was tired of the pain , the discomfort , the suffering , the seizures , ' @entity11 told people			2
' even that small one that morning was a reminder of how sick she really was			0
' she mixed her prescribed sedative secobarbital which comes in powder form with a glass of water and took it to their bedroom , where she drank the concoction surrounded by her loved ones			2
@entity11 says she put everyone at ease by talking and joking until she fell into a sleep			2
' within five minutes she was asleep			0
and within 30 minutes , her breathing slowed to the point where she passed away			0
she was surrounded by the people she loved and her passing was peaceful , ' he said			2
' it truly was the most peaceful experience that you could ever hope for when you talk about a person 's passing , ' @entity11 added to @entity17			2
' the suffering and the torment and everything she had gone through , that was finally lifted , ' he said			0
he added that his wife had never questioned taking a lethal concoction of drugs to end her life , despite reports at the time suggesting that she may be having second thoughts			1
many of these reports cited videos and photos in which miss @entity0 appeared to be in good spirits			2
' the weeks leading up to @entity0 ’s death , her symptoms were getting bad , ' he told the show , which will air later this week			2
' those videos were taped 2 weeks before , 3 weeks before			0
' @entity0 ’s seizures were getting worse , they were getting more intense , they were becoming more frequent			2
the pain she was feeling , the discomfort , the headaches and when those seizures hit			0
' there was one instance where we had to go to the hospital			0
she could n’t speak for four hours , and the last seizure she had was the most horrific and scary for her			2
' unfortunately , that video , just because of when it came out it gave the impression , " oh , well she looks healthy " , but that was not the case whatsoever			0
her health was deteriorating daily			0
' @entity11 promised to take up his wife 's cause to get doctor - assisted suicide legalized in their home state of @entity155 , which is why he has decided to speak publicly about her final hours			1
living her life : @entity32 decided to spend her last months traveling , rock climbing and hiking - some of her passions			1
pictured above with her husband at the @entity162 but one thing he wo n't reveal is her last words			0
' that 's a sacred part of things for me , and i do n't want to share that with the world , ' he said			0
@entity11 says his wife first read about the right - to - die in @entity71 shortly after she was diagnosed with brain cancer , telling her husband : ' look , if things get bad , this is an option			1
' things did get bad			0
while her initial diagnosis last year gave her three to five years to live , the tumor grew rapidly and just a few months later she was told she likely would n't survive past six months			2
' this cancer was going to kill me and the way it was going to kill me was terrible , ' she told today before her death , explaining her reason to commit suicide rather than battle the disease			0
since doctor - assisted suicide is not legal in @entity155 , the couple moved to @entity70 , @entity71 and last may , she was approved a prescription for secobarbital			1
it was actually her husband @entity11 who picked up the lethal drug at the pharmacy , while she was in @entity195 fulfilling one of her many bucket list adventures			1
fulfiling her dreams : miss @entity0 is pictured with her mother , also at the @entity162 @entity11 struggled with his wife 's decision at first , but was ultimately supportive			1
' did i want her to die ? of course not			0
did i want this whole thing to go away ? of course			0
but did i ever want her to change her mind ? no. i would never want my wife to suffer for no reason , ' he said			0
confessional : @entity11 talks about his wife 's decision in the latest issue of people , appearing on the cover in a picture taken before her death ' she was absolutely resolved to be in control of how she died			1
' speaking of his acceptance of his wife 's decision to die , @entity11 explained : ' you do n’t want to let go of your loved one but to suggest that she should suffer for me , for anyone , no. ' that ’s what you struggle with - here ’s the person i love and i do n’t want to see her go			1
' still on leave from his job as a senior manager in the food industry , @entity11 is now working to help get right - to - die legalized in @entity155 by telling his wife 's story			1
' my preference would be not to be in front of any cameras			0
but this was one thing @entity0 had asked , that we make this a reality in @entity155			1
i want to keep my promise to her			0
' @entity155 legislators plan to propose a right - to - die bill later this month , but it has in the past drawn criticism from religious groups			1
while in @entity253 this week , @entity11 also met with senator @entity254 who hopes to get a measure passed in her own state			2
@entity11 also defended his wife 's honor against those who say she was manipulated by @entity260 the group which worked with her to generate support for the right - to - die cause			1
' if you knew @entity0 , anyone would say that was impossible for her to have been exploited by an organization			2
she pursued , applied for and was given it before she was even contacted by @entity260			0
she decided to participate because she believed in the casue			0
there 's absolutely no chance that she was being exploited or manipulated at all			0
he has since moved out of their rental in @entity71 and taken their dogs back to @entity155			1
while @entity32 's choice of death provided a sense of closure , @entity11 says he 's still rocked by her loss			1
' i have good days and bad days. , ' he said			0
' but the feeling of loss is always there - particularly in the morning when i first wake up			0
and at night , when the house is quiet and i 'm just there with the dogs , i think about her every day			0
he says he keeps her driver 's license in his wallet now , to see her smile and be reminded of their short , but loving , marriage			0
