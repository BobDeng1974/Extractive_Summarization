by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:31 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 19:34 est , 11 december 2013 betting shop managers are being told their wages are to be directly linked to how much cash punters pour in to a new generation of high stakes gaming machines branded a ‘ social cancer ’			1
a leaked memo reveals that staff at one of @entity13 ’s biggest bookmakers have been told ‘ higher weighting ’ is to be attached to profits from fixed - odds betting terminals ( @entity16 )			1
critics of the machines , which allow users to wager up to £ 100 a spin every 20 seconds , say they are highly addictive and make casino - style gambling accessible on the high street			1
@entity25 : the move by @entity27 will fuel growing calls for the government to curb the terminals @entity13 ’s 33,000 @entity31 – branded the ‘ crack cocaine ’ of gambling – have been under mounting scrutiny in recent months			1
they are increasingly key to the bookmaking industry , now raking in more than £ 1billion a year in profit			0
the move by @entity27 will fuel growing calls for the government to curb the terminals			2
campaigners want stakes to be cut to a maximum of £ 2 , a reduction in spin rates and a ban on offers of free stakes intended to draw in new punters			0
@entity27 , named after its co-founder @entity48 , has 1,375 betting shops across the country , in locations ranging from inner cities to leafy suburbs and rural towns			2
an internal company memo , setting out a proposed ‘ restructure announcement ’ , shows sales managers will attract ‘ per hour ’ supplements of 25p , 75p or £ 1.25 depending on how their shop is graded on three performance indicators			2
as well as traditional over-the - counter slips and stakes , it says they will include ‘ @entity66 gross profit ( which will attract a higher weighting ) ’			1
the @entity68 has also seen documents suggesting that some @entity27 stores intend to trade until 9pm on @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , hours after racing has finished – though the firm insisted last night the vast majority would now close at 6.30pm			0
gambling machine : calls are growing to restrict the stakes and prizes available on fixed - odds betting machines @entity83 , from the @entity84 , said : ‘ the proposed restructure is cynically aimed at incentivising shop staff to increase revenue from addictive digital roulette machines in order to increase their hourly wage			1
it entirely contradicts their commitment to social responsibility			0
’ @entity95 mp @entity94 said : ‘ this is an utterly cynical and avaricious measure that is ruining horse racing , destroying bookmaking and creating problem gamblers			0
’ conservative mp @entity101 said : ‘ there has been significant criticism of the pernicious effect these machines are having			2
we need to think about the impact not just on problem gamblers but their families			0
’ a spokesman for @entity27 said : ‘ @entity27 has announced to its staff a proposed restructuring of the company ’s shop estate , which we believe will help drive the business forward and give all our employees a defined career path			0
it is however incorrect to state that the grading of the shops is based purely on gross profit from the fixed odds betting terminals			1
‘ the grading is based on three factors that reflect the business of a high street betting shop : the number of over-the - counter slips taken , over-the - counter stakes , and gross profit from the fixed odds betting terminals			1
to do otherwise would be unfair on our staff			0
