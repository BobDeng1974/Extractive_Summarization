by @entity0 published : 11:04 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 13:02 est , 3 october 2013 between the two of them , they have divided political opinion the world over			0
but scientists say that @entity9 prime ministers @entity7 and the @entity10 also had something else in common - the use of egotistical language during their respective periods in office			1
dubbed hubris syndrome , it has been suggested that a number of prime ministers may have developed the personality disorder - known as @entity17 - while in power			0
@entity9 prime ministers @entity7 and the @entity10 also had something else in common - the use of egotistical language during their respective periods in office - known as hubris syndrome researchers at @entity26 have discovered that this personality change was reflected in both @entity7 's and @entity10 's use of language			1
@entity30 , say the researchers , is commonly associated with a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one 's own competence , accomplishments or capabilities			1
it is characterised by a pattern of exuberant self - confidence , recklessness and contempt for others , and is most particularly recognised in subjects holding positions of significant power			0
fourteen clinical symptoms of hubris syndrome have been described			0
people who show at least three of these could be diagnosed with the disorder			0
researchers at @entity26 , searched for evidence of some of these clinical features in the language used by three @entity9 prime ministers – @entity59 , @entity7 and @entity60 – by examining transcribed samples of spoken language taken from prime minister 's questions			1
@entity65 they thought that frequent use of certain words or phrases , such as ' sure ' , ' certain ' and ' confident ' , the first person pronouns ' i ' or ' me ' , references to @entity72 or history , might show up during ' hubristic ' periods			0
they found that ' i ' and ' me ' and the word ' sure ' were among the strongest positive correlations over time in @entity7 's speech			1
@entity7 's use of the word ' important ' also increased with time			1
words and phrases that became more frequent with time in the speeches of @entity59 and @entity7 also included the phrase ' we shall ' , while phrases that included the word ' duties ' diminished			0
the authors also found that language became more complex and less predictable during hubristic periods			0
for example , @entity59 's language becomes more complex at the end of her term of office , when her decisions and judgements were opening deep divisions within her own party			2
the same happened to @entity7 's speech during the run - up to the invasion of @entity104			1
these linguistic patterns were not reflected in the language of @entity60			0
the relative frequency of the word ' we ' compared to ' i ' was in fact higher throughout the terms of office of both @entity10 and @entity7 than at any point of @entity60 's premiership			1
additionally , the changes over time in words and phrases adopted by both @entity10 and @entity7 appeared to mirror the time course of hubristic behaviour			2
dr @entity121 , the lead researcher , from @entity26 , said : ' hubris syndrome represents a radical change in a person 's outlook , style and attitude after they acquire positions of power or great influence			2
' they become obsessed with their self - image , excessively confident in their own judgement and dismissive of others , often leading to rash , ill thought - out decisions			0
' in other words , the acquisition of power can bring about a change in personality : it is as if power , almost literally " goes to their head "			1
' this work shows us that language can reflect this highly characteristic personality change ' the research is published in the journal @entity154 .			2

hubris is commonly associated with a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one 's own competence , accomplishments or capabilities
@entity9 researchers discovered that this personality change was reflected in both @entity7 's and @entity10 's use of language
