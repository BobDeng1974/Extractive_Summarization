@entity0 has passed a controversial terror law aimed at tackling growing support for @entity4 extremists in the country in a move opponents denounced as a harsh blow for civil rights			1
the @entity9 - passed in the capital @entity11 yesterday - officially enables authorities to detain suspected terrorists for two years without charge or trial			2
but it also allows for the authorities to apply for unlimited extensions after those two years expire - something that will be decided by a government - appointed terrorism board , not a judge and jury			1
the bill effectively reintroduces the controversial prospect of indefinite detention without trial in @entity0 - something prime minister @entity27 originally repealed in 2012			2
rise : @entity0 police said in january they had arrested a total of 120 people with suspected links or sympathies to the @entity4 terror group ( pictured ) , or who had sought to travel to war - torn @entity35 or @entity36 @entity27 's political opponents and human rights groups had urged for the bill to be withdrawn , claiming it is ' open to abuse and is a grievous blow to democracy '			1
@entity43 described it as ' a giant step backwards for human rights '			1
the legislation was passed after midnight , following 15 hours of debate , according to media reports			0
its passage was not in doubt due to the ruling regime 's majority in parliament			0
authorities have expressed increasing alarm in the wake of @entity60 ' bloody jihad in @entity35 , which police say has drawn dozens of recruits from traditionally moderate , @entity63 - majority @entity0			1
yesterday police said 17 people , including two who recently returned from @entity35 , had been arrested on suspicion of plotting terror attacks in @entity11			0

international : @entity0 authorities have expressed increasing alarm in the wake of @entity60 ' bloody jihad in @entity35 , which police say has drawn dozens of recruits from traditionally moderate , @entity63 - majority @entity0 police said in january they had arrested a total of 120 people with suspected @entity4 links or sympathies , or who had sought to travel to @entity35 or @entity36			1
they also said 67 @entity0 were known at the time to have gone abroad to join is jihadists , and that five had died fighting for the movement			0
the terrorism act has heightened worries in @entity0 over a deepening crackdown on civil liberties launched by the government in the wake of a 2013 election setback			2
the ruling @entity88 has been in charge since 1957 , but faces possible defeat at the hands of an opposition that has campaigned against government corruption and alleged abuse of power			2
dozens of government critics , including opposition politicians , academics , activists , and journalists , have been hit with sedition or other charges after criticising the regime			0
leader : the bill effectively reintroduces the controversial prospect of indefinite detention without trial in @entity0 - something prime minister @entity27 ( pictured ) originally repealed in 2012 in particular , the terror legislation has revived concerns of a return to a previous draconian @entity112 that allowed detention without trial and was repeatedly used against opposition politicians			1
the @entity112 was scrapped in 2012 amid public pressure for political reform			0
' the passage of this law is a giant step backwards for human rights in @entity0 that fundamentally calls into question the government 's commitment to basic rights that are critical to the rule of law in a functioning democracy , ' @entity43 's deputy @entity119 director @entity118 said			1
' passage of this legislation raises serious concerns that @entity0 will return to practices of the past when government agents frequently used fear of indefinite detention to intimidate and silence outspoken critics			0
' the government did not immediately respond to a request for comment , but has said previously the law would not be used against anyone over their ' political ' views .			0

law allows police to hold suspects for two years without charge or trial
government - appointed terror board can then decide to grant an extension
opponents and human rights groups said the bill was ' open to abuse ' and represents ' a giant step backwards for human rights '
