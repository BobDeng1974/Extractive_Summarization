@entity0 has said it is time for @entity2 to ' step up ' at the @entity3 after the @entity5 's struggles on tour this year			1
@entity2 is seeded no 8 at @entity7 - his lowest @entity9 seeding for more than six years - after failing to win a title since his @entity12 triumph in july 2013			1
the 27 - year - old has found it difficult to rediscover his best form consistently since undergoing back surgery last september and was hit hard by his split with coach @entity18 in march			2
' it seems like the physical issues are behind him - it ’s impossible to say for sure from the outside but that ’s how it looks			0
' it ’s been a process for him to come back from those issues so that takes its toll on the confidence , and he made a big change - i thought he and @entity18 worked well together			0
' ' to change course when he did is tricky so it remains to be seen what happens there			0
you need to give it more time to judge , but you sort of feel like the @entity3 would be a time he needs to step up because it ’s been a struggle compared to what it ’s been the last couple of years			2
' @entity54 needs to step up - @entity0 return : @entity0 will return to the @entity22 in december for the @entity55 @entity2 , who won his first @entity9 at the @entity56 , will reunite with new coach @entity57 in @entity58 after the @entity59 took a break while her charge competed in last week 's @entity62			1
this is only the second @entity9 that @entity57 has prepared @entity2 for - and @entity0 feels that time will tell whether the partnership will be a success or not			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity57 ’s appointment was a little out of left - field and an unusual choice , but she ’s had some coaching experience and she ’s been out there herself so she can bring things to the table			2
' you always need to give these things some time to see how they relate to each other and whether she can make that little difference			0
' can she help him find that extra two to five percent ? that ’s the key			0
it remains to be seen			0
' teamwork : @entity2 ( left ) has been working with new coach @entity57 since june former mentor : @entity2 ( left ) split with former coach @entity18 in march after a 14 - month partnership @entity86 sent out a timely warning ahead of the @entity3 as the 33 - year - old won his first @entity90 title for two years in @entity62 on sunday			1
but while 17 - time @entity9 champion @entity86 has looked like his old self on court recently , his @entity12 conqueror @entity91 has slumped to last - 16 defeats in both @entity62 and @entity95			1
@entity0 , however , feels that world no 1 @entity91 is still the favourite to lift the @entity3 trophy this summer			1
the @entity99 said : ' @entity86 looks great - he ’s looked the best of all the top guys this summer			2
on form : @entity86 poses with the winner 's trophy after he won the @entity62 on sunday struggle : @entity91 suffered consecutive last - 16 exits in @entity62 and @entity95 ' i think @entity91 had an incredible run at @entity12 and it seems to me he is waiting for the @entity3			1
' i do n’t think it matters a whole lot what ’s happened with his results in the summer			0
to me , he ’s still the favourite going in			0
' there ’s a cast of other characters that will want to break through and finally put their names in the record books , and the most obvious ones are ( @entity123 ) @entity122 and ( @entity125 ) @entity124 , but @entity91 is still the favourite			1
' the @entity21 will be held at the @entity22 on 3 - 7 december			0
tickets are available at @entity128			0

@entity2 is seeded no 8 for the final @entity9 of the year in @entity58
it is the @entity5 's lowest @entity9 seeding for more than six years
@entity0 believes @entity91 is still favourite ahead of @entity86
