in a move to compete with fast - casual restaurants like @entity3 and @entity4 , @entity0 is testing a new tablet ordering system which allows customers to customize their burgers with 20 mix - and - match ingredients like guacamole and tortilla chips			1
@entity12 's started testing the new system last year at two @entity15 stores and recently expanded to two restaurants in @entity17 , but the project could be rolling out to other stores soon as the chain battles its lowest sales slump in more than a decade			1
experts say the @entity24 feature is designed to appeal to younger customers , which have stopped patronizing @entity12 's in favor of fast - casual restaurants like @entity3 where they can chose the ingredients that go into their order			1
@entity30 : the @entity24 feature allows customers to choose from 22 different ingredients to make their sandwich the way they want it			2
above , a picture of the fast - food chain 's signature @entity38 ' the problem for chains like @entity0 is that with this generation , the @entity45 in particular , the standard of expectations has risen , ' @entity39 , owner of @entity40 , told @entity47			1
' the standards that were ok for our parents , are nâ€™t necessarily ok for us			0
' the ordering system still has a few kinks it has to work out , like the fact that customers who want to also order off the main menu must submit their order at the counter , instead of just using the @entity24 tablet			0
at the restaurants currently offering the @entity62 burger option , employees stand at the front of the store explaining the tablet ordering system			0
all burgers are made with patties used for the @entity69 sandwich , and are freshly grilled for every custom order			0
customers then have a choice of buttered and toasted bun ( artisan or brioche ) , cheese ( @entity77 , sharp white cheddar , pepper jack ) , and an assortment of other mix - and match toppings like guacamole , grilled mushrooms , pickled jalapenos and garlic aioili			2
can i have your order please ? above , build your burger ordering systems seen above in one southern @entity93 @entity12 's restaurant touch start : customers start the @entity24 ordering process by using a tablet , as seen above beef : all of the build your burgers are made with the same beef pattie used in the @entity69 sandwich bun : customers have a choice between an artisan bun and a brioche bun			2
both are buttered and toasted to order cheese : instead of plain @entity77 , which @entity12 's uses on its other cheeseburgers , customers can opt out for sharp white cheddar or natural pepper jack extras : other toppings include guacamole , grilled mushroom and tortilla strips spreads : spicy mayo , creamy garlic sauce , ketchup , regular mayo , mustard and special sauce are among the choices of spreads @entity131 : @entity132 is the only addition that costs extra in the @entity24 process the only topping that costs extra is bacon , which adds 80 cents to the order			1
the total cost of these burgers average around $ 5.49			0
when the burger is prepared , employees deliver it to the customer 's table in a metal basket instead of handing it out on a plastic tray at the counter			0
and when the customer is finished eating , an employee comes out again to bus the able and to ask about the experience			0
the new ordering program appears to be an attempt to address dropping sales at the fast - food chain			1
experts say @entity12 's is trying out the program to compete with fast - casual restaurants like @entity3 , which give customers more options on their orders			1
above , a line at @entity3 shows how customers choose their burrito toppings this month , @entity12 's posted its worst same - stores sales decline since 2003 , and sales at stores open at least 13 months dragged 3.7 per cent in august			1
the slow sales may be due in part to the young millennial generation 's preference for fast casual restaurants			2
the percentage of customers aged 19 to 21 has fallen each month by 12.9 per cent since the beginning of 2011 , and has remained flat for the 22 to 27 age group			0
' @entity0 sales are declining , so they 're looking for another way to generate revenues and reach a different crowd , ' @entity177 , president of the @entity178 , told the @entity183 .			0

the fast - food chain started testing the program at two @entity15 , @entity93 restaurants last year and recently expanded to two more
customers order from a tablet and choose from 22 different toppings like guacamole , tortilla chips and garlic aioli
experts say @entity12 's is trying out the program to compete with fast - casual restaurants like @entity3 , which are *popular* with younger *people*
