there were echoes of @entity3 's infamous pole - axing of @entity4 as @entity5 clattered in to @entity6 in sunday night 's @entity8 final			1
true , the giant @entity10 goalkeeper got the ball as he came out to punch clear early in the second half , but as his flying floored the @entity16 strike , thoughts immediately turned to the 1982 @entity8 semi-final			2
then - @entity18 keeper @entity3 was nowhere near the ball when he took @entity4 out , with the referee somehow not awarding a free - kick after the ball had trickled wide			2
the @entity18 goalkeeper had every right to go for the ball with his fist , made a clean connection and his follow - through was natural			2
he inadvertently cleaned out @entity6 but there was no case for a penalty			0
for some observers it may have brought back memories of @entity10 goalkeeper @entity3 ’s awful challenge on @entity4 of @entity44 in a 1982 semi-final ( above )			1
but it was nothing like it for dangerous play			0
however , why @entity28 decided to award @entity18 a free - kick was a mystery			0
a throw - in to @entity16 would have been the right choice			0
harrowing : @entity4 of @entity44 lost two teeth and a suffered a damaged vertebrae after the incident pain : @entity6 could n't believe a free - kick was given against him after the collision there were similarly farcical scenes at the @entity62 as referee @entity28 concluded to award @entity5 the free - kick despite @entity6 's eyes never leaving the ball nor his feet or arms leaving the ground			1
@entity70 , thankfully , escaped unharmed , unlike @entity4 who lost teeth and damaged vertebrae			0
@entity73 : @entity5 highlights focus : both sets of eyes were on the ball ... but it was still a nasty challenge apologies : @entity5 attempts to console @entity16 striker @entity6 during the @entity8 final			1

@entity5 clatters into @entity6 during @entity83 final
the game was tied 0 - 0 between @entity18 and @entity16 in @entity86
it brought back memories of @entity3 's challenge on @entity4 in 1982
@entity44 player was nearly killed in harrowing incident
