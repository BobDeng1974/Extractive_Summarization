a father battling cancer claims cannabis helped cure him of the disease			1
@entity4 , 54 , was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2012			1
doctors told him that without immediate surgery to remove his bladder , prostate and lymph nodes - followed by chemotherapy - he would be dead within two years			1
but worried about his quality of life after such radical surgery , he decided to try alternative therapies - and began taking cannabis oil after learning about it online			1
doctors told him that without immediate surgery and chemotherapy , he would be dead within two years but worried about his quality of life after such radical surgery , he decided to try alternative therapies - and began taking cannabis oil after learning about it online he claims that 10 weeks later , despite doctors ' warnings about delaying treatment , the cancer had not spread to any other organs			1
this meant it could be lasered away in a far less invasive procedure - and he the father - of - three has now been cancer - free for a year			1
mr @entity4 , who works as a manager in the oil and gas industry , said : ' it felt like i was going into the unknown , but the cannabis oil changed things for the better			1
' when doctors told me i had gone into remission , i was lost for words , i almost could n’t believe it			2
' ' i feel indebted to the oil and its medical properties , there are alternatives to chemotherapy but people just need to open their eyes to it			2
' scientific research does suggest that cannabinoids – the active chemicals found in cannabis – possess anti-cancer properties which help stem the growth of malignant tumours			2
and @entity64 is currently funding clinical trials using the drug			0
mr @entity4 's wife @entity19 , 55 , said : ' so many thoughts rushed through my mind all at once when @entity4 was diagnosed			1
all i could envisage was i was going to lose the love of my life			2
' we knew we had to try a different approach to save his life			2
' while a healthy diet and alternative medicines , such as @entity79 tea and vitamin supplements , were successful in improving mr @entity4 ’s overall health , he was still in excruciating pain as the cancer continued to spread			1
mr @entity4 claims that 10 weeks later , despite doctors ' warnings about delaying treatment , the cancer had not spread to any other organs it was then that they resorted to using cannabis oil to treat his cancer - risking prison by possessing large quantities of the drug			1
the couple , from @entity95 , made the controversial decision after discovering a popular pro-cannabis film called ‘ @entity98 ’ , which claimed the class b drug could be used as a cure			0
the couple got in contact with a legal manufacturer of cannabis oil in the @entity104 , who agreed to supply mr @entity4 with the drug			1
the couple arranged to pick up 60 grams of cannabinoid , an edible compound of the plant containing 65 per cent tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity111 ) - the psychoactive compound in marijuana - in the @entity114			2
research published last month by the @entity116 found @entity111 has been shown to help combat the growth of cancerous cells			0
dr @entity119 , @entity64 ’s science communications manager , told @entity120 : ' we know that cannabinoids – the active chemicals found in cannabis – can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours			1
' but at the moment there is n’t good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients			0
' despite this , we are aware that some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts			1
' these stories can help researchers build a picture of whether these treatments are helping or not , although this is weak evidence compared to properly - run clinical trials			0
' @entity64 is supporting clinical trials for treating cancer with cannabis extract and a synthetic cannabinoid in order to gather solid data on how best these drugs can be used to benefit people with cancer			2
' although doctors can prescribe the drug to named cancer patients to treat nausea and vomiting , the possession of cannabinoid is prohibited under @entity114 law and can carry a prison sentence of up to five years			0
mr @entity4 said : ' it was n’t a case of i had no respect for the law , i was fighting to save my life			1
' at that point , i would have risked everything to beat the cancer			0
' these options have always been there , even in the @entity114 , but the medical system has kept it from everyone			0
' i never really gave it a second thought ; i was in a race against time , so i had to roll the dice			0
' his wife , an artist , added : ' i would have done anything to give my husband the treatment he needed			0
' even if i was caught , what would they do ? send me to prison for trying to treat my dying husband ? ' the only thing in my mind was saving my husband from chemo , radiation and radical surgery - not my freedom			1
' the couple , who have been married for 33 years , planned to carry out the treatment , which included feeding mr @entity4 60 grams of cannabis oil , over a period of ten weeks			1
the father - of - three , who had no previous experience of taking the drug , said : ' the effects were quite shocking			2
' his wife said : ' initially , @entity4 reacted very badly to the cannabis oil			1
' neither of us had ever used any recreational drugs , so we were n’t aware of the effects it had			0
' at first , it made him very sleepy and non-responsive - both conversationally and physically			0
' he would sleep for up to 12 hours at night			0
it was one of the hardest things we have ever gone through			0
' mrs @entity215 has since written a book called taking control : my journey of @entity220 by @entity221			0
research led by dr @entity223 , at @entity224 in @entity225 , suggests that cannabinoids possess anti-cancer properties which help to stem the growth of malignant tumours			0
mr @entity4 said : ' i feel indebted to the oil and its medical properties , there are alternatives to chemotherapy but people just need to open their eyes to it ' he said : ' @entity238 , both @entity111 and cannabinoids work by switching on cell killing processes that are found in cancer cells			1
' the idea is that by switching these on , cell death can be engaged leading to reductions in tumours			0
' similarly , actions through these signalling cascades could actually make the cancer cells more sensitive to other forms of therapy - i suppose cannabinoids and @entity111 could act by laying the foundations for other therapies to work more effectively			1
' dr @entity119 , science communications manager at @entity64 , said : ' we know that cannabinoids can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours			0

@entity4 , 54 , was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2012
told he needed immediate op to remove bladder and prostate , then chemo
but worried about his quality of life afterwards , he tried alternative therapies
began taking cannabis oil after reading about it online
claims that after 10 weeks , tests showed his cancer had not spread after all
this meant he was able to undergo much less invasive laser surgery
