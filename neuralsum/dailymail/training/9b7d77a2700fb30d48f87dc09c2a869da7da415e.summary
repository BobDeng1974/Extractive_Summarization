as the world lurches from one crisis to another , one thing is reassuringly certain - president @entity4 will be playing golf and usually with his ' secretary of swing ' , @entity7			1
the two men have played golf together an astonishing 140 times over the past six years , drawing envious gazes from @entity13 politicos , who are desperate for any priceless ' face - time ' with the leader of the free world			1
indeed , so close are they , that the president was comfortable enough to step away from the @entity17 to play cards with @entity7 during the now legendary @entity20 's raid that killed @entity21 in 2011			1
golf partner : @entity7 has played on the links with president @entity4 140 times since he first joined the staff in 2008 for his successful bid for the presidency hiring the @entity29 - loving @entity7 away from @entity30 for his 2008 campaign , @entity4 has become firm friends with the man the secretary of state dubbed ' chief of stuff ' for his tireless carrying of bags during his own failed attempt at the presidency in 2004			1
@entity38 played : the president gives one of his famous fist bumps to @entity7 out on the golf course at the @entity43 on @entity44 in 2009 profiled in a @entity46 portrait over the weekend for which @entity4 allowed himself to be interviewed , @entity7 is portrayed as a man the president can relax with while @entity50 tests the resolve again of the @entity52 again , or @entity53 sets the @entity54 ablaze			1
having grown up in @entity55 , the congenial @entity7 , 42 , has played golf with the president more times than anyone else			1
' every president needs a space where he can be quiet and let loose and feel normal , ' said @entity4 to the @entity46			2
' and when i ’m with @entity7 , we can talk the same way we would if we were just a couple of guys having a beer and whacking a ball around			2
' @entity69 , the president 's former personal aide prior to @entity7 recounted the story of the @entity21 card game during a 2013 talk at the @entity74 in @entity75			1
he told those gathered that on the very day of the raid , while the president 's top generals , spy chiefs and administration members such as @entity84 were in the @entity17 , the president excused himself			1
the president ' was like , ' i 'm not , i 'm not going to be down there , i ca n't watch this entire thing , ' said @entity88			0
feeling the weight of the most significant decision of his presidency weighing him down , the commander in chief left the nerve - center of the operationto go to a private dining room where he , @entity7 and @entity95 , the @entity96 photographer ' must have played 15 hands , 15 games of @entity99			1
' @entity38 played again : @entity7 returns the favor to the president while @entity102 looks on at @entity103 on @entity44 in 2010 potentially wielding great influence because of his closeness to the president , @entity7 is trusted apparently because he ' has no agenda			1
' the @entity46 spoke to @entity7 's ex-girlfriend , @entity108 for their piece , and the president 's former deputy chief of staff was efusive with praise for her former partner			1
' when you just need someone who is going to be nice ot you , that 's @entity117 , ' said @entity108			0
while the president himself has admitted he should n't have played golf immediately after he addressed the beheading of @entity52 journalist @entity122 and spoke with his family last month , he defends the frequency with which he hits the links in the piece			2
which club ? president @entity4 on the @entity129 with @entity96 trip director @entity7 in @entity130 on @entity44 in 2009 ' it is the only time i can get four or five hours outside , and i do n’t have the option to take long walks through a city , ' @entity4 said to the @entity46			1
this goes a long way to explaining why the president rarely conducts business out on the greens , as @entity142 and @entity143 were known to do			0
however , when the president does talk shop out on the course , @entity7 is there			2
when the president played with speaker @entity148 of @entity149 and vice president @entity150 , @entity7 , who plays off a handicap ten lower than the president 's 18 , was in the cart behind			1
asked why he seems to get on so well with @entity7 , the president pointed to the man 's breadth of knowledge			1
' he has lived a quirky , adventurous life , ' said @entity4			0
influential : @entity52 president @entity4 , @entity161 prime minister @entity160 and @entity96 trip director @entity7 eat hot dogs while sitting in the stands at @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity149 in 2012 trusted : @entity52 president @entity4 speaks with his trip director @entity7 before getting into his limousine after arriving in @entity169 , @entity170 , in 2011 ' but that means that he knows a lot about a lot of stuff			1
' while @entity7 himself refused to be interviewed for the @entity46 piece , his friends from @entity55 did			2
' he was always the life of the party , 100 percent , ' said @entity180 , an old school friend			0
' he was n’t a position - taker			0
he would never really take sides			0
he was so easygoing , and the chicks just loved him			0
' yes , the @entity46 interview praises @entity7 's manliness , with his ex , @entity108 claiming she looked forward to speaking to him on the phone because he ' sounds like a man '			2
she also lifted the lid on his softer side , claiming that he paints and also his more robust skills at @entity192			0
he is very close to @entity108 too , playing golf , obviously , with her husband and chief of staff to senate majority leader @entity196 on thursday			0
@entity7 's relationship with @entity30 is described as ' more father - son than brotherly ' and the article reveals that he and the secretary of state dined together recently			1
key aide : @entity7 joined @entity4 's campaign in 2008 ( left in @entity75 electioneering ) and is now one of the president 's right - hand men ( right , pictured in @entity207 in 2009 ) he requested @entity30 's blessing to take on his role with the @entity4 team , after @entity211 recommended him to the then @entity213 senator			1
currently single , @entity7 is known for his love of the cult classic movie @entity215			2
' life moves pretty fast			0
if you do n’t stop and look around once in a while , you might miss it			0
' wrote @entity7 in his senior yearbook in @entity55 the piece comes as the president tried to explain why he played golf on the day he confirmed @entity122 was beheaded by @entity53 in august			1
' part of this job is also the theater of it , ' he told @entity229 ' @entity228			0
' well , it 's not something that always comes naturally to me			0
and i 'm mindful of that			0
' he added : ' i should have anticipated the optics ' of playing golf			0
@entity4 , who was on vacation at the time of @entity122 's murder , was heavily criticized for heading to the golf course at @entity44 where he was vacationing on august 21			2
he said he was ' heartbroken ' over @entity122 's death and that it was hard for him to hold back tears while speaking with his family			0
@entity4 blamed the contrasting images partially on how the press follows him everywhere , even while he is ' supposed to be on vacation '			0
he said there 's always potential for bad news to occur , and sometimes it 'll happen while the president is on holiday .			2

@entity7 , 42 , is the president 's travel director and golf - buddy
has played with the president an *incredible* 140 times over the past 6 years
the president values his judgement and feels he has ' no agenda '
*previously* worked for secretary of state @entity30 in 2004
