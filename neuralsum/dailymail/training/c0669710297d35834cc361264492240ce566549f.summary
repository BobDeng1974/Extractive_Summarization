by @entity0 climbers face an array of risks when scaling @entity4 - from freezing temperatures to altitude sickness - and now a scientist has found one that could leave more lasting effects			1
@entity12 radiation expert @entity11 climbed the @entity14 mountain and , with help from his guide , recorded exposure levels at its summit using a @entity21 counter			1
the 36 - year - old found that the high - altitudes expose climbers to an extra @entity25 ( msv ) of radiation , which is five times more than the average annual exposure in a nuclear power plant			1
@entity12 scientist @entity11 scaled @entity4 , pictured , in may 2013 to record radiation levels at its summit			1
the radiation comes from cosmic rays from space and @entity11 found the mountain exposes climbers to @entity25 ( msv ) of radiation - five times more than annual exposure in a nuclear power plant last month , scientists gained insights into the molecular process of how some people get @entity43 diabetes , which could lead to new ways of preventing people getting the condition			1
the research , led by the @entity48 and @entity49 , took place on @entity4 and assessed the mechanisms at which low oxygen levels in the body - known as hypoxia - are linked with the development of insulin resistance			0
the research found that several markers of insulin resistance were increased following sustained exposure ( six to eight weeks ) to hypoxia at high altitude , and that this change was related to increased blood levels of markers of inflammation and oxidative stress			0
@entity11 , a radiation protection adviser from @entity68 , @entity69 , took on the challenge in may 2013			2
he reached a height of 26,000ft ( 7,925m ) before temporarily losing sight in his right eye due to a lack of oxygen			0
his @entity14 guide , @entity77 , then took the equipment to the summit at 29,000ft ( 8,839m ) to record the readings			2
the radiation levels at the top of the mountain are caused by cosmic rays from space , but despite the risks , @entity11 told the @entity87 that no - one has ever died as a result of the radiation			1
the chances of developing fatal cancer as a result of the exposure are also low , at one in 10,000			0
the chances of developing fatal cancer as a result of exposure on @entity4 are low , at one in 10,000 , but @entity11 said if someone received the same level of dose at ground level at a nuclear plant , stock image of the @entity106 nuclear power station in @entity107 is pictured , it would be classed as a ' significant dose ' however , @entity11 said that if someone received the same level of dose at ground level , and it was not due to cosmic radiation , then under the @entity115 's @entity114 1999 the exposure would be classed as a ' significant dose ' and would be at the annual public dose limit			1
' when chatting about my career in radiation protection i find that climbers , despite participating happily in one of the world ’s potentially hazardous hobbies , share the general public ’s emotional fear of radiation , ' said @entity11			0
‘ they do n't realise that as they ascend into the heavens their exposure to natural background radiation from outer space - cosmic rays - increases			2
’ last month , an avalanche killed 16 local guides , including @entity77 , as they helped a film crew from the @entity138 climb the mountain			0
the avalanche hit the @entity141 on april 18 and was the deadliest day in the mountain 's history			0
it brought the total death toll up to 265 from almost 7,000 summit attempts and climbs have been suspended out of respect for the dead .			0

@entity12 radiation expert @entity11 scaled @entity4 in may 2013
with help from his guide , he recorded radiation levels at its summit
radiation at 29,000ft ( 8,839m ) above sea level comes from cosmic rays
@entity11 found climbers are exposed to @entity25 ( msv ) doses of radiation
this is five times the average annual exposure in a nuclear power plant
