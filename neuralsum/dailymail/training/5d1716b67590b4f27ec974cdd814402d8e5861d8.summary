@entity1 seamer @entity0 believes @entity3 's sacking last year was ' unnecessary ' and the maverick batsman should have been dropped for a lengthy run of poor form rather than for misbehaviour			1
@entity0 also appeared to set himself apart from the @entity1 management by saying the situation could have been handled differently			0
@entity3 's international career was brought to a juddering halt by the @entity12 last february in the fallout of the @entity14 whitewash defeat			1
@entity3 's international career was brought to a halt by the @entity12 last year but @entity0 thinks @entity3 's indifferent form when he averaged under 35 in his final 12 tests meant he could have just been dropped			1
' it just became a bit of a media uproar			0
the whole sacking , it just seemed a bit unnecessary when every other player in the history of the game just gets dropped for poor form , ' @entity0 said in an interview on @entity31			1
' his form was pretty poor over 18 months , every other player just gets dropped			2
obviously @entity3 's very disappointed			2
it could 've been handled very differently , i think , by everyone			0
' @entity3 's name continues to linger around the @entity1 team — despite him criticising team - mates , including @entity0 , and the @entity12 in his controversial autobiography — and the 34 - year - old himself remains determined to resume his international career			1
@entity0 ( left ) speaks to former @entity1 teammate @entity3 prior to his axe from the international set - up yet @entity0 thinks that is unlikely due to @entity3 focusing solely on the @entity46 format in the last 12 months , as well as the emergence of players such as @entity49 and @entity50			1
' he 's not played any red - ball cricket for a year so i do n't think a return in @entity54 matches is very likely and he 's not set the world alight in white - ball format either , ' @entity0 added			2
' @entity57 matches we won in the summer against @entity59 were probably the strongest performances i 've played in the @entity61 i 've played , and they were without @entity3 @entity3 is currently playing for the @entity62 ' the guys who have come in — @entity49 , @entity50 — have been the shining lights of the @entity1 team			0
' when you lose a great player , younger guys come in and perform , so actually if @entity3 was still in the side would @entity49 have taken the responsibility on this summer and averaged 99 ? probably not , but he became the shining light of the @entity1 batting line - up			0
' @entity0 was left red - faced on saturday night after appearing to lose a bet to @entity1 team - mate @entity74 and was forced to go to the cinema dressed in his full training kit .			0
