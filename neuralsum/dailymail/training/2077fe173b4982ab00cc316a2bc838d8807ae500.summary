@entity0 will go to @entity1 today to start the countdown to a referendum on @entity5 independence			1
but he faces criticism back in @entity7 that he has given too much ground to the @entity9 by agreeing to most of their demands on how the historic vote should be handled			0
@entity13 , a former @entity5 secretary , compared mr @entity0 to @entity14 for handing over key decisions on the ballot to @entity17 first minister @entity18 , rather like the @entity20 story of the @entity22 prefect of @entity23 acceding to the wish of @entity26 leaders that @entity27 should be put to death			1
the pair will meet today to sign an agreement on the holding of a referendum			0
the deal , reached following months of negotiations about the ballot , will grant the @entity49 the power to stage the historic vote			0
the prime minister will say : ' @entity5 's two governments have come together to deliver a referendum which will be legal , fair and decisive			1
this marks the beginning of an important chapter in @entity5 's story and allows the real debate to begin			1
' it paves the way so that the biggest question of all can be settled : a separate @entity5 or a @entity63 ? i will be making a very positive argument for our @entity63			2
' it is now up to the people of @entity5 to make that historic decision			2
the very future of @entity5 depends on their verdict			2
this agreement delivers the people 's referendum			0
' shaking hands : prime minister @entity0 ( right ) and @entity5 first minister @entity18 seen in july but @entity13 said mr @entity0 had given too much away as a result of appalling negotiating skills			1
he told the @entity81 : ' @entity18 has been able to get what he wants			2
if that 's called a negotiation , that 's stretching the language			0
it sounds like a walkover to me			0
' ' what is going on here is the prime minister is @entity14			2
he is just saying , over to you , @entity18			2
once that order is passed it 's a matter for @entity18 so he is going to dictate the terms ' @entity13 , former @entity5 secretary @entity13 said the expected wording of the question - do you agree that @entity5 should be an independent country ? - was loaded and could swing the vote towards the @entity17			1
' what is going on here is the prime minister is @entity14			2
he is just saying , over to you , @entity18			0
once that order is passed it 's a matter for @entity18 so he is going to dictate the terms			1
' former chancellor @entity108 , who is leading the cross-party better together campaign , also criticised aspects of the deal			0
' i would have preferred to have had this referendum in the autumn of 2013 because frankly a two - year election campaign is going to try the patience of the public , never mind the politicians and those who write about it , ' he said			0
unhappy : @entity13 said mr @entity0 had given too much away as a result of appalling negotiating skills ' in relation to 16 and 17 - year - olds i personally do n't think you should change the franchise for one particular referendum or election			1
' ' i would have preferred to have had this referendum in the autumn of 2013 because frankly a two - year election campaign is going to try the patience of the public , never mind the politicians and those who write about it ' @entity108 , former chancellor mr @entity18 's deputy @entity135 claimed victory , saying : ' if you consider issues over the timing , the question , the franchise , all issues which at the start of the year @entity0 was making noises about ; all of these things will now be determined by the @entity49			1
i think that is a very good outcome			0
' @entity5 secretary @entity149 said : ' i think it 's a good agreement			1
i believe it will now allow us to put up in lights the big issues about the big debate on what is best for @entity5			1
' i believe that when we look at the economy , at defence , at our place in the world , on all these big issues people across @entity5 will continue to support @entity5 being in the @entity63			0
' the most recent poll on independence suggests support for leaving the @entity63 has dropped			0
a survey of 995 adults , published last week , showed support for the @entity169 at 53 per cent compared with support for independence at 28 per cent			0
