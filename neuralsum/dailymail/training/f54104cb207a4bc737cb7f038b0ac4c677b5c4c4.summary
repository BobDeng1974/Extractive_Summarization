choosing a stunning red carpet gown for a high profile awards ceremony can be a daunting task so how do you do it when you have to factor a baby bump into the equation ? it 's a style dilemma that a number of women attending last night 's @entity9 awards and after - parties had to consider			1
@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 were among the stars on the red carpet at various stages of pregnancy			1
the actress is pictured here with husband @entity37 , keyboardist for the @entity38 @entity11 , 29 , who is expecting her first child with husband @entity37 , chose a butterfly print @entity20 gown			1
the actress , who was nominated for an award for her role in @entity45 , often wears dresses cinched in at the waist to show off the slim frame			2
but with a blossoming baby bump to accommodate , this time she opted for a high waist			1
speaking to @entity52 's @entity51 on the red carpet she said of her pregnancy style : ' the waistline goes up somewhat			0
there is no waist any more , so it 's risen			0
' she added that she only had room to carry the essentials in her small black clutch , so make - up was out in favour of nuts			1
she said : ' i do n't have lipstick			0
i only have nuts in here			0
it 's the wonderful thing about being pregnant			0
you just need to make sure you have snacks			0
so this is a snack bag			0
' baby on board : @entity73 and fiancée @entity74 are expecting their first child a hint of a bump can be seen under @entity74 's floral @entity80 dress as she supports her nominated partner at the awards but with a big glass of water it 's clear she had to say ' no ' to the flowing @entity86 style and colour consultant for women , @entity33 , author of how not to wear @entity87 , told @entity91 she was not entirely won over by @entity11 's choice of maternity wear			1
she said : ' it looks like a nightdress			0
frills and ruffles swamp her tiny frame , however empire line is very flattering in pregnancy			0
i love the butterfly accessory , overall it 's a very girlie , young look			0
' another mother - to - be at the awards was @entity73 's fiancée @entity74			0
the couple revealed last week they they are expecting their first baby			1
@entity74 wore a floor - length floral gown from @entity80 's pre-fall 2015 collection as she supported her nominated fiancé , who missed out on winning the best actor trophy to fellow @entity114 @entity113			1
@entity73 , @entity74 and @entity116 designer @entity115 ( centre ) chat to friends @entity11 and @entity37 @entity119 , fashion and beauty editor at @entity122 magazine and content editor for @entity124 online said @entity74 was a clear winner in the style stakes			1
she said : ' theatre director @entity74 looked timelessly elegant in a winter floral jacquard maxi dress by @entity80			1
' a plunging v - neck is a good choice to highlight your décolletage , and a sleeveless dress will accentuate toned arms			1
' the wide waistband is comfortable for a growing bump and the pleating detail from the waist down is super flattering to skim over and out			0
' the colours of the dress have been reflected in the pink tones of @entity74 's make - up and the blue of her eyes			1
' this is our favourite look			0
' @entity11 and @entity74 could have asked fellow awards attendee @entity145 for tips on how to get back into shape after having a baby			1
the @entity150 actress , who was nominated for best actress for her role in @entity153 , appeared on the red carpet just five weeks after giving birth			0
@entity145 star @entity145 wore this daring gown just five weeks after giving birth to her second son not everyone was fan of the @entity145 's @entity162 - style @entity161 gown that left a lot of skin exposed and while some new mothers may feel self - conscious about their post-baby body , the 35 - year - old appeared to have no such reservations			1
she flashed the flesh in a white low - cut @entity161 gown that was cut away at the sides and exposed her back			2
the ' brave ' choice of dress drew both admiration and criticism from viewers			2
while many praised her slim figure , news website @entity178 said her ' outfit choice left a lot to be desired from a fashion perspective '			1
the website 's lifestyle editor @entity185 continued : ' the white @entity161 gown was a beautiful @entity162 style but noticably ill - fitting			2
' the slightly baggy top and droopy neckline were not the most flattering , nor was the overly loose bodice			0
as many fashion writers noted , when it comes to red carpet style , fit is key			2
' but @entity145 revealed her dress got the seal of approval from most important man in her life - her new son			2
she told @entity200 tv presenter @entity199 who was interviewing the stars on the red carpet for @entity204 : ' he was looking at me getting ready			0
he did n't cry ; he seemed to approve			0
' more baby bumps were on show at the @entity9 after parties			2
@entity12 posed hand on bump at the @entity211 and @entity212 mother - to - be @entity12 wore a flattering black floor - length dress , flashing some flesh with her plunging neckline presenter @entity12 , 41 - a former flame of @entity217 - is in her final trimester and will soon give birth to her first baby with boyfriend @entity221			1
as she attended the @entity211 and @entity212 , she wore a flattering black floor - length gown that wrapped around the top of her bump			1
she kept the outfit daringly stylish with a plunging neckline with two strips of fabric covering her chest			0
@entity122 's @entity119 said of the look : ' no stranger to a revealing outfit , @entity12 wore a similar ( non-maternity ) number to the awards last year			1
' while some may say that it is a touch too much , she does at least prove that it is possible to keep your own sense of personal style while pregnant			0
' model @entity13 showcased her baby bump in her flowing acid yellow dress with embroidered detailing meanwhile model turned actress @entity13 summed up the term pregnancy glow by wearing an eye - catching bright yellow gown to the @entity248			1
the 41 - year - old , who is expecting a sibling for her two - year - old son @entity251 in march , posed with her hand resting on her blossoming baby bump			2
@entity33 said @entity13 's look was her winner when it came to the best dressed baby bump			1
she said : ' it 's a great colour that stands out in the crowd			2
it 's well cut and pretty and she shines in it , showing off her pregnancy without flaunting herself			0
she said : ' we are big advocates of wearing colour while pregnant or as a new mum			2
' wearing a bright colour can really enhance your mood and lift your confidence			1
the vertical detail on @entity13 's dress lengthens her proportions and the loose fit skims over her bump			1
' she added : ' no matter what your body shape or size , it is the fit and proportions of the clothes that will make all the difference			0
' make trends work for you rather than being a slave to fashion , and find out what flatters you and your body type , so make the best of your assets and skim over the rest			2
' if you have slim legs , show them off			0
if you have toned arms , like @entity145 or @entity74 , go sleeveless			0
classic styles , like @entity11 's empire line are classics for a reason			1
' just make sure to choose colours that suit your skin tones , and do n't shy away from brights : the key is to have confidence in what you are wearing			0

@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 all had a baby on board
@entity11 wore frilly @entity20 gown that a fashion expert described as a nightie
@entity12 chose revealing black dress and @entity13 was praised for bright colour
