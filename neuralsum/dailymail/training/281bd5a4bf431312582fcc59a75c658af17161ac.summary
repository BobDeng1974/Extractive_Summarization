by @entity1 reporter scientists have developed a new battery - powered defibrillator that can be implanted under the skin to shock failing hearts back to life			1
@entity7 , or the subcutaneous internal cardioverter - defibrillator , is implanted in the chest and analyses the heart 's rhythm via a sensor without having to pierce any area of the organ at all			1
the device can then deliver 80 joules to the chest wall , ' much like you see on a television shows where a doctor will say , " stat , " and shock a patient with paddles , ' said dr. @entity23 , director of cardiac electrophysiology at the @entity25			1
@entity26 : @entity7 , or the subcutaneous internal cardioverter - defibrillator , is a new battery - powered defibrillator that can be implanted under the skin and shocks failing hearts back to life ' having a defibrillator that 's there as an insurance plan , so to speak , is important because it helps to protect them whenever it may occur but at the same time allows them to live a normal life and not have to think about the defibrillator , ' @entity23 said			1
' it 's there doing its job silently all the time			0
' one of the first patients to test the new technology was @entity45 , who has a weak heart muscle and heart valve problems			1
but the 62 - year - old @entity49 resident has no regrets since becoming the first patient here to undergo the procedure late last month			2
high - tech : the device is implanted in the chest and analyses the heart 's rhythm via a sensor without having to pierce any area of the organ at all doctor and patient : @entity64 medicine @entity49 cardiologist dr. @entity23 ( right ) meets with patient @entity65 ' i feel good , ' said @entity45 , acknowledging that while his heart is still weak , ' i have peace of mind , which makes it feel that much better			1
' ' i know that if i go into cardiac arrest , this apparatus will take care of my needs , ' he told the @entity74			0
@entity45 is one of hundreds of thousands of patients in the @entity76 that have cardiomyopathy , or a weak heart , which puts them at a higher risk of dangerous abnormal heart rhythms , said dr. @entity23			2
tense moment : the tensest moment of the procedure came after the device was inserted in the chest			1
@entity23 and his team tested it by inducing a cardiac arrest and then watching as the device sent a shock trembling through @entity65 's still unconscious body , jolting his heart back into life @entity97 can be caused by coronary artery disease , a prior heart attack , a viral infection or an adverse reaction to certain medications , @entity23 said			1
hundreds of thousands more people in the @entity76 may be at risk of life - threatening ventricular arrhythmias , he said			2
@entity97 is a disease of the heart muscle			0
it can be caused by coronary artery disease , a prior heart attack , a viral infection or an adverse reaction to certain medications it can also run in families and can affect one or many members of a family			1
there are three different types of cardiomyopathy and each affects the size and shape of the heart			0
they are : @entity97 can also affect the heart 's electrical system			0
there is a small risk of sudden death in people with cardiomyopathy			0
source : @entity131 @entity23 implanted the new device , created by @entity133 , in @entity45 last month at the @entity134			1
the company selected the initial physicians for the procedure based on their experience and ability to offer this type of care to patients , he said			0
it is not the first implantable defibrillator on the market , but doctors say is a huge step forward in the field because traditional ones required puncturing a blood vessel and screwing an electrode or lead into the heart to conduct the charge			1
the new device , however , was designed to avoid some of the resulting risks , which include puncturing the lung or the heart or introducing bacteria that could cling to the defibrillator and cause a serious infection			2
@entity45 was a good candidate for the new device because a previous surgery had caused a bacterial infection that entered his bloodstream , @entity23 said			0
at @entity165 on monday , @entity23 implanted another such device in @entity65 , 50 , of @entity49			2
@entity65 said he had triple bypass surgery last year and felt lucky to benefit from the new technology			0
' let 's get going , ' he said , eager to get the hour - long procedure underway			0
' once @entity65 was sedated , @entity23 cut a pocket a few inches below his left armpit to insert the generator , which is about the size of a deck of cards			0
using two small incisions , @entity23 ran the lead — a thin , insulated wire — across from the pocket to the center of the chest and then up the chest			0
the battery lasts about five years before the generator needs to be replaced in an outpatient procedure			0
the battery runs down faster than the traditional defibrillator because it requires a greater charge — it 's not as close to the heart			2
the tensest moment of the procedure came after the device was inserted in the chest			2
@entity23 and his team tested it by inducing a cardiac arrest and then watching as the device sent a shock trembling through @entity65 's still unconscious body , jolting his heart back into a normal heart rhythm — ready to save his life should he need it again .			1

@entity7 can be implanted into the chest and attached to heart via electrode
it senses *irregular* rhythm and releases 80 - joule charge shocking heart to life
created by @entity133 , it does *n't* carry the risks of similar technology
tense moment as doctors induce heart attack in first patient to test device
