by @entity0 published : 18:19 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 03:52 est , 12 november 2013 the shocking figures add to growing fears of a casualty crisis in hospitals , which the @entity5 say could be the worst ever at least 12,000 patients spent 12 or more hours on trolleys in casualty units last year			1
another 250 waited for a minimum of 24 hours and one was left for an astonishing 71 hours and 34 minutes – all but three days			1
that case – at @entity15 trust , which runs @entity17 and @entity18 units – emerged in a @entity20 investigation using freedom of information laws			1
hospitals were asked how many patients were in casualty for more than 12 hours , for more than 24 hours and what their longest wait time was in 2012/13			1
one waited for 37 hours at @entity28 and @entity29 while another waited for 33 hours at @entity31 and @entity32 ’s in @entity33 , @entity34			1
campaigners said the figures showed the situation in accident and emergency departments was getting ‘ worse and worse ’			1
‘ patients who are forced to spend that length of time on trolleys will be in a far worse state than when they arrived , ’ said @entity40 of @entity41			2
‘ people feel they have nowhere else to go			0
they ca n’t get an appointment with their gp and their out - of - hours service – @entity51 111 – tells them to go to @entity18			1
’ casualty units are dealing with growing numbers of patients and a desperate shortage of doctors			1
dr @entity57 , president of the @entity5 , said this winter would ‘ probably be worse than last winter , which was the worst we have ever had ’			1
he added : ‘ it ’s not chaos in emergency departments , but it is a crisis			2
’ the prime minister has intervened to help draw up contingency plans that would see beds freed up in private hospitals should a&e units become too full			2
@entity69 has also demanded weekly updates on the situation			2
and tomorrow , the @entity51 ’s top doctor , professor sir @entity72 , will set out a major report setting out what needs to be done to avert a major crisis in @entity18			1
@entity76 , pictured with son @entity77 , was left lying on a hospital trolley in the accident and emergency department at @entity81 for 28 hours @entity76 was abandoned on a hospital trolley for 28 hours			1
the 95 - year - old had been taken to @entity18 in an ambulance after falling in the shower and hurting her leg			1
she was wheeled into a sideroom at @entity34 hospital in @entity89 and left frightened and exhausted – and given nothing but a sandwich			2
it later transpired that staff had forgotten about her and recorded that she had been discharged to a care home			0
she was found the following afternoon after her son @entity77 , 68 , phoned the chief executive and threatened to report her to the police as missing			0
he said : ‘ i was furious			0
this is what happens when you put too much pressure on a system that does n’t work			0
‘ i asked which home she was in , but they would n’t tell me because of data protection			0
i rang the ward , but they said they had never heard of her			0
‘ the next morning , i was told she was on another ward , so i checked with that ward , and again they said that they had never heard of her			0
‘ when i finally saw her , she looked dehydrated , confused and distressed			0
she had received no proper care			0
’ the hospital insisted mrs @entity76 was properly cared for in 2011 but launched an inquiry into the communication breakdown			0
@entity122 , of the @entity123 , said many of those forced to wait on trolleys would be ‘ in distress ’ and have nowhere else to go			0
‘ the types of people on the trolleys for days are the elderly , ’ he added			0
‘ these are the people who go to the back of the queue			0
while they are in distress and discomfort , they are not critically ill. ‘ it ’s really distressing to think of patients in their twilight years being treated this way			2
’ dr @entity122 said many of the longest waits were not recorded by staff and would not show up in the figures			1
@entity122 , of the @entity123 , said many of those forced to wait on trolleys would be ' in distress ' and have nowhere else to go ( picture posed by model ) one patient waited for 37 hours at @entity28 and @entity29 , above , the statistics showed if patients are left in corridors or x-ray rooms just outside @entity18 , staff can tick a box to state they have left the department			1
the number of patients arriving in @entity18 has soared by a third over the past decade and 22million were logged last year			1
rising numbers of old people and the decline in out - of - hours care by @entity163 have been blamed			0
yesterday @entity164 , a hospital watchdog , warned the closure of 50 walk - in centres had piled further pressure on casualty units			1
staff shortages are also a factor because doctors are increasingly reluctant to work the long and antisocial hours			0
half of senior casualty posts have been left unfilled over the past three years			2
action plan : prime minister @entity69 , pictured during a visit to the @entity177 in august , has asked for a contingency plan to be drawn up to combat a potential casualty crisis @entity180 , @entity181 ’s health spokesman , said : ‘ @entity69 has presided over the worst year in @entity18 for a decade , but until now the true human cost has been hidden			1
‘ these devastating findings reveal the suffering behind the statistics			2
’ the @entity186 in @entity187 admitted that 12 patients a day have to wait on trolleys in corridors in @entity18 and at @entity192 hospital it happened ten times a day			1
@entity192 admitted patients were ‘ occasionally ’ left on trolleys in the relatives room			2
criticism : shadow health secretary @entity180 , above , said @entity69 has presided over ' the worst year for @entity18 in a decade ' at @entity199 hospital patients have been put in operating theatres when @entity18 is full and at @entity201 they have been put in x-ray rooms			1
a spokesman for @entity15 hospitals said the 71 - hour case was due to ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ and insisted the patient was ‘ cared for safely by staff who are skilled in dealing with emergencies ’			0
a @entity211 spokesman said : ‘ people should not be stuck in @entity18 for hours on end and these hospitals will need to explain what has happened in these cases			1
’ one in 20 nursing posts is vacant – 20,000 full - time hospital jobs			0
figures obtained by the @entity123 also show 6 per cent of nursing or midwifery posts are unfilled at hospitals			2
the college says too few nurses are replacing those who have retired because ministers have cut the number of training posts			0
cash - strapped trusts have also been using recruitment freezes			0
‘ understaffing remains a real issue across the @entity51 , and we know that many trusts are down to the bone in terms of the number of frontline nursing staff they have due to cutting posts to save money , ’ said @entity122 , chief executive and general secretary of the college .			0
