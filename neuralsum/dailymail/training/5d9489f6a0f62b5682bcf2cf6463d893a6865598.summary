it is a ticking timebomb hidden on the chaotic streets of @entity2			1
despite @entity5 ’s booming economy , millions of people are still battling for access to clean water			1
the situation is so desperate that many people in this teeming neighbourhood are falling sick			1
others have set up illegal taps in a bid to cash in			0
@entity15 correspondent @entity14 reports from the frontline of the war for water			2
@entity2 , @entity5 ’s capital and the political heart of this diverse and vibrant country , is a vast and energetic city			1
one of the so - called ‘ @entity25 ’ nations , alongside @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , the country ’s growing importance and remarkable growth is delivering new wealth to many of its citizens			1
around @entity2 you can see how the expanding middle classes are changing the face of @entity5 , with fresh prosperity expanding their ranks at a dramatic rate			1
but the city also faces a serious problem			2
water , the absolute necessity for life , is becoming harder to come by			1
and it is not just in @entity5 ’s great cities where a growing crisis is taking shape			1
@entity47 , a mother of six , scrubs her thin steel dishes as hard as she can with as little water as possible			0
there is only one way for her to get water : she must walk to the neighbourhood spigot with heavy buckets , before filling them up and lugging them home			2
every one of these children , pictured on the outskirts of @entity2 , @entity5 , has suffered from waterborne illnesses but even when she gets the water back to her family , she worries whether it is actually safe to drink			1
' we get sick two to three times per month , ' @entity47 says			0
' i can not afford bottled water			0
' her seven - year - old daughter , @entity68 , smiles and waves at us			0
she wants to play , but is n't feeling very well			0
' my stomach aches and gurgles , ' she says , before talking about the many times she has been to the hospital			0
there she is often given an injection , which she makes clear she is not fond of at all			0
there are around 100,000 people living in this neighbourhood on @entity2 's outskirts			1
not one of them has ever had water piped into their homes			0
instead , the government turns on just a single tap for them , just three times a day			1
this is how the vast majority in this part of the city gets access to water			2
at the pipe , people line up to fill their bottles and buckets			0
children also take showers under the flowing water			2
the tap itself juts out just a few inches from a drain , which is littered with rubbish and sewage , as well as clumps of bright green algae			0
these people are among thousands in @entity2 who rely on truck deliveries for their water supply to avoid the need to use this single tap a few enterprising people in the area have installed ground water pumps , but these are illegal			1
some others get their drinking water from @entity120			0
he has made a business of providing water to residents and businesses			0
every day , in the baking hot sun , he rides his bicycle around the neighbourhood , making five or six trips to fill a large water container , which is strapped to the back of his bike			1
he is pouring with sweat as he makes his deliveries			0
' there is no sanitation here , just so many complaints ' , he explains			0
' so i thought : " let me get a water filter and supply clean water to these people , in order to help them and make some money " '			2
@entity120 charges 10 rupees – not much more than 10 pence – per container			0
it is a price business owners can afford to pay ; but as most in the neighbourhood make less than £ 1.50 a day , it is beyond the budget of the majority			2
and so , for most people in the area , simply getting clean water to drink is a struggle they face every day			1
@entity5 's government is not blind to the issue , and has long fought to provide enough clean drinking water for the masses			1
the figures , however , make worrying reading			0
the country has 18 percent of the world 's population ; but only 4 percent of the world 's renewable water sources			1
what is more , there are major problems with leaks and pollution , which strip away the supply even further			0
mother of six @entity47 , pictured cleaning dishes outside her home , has to carry heavy buckets to and from the neighbourhood spigot to get water @entity181 @entity180 , an official with @entity5 's department of drinking water and sanitation , says rural @entity5 faces a whole range of issues that are depleting its water			1
' because rural drinking water is dependent on ground water , ground water levels are going down because of exploitation by irrigation , by farmers and by industries , we are forced to drill deeper and deeper for drinking water , ' he told @entity15			1
' and as we go deeper and deeper we find more and more contaminants			0
now we are finding nitrate , iron , and salinity			0
uranium is also involved in some places , ' he said			0
@entity5 has set a national river conservation plan in place , which it hopes will reduce the pollution in its rivers			2
the plan includes interception , diversion and treatment of sewage , as well as low - cost sanitation works on riverbanks , and electric or improved wood crematoria for funerals			2
but authorities concede that @entity5 is facing what they call ' water stress ' because of urbanisation , industrialisation and the ever - rising population			1
some people have installed illegal ground water pumps to avoid queuing with buckets at neighbourhood water taps in @entity2 according to the 2011 census , @entity5 ’s per capita water availability stands at 1,545 cubic meters , down from 1,816 cubic meters in the 2001 population count			1
this year an acute water shortage hit @entity2			1
the city relies on other states for much of its water supply , but now it is finding itself in a tug of war to get it because those other states are dealing with shortages too			2
while this fight goes on , entire neighbourhoods across @entity2 rely on trucks to bring in the only water supply			1
thirsty crowds emerge as soon as the truck becomes visible			0
mother @entity245 fills as large a bucket as possible , because the truck only comes to her area three times a week			2
underneath the water truck children squat with little buckets , which they use to collect the drops of water spilling from the undercarriage			2
' at times there are scuffles and we have to return empty handed , ' says @entity245			0
when every drop of water matters , the fight for it is ultimately a fight for survival			0
for @entity5 , and its capital city , it is a fight they simply have to win .			1
