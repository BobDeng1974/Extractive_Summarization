throughout his first year as a professional , @entity0 has refused to believe the hype			1
but after stopping @entity3 in the second round at @entity6 's @entity5 on saturday night , even he may now begin to dream			1
nine fights , nine wins , nine early nights and a first title to boot			2
not bad for a man who first laced up his gloves six years ago as a raw 18 - year - old			1
he was supposed to be a test			0
but with a grin that would make the @entity32 look solemn , @entity0 clobbered the @entity33 from pillar to post			0
twelve months ago at the same venue , @entity0 made his professional debut after a 12 - month hiatus following his @entity39 triumph			1
on that occasion , he relieved @entity41 of his unbeaten record but a year under the watchful eye of @entity44 has seen him grow into a menacing heavyweight			0
@entity0 made his customary cautious start , but it required just a handful of stiff jabs for him to throw off the shackles			0
@entity3 , a veteran of 47 fights , did at least throw back but his response was brief and limited and merely served to refocus the @entity27 man 's mind and sharpen his weapons			1
@entity55 followed right followed left as @entity3 's face reddened with every crushing blow while @entity0 stretched a smile around his mouth guard in sheer delight			1
@entity0 impressed against his @entity33 opponent who had n't been stopped in a decade @entity63 gestures as he prepares to have his arm raised as the new @entity66 heavyweight champion @entity0 celebrates victory in the ring with his team of trainers and promoter @entity71 ( right ) surviving to slump on his stool after three torrid minutes was an achievement in itself for the beleaguered visitor but his respite was cruelly short - lived			1
@entity0 , who is yet to go beyond the third round as a professional , laid siege immediately after the bell to start the second session			2
the referee stepped in but bizarrely allowed them to continue for several seconds before rescuing the stricken and bloodied @entity3			0
@entity0 said afterwards : ' he had n't been stopped so i just wanted to see what he could take			2
' he was a strong guy and he was n't an easy opponent but i wanted to make light work of him			0
it only went two rounds but i just wanted to hurt him			0
' and hurt him he did			0
the @entity66 belt now in his possession is little more than expensive bling			2
but the accompanying world ranking and chilling power will put the heavyweight division on red alert			0
@entity0 throws a punch as he dominates the bout against his @entity99 opponent in @entity6 on saturday night @entity3 looks to hit back but he was overwhelmed by @entity100 in a fight which was stopped in the second round			1

@entity0 stopped @entity3 in the second round in @entity6
the @entity27 fighter now has a record of nine wins from nine fights
@entity3 had not been stopped for a decade and fought 250 rounds more than @entity0 , who took up boxing just six years ago
with the win , @entity0 now holds the @entity66 heavyweight belt
