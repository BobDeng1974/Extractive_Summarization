it is the disease that is now responsible for one in four deaths in the western world			0
now , what may be the oldest case of cancer has been discovered in a 4,500 - year - old skeleton			2
archaeologists say that a @entity9 man succumbed to either lung or prostate cancer , as revealed by tell - tale marks on his bones			1
earliest victim ? what may be the oldest case of cancer has been discovered in a 4,500 - year - old skeleton ( pictured )			2
archaeologists say that a @entity9 man succumbed to either lung or prostate cancer , as revealed by tell - tale marks on his bones the early @entity23 man 's remains were exhumed from a small hunter - gatherer cemetery in the @entity25 of @entity9			1
‘ this represents one of the earliest cases of human cancer worldwide and the oldest case documented thus far from @entity35 , ’ said @entity26 , a bioarchaeologist at the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
older skeletons believed to be between 5,000 and 6,000 years old have yielded similar discoveries , but cancers were unconfirmed or tumours were found to be benign			0
analysing the @entity41 remains with @entity42 from @entity43 in @entity44 and @entity45 with @entity46 in @entity41 , dr @entity26 discovered that the cancer had riddled the ancient man ’s bones with from head to hip , including his upper arms and upper legs , and virtually all points between			1
as he lay dying , severe pain and fatigue would have been his constant companions , punctuated by periods of panic as he struggled to breathe , she said			1
the man 's age , sex and lesions on his bones point to lung cancer ( a magnified human lung cancer cell is shown ) or possible prostate cancer for his cause of death			1
experts found the cancer had riddled the ancient man ’s bones with from head to hip , including his upper arms and upper legs , and virtually all points between the man ’s community buried him in a foetal position in a circular pit after he died , according to the research published in the journal , @entity83			1
the cancer victim was buried with an ornamental bone and a bone spoon , intricately carved with a winding serpent handle			1
ancient skeletons bearing the scars of cancer are rare , leading some people to believe that the disease is a recent phenomenon caused by our modern lifestyles			2
however , this find provides evidence that refutes this hypothesis			0
dr @entity26 suspects that taking into account variables such as longer life expectancies , cancer may have been considerably more common in ancient times than is generally presumed			2
‘ as we become more familiar with what metastatic carcinoma looks like in the skeleton , the number of cases identified by bioarchaeological research is likely to increase , ’ she said			0
he is thought to have been between 35 and 40 years old when he died			0
this burial differed from most men ’s of the period , who were typically laid to rest on their backs with fishing or hunting gear			0
the researchers performed a battery of tests on the man , as if he had died recently and ruled out the possibility that he had died from tuberculosis or fungal diseases			2
they said that the most likely culprit was metastatic carcinoma – cancer that starts in one part of the body and spreads			2
‘ it ’s clear the disease had progressed considerably , metastasising far beyond its original location in the body and contributing to his death , ' dr @entity26 said			0
‘ his age and sex and the lesions on his bones point to lung cancer or possibly prostate cancer			1
’ the early @entity23 man 's remains were exhumed from a small hunter - gatherer cemetery near @entity146 ( shown on the map ) in the @entity25 region of @entity9 ancient skeletons bearing the scars of cancer are rare , leading some people to believe that the disease is a recent phenomenon caused by our modern lifestyles			1
the @entity23 man lived in a mountainous region with freshwater lakes and would have eaten a healthy diet of fish , game and fresh seasonal plants			1
however , this find provides evidence that refutes this hypothesis			0
dr @entity26 suspects that taking into account variables such as longer life expectancies , cancer may have been considerably more common in ancient times than is generally presumed			0
‘ as we become more familiar with what metastatic carcinoma looks like in the skeleton , the number of cases identified by bioarchaeological research is likely to increase , ’ she said			0
‘ a related example is scurvy			0
once we knew what scurvy does to the skeleton and became familiar with the signs , identification of the disease increased .			0
