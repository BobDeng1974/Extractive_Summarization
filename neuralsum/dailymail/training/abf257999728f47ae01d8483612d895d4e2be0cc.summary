using a rusting pair of scissors to trim his greying beard , @entity0 declares his love for the @entity5			2
‘ it is the queen who helps and protects her people , ’ he says , brushing the hair clippings from the duvet under which he has been sleeping rough			2
‘ @entity5 cares for her people — everyone knows that			2
that is why we came from @entity14 , so she can help us , too			1
’ the 52 - year - old @entity16 gipsy is one of about 30 @entity14 sleeping on a now grubby patch of grass on a central reservation in @entity22 ’s @entity21 near @entity23 scene of squalor : birds peck their way between the beggars sleeping rough in @entity21 - one of @entity22 's most expensive addresses the rag - tag encampment with rows of soiled duvets , battered suitcases and cardboard boxes is in stark contrast to the nearby luxury car showrooms and pristine @entity38 terraces			1
as the city comes to life shortly after dawn , bare feet are thrust into grimy trainers and flip - flops , and lighters flare as the first cigarettes of the day are sparked up			2
the younger women are dispatched to get coffee from a café while the older women roll up the duvets and cram them into dustbin liners			2
early morning joggers in @entity54 have to dodge the @entity14 who have gone to find a secluded spot to use as a toilet			1
sleeping it off : a @entity14 uses duvets and a mattress to turn a park bench into a bed			1
' we 're waiting for your government to give us jobs and somewhere to live , ' says their leader @entity0 , a stocky man with deep brown skin , grins to reveal a solitary crooked tooth			2
he acts as leader of the group and with a single wave of his hand silences younger men who dare to speak			1
‘ we want to find work			0
we did not come here to commit crime or beg , ’ he says			0
‘ at the moment the only thing we do all day is scavenge for food in the rubbish bins			0
‘ we hope that someone from the government will intervene and give us work and shelter , somewhere to live			0
’ despite his protestations , it is believed that some of the @entity14 beg on the streets of the @entity88			1
they have also been linked to pickpocketing gangs , as well as age - old scams such as pretending to have found a ‘ gold ’ ring on the street which they then sell for £ 20 to someone gullible			0
rise and shine : the women prepare to spend the day begging for money and scavenging for food @entity99 , leader of @entity100 , says : ‘ there is an influx of these @entity14 every year and it is a source of absolute frustration			1
the government has to do more			0
' i think we are particularly vulnerable and the @entity107 may be an easy touch compared to other countries			0
there ’s also a sense of intimidation with aggressive begging			0
‘ it is costing the council a huge amount of money to tackle the problem and that ’s money we do not have			0
the residents and business community are not happy			0
’ @entity0 , a father of four , arrived from @entity123 , northern @entity14 , by bus at @entity126 coach station just over a month ago			1
he and his family decided to sleep rough in @entity23 because it is near a series of subways that offer shelter if it rains			1
first cigarette of the day : a gipsy lights up while another huddles in blankets among the camp 's detritus @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity54 are minutes away , as well as some of the most affluent neighbourhoods such as @entity142 and @entity143			2
councillor @entity144 , responsible at @entity100 for community protection , says : ‘ we are spending thousands of pounds cleaning up after rough sleepers			1
‘ the particular problem here is largely with @entity16 people who have @entity14 identity cards , some of whom drift into low - level crime , nuisance and intimidation			1
’ @entity157 and @entity14 gained the right to visa - free travel to the @entity107 in 2007 when their countries joined the @entity161			1
bagged up : it is the women 's job to put the duvets in plastic sacks to keep dry the open - borders policy means they can enter @entity107 legally and then have three months to prove they can support themselves			2
if not , the @entity170 can have them removed			0
many people are concerned that the crisis of @entity173 living on the streets will deepen from january 2014 when all 29 million citizens of @entity14 and @entity157 gain full rights to live , work and claim benefits here under @entity161 ‘ freedom of movement ’ rules			1
@entity0 , who refused to give his full name , remains determined to stay in the capital over the summer			0
‘ i have n’t been stopped by the police , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity22 is very beautiful			1
perhaps the @entity5 will drive past us one day and take pity on us			0
that is what we hope			0

a group of 30 @entity14 are camped out near @entity23 in @entity22
leader of @entity100 says it 's ' a source of absolute frustration '
