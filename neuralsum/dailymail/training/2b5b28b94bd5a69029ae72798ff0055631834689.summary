click here for @entity3 's brilliant @entity2 @entity1 @entity4 : @entity5 @entity6 : @entity5 host commentator @entity4 take on @entity9 next in @entity10 , they 're going to have to improve to trouble @entity12 side			1
king @entity14 though , eh ? meanwhile , @entity6 take on @entity15			1
that 's all from me tonight , i hope you enjoyed the coverage here			0
all over here , i 'm thankful the second half improved ! the heat made it difficult to play with a quick tempo , but both teams seemed content with a draw			1
@entity28 's mistake will live long in the memory ... 90 +4mins : all over ? @entity30 gets in down the left and plays the ball across the six yard box , but @entity34 slices it wide at the back post			1
90mins : @entity4 in the ascendancy , they have been much more positive in the last 20 minutes or so			1
85mins : just five minutes left here , and you have to say it 's been an entertaining second half			0
i guess anything would be considered exciting after those first 45 minutes though ! can either team nick a crucial winner ? 79mins : what now ? this game has certainly livened up			0
unbelievable ! @entity4 equalise immediately			1
they look so much better with two up front , and @entity51 capitalises after a goalmouth scramble			1
four years ago @entity14 had to watch on as @entity53 dropped a clanger for @entity55 against @entity56			1
i think this ones worse ... 71mins : @entity14 going for it now , on comes another striker			1
this is one of the worst goalkeeping howlers you will ever see			0
and i 'm sorry @entity28 , but this game needed it			1
substitute @entity67 shoots speculatively from 30 yards , straight at the @entity69 goalkeeper , who practically throws it into his own net			1
really , just ... awful			0
66mins : superb ball in from @entity74 from the left , and to be fair to @entity6 's goalkeeper he deals with this one well , pucnhing the ball clear			1
62mins : few players dropping with cramp at the moment			0
me too lads , me too ... 58mins : on comes the @entity83 , the top scorer from @entity84 as a youngster			0
dubbed as the next @entity86 , can he inspire @entity4 here ? 56mins : off goes the former @entity89 striker , who just like his days in the @entity90 , was ineffective tonight			1
50mins : this half is much more promising			0
@entity92 hits a swerving shot from long range and @entity28 only just parries on the second attempt			2
48mins : another harsh booking here , this time for a @entity69 player			2
@entity98 is slightly late , but i reckon that was his first foul			0
46mins : great start to the second half from @entity4			2
@entity104 has a shot tipped over the bar before @entity107 nods a header into the side netting			0
no goals at the break then ... we have n't seen a goal since around 6pm ( bst )			0
@entity6 had the best chances in that half and but for some wayward finishing would be in front			2
@entity14 needs to install some belief into his @entity4 side , they surely need to go for it			1
43mins : looks like we 're going to be goalless at half - time			0
players trying to pace themselves in this 80 degree humidity			0
38mins : what a chance this is for @entity128 yet again			0
he dances into the box and creates space to shoot but blazes it miles over the bar			0
34mins : another long range shot , this time from @entity136 , the shot is deflected and with @entity28 rooted , would have found the net had it been on target			2
33mins : better from @entity4			2
@entity139 feeds @entity140 on the left - hand side who drives towards the box			0
he elects to shoot but gets all wrong , kicking the ground and it 's a goal kick			2
30mins : another harsh booking for @entity6 , for what seemed to be a 50/50			2
the resulting free - kick is blasted towards goal by @entity104 and the ball has to be beaten away by the goalkeeper			0
27mins : at the moment @entity4 are only looking dangerous from corners			2
@entity153 just about manages to claw the latest set - piece away			0
dare i say it , this game needs a goal ... 22mins : i mentioned earlier that @entity4 were the favourites for this , especially after @entity6 lost to @entity160 4 - 0 in their final warm - up game			1
but the @entity164 side are holding their own , with the @entity69 crying out for some invention			2
17mins : not impressed by @entity4 at all so far			2
it 's slow , steady and they 're lacking creativity			0
dare i say it reminds me of @entity55 in 2010 ? 13mins : we saw a lenient referee earlier on , but this is ridiculous			1
@entity136 is booked , but he barely touched @entity34 , who made the most of it			0
10mins : more lovely play from @entity6 ! a fabulous touh from @entity177 sets up @entity136 , but he is a bit selfish and goes for goal himself from the edge of the box instead of laying it off to @entity183			2
he eventually blasts his shot over the bar			0
8mins : decent bit of movement from @entity136 , who dances past a couple of challenges			0
@entity4 have had a corner early on but little threat other than that - they seem to be lacking pace on the wing			2
4mins : @entity4 looking to force the pace early on , but @entity6 have already shown some technical quality on the ball			1
@entity200 's @entity199 is one to look out for , and he will look to get some joy against an aging defence			0
away we go ! surely not another 0 - 0 draw ? let 's hope for an entertaining game			0
look out for @entity30 for @entity4 tonight , the 23 - year - old has a fine record in his home country			2
it is their first @entity2 appearance since 2002 , coincidentally the year @entity6 made the semi-finals ... @entity136 is the danger man for them , and he is partnered up front by former @entity89 flop @entity215			1
@entity4 have only kept one clean sheet in their last six @entity2 games , it was against @entity220 on june 5 , 2002 ( 2 - 0 )			1
this is @entity6 ’s eighth @entity2 in a row ( since 1986 ) ; only @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 can boast a longer streak currently			1
@entity6 have only won two of their last 10 @entity2 games ( against @entity230 in 2006 and @entity231 in 2010 )			1
the one previous meeting between @entity4 and @entity6 came in a friendly in november 2013 ; @entity14 ’s side won 2 - 1			1
including games played as @entity236 , @entity4 have lost seven of their last 10 @entity2 games , winning the other three			1
@entity6 have kicked off each of the last three @entity240 with a win : v @entity242 in 2002 , @entity230 in 2006 and @entity231 in 2010			1
@entity6 have scored the most direct free - kicks in the @entity2 since 1990 ( 5 )			1
@entity30 was the youngest player to score 10 or more goals in the @entity245 in 2013 - 14 ; he was born in march 1991			0
@entity6 captain @entity246 said ' i do n't know the ( @entity69 ) names themselves			1
but i know their numbers			0
' rewind four years ago , and @entity14 was slammed in the press after a poor performance in @entity254 with @entity55			1
can he make up for it with his @entity4 side tonight ? they qualified convincingly and will be the slight favourites for this one			0
never rule out the @entity260 though ... @entity153 ; @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 ; @entity266 - @entity265 , @entity267 , @entity269 - @entity268 , @entity199 ; @entity215 , @entity136 - @entity128 @entity28 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity30 , @entity272 , @entity98 , @entity140 , @entity34 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity74 hello and welcome to @entity3 's coverage as @entity4 take on @entity6 in @entity10 these are the last teams yet to play in this summer 's @entity2			1
