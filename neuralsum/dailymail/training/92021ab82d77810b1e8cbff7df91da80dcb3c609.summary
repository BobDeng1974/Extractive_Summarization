by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 and his team at @entity4 have had their ethics questioned by one of the leading anti-doping advocates in cycling on the eve of the @entity10			1
in a fascinating interview with @entity13 , @entity11 also warns that cycling ’s rejection of @entity16 could have dire consequences			1
‘ i do n’t want to hear that he has been found hanging from a ceiling , because i think it is possible , ’ said the @entity19 former professional rider			1
speaking in @entity37 on friday to promote his updated autobiography - ‘ a clean break ’ - @entity11 said it was wrong for @entity2 to race in april ’s @entity40 using a @entity33 for an asthma medication			1
@entity2 was not in breach of @entity44 or @entity45 rules but @entity11 thinks @entity4 and @entity46 have been exposed compromising their principles			1
‘ doping is about eliminating all obstacles to win a race , ’ said @entity11			1
‘ i ask myself a lot of questions about @entity4			1
i have the impression that they talk a lot and say a lot of things because they do n't want to talk about other things			2
‘ the fact is @entity2 has shown his mentality by taking this product			1
he had a problem , he was ill and he took this product			2
he eliminated the obstacle to him winning			0
‘ it 's not that different from taking @entity35 because you 're tired and your haematocrit is low			2
just because it 's legal , it comes down to the same mentality			0
‘ @entity16 said years ago : “ i 've been tested 500 times and never tested positive			1
” that 's the same mentality guys have got today			0
they just do n't want to test positive			2
' mr clean ' : @entity11 was renowned for his refusal to dope and quit cycling after outing doping use @entity2 , 29 , gb @entity81 , 29 , australia @entity84 @entity83 , 28 , gb @entity85 , 30 , @entity86 @entity87 , 33 , austria @entity89 , 32 , belarus @entity91 , 33 , @entity86 @entity92 , 35 , @entity93 @entity94 , 37 , @entity86 ‘ it 's not about where the authorities draw the line , because people thinking about that are also only thinking the priority is not to test positive			1
‘ my dad was a bricklayer			0
if he was ill he would n't take a drug so he could carry on , he 'd go home and rest			2
there seems to be this obligation with @entity4 to perform at any cost			1
’ as a rider @entity11 earned the nickname ‘ @entity112 ’ because of his refusal to dope , even though he was a member of the @entity115 team that was busted for carrying doping products in a team car just before the start of the @entity119			1
a year later he would write a newspaper column claiming the peloton was riddled with drug cheats , leading to an infamous confrontation with @entity16 during the race			1
two years later he retired from cycling disillusioned			0
a courageous man who for the last 10 years has worked in anti-doping in his native @entity19 - he tries to educate young athletes against the dangers of drugs in sport - @entity11 said on friday he could see unfavourable comparisons between @entity4 and the @entity132 team that dominated the tour under the leadership of @entity16			1
pose : @entity11 feels there are comparisons between @entity4 and the @entity132 team unfavourable comparisons : @entity4 have been linked to the infamous team led by @entity16 by @entity11 high spirits : @entity4 won the last two tours under sir @entity141 and then @entity2 ( pictured , left ) @entity142 @entity143 @entity144 @entity145 @entity147 - @entity146 @entity148 @entity149 ( wild - card team ) @entity151 ( wild - card team ) @entity153 @entity155 - @entity154 @entity156 @entity158 - @entity157 @entity159 @entity160 ( wild - card team ) @entity162 @entity163 @entity164 @entity165 @entity166 ( wild - card team ) @entity168 @entity169 @entity170 @entity4 @entity4 have won the last two tours under sir @entity141 and then @entity2 , with the latter favourite to win the race for a second time this year			1
‘ what 's also true is @entity4 have definitely gone against a lot of received knowledge in the sport , ’ he said			1
‘ there were a lot of things we thought were n't possible and they 've shown that they are possible			2
‘ they have a collective force like @entity132 had			1
they communicate with @entity184 did and they seem to produce riders who do n't have any muscles and are very powerful			2
‘ twenty years ago , almost , it was @entity115 , 10 years later it was @entity16			1
i do n't want to say that in the next few years @entity2 is going to be the next big scandal , but what they ought to do if they 've got nothing to hide is communicate differently and stop communicating in that way , like @entity132 used to do			1
’ @entity4 insisted earlier this week that it abided by the rules			1
in friday 's press conference , @entity4 principal sir @entity197 said : ‘ we set out to try to win this race with a @entity201 rider and ride clean and we 've achieved that			1
‘ we 're a clean team , we play by the rules			1
we are happy that @entity45 is happy with us and we are happy that the @entity44 is happy with us			0
’ @entity203 also argued that it was wrong that a former doper , @entity206 , is a team principal for @entity208 in this year ’s race			2
‘ in 1999 @entity16 was far from alone in doping , ’ he said			1
' everyone was doing it			0
it ’d not acceptable that people like @entity206 are still in the sport when we are trying to restore the credibility of cycling			0
we know now he was a doper and yet he is working as a cycling commentator on @entity19 television , on a public channel i pay for with my television licence			2
i am paying for @entity219			0
’ questionable ? @entity227 team principal @entity206 is a former doper in cycling bassons met up with @entity16 in @entity231 last december , giving the @entity93 the opportunity to apologise for the way he had treated him			1
‘ i compare the 1999 @entity16 to the 2013 @entity16 and they were two completely different men , ’ said @entity11			1
‘ i saw a very tired man			1
he could n’t look you in the eye			2
in 1999 he never dropped his gaze			0
now he was scratching the table			0
he drank two glasses of vodka before the interview and he drank afterwards as well			1
‘ i work in anti-doping with young people and i do n’t always agree with the message the anti-doping bodies put out ; about this war on drugs that is all about protecting people ’s health			2
because the war on drugs quite clearly has n’t protected everyone ’s health			0
‘ @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , they ’re not dead because of doping			0
they are dead because of the way they were rejected			0
exhausted : @entity11 said of @entity16 ( pictured in 2004 for the @entity266 ) , he saw a ' very tired man ' different : a ' nervous ' @entity16 ' drank two glasses of vodka before the interview ' claims @entity11 ‘ maybe @entity16 is stronger than i imagine but i do n’t want to hear that he has been found hanging from a ceiling , because i think it is possible			1
‘ in 1999 most riders were using drugs and others would have done the same thing as him			0
they would have acted in the same way and created the same system around them but they were n’t as strong and as intelligent as him			0
‘ by creating that system he created a lot of bitterness towards himself and now people are jumping on the bandwagon and trying to make themselves look good by condemning him			0
‘ but they are not assuming responsibility for their actions and what they did at the time			0
’ the @entity44 have ordered an independent inquiry into cycling ’s doping past - @entity293 - in the wake of the @entity16 revelations of last year			2
‘ i have n’t spoken to @entity293 , ’ he said			0
‘ every 10 years or so cycling has something like this			0
we had @entity115 in 98 and then the @entity16 affair			2
now we have this thing with @entity2 and the @entity33 , and it seems like @entity45 and the @entity44 might have facilitated something that should n’t have happened			2
we should be looking at the present			0
' i do n’t like talking about the past , even though i am here , because the focus needs to be on the present and what is happening now			0
that ’s where we should be focusing our energy			0
‘ it ’s ridiculous we are focusing our energy on something that happened 10 years ago when @entity206 is still the manager of a team			2
‘ it is harder to dope these days because the tests are much more sensitive			0
but the biological passport is a problem			0
it ’s a shield everyone hides behind but it has good things and bad things			0
‘ riders can take microdoses of drugs like @entity35			0
you are not tested between 9pm and 6am and if you take a microdose of @entity35 at 9.01 pm it will not be detectable by 6am the next morning			0
i know the mentality has n’t changed in cycling			0
