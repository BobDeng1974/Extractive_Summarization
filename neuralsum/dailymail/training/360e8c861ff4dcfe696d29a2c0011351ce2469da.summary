@entity1 boss @entity0 has predicted that the much - vaunted third runway for @entity3 will never be built because dithering politicians lack the courage to make tough decisions			1
as a result , @entity3 will be overtaken permanently next year by @entity8 as the world ’s busiest airport , he said			1
mr @entity0 warned the situation could force airlines including @entity1 , which has its own terminal at the airport , to base themselves elsewhere – resulting in @entity16 job losses and stunted economic growth			1
@entity16 @entity1 boss @entity0 ( pictured ) has predicted @entity3 's third runway will not happen because dithering politicians lack the courage to make tough decisions the withering attack came just hours after @entity23 airports tsar sir @entity22 launched a 12 - week consultation into @entity16 airport expansion			1
three options are on the table : two rival plans at @entity3 – one for a third runway and another to extend an existing one – and an option for a second runway at @entity33			1
however , mr @entity0 , ceo of @entity1 ’s parent company , the @entity34 , said that ‘ like many other world - class reports ’ , it would gather dust on a shelf and never be implemented			1
‘ politicians wo n’t be brave enough to grasp the nettle			2
i do n’t think we have the politicians in place who will deal with it , ’ he said			2
@entity16 ’s political class lacked vision and had ‘ given up on world ambition , ’ he added			2
sir @entity22 also warned of the economic damage to the @entity16 if politicians failed to act speedily on his final report due just after the general election in may next year			1
he said of the next government : ‘ if they duck that , they will pay			0
we are reaching then end of the runway			0
’ but mr @entity0 said : ‘ maybe i am cynical but i remain totally convinced that nothing will actually happen			2
’ sir @entity22 ’s commission says an extra runway at @entity3 or @entity33 will cost billions of pounds more than predicted - pictured is @entity3 's terminal 5 during a q&a session with veteran @entity66 broadcaster @entity65 at the @entity68 annual conference in @entity69 , mr @entity0 said he had already planned @entity1 ’s future on the basis that neither @entity3 nor @entity33 will expand			1
he said : ‘ growth in the @entity16 will be constricted			2
but my business does n’t just relate to @entity3			2
we will continue to grow			0
not all of that growth will be at @entity3			2
’ he said that because @entity1 was part of @entity34 , with sister @entity80 airline @entity79 based in @entity81 , they had the flexibility to expand abroad			0
mr @entity0 said that the gulf state of @entity8 was expanding its airports massively			2
‘ next year they will overtake @entity3 as the busiest airport in the world , ’ he said			1
@entity88 currently has two runways			0
in the first three months of this year it overtook @entity3 as the busiest airport in the world , before falling back because of work on its runways			1
mr @entity0 said @entity8 's airport ( pictured ) will soon overtake @entity3 ' as the busiest airport in the world ' mr @entity0 added : ‘ once the work has been completed they are expected to overtake us by quarterly passenger traffic early next year			1
’ and @entity8 said in september that it planned to invest £ 20 billion in a mega-hub airport in the desert to accommodate 240 million passengers a year , dwarfing the 72 million passengers that @entity3 serves			1
mr @entity0 said @entity8 had support from politicians and business leaders with ‘ vision and real aspiration ’			1
he pointed out that the terms of sir @entity22 ’s @entity112 consultation was to ensure that the @entity16 remained only as the major hub ‘ in @entity115 ’			1
mr @entity0 said of @entity16 politicians : ‘ they have given up on world ambition			1
we ’ve gone from world ambition to @entity115 ambition			0
what next ? it ’s disappointing			0
’ sir @entity22 ’s commission says an extra runway at @entity3 or @entity33 will cost billions of pounds more than predicted			1
a new @entity126 airport favoured by @entity127 has already been ruled out , although the @entity69 mayor still insists it is the best option			0
airport security is becoming so extreme that passengers could be forced to walk through scanners ‘ in hospital gowns ’ , @entity0 said			1
he claimed many checks , including rules on liquids , were unnecessary and simply caused long queues			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ [ security is ] still the most frustrating part of the customer journey that i experience			2
it ’s also the area that frustrates our customers most			0
‘ you are still taking off your shoes , which i ’m sure is not necessary			0
we ’re taking everything out of our bag when there ’s technology which can deal with that			0
’ he added : ‘ in ten years ’ time you will have to go through security in a hospital gown			0
you wo n’t be allowed to wear clothes			0
’ he said that if security chiefs started with a blank piece of paper , they would dispense with many of the checks , and complained of confusing inconsistencies in the rules			0
he told the @entity68 annual conference in @entity69 : ‘ sometimes you have to take your @entity169 out , other times you can leave it in			0
some tell you to take your shoes off , others to keep them on			0
belt on ? belt off			0
‘ why is it i can have my @entity169 in my bag this time , but not the next time ? these are things which do n’t make sense			0
’ when challenged that airport bosses did not believe it was an issue , mr @entity0 retorted : ‘ that ’s not what my customers tell me			1
