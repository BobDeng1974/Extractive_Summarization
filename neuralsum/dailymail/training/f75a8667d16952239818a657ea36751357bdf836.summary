by @entity1 reporter published : 08:01 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 09:19 est , 21 august 2012 inmates were fed meat intended for animal consumption after a major meat manufacturer in eastern @entity6 incorrectly labelled some of its product , according to federal authorities			0
the @entity11 government conducted a three - year investigation on @entity13 , a @entity15 , @entity6 - based meat processing facility specialising in value - added fajita meat			0
they alleged that some beef tips that could not be frozen properly were sold to a third - party meat broker who agreed to sell the meat as pet food			1
however , some of those beef tips made it to the mess halls of several prisons			2
meat market : @entity29 in @entity15 , @entity6 , allegedly did not change meat labels after the product was deemed suitable as pet food branded : the beef tips were designated for pet food , but a meat wholesaler sold a portion of the product to the @entity37 for human consumption ( stock photo ) federal authorities with the @entity11 @entity41 and the @entity42 conducted a three - year investigation over the alleged meat mix - up , according to the @entity45			1
they found that in 2006 and 2007 , the broker sold some of the now animal - grade meat to another wholesaler , who in turn sold the beef to the @entity54 , breaking its agreement with @entity56			1
none of the boxes were re-labelled as pet food			2
@entity11 attorney @entity60 told the @entity61 that @entity62 will tighten policies to comply with meat inspection laws and pay $ 392,000 to reimburse costs of the three - year investigation			0
mistake : @entity56 turned to a meat wholesaler to sell the now pet - grade meat , but the contractor pleaded guilty to selling it to the @entity54 , right , who then served the meat to inmates @entity74 says there 's no evidence anyone became sick from the lower - grade beef			1
a lawyer for the meat product company told the @entity45 that there was no specific law requiring @entity56 to re-label the beef tips after they were branded as pet food			2
@entity85 told the paper that the independent broker pleaded guilty to federal charges against them			0
however , prosecutors wo n't press civil or criminal charges against the fajita processing and marketing company .			0

@entity29 had *difficulty* *freezing* one batch of beef tips , which were then *classified* as pet food and passed on to wholesale broker to sell
however , boxes were never re-labeled as pet food
broker then sold pet - grade meat to @entity54
