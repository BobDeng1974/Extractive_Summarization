@entity1 breached standards by allowing singers @entity3 and @entity5 to swear during a pre-watershed broadcast , watchdog @entity0 ruled yesterday			1
the @entity7 is now set to put up signs in dressing rooms warning stars performing live that they will be pulled off air if they use foul language			1
the clampdown comes after miss @entity3 said ‘ f * * * ’ six times in her set at the @entity17 in may , broadcast on @entity1 from 5.30pm to 6.15pm			1
@entity7 said it had considered cutting away from @entity19 's set twice during her performance , but a senior producer decided to continue because apologies had been given and it was believed that few children would be listening it emerged the corporation knew miss @entity3 planned to sing songs with explicit lyrics but assumed she would ‘ self - edit ’ out offensive language			1
the @entity7 said it twice considered cutting away from her but that a producer thought few children would be listening and that there had been adequate warnings			0
bosses admitted this was a mistake , telling @entity0 it should have stopped broadcasting after miss @entity3 ’s second song and aired the rest after editing out any swearing			2
according to @entity7 figures , 654,000 listeners tuned in for the set – well before the 7pm radio watershed – including around 25,600 aged between 10 and 14			2
before miss @entity3 took to the stage , presenter @entity46 warned listeners her songs could contain foul language			1
he apologised each time she swore and after the performance			0
@entity5 also said ‘ f * * * * * * ’ on stage			1
@entity5 said ' f * * * * * g ' just before 7pm in the @entity57 show but the @entity7 said swear words were ' relatively rare ' and were always followed by an immediate apology , while @entity0 said @entity19 was known to use strong language and ' it was reasonably predictable that her set could contain the most offensive language ' , it ruled the @entity7 has been deluged with complaints over a ‘ hatchet job ’ @entity67 episode about @entity68			1
the programme , which was broadcast last week , contained a raft of allegations about the party and its leader @entity73 , who was described as ‘ back - stabbing ’			0
in the following days , the @entity7 received some 800 complaints accusing it of bias , according to its programme @entity76			0
viewers described the report , entitled @entity80 and fronted by @entity81 , as ‘ mud - slinging ’ , and ‘ a hatchet job ’ , with one commenting : ‘ it ’s no surprise @entity73 refused to be interviewed			0
surely every story has two sides ? ’ @entity68 pointed out that many of the report ’s allegations , such as questions over party funds , had first appeared several years ago			0
in a voice - over , mr @entity81 said @entity68 ‘ preaches accountability so why are they so careful about what questions they answer ? ’ he added : ‘ @entity73 says he ’s a straight talker so why have so many colleagues quit in disgust ? ’ interviewee dr @entity100 , @entity68 ’s director of research from 1999 to 2003 , said : ‘ he ’s socially very skilled ... but behind your back he ’ll be stabbing you			0
@entity104 has got nothing on @entity73			0
’ panorama editor @entity106 said staff had ‘ tried our very best to make this a balanced , fair , impartial programme ’ even though mr @entity73 refused to participate			0
the @entity7 insisted artists were reminded not to swear and that many changed songs accordingly			2
it claimed it sought to give ‘ adequate warnings ’ about expletives			0
but @entity0 said it was ‘ concerned [ the @entity7 ] did not take more measures … to ensure compliance [ with broadcasting guidelines ] … when children were particularly likely to be listening ’			2
the @entity120 said the incident was a ‘ serious breach ’ of editorial guidelines			1
it added that @entity1 will likely add signs to stars ’ dressing rooms saying ‘ strong language will result in your performance being dropped from @entity1 ’s live coverage ’ .			1
