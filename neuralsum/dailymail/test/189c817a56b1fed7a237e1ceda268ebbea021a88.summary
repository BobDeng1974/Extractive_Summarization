social media star : @entity30 , fitness blogger and avid yogi will star in the we are handsome show this self - regulated approach has also been taken by new @entity23 brand @entity166 & @entity168 who cast healthy , @entity34 sensation @entity169 for their debut collection			0
' after the collection went live online yesterday we had great consumer and industry feedback , ' says @entity177 who represents the label			0
' they loved that we were using a woman that was n't a typical sample size and who is comfortable in her own skin			0
' crave comfort : @entity166 & @entity168 have found women like seeing models who are comfortable in their own skin leading the way in size range too , @entity166 & @entity168 have chosen to make resort wear that goes from size 0 up to 26 and swimwear that includes bigger cup sizes too , with cups sizes going up to a double @entity197 ' @entity168 found there was a gap in market and she needed to design for women that are bigger and bustier and people that were able to feel empowered and comfortable in a bigger bikini or kaftan			2
