by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale the differing standards of hotel accommodation allocated to the @entity5 @entity4 pundits in @entity6 is n’t going to help build much team spirit among the all - star cast			1
@entity9 is staying in the grandest of @entity6 ’s hotels , the @entity12 , along with @entity14 president @entity13 and the @entity15 , while @entity16 and his personal trainer , plus @entity18 , are in the equally plush @entity19 on @entity12			1
meanwhile @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , despite being the mainstay of the @entity5 ’s domestic coverage on @entity25 , are in a very modest hotel nearby , along with the rest of the @entity5 ’s football foot soldiers			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity30 and sale with fans on the @entity12 beach disparity : @entity9 and @entity16 ( left ) are in luxury while other @entity5 pundits stay in more modest surroundings @entity9 is said to be paying for his own accommodation , while @entity16 is footing the bill for the trainer keeping him fit for his @entity41 return			1
but @entity18 and @entity16 being given a higher standard of hotel than the rest was part of their contractual agreement			2
a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ we are staying in a very competitively priced hotel close to our production base , as befits a frugal @entity5			1
‘ there is no problem among the talent and we have the best team spirit i can remember at a major tournament			0
’ mind you , @entity58 said the same and look what happened to them			0
@entity62 has recovered sufficiently from the trauma of losing his job at @entity65 after less than a season to take a pundit role for part of the @entity4			2
return : @entity62 will join @entity69 and @entity70 as a pundit for @entity72 in @entity73 for one week but @entity62 , who turned down advances from the @entity5 and @entity75 earlier in the year because he was concerned about a backlash from @entity65 fans , has chosen to go to @entity73 rather than @entity6			1
he will be a studio analyst for @entity72 for a week , even if it means having to work with @entity69 and @entity70			2
a spat broke out between the @entity5 ’s @entity80 and @entity82 ’s @entity81 as to who should ask the first question in @entity86 ’s final broadcast media conference in @entity6			1
it was @entity80 ’s turn in the rotation agreement with @entity75 and @entity82 , but @entity81 argued he had never had that opportunity when @entity86 was in the chair			1
after 20 minutes of wrangling they agreed to toss a coin , but before that happened @entity86 and captain @entity96 came into the room			2
@entity80 and @entity81 both put up a hand for the microphone and the @entity100 chose @entity82 to go first			1
lucky @entity102 manager @entity101 has kept his media roles at the @entity4 despite @entity104 revealing his accreditation pass was withdrawn by @entity14 after he blatantly broke the strict non-transferable rule by giving it to someone else to gain entry to @entity111 training			0
@entity113 tv network @entity112 , who have @entity101 as one of their pundits , say he will be working from their production studios in @entity6 for which he only needs an @entity112 pass to gain entry			2
the @entity119 said @entity101 would continue as one of their columnists			0
lucky : @entity101 has kept his jobs with @entity112 and the @entity119 despite being banned from @entity4 stadiums @entity125 shows @entity100 the way the @entity58 party will be retreating en masse from @entity128 tonight with none of @entity86 ’s coaching staff staying on at the tournament to see what they might learn			1
their brief stay in @entity128 contrasts with that of former @entity100 vice-chairman @entity125 , who will be watching his 13th game of the @entity4 when @entity58 take on @entity137 and intends to see 25 games in all			0
@entity125 , spotted boarding a private jet at @entity140 , is wealthy enough to have fast planes at his disposal taking him from game to game			0
but surely the @entity100 should have found an administrator keen enough on football to embrace the @entity4 in the same way			0
such a figure would have been far more useful in their delegation than the blazers who were just here for a jolly			0
@entity154 , who has replaced @entity155 as @entity58 ’s left back , might end up doing the same at @entity156			0
replacement : @entity154 ( lef ) has taken @entity155 's place for @entity58 , and @entity159 wants him at @entity156 as well @entity160 boss @entity159 has made it clear on his summer travels that he has @entity154 on his radar , although that was before the @entity102 defender had a nightmare @entity4 , especially in the opening defeat by @entity168 .			0

@entity9 staying in the @entity170 , @entity16 in the @entity19
@entity5 's other pundits are in a much smaller hotel with majority of staff
spokesman says it is right move for ' a frugal @entity5 '
@entity62 is workig as a guest pundit in @entity73 for @entity72
@entity5 ’s @entity80 and @entity82 ’s @entity81 fall out over who got to ask @entity86 the first question at final *pre-match* conference
@entity186 keeps his @entity112 job , despite stadium ban
