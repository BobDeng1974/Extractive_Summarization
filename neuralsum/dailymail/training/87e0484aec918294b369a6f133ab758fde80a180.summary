these are the shocking injuries suffered by a @entity2 teenager after her father used diesel fuel to try and clean a burn on her foot			1
@entity7 , 13 , initially scalded her toes while carrying a pan of hot water from the stove to the bath at her home in southern province of @entity17			2
her worried father @entity18 , 43 , did not have any medication to hand , but was told by a neighbour that diesel fuel would solve the problem by numbing the pain			1
' but unfortunately the fumes from the diesel were ignited by an open fire in the family kitchen , turning the girl 's legs into a fireball which quickly set her clothing alight as well			1
the girl 's mother , @entity64 , was also burned after rushing to try to help put out the flames covering her daughter 's legs			0
by the time the flames were extinguished , @entity7 had burns covering all four of her limbs , and her lower torso			0
@entity18 took both of them to hospital , where medics revealed his daugher had suffered third - degree burns to 60 per cent of her body			2
doctor @entity81 said : ' for a while it seemed as if she might not even survive			0
blunder : father @entity18 said a neighbour told him the fuel would numb the wound , and cool it as it evaporated on the brink : medics in @entity2 's southern @entity17 province said it was doubtful that @entity7 would survive at first , but her condition is now stable ' however she is now on the road to recovery although she will need extensive cosmetic surgery and skin grafts to get any sort of normal appearance in the future			1
' it 's going to be at least five months before she can probably even walk again			0
' he added : ' the father had taken the fuel from his motorbike			0
using diesel fuel to treat a burn is medically completely pointless and indeed , in this case , potentially deadly			0
' @entity18 's wife , who was not named , suffered second - degree burns on her calf , and was able to walk again in a week			2
recovering : doctors say @entity7 will now need extensive skin grafts to her body , and it may be five months before she is able to walk again hurt : @entity7 's mother , who was not named , also suffered second - degree burns to her calf as she tried to extinguish the flames covering her daughter 's body			1
