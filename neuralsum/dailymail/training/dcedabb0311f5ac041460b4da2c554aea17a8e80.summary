by @entity1 reporter published : 20:39 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 10:51 est , 14 august 2012 butterflies in @entity3 are suffering from ' serious abnormality ' following the radioactive fallout after the @entity7 nuclear disaster			1
scientists found unusually small wings and mutations in the legs and antennae of insects collected in may last year , two months after the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck			1
the radiation exposure harmed their genes and the damage could be passed on to future generations , according the journal @entity21			1
contrast : a healthy adult pale grass blue butterfly ( top ) and a mutated variety ( bottom ) with shriveled wings			0
it said that ' artificial radionuclides from the @entity7 ( no 1 ) nuclear power plant caused physiological and genetic damage ' to pale grass blue butterflies , a common species in @entity3			1
' sensitivity ( to irradiation ) varies between species , so research should be conducted on other animals , ' said @entity39 , a team member and associate professor at the @entity41 in @entity42			0
' humans are totally different from butterflies and they should be far more resistant ' to the health effects of radiation , @entity39 noted			0
genetically altered : one of the mutated adult pale grass blue butterflies found in @entity7 , @entity3 the researchers collected 121 adult pale grass blue butterflies in and outside @entity53 in may 2011 , two months after the nuclear crisis started			1
abnormalities such as unusually small wings were found in 12 per cent of the total			1
but the rate rose to 18 per cent in a second generation produced through mating among the butterflies collected and some even died before reaching adulthood			1
when second generation butterflies with abnormal traits mated with healthy ones , the rate of abnormalities rose to 34 percent in the third generation , according to the article			2
the team collected another 238 butterflies last september and determined that the abnormality rate stood at 28 per cent			2
' to blame ' : the researchers collected 121 butterflies in and outside @entity53 two months after the power plant meltdown ( above ) in march last year however , it nearly doubled to 52 per cent among a second generation born to the original butterflies caught			2
it was after breeding them , they noticed various abnormalities that had n't been seen in the previous generation , such as malformed antennae			0
the researchers said the butterflies collected in may were heavily exposed to radiation as larvae			0
the impact was apparently more severe on the second generation , as well as on the butterflies collected in september , because they suffered heavy exposure at a far earlier stage while they were still fertilized eggs or just reproduction cells , according to the team			0
the impact of artificial radiation exposure on the species was also investigated using larvae collected in @entity42 , one of the prefectures least affected by fallout from the nuclear disaster			0
after the larvae were exposed to radiation and fed with leaves contaminated with radioactive materials , similar rates of abnormalities and premature deaths were observed , the article said .			0
