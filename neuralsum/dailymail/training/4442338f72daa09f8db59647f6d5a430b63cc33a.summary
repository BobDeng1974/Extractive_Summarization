@entity0 has admitted he wants to reduce the size of his @entity3 first - team squad			1
currently scouring the market for reinforcements in the january transfer window , the @entity5 boss also intends to remove some dead wood if suitable offers come in			1
@entity11 and @entity12 have seen little game time this season , while @entity15 and @entity16 have been shipped out on loan			1
keen to minimise the numbers of brooding , unhappy players around the dressing room , @entity0 said : ‘ we have a big squad and i want , from a long - term perspective , to have a smaller squad			1
@entity0 is hoping to trim his @entity3 squad during the january transfer window ‘ we have too many players and , in my mind , it ’s much better to have 20 - 22 players of a good level and then fill it with youngsters , instead of having 28 or 29 players			1
‘ you can have experienced players about who are always disappointed			1
but it also costs a lot of money having big squads			2
‘ we have contracts with players but , if opportunities come , and it ’s right for them and right for us , then things can happen			2
‘ i do n’t have in my mind that something has to happen			2
but i think some of the players are looking and we are also thinking about things			2
’ @entity3 fringe players @entity12 and @entity11 could leave @entity5 later this month @entity53 international @entity11 ’s contract is up in the summer and he is likely to leave this month to ensure @entity3 receive a fee			1
‘ right now , @entity11 is not playing and he has ambition , ’ said @entity0 of the midfielder			1
‘ he has to get his fitness up and show performances			2
then we ’ll see what is happening			2
i have spoken with him and we both know the situation			0
’ @entity64 misfit @entity12 , a £ 1.5 million signing from @entity62 , returns from yet another injury this week , but has failed to set the heather alight			1
‘ @entity12 has been out now for two or three months but i think he ’s starting training again on thursday , ’ said @entity0			1
' he has a lot to prove to me			0
he has been out a long time			0
@entity11 ( left ) has made 13 appearances for @entity3 so far this season ‘ when he played at the start of the season , he had a pain in his knee			1
hopefully , now everything is good , we can see the best from him			0
‘ if he shows in training that he is good enough then we ’ll see			0
but , again , we have to put out the team we feel is best			2
it ’s for him to prove himself			0
’ @entity81 striker @entity16 is also surplus to requirements after leaving @entity85 club @entity83 to go on loan at @entity87 in @entity53			1
there is also little prospect of @entity15 being brought back from @entity90 in @entity91			1
‘ something has to happen for them			0
both are out on loan just now , ’ added @entity0			0
‘ if they perform very well , then we have to consider what is happening			0
but there ’s a reason why they have been loaned out			0
’ @entity101 wo n't be joining @entity3 for the final couple of days in @entity103 @entity101 , meanwhile , has abandoned plans to fly to @entity3 ’s @entity103 training camp following a family bereavement			0
talks on the midfielder ’s contract are anticipated this week , but he will play no part in friday afternoon ’s final friendly of the trip against @entity113			0
‘ @entity101 will not be coming because the funeral was yesterday , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ there are only two days left of our trip and i do n’t think it ’s best for him to come out			0
‘ he will train at @entity120 , then he will be ready to rejoin us on thursday			0
‘ against @entity123 , it will be a young team featuring a lot of the players who did n’t play last time			1
