the @entity0 will never be quite the same after sunday night			0
amid the flying challenges , the overload of passions , the bickering and the bad blood one man has kept his head while all those around him have been losing theirs – @entity10			0
but after 750 games for @entity13 it looks almost certain that after what will be his final @entity13 vs @entity16 on sunday the @entity18 winner and brain of the greatest @entity13 in history will confirm he is off at the end of the season to play in @entity24			1
@entity10 has a contract until 2016 but could now play for @entity27 next season instead of the club he grew up supporting as a boy			1
the @entity27 offer includes a coaching role at @entity24 ’s @entity32 with the aim of playing a part in bringing through a bright generation of @entity24 internationals			1
@entity10 is approaching the end of his contract at @entity13 and will consider his future at the end of the season the 34 - year - old midfielder has been offered a coaching role with @entity24 's @entity32 however , newly formed @entity44 side @entity43 have also expressed an interest in signing the player the football world has always speculated over how good @entity10 would be as a coach and these could be his first steps in finding out			1
the director of the @entity52 academy is former @entity54 goalkeeper @entity53 and @entity10 , who has experience in organizing training camps in @entity54 , would work alongside him as well as continuing with his playing career			0
he also has an offer from @entity61 's @entity60 franchise on the table and looks set to announce his decision after the sunday 's game			0
if @entity10 plays a part in sunday ’s showdown it will be his 29th @entity0			2
he has 12 wins , seven draws and nine defeats in that time scoring four goals			2
he pulled the strings in midfield when @entity13 regularly got the better of @entity16 both before and after the arrival of @entity74			0
he played in perhaps the greatest @entity0 for @entity75 when they beat @entity16 6 - 2 at the @entity76 in 2008			0
and he was the epicenter of another devastating @entity13 display two years later when @entity74 lost his first @entity13 v @entity16 5 - 0 at the @entity80			2
it was during the @entity74 era that tensions between the two clubs really came to a head and as the captain and long time friend of @entity16 keeper @entity89 the two came together in reconciliation after a phone call from the goalkeeper to the midfielder that was not well received by @entity74			0
@entity10 celebrates after scoring one of his four career @entity0 goals against at the @entity80 in 2010 @entity10 's @entity13 team - mates swamp the passing maestro after his goal against @entity16 it was a lofted goal over @entity89 's head in a @entity0 in 2004 that was perhaps @entity10 ’s best individual moment from all his meetings with @entity16			1
that game was also his now boss @entity106 ’s last @entity0			0
he was brought on in the second half at the @entity108 with @entity16 leading 1 - 0 and it was @entity10 ’s goal that won it for @entity13 four minutes from time from a move that he had started by playing a pass to @entity115			1
when the @entity116 clipped it over the top of @entity16 ’s defence @entity10 finished past his pal and @entity13 took the spoils			1
regardless of who wins on sunday , football will lose because , with an estimated television audience of 400m @entity10 ’s poise and perfect passing will be seen in the @entity0 for the last time .			2

@entity10 will likely play his final @entity13 vs @entity16 on sunday
he could play for @entity27 and coach at @entity24 ’s @entity32 in 2016
@entity60 have also made an approach to the *35* - year - old midfielder
@entity10 has 12 wins , seven draws and nine defeats in 29 @entity1*35*
his departure from the @entity139 *giants* will be a loss for football
