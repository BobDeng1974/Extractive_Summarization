by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:43 est , 7 november 2013 @entity3 : 08:48 est , 7 november 2013 energy firms have been cleared of rigging gas prices after a year - long investigation			1
electricity and gas watchdog @entity9 and @entity11 regulator the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) said customers had not been ripped off by big firms			1
it means there is no respite for families facing price rises of up to 10 per cent this winter			1
ruling : energy and @entity11 watchdogs found that the wholesale market price for gas was not fixed by energy firms a probe was launched into claims wholesale gas prices were fixed by power firms in september last year			1
it came after a whistleblower claimed the gas market had been ‘ regularly ’ manipulated by some big power companies - prompting concern that this could affect energy prices for households			1
the investigation focused on allegations that gas was sold at a lower - than - market price at around 4.30pm on september 28 last year , to manipulate the benchmark price in @entity40 used by the industry to influence a range of contracts			2
but @entity9 today said the unnamed sellers of the six lowball trades that day have given ‘ credible ’ explanations to ‘ demonstrate that their trading activity was not improper			2
’ ‘ no evidence was found which disputes the explanations provided , ’ it said			0
price hikes : despite gas and electricity wholesale and operating costs remaining almost unchanged since autumn 2012 , the @entity52 companies have pushed through price hikes of up to 10 % @entity9 added : ‘ it has been concluded that no evidence of the alleged market manipulation could be found and therefore that the interests of consumers have not been harmed			1
‘ @entity9 and the @entity7 always take seriously any allegation of market abuse in energy or financial markets and will consider carefully any evidence that is brought to our attention			2
’ the watchdog said its probe was detailed , complex and time - consuming and included information analysis and face - to - face meetings			0
energy secretary @entity74 said @entity9 and the @entity7 conducted a ‘ rigorous review ’			2
he added : ‘ market abuse is a very serious concern and i 'm determined that where it exists , the full force of the law is brought to bear			0
‘ that 's why we 're introducing annual competition reviews to make sure the energy market is operating properly , and we 're proposing to introduce criminal sanctions for manipulation of the energy markets			0
’ the price hikes will add £ 50 to every family 's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £ 100 last month it emerged that profits made by energy firms on household bills have more than doubled in a year while the wholesale price they paid for gas and electricity remained almost unchanged			1
it fuelled suggestions that companies were ramping up prices to boost profits			0
increases in what energy companies pay for gas and electricity added just £ 10 to household bills , but profit margins added £ 50 in a year			1
four of the @entity52 firms have already announced big price rises , with @entity114 bills going up by 9 per cent , @entity110 announced a 10.4 per cent price hike , @entity118 a 9.2 per cent rise and @entity116 an 8.2 per cent increase			0
the firms have variously blamed rising wholesale prices , bills for upgrading gas mains and electricity cables and extra green levies imposed by the government			0
but official figures released by @entity9 showed company profits had doubled in a year .			0

@entity9 and @entity7 say price was not manipulated after year - long *inquiry*
traders who posted low prices for gas had ' credible ' explanations
leaves little respite for families facing rises over up to 10 % this winter
wholesale costs have risen by *1.7* % in a year but profits double
almost £ 100 on every bill is now pure profit , according to the regulator
