we are constantly told how ' booking online ' could save us a tidy amount on our hotels and holidays			0
but a new study has shown that other customers may still be getting a better deal - even when the search criteria is identical			0
and often it pays to be a member of the website you 're buying from			1
there are a number of factors to consider when trying to get the best holiday and hotel deals a study titled ' @entity18 and @entity19 on @entity20 ' by @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , has discovered that online price discrimination exists , and users are often ' price steered ' according to recent bookings and browser history			1
it may not be news to some , and confirm what a lot of us have long believed to be true , but deals being dependent on what ' device ' you 're using to make a booking may surprise you			1
speaking to @entity40 , @entity41 , who co-wrote the report , said : ' we found several instances of personalization on the travel sites			0
' @entity47 and @entity48 both give ' members only ' deals on hotels to users who are logged - in			1
the discounts pop up on 5 per cent of hotels , and amount to $ 12/night off on average			0
@entity56 gives discounts to @entity59 users : 5 per cent of hotels were marked down by $ 15/night on average			2
searching on a mobile in different locations may be a good bet for best prices ' @entity66 and @entity67 steer a small fraction of their users ( less than 10 per cent ) towards cheaper hotel rooms			1
these sites appear to be performing pricing experiments on their users using a technique called a / b testing			0
' users are randomly assigned to groups based on their cookie ; two groups are shown average hotel prices of about $ 187/night , while the third group is shown hotels of about $ 170/night			1
' there is mounting evidence that e-commerce companies are using personalization algorithms to implement price steering and discrimination			2
' the report , that focused on a wide - range of companies , used @entity91 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity48 , @entity92 and @entity56 for its travel analysis			1
the report has found that hotel and holiday prices can vary dependent on what device you are using to search the study found that users are placed into different ' buckets ' dependent on a number of factors , including browser trends			1
cookies that store information about buying trends across the internet can help website tailor a set of results for the user			0
@entity66 uses this method of steering on its hotel searches , although price discrimination was not found when using this website			1
here are a few tips to help you get the best deal possible on hotel and holiday searches ... clear your cookies - websites use trends stored in these to tailor your search to different hotels - and this could be the more expensive ones			2
be patient - adding a selection to your basket does n't mean you have to purchase immediately			0
some retailers will continue to alter prices dependent on popularity and time - span , so it 's often worth taking a risk and holding fire			1
use different devices - some companies will tailor results by what device and platform you are using , so it pays to carry out a few searches using different means			2
location , location , location - if you are always on the move , try conducting a search from different parts of the country , or world			0
this has been found to influence search results			0
however on @entity91 and @entity48 , which are actually one company , the research found that users who were ' logged in ' generally received a better deal than visitors			0
the report continues ; ' first , although members - only prices may be an accepted practice , it still qualiÔ¨Åes as price discrimination			1
' @entity56 extended the results still further as research revealed prices differed depending on what device you were using to book hotels			2
' @entity56 alters hotel search results for users who browse from @entity175 devices , ' it continues			2
' users browsing with @entity177 on @entity175 receives lightly different hotels , and in a much different order than users browsing from @entity181 on @entity182 , @entity177 on @entity183 or other desktop browsers			0
' @entity92 alters hotel search results based on the user 's history of clicks and purchases although there was no evidence of price discrimination			1
this kind of price discrimination is not illegal , demonstrated of when it can prove advantageous for the customer , an example being when you have printed off a money - off voucher for goods			1
there are ways to keep ahead of the game and be in the best position to get the best deals however : search when signed in , then when not , clear the cookies on your browser , and use different devices when conducting a search			0
a spokesperson for @entity66 said : ' presenting different booking paths and options to different consumers through our a / b testing allows us to continually innovate to best serve consumers '			0
