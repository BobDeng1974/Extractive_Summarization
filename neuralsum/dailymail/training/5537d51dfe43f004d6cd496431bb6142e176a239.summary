by @entity0 published : 16:35 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 20:17 est , 22 october 2013 tax breaks for married couples should be more generous and be introduced well before the general election , says @entity4			1
@entity6 ’s chancellor endorses the principle of @entity9 ’s plan for transferable tax allowances worth up to £ 200 a year			1
but he says the tax break should be extended and must come into effect earlier than the start date announced by the government , which is april 2015 – just one month before the election – to avoid the risk of it being rolled back by @entity18			1
lord @entity4 has said marriage tax breaks should be more generous and be introduced earlier than @entity9 has previously announced the prime minister last month announced plans that would allow a husband or wife to transfer £ 1,000 of their tax - free personal allowance to their spouse			1
it would apply if couples are both basic rate taxpayers with one spouse earning less than the allowance			2
gay couples in civil partnerships would also be eligible			1
around four million people are expected to benefit but @entity4 says it should be more generous			1
more than a million married couples will gain only £ 1.35 a week from @entity9 ’s tax break – a third of the amount promised			1
the prime minister said ‘ most ’ couples eligible under the scheme would gain £ 200 a year but a report by economists says many are likely to pick up only £ 70 extra , including most of those with children			2
from april 2015 , married couples and civil partners who are not higher rate taxpayers can transfer £ 1,000 of their tax - free allowance to their spouse or partner			1
however , the @entity56 think tank says the tax break will be undermined by @entity59			2
devised by @entity62 @entity61 , it will come into force in 2017 and replace some benefits paid to working couples			2
unlike current benefits , it will be based on family income after tax			2
as a result , much of the money that couples gain through the tax break will be lost due to reduced @entity59 payments			2
the report says 2.7million working couples will benefit from the new allowance , but 1.1million will get only £ 1.35 after benefits have been reduced			0
around 900,000 of those will have children			0
only 600,000 couples with children will get the full £ 3.85			0
‘ it ’s understandable that it is only introduced at the level which has been proposed at the present time , ’ he said last night			0
‘ but once it ’s up and running that gives us the opportunity to ask for it to be increased subsequently			0
’ he also said that it should be introduced earlier , otherwise it would be easier for @entity18 to reverse the measure if they won the election in 2015			0
‘ i ’m sure it will be in the next @entity97 but the question is over the start date , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ i think it should be up and running during the lifetime of this @entity102			0
it makes it easier to reverse it if it ’s not up and running because you ’re not taking anything away from people that they already have			0
’ some @entity111 have called for the tax break to be extended to all married couples and for the £ 1,000 transferable allowance to be increased			1
lord @entity4 will speak today at the publication of a report entitled ‘ @entity117 – 25 years on , does it meet today ’s needs ? ’ in 1988 he was the first chancellor to give married women an individual tax status			1
he proposed transferable allowances between married couples but his were plans were not implemented			1
the report was sponsored by the @entity126 and concludes that the benefits of independent taxation have been undermined by the failure to include transferable allowances			0
lord @entity4 describes such allowances as ‘ family - friendly ’			1
he says they also a more cost - effective means of reducing the tax burden on low - income households than across - the - board increases in personal allowances			0
in today ’s speech he is expected to criticise @entity139 for delaying the measure because he does not support the plans			0
‘ i think it ’s well known that they have been foot - dragging , for reasons which i think are wholly without merit , ’ he says			0
a @entity147 spokesman said the prime minister ’s plans show that the government ‘ values commitment ’ .			0

lord @entity4 believes tax breaks for married couples should be more generous
former chancellor said plan should come into effect earlier than announced
same *sex* couples in civil partnerships would also be eligible for breaks
