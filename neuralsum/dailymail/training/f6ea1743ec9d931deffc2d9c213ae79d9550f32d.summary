diplomats , intelligence agents and the military missed obvious warning signs that could have enabled them to prevent the deadly attack on the @entity6 diplomatic mission in @entity7 , say senators			1
a bi-partisan report for the first time points the finger at ambassador @entity12 , who was killed in the attack , for refusing offers to reinstate soldiers at the mission in the weeks before the raid			1
it also criticises the military for failing to respond more quickly on the night of the attack on september 11 , 2012			2
' preventable ' : a @entity21 man investigates the inside of the @entity6 @entity23 in @entity7 , @entity21 , two days after the attack that killed four @entity6 , including ambassador @entity12 on the 11th anniversary of the september 11 terror attacks in @entity28 , armed militants stormed the diplomatic outpost in @entity7 , setting the building on fire			2
ambassador @entity12 , computer specialist @entity35 , and @entity36 security contractors @entity32 and @entity37 , both former @entity38 , were killed over the course of two battles that night			0
mr @entity12 died of smoke inhalation after he was taken to a ' safe room ' in the besieged compound			0
confusion in the immediate aftermatch as to the sequence of events leading up to the attack turned the issue into a political hot potato that has continued to dog the @entity53 administration			0
officials first wrongly described the assault as a spontaneous mob protest of an @entity58 , @entity6 - made video			0
such a protest did occur at the @entity60 in @entity61 earlier that day			0
@entity63 critics say the administration was reluctant to deal publicly with a terror attack weeks before the presidential election			0
on that issue , the report dives into the contentious initial talking points issued by the intelligence community , which helped fuel @entity63 allegations of an @entity53 administration cover - up of militant links to the violence			1
' intelligence analysts inaccurately referred to the presence of a protest at the @entity6 mission facility before the attack based on open source information and limited intelligence , but without sufficient intelligence or eyewitness statements to corroborate that assertion , ' the report said			1
an armed man waves his rifle at the mission on the night of the raid : diplomats , intelligence agents and the military missed obvious warning signs that could have enabled them to prevent the deadly attack , say senators carnage : ambassador @entity12 , computer specialist @entity35 , and @entity36 security contractors @entity32 and @entity37 , both former @entity38 , were killed over the course of two battles that night the senators also take the administration to task for failing to bring the attackers to justice more than a year later			1
they say the @entity6 has identified several individuals responsible but ca n't capture them because of limited intelligence capabilities in the region and limited cooperation by local governments			0
@entity113 chairman @entity112 , a @entity114 , said she hoped the report would put to rest conspiracy theories about the attacks			1
@entity63 vice chairman @entity118 said the report showed that despite a deteriorating security situation in @entity7 , the @entity6 government did not do enough to prevent the attacks or to protect the diplomatic facility			1
and @entity63 committee member @entity123 of @entity124 called on the administration to punish those responsible			0
' a broken system overseen by senior leadership contributed to the vulnerability of @entity6 diplomats ... in one of the most dangerous cities in the world , ' she said in the report			1
' and yet the secretary of state has not held anyone responsible for the system 's failings			0
' @entity6 intelligence ultimately blamed the violence on militants who overran the temporary @entity6 mission and , hours later , fired mortars at the nearby @entity36 annex where the @entity6 had taken shelter			0
the report says the subsequent investigation showed individuals from many militant groups took part in the ' opportunistic ' attacks , including @entity152 in the @entity153 , the @entity21 militia group @entity155 , and members of the @entity158 - based @entity157			1
the report does not name @entity160 , who was secretary of state at the time and now is a potential 2016 presidential candidate			1
the @entity163 said the report largely reaffirms the findings reached a year ago by the @entity166 , headed by a former ambassador and former chairman of the @entity169			1
deputy spokesman @entity170 noted that the @entity172 report recommended improvements to security that the @entity163 has already taken , including upgrading security cameras , improving fire equipment and increasing the presence of @entity179 security guards			1
fire : @entity6 intelligence ultimately blamed the violence on militants who overran the temporary @entity6 mission and , hours later , fired mortars at the nearby @entity36 annex where the @entity6 had taken shelter failures : the report also for the first time points the finger at ambassador @entity12 , who was killed in the attack , for refusing offers to reinstate soldiers at the mission in the weeks before the raid the @entity172 report notes that the @entity163 has also created a new assistant secretary position for high - threat posts , but it says the department still needs institutional change to help it react more quickly to security threats			1
it says @entity163 should not rely on local security alone in countries where the host government can not provide adequate protection and should avoid using diplomatic facilities it knows are inadequately protected			0
the report says that the department in 2012 had ignored its own ' tripwires ' set to determine when it had become too dangerous to operate in @entity7 , and continued to operate the facility there despite a growing number of @entity6 intelligence reports showing the danger was rising			1
' the security situation in @entity7 is " trending negatively " and ... this daily pattern of violence would be the new normal for the foreseeable future , ' the head @entity163 officer in @entity7 was quoted as saying weeks before the attack			0
while the nearby @entity36 annex upgraded its security , the temporary mission did not , the report said			1
it said ambassador @entity12 acknowledged the need for more security yet also turned down available @entity6 military resources			0
the report said the @entity232 had provided a @entity233 in @entity234 , made up of 16 special operations personnel			2
but the @entity163 decided not to extend the team 's mission in august 2012 , one month before the attack			0
in the weeks that followed , general @entity243 , then the head of the military 's @entity241 , twice asked mr @entity12 to employ the team , and twice the ambassador declined , the report said			2
ambassador @entity12 had tried to arrange a local @entity21 security force to replace the @entity6 , but the report said the force was never formed because of bureaucratic delays			2
closure : @entity113 chairman @entity112 , a @entity114 , said she hoped the report would put to rest conspiracy theories about the attacks still , the report faults the @entity6 military for failing to anticipate it might be called on			2
it also says there was confusion within the @entity232 as to the location of the @entity36 annex â€” and says the regional @entity6 commander must know where such facilities are in the future			0
@entity267 spokesman @entity266 said the committee report ' largely reaffirms ' earlier findings and that the security recommendations are consistent with steps the @entity163 has already taken			2
' this reinforces what other investigations have found , which is that there was not enough security to protect the four @entity6 who lost their lives , ' said mr @entity266 .			0
