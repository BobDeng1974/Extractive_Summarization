an @entity1 couple say they ended up in a modern - day equivalent of a debtor 's jail after they had failed to pay court fees in connection to a minor traffic violation as their young son lay dying in the hospital			1
@entity13 , a music pastor from @entity14 , @entity1 , was pulled over in @entity15 in december 2010 and issued a ticket for driving with an expired tag on his license plate			1
at the time of the traffic stop , mr @entity13 was returning home from visiting his terminally ill infant son , @entity22 , suffering from a rare brain disease			1
when it rains , it pours : @entity13 , a music pastor from @entity1 was driving home from visiting his dying son , @entity22 ( pictured ) in the hospital when he was pulled over for driving with expired tag on his license plate fined : @entity29 ( right ) also had received fines for a pair of traffic violations around the same time @entity13 's wife of 12 years , @entity33 , also had received tickets for two traffic violations , and both husband and wife were ordered to appear at the @entity38			1
the couple told a judge about their gravely ill child and were both found not guilty , but the judge ruled they still had to pay $ 500 in court fees			1
mr @entity13 , who also has two older children , said at the time of his young son 's illness he could not hold down a steady job because he was spending much of his time at the hospital , according @entity53			2
when the family were unable to come up with the necessary funds to cover the court costs , their case was turned over to the @entity59 , a private company that collects fines for the @entity61 of @entity15			1
a short time later , mr @entity13 said he received a notice from the company threatening him and his wife with jail			2
' they would just plain out say , you know , “ if you ca n’t pay then they ’ll issue you a warrant for your arrest , " ' @entity13 recalled in an interview with @entity53 , which initially broke the story in april			1
the debt collectors made good on their threat in 2012 when the @entity76 stopped making payments and @entity29 missed one of their court dates			2
‘ i felt completely like a criminal , ’ the @entity1 pastor recalled			2
‘ i mean i did n’t sell drugs			0
i did n’t break into anyone ’s home			0
i did n’t kill anybody			0
i had an expired tag			0
’ the couple were sprung from jail a few hours after being taken into custody when a relative paid a portion of their debt			0
verdict : when the couple explained to a judge that their son was dying from a rare brain disease , the @entity94 were found not guilty of the traffic infractions , but they were still ordered to pay $ 500 in court fees hard times : @entity13 he could not hold onto a steady job because he was spending much of his time with his ailing son at the hospital @entity109 's son , @entity22 , passed away june 10 , 2011 , from his brain disease , survived by his older brother and sister			1
the couple have since joined a class action lawsuit filed by the non-profit civil rights organization the @entity115 against the @entity59 and the @entity61 of @entity15			0
the suit alleges that jailing people who can not afford to pay fines is in violations of the @entity120			0
in 1971 , the @entity121 ruled that the @entity122 prohibits imposing ' a jail term solely because the defendant is indigent and can not forthwith pay the fine in full			0
' in the @entity76 ' case , they were found not guilty of committing traffic violations but still ended up behind bars when they were unable to pay the court fees			1
@entity132 , deputy legal director of @entity115 , estimates 1,000 people are sent to jail every month in @entity1 because they can not afford to pay a fine ‘ everyone thinks that debtor ’s prison is over , it ’s behind us , ’ he told @entity53			2
as a matter of practice , and in some cases , policy , the courts ask one question , “ can you pay the fine			0
” if you ca n’t then you have to what ’s called “ sit it out in jail			0
” ’ @entity151 's jail : in 2012 , @entity13 and @entity152 ( pictured here with their two surviving children ) were briefly thrown in jail for falling behind on their payments to a private debt collector that had taken over their case striking back : mr @entity109 , seen here with his daughter , has filed a lawsuit against the @entity59 claiming that jailing people who can not afford to pay fines is in violations of the @entity120 private contractors like @entity59 do not charge the city anything to collect debts , but they pass the cost of doing business onto offenders like the @entity76 , charging them $ 45 a month on top of a start - up fee until the entire debt is paid in full			1
in the first four months after the court ruling , the family managed to pay off $ 300 of the $ 500 they owed in court fees			1
but then things took a turn for the worse			0
after their son passed away in june 2011 , the family lost their home to foreclosure			0
the parents were in deep mourning , and @entity13 said he appealed to the @entity59 to work out a deal with him in light of the circumstance , but his plea fell on deaf ears			2
still in debt : the couple still owe money to the private contractor after paying down $ 1,300 over the next eight months , the family racked up additional $ 2,500 in fines for failure to appear in court , and finally in february 2012 a warrant was issued for their arrest			1
two years later , the family still owe the private contractor money after paying down $ 1,300 .			0

@entity13 , music pastor from @entity1 , and his wife were arrested in 2012 over failure to pay court fees
