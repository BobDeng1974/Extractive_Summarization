@entity0 is secretly testing a new line of location - specific filters in @entity4 and @entity5			2
the firm has been testing the feature on its @entity9 app , using the @entity11 's gps system to pinpoint users and show the filters			1
for instance , @entity0 users who use the service in @entity16 are shown a clear filter with the word ‘ @entity16 ’ written in an artistic font , while those in @entity4 's financial district can unlock filter featuring a shower of dollar bills			1
go to the app ’s settings menu , scroll down to ‘ @entity34 ’ and click ‘ manage ’			0
once there , ensure that you have the ‘ filters ’ setting switched to ‘ on ’ and that you ’ve given the app permission to pull your location			2
users in @entity42 ’s theater district receive a custom filter with the words ‘ @entity46 ’ in yellow lights			2
other users have received customized filters around events such as @entity50			1
the new smart filters do n’t offer any photo - editing effects , and are simply clear filters with a graphic overlay			2
they look similar to they type of stickers that have been popularized by stand - alone photo editing applications			0
the filters appear to be a hit with users of the service - although @entity0 has not yet acknowlegded their existence or officially launched them			1
‘ @entity66 cute snapchat filters based on your location the future is now ’ @ juliacosette , one @entity0 user , tweeted			2
‘ what is this new snap chat filter ? i like it			0
’ tweeted another user , @ debzshin			0
snapchat currently does n’t offer sponsored filters , however the company did recently debut its first customized branded filter at @entity79 advertising festival			1
@entity0 partnered with a publisher to add a corporate logo to snaps taken at a party along with the phrase , ‘ yes we @entity85 ’			0
it ’s easy to see how branded stickers and sponsored filters could become a potential revenue stream for the company , which is n’t currently making money			2
snapchat users are quick to share their new photo filters with friends and @entity95 followers , but remain perplexed by the new feature in february @entity97 bought hugely popular messaging app @entity98 for $ 19 billion ( £ 11.4 billion ) , after failing in a previous $ 3 billion to buy @entity0			1
at the start of april , @entity100 revealed its ‘ @entity106 ’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other			1
this directly followed once - popular social network @entity109 ’s attempts to get back into the game with @entity111 , their own video messaging service			0
@entity97 , meanwhile , is busy trying to increase the profile of its @entity115 app , with rumors that it will shift @entity98 users onto its native messaging client			1
@entity97 announced a selfie feature for messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself			1
@entity125 announced @entity126 , a direct messaging service last december			0
in may , @entity0 released the ability to chat with friends in real time via messenger			0
brands such as @entity133 and @entity134 have sent out hundreds of snaps , and the ability to add their logo to @entity0 content could add extra legitimacy to their efforts			2
last december , the app released its first major update when it added its first line of filters along with a ‘ replay ’ function			1
in may , @entity0 unveiled its own in - app instant messaging and video chat service			0
last week , the company announced it was testing a new group - sharing feature for concerts and live events called @entity153			1
both @entity154 and @entity97 have released similar ephemeral messaging services in attempt to capitalize on @entity0 's runaway success			1
@entity97 released @entity158 , its own service for sending self - destructing messages to friends in mid-june			1
@entity154 also added the ability to send self - destructing audio and video messages via @entity165			1
