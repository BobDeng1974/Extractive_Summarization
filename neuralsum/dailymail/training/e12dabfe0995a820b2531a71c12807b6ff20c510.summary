these pictures taken from footage showing a @entity7 teenager climbing around a crane 1,000ft up in the sky are enough to make your palms sweat even if you have never suffered from vertigo			2
the youth is seen walking along the crane as if it were a tightrope , without showing even a flicker of fear at being so far from the ground			0
the three - minute clip , posted on @entity44 , shows his astonishing courage ( or should that read foolhardiness ? ) as he casually strips off his jumper and puts on a woolly hat for his sky - high work - out the boy , who looks little older than 16 or 17 , then climbs over the side and hangs from just one hand			1
the cars in the street below are so tiny they look like toys as he does monkey bars dangling off the crane			0
and the roofs of the surrounding tower blocks look a long way below the crane where the boy is gambolling about like a carefree toddler in a playground			1
in one heart - stopping moment , he does pull - ups with one hand as he hangs from the crane , before pulling himself up and back on top of it again			1
video : this footage will terrify even those of the strongest disposition the cars below are so tiny they look like children 's toys as the young man does monkey bars in the sky above them using core muscle strength that will impress many a pilates devotee , the youth flips up and over the bars filmed by a friend , the youth is shown dangling from the crane 's dusty bars without even a rope in case he falls eventually , just when the viewer 's nerves can take it no longer , the film stops with the logo dangerous for life			1
it has already been viewed by tens of thousands of armchair adventurers , though most of those who commented on @entity44 realised the danger the youth was putting himself in			2
