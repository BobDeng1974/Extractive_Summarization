but a @entity5 woman was stopped at @entity6 in @entity7 after she tried to smuggle dozens of tadpoles past customs officials ... in her mouth			1
the bizarre encounter began when guards noticed the woman had a bottle of liquid in her hand luggage as she tried to board a plane home			1
a tad too far : the woman was only caught with the tadpoles when she drank the liquid containing them rather than throw it away			1
but guards grew suspicious when she refused to swallow following international flight rules to the letter , the guards told the woman to drink the liquid or throw it away			1
opting for the former , the unnamed woman swilled the liquid in one attempt			1
but when the beady - eyed officials noticed she had not swallowed , they demanded she spit it out into a bucket			2
upon doing so , dozens of tiny frog young rushed from her mouth to the horror of passengers and guards alike			2
when confronted about the bizarre plan , she said she had been given the tadpoles by a friend and did not want to lose them			2
