the head of the @entity18 – the first woman to hold the post – said that anybody attempting to balance motherhood and a career should accept there would be ‘ failures ’			1
she also admitted that despite her position men still talk to her in a patronising way , and that she is forced to ' grit her teeth ' and get on with it			1
@entity3 's comments are surprising as if there is one woman among world leaders who has apparently had it all - and with ease - it would be her			1
as head of the @entity18 the 56 - year - old is in charge of negotiations to save the @entity40 and bailout @entity39			0

' you must accept there will be failures			2
' the only casualty along @entity3 's path to success appears to have been her marriage - she is divorced but is living with her new partner in @entity76			0
she still however plays an active role in the lives of her sons @entity80 , 26 , and @entity81 , 24 , who have not followed her into politics			1
@entity3 first became a mother aged 30 when she was still trying to climb the ladder at @entity51			2
high flier : before heading the @entity48 was minister of finance in @entity49 ( pictured in 2009 ) and rose to become chairman of @entity52 law firm @entity51 , one of the biggest legal companies in @entity55 colleagues told her that she was too young to become a partner in the firm but she persisted anyway			1
she is currently ranked eighth most powerful woman in the world by @entity95 , with @entity97 chancellor @entity96 in first place			1
a former synchronised swimmer , silver - haired @entity3 is still slim and 6ft tall and credits being in good physical health for managing her hectic life			1
in the interview she was asked that , despite her power , were there men who treat her in patronising way			2
@entity3 said : ' oh yeah , of course			0
' i do n't want to embarrass them ( by naming them )			0
' the best defence when that happens is a very good and solid sense of humour			0
