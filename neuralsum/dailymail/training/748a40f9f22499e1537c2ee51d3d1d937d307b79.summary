this is the moment the final passengers were winched to safety off of a burning @entity3 ferry after being trapped for nearly 36 hours adrift in the @entity4			1
around 400 passengers were trapped on the deck of the @entity7 after a fire started on a car deck before tearing through the rest of the ship			1
at least 11 died as emergency workers struggled through wind and rain - lashed seas to mount a daring rescue operation , which largely took place in the dark			1
the dramatic images were revealed today as it was alleged the @entity21 crew were among the first to flee in the ship 's lifeboats , leaving women and children behind			1
the 37 - year - old , who has now returned home in @entity59 , said he and a group of other passengers attempted to connect tow ropes from a tug boat to the ferry when the crew were nowhere to be found			1
he told @entity66 : ' there were no crew members down there - it was just us			0
i could n't work that out			0
from what i understood , some of the crew members bailed out at the beginning			0
' mr @entity51 added that some crew members had ' got off with the first lifeboats '			1
he said : ' there were so many women and children left on the boat			0
why were they not the first in line to get on the lifeboat ? struggle : survivors of the ferry fire huddle together on the deck while the ship continues to burn around them , 36 hours after the blaze started up in smoke : images taken from the front of the ship , on top of the bridge , shows the lower decks consumed by smoke and fire which left at least 11 people dead panic : this image , taken below deck on the @entity7 , shows smoke filling the corridors as passengers struggle to escape the burning ship abandoned : witnesses say they were woken in their cabins by the smoke , and received almost no advice from cabin crew while trying to make their escape ' it was just chaos			1
and i think there should be a few people with their heads a bit low			0
' from what i understood , the ropes on board the ship were not good enough to tow it			0
they ( the crew on the bridge ) were screaming at us ' quicker , quicker '			0
' @entity130 was getting very frustrated with them			0
she was like " why do n't you go down there ? " ' a spokesman for @entity136 told the paper : ' it is too early now to deal with responsibilities about the accident			0
i do n't have any evidence that the crew left before the passengers			1
' the blaze broke out on the car deck on sunday while the ferry was travelling from the @entity3 port of @entity148 to @entity149 in @entity21			1
safe at last : a woman is helped on to a stretcher at the port of @entity154 in @entity21			2
witnesses describe survivors huddling together on the top deck to avoid the heat coming through the floor from the fire saved : a medic wraps a blanket around one of the ferry survivors who stood for hours in freezing wind and driving rain in little clothing after they fled their cabins on dry land : a cargo boat which helped to take some of the shaken passengers to shore unloads them as medics wait to treat them on the quayside the fire caused thick , acrid smoke to fill cabins , waking passengers on the overnight ferry			1
in the chaos that followed , passengers reported receiving virtually no instructions from the crew			2
the principle of women and children first appeared to go out of the window , and passengers started pushing and shoving and came to blows over seats in the lifeboats and helicopter baskets			2
there is still confusion over the numbers of people on board , prompting fears from @entity21 prosecutors that more bodies may be found once the ship is recovered from the @entity4			2
the names of some survivors were not on the manifest and some passengers listed might not have boarded , officials said			0
a total of 427 people were rescued , while @entity136 said there were 475 on board			0
in an inspection just days before the disaster , the ship was found to have failings with fire safety and its plans for how to handle passengers in the event of an emergency			2
lucky ones : tearful relatives embrace after being reunited following the fire which killed at least 11 people mystery : authorities still do n't know exactly how many people were on board the ship , raising the prospect of more bodies being trapped inside the wreckage of the ship			2

images show last of 400 passengers to be airlifted from deck of ferry
