by @entity0 published : 01:59 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 14:55 est , 25 april 2013 the next @entity1 will have its very own version of the vuvuzela - a percussion instrument specifically designed to sound a lot less annoying than its predecessor			1
the caxirola will be a stark contrast to the brightly coloured 3ft long plastic trumpets that blighted the @entity11 football @entity1 three years ago			1
instead of emitting an ear - piercing foghorn screech that led to streams of complaints and forced tv viewers to tune out , organisers say the caxirola will be less grating			1
it makes a rattling sound when shaken and was created in a collaboration between the @entity20 musician @entity36 and the country 's ministry of sports			1
the yellow and green percussion instrument is made from recycled plastic and will be handed to fans attending the @entity44 in june , the country 's unofficial dress rehearsal for the @entity1			2
the president of @entity20 , @entity19 , was quoted in @entity49 saying : ' it is an object that has the ability to do two things : to combine the image with sound and take us to our goals			0
' @entity20 's president @entity19 with the instrument 's creator @entity36 unlike the vuvuzela , which has historical cultural significance in @entity11 , the caxirola has been designed especially for use in stadiums @entity20 's president @entity19 , artist @entity36 and @entity20 's minister of culture @entity63 use the caxirola to play the national anthem a @entity68 spokesman promised the instrument would ' add to the fan experience ' at the tournaments and help ' create a unique @entity20 atmosphere in the stadiums '			1
the deafening sound of the vuvuzela is etched in many a football fan 's mind as the over-riding memory of the @entity79			2
the controversial £ 2 trumpet produced an uncomfortable 127 - decibels , providing a deafening background to the entire tournament			0
louder than a chainsaw , noisier than a lawnmower and even more ear - splitting than a referee ’s whistle – experts said it could damage fans ' hearing in as little as 15 minutes			0
their hum , which drowned out commentary on television coverage and made viewers feel they were in a room full of angry bees , led to the @entity99 cutting out the sound			0
the instrument also injured @entity103 insurance saleswoman @entity102 , 29 , who ripped her windpipe after she blew it during a street party			0
she was unable to speak or eat for two days and was ordered to rest completely to allow it to heal .			0

@entity108 makes rattling sound when shaken , instead of foghorn screech
