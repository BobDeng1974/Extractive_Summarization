parents in the @entity2 should vaccinate their children to prevent the further spread of measles , a leading autism research group has said			1
in a statement , @entity6 said scientific and medical research had repeatedly confirmed that there was no link between vaccinations and autism , despite previous speculation			2
the advice comes during an unfolding measles outbreak in the @entity2 , which has so far infected more than one hundred people across 14 different states in the country			1
parents have been reluctant to vaccinate their children due to rumors of a link between vaccinations and autism @entity28 , the group 's chief science officer , told @entity2 's @entity30 : ' over the last two decades , extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism			1
' the results of this research are clear : vaccines do not cause autism			2
we urge that all children be fully vaccinated			0
' authorities say unvaccinated children are putting the whole population at risk and leading to the reemergence of the disease			0
the outbreak renewed a debate over the so - called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines - fueled by research since proved false that suggested a link to autism - have led a minority of parents to not have their children innoculated			1
dose : a vial of the measles - mumps - rubella virus vaccine , which is being distributed around the @entity2 to prevent further spread of the disease measles vaccines were first introduced in 1963 and the @entity2 @entity65 declared the disease eradicated from the country in 2000			1
but last year , the @entity2 had 644 cases registered in 27 states , according to the @entity65			1
measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes fever , red and sore eyes , runny nose , cough and a rash			0
it can be fatal in some cases			0
it is is one of the most infectious diseases known , and the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) has described it as the ' most deadly of all childhood rash / fever ilnesses '			0
the myth about vaccines and autism began in a now debunked study from 1998 , authored by @entity88 published in the @entity90 medical journal the @entity90 later retracted the publication of the study , conceding that it was ' utterly false '			2
it was later revealed that mr @entity88 stood to gain financially from the study because he was involved in a lawsuit against the makers of the vaccine at the time of its publication , the @entity90 said in an editorial at the time			0
mr @entity88 subsequently lost his medical licence over the issue			0
another study which also claimed to find a link between the @entity104 vaccine and autism was retracted this summer in the @entity2 after concerns over ' possible undeclared competing interests ' of its author			1
the outbreak sweeping across the @entity2 is believed to be linked to @entity111 , where at least 40 people contracted the highly contagious virus last december after coming into contact with someone who had the virus			1
the debate over whether vaccines work has also become a political issue in the race for the @entity121 after potential @entity123 presidential candidate @entity122 made an off - the - cuff rematk supporting ' a measure of choice ' as to whether parents immunise their children			2
that led to @entity129 , possible @entity131 nomination , to post a pro-vaccine comment on @entity133 that read : ' the science is clear : the earth is round , the sky is blue , and # vaccineswork			0
let 's protect all our kids			0
