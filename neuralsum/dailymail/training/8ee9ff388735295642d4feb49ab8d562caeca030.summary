by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 06:52 est , 19 december 2012 this is the moment a traffic warden slapped £ 70 parking tickets on two minibuses carrying disabled children after they raised hundreds of pounds for a homeless charity by singing in a carol concert			1
the youngsters , many in wheelchairs , were being lifted into two specially - adapted ambulances in @entity12 when the enforcement officer wrote out two penalty notices before walking away			1
the twelve children from @entity16 and @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , were returning from the concert on monday afternoon which raised £ 370 when they were hit with the fines			1
caught on camera : the youngsters , many in wheelchairs , were being lifted into two specially - adapted ambulances in @entity12 when the enforcement officer wrote out two penalty notices before walking away disgusted @entity28 shoppers watched the scene as the officer stuck tickets on the windscreens of the two minibuses , which were parked in a city centre loading bay to let the children board witness @entity36 said a group of onlookers tried to reason with the warden and asked him to show leniency , but he refused to back down and told them he had no choice but to issue the tickets			1

when confronted , the warden said “ i 'm just doing my job ”			2
’ office worker @entity50 added : ‘ i took the images from my place of work as i was so disgusted with the action of this person			0

when confronted , the warden said “ i 'm just doing my job ”			2
it was unbelievable ' @entity36 , witness he said : ‘ it 's the irony of it			0
the youngsters had all gone carol singing to raise money for @entity85 - which the city council has cut funding from - and then they ended up with a £ 140 fine			1
‘ these children are also wheelchair users so trying to get them anywhere in the city is difficult so it does take time			2
‘ an able - bodied person could be in and out of a bus in a second but we have to lift the wheelchair in and then make sure it 's clamped , which is what was happening when the ticket was issued and people passing by just could n't believe it was happening			1
unhappy : @entity102 , 17 , is pictured holding the parking tickets with fellow sixth formers and staff at @entity16 and @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , who raised £ 370 for charity at the concert ‘ i know people have a job to do and it is a no - loading zone but these are not boxes being loaded into a van , these are children getting on a bus - and if you were that person i think you would use a bit of judgement			1
’ labour - run @entity118 apologised to the school and has since revoked both fines			1

the youngsters had all gone carol singing to raise money for @entity85 - which the city council has cut funding from - and then they ended up with a £ 140 fine ' @entity65 , @entity129 headteacher a spokesman said : ‘ our civil enforcement officers are expected to , and usually do , exercise discretion and judgement when dealing with situations where there may be a technical breach of regulations but where wider circumstances or sensitivities should be taken into account			1
' if in any doubt , they can call managers to ask for advice about how best to proceed			0
we are sorry this did n't happen on this occasion and for any upset this may have caused			0
’ @entity150 , of the @entity151 , said : ‘ it 's completely out of order and i ca n't understand why anyone would do it			0
it 's ludicrous and shows a complete lack of awareness			0
‘ generally the city is n't bad for accessibility and blue badge holders can apply for access into areas where vehicles would n't normally be allowed			0
but a school like this should have instant access and it shows there needs to be more flexibility			2
