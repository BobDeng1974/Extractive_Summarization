by @entity0 a new breast cancer drug which extends women 's lives by almost six months is now available for patients a new drug for breast cancer which extends women ’s lives by almost six months while reducing toxic side effects including hair loss is now available for patients			1
campaigners claim the drug @entity12 offers a ‘ precious lifeline ’ for women with the most aggressive form of the disease who have tried other treatments			1
it is the first medicine of its kind for breast cancer and is designed to destroy cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissue from unnecessary damage			1
@entity12 , also called @entity12 , combines the original ‘ wonder ’ drug herceptin with a potent chemotherapy agent			2
it is expected up to 1,300 women a year in @entity31 could benefit from the drug , which costs £ 6,000 a month			0
results from a major trial show it prolonged the lives of patients with advanced @entity39 - positive breast cancer by 30.9 months compared with 25.1 months on standard therapy			1
patients had fewer , less severe side effects and reported a better quality of life			0
around 10,000 @entity46 women have @entity39 - positive breast cancer diagnosed each year , about one in five of those affected			2
@entity49 , professor of @entity50 at @entity51 , said : ‘ @entity12 represents a new way of targeting @entity39 - positive breast cancer , which ultimately means that we could extend patients ’ lives compared to existing chemotherapy treatment			1
‘ in addition , we should be able to reduce many of the symptomatic side effects associated with standard chemotherapy			0
’ @entity12 seeks out and kills cancerous cells in a two - stage attack			1
it attaches to the tumour cell and blocks signals that encourage the cancer to grow and spread , then breaches the outer defences and releases a payload of chemotherapy to destroy it from within			2
because its action is so precise , a normally toxic form of chemotherapy can be used but healthy tissue is spared from unnecessary damage			1
the cancer is delayed from returning and side effects from chemotherapy such as diarrhoea and hair loss are significantly reduced			0
made by @entity79 , @entity12 is administered intravenously once every three weeks			2
professor @entity49 , who also works at @entity81 , @entity82 , said at least 1,000 women a year would benefit from the drug after relapsing , but eventually it might be used before the disease spread , possibly replacing current treatment using @entity89 and chemotherapy as separate agents			0
it is expected up to 1,300 women a year in @entity31 could benefit from the drug , which costs £ 6,000 a month ( stock picture ) trials at earlier stages are taking place , he added , and it was possible the technology could be effective in treating other types of tumour			0
@entity103 , of @entity104 , said : ‘ the priority now must be that @entity12 is made widely available across the @entity46 as soon as possible for patients with advanced breast cancer whose lives could be extended from its use			1
’ @entity12 will be available to patients in @entity31 through the @entity112 and requests for the treatment can also be made in other parts of @entity46			0
the @entity116 and the @entity117 will decide whether the @entity118 should fund it in the longer term			0
dr @entity120 , of @entity121 , said : ‘ while we are very pleased that this new treatment will now be made available on the @entity112 throughout @entity31 , it ’s important to point out that this fund is only guaranteed until 2016			0
