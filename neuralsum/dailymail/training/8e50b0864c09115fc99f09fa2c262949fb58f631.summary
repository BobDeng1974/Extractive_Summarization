by @entity0 @entity1 : 22:28 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:01 est , 18 december 2013 it is easy for inmates to get drugs in @entity7 prison but basic needs such as provision of clean underwear are not being met , inspectors have said			1
some wings in the south @entity14 prison are limited to two pairs of underwear per man each week , chief inspector of prisons @entity20 said , recommending that inmates who receive prison - issue clothing should have sufficient sets of underwear each week			1
illegal drug use was ' high ' in the prison and inspectors ' routinely smelt cannabis ' when they visited the jail unannounced in july this year , mr @entity20 said			1
' easy ' : drugs are easier to get a @entity7 prison than clean underwear , an inspector has said @entity33 was re-roled in july 2012 as a category @entity36 resettlement prison for the local area and receives a large population of sex offenders			1
the prison , which opened in 1819 as the @entity7 , was operating at about 60 per cent over its certified normal capacity , the chief inspector said			2
' many prisoners shared small , cramped cells and some had inadequately screened toilets and because , at the time of the inspection , there was far too little activity for the size of the population , many were locked in their cells for more than 20 hours a day , ' he said in his report			0
some 30 per cent of prisoners told inspectors it was ' easy ' or ' very easy ' to get hold of drugs inside @entity7 , twice the level of those who said it was easy to get hold of alcohol			1
but mr @entity20 said @entity7 prison was at ' a turning point ' as new and refurbished activity buildings were being worked on			2
' this inspection came at a very bad time for the prison - when all the disadvantages of major building works were apparent but none of the advantages of the new provision had yet been realised , " he said			0
' cramped ' : the prison was operating at about 60 per cent over capacity , the chief inspector said ( file picture ) ' however , the fact was that the prison was not yet ready for the category @entity36 and @entity83 prisoners it now held and too many lacked the opportunities for purposeful activity and rehabilitation they needed			0
' too much was on hold waiting for the new facilities to be ready and some elements of prisoners ' treatment and conditions were unacceptable - and had remained so for too long			0
' @entity94 , chief executive of the @entity95 , the executive agency of the @entity96 that provides offender services in the community and in custody , said : ' @entity7 was undergoing a significant change when the chief inspector visited , but since then it has continued to adapt to its new role			0
' in january the prison will see further changes with a new range of employment and education initiatives helping to increase productive time out of cell			0

illegal drug use was ' high ' in the south @entity14 prison
@entity7 prison receives a large *proportion* of sex offenders
30 per cent of inmates said it was ' easy ' or ' very easy ' to get hold of drugs
