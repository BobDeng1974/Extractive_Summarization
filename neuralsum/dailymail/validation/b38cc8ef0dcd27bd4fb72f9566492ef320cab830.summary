@entity0 scored in a 2 - 0 win at @entity70 against the @entity67 but still ranks the build up to the game , spent with @entity7 players @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , as one of the worst times of his career			1

@entity0 lifted his knee into the back of then - @entity103 forward @entity106 and was shown the red card that ruled him out of the showpiece at the @entity109 - but he still ranks the final as one of his best footballing moments			2
despite not playing in the final , @entity0 was lucky enough to win the @entity6 four years later having been sent off in the semi-final second leg , @entity0 had to watch on from the stands at the @entity109 ' it was probably the worst 120 minutes i 've sat through , ' @entity0 said of the final			1
' it is horrible because you want to do something , you want to make something happen , but for me , it 's still the best night of my life with @entity4			2
