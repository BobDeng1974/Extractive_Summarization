ever since his death in 1977 , the idea that @entity1 might still be with us has become a favourite with conspiracy theorists			2
but it seems that the @entity1 superfans might get the last laugh , thanks to a @entity11 dentist who believes he can clone the @entity12 using dna sequenced from a tooth			1
and dr @entity15 does n't plan to stop at @entity1			1
dr @entity15 also owns a tooth that once belonged to @entity19 singer @entity18 and claims that a @entity18 clone could be walking the planet as early as 2040			1
resurrection : dr @entity15 bought one of @entity18 's teeth at auction and plans to clone the singer the @entity12 is back : dr @entity15 also hopes to bring @entity1 back to life using dna from his teeth speaking to cosmetic dentistry comparison site , @entity29 , dr @entity15 revealed the same process used to clone @entity31 in 1996 could also be used to bring @entity18 and @entity1 back to life			1
' legally , it is not a problem , ' he added			0
' if something is illegal in one country its a matter of crossing a border			0
' animal cloning still has some glitches they are working out but they are already cloning species			0
once the glitches are worked out humans will follow			0
' there are people in history that everyone is fixated over … @entity50 , @entity12 , @entity51 … it will be possible … and because of this , like the nuclear bomb , it will be happen			0
' dr @entity15 's mission began two years ago when he bought one of @entity18 's teeth for £ 19,500 at auction			1
the tooth had been given to @entity18 's housekeeper , @entity59 in the 1960s , before being passed onto her son who later auctioned the memento			1
' i saw online that it was for sale and bought it , ' explains dr @entity15			1
' i think collecting celebrity dna will be insane in the future as it creates a risk for celebs to have surprise offspring			2
' he now expects to have a cloned @entity18 on his hands by 2040 , the year that would have marked his 100th birthday , but , surprisingly , thinks that @entity18 2.0 might not enjoy quite the same level of musical success as the original			1
' " @entity18 " would be cloned from his dna which creates the body and hardware for the brain , ' reveals the dentist			2
' what goes on in his brain would be largely be down to his environment			0
@entity18 ’s personality and cultural tastes were formed from his upbringing in 40s and 50s @entity92 so this would obviously be different			2
even during his lifetime his musical style changed			0
' he added : ' the musical ability in his dna is undoubted so we would aim to create an environment for the child where this ability would be nurtured and allowed to develop			0
' pioneering : @entity101 's @entity31 became the world 's first cloned mammal when she was born in 1996 despite being sanguine about the ethical minefield that would need to be navigated before bringing the pair of singing superstars back to life , dr @entity15 does admit to qualms about how the cloned @entity1 and @entity18 would cope with the media attention that would inevitably ensue			1
' it could be a little unfair , ' he says , before adding : ' whilst some elements of the cloning process would be publicised , it is likely the identity of the child would not initially be disclosed publicly			0
' until , of course , a spectacular talent for music and a taste for the limelight began to appear ...			0
