' all i know is we just do n’t want them running around half - naked on our streets			1
that ’s the bottom line , ' said mayor @entity5 standards - and pants - have been slipping in the @entity9 city of @entity10 , where the mayor has decided things have gotten as low as they can go			1
mayor @entity5 is the author of an ordinance that will soon see anyone wearing their pants ' more than three inches below the top of the hips ' fined for public indecency			1
@entity10 is just the latest place in the @entity20 to take issue with where young men position their trousers			2
so why all the palaver over pants ? ' all i know is we just do n’t want them running around half - naked on our streets , ' @entity5 told the @entity53			1
' that ’s the bottom line			2
' the @entity55 of @entity56 unanimously approved the ordinance , which will require anyone guilty letting their pants hang ' more than three inches below the top of the hips ( crest of the ilium ) ' to pay a fine of $ 25 for the first offense , and $ 50 for each offense thereafter			1
unanimous : the ordinance was approved by all relevant @entity10 officials and states that anyone wearing their pants too low will incur a fine , says mayor @entity5 ' @entity72 and the @entity55 , we wanted an ordinance passed in black and white that our officers know what to tolerate and what not to tolerate , ' @entity5 told the @entity53			1
' now they know what we expect , and they know how to handle it			0
' @entity10 's ordinance purports to be for the health of its citizens			2
it states that ' there is evidence that indicates that wearing sagging pants is injurious to the health of the wearer as it causes improper gait			0
' the trend for wearing the pants very low on the hips may have originated in the @entity20 prison system , where inmates are not allowed to wear belts			2
' unconstitutional ' : civil liberties groups argue that banning people from wearing their pants low on their hips is a violation of their rights the look was adopted by hip hop culture and by the 1990s , young men around the country were wearing their pants perilously low with underpants - clad buttocks on prominent display			1

‘ you are walking by your mother , your grandmother , your underwear is showing			0
