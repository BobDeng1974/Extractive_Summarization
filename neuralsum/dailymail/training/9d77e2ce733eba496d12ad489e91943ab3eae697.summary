@entity76 , a physiotherapist at @entity106 's @entity108 clinic offers advice for managing joint and muscle pain while commuting : movement is medicine : try to increase the amount of physical activity you do whether its during your commute , or by incorporating it into your day – this could include cycling to work once week or walking around the block at lunchtimes ; drive comfortably : drivers need to make sure they sit in a comfortable position that 's right for them - adjust your seat , back support and steering wheel to avoid leaning too far back or having to stretch to reach the wheel or pedals			1
you should also avoid placing pressure behind your knees ; avoid prolonged sitting : whether it 's on your commute or in the workplace , try a mixture of standing and sitting : hop off earlier : one of the easiest ways to make a significant difference when commuting is to get off one or two stops earlier to increase your physical activity ; simple exercises : help keep your joints mobile and prevent stiffness by doing some simple exercises and stretches such as gently rotating your ankles , lifting your knees , extending your legs and rolling your shoulders .			0
