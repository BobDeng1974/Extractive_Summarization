by @entity1 reporter published : 11:04 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 11:43 est , 3 august 2013 the mother of a two - year - old boy has been left shaken after a @entity5 customer knocked a pink headband off the head of her son and called him a f * * * * t. @entity10 claims that her son was verbally and physically abused after she stopped off at the @entity12 store with her two children on thursday night			1
her oldest child @entity15 , who loves to dress up - from superhero costumes to sparkly outfits - was wearing his mother 's lace flower headband which he had been playing with earlier in the day			1
playtime : after playing dressing up at home , @entity15 was still wearing a pink headband belonging to his mother when they went to @entity5 ms @entity10 was at the check out when a large man with a beard , and wearing tattered shorts and a camouflage shirt , yelled out : ' that 's a boy ? ' , according to the @entity31			1
he then grabbed the headband and threw it to the bottom of the shopping cart before cuffing @entity15 lightly around the side of his head and saying with a laugh : ' you 'll thank me later , little man ! ' in her shock and anger that a stranger had touched her child , ms @entity10 told the man : ' if you touch my son again , i will cut your damn hands off			1
' the 31 - year - old claimed the man then looked at her child in disgust and said : ' your son is a f * * * * * * f * * * * t. he 'll get shot for it one day			1
' after the man left , the mother - of - two said no staff or customers came to her assistance as she started to shake while comforting @entity15			2
before the incident , her son had been confidently waving at customers from the seat in his trolley , ' charming all the old ladies by waving like a little pageant prince '			2
family : @entity10 and @entity69 , with their son @entity15 and baby son protective : @entity10 was left shaken after a man called her two - year - old son a f * * * * t in her blog , a @entity78 , mrs @entity10 said two older women had even come up to tell her how adorable her son was			2
she said that while the ' cuff ' the man gave her son was light , she objected to a stranger touching her child , and trying to impose his views on @entity15 and making assumptions			1
ms @entity10 added that at two - years - old her son does not have a sexuality			0
he was just a boy who had been playing			2
she added : ' even if being gay is a lifestyle choice ( which i do n't believe for a second ) , it is not a choice that a toddler can ever make			0
and much like little girls can play baseball or enjoy monster trucks , little boys can and do play dress up with mommy 's clothes ... everything is new and exciting to a kid , and they learn by trying new things			0
' future fears : the couple say the incident has made them nervous about the world their children are living in since writing about the incident on her blog , the mother - of - two has been inundated with comments - some supportive , others criticizing her parenting skills			0
despite many people suggesting that she makes an official complaint , and advising her to check if the incident was caught on the store 's surveillance cameras , ms @entity10 has decided not to pursue the matter			0
she said the experience has made her reflect on the world in which her children are growing up , adding : ' while we may accept and support whoever our kids turn out to be , i am scared beyond words at what it would mean for them if they are gay			0
why should anyone have to live in fear because they fall in love with someone that you or someone else does n't agree with			0

@entity143 gave child a *gentle* cuff and said he would thank him one day
customer in @entity12 yelled boy would be ' shot for it one day '
family do not plan to press charges but *remain* shocked at *confrontation*
