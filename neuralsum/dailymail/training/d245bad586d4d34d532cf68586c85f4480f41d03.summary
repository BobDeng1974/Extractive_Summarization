we all know that it sometimes suits football 's coaches and players to speak with forked tongue			2
if you are exceptional at reading what 's said , but dyslexic about what 's between the lines , then you 're in trouble			2
however it may well be that when @entity13 pin - pointed @entity15 's impending matches with @entity16 and @entity17 as the most difficult he expected to face this season there was no subterfuge			1
@entity15 manager @entity13 poses with his medal after his @entity22 win in july a few days ago i was speaking to the club coach of one of @entity15 's @entity22 - winning players and he admitted that the footballer had come to him not long before our chat to confess that he was mentally and physically shattered - that suddenly he ached all over			1
die @entity15 is already missing central parts of their vorsprung machine - @entity31 retired , new captain @entity32 and @entity33 injured			1
thus if others are going through the post-world cup blues and blisters then @entity34 has an interesting job of work on his hands			0
his prognosis is : ‘ for me , it is perfectly clear : the months leading up to the end of the year will be incredibly hard			0
‘ we have players who are tired , affected physically and who have n't recovered emotionally after the @entity22			1
‘ first of all , we have to take a step back , solidify ourselves and try to find the players who are in the best physical condition and are not battling against injuries			0
the last time @entity15 won the @entity22 , under @entity56 in 1990 their @entity54 results included a 1 - 1 draw with @entity58 and a remarkably narrow 3 - 2 win over @entity60			1
more recently , @entity61 lost 4 - 0 to @entity58 and 4 - 1 to @entity62 in friendlies and squeaked past @entity64 3 - 2 in the months post @entity65 in 2014			2
@entity56 is n't automatically a natural ally of @entity13 's			1
famously idiosyncratic in some of his declarations and decisions [ recently banned by @entity70 for failing to comply with their ethics investigator ] @entity56 can , now , spark as much derision as respect for some of his football views			0
@entity77 and @entity15 legend @entity31 has retired from international duty @entity32 is yet to play this season due to injury @entity33 is also currently sidelined with injury problems he 's taken several pot - shots at @entity83 's @entity77 for example			1
@entity86 , in fact , @entity56 admitted he thought winning the tournament was beyond @entity88 's @entity15 and that a semi-final appearance , plus positive publicity for the @entity91 , would be an acceptable product from a tournament in which @entity95 football normally regards domination as a birthright			1
yet his choice of phrases nicely reflects the predominant zeitgeist in @entity15			1
purring with pride at being the world 's number one again , and content with the velvet football which @entity13 's team can lay on at will			1
but still looking for a bit more of that iron fist			0
not just the @entity13 way			1
according to @entity56 : ‘ in aesthetic terms @entity15 has never played so well			1
@entity13 has done a wonderful job and has transformed @entity95 football culture so that we now play a much more seductively			1
we have exceptional attacking power - never better			2
‘ however the important thing always is to retain our combative mentality			0
players must be prepared to sacrifice themselves			0
they should be ready to put up with a bit of pain			0
' it 's absolutely wonderful to have such technically gifted players but i worry that some of our them are too fragile physically			2
‘ a few fall over at the slightest contact and they ´ re immediately looking for the referee			0
’ @entity56 and @entity13 are the only two living men to have lifted football 's greatest prize as @entity95 coach			1
obviously , in terms of playing pedigree , trophies and even managerial pedigree they are ill - matched			2
the all - time thoroughbred and the whole - grain brown bread			2
@entity138 celebrates as @entity15 boss after winning the @entity22 in 1990 and the @entity95 legend remains an influential figure presiding over football in the country although @entity13 has the air of the maverick his squad atmosphere is high - tech , calm , modern			1
the fact that @entity15 now face @entity16 is , for some of us , a throwback to the 1974 @entity22 when the @entity16 ' greatest ever side , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 , were narrowly beaten ( 14 minutes from time , @entity158 ) in the quarter - final			1
compared to the rigid discipline and immense strategic planning of @entity88 's victorious era , @entity56 recalls his first @entity22 win as a harum - scarum , riotous affair			1
he admits : ‘ we got up to all sorts in my day but nobody found out			0
there was no social media back then			0
i remember we trained for the that @entity22 in @entity170 , ( @entity171 ) and we were bored rigid			2
i used my status as captain to persuade the local police to escort me into the town without anyone finding out			0
" i could n't possibly tell you what i got up to of course ... @entity180 and his assistant @entity181 could take advantage of @entity15 's potential fragility with @entity17 there was a dispute about our bonus payment system and , as captain i warned the federation that we players were prepared to stop training and even refuse to go to the @entity22 if they did n't meet our demands			1
" we managed to find a compromise position in the end but things were very tense between us and @entity195 , the coach			0
‘ we certainly did n't start the competition in the best situation but we were all in warrior mode , particularly against @entity199 , so we ended up winning			2
i remember my pep talk to my team mates before the final			0
i said : “ just one more big push and we 'll make history and our country proud ”			0
‘ even as i said it though , i knew that nobody was listening			0
they were all thinking about the game			0
’ however , just to continue the theme there was a post @entity22 dip 40 years ago too			2
missing several stars from the final , injured or retired , @entity15 's handful of matches post winning in @entity218 against @entity219 's @entity199 included draws with @entity220 and @entity221 , defeat to @entity223 and a narrow 1 - 0 win over @entity225			1
embarrassing for the @entity95 , schadenfreude for everyone else			0
so , the message is clear			0
for @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and co. - beware the ides of october .			0

@entity15 boss @entity13 pin - pointed @entity15 's *qualifiers* against @entity16 and @entity17 as the most difficult he expected to face this season
@entity31 has retired from international duty , while @entity33 and @entity32 are sidelined with injury
@entity13 believes his squad have n't recovered emotionally from @entity22 win
@entity180 's @entity17 side could *capitalise* on their fragile state
