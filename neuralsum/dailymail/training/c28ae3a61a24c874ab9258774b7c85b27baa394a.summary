a 1981 @entity2 memo which planned for @entity4 ’s death referred to ‘ packing his body in ice ’ and ‘ restraining ’ the @entity8 if necessary by the use of @entity11 troops			1

he was sent to @entity44 in 1947 after being sentenced to life at the @entity47 war crimes trials			0
in 1981 , @entity11 officials believed a clash between @entity11 and @entity8 troops was possible in the then divided city because they no longer supported a @entity52 plan to cremate @entity4 and return his ashes to his family			1
foreign secretary @entity54 was convinced – despite opposition from the @entity38 – that @entity4 ’s body should be returned to his family for ‘ moral and legal reasons ’			1
the document detailed what @entity11 officials believed might happen if @entity4 died during a month when the prison was run by the @entity8			1
it stated : ‘ in a @entity61 month , the @entity8 could prevent the body being moved , using their guard troops if need be			2

it states : ‘ if the @entity8 seek to prevent the move ... minimum force will be used to restrain them			0
‘ the possibility of @entity61 harassment of the aircraft in the [ air ] corridors can not be ruled out			0
apart from normal confidentiality in flight planning , it may desirable to adopt diversionary tactics to make it difficult for the @entity8 to identify which aircraft is carrying the body			0
’ the possibility seems to have alarmed some @entity2 officials			0
one wrote : ‘ i doubt whether the action envisaged is realistic			0
’ but another unidentified official wrote : ‘ i can only say that a lot of thought went into the paragraphs in question			0
they look frightening on paper , but i am confident that the @entity11 military can handle the @entity8			2
