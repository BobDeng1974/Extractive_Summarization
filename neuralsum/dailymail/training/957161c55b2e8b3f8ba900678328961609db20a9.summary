@entity5 beat odds of one - in - 438 million when he picked up a £ 160,873 euromillions prize this year to add to the £ 1 million sum he won in the @entity9 in september 2011			1
but the @entity11 property developer , who lives in @entity12 , @entity13 , joked that his windfall could have been even bigger			1
adrenaline junky @entity5 said the thrill of his second win did not compare to his real passion , skydiving			1
he said : ' i was n't really that bothered			1
' it is a hobby many fathers may not encourage their 13 - year - old daughter to do , but not so for mr @entity5 , who was once a member of the @entity11 skydiving team			2
' the first win enabled me to make a few changes in my life , most importantly sending my daughter @entity38 to private school and maintaining her skydiving training sessions , ' he said			2
mr @entity5 , who never picks his own numbers and always plays the lucky dip , was so laid back about his second big money win that he did n't even claim it until two months after the prize draw in november			1
he added that he could be sitting on even more money , saying he had a few more tickets he had not yet checked			2
mr @entity5 , ' happily divorced ' in his own words , lives alone but was accompanied to a photo shoot to celebrate his win by a mysterious young brunette who kept hold of his 11 - month - old pug puppy , called muffin			2
he moved to @entity12 in 1995 and does not plan to move away from the area			0
making history : @entity5 ( pictured with a cardboard cutout of himself ) was given another big cheque after winning euromillions a second time ' i did n't know anyone at that time and i did n't have much money and the only place i could afford a home was @entity12 , ' he said			0
' the place , the area , it is very safe , i have lovely neighbours			0
' for clean - living mr @entity5 , some of the trappings of a millionaire 's lifestyle will take some getting used to			0
thinking back to his first win , he said because he is teetotal he had difficulty mastering the typical technique of celebrating by spraying a bottle of champagne			0
' i do n't drink and i do n't smoke so i had to waste a whole box of champagne until i got it right , ' he said			0
this year , he did jet off to @entity82 , @entity83 , for a few weeks to ponder his fortune and said he wanted to renovate his own three bedroom ' normal ' home this time			1
' i 've always worked very hard and never spent more than i have so money has never been a major problem for me , ' he said			0
mr @entity5 bought his winning ticket at a @entity91 store in @entity92 and could maybe one day make it a hat - trick of wins as he said he planned to carry on playing .			0

@entity97 , *41* , won the @entity18 twice in just three years
in 2011 he won a fortune of £ *1million* and a later won a further £ 160,873
