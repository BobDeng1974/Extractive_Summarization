a husband who committed suicide with his wife in a ' @entity4 ' pact had sent a text message revealing they planned to kill themselves to a mental health worker the night before			1
but the message sent by @entity10 , 44 , on november 7 last year was not read until the following day and mental health officials have been questioned over the delay			1
an inquest heard he was found dead alongside his wife @entity15 , 27 , in their bedroom on november 8 , with the couple having left a note signed ' @entity4 '			1
' suicide pact ' : @entity15 , 27 , and @entity21 , 44 , left a suicide note signed ' @entity4 ' a copy of the play , with a passage highlighted , was also found next to their bodies and a @entity28 had been playing on the television			1
the evening before , mr @entity10 sent mental health worker @entity30 a text message , which read : ' @entity15 and i have chosen to end our lives			1
' we have suffered for too long and can not bear it any longer			0
our backdoor and gate are unlocked			0
' the inquest into mrs @entity41 's death heard that mr @entity30 did not see the message or that he missed calls from mr @entity10 until around 9am the following morning , when he was scheduled to see him			1
concerned at the message , mr @entity30 said he first tried to call mr @entity10 but it diverted to voicemail , then sent him a text message but again failed to get a reply			1
police were eventually alerted and found the couple , who married in 2005 and had been in regular contact with mental health professionals , dead in their two - bedroom home in @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56			1
detective sergeant @entity57 said in a statement that a note found read : ' unless you are the emergency services , do not enter			2
@entity15 and @entity62 , aka @entity4			2
' tragedy : the couple were found dead in the bedroom of their home in @entity55 in november last year a post-mortem examination on mrs @entity41 - who was her husband 's full - time carer - found she died from an overdose of prescription drugs			2
at a separate inquest into mr @entity10 's death last week , a suicide verdict was recorded			1
today , mrs @entity41 's mother , @entity78 , questioned why the text message revealing the suicidal intentions of the couple was not acted upon sooner			1
she asked mr @entity30 : ' if @entity62 had sent you 34 texts before this one and none had given any indication of wanting to take their own lives , why did n't you call 999 ? ' mr @entity30 said mr @entity10 left the message on his work mobile phone the evening before their deaths after he had finished for the day and he read it the following morning			1
he added that a full investigation had been launched and that part of it would centre on whether a new policy needs to be drafted relating to mobile phone use			2
mrs @entity78 said her ' headstrong ' daughter left the family home aged 18 and met mr @entity10 through her and his wife at the time			1
' @entity15 and i spent a lot of time at loggerheads with each other , ' said mrs @entity78 , from @entity107 , @entity108			2
missed : mr @entity10 had sent a text revealing the couple 's intentions to a mental health work ' both of us are strong - minded and we clashed , and @entity62 would take her under his wing because @entity15 and i were n't getting on particularly well			1
' eventually , mr @entity10 and his wife split and he formed a relationship with mrs @entity41 , who was 17 years his junior , an arrangement mrs @entity78 said she ' did n't entirely ' approve of			1
she added : ' she was an adult and there was nothing i could do			0
' contact between mother and daughter diminished as mrs @entity78 said ' a lot of animosity ' existed between them			0
' there were several olive branches and several reconciliations but after a short period it would go back to her being quite mean towards me , ' mrs @entity78 went on			0
mr @entity30 said @entity30 and mrs @entity41 came to see him in april last year seeking help after a ' significant development ' in their lives which was not expanded upon at the inquest			2
the issue meant that they had to give a police statement , he said			0
' both were distressed about those matters			0
' dr @entity145 told the inquest that mrs @entity41 had taken an overdose and cut her wrist in a previous suicide bid			2
inquest : the hearing at @entity152 heard that mrs @entity41 had killed herself when she saw her on may 31 , mrs @entity41 was having trouble sleeping , suffering from anxiety and experiencing psychotic episodes			0
' all the symptoms were related to something that had happened very recently , ' she said			0
' it was a kind of trigger			0
she had panic attacks and she was n't in control			0
' with anti-depressants , her condition started to improve and the ' risk factors ' disappeared slowly , with her thoughts turning positively to her future , including having children and contacting her father again			0
' i did n't think she was going to commit suicide , ' the doctor went on			0
recording a verdict that mrs @entity41 took her own life , @entity56 coroner @entity173 said : ' i have to be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that a person intended to take their own life			0
' i wanted to be sure that @entity15 had not been coerced into this			2
' it appears to me that she was able to make up her own mind at the time of her death , and although mr @entity10 was some 17 years her senior this was something that she would have undertaken of her accord			1
