@entity1 's autobiography has seemed to be an endless stream of sad score - settling			1
but while the former @entity7 batsman ’s claims of a bullying culture are certainly worthy of investigation , it ’s @entity1 ’s mass of contradictions that leap off the page			1
here ’s the best ( or worst ) of them … @entity7 's @entity15 ( left ) reacts with team - mates @entity1 ( centre ) and @entity18 after he takes a wicket against @entity20 during a test at @entity22 in 2011 skating on thing ice after the removal of @entity25 and @entity1 ’s demotion from the captaincy , @entity7 travelled to the @entity28 in early 2009			1
@entity1 relates that he ‘ gave it my best ’ upon being back in the ranks			2
‘ i had come to the @entity33 and gone out of my way to make things as smooth as possible for @entity37 , ’ he insists			0
yet within a week of arriving , he was agitating to be allowed home between the third and fourth tests			2
the reason : his wife @entity41 had chosen to appear in the @entity43 television programme rather than joining other families on tour			0
@entity46 and @entity47 understandably declined his request			2
pietersen in talks with @entity7 coach @entity25 during his first stint in charge in 2008 @entity1 with his wife @entity53 on the red carpet at the pride of @entity57 awards on sunday night who bullies a bully ? one of @entity1 ’s central claims is that a culture of bullying existed in the @entity7 dressing room , particularly among the clique of @entity65 , @entity15 , @entity66 and @entity18			1
yet in his book @entity1 is relentless in his contemptuous attitude towards @entity65 , assassinating his character and constantly ridiculing him with references to his moniker of ‘ cheese ’ or ‘ @entity73 ’ , having a go at everything from his on - field attitude to his cycling obsession			1
the scale of abuse he directs at prior appears to be of a persecuting nature itself			0
how about @entity1 sitting with his mouthpiece @entity83 at @entity84 ’s this summer while the broadcaster tweeted about @entity86 : ‘ we ’re watching you captain weasel			2
’ is that not bullying ? what about @entity1 ’s criticism of batsman @entity93 on his debut at @entity95 ? he did this both to @entity47 and his team - mates			1
he also criticised @entity98 , a supposed friend , in @entity99 as @entity7 plunged to a 5 - 0 defeat			1
he asked @entity101 , in front of the team : ‘ is there not anybody better than this bloke in county cricket ? ’ @entity1 and @entity65 celebrate winning the @entity108 down under in january 2011 @entity1 ( right ) in the stands at @entity84 's earlier this year with his friend @entity83 ( centre ) petals flowered the other main target of vitriol is coach @entity47 , for whom @entity1 makes no secret of his contempt			1
he also outlines how he was in two minds about his one - day career and wanted to give it up to achieve a better work - life balance and make his career more manageable			0
yet in 2011 , at the height of all this discussion , he sent an over-friendly email to flower opening with the line ‘ @entity130 ? ’ — the nickname @entity47 used to have in @entity128 , one only really used by southern @entity129			2
in the nauseating email he declared an ambition to be one - day captain but only if @entity47 stayed on as coach so that they could work together — in contrast to his claim in the book that the pair had not get on ‘ ever since 2009 ’			1
@entity1 also calls @entity47 ’s coaching into question			1
he writes : ‘ i know you are a dreadful coach not by how you won but by how you lost			0
your methods created an environment where people became terrified of failing			0
’ yet the facts do not support the idea that @entity47 was a bad coach , however poor that last tour of @entity149			2
he took @entity7 to no 1 in the world in three forms of the game , winning three @entity108 series , one of them away , and achieved an away series win in @entity20 , admittedly with @entity1 playing his part			1
@entity1 with former @entity7 coach @entity47 in the nets at @entity158 in december last year you ’d @entity18 off , too this week , at one of his public appearances , @entity1 attacked @entity18 for quitting the disastrous @entity108 tour last winter ( but did not do so in his book )			1
according to the batsman ‘ a lot of the players felt aggrieved by him jumping ship in the middle of the series			0
he let the team down			0
if it was his elbow , fine , but he could have held on for another couple of weeks ’			0
yet the document about @entity1 ’s behaviour compiled by the @entity175 , which was leaked this week , suggests that he told a member of the medical staff that if the third test was lost he would use his knee condition as an excuse to go home			1
@entity1 denies this , although in 2011 he left the @entity183 with a hernia problem that tour staff felt was manageable			2
soon after returning to @entity186 he was spotted in a nightclub			0
@entity1 and @entity18 celebrate at the end of the fourth test against @entity149 in @entity158 in december 2010 tempted by @entity191 riches @entity1 has repeatedly said that he did not wish to prioritise the lucrative @entity191 at the expense of his @entity7 career , while espousing the @entity191 ’s virtues in his cricket development			1
he has always said that @entity7 was his main concern			2
yet he asked to fly to @entity20 to play in the @entity191 semi-finals right in the middle of back - to - back tests against the @entity28 at @entity22 and @entity200 in 2012			0
dressing room tales in a press conference at the start of the @entity108 tour last summer , @entity1 declared that the @entity7 camp was a place full of harmony , a united place			1
‘ we ’re all having so much fun			0
i think we ’ll stay friends after cricket , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve all grown up and the environment now is absolutely fantastic — i ’m not lying , i ’m being dead straight			0
’ yet in the book he says quite the opposite : ‘ the dressing room had been awful for years			0
there were wins and star players , but the dressing room was sick all along			0
’ first - class puzzle @entity1 still maintains that it is his wish to play international cricket again and that he hopes certain changes of personnel at the top might help him			1
‘ if i was offered the opportunity to play test cricket again for @entity7 i would jump at the chance			2
i dream of playing for @entity7 again , ’ he says in the book			1
yet this summer , when he was contracted to @entity234 , he failed to play a single day ’s first - class cricket for the county , apparently disappointing his old mentor @entity237			0
it was a strange way to push the case that he fervently wanted to play test cricket again			0
@entity1 always claimed that @entity7 were his main concern rather than the riches of the @entity191 @entity1 celebrates with captain @entity86 during their ashes win over @entity149 last summer but their relationship turned sour after @entity1 was sacked from the @entity7 team last winter tweet and sour @entity1 made much of how the spoof @entity248 account @ @entity250 upset him and how it led to him breaking down in tears in front of @entity47 , of all people			1
yet @entity1 received requests to stop @entity83 tweeting abuse about players , in particular @entity86 , to @entity83 ’s huge audience			2
when these approaches were made he told his colleagues that they needed a thicker skin			0
memory failure in his book @entity1 insists that he can not remember the wording of the texts he sent about @entity46 in the episode known as ‘ @entity266 ’			1
he says he sent them to a friend in the @entity270 team and they were just part of ongoing banter with an old mate			0
yet he details conversations that were had with others stretching back several years , including quotes in conversations			0
@entity1 shares a joke with former @entity7 captain @entity46 during the @entity20 series in 2011 a negative image at the end of his autobiography @entity1 asks : ‘ am i bitter ? ’ and answers : ‘ no , and no again ’ , insisting ( correctly ) that he has much to be proud of			1
yet his account of his latter years with @entity7 focuses heavily on spats with fellow players and is full of justification for his arguments , giving it an almost joyless tone despite it covering a period when @entity7 — and he himself — enjoyed plenty of success			2
sadly , he dwells on the negative aspects of what happened towards the end of his international career and almost skims over many of his fine achievements			0
@entity1 's autobiography has rocked the world of cricket with various revelations			1

@entity1 's autobiography has been an endless stream of score - settling since its release in the past week
his book has mass contradictions throughout that leap off the pages
former @entity7 man targets *ex-team* - mates and coaches with @entity65 and @entity47 among those on the receiving end
