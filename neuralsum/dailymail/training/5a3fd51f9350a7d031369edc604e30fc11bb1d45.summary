from one of the world ’s greatest fighters who is on a missionary visit to the @entity5 to a very local lad bearing a grudge in @entity8 , this is the first hectic weekend of boxing ’s new winter season			2
@entity10 will try to put a potential billion dollar fight with @entity12 out of his mind so as to concentrate on beating @entity15 challenger @entity14 in @entity16			1
defeat for the @entity10 in a catch - weight defence of his world welterweight title against a little - known light - welter champion would be a disaster commercially as well as for his legacy			1
@entity10 ( left ) prepares for bout with @entity14 of the @entity15 in @entity16 this weekend @entity10 poses during a workout session ahead of his welterweight bout this weekend @entity10 must put a potential billion dollar bout against @entity12 out of his mind @entity27 , @entity16 @entity10 by 5th round ko of @entity14 @entity29 on points over @entity31 @entity32 on points over @entity34 @entity35 , @entity8 @entity36 on points over @entity38 @entity39 by 10th round ko of @entity41 @entity42 on points over @entity44 @entity45 by 3rd round ko of @entity47 @entity48 by 6th round ko of @entity50 @entity51 by 5th round ko of @entity53 with talks reportedly on - going with @entity12 for the mega event the world has been waiting so long to see , this is a fight @entity10 can not afford to lose			1
not with his promoter @entity58 striving to open up the huge @entity60 boxing market to its first pay - per - view fight			0
not that he is likely to be beaten			0
@entity58 will be anxious that @entity60 ’s own boxing idol , three - time world amateur champion and double olympic gold medallist @entity29 , wins as well			0
@entity29 ’s success is the key to persuading the @entity68 government to permit subscription television for his fights			0
@entity60 's @entity29 , a three - time world amateur champion and double gold medallist , will also be fighting expect him to prevail , also			0
amusingly , against a @entity73 flyweight who looks so much like @entity10 that they call him @entity75			1
another , even greater , ex-amateur finds himself on this bill in the remarkable position of defending a world title in only his third professional fight			1
@entity83 ’s @entity82 takes on a @entity73 who , with 52 wins from his 53 fights , comes from the opposite end of the boxing spectrum			0
earlier this saturday night , on @entity89 , @entity38 angrily seeks home - town revenge for his previous defeat by former light - heavyweight world champion @entity36			1
the hostile build - up , brilliantly stage - managed by promoter @entity93 , has elevated a fight between two men who were each knocked out in recent world title fights into a pay - per - view @entity97 on @entity100 television			2
some selling job , this			0
@entity36 and @entity38 during the weigh in on friday in @entity8 the opposition duo come face to face as they build up to their clash on saturday night however , this is a competitive match - up in its own right			1
it is also a good mix of styles between @entity113 the slugger from the streets and @entity36 the stylist with a university degree in mathematics			2
@entity38 ’s hunger for redemption should make him more dangerous this time around and @entity36 will need to have recovered his appetite for boxing if he is to repeat his victory and be the one moving on towards a world cruiser - weight title bid			1
@entity48 may be given a sharp work - out by @entity50 in his latest come - back fight from that devastating @entity127 by @entity128			2
the rest of the starry cast - list on @entity93 ’s packed promotion – including @entity39 and @entity42 in @entity133 title defences - should improve their records with victories ranging from comfortable to one - sided .			0

@entity10 set to face @entity15 challenger @entity14 in @entity16
potential of billion dollar fight with @entity12 in back of his mind
defeat against @entity14 in world welterweight clash would be a disaster
