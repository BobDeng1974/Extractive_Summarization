@entity21 ( left ) and son @entity1 flew their first commercial flight together with @entity13 @entity6 served as captain and @entity1 as first officer on the flight , which was made even more special by the fact that it coincided with @entity6 ’s 56th birthday			1
thanks to his father ’s job @entity1 was given access to places that most children can only dream of , and it led him on a path towards becoming a pilot			2
he said : ‘ @entity36 really is my inspiration when it comes to flying			0
aviation was all i knew from a young age			0
‘ the house was full of books that were either flying related or an aviation manual of some kind			0
i started logging flying hours towards my pilot ’s license from the age of 14 and i was flying before i could drive			0
’ @entity21 ( right ) served as captain while his son , @entity1 , was his first officer on the flight he added : ‘ i was very fortunate to have seen so much of the world and industry growing up , going away on trips with dad and back then , before the " locked flight deck door " policy , i was sat in the flight deck watching it all first hand			1
' i ’ve tried other jobs in different industries but nothing compares to flying			0
’ @entity1 wears a pilot 's uniform as a boy the father - son flight occurred nearly 25 years to the day that @entity1 was born			1

the pair 's first commercial flight together , from @entity18 to @entity19 , coincided with @entity6 's 56th birthday @entity6 said : ‘ what a unique and wonderful way to celebrate my 56th birthday			1
this flight will be a little strange for me in that i am still quite new to this type of aircraft , although i have over 21,000 flying hours			0
‘ @entity1 will be the more experienced pilot on the @entity95			2
i will be expecting some constructive criticism			0
