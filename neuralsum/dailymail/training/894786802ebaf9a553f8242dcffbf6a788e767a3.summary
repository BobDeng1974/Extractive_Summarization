@entity0 acted like it was just another day as he appeared on television from the anchor 's chair of the @entity5 - without mentioning the mounting firestorm over his professional blunders			1
@entity0 , @entity5 's leading name in news , introduced segments on conflict in the @entity12 , as well as extreme weather , even as his earlier reporting on the same topics was pored over by his own network - and rivals			1
the longstanding anchor made a humiliating apology after admitting a story he told about being on a helicopter hit by an rpg in @entity23 was untrue			1
@entity0 is also at risk from rivals who want his job , according to the @entity48			2
former @entity5 presenter , and current @entity51 personality @entity49 , has allegedly been dropping hints that she would like to take his place - if the dent dent in his credibility proves insurmountable			2
@entity0 confessed that he ' made a mistake recalling ' a flight he took on a @entity59 helicopter over @entity23 in 2003			1
' made a mistake recalling ' : @entity0 , shown left in @entity23 and right in the aftermath of @entity35 , has found his claims met with scrutiny he has previously said the aircraft he was on was hit by a rocket - propelled grenade that miraculously did n't explode , and managed to land with no loss of life			1
in the most extreme version of the tale , told to @entity70 in march 2013 , he said : ' two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire , including the one i was in , @entity77 and @entity78			0
' in fact , he was on a different aircraft entirely , which by some accounts was as much as an hour behind the one helicopter which was actually hit			0
he recanted his account after being called out by veterans who really were on the chopper			0
@entity5 has launched an official probe into @entity0 , lead by @entity87 , its top investigative journalist			2
since the apology , questions were also raised about statements @entity0 made on coverage of @entity35 , which was one of his proudest moments at @entity5			1
he claimed to see a body floating down the street in the @entity96 of @entity38 , past the @entity97 where he was staying			0
sore spot : @entity0 's friday broadcast opened with an exclusive story from @entity23 - the country from which @entity0 's much - maligned error stemmed in a 2006 interview he referenced the moment : ' when you look out of your hotel room window in the @entity96 and watch a man float by face down , when you see bodies that you last saw in @entity111 , @entity112 , and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country '			1
some are sceptical of the story , as the @entity96 was not extensively flooded in the disaster , bringing into question whether there would have been enough water for a body to float down the street			0
he has also claimed that flood water gave him dysentery , which medics have said was not prevalent during @entity35			0
nonetheless , @entity0 's top two items tonight were on the very subjects under most scrutiny			0
he led the broadcast with a story from the struggle with @entity131 in @entity23 , then moved on to the impact of extreme weather in @entity134 , included flooding in @entity136			0
as well as the internal probe , the @entity48 also reported that ' a secret task - force ' from the rival @entity140 network is also dredging up old footage of @entity0 in the hope of finding more claims which do not withstand scrutiny			1
according to the newspaper , @entity145 , the president of @entity146 , ordered the task - force himself - but the network has strongly denied such a group exists			0
the @entity5 also outlined another threat allegedly closing in on @entity0 - his former @entity5 colleague @entity49 , now a big - name anchor at @entity152			1
a source told the paper : ' @entity49 still has deep , deep contacts at @entity5			2
she would love to return as the @entity5 anchor ... she wants to be back in the big leagues again			2
' others denied she had designs on the @entity5 top spot .			0

@entity0 admitted he was n't really in a helicopter hit by an rpg in @entity23 *war*
also accused of inventing a dead body he ' saw ' during @entity35
