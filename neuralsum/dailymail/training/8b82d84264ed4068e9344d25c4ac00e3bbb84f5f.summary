perilously perched over the edge of a raised pavement , bursting through a fence and even left on top of a concrete bollard - these photographs show the hilarious , and often dangerous , parking feats attempted by some of @entity9 's worst drivers			1
photographs posted on social media channels are providing a catalogue of parking disasters on the country ’s roads , as bemused @entity17 and @entity18 users shame those who struggle behind the steering wheel			1
the pictures , which have been taken across the country , include a black @entity22 parked on a double , yellow line and on the corner of a t - junction			1
one picture even shows a car parked in a grass ditch , while another is of a @entity22 4x4 straddling a raised concrete curb in a busy @entity59 car park			2
another image shows two cars , a @entity62 and a @entity63 , which are parked side - by - side but are so close together , they are almost touching			1
the positioning of the cars would make it impossible for the driver to get back in the @entity63 , let alone drive off without smashing their wing mirrors			0
there are also plenty of drivers who have ignored the spacious white lines and parked across two spaces			2
impact : the driver of this car has reversed into this hatchback , and pushed the other vehicle into a fence blocked : the drivers who have parked properly in these disabled spaces will be in for a surprise when they return to find this @entity85 blocking their route out cross country : the driver of this hatchback has left the road behind , leaving the car on the edge of patch of grass , having reversed onto a pathway too much space : the @entity98 's compact sizes usually makes life easier for drivers trying to fit into a tight spot - but this motorist needed two spaces to park another shot to be posted is of a black @entity63 parked precariously on top of a concrete bollard			1
according to the @entity108 , many drivers find it increasingly difficult to park as cars have got steadily larger , while parking spaces have remained the same			0
' statistics show that as car size increases in line with safety and fashion ( 10 - 17 per cent larger than their automotive predecessors ) many drivers are struggling to master the art of parking them , ' said a spokesman			0
' indeed , 72 per cent of car - owning households in @entity9 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 have reported parking - related door damage – at a cost of as much as £ 300 per door			0
' meanwhile , the minimum measurements of a car space have remained static since 1994			0
' hanging out : this driver ( left ) clearly struggled with the concept of parallel parking , while this driver may not have noticed the curb when they left their car outside this @entity142 supermarket ( right ) hazard : other motorists would struggle to get around this car safely after the driver abandoned it on a kerb poking fun : this man could not resist poking fun at a @entity154 driver 's poor parking skills			0
