deputy head : @entity1 , 46 , was found dead a day after police questioned him over allegations he had purchased child pornography from abroad a paedophile deputy headmaster who secretly filmed his pupils was left free to continue his abuse for more than two years after police failed to act on information that he could be a danger to children			1
@entity1 , who had worked at the £ 10,000 - a - year private school for more than 20 years , was named to @entity14 authorities as a suspect in july 2012			1
he was among 2,345 individuals suspected of having accessed child pornography whose names were handed to the @entity14 ’s @entity19 ( @entity19 ) following a major inquiry in @entity21			1
but the @entity19 failed to act on the information from @entity24 ’s @entity23 – and it was only in november last year that @entity26 police were told that @entity1 had been buying videos of naked boys from a vendor based in @entity21			1
even then , @entity25 did nothing about the 46 - year - old until three weeks ago – almost a year after being informed			2
nor did officers warn @entity33 in @entity34 , where @entity1 , an it expert , regularly took children away on school trips			1
the blunders were compounded when officers failed in a bid to get a search warrant from a magistrate			0
so they simply visited the paedophile ’s home , just over a mile from the school , and politely asked if they could examine his computer			1
he refused and the officers left without arresting him			0
workplace : mr @entity1 was employed at £ 10,600 - a - year @entity33 in @entity49 in @entity26 ' well - regarded teacher ' : the school headmaster said governors and staff felt ' shocked , angry and betrayed ' within hours , however , he tried to destroy the evidence by reportedly setting fire to his computer and other devices and paperwork – and then hanged himself in the garage of his £ 360,000 four - bedroom home			1
detectives were still able to recover 75 images taken on a camera that was hidden in a bag in the school ’s male changing rooms			1
there were 465 images from a local swimming pool and 38 from two other unknown locations			1
detectives said the victims are boys aged from nine to 12 and the images were taken from 2000 onwards			0
four boys aged between nine and 12 have been identified as featuring in the images , and their parents informed			0
but in many other cases , faces are not shown , or are out of focus , making it impossible to know the full tally of his victims			0
detectives who searched mr @entity1 's home after he died discovered hundreds of images they believe came from a camera hidden inside a sports bag home : mr @entity1 was single and lived alone in this £ 360,000 detached house in @entity90 , @entity26 the case has sparked fresh fears about potentially thousands more paedophiles being left unchecked , despite evidence against them , because @entity14 police are taking so long to act on masses of information from child sex investigations overseas			1
another name on the list of 2,345 suspects given to @entity14 authorities by @entity24 was cancer specialist @entity103 , 41			1
last month @entity103 pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual assault and 12 counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child , with many of the offences taking place at @entity112 in @entity113			0
shocked : school headmaster @entity114 said everyone at the school felt ' surprised , angry and betrayed ' he was known to the authorities in 2012 – 16 months before he was arrested for abusing ill children – but investigations were ‘ shelved ’ until november 2013			2
he is expected to be jailed when he returns to court for sentencing			0
last night shocked parents at the school where @entity1 taught were struggling to cope with the revelation			1
a source close to the school told the @entity127 it was feared that as many as 25 pupils had been covertly caught on film			0
he had also masterminded his school ’s computer system , issuing @entity132 to all pupils			0
his digital mastery has led to fears of what else he could have done , and concealed			0
yesterday @entity138 confirmed an adjourned inquest had been told that @entity1 died by hanging			2
there were calls for a thorough investigation into the delays in the investigation			0
local mp @entity145 said : ‘ questions do need to be asked of @entity25 around how quickly this was dealt with			0
’ @entity148 , the police and crime commissioner for @entity26 , said : ‘ i expect the independent watchdog to investigate thoroughly and rigorously			1
my initial judgement is that it is likely that something has gone badly wrong here			0
’ police informed @entity157 ’s headmaster , @entity114 , that his deputy had killed himself after he had been questioned about buying films of young boys			0
initially mr @entity114 planned a remembrance ceremony and paid a glowing tribute , telling a local newspaper : ‘ it ’s a cutting edge school and he was a cutting edge guy			1
he was an ideal deputy and i could n’t have asked for better			0
’ yesterday , however , mr @entity114 said in a statement : ‘ everyone at @entity33 feels surprised , angry and betrayed			1
’ yesterday an @entity26 police spokesman said there was no evidence of physical abuse by @entity1 of any children			1
there had been insufficient evidence to arrest @entity1 , he added			2
yesterday , a resident in the @entity177 where @entity1 lived said : ‘ i ’ve heard he hanged himself in the garage and was burning papers in his office before then			1
’ @entity1 ’s parents @entity181 , 77 , and @entity183 , 72 , live nearby			2
they were not available for comment			0
@entity25 only yesterday reported itself to the @entity186 for its long delay in investigating @entity1 – weeks after his death			2
last night an @entity190 spokesman said : ‘ it is very concerning there appear to have been considerable delays in these cases before the police have taken action			0

@entity21 detectives said they sent police ‘ hundreds of names ’ of people who viewed ‘ horrific ’ child abuse videos distributed from @entity223 by a crime ring			2
globally , as of last november , 348 arrests had been made and 386 children rescued			0
