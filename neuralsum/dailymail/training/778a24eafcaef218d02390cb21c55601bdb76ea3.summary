a @entity1 expat has been reunited with his leather wallet and passport – nearly two decades after they were lost during a train ride across @entity6			1
it appears no one stole anything during the 18 years that @entity11 ’s wallet was missing as it still contains the passport and his long - expired credit cards , driving licence , receipts and an identification card from an old job			1
but where it was all this time and how it was discovered remain a mystery that may never be solved			0
@entity21 : @entity11 has been reunited with a wallet that he lost 18 years ago in @entity6 if this wallet could talk : the wallet was discovered in a shopping mall in the mountain town of @entity27 @entity11 still is n’t certain how he lost the wallet while travelling by train from @entity30 to @entity31 in 1996			1
he fell asleep on the train and did n’t realise it was missing until he was getting into a car in @entity31			2
he reported it missing to police and then went through the hassle of getting a new passport and cancelling and ordering new credit cards			2
years passed and @entity11 , who now lives in the @entity40 state of @entity41 , forgot about the incident until he received a surprise email from a police officer in the tiny @entity6 mountain town of @entity27			1
it turns out someone found the wallet on the floor of a shopping centre in @entity27 – more than four hours by train from @entity31 and 90 minutes from @entity30 – and handed it in to local police			1
@entity27 police snapped this photo of mr @entity11 's wallet after it was handed over to them in october after a quick search online an officer found his @entity60 profile and tracked down his email address			1
@entity11 , 50 , told @entity62 : ‘ there was a little bit of shock and surprise when i received the email			2
it was an “ @entity70 ” kind of thing			0
‘ i ’m not sure what i ’m going to do with it			0
the fact that everything was intact and it was found in a supermarket , that ’s weird			0
’ the wallet still contains @entity11 's old passport , credit cards , receipts and a work identification card @entity11 said the wallet itself – a gift from his wife – is in good condition and showing few signs of additional wear and tear			2
‘ i ’m amazed at its good condition and that it had all my old @entity92 – my passport , driving licence , old company @entity92 and all my credit cards			0
i ’m not sure if at the time there was money inside or not , but i think not			0
‘ my wife even remembered the wallet as she gave it to me			0
’ police say they have no idea how the wallet found its way from the train to the town of @entity27 ( pictured ) @entity11 , a married father of two who runs his own media business , said the police have n’t figured out how the wallet ended up in @entity27			1
a police spokesman told @entity6 's @entity114 news agency : ‘ we have no idea how it found its way from the train to a shopping centre			1
