a sky - diving pensioner who refused to get out of the plane was left hanging precariously from her instructor as a tandem dive went dangerously wrong			1
the 80 - year - old desperately tried to cling onto the door after apparently deciding she no longer wanted to do the jump			2
as her harness came loose the woman , named @entity9 , was left dangling from her instructor as she hurtled towards the ground at 125mph			1
the tandem diver grasps her tightly as they plummet towards the ground at 125mph tumble : with the woman dangling from the skydiver they plummet towards the ground in @entity14 in the dramatic video , the woman 's tandem diver can be seen clinging onto her safety harness which had slipped down her legs during the jump in @entity14			1
as they plummet towards the ground , the woman 's top flies up exposing her back to the high - speed winds			2
the cameraman - a separate jumper filming the whole experience - comes over to help as the pair get into difficulties			0
just before the jump happened , the woman appears to yell ' no ! ' - telling her instructor to stop her getting out of the aircraft			0
it was her first skydive , which she had been planning for a decade , she says on the video which was published on @entity46			0
@entity47 , technical officer at the @entity48 , said the pensioner could easily have slipped out of the harness			1
high spirits : @entity9 , 80 , the tandem skydiver , said it was her first ever jump as she is filmed before take - off			1
she said she had been planning the leap for a decade smiling : @entity9 looks at the camera as the plane makes it ascent in preparation for the jump ' she was very close to slipping out , ' he said			1
' you can see from the video the instructor was trying to get to the harness and cling on to it			2
the person with the video camera was also trying to help			0
' it looks that she is a pretty frail and light woman which would have helped			0
' ' at the start of the clip she is reluctant to jump and they were in a bad position with her holding onto the door frame as they left the plane			2
' things like this have happened in the @entity80 before and there have been two fatalities			1
struggle : after making the ascent , the woman apparently decided she did not want to make the jump which she had been planning for the last decade jump : with the woman appearing to resist , she plunges out of the plane			0
a @entity91 parachute expert said the problems started because they were in the wrong position when they left the aircraft ' there has never been a similar incident in @entity91 , and safety checks here are a lot more rigorous			0
' he added that the light - aircraft would have been travelling at around 70mph as the divers exited the aircraft			0
he said that in @entity91 , if a skydiver wants to pull out at the last minute the plane should return them to the ground and they should not be made to leap out			1
at the end of the video the woman can be seen on the ground apparently uninjured but is seen being given some careful attention			0
even the instructor is traumatised and has to be consoled by a colleague			0
parachute jump : the woman , 80 , and her tandem diver leap from the plane over @entity14			2
shortly after leaving the aircraft , they would have been travelling at 125mph descent : the separate parachute jumper videoing the jump captures the moment they tumble out of the aircraft descent : they plummet towards the ground - but problems quickly start as the woman 's harness slips difficulties : the instructor clings onto the woman 's harness as they get into trouble freezing : the woman 's back is completely exposed to the elements and rushing wind as her jacket top flies up during the fall difficulties : the tandem skydivers hold on to each other as they fall towards the sun - scorched @entity14 earth topple : rather than being strapped together , the two jumpers ' legs are both pointing in different directions comforting : the instructor , left , and the woman jumper , 80 , right , are helped after they made a successful and safe - landing in @entity14 video : the woman leaps two minutes into the footage			1

@entity9 , 80 , can be seen shouting ' no ! ' as she leaps out of the plane
