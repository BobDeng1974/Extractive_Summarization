president @entity0 threw off the gloves and took a direct punch at one of his possible successors , likely @entity6 presidential candidate @entity5 , in an interview airing this morning			1
responding to @entity5 's claims that he 'd ' absolutely ' cancel or ' disown ' a deal with @entity11 on ' day one ' if elected to higher office , @entity0 told @entity15 host @entity14 that such an approach ' would be foolish			1
' ' and , you know , perhaps mr. @entity5 , after he 's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy , will feel the same way , ' the president added			2
@entity5 fired back at @entity0 on @entity21 , saying , ' @entity22 would be better served by a president who spent more time working with governors & @entity26 rather than attacking them			1
the current administration has been more willing to weigh in , however , when a presumed @entity6 candidate threatens to dismantle one of the president 's prized domestic or foreign policies , which , in the case of @entity5 , was the nuclear arrangement with @entity11			1
' i am confident that any president who gets elected will be knowledgeable enough about foreign policy and knowledgeable enough about the traditions and precedents of presidential power that they wo n't start calling to question the capacity of the executive branch of the @entity22 to enter into agreements with other countries , ' @entity0 told @entity61 during their monday afternoon chat following the @entity15 host 's invocation of @entity5 's past comments			1
' if that starts being questioned , that 's going to be a problem for our friends and that 's going to embolden our enemies			0
' continuing , @entity0 said , that ' would be a foolish approach to take ' and slammed @entity5			2
a cadre of probable @entity6 presidential contenders have spoken out against the @entity0 administration 's laboriously negotiated pact with @entity11 to stunt the growth of the country 's program			1
@entity5 is the only one to say he would not honor his predecessor 's deal with @entity11 and the international community if elevated to presidency , however			1
' if i ultimately choose to run , and if i ’m honored to be elected by the people of this country , i will pull back on that on january 20 , 2017 , because the last thing — not just for the region but for this world — we need is a nuclear - armed @entity11 , ' he told radio host @entity93 last week			2
' it leaves not only problems for @entity97 , because they want to annihilate @entity97 , it leaves the problems in the sense that the @entity101 , the @entity102 and others are gon na want to have access to their own nuclear weapons			0
' @entity0 has said on repeat that he believes a diplomatic agreement with @entity11 that shuts down , in theory , its pathways to developing a bomb will be more effective than a military option			2
@entity0 was responding to @entity5 's claims that he 'd ' absolutely ' cancel or ' disown ' a deal with @entity11 on ' day one ' if elected to higher office			1
@entity5 is currently the governor of @entity40 swatting @entity5 away : @entity0 takes part in the @entity35 @entity120 on the @entity121 , which included a spot of tennis ' we 're now in a position where @entity11 has agreed to unprecedented inspections and verifications of its program , providing assurances that it is peaceful in nature , ' he told @entity15 , touting the accord that representatives of his administration and five other countries reached with @entity11			1
furthermore , the global community will have assurances that @entity11 's stockpile of enriched uranious ' remains in a place where they can not create a nuclear weapon , ' he said			0
' this deal is the right thing to do for the @entity22 , for our allies in the region and for world peace			0
' @entity0 said ' it 's a hard argument to make that we 're better off right now ' having ' no insight ' into @entity11 's facilities ' and letting them rush towards a bomb			2
' and if @entity11 does n't change its behavior , @entity0 said the @entity22 will ' still have the options available to me - or available to a future president that i have available to me right now			1
' included in that portfolio will be the ability to reinstate financial sanctions on the country at any time nuclear experts at the @entity163 determine its broken the rules			0
other areas of the plan remain fuzzy and will await clarification in a final round of talks , scheduled to take place by the end of june			0
already a fissure between the @entity22 ' and @entity11 on sanctions - the @entity22 will only commit to gradual relief that can be ' snapped back ' into place while @entity11 is taking the stance that restrictions should be removed immediately and permanently in exchange for nuclear concessions - has emerged since the countries announced the preliminary agreement last thursday			1
@entity0 told @entity15 his administration still is n't sure it ' can button down ' all the issues standing in the way of a long - term agreement and it will have to ' work very hard in order to complete a deal			1
' and while he characterized @entity97 prime minister @entity189 's demand that a final deal force @entity11 to recognize his country 's right to exist as a ' fundamental misjudgment ' of the political waters , @entity0 noted that one of the most ' profound ' differences between @entity22 and @entity11 ' is the vile , anti-semitic statements that have often come out of the highest levels of the @entity11 regime			1
' ' so what i would say to the @entity97 people is you are right to be suspicious of @entity11			0
there 's no reason why you should let your guard down with respect to @entity11 , ' he said			0
' but ultimately , @entity11 is deterrable , and it is deterrable not just because of @entity97 's superior military and intelligence capabilities but also because you got a really strong ally in the @entity22			2
' shifting to the topic of @entity214 briefly , @entity0 confirmed that he was considering removing the @entity216 country from the @entity22 ' list of countries that sponsor terrorism			1
' understand that the criteria is very straightforward			0
is this particular country considered a state sponsor of terrorism , not , do we agree with them on everything , not whether they engage in repressive or authoritarian activities in their own country , ' he said			0
' and so those standards , those criteria are the ones that are going to be measured against the current activities of the @entity214 government			0
' @entity0 said he 'll make a decision after he receives the @entity236 's recommendation			0
the president said his most pressing concern was whether he could effect the @entity22 ' relationship with the communist country in a way that ' benefits the @entity214 people over the long term			2
' ' there are areas where there are serious differences ' between the two countries , he said			0
' but i do see the possibility -- a great hunger within @entity214 -- to begin a change , a process that ultimately , i think , can lead to more freedom and more opportunity			0

the president took a jab at the @entity40 governor during an interview with @entity15 host @entity14
@entity0 was responding to @entity5 's claims that he 'd ' absolutely ' cancel or ' disown ' a deal with @entity11 on ' day one ' if elected to higher office
jab at @entity5 departed from the @entity35 's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president
@entity5 fired back on @entity21 : ' @entity22 would be better served by a president who spent more time working with governors & @entity26 rather than attacking them '
@entity0 defended the *informal* agreement his administration made with @entity11 and the shift toward @entity214 , which it may take of its list of terrorist countries
