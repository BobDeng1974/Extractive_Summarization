by @entity0 published : 17:09 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 19:57 est , 26 july 2012 kitted out : @entity2 swimmer @entity1 models the new swimsuit , which could give her an advantage over rivals who have n't got one @entity12 ’s swimmers will wear kit that could give them as much as a 2 per cent advantage over many of their rivals in the pursuit of gold at the @entity20			1
@entity23 swimming great @entity21 – who helped to test the swimsuits – said he believed they could make a difference			1
‘ it might sound like a minimal advantage , but it could be significant , ’ said the five - times @entity28 champion , who described yesterday how he battled winds of 128km in a wind tunnel at a special testing centre in @entity32 in the @entity33			1
it remains the personal choice of @entity12 stars such as @entity39 if they want to wear the swimsuits made by team sponsors adidas , or other brands with which they have endorsement contracts			1
but adidas say up to 70 per cent of @entity12 ’s swimmers will be wearing them and experts from the company ’s 80 - strong innovations department believe they could be the difference between gold and silver			2
the swimsuits will also be worn by the @entity52 , the @entity53 and some of the @entity23			2
@entity54 , a spokesman for the adidas innovations department , said : ‘ we believe we have created a suit that will give all the swimmers who wear it a big advantage			2
‘ we tested it against all our rivals and it absorbs 32 per cent less water than all the other manufacturers ’ [ kit ]			1
‘ it is also incredibly light			2
in 2008 in @entity70 , the suit [ @entity52 swimmer ] @entity67 wore to win two gold medals was 208g			2
the suit she will wear here in @entity74 is under 100g			0
‘ in all we believe it could see a 2 per cent improvement in performance			0
we can not be certain because it has never been tested in the @entity20			1
‘ but in testing our swimmers were very impressed			0
because of the positioning of the seams , because of the material we use , because of what we call the hydrophobic finish and the way the compression aspects of the suit support the muscles , it gives the swimmers a better position in the water			0
‘ when @entity67 tested the suit she could feel the difference			0
as i said , it could be of huge benefit to the swimmers			0
’ @entity99 , swimming ’s world governing body , banned an earlier type of special bodysuit after it contributed to the fall of several world records at the 2009 world championship in @entity108			0
and even though the new adidas suit complies with @entity99 regulations , there is clearly an advantage to be gained with the technology being used			0
only yesterday @entity115 swimmer @entity114 , a three - time @entity28 champion and the man looking to end the dominance of his countryman @entity118 at the @entity20 , expressed his disappointment that some swimmers could have an edge because of nothing more than their brand of swimsuit			1
personal choice : @entity39 in training , clad in her high - tech swimsuit mixed feelings : @entity23 swimmer @entity21 , left , helped test the swimsuits			0
but @entity115 swimmer @entity114 , right , expressed disappointment that some swimmers would have an edge just because of their swimsuits ‘ if it was up to me , we would all go back to swimming in banana hammocks , ’ said @entity114 with a smile , before informing his audience that he was using a ‘ technical term ’ for the old - style briefs that are better known as @entity142			1
‘ that way the best swimmer would simply emerge			0
’ @entity12 ’s athletes in other sports could also gain an advantage because of advanced clothing technology			1
at the @entity151 @entity150 wore an adidas bodysuit that experts believe could have shaved as much as 30 seconds off his time in the final time - trial , allowing him to cement his historic win earlier this week			0
the same suit will be available to @entity158 and his @entity12 cycling team - mates as they compete in the @entity20 .			1

but is it right athletes should have an edge because of their brand of kit ?
