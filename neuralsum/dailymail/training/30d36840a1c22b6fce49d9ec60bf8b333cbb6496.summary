whales ' sing ' for their supper as they mount joint operations to track down food , according to new research			2
scientists know that humpback whales have a trick or two when it comes to finding a snack at the bottom of the ocean			2
but up until now , how they find their meal at night , with little or no light , had been a mystery			0
' humpback whales are known to cooperate with others to corral prey near the surface , ' said professor @entity31 at @entity32			0
' recent studies suggest they may cooperate [ with each other ] , when feeding on bottom prey , as well			0
' silent hunters : the investigation revealed that whales make ' tick - tock ' noises while hunting together at night in deep , pitch - black water , but are silent when hunting alone tasty : the whales in this study mainly fed on sand lance ( pictured )			1
sand lances are most commonly found by fishermen in the @entity47 and @entity48 , but are found in oceans throughout the world humpback are usually found near coastlines and feed on shrimp - like krill , plankton , and small fish			2
the mammoth creatures are known for their unique songs , which can travel for huge distances			0
their moans , howls and cries can continue for hours on end and scientists are still attempting to decipher their meaning			0
scientists believe humpbacks sing to communicate with others as well as attract potential mates			0
humpbacks migrate each year from their summer feeding grounds near the poles to warmer breeding waters near the @entity75			0
whales off the coast of @entity78 were tagged with special underwater recording devices so professor @entity31 could determine how specific sounds correlated with seafloor feeding			1
the investigation revealed that whales make ' tick - tock ' noises while hunting together at night in deep , pitch - black water , but are silent when hunting alone			1
the reason for this change in tactics remains unknown , however			0
researchers found that they were mostly looking for sand lance - eel - like fish known to bury themselves in the sand of the ocean floor			1
professor @entity31 suggests that whales ' vocal sounds may help flush the sand lance out of hiding to where they 're scooped up and eaten			1
the clock - like sounds created by whales may also serve as a dinner bell of sorts for other nearby whales during late - night feedings			1
' hints of behaviour suggest that other whales who overhear the sounds are attracted to them and may eavesdrop on other whales hunting for food , ' professor @entity31 added			2
' @entity116 ' : whales ' clock - like sounds may help flush the sand lance out of hiding to where they 're scooped up and eaten			1
the sounds may also serve as a dinner bell of sorts for other nearby whales during feedings			1

whales off coast of @entity78 were tagged with recording devices
study found they made ' tick - tock ' noises while hunting together at night
this helped flush the creatures called sand lance to where they were easily scooped up and eaten by the humpbacks
clock - like sounds may also serve as a dinner bell for other nearby whales
