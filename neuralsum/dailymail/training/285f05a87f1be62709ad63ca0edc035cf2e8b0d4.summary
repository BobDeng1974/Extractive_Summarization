a bride stunned shoppers by visiting a supermarket in her wedding dress to stock up on booze			2
@entity5 had no time to dress down when she called in at @entity6 after tying the knot with husband @entity8 - because there was n’t long before the store was due to close			1
she said she felt no inhibitions because she had previously visited the store in her pyjamas			1
she had no time to change - because the shop was about to shut mrs @entity5 , 39 , and her 26 - year - old husband had tied the knot at @entity24 , @entity25 , and had their ‘ wedding breakfast ’ at a carvery restaurant			1
to keep the cost down , the couple decided to have the evening party at mrs @entity5 ’s mother ’s house			1
the new bride , who dashed around the supermarket in @entity17 , @entity35 , to buy alcohol with her new mother - in - law and sister - in - law , was overwhelmed by the reactions of staff and customers			1
‘ people were smiling and asking for photos			0
it was surreal , ’ said mrs @entity5 , a mother of three			2
‘ i felt like a celebrity			0
i had people saying i looked beautiful and one man said his daughter said i looked like a princess			0
’ the visit to @entity6 was a ‘ very impromptu idea ’ , she admitted			0
something cold , something brewed : mrs @entity5 needed the alcohol for a reception that night at her mother 's house , and said she was unruffled at her surprise appearance because she once visited the store in pyjamas ‘ i decided to go to @entity6 , but it was shutting in 45 minutes so i did n’t have time to go and change			1
‘ but i have been in my pyjamas before , why not in my wedding dress ? ’ mrs @entity5 was congratulated by @entity17 blogger @entity65 who filmed her out shopping and put the video online			1
alongside the video , he wrote : ‘ i ’m smiling and have goose bumps as i type this blog			0
‘ to @entity5 and @entity8 - have a fantastic night and wonderful future together			2
you put a grin on a lot of people ’s faces tonight			0
’ mrs @entity5 ’s choice of shopping attire may have raised no eyebrows at @entity6 but a nearby @entity81 store has previously banned customers from shopping in their pyjamas			1
dash : the new bride went for her lightning - quick trip into this branch of @entity6 in @entity17 , @entity25 low - cost : mrs @entity5 had tied the knot with her husband @entity8 at @entity24 ( pictured ) and had her wedding day breakfast at a carvery restaurant before a party at her mother 's house notices were put up in @entity81 ’s @entity98 branch in @entity99 in 2010 saying : ‘ footwear must be worn at all times and no nightwear is permitted			1
’ one customer , @entity103 , a full - time mother of two , was refused service for wearing pyjamas			2
she described the ban as ‘ ridiculous and pathetic ’			0
she said she had been ‘ popping in for a pack of fags ’ but ‘ would have gone in clothed ’ for a full shop			0
‘ if you ’re allowed to wear jogging bottoms , why are n’t you allowed to wear pyjamas in there ? that ’s what i do n’t understand , ’ she said			0
a @entity81 spokesman said the company did not have a strict dress code but it did not want people shopping in their nightwear in case it offended other customers .			0

@entity5 was tying the knot in bargain *ceremony* in @entity126 , @entity35
she needed alcohol for evening reception and had no time to dress down
so the bride , 39 , made the lightning dash with her new mother - in - law
she felt no inhibitions because she once visited the same @entity6 in pyjamas
' it was shutting in 45 minutes so i did n’t have time to change , ' she said
