militants fighting for the @entity1 in @entity2 are seeking to attract more foreign recruits by opening two english - language schools in the terror group 's de facto capital city			1
activists working undercover in the @entity9 stronghold @entity10 uncovered plans for two schools - one for boys and one for girls - where most lessons will be taught in @entity17 , not the local @entity19 dialect			1
the plans are just @entity9 ' latest attempt to build establish a fully - functioning state within the vast swathes of @entity2 and @entity24 it controls through a campaign of rape , massacre and brutal oppression			0
last summer the terror group declared the territory a so - called caliphate and said it as the duty of all @entity34 around the world to live under the regime			1
since then tens of thousands of foreigners have done just that , with @entity17 becoming a lingua franca among the militants and their families			2
new approach : a poster promoting the schools says that they will cater for children aged between six and 14 , and lessons will run between 9am and midday between saturday and wednesday militants : the schools are just @entity9 ' latest attempt to build establish a fully - functioning state within the vast swathes of @entity2 and @entity24 it controls through a campaign of rape , massacre and brutal oppression details of the two new @entity17 language schools were revealed by a local activist named @entity62 , whose group ' @entity10 is being slaughtered silently ' operate undercover in the city to expose @entity9 atrocities and report on local developments in the terror stronghold			1
he uploaded a photograph to @entity71 showing a typed - poster that had been put up informing local fighters that the two schools are soon to open			2
the poster reads : ' by the grace of @entity77 we have opened schools for @entity17 speaking children			1
the boys school is named @entity81 ( formally known as @entity82 ) and the girls school is called @entity84 and is located next door '			2
it then goes to say that the schools cater for children aged between six and 14 , and lessons are run between 9am and midday between saturday and wednesday			2
the children therefore have thursday and friday as a weekend			0
religious lessons , @entity92 and @entity17 are all taught in @entity17 and take up the majority of the day , although a minority of lessons , such as the teaching of @entity19 and the reading of the @entity98 are conducted in @entity19			1
location : details of the two schools were revealed by a local activist group ' @entity10 is being slaughtered silently ' who later released this map showing where inside the city the education centres will be located the poster gives a phone number for parents to call if they are interested in enrolling their children and instructs them to ask for a militant named @entity113			1
the purpose of opening @entity17 language schools in @entity10 is two-fold - firstly to stop @entity17 - speaking families leaving the territory over concerns about their children 's education , and secondly to raise a generation of bilingual young men to continue the @entity9 reign of terror for years to come			1
the news comes as @entity2 @entity126 forces advanced against @entity1 fighters in two separate attacks in northeastern @entity2 near the @entity24 border on sunday , an organisation tracking the war reported , compounding recent losses for the militant group in @entity2			0
the @entity126 @entity135 militia has been one of @entity1 's toughest enemies in @entity2 and last month flushed the group out of the town of @entity140 with the help of @entity142 and allied air support and @entity24 @entity126 reinforcements on the ground			0
@entity147 province in the northeastern corner of @entity2 is strategically important in the fight against @entity1 because it borders areas controlled by the group in @entity24			0
in an attack backed by @entity142 - led air strikes , the @entity135 advanced to within 3 miles of @entity155 , an @entity1 - controlled town 22 miles southeast of the city of @entity157 , @entity126 official @entity152 said			0
the @entity135 had decided to launch the attack after @entity1 reinforced its positions in the area with foreign fighters			0
it is the latest example of coordination between the @entity142 - led alliance and the @entity135 in the fight against @entity1 , which has seized wide areas of @entity2 and @entity24 and declared them part of a cross-border ' caliphate ' .			0
