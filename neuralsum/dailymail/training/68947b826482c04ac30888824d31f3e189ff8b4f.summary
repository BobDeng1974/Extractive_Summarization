by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 12:42 est , 18 december 2012 this incredible close - up video shows how life operates on the microscopic level			1
@entity4 , a teacher from @entity5 , @entity6 , captured the fascinating 58 - second film showing the super-fast movements of tiny freshwater rotifers , whose hairlike cilia beat constantly to sweep food into their mouths			1
the movie depicts colonies of the minuscule creatures found on a lily leaf in mr @entity4 's own pond , their spot - like red eyes and internal organs captured through the use of differential interference contrast illumination			1
for his efforts mr @entity4 was awarded first prize in the 2012 @entity26 , which every year celebrates the best in microscopic photography			1
the first video ever to capture the competition 's top spot , it was selected from more than 2000 entries and earned mr @entity4 $ 5,000 ( £ 3,000 ) worth of @entity26 equipment			1
now in its ninth year , the @entity36 awards prizes of microscopic images and movies of human , plant and animal subjects as captured through light microscopes			1
any life science subject is eligible , and entries are judged based on the science they depict , their aesthetics ( beauty and impact of the image ) , and their technical expertise			0
second prize : @entity55 , showing reproductive tetraspores and golden diatoms , by @entity58 , from @entity59 , @entity60 third prize : a common east - coast fern , @entity63 , showing a cluster of spore - filled sporangia and protective hairs called paraphyses , by @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 the 2012 winning images and movies reflect the latest advances in neuroscience and cell biology documented by researchers , along with amazing glimpses of life on a microscopic scale captured by hobbyists , students and other photographers			1
specimens represent animal , plant and human subjects			0
for example , @entity89 went to a beautiful image of branching red algae captured by @entity58 of @entity59 , @entity60			1
animal subjects are highlighted in vivid colours and rarely seen detail in several winning images this year			2
fourth prize : claw of the crustacean amphipode @entity100 , with muscles and rows of pigment cells visible , by @entity104 , of @entity105 , @entity106 , and @entity107 , of @entity108 , @entity109 fifth prize : @entity113 green alga @entity111 from lake sample			0
twenty - two stacked images , captured using differential interference contrast by @entity117 , from @entity118 , @entity119 sixth prize : close - up of the mouth of live mushroom coral @entity123 during expansion			1
captured using tungsten illumination by @entity127 , of the @entity130 / @entity129 / @entity128 , @entity131 , @entity132 for instance , @entity104 and @entity107 of @entity135 , @entity133 , @entity106 , and @entity108 , @entity134 , @entity109 , respectively , earned @entity137 for a glowing image of a crustacean ’s claw			2
@entity127 of the @entity130 / @entity129 / @entity128 , @entity141 , @entity131 , @entity132 , captured a brilliant golden coral ’s open mouth for his @entity145 honor			2
@entity147 and @entity148 of the @entity149 , @entity146 took @entity150 for a photo of a fruit fly ’s brain			0
and @entity154 of @entity155 , @entity60 , captured a @entity157 close - up of gossamer butterfly wings in shades of orange and purple			1
plant images also earned top 10 status			0
@entity117 of @entity118 , @entity119 , captured an extraordinary @entity165 photo of a one - celled green alga found in a lake			2
the @entity169 image captured by @entity170 of @entity171 , @entity172 , depicts a common weed called henbit in a striking , almost architectural light			2
a @entity178 flower seed now looks like an intricately crocheted corsage in a @entity181 image captured by @entity182 of the @entity183 in @entity184			0
seventh prize : beta - tubulin expression of a @entity188 third instar larval brain , with eye imaginal discs			0
captured with confocal microscopy by @entity191 and @entity148 , of @entity149 , @entity146 @entity193 prize : @entity194 ( @entity195 ) stamens anthers and filaments			0
the stamen is the male reproductive part of the flower			0
captured using phase contrast illumination by @entity170 , from @entity171 , @entity172 ninth prize : seed of @entity178			0
the image was acquired from multiple @entity207 images using epi - fluorescence by @entity182 , of the @entity183 , in @entity209 , @entity184 tenth prize : @entity212 ' @entity211 ' ( @entity213 ) wing scales magnified 200x			0
image captured using diffused reflected illumination by @entity154 , from @entity155 , @entity60 ' these fascinating and beautiful images tell important stories that shed light on the living universe around us , showing us the intimate structures and dynamic events of life in ways that we can not ordinarily see , ' said @entity227 of @entity228			0
' @entity230 movies and still images remind us of the fascination and beauty of the natural world , and highlight important work going on in laboratories across the globe			0
' the @entity36 , with entries from an everincreasing number of countries and very diverse life science fields , allows @entity26 to bring amazing images and stories to the attention of scientists and non-scientists alike			2
' the winners were announced on sunday night at a grand gala reception in @entity248			1
a selection of the 2012 winning and @entity252 mention images and videos will be displayed in a museum tour that will travel the @entity255 over the coming year .			1

video of bugs in an @entity6 man 's *garden* pond is the winner of this year 's @entity26
it shows colonies of tiny freshwater rotifers , with spot - like red eyes and internal organs captured by a special technique
winner and ten *runners* up of the competition were announced in @entity248 and will now go on museum tour of the @entity255
