by @entity0 published : 05:45 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 05:45 est , 4 october 2013 a neolithic bow and arrows that could have been used to hunt reindeer thousands of years ago , have been discovered in a patch of melting snow , archaeologists said			1
the ancient artefacts , the oldest of which is approximately 5,400 - years - old , were found in the mountains of @entity11			1
the scientists who came across them , believe the discovery demonstrates the worrying effects of climate change , as precious finds are being exposed			1
a neolithic bow and arrows that could have been used to hunt reindeer have been discovered in a patch of melting snow			2
the oldest of the arrows ( pictured ) is 5,400 - years - old			0
the bow and arrow design is strikingly similar to those found in other frigid locales , such as the @entity29 , the archaeologists said the bow ( pictured ) made of elm , was about 3,800 years old , the archaeologists said @entity32 , an archaeologist at the @entity33 , told @entity34 : ' it 's actually a little bit unnerving that they 're so old and that they 're coming out right now			1
it tells us there 's something changing			0
' dr @entity32 and his team have spent recent summers hiking the @entity46 and @entity47 mountains to study the rate of snow melt and trawl the area , south of @entity51 , for artefacts left behind by ancient hunters			1
they said the mountains tower some 6,200 feet above sea level and at their peaks , only rocks and snow are seen			0
over the summers of 2010 and 2011 the team stumbled across a patch of melting snow that gave up an ancient bow and several arrows that had been buried in the hard snow - ice for centuries			2
upon closer inspection they found the bow was made from elm wood , which grows at lower altitudes in the mountain range and near the coast , while the arrow tips were made from slate			1
however , they said in a study , published in the journal @entity80 , that after dating the finds they now believe the bow is 3,800 - years - old , while the oldest arrow dates back an incredible 5,400 - years			2
dr @entity32 and his team think the hunting tools were used by @entity87 men to kill reindeer , which keep cool in the summer by staying on the higher parts of the mountain range			0
the scientists suggest that the animals ' cool retreat gave them a break from annoying insects and the heat , but their predictable patterns probably made them a relatively easy target for hunters			0
while there is no evidence of who the arrows and bows belonged to , but they are similar in design to some found thousands of miles away in similarly chilly environments			0
dr @entity32 ( centre ) and his team have spent recent summers hiking the @entity46 and @entity47 mountains ( pictured ) to study the rate of snow melt and trawl the area , south of @entity51 , for artefacts left behind by ancient hunters in 2010 and 2011 , the team noticed that a snow patch that had been there for centuries had melted , revealing an ancient bow and arrows			1
@entity32 and his team think the hunting tools ( pictured ) were used by @entity87 men to kill reindeer dr @entity32 said : ' the people in @entity11 , they did n't have any contact with people in the @entity29 , but they have the same type of adaptation			2
' however , he said that different cultures living in similar environments acted in the same way			0
while the find is no doubt a valuable insight into how stone age man lived thousands of years ago , another archaeologist who was not involved in the study , @entity133 @entity132 , director of the @entity134 at the @entity135 , said that if climate chnage is causing the ancient snow to melt , it is bad for archaeology , artifacts can be preserved for thousands of years in the ice , but when it melts they can quickly decompose , he warned			2
' for every artifact we find , there are probably hundreds , maybe thousands , that are lost and just destroyed forever , ' dr @entity132 said			0
other scientists believe global warming is leading to an increasing number of archaeological discoveries in cold and icy regions			0
melting snow has recently revealed a remarkably intact woolly jumper likely worn by a fashion - conscious reindeer hunter some 1,700 years ago			0
the find , which sheds more light on the life of people living in the @entity164 , was found two years ago in @entity11 , but has recently been examined by scientists			1
@entity166 , from the @entity167 and @entity168 , from the @entity33 in @entity51 , told @entity169 : ' due to global warming , rapid melting of snow patches and glaciers is taking place in the mountains of @entity11 as in other parts of the world , and hundreds of archaeological finds emerge from the ice each year			1
' the tunic was crafted from wool woven in diamond twill , which was apparently fashionable at the time and was made between 230 and 390 ad			0
it was worn by someone living in the hunting area of the @entity11 @entity188 glacier , at around 6,560 feet above sea level , where it was found .			1

the ancient artefacts were found in the @entity194 and @entity47 mountains a few hours south of @entity51 in @entity11
archaeologists from the @entity33 believe the discovery demonstrates the worrying effects of climate change
the bow is made from elm wood that would have been found on the lower part of the mountains , while the arrow tips are made from slate
