gastric dysrhythmia is a condition that causes the stomach to automatically empty			1
as soon as any food enters the stomach , the condition causes a sufferer to vomit , expelling it immediately			1
it is connected to a similar condition gastroparesis - a neuromuscular disorder of the stomach			1
gastric dysrythmias are caused when electrical signals governing the function of the stomach are disturbed , leading to nausea and vomiting			2
it is a broad term covering a range of illnesses			0
' i was told i was allowed to eat solid food at the same time , but whenever i did the tube became dislodged when i was inevitably sick afterwards			2
' i was even put on a course of anti-psychotic medication which really spaced me out			0
' i began to think that the problems really were just all in my mind - after all that was anyone 's best guess at the time			0
' the following summer , doctors concerned at @entity133 's mounting depression booked her in for an appointment at the @entity136 in @entity137 , where she was given a meal of scrambled eggs laced with radioactive tracer to monitor the passage of food through her body			2
it was then that doctors saw that her stomach was expelling food completely from her stomach			2
an appointment with a specialist at the @entity153 in @entity40 in january 2010 confirmed that she had gastric arrhythmia - a condition which interrupts the stomach 's ability to hold and process food and liquid			1
she said : ' it was nice that people were listening to me after so long			0
i thought , " at least something 's going to get done now "			0
' there were two options - have @entity6 to firm up the tissue in my stomach , or a pacemaker - like device in my stomach			1
the plan was to try the @entity6 first and see what happened			2
' after being referred to see a specialist at @entity136 's in @entity137 , miss @entity7 was finally diagnosed with the stomach condition			1
she now requires @entity6 injections every six months to keep the illness at bay in may 2010 , surgeons gave @entity133 , who is engaged to automotive engineer @entity85 , 22 , her first injection through a needle mounted on a camera which was guided down her throat			1
she said : ' it took a few days to start working , but then when it did work , it was amazing			0
' i had my first solid food - mashed potato with cheese - a week after the first injection			2
having been suffering for more than a year , it was revelation to be able to digest solid food again			2
shortly after that i said goodbye to the feeding tube forever			0
' miss @entity7 's weight is now stable at seven stone but she requires @entity6 injections every six months to make sure that the gastric dysrhythmia does not return			1

' i ca n't eat food which is too rich or creamy			2
i ca n't overeat - if i push myself , it does n't stay down			0
' i 'd heard of @entity6 being used medically to cure bladder conditions before - but not the stomach			1
' when i tell people , some people are surprised , and think that such treatment is just for cosmetic purposes			0
i thought ' how 's it going to work ? ' i was happy to go along with it if there was a chance it was going to be effective - and i 'm so glad it was			0
' i love stew and dumplings and sausage casserole - home cooking that my nan used to make			0
i also like chicken pie			0
' i appreciate food much more now that i 've been through this experience			0
