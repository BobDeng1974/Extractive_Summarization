if the worst - case scenario predictions about rising sea levels are accurate , the majority of @entity1 could one day be lost underwater			1
using estimates from the @entity5 , an urban planner has created a series of maps to show what damage could be caused if the ice sheets melt due to climate change			1
the only areas that would escape the worst of the flooding would be the highest points in the capital including @entity17 , @entity18 and parts of @entity20			1
this @entity28 shows @entity1 following a 131ft ( 40 metre ) rise up to an 262ft ( 80 metre ) rise in global water levels the maps and @entity28 were designed by visual artist @entity31 for his @entity33 site			1
he is currently working on a graphic novel with the @entity35 to show how parts of the @entity37 would look in 200 years if nothing is done to curb carbon emissions			0
according to the @entity5 , @entity41 ’s climate has warmed around 1 ° @entity42 ) over the past 100 years			1
if present trends continue , including an increase in global temperatures caused by increased greenhouse - gas emissions , it predicts many of the world ’s mountain glaciers will disappear			0
for example , at the current rate of melting , most glaciers will vanish from @entity54 , @entity55 , by the middle of the next century			0

this map shows @entity1 following a 181ft ( 40 - metre ) rise complete melting of ice sheets could lead to a sea - level rise of about 262ft ( 80 metres ) , according to the @entity5			1
if this happened , the only areas that would escape the worst of the flooding would be the highest points in the capital including @entity17 , @entity18 and parts of @entity20 and in @entity73 , glaciers will decrease by 40 per cent by 2100 and virtually disappear by 2200			1
most of the current global land ice mass is located in the @entity26 and @entity27 ice sheets , and complete melting of these ice sheets could lead to a sea - level rise of about 262ft ( 80 metres )			1
mr @entity31 used this figure to show what @entity1 would look like if half of these ice sheets melted , and if they melted completely			1
he does n't put a timeframe on when this could potentially occur			0
the designer has previously made maps showing how @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 would similarly look underwater			1
last year , the @entity91 created a similar map to mr @entity31 's that highlighted what @entity1 would look like if sea levels continue to rise and the @entity95 was n’t there to protect it			1
parts of @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 are shown under water ( pictured ) last year , the @entity91 created a similar map to mr @entity31 's that highlighted what @entity1 would look like if sea levels continue to rise and the @entity95 was n’t there to protect it			1
in particular , the map highlights what would happen if the capital was hit by ' severe ' tidal surges			2
parts of @entity98 , @entity109 , @entity99 and @entity100 are all shown completely submerged with only a handful of spots across the floodplain escaping the flooding			2
melting ice from the poles could make sea levels rise by up to three feet by the end of the century , according to academics from the @entity120 programme , the @entity122 and @entity121			2
they claim there is a one in 20 chance that ocean levels around the @entity37 coast could be around a metre higher by 2100 as a result of climate change			2
the movable @entity95 is made up of 10 gates attached to 128ft ( 39 - metre ) tall cofferdam piles , which are buried 79ft ( 24 metres ) into the river bed			1
individual gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes an hour and half to close completely			0
when fully raised , the barrier creates a solid steel wall preventing water flowing upstream towards the capital			2
the four main gates span 200ft ( 61 metres ) and weigh over 3,300 tonnes each			2
each gate is 66ft ( 20 metres ) high and can hold back loads of up to 9,000 tonnes			2
a separate map released earlier this week revealed how @entity144 could undergo devastating increases in temperature , rainfall and sea level as a result of global warming			1
a @entity152 - backed report predicts annual temperatures will increase 4.1 ° f to 5.7 ° f by the 2050s and 5.3 ° f to 8.8 ° f by the 2080s			0
the frequency of heat waves is set rise to two per year in the 1980s to roughly six per year by the 2080s			0
a separate map has revealed how @entity144 could be devastated by increases in rainfall and sea level			1
large areas of @entity167 ( light green ) will be hit by floods in the 2020s , while areas of @entity172 and the @entity173 ( yellow ) will face the same fate in the 2050s			1
the purple shows the high - risk zones in @entity144 pictured are observed and projected temperature in @entity144			1
the frequency of heat waves is set rise to two per year in the 1980s to roughly six per year by the 2080s , according to the report the predictions were made by the @entity184 on @entity185 ( @entity186 ) 2015 , which is co-chaired by @entity152 researcher , @entity187			1
while @entity144 summers will get even hotter , rainfall will increase four to 11 per cent by the 2050s and five to 13 per cent by the 2080s , the report predicts			2
sea levels have already risen in @entity144 1.1ft ( 0.3 metres ) since 1900			1
that is almost twice the observed global rate of 0.5 to 0.7 inches per decade			0
map of annual temperature changes in the @entity198 in 2050			2
in @entity144 , @entity152 predicts annual temperatures will increase 4.1 ° f to 5.7 ° f by the 2050s and 5.3 ° f to 8.8 ° f by the 2080s the report also uses @entity203 7 data to map the surface temperature of mid-town @entity206 and show the cooling effect of @entity208 ( pictured ) the group created the map which reveals how large areas of @entity167 will be hit by floods in the 2020s , while areas of @entity172 and the @entity173 will face the same fate in the 2050s			1
coastal areas of @entity219 and @entity206 will be battling high tides as sea level rises 10 inches in as little as five years , the report claims			0
the @entity186 report follows a separate study which found the western @entity224 will face increasingly severe mega-droughts later this century			2
since the year 2000 , seven western states in the @entity224 has seen their driest periods in centuries			0
these states are @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 and scientists in @entity231 have warned that the region may be experiencing a century - long ' mega-drought '			0
the warnings came after sediment studies showed @entity231 is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580 , and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years			0
in 2013 , @entity231 received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850			0
however droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state			0
looking back over several thousand years , droughts have been known to last over a decade , and in some cases they can last a century			0
and the patterns tend to repeat , meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future			0
projections for sea level rise in @entity144 will increase from 11 inches to 21 inches by the 2050s , 18 inches to 39 inches by the 2080s , and , 22 inches to 50 inches			2
in the worst case , sea levels will rise by up to six feet ( 1.8 metres ) , by 2100			1
last year , the @entity91 created a similar map to mr @entity31 's that highlighted what @entity1 would look like if sea levels continue to rise and the @entity95 was n’t there to protect it			1

they claim there is a one in 20 chance that ocean levels around the @entity37 coast could be around a metre higher by 2100 as a result of climate change			0
if such rises were to take place , @entity1 ’s current sea defences would struggle to cope , with the capital at risk of flooding once a decade			1
the movable barrier is made up of 10 gates attached to 39 - metre tall cofferdam piles , which are buried 24 metres into the river bed			2
individual gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes an hour and half to close completely			0
when fully raised , the barrier creates a solid steel wall preventing water flowing upstream towards the capital			0
the four main gates span 200ft ( 61 metres ) and weigh over 3,300 tonnes each			0
each gate is 66ft ( 20 metres ) high and can hold back loads of up to 9,000 tonnes			0
the @entity95 ( pictured ) was opened in 1982 and is a 520m - long flood defence system near @entity309 in east @entity1			2
individual gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes an hour and half to close completely			0
the barrier can hold back up to 9,000 tonnes of water to protect @entity1 from flooding			1

the maps were created by urban planner and visual artist @entity31
it reveals how @entity1 would look under 40 metres and 80 metres of water
levels are based on predictions made by the @entity5
people in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity20 would escape the worst of the flooding
a separate map shows how @entity144 could be *affected* by floods in 2020s
