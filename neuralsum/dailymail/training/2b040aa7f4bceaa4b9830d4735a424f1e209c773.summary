by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is ready to hit the road again			1
not only on @entity5 ’s pre-season training camp in @entity6 but also for another season away from @entity8 as he continues his quest to impress @entity10			1
after six months with @entity11 in @entity12 and a prolific season at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity2 is preparing for another loan move , possibly to @entity17 because @entity10 is keen to see him tested in a tougher competition , like the @entity19			1
the @entity5 boss will watch with interest			1
as will an audience in @entity23			1
@entity2 possesses the poise and elegance missing from @entity27 ’s team at the @entity28 and many hope this is the season when he makes a stride towards realising his huge potential			1
out to impress : @entity5 's @entity2 , 20 , will go out on loan again this season , likely to the @entity19 proving himself : @entity2 ( left ) has played three times for @entity5 , with time spent time in @entity12 and @entity15 several talented young footballers will exit @entity40 on loan before the end of august to a temporary new home in a new environment , all of them after the same result			1
' i will try to keep improving myself and have a good season , ' said @entity2 , still only 20 and under contract until 2017			1
' it is time for me to grow up and do something that will keep me in the plans for @entity5			1
' it ’s where i want to play			2
it ’s a club i really like and where the people treat me well from the day i first arrived			0
if not , i must show another club what i can do but i came from @entity23 when i was 17 to play for @entity5 and that is still the target for my career			1
' i know it is difficult , they have the best players in the world			0
that ’s why we are all going on loan , to improve ourselves and try to be back one day			2
the young players always talk about it			0
we say : " it ’s time to go on loan again , meet new people and find a new coach "			2
sometimes it ’s hard but it ’s necessary if you want to reach where you really want to be			0
ups and downs : @entity2 had a stellar start to the season with @entity14 scoring 11 in 16 games , but fell away proving himself : although he 's been sent away from @entity85 , @entity2 believes he made the right move ' you get the wrong loan and you lose one year from your career			1
every single loan , every single season is important for a footballer			1
or you find the right loan and you get minutes , confidence and experience ; you get the rhythm of the game			2
it is good to be playing every week			0
when you ‘ re not playing you ’re not happy			0
' @entity2 had a sweet and sour time at @entity14 , the @entity100 club with a special relationship with @entity5			1
he started in sublime touch , scoring 11 in his first 16 games as @entity14 raced away to the top of the league			1
they were daring to dream in @entity107 of their first ever title and the @entity110 when the season collapsed			2
weight of a nation : @entity2 could be part of the new breed of @entity23 to turn the national team 's fortunes around they won only four of 19 after the mid-winter break and finished in sixth , missing out on @entity121 , and @entity2 did not score another goal			1
he was dropped in the @entity123 and unhappy that he seemed to be singled out as a scapegoat for the team ’s loss of impetus by manager @entity128			0
' everybody was going crazy , saying : what ’s happening ? ' said @entity2			1
' the coach was like this , too			0
and he changed just one player , as if i was the only problem			0
i do n’t think i should have been the one to blame but that was his choice			0
' in the end , i think everyone could see i was n’t the problem			0
he chose to take me out and after this we won only three games			0
we finished sixth and lost at home in the play - offs			1
if he wanted change , he had to change more people than just myself			0
' i decided i had to wait for the season to finish and then find a new beginning			2
but now when i look back , i ’m pleased with my time at @entity14			2
it ’s a nice club			0
i arrived and started a game three days later , i scored some goals and played some minutes			0
we were top after 20 games			2
' after this experience , there was no question of him returning , but his goals in @entity15 made an impact in @entity23 and @entity2 received his first international call - up since the @entity163 in @entity164 in 2011 , the same year he left @entity165 for @entity5			1
he was called into the @entity167 squad for the @entity169 tournament , made three appearances , scored once and flew home with a winners ’ medal to enjoy the @entity28			0
finding success : @entity2 kneels with @entity175 after @entity23 won the @entity177 final in june ' after almost three years outside the @entity23 squad , it was good to play with a few of the guys i knew from before , ' said @entity2 , who had played youth football at @entity165 with @entity184 , voted the best player at @entity169 , and midfield playmaker @entity186			1
both have broken into @entity165 ’s senior squad but @entity2 has no regrets about his decision to move to @entity121 at 17			1
were he still at his former club , he would be competing for a place in the attacking unit with the formidable trio of @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197			0
here , he may be about to leave on loan again but there are signs of progress and encouragement which @entity5 hope will mature and flourish this season			1
' the move to @entity121 has been good for me , ' @entity2 said			2
' i ’m ok with my career			0
i played in @entity15 and three games at @entity5			2
i did n’t make a mistake			0
it was the right choice			0
i was 17 in @entity165 and i was training with the @entity212 , so i think it was the best thing for me at that moment			0
i hope i ’m right			0

@entity2 has spent loan stints with @entity11 and @entity14 since *joining* @entity5
the @entity23 20 - year - old is likely to be tested in the @entity19 this season
he signed with @entity5 as a 17 - year - old and is contracted until 2017
@entity2 says he came from @entity23 to play for @entity5 and that is his mission
