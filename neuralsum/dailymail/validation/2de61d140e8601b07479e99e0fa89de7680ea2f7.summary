@entity0 is up to 30 per cent cheaper than the ‘ big five ’ supermarkets despite the fact they have been cutting prices on shopping basket essentials			1
the budget chain continues to undercut the giants on everything from fruit and vegetables to eggs and pasta , an independent study found			1
@entity0 came out cheapest on a basket of 33 commonly bought items at a total of £ 42.15 , a saving of almost £ 8 compared to the £ 50.11 charged by @entity18			1
@entity19 was next best at £ 53.97 , then @entity20 on £ 54.29 and @entity21 at £ 59.98			2
an new study has found that @entity0 , pictured , continues to undercut the big five supermarkets on everything from produce to eggs and pasta the @entity28 retailer was a remarkable £ 18 – 29.9 per cent – cheaper than @entity29 ’s , which came in at £ 60.15 in the survey by @entity31			1
the figures suggest that families could comfortably save more than £ 1,000 a year by switching to a budget supermarket			1
the mainstream stores insist the figures are not a fair reflection of prices			2
however it is clear customers believe the discount chains really do make their money go further			0
@entity0 ’s sales are up 19.3 per cent on a year ago , giving it a market share of 5 per cent , which is almost on a par with @entity21			1
the growth of @entity0 and its rival @entity49 has triggered the greatest change in shopping habits since the 1950s when the large supermarkets first arrived to push aside independent traders			1
studies suggest their combination of low prices and awards for their upmarket ranges of food and drink has successfully attracted the ‘ @entity62 classes ’ to their no - frills outlets			0
the mainstream stores , which have lost millions of customers , have responded by slashing prices on high profile items such as milk and bread , which is hurting their finances			1
@entity19 has issued a series of profit warnings and @entity20 last week announced trading profits have halved			0
even @entity21 has been dragged into the price war and has just reported a 24 per cent fall in annual profits			0
such has been the impact of price cuts that it is now cheaper to feed a family than a year ago , and @entity82 inflation is expected to show @entity83 is about to enter its first period of deflation since the 1960s			1
research by retail analysts @entity87 ! has revealed a significant change in the type of people shopping at @entity0 and @entity49			2
the proportion who are in the wealthiest ab demographic category is up from 12 per cent in 2013 to 31 per cent today			0
however , the low prices are part of a package which means service at the budget chains is often below what people have come to expect			0
the @entity102 found @entity0 came bottom in terms of store layout , clutter in the aisles and difficulty getting through the ‘ illogical , frantic and cramped check - out ’			2
@entity29 ’s said the figures in the study were skewed by the fact it covers only a small number of the many thousands of items it stocks			1
it said it was very easy to identify products that are around the same figure as @entity0 , such as onions , cornflakes , jam and @entity122 butter			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we do n’t think this price comparison is fair			0
‘ it ’s a very small selection of products that changes every week			0
it is a randomness that ca n’t ever really equal fairness			0
it also does n’t match up with our internal data or external data sources			0
' we have plenty of data like this which demonstrates that we have never been more competitive on price			0
