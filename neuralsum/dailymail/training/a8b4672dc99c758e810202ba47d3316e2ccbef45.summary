a temporary piece of artwork painted onto @entity2 in celebration of the area 's sheep - farming community has been turned into ' graffiti ' after it failed to ' wash away ' in the rain			1
the 100ft mural - which consisted of a poem written by @entity11 ' national poet - was painted onto a cliff face near @entity13 as part of @entity15 , an outdoor performance staged by the @entity17 of @entity11			1
the four - hour performance used the national park 's landscape to tell the story of ancient farming techniques and involved herding the audience around the mountain			1
the poem , one of the main features of the production , was meant to ' wash off ' in the rain once the performances were over - a crucial caveat when the artwork was granted permission			1
a temporary 100ft mural of a poem used in an outdoor theatre performance has been labelled as ' graffiti ' after it failed to wash away in the rain from the lower slopes of @entity2 but now the mural has been branded as ' graffiti ' after a hotter - than - average summer left the paint to be imprinted onto the rock			1
the @entity44 told @entity45 it was ' genuinely sorry ' that the removal of the paint is taking ' longer than anticipated '			2
but @entity47 , director of the @entity48 , said the mural had left permanent damage on the base of the mountain and that the episode showed a lack of consideration for the national park			1
he said : ' we have some sympathy with the @entity17 for @entity11			1
they had an idea and they asked the relevant people for permission			0
but i just do not think the relevant guidance was really that good			0
' it does look rather like graffiti - it 's hard to call it anything else			2
' we would hope lessons are learned and that more respect and consideration is given in the future to the landscape that , at least in part , they ( the theatre ) were celebrating			0
' the mural formed part of @entity15 , an outdoor production staged in the national park by the @entity17 of @entity11 @entity83 was given for the mural by the @entity85 , which owns the land , on the basis the paint would wash off in the rain			1
but attempts by the @entity44 to clear it away - and ' return the site to its original state - have so far failed			2
mr @entity47 says there have been two types of damage caused by the mural			0
he said the aesthetics of the rock have not only been ruined , but that is has had long - term damage on the environment			2
he said there is centuries - old lichen growing on the rock , which will be unavoidably removed in the aggressive cleaning process			2
he added : ' by all accounts it was a great event which is why what has happened is a real shame			0
but the national park is a very precious resource , it 's our world - famous brand and it 's precious for all its features			2
the mural was painted onto a cliff face near @entity13 in @entity119 , shown here above ' a really wonderful event has unfortunately left a very bad taste			1
' @entity122 , recently climbing in the area on holiday , told the @entity125 : ' they are left with probably the biggest piece of graffiti in the @entity128 in a national park , and it looks awful			1
' a spokesman for the @entity17 for @entity11 said : ' the poetry written on the rock face near @entity134 was part of @entity11 ’ production @entity137			1
' the production involved a series of temporary installations , developed in collaboration with @entity142 y @entity134 farm and the @entity85 , highlighting the life and activity of the farm			2
' the intention with all the installations was to return the whole site to its original state			0
despite detailed research , the removal of the poetry on the rock face is taking longer than anticipated			0
' following consultation with the @entity85 , the words in this installation were written in a natural , clay - based paint , which is non-harmful			1
after the performance , the vast majority of the paint was removed , but some of the words remained visible			0
' a team has begun a second phase of cleaning the site this week , according to the expert advice we have been given			0
we are loath to make any attempts to clean the rock in any way that is not recommended by ecologists , though we are seeking further advice			0
' we will repeat this cleaning process until all the paint has been removed			0
' we are genuinely sorry that it is taking this long , but it is our priority to put things right as soon as possible			0
a @entity85 spokesman said : ' this @entity11 production of @entity137 / @entity15 was a powerful depiction of life in the hills , and shone a light on the work and dramatic landscape of this iconic part of @entity11			1
' naturally as such a special corner of @entity11 and a site of @entity189 ( @entity190 ) the theatre were very thorough in all their four years of community work and research			2
the production team worked closely with all the relevant authorities to ensure that the materials used would cause no harm to the surroundings			0
' national poet of wales @entity199 ’s poem was written on bare rock with a non harmful clay based product designed to wash away in the rain			1
' however , the unseasonably dry weather in september has meant that her powerful words have remained visible longer than expected			0
with @entity210 now upon us nature can take its course and continue to wash away the poem			0

@entity17 of @entity11 *hosted* four - hour show called @entity15
