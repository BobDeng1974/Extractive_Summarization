huge amounts of dissolved iron currently being released into the oceans from melting ice sheets might cancel out some of the negative effects of global warming , it has been claimed			2
a @entity8 team has discovered that summer meltwaters from ice sheets are rich in iron			0
this can cause an increase in growth of phytoplankton - which capture carbon , they say			1
figures released earlier this week show the @entity19 is now losing 159 @entity20 of ice each year , enough to raise global sea levels by 0.45 millimetres per year			1
a @entity8 team has discovered that summer meltwaters from ice sheets are rich in iron , whihch can cause an increase in growth of phytoplankton - which capture carbon , they say			1
it is well known that bioavailable iron boosts phytoplankton growth in many of the @entity35 's oceans			2
in turn phytoplankton capture carbon – thus buffering the effects of global warming			1
the plankton also feed into the bottom of the oceanic food chain , thus providing a food source for marine animals			0
the researchers say this could effectively ' buffer ' the effect of global warming			0
the plankton also feed into the bottom of the oceanic food chain , thus providing a food source for marine animals			0
the findings , reported in the journal @entity55 , give new insight into how global warming is affected out planet 's ecosystem			0
' the @entity60 and @entity19 cover around 10 % of global land surface , ' said @entity62 of @entity63 , the lead author			0
' iron exported in icebergs from these ice sheets have been recognised as a source of iron to the oceans for some time			0
' our finding that there is also significant iron discharged in runoff from large ice sheet catchments is new			2
' the team , comprising researchers from the universities of @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and the @entity82 , collected meltwater discharged from the 600 km2 @entity84 in @entity60 over the summer of 2012 , which was subsequently tested for bioavailable iron content			0
@entity87 means that the polar oceans receive a seasonal iron boost as the glaciers melt , researchers say despite the catasprophic effects of climate change of some parts of the world , researchers say there are some positive effects			1
they include increased land for agriculture : presently , vast swaths of the @entity35 — the northern half of @entity101 , for instance , and the majority of @entity105 ’s land area — are n’t suitable for agriculture longer growing seasons - and even two harvest less energy needed for heating @entity112 resources become available boost in alternative energy research the researchers found that the water exiting from beneath the melting ice sheet contained significant quantities of previously - unconsidered bioavailable iron			1
this means that the polar oceans receive a seasonal iron boost as the glaciers melt			1
' this means that relatively high iron concentrations are released from the ice sheet all summer , providing a continuous source of iron to the coastal ocean , ' said @entity62			1
' this is a substantial release of iron from the ice sheet , similar in size to that supplied to the oceans by atmospheric dust , another major iron source to the world 's oceans			1
' at the moment it is just too early to estimate how much additional iron will be carried down from ice sheets into the sea			0
' of course , the iron release from ice sheet will be localised to the @entity146 around the ice sheets , so the importance of glacial iron there will be significantly higher			2
' researchers have already noted that glacial meltwater run - off is associated with large phytoplankton blooms - this may help to explain why '			0
