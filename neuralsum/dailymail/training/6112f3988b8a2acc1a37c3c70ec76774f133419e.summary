by @entity1 reporter published : 06:45 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 11:23 est , 28 september 2012 a mother - of - two fears she may never walk again after falling 10ft down a concrete hole while on a dream in holiday in @entity8			1
@entity9 , 48 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , was knocked unconscious , suffered cuts and bruises , damaged her coccyx and fractured her spine in three places			1
the nurse was on the last day of a holiday in @entity8 for her niece 's wedding last year when the accident happened			1
terrifying : @entity9 , 48 , fell 10ft down a concrete hole while on a dream holiday in @entity8 she was walking over a hole which had been covered by a piece of wood at the when it suddenly gave way and she plummeted 10ft to the concrete - lined surface below			1
@entity9 suspects the sheet of wood , which had been painted green , collapsed because it was rotten			2
she spent the next three nights in a @entity8 hospital terrified because she had no idea what injuries she had suffered and very few staff spoke @entity37			2
after being flown home in a fully reclined position she had to wear a back brace for three months			0
almost a year later , @entity9 is still unable to walk properly			1
she has had to undergo surgery to her back and still needs crutches to help her with day - to - day tasks			2
she said : ' we had all been so excited for our holiday in @entity8 and to see my niece @entity47 get married			1
' it was beautiful and the wedding day was perfect but the memories have been ruined forever by what happened on my last day out there			0
' ruined : @entity9 , pictured between her daughters @entity55 , 24 , and @entity56 , 21 , had been enjoying her niece 's wedding in @entity8 when the she fell down a 10ft concrete hole in the grounds of her hotel ( right ) ' i did n’t even notice the hole cover because it was painted green presumably to be concealed within the grass and it gave way before i even realised what i was standing on			1
' it was only afterwards that i saw that the cover was not only just a sheet of wood but it also looked like it was rotten			0
frightening : @entity9 fears she may never walk again after having surgery on her back ' i banged my head in the fall and i think that i was knocked out			1
' ' when i came round i started screaming because of the pain but the only way to get out of the hole was to climb a ladder that the hotel lowered down			0
' it took every ounce of energy in my body to do it and i was in agony			0
' i could n’t understand what was going on in the hospital because not many people spoke @entity37 and i was terrified that i would never walk again			0
' i was eventually allowed to fly home but under strict conditions that i was to be fully reclined throughout and that i sought immediate follow up care upon my return			0
' thankfully , the medics in the @entity93 have been fantastic but i still have a long way to go and i am still not sure what my future holds			0
' @entity97 , a specialist lawyer in accidents abroad at @entity99 , is representing @entity9 against the tour operator @entity100 he said : ' this is a horrendous case that has left a woman who was very dedicated to her profession and caring for others , unable to work and virtually housebound			2
' the terrible injuries she sustained are likely to affect her life forever			0
nightmare : @entity9 's horrendous injuries included a damaged coccyx and a fractured spine in three places ' we are pleased to hear the hotel has apparently since taken measures to ensure the area is safe			1
' at this stage liability has not yet been admitted by @entity93 and i understand that they are investigating the circumstances of the accident with the hotel management			0
' i hope , however , that the tour operator will work with us swiftly to ensure that @entity9 has access to the best support and rehabilitation services possible so she can try and rebuild her life and get some freedom back			2
