this is what happens when a herd of elephants find a @entity5 camera recording			1
@entity6 and @entity7 left their video camera near to a watering hole where they had hoped to film two wild dogs they had spotted in @entity14 in @entity15 during a trip in september			1
while they were waiting for the dogs to show up , a group bull elephants unexpectedly approached the device and began playing with it			1
one of the elephants even put the camera in its mouth before spitting it out and giving it a few thumps with his foot on the floor			1
describing the encounter , @entity7 wrote online : ‘ @entity6 was on the edge of his nerves concerned for the safety of the camera			1
he was cursing the elephants from afar – he even gave an almighty whistle and shouted ‘ leave the camera alone ’ from the platform			2
’ @entity7 works as a film - maker , creating promotional videos for @entity42			1

photographers @entity6 and @entity7 left their @entity5 video camera near to a watering hole where they had hoped to film two wild dogs they had spotted in @entity14 during a trip in september talking about their experience filming the elephants , @entity7 added : ‘ we had seen two wild dogs at @entity14 ’s @entity62 on an early morning drive and decided that we would venture back there with the @entity5 to see if they appeared with the rest of the pack and the pups for an evening drink			1
‘ we set it up and arranged ourselves on the deck with the remote in hand			0
now we had established the distance we could safely operate between the camera and the remote			0
' on cue , elephants arrived and we started to film from our vantage point			2
while they were waiting for the dogs to show up , a group elephants approached the device one of the elephants even put the camera in his mouth before spitting it out and giving it a few thumps ‘ everything went very well until one large bull elephant came over and gingerly sniffed the camera and then gave it a prod with his foot			1
‘ that made the camera whip back and forth on the bendy stake like a @entity98 cobra ready to strike			0
‘ things settled down again and we thought everything was back to normal			0
until another young bull came over and investigated the camera			2
this time he kicked the stake hard enough to knock it over			0
‘ then he sniffed it seriously and picked it up in his trunk and put it in his mouth ! he quickly spat it out and gave it a few thumps with his foot and then moved on			0
@entity113 managed to retrieve his @entity5 camera when the elephants had turned their back on the device @entity7 works as a film - maker , creating promotional videos for @entity42			1
she lives in @entity43 with her husband @entity6 , a pilot and wildlife photographer ‘ @entity123 three came when a third elephant came past and looked at this weird contraption now lying apparently lifelessly on the ground , and he too gave it a cursory sniff and then with utter distain stomped on it			0
‘ actually , the footage shows what the underside of an elephants foot looks like if he were to stand on you ! after a few more stomps with his front foot , elephant number three lost interest and moved off			0
‘ of course retrieving the camera is always a great challenge , but this time the split second there was a gap @entity6 hotfooted it down in the vehicle to the site			2
at first he could n’t find the camera , but thankfully the white of the home - made conduit piping stuck out so he could identify it			0
‘ back at camp we downloaded the footage , which we are delighted with ! elephants do n’t think too much about foreign technology invading their watering hole – methinks ! ’			0
