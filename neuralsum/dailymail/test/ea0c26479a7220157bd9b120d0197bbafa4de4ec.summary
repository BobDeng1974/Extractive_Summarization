an @entity1 judge has blasted his junior colleague for ‘ taking his eye off the ball ’ and passing an ' unlawful ' sentence when letting a @entity8 manager dodge jail for a £ 28,000 expenses scam			1
wheelchair - bound @entity11 , 50 , was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in january after admitting his part in a two - and - a - half year con against his employer @entity8			1
@entity11 , along with fellow @entity18 manager @entity17 , invented clamped cars , overtime hours and damage to home owners ’ property during broadband installation , and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims			1
blasted : judge @entity27 ( left ) blasted his junior colleague @entity28 ( right ) for ' taking his eye off the ball ' when he sentenced @entity11 in january this year both @entity11 and @entity17 , 53 , who made £ 124,000 from the con , admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses			1
@entity17 was jailed for two years at january 's sentencing hearing , but mr recorder @entity28 spared @entity11 jail as an ‘ act of mercy ’ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a £ 1,500 fine			1
however , senior judge @entity27 has now said the sentence was ‘ unlawful ’ - and added @entity11 should have been sent to prison for his crimes			1
‘ it was an unlawful sentence passed and now i need to do something to put it right , because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter , ’ he said			2
‘ he was mercifully dealt with , sadly by a judge who did n’t have his eye on the ball			1
’ the judge told @entity49 , defending : ‘ the sentence was wrong but that ’s a matter of personal opinion			1
‘ your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison			0
‘ what the @entity55 did was to impose a package of sentencing options that was n’t available to him			0
‘ no one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on mr @entity11 was unlawful			1
‘ i am sorry to be the headmaster but we really do n’t want this sort of thing			0
’ fraud : wheelchair - bound @entity11 , 50 , was a manager with @entity8 who admitted defrauding the company of £ 28,000 over two years the @entity55 , who is the head of 4 @entity70 chambers and took the @entity71 in 2006 , gave @entity11 a 16 - month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine , and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue			1
but judge @entity74 said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order			2
turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing , he added : ‘ this is supposed to be a centre of excellence , when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and ca n’t do			2
‘ the judge should have been told what his powers were			2
’ prosecutor @entity90 said @entity11 offered a ‘ blank cheque ’ at sentencing and has already paid back the £ 28,000 he stole			2
after the judge heard the @entity94 will now drop the confiscation proceedings , he said the original sentence will stand , quipping : ‘ he no doubt thanks his lucky stars			1
’ both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time			0
the main fraudulent claim was for @entity8 vehicles which had been ‘ clamped ’ by parking authorities			0
@entity18 workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work			0
the company pays out around £ 1million in fines in @entity111 alone every year			0
@entity11 and @entity17 used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates			2
@entity115 , who has led a string of high - profile @entity119 prosecutions in the last two years , said : ‘ this was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time			0
‘ it involved over 100 or so false claims , made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity			0
‘ both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity			0
‘ you both knew how it could be conducted , concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally			0
’ @entity11 , of @entity137 , @entity138 , who had worked at @entity8 since 1988 , was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair			1
he was not at court today due to a mix - up over whether he was required to attend .			0

@entity11 was spared jail in an ' act of mercy ' by judge in january
but senior judge has now said his colleague took ' his eye off the ball '
@entity27 said wheelchair - bound @entity155 should have been jailed
but added @entity155 should thank his lucky stars as sentence allowed to stand
