by @entity0 pope @entity1 sacked the five - man board of the @entity3 who were associated with the discredited financial old guard pope @entity1 has sacked the five - man ' old boy network ' board of the @entity10 's financial watchdog , in the latest bid to break with the discredited old guard , which existed under his predecessor			1
the @entity10 said the pope chose four experts from @entity16 , @entity17 , the @entity18 and @entity19 to replace the five @entity19 on the board of the @entity3 ( @entity21 ) , the @entity10 's internal regulatory office			1
the new board includes a woman for the first time and has a broad range of international experience			1
all five outgoing members , who were laymen associated with the @entity10 's old guard , had expected to serve five - year terms until 2016			1
the new board includes @entity32 , who administers and advises philanthropic organisations in @entity16 , and @entity34 , a @entity35 law professor who is also a senior advisor at the @entity36 , a think - tank based in @entity38 the other two board members are @entity40 , former managing director of the @entity42 and senior advisor to the country 's president , and @entity46 , the head of two @entity19 insurance companies			1
the move comes as reformers inside the @entity51 pushed for the pope to appoint professionals with an international background			0
they wanted the professionals to work with @entity56 , a @entity16 lawyer who heads the @entity21 and has been pushing for change			0
@entity10 sources said @entity56 , @entity60 's former top anti-money laundering expert , also wanted @entity1 to appoint global professionals like him to help drive the authority forward			1
a @entity64 source said : ' @entity56 wanted a board he could work with and it seems the pope has come down on his side and sent the old boy network packing			0
' @entity1 , who was elected in march 2013 after the resignation of former @entity70 , has said the finances of the @entity10 need to be reformed for the @entity72 to have credibility			2
he set up a new @entity74 in february , which reports directly to him and appointed an outsider , @entity77 cardinal @entity76 , to head it			0
in another telling move , sir @entity1 removed cardinal @entity80 as president of the @entity21 in january , despite him having played a senior role in @entity51 finances for more than a decade			0

the @entity10 announced that four experts from @entity16 , @entity17 , the @entity18 and @entity19 - including one woman for the first time - would replace the five outgoing @entity19 , who had been due to serve on the board until 2016 since the arrival of @entity56 in 2012 , the @entity21 has been spearheading reforms to bring the @entity51 in line with international standards on financial transparency and money laundering			1
pope @entity1 has already taken steps to clear up @entity51 finances since he was appointed in march 2013 after the resignation of @entity70 , above but @entity10 sources say he has encountered resistance from an old , entrenched guard			2
a report last december by @entity108 , a monitoring committee of the @entity109 , said the @entity10 had made significant reforms but still had to show more oversight over its bank			2
pope @entity1 decided against closing the @entity91 but only on condition that reforms , including closing accounts by people not entitled to have them , continued			0
only @entity10 employees , religious institutions , orders of priests and nuns and catholic charities are allowed to have accounts at the bank			0
but investigators have found that a number were being used by outsiders , or that legitimate account holders were handling money for third parties			0
monsignor @entity131 , a former senior @entity10 accountant who had close ties to the @entity91 , is currently on trial accused of plotting to smuggle millions of dollars into @entity19 from @entity16 in a scheme to help rich friends avoid taxes			1
@entity131 has also been indicted on separate charges of laundering millions of euros through the @entity91			0
@entity139 and @entity140 , the @entity91 's director and deputy director , who resigned last july after @entity131 's arrest , have been ordered to stand trial on charges of violating anti-money laundering norms			0
