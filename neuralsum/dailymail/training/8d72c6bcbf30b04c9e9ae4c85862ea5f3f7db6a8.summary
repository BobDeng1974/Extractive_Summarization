eying a bargain : sir @entity1 sir @entity1 wants to buy 316 branches from @entity3 – but at a knockdown price thought to be around £ 1billion less than was previously on the table			1
the entrepreneur ’s @entity6 has had informal contact with @entity3 about a possible purchase after the deal to sell the branches to @entity12 collapsed on friday			1
sources said @entity6 , which tabled a bid in 2010 but lost out to the @entity16 bank , would be ‘ very interested if the price is right ’			1
it is thought the @entity20 company has a price tag of around £ 650million in mind , far less than the £ 1.65billion @entity12 had been willing to pay and only half the ‘ book value ’ @entity3 places on the business			1
@entity3 is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer after a £ 45billion bailout			1
yesterday consumer groups expressed fears that taxpayers could lose out if the branches , along with 1.8million personal and small business customers , are offloaded to @entity6			1
@entity33 , of the @entity34 , said : ‘ i would have concerns about this because the @entity38 taxpayer is already in for a substantial amount of money on @entity3 and we could come out of it with a big loss			2
‘ you ca n’t blame @entity1 for trying it on as he is an entrepreneur with an eye for opportunities			2
but i do n’t trust a system that allows entrepreneurs to feather their nest			2
‘ in government they do n’t seem capable of getting a good deal for the taxpayer			1
it would have to be watched very , very carefully			2
' if @entity20 is the only bidder , he will pare down the price to the bone			2
’ @entity6 took over the ‘ good bank ’ part of @entity60 in january in a deal that has lost the taxpayer between £ 175million and £ 289million , according to watchdog the @entity64			1
it now has 75 branches and 4million savings and mortgage customers			2
however , it has only 100,000 current account customers			2
money maker : sir @entity1 's @entity6 took over the ' good bank ' part of @entity60 - losing the taxpayer as much as £ 289million @entity3 was ordered by the @entity72 to sell the 316 branches as a condition of its taxpayer bailout			1
it signed a preliminary agreement with @entity12 in august 2010 and the deal was initially expected to complete by the end of last year			1
negotiations were called off last week by @entity12 chief executive @entity80 at a face - to - face meeting with her @entity3 opposite number @entity82			2
deal breaker : @entity12 pulled the plug on a deal to buy 316 @entity3 branches due to concerns over the bailed - out bank 's it systems she is thought to have told mr @entity82 that the delays , which are understood to have been caused by @entity3 ’s creaking computer systems , had dragged on too long			1
her decision leaves @entity3 casting about for a new buyer ahead of a deadline of the end of 2013			2
other possible buyers include @entity99 , which lost out this summer to the co-op in the race to take over 632 @entity103 branches			0
@entity3 could ask the @entity72 to let it keep the branches or extend the deadline			0
it is also considering floating the branches as a business on the stock market under the old @entity110 ’s name , or selling them to management			0
the mission by sir @entity1 , pictured right , to stamp his virgin branding on every aspect of life knows no limits			0
it is only days since he forced an embarrassing climbdown by the @entity120 in its decision to hand his @entity123 rail franchise to rival @entity124			0
far from resting on his laurels , the opportunistic tycoon is now preparing to pounce on 316 @entity3 branches			0
@entity1 loves to present himself as an iconoclast , a man of the people and a consumer champion in the stuffy world of business			1
he would have us believe his virgin money is a breath of fresh air bringing much - needed competition into @entity38 ’s jaded and corrupt banking sector			0
at least @entity1 is @entity38 , so it would not be yet another overseas takeover			0
but he is a billionaire carpetbagger			0
the thought of him squatting atop his labyrinthine business empire in his paradise island of @entity145 , plotting a predatory swoop on @entity3 , is deeply disquieting			1
no wonder he is eyeing the @entity3 branches			0
after all , the government has already allowed him to pull off one quite stunning coup with his purchase of the ‘ good ’ bit of @entity60			0
the @entity64 says that transaction lost the taxpayer anywhere between £ 175million and £ 289million			1
meanwhile , taxpayers are still on the hook for the ‘ bad ’ part of @entity60 , which depends on a £ 21billion state bailout			1
the government may feel a need to appease @entity1 after the rail debacle , but it should resist any temptation to hand him the @entity3 business			0
it is true that the @entity38 banking sector is in dire need of new competition , as the report commissioned by the government from sir @entity169 made abundantly clear			0
but @entity6 is still a relatively small operation with just 75 branches			1
with @entity60 , it acquired a savings and mortgages operation , not a full - scale high street bank			0
for it to take on the @entity3 branches would be like a sprat trying to swallow a whale			0
the evidence so far suggests that @entity6 would not necessarily offer consumer - friendly banking			1
the group climbed down on plans for a compulsory £ 60 a year fee on a current account it is designing under its own steam , but only after intervention by the @entity187			1
it is too early to predict whether @entity1 will succeed in an audacious attempt to sweep up the @entity3 branches			0
but those unfortunate customers have already endured the exploits of @entity192 and the it meltdown that paralysed millions of accounts earlier this year			0
surely they have suffered enough .			0

@entity196 's @entity6 thought to have £ 650million *budget* for bid
consumer groups express fears new deal could cost taxpayers a fortune
