by @entity0 with over 1.3billion people in the world living without electricity , suggesting a game of football seems the least likely solution to help the chronic problem			0
but two charitable entrepreneurs have seemingly come up with a way to guarantee power for those left in the darkness - an energy harnessing football			1
by kicking the @entity17 ball around , players can generate enough electricity in a 30 minute game to power a led lamp for three hours			2
the president kicked , headed and dribbled the ball around during an event at the @entity43 power plant to promote energy innovation in @entity25 , @entity45 , @entity38 reported			1
weighing 17 ounces â€” just one ounce more than a normal soccer ball - the ball contains a pendulum - like mechanism , which captures the kinetic energy generated during normal play , and stores it in the ball for later use as an off - grid power source			1
energy is stored in the @entity17 ball for later use as an off - grid power source lighting up lives : the balls could spell the end of unreliable power sources , the social enterprise says bright idea : the power kits mean that if children play with the ball through school , they can plug them in to light up their homework every day it is the creation of @entity70 - a for - profit social enterprise founded in may 2011 by @entity72 and @entity73			1
the pair , who met at @entity75 when they were studying to be social scientists , had no engineering expertise , but worked on the creation of the pioneering ball			2
the invention could mean an end to unpredictable power sources - and the termination of harmful power sources that are extremely damaging to users ' health			0
' households use kerosene lamps , diesel generators , and wood burning stoves , which are harmful to the environment and cause nearly 2 million deaths per year , ' @entity93 said			0
' living with fumes from one kerosene lamp is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes every day , ' it added			0
the enterprise says it has created power kits : ' consists of 1 @entity17 and 10 portable lamps			0
that way , children living in off - grid communities can play with a single @entity17 ball as a team at school and still have their own personal light for reading and homework at home			2

ball has a pendulum which stores kinetic energy and can be used later
president @entity22 dribbled the ball around in @entity45 today at energy event
