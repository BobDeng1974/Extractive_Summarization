by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor toppling @entity3 bears some responsibility for today 's crisis in @entity6 , @entity2 has admitted			2
mr @entity2 said it would be ' absurd ' to argue the 2003 @entity6 war had nothing to do with the chaos in the country today - as @entity12 inspired @entity14 fighters close in on @entity15			1
the former prime minister 's admission comes just days a week after he claimed the @entity19 - @entity19 invasion was not to blame for the looming civil war in the country			1
he said it was the ' predictable and malign effect ' of the crisis in @entity23			2
but he insisted that the primary cause was the failure to end the war in @entity23 but writing in the @entity31 today , mr @entity2 said : ' of course the @entity6 of 2014 bears , in part , the imprint of the removal of @entity3 11 years ago			1
to say otherwise , as a recent editorial in this newspaper implies that i do , would be absurd			0
' however , mr @entity2 insisted the main cause of today 's crisis in @entity6 is the civil war in @entity23 which the @entity42 has failed to stop			1
mr @entity2 's remarks came as the jihadist fighters in @entity6 captured two border posts over the weekend - one along the frontier with @entity47 and the other with @entity23 - considerably expanded territory under their control			2
the lightening offensive by the @entity14 takes the group closer to its dream of carving out an @entity14 state straddling both @entity23 and @entity6			1
mr @entity2 claimed that the @entity14 style terrorism had been all - but defeated seven years after the 2003 invasion but has been given new life by the @entity42 's failure to stop the sectarian strife ripping @entity23 apart			1
he said : ' we can not ignore the fact that @entity14 , the jihadist group advancing across @entity6 , rebuilt itself and organised the @entity6 operation from the chaos in @entity23			1
' @entity14 and other @entity12 - type groups in @entity6 were flat on their back four years ago , having been comprehensively beaten by a combination of @entity19 and @entity69 forces and @entity71 tribes			1
the civil war in @entity23 allowed them to get back on their feet			1
' the former @entity77 leader said not intervening in countries like @entity23 had been just as bad as going to war in @entity6			1
he said it would be ' odd ' to claim the @entity81 spring of 2011 would not have touched @entity6 forcing a civil war regardless of the decision to invade 11 years ago			1
@entity3 kept the country 's ethnic tensions in check with an iron fist , claim opponents of the @entity6 war			2
but he sparked a war with @entity90 killing one million people , invaded @entity92 and massacred thousands of @entity93 mr @entity2 claimed the ' fundamental challenge today ... is the challenge of @entity97 extremism ' around the world which needed to be taken on and defeated			0
he said the ' bad news is that this issue is not going away ' but claimed most @entity101 want nothing to do with dictators or terrorist - and should be supported to live in democracies			0
mr @entity2 has previously warned that by not intervening in @entity23 the problems are ' going to come back and they are going to hit us very directly even in our own country '			0
he added the ' biggest single worry today [ is ] returning jihadists fighters from @entity23 '			0
the former pm also called for @entity69 to ' support ' the @entity19 if they take military action in @entity6			2
' it 's in our interest to stop these jihadists			0
' ' they are prepared to fight us and they will if they are not stopped , ' he added			0
but mr @entity2 's intervention has been slammed by critics of his 2003 decision to take @entity69 to war against @entity6			2
sir @entity126 , @entity69 's ambassador to the @entity19 from 1997 to 2003 , said the decision to topple @entity3 was ' perhaps the most significant reason ' for the sectarian violence now ripping through @entity6			2
' there are many reasons for this disastrous state of affairs			0
perhaps the most significant is the decision taken more than 10 years ago by president @entity134 and prime minister @entity2 to unseat @entity3 without thinking through the consequences for @entity6 of the dictator 's removal			0
' the decision to bar members of @entity3 's @entity141 party from top jobs and disbanding the army - one former member of which now leads the @entity14 surge , were among the most serious errors , he said			0
' we are reaping what we sowed in 2003			0
we knew in the run - up to war that the overthrow of @entity3 would seriously destabilise @entity6 after 24 years of his iron rule			0
' for all his evil , he kept a lid on sectarian violence			0
@entity134 and @entity2 were repeatedly warned by their advisers and diplomats to make dispositions accordingly			0
' but , as we now know , very little was done until the last minute ; and what was done ... simply made things far worse			0
' @entity2 has vigorously defended his decision to support the then @entity19 president @entity134 's decision to invade and remove @entity3 in 2003 meanwhile , the @entity19 secretary of state @entity166 landed in @entity15 today on a surprise trip to push for @entity6 unity and stability			1
flying in from @entity47 on a visit which the @entity171 had sought to keep secret amid security concerns , mr @entity166 was to meet with beleaguered prime minister @entity174 and @entity6 leaders across the political and communal spectrum			1
mr @entity166 ' will discuss @entity19 actions under way to assist @entity6 as it confronts this threat from @entity14 and urge @entity6 leaders to move forward as quickly as possible with its government formation process to forge a government , ' @entity171 spokeswoman @entity178 said .			1

former @entity174 says it would be ' absurd ' to dismiss impact of 2003 invasion
insists failure to end @entity23 civil war is the principle cause of the @entity6 crisis
@entity195 inspired terror groups were ' on their back ' in 2010
latest intervention comes as @entity14 terrorists swallow more *chunks* of @entity6
@entity19 secretary of state @entity166 has arrived in @entity6 for crisis talks
