' u sound hot i wish i nva done that to u to late ' ( sic )			1
that 's the text message a remorseful @entity5 criminal sent to a @entity7 student after he broke into her car			1
and it was just the beginning of remarkable banter which culminated in the apologetic thief returning a swag of stolen goods - including handbags and identity cards - to @entity17 , 20 , and her four friends			1
@entity20 residents ms @entity17 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 visited @entity25 for a mutual friend 's 21st birthday on march 14			1

as the conversation continued , the crook began to reconsider			0
' u sound hot i wish i neva dne tht to u nw bt to late ' ' next tym take ya bags with ya ' : the criminal warned the girls not to leave their handbags unattended in a vehicle on future occasions the next day the ' very hungover ' students went sightseeing in town , leaving their handbags in plain sight inside ms @entity17 's car			1
when they returned they discovered the car 's locks had been picked and their possessions taken			0
they were preparing to make a police report when they realised ms @entity21 's @entity62 was among the stolen goods			1
' so i 'm like , " oh , why do n't we try texting them ? " nothing will probably happen , ' ms @entity17 said			2
ms @entity17 drafted a series of text messages aimed at the criminal			1
she did not rail over her stolen possessions , instead taking a different tack - telling the crook she hoped he enjoyed his new condoms and tampons			0
to her surprise , the robber replied			0
' ( he was ) so funny			0

they were overjoyed to find everything there hours late , with the exception of some of their money and @entity21 's stolen phone			1
' i guess once you put a face on the person you 've stolen off it 's hard to imagine that they 're not hurt from what you 've done , ' ms @entity17 said			2
' most people would n't be able to contact the people who took their stuff			0
' we just did n't imagine he would actually reply '			0
