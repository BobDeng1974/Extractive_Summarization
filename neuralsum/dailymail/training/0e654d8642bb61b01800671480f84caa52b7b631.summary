@entity0 arrives at @entity1 , @entity2 , where he was sentenced for sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust today a teacher was caught having an affair with a pupil when the girl ’s mother found him hiding under her bed			1
@entity0 , who was 35 at the time , climbed into a drawer in the 16 - year - old ’s single divan bed after her mother returned home early			1
but the mother became suspicious when she saw that her daughter ’s hair and make - up were out of place			2
she went into the bedroom , noticed ‘ movement ’ in the drawer and ordered him to get out from under the bed			2
yesterday , @entity0 , who is married , was sentenced to 14 months in prison , suspended for two years , after admitting six counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust			1
@entity2 @entity1 heard there had been sexual activity between the maths teacher and the @entity39 pupil six times between may and july last year			2
it happened at her house , at the home he shared with his wife and son , now three , and in his car in a @entity50 ’s car park			2
the pair had ‘ full sex ’ once at the girl ’s home the day before they were discovered			1
@entity56 sent the girl dozens of explicit texts , including one that said : ‘ have you heard about today ’s maths lesson ? i ’m going to figure out if 35 goes into 16			1
’ in others he called her a ‘ minx ’ and said she was ‘ talented in bed ’			1
@entity66 , prosecuting , said @entity56 , who turned 36 yesterday , was not teaching the girl at the time of the offences			1
she had been meeting him in school for advice about depression for about three months before he invited her to his house to look at his art and they kissed , the court heard			2
mr @entity66 said the affair was discovered on july 19 when the girl ’s mother pushed open her daughter ’s bedroom door and saw a man ’s suit jacket and a pair of man ’s shoes			0
she then saw that a sheet was folded back and could see movement in the divan drawer and material inside that matched the suit jacket			0
when she demanded to know who was there , her daughter replied , ‘ mr @entity0			1
’ mr @entity66 added : ‘ the mother ordered the defendant to get out from under the bed and she recognised him immediately as her daughter ’s maths teacher from the school			0
’ the mother called the school and police and @entity0 was arrested later that day			1
he told police that the sex was consensual , the girl was 16 and he did not believe she was a pupil at the time because she had finished her gcse exams			1
the court heard @entity56 bombarded the youngster with obscene text messages before having sex with her @entity56 tried to get the charges relating to the abuse of a position of trust thrown out for the same reason , but changed his plea to guilty when his application was rejected			1
mr @entity66 said the girl now ‘ worries about whispers and gossip ’ but is otherwise ‘ coping very well ’ , but her mother ‘ feels betrayed ’			0
@entity125 , defending , said @entity56 , a @entity127 graduate , was a man of ‘ extremely good character ’ with a seven - year ‘ unblemished history ’ at the school , where he was assistant head of @entity132			1
she said his wife , a gp , described him as a ‘ fundamentally good person ’ and had decided to stand by him , but the affair had been ‘ utterly mortifying ’ for her			0
@entity56 is banned from teaching for life and now works as a window salesman , she said			2
miss @entity125 added : ‘ he ’s lost his standing in the community , he ’s lost his good character and he ’s lost the career he loved			0
‘ quite what possessed him to embark on this course of conduct is really unclear			0
he was flattered by the attention that this young woman gave him			0
it seems that he became utterly carried away with himself			0
@entity56 avoided jail after @entity150 ( pictured ) heard the offences have ruined his career ‘ he now is going to bear the cost for that because effectively he has ruined his life			1
it is going to take many years for this man to piece his life back together again			0
’ judge @entity159 told @entity56 that the girl was ‘ impressionable ’ and he could not attribute the affair to a ‘ moment of madness ’ because it went on for ‘ a good number of weeks ’			1
he added : ‘ you bear responsibility for what happened			0
you are nearly 20 years older than this girl			0
‘ you allowed yourself to indulge in this behaviour and this activity in this relationship			0
you allowed yourself to get carried away			0
’ as well as the suspended prison sentence , @entity56 , from @entity172 , @entity173 , was ordered to do 200 hours of community service and pay £ 500 prosecution costs			2
he was also put on the sex offenders register for ten years .			0
