the legends whom @entity1 would emulate met in the paddock for a brief chat — the tartan hat of sir @entity7 peak to peak with the equally trademark red cap of @entity9			1
the decades have not dimmed a bond begotten by each man ’s achievement in winning the @entity16 world drivers ’ title three times			1
only seven others could ever make that claim : @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			2
here in sunlit @entity27 , @entity1 began practice for the @entity30 @entity29 at the start of a 20 - round season in which the @entity33 driver hopes to add his name to that exclusive club			1
@entity1 will be hoping to retain the @entity16 title after last season 's triumph @entity1 took part in friday 's @entity42 practice session ahead of sunday 's season opener @entity25 , pictured in 2006 , is the most successful @entity16 driver with seven world titles the first race of the 2015 @entity16 schedule begins in @entity27 , @entity30 on sunday drivers ’ champion @entity1			1
a great driver in a great car			2
his one and only threat is @entity53 , poised and calculating coolly for any mistake			2
constructors ’ champion put your weekly shopping budget , your mortgage and @entity61 ’s school fees on @entity62			2
surprise driver @entity65 ’s @entity64 , 17 and 166 days tomorrow			2
my second choice : @entity69 of @entity70			2
the race i am most looking forward to ? the saying in @entity16 is those that start with ‘ m ’ are the best to be at : @entity27 ( my absolute favourite ) , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
@entity1 pondered the word ‘ legend ’ and said : ‘ i hope when i have retired and am much , much older , perhaps in 30 years , a kid might use that phrase for me			1
‘ i want to win this year			2
there ’s a championship there for the taking			2
damn it , i want to win it ! i want to go and grab it			2
at least as much as last year , and hopefully even more			2
’ he will certainly have a car capable of accomplishing that task			2
mercedes are in a parallel universe of speed and reliability , according to pre-season testing			0
it again promises to be a straight fight between him and his team - mate @entity53			0
@entity9 is their boss at @entity62			0
@entity7 has been a critic of @entity1 from time to time			1
he thinks the word ‘ legend ’ can only be applied long after a driver has hung up his helmet			0
‘ that is how it works with many halls of fame in @entity108 , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity109 waits to confer its judgment			0
’ the debate about @entity1 is always keen			1
he fuels this by his actions			0
he has taken to posting pictures of himself brooding and pouting , half - dressed and self - absorbed on the photo - based website @entity118			0
one such picture had @entity1 standing in a graffiti - lined alley in @entity27 looking up to the sky with his hands clasped in prayer			1
these fine exhibits of modern art are being undertaken by @entity127 , a bald and bearded music producer who seems newly to have attached himself to @entity128			0
he is walking around the paddock with a camera in his hand			0
never mind that , it is @entity1 ’s heavy and skilled right foot that will define him over the next eight - and - a - half months			1
but his compatriot @entity134 believes there is still room for @entity1 to improve on his championship - winning form of last season			1
@entity1 celebrated in @entity140 after winning the 2014 @entity16 @entity62 team showed their support for @entity143 by wearing merchandise on friday @entity62 ' drivers @entity1 ( left ) and @entity53 both also wore t - shirts in support of @entity143 ‘ he was most inconsistent last year , ’ said @entity134 , whose @entity148 was three seconds slower than @entity62 in practice			1
‘ in racing , @entity1 was stronger than ever			1
in qualifying , he seemed weaker than ever			0
it was a different @entity1			1
this year , with more confidence , he ’ll be more consistent in qualifying and a stronger driver			0
’ @entity53 ’s qualities should not be enough to stop an on - form , all - firing @entity1 becoming the first @entity158 to win consecutive titles , but the @entity160 is calm and focused on his retaliative challenge			1
‘ @entity1 was a little bit stronger than me last year , ’ admitted @entity53 , who is due to become a father in august			1
‘ he ’s been working on himself during the winter and i have been working on myself			0
‘ i ’m not at my peak @entity16 performance yet			1
being an @entity16 driver is multi-faceted			1
it ’s not just about turning the steering wheel in the best possible way			0
it ’s outside the car , too , having your whole life around you sorted so you are focused and have the energy to do the perfect job in the car			0
coming second has motivated me for this year			0
’ @entity1 wants to remembered as a ' legend ' after he has retired from @entity16 the 30 - year - old takes time out in the garage during the first practice session of the new season @entity185 's former @entity184 driver @entity183 has abandoned his legal action against the team the season starts with @entity16 in a curious , but entirely new , state of disrepair			1
@entity190 , the team that rose from the bones of @entity193 , look unlikely to race because , among other things , they do not have the software required to run their cars			0
it seems the hard drives were wiped to prepare them to be auctioned when the team ’s assets were due to be sold and they now need to reinstall the missing programs			0
but the biggest drama was at @entity185 , where @entity184 driver @entity183 is suing the team for breaking his contract			0
a court in @entity27 has ruled in his favour , saying he should race			1
however , he can not do so because he has not been granted a super-licence			0
he still put on overalls yesterday and was fitted for his seat , unavailingly			0
@entity185 sat out the first practice session but took part in the second in the form of their two named drivers @entity219 and @entity220			2
the squabbling parties called a truce of sorts this morning @entity27 time , with @entity224 der @entity183 abandoning his legal action and averting , for now at least , the threat of bailiffs seizing the team ’s assets			1
@entity230 ‘ @entity1 appears to be going through a transition in his off - track life			1
i see he is negotiating his own contract , doing music in the future and has split up with @entity237 ( @entity238 ) , and all of these things have an influence on your life which may be a positive or negative			0
' it will be interesting to see now he is a wealthy champion and got lots of opportunities whether the absolute focus is still on the job			0
@entity53 now has the experience of battling for a world championship			0
he went into last year with a good car , everything was going great , then he had the collision in @entity255 , his team told him he was a bad boy and he was getting booed			0
i think he will be stronger			0
’ @entity256 ‘ @entity53 has talents that are slightly more subtle and less obvious than @entity1 but i think he is going to have to invent a new @entity53 to counter his team - mate			1
the championship was delivered by @entity1 , so if @entity62 have to hedge one way or the other , they will go for @entity1			1
' i ca n’t see @entity1 getting distracted			1
he can see the prizes , he collects his trophies and is very proud of his success and he still talks as if he is stunned by his own success			0
he will be difficult to beat this year			0
’ @entity265 ‘ if @entity1 had finished his career with one championship it would have been a travesty but if he wins a third he becomes one of the all - time greats			1
' he has got to win consecutive championships which is always perceived to be particularly difficult , but he is going to have a dominant car again so it is @entity53 who he has got to race			2
unless @entity53 has found a way to raise his game , what is going to put @entity1 under pressure apart from himself ? ’ @entity280 ‘ i do n’t think it ’s a given for @entity1			1
he ca n’t say “ i beat him last year and it ’s going to be fine , i will be able to do those runs of winning four races on the trot again and everything will be hunky dory ” — it wo n’t be like that			0
@entity1 will think , “ yes , i ’m quicker ”			1
is @entity53 capable of doing it ? i think he is , that ’s why i say @entity1 can not rest on his laurels because he will be there for sure			2

@entity1 will be hoping to win his third @entity16 title
only seven other drivers have ever won more than two *f1* titles
@entity1 is *gearing* up for sunday 's season opener in @entity27
