photographer @entity0 has been behind the camera at almost 1,400 weddings , but there is one he will never forget - the one where he met his future wife			1
the only snag was she was the bride			0
the 44 - year - old , from @entity9 , south of @entity10 , first met @entity11 , 28 , in 2009 when he sat down with her and her husband - to - be for a consultation before their nuptials the following year			1
during the build up to the ceremony , mr @entity0 said he got on well with both parties , insisting there were no sparks when they first met			2
@entity0 and @entity22 first met in 2009 when @entity11 was getting married to her first husband with their dog , @entity26 , in tow the @entity9 couple tied the knot five years after they first met ' i actually thought @entity0 was gay at first because when we went into the consultation , there was a lot of pink and a lot of fluffy dogs and then he introduced his partner , @entity38 , ' mrs @entity22 told @entity39			1
@entity38 was mr @entity0 's then - business partner			1
mr @entity0 said he treated @entity11 the same way he treated all his clients			1
' when we first met we got along – i get along with all my customers – i ’m a people person , ' he said			0
' i helped @entity11 a lot with the planning			2
then after the wedding , we used to talk a lot and we had a real connection			0
' mrs @entity22 - then @entity11 - came in for a wedding photo consulation the couple tied the knot on june 7 at @entity54 in @entity55 they stayed in touch after @entity11 tied the knot with @entity59 - a chef whose full name they were reluctant to disclose			1
' that 's old news , ' mr @entity0 said , diplomatically			2
' towards the end of that relationship , we got a lot closer			0
' ' but i was married about 10 years ago and i know when [ a marriage breaks up ] sometimes you need a bit of space			2
' the couple are adamant nothing happened between them until april 2012 , after @entity11 's marriage to @entity59 had ended			1
mr and mrs @entity22 shared their first kiss the day after @entity79 and married on june 7 this year at @entity54 in the @entity80			1
' i messaged him and said i wanted to come over and watch movies , ' mrs @entity22 said of their hook - up two years ago			2
' he said he was sick and i said : " that ’s ok , i ’ll take a hint " because i did n't think he liked me			0
' but then he said " come over " , and he really was sick			0
' then we had our first kiss , i was really shy about it			0
' the @entity89 chose to have their wedding - with their pet dog , @entity26 , in tow - in the @entity80 ( right ) because of the spectacular scenery mr and mrs @entity22 said they were now inseparable - working at the photography studio and living together fresh from their honeymoon , the couple said they could n't believe how much media attention their story had attracted			1
' it ’s just crazy the way things happen – it ’s just like @entity105 [ the movie ] , ' @entity11 said			0
' if i had never got married , i would have never met @entity0			1
' everybody laughs at our story and think it ’s sweet			0
' but we do n’t even think about it anymore – it ’s just normal for us			0
