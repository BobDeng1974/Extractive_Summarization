by @entity0 @entity2 scientists have developed a pen that enables them to create new bone tissues			0
when bones are broken in accidents or following amputations , the tissue inside them is also damaged , making it difficult to build new , fully functioning implants			0
to solve this problem , a team of @entity2 researchers have created a handheld 3d printer called the @entity16 which not only adds layers of tissue cells to damaged bones , but combines with existing nerves and muscles			1
it works in a similar way to a 3d printer by building layers of cells and alginate , or seaweed extract , before covering them in a protective gel the device works in a similar way to a 3d printer by building layers of material			1
it mixes cells with alginate , or seaweed extract , before covering them in a protective gel			2
the two layers of the material are mixed together in the tip of the @entity16 and surgeons can use the mixture to ‘ draw ’ or ‘ fill in ’ damaged sections of bones			1
as the mixture is drawn onto the bones , an ultraviolet light dries it so the surgeon can create layers of cells , or as the researchers call it , ‘ bone scaffolding			1
’ the cells will then multiply , and eventually join the cells of tissue , including nerves or muscles			2
it means surgeons can design customised implants during surgery , rather than waiting weeks to grow replacement tissue			0
the @entity16 technology could additionally cut recovery times and increase the chances of surgery success because the cells combine with the patient ’s existing tissue to prevent rejection			2
the device can also be used with other drugs to increase regrowth and recovery			0
the @entity16 prototype was designed and built at the @entity26 and was recently given to clinical partners at @entity85			0

@entity121 ’s will work on optimising the cell material for clinical projects due to be carried out at the proposed @entity124 in @entity85 next year			0
the team at @entity26 previously grew new knee cartilage from stem cells on 3d - printed scaffolds that could be used to treat cancers and osteoarthritis			0
according to the researchers , the @entity16 will ‘ give surgeons greater control over where the materials are deposited while also reducing the time the patient is in surgery by delivering live cells and growth factors directly to the site of injury , accelerating the regeneration of functional bone and cartilage			1
