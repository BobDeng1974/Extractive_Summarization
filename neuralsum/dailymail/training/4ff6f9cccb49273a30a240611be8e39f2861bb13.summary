scandal creator @entity0 has a policy of not having real - life political figures make guest appearances on her @entity4 based political thriller			1
but the powerhouse producer told @entity7 news last week that she would be willing to make an exception for philandering president @entity10			2
' that 's not really our thing , but i will say , " @entity10 , if you 're out there , we would love to have you … we would always love to have you , " ' she said			1
@entity18 : scandal creator @entity0 says she 'd love to have former president @entity10 make a cameo on the show like @entity22 's fictitious president , @entity21 , played by @entity23 , @entity10 was publicly shamed during his presidency for knocking boots with a @entity27 staffer			1
after infamously claiming he never had sexual relations with @entity27 intern @entity30 in january of 1998 , @entity10 , who was then in the second year of his second term , admitted in an august 1998 televeised address that he did in fact have an improper sexual relationship with @entity30			0
@entity0 ' twisted political drama , which is gearing up for its fourth season , is not a dramatization of @entity10 's time in office , however			1
@entity21 is a @entity39 , and the show is very loosely based on the administration of @entity39 president @entity42 , who held office for one term from 1988 - 1992			0
the character played by actress @entity46 , former @entity27 communications aide and presidential mistress @entity47 , was inspired by former @entity42 administration aide @entity49 , who now runs a high - end crisis communications shop in @entity4 @entity49 also serves as a co-producer on @entity22			0
real - life fixer @entity49 ( left ) and her on - camera counterpart @entity46 ( right ) pictured here at @entity54 's @entity56 event presented by @entity57 in october 2013 , where @entity4 had just won an award for her portrayal of @entity47 on scandal at a scandal - themed @entity65 breakfast held in concert with the @entity68 in early may , @entity42 's former transportation secretary , @entity63 , said that @entity49 called up her former boss to forewarn him about the racy content of the show and he teased her about the on - air affair and said he was ' honored ' to be the inspiration for @entity22 's hunky president			1
president @entity42 and @entity49 were not romantically involved like their on air counterparts but the sex - filled side plot between @entity47 and the @entity79 in scandal makes for a juicer storyline			0
neither the @entity42 administration nor the @entity10 administration made a habit of killing anyone who stood it its way , either , a common remedy for political problems that arise in scandal			0
' there are always interesting politicians out there who would be interesting [ to have on the show ] , but our show is a very heightened , very dark view of @entity4 , ' @entity0 told @entity7 news			2
' i do n't think really @entity10 or any of those people belong in our @entity4			1
' not everything that occurs in scandal is completely out of the realm of possibility , however			0
when the press learns of the president 's affair with @entity47 , paparazzi show up at the fixer 's door and bombard her with questions about her intimate relationship with the commander in chief			0
@entity30 was pestered by the press in a similar manner after she was outed as @entity10 's former mistress			2
ironically , it was @entity49 who represented @entity30 during @entity10 's impeachment proceedings , which would make an on - set rendezvous between the former president and @entity49 all the more titillating			1
it 's unlikely that @entity10 would want to draw new attention to his sex life by appearing on the show , but much stranger things have happened in politics			0
the former president has n't made any cameos in the past , however , @entity10 is known to be a fan of the show and may fancy an opportunity to meet the cast and crew .			2

@entity0 wants former president @entity10 to make a cameo on her hit @entity137 show , scandal
' that 's not really our thing , but i will say , " @entity10 , if you 're out there , we would love to have you … we would always love to have you , " ' she said in a *recent* interview
@entity0 said she has *avoided* political cameos in the past because @entity22 is so ' dark ' and *unrealistic*
' i do n't think really @entity10 or any of those people belong in our @entity4 '
both the president in @entity22 and @entity10 *engaged* in sexual *misconduct* while in office , but scandal is not based on @entity10 's presidency
