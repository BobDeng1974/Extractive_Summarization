@entity2 wing @entity0 will return to @entity3 ’s starting xv in @entity4 on sunday at the expense of @entity6			1
may was released back to @entity7 on tuesday night , paying the price for a glaring lapse against @entity10 at @entity11 when he failed to capitalise on a three - on - one overlap			1
@entity0 has been operating at outside centre for @entity2 and was in electric form as the @entity15 swept to victory at @entity17 last weekend			2
he was a fixture in the senior team during last year ’s @entity20 and scored a maiden @entity22 try against @entity10 in @entity23			0
but that was his last appearance as injuries checked his progress			0
he damaged a shoulder and , during the enforced break , had surgery on a knee problem			0
@entity2 wing @entity0 will return to @entity3 ’s starting xv against @entity33 in @entity4 on sunday @entity35 's @entity3 squad warm - up at their training base at @entity37 on tuesday the @entity3 forward pack hit the scrum machine as forwards coach @entity40 watches on @entity40 brings his pack into a huddle for a team talk as they squad continue their preparations for @entity4 @entity3 have started to use the choke tackle more often with flanker @entity47 leading from the front @entity0 , 21 , is likely to be part of a back - three unit showing two changes as @entity52 is on standby to take over from @entity53 if , as feared , the @entity17 full - back fails to recover from concussion in time			1
@entity56 of @entity57 is another full - back in a trimmed - down squad of 26 but he is there merely to gain experience			1
@entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 have all returned to training after injuries but have been sent back to their clubs to play in the @entity69			1
with @entity73 tighthead prop @entity72 nursing a hip strain , @entity71 ’s @entity70 is poised to take over as a replacement			0
head coach @entity35 said : ‘ preparation has gone well			1
we ’ve had to make some tough decisions but it ’s a good position to be in			0
those players going back to their clubs have another big weekend ahead to lay down a marker for later in the tournament			2
’ @entity40 pinpointed hooker @entity82 and lock @entity83 as key ' chokers ' in the @entity86 team the choke tackle involves a defender wrapping his arms around the neck and chest of the ball - carrier — often one who is isolated and too upright — and preventing him from going to ground			1
with assistance from team - mates , this can lead to the ball being stripped or a maul forming , which can produce a penalty to the defending team if the opposition collapse it in their bid retrieve the ball			0
if a maul forms and the ball does n’t emerge , the defending team will win the put - in at the subsequent scrum			0
meanwhile @entity3 plan to use @entity33 ’s favourite weapon — the choke tackle — against their rivals on sunday			1
while the @entity113 long ago mastered the art of holding up isolated runners to win turnovers and penalties , now @entity3 have acquired the knack , led by the recalled @entity120 captain in their back row , @entity47			1
the order from @entity123 and his assistants will be to carry on choking , but not to overplay it			0
‘ it ’s a powerful tool if a team can do it well — stand you up there and quickly get mass under the body , ’ said forwards coach @entity40			1
‘ we ’ve done it more of late			0
we ’ve got a couple of personnel in our team now who are good at it and maybe were n’t in our team six to 10 months ago			0
but it ’s been around for six years			0
you ’ve got to employ it at the right time			0
we encourage our guys that they can choke , but they have to do it appropriately , at the right time			2
if you do it wrong you just get danced back for five metres , it goes into a ruck and you ’ve lost territory			2
but if you get it right , it ’s a hell of a tactic			2
’ @entity0 is choke tackled by @entity152 ( left ) and @entity153 at @entity11 last season best puts in a crunching hit on @entity159 scrum half @entity157 during his side 's victory against @entity159 @entity162 ( centre ) worked with @entity40 during the 2009 and 2013 @entity165 tours @entity40 initially refused to identify the leading @entity167 exponents of the ploy but eventually mentioned @entity47 , adding : ‘ it ’s not limited to him			1
@entity171 won a crucial penalty at the end of the @entity175 game with the same tactic			1
’ @entity40 pointed to three key @entity86 chokers — two of whom are available to face @entity3			1
‘ for @entity33 , @entity82 , @entity180 and @entity181 are all good at it , ’ he said , before paying tribute to the young @entity3 lock who will go toe to toe with @entity181 : @entity186 of @entity187			1
injuries to @entity62 and @entity189 left the coaches with a problem but @entity186 has been the solution , first in the autumn and lately in victories over @entity175 and @entity10			1
he is making a powerful case for a @entity196 place			0
@entity186 has been outstanding for @entity3 following injuries to @entity62 and @entity189 @entity186 , 25 , revealed that when @entity181 was leading the @entity198 in @entity199 six years ago he was cheering from the stands as a teenage prospect on a playing stint in @entity203			1
asked if he ever imagined that one day he would find himself up against @entity181 , @entity186 said : ‘ it was a very distant dream			0
i was rather underweight and not the best rugby player			0
i weighed less than our backs coach			2
’ a notable victory was secured by campaigners in the @entity210 on tuesday that will curb online ticket touting ahead of the @entity196 and the @entity213 series this summer			2
proposals for a provision in the @entity216 — to ensure that tickets traded online include block , row and seat number plus the face value — had previously been rejected by the @entity222			0
but the persistence of the @entity210 , backed by cricket ’s @entity224 and rugby ’s @entity227 ruling bodies , led to the government ’s capitulation on the issue yesterday			2
the new regulations will be in place in time for the start of the @entity213 series in july .			0

@entity6 was released back to @entity7 on tuesday night
