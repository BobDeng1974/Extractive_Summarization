by @entity0 published : 12:19 est , 14 march 2012 updated : 12:29 est , 14 march 2012 @entity2 premier @entity1 today warned that the country needs to embrace democracy and make urgent political reforms			1
mr @entity1 said that the changes are needed to prevent @entity2 's economy from faltering and to spread wealth more evenly			1
he vowed to use his last year in power to attack mounting discontent that he warned could end in chaos - and may even see a new @entity12			1
call for change : @entity2 premier @entity1 today warned that the country needs to embrace democracy and make urgent political reforms the reference was to the tumultuous period between 1966 and 1976 when chairman @entity17 persecuted members of his own @entity19 in a desperate bid to reimpose his iron rule			1
in a three - hour news conference , his sole such event of the year , mr @entity1 said : ' a historical tragedy like the @entity12 could occur again			1
each party member and cadre should feel a sense of urgency			2
' mr @entity1 renewed a call for unspecified political reforms , particularly of the @entity19 leadership , saying that without them @entity2 's hard - won prosperity might fizzle			1
the @entity12 , also known by its full title of the @entity12 , took place in @entity2 between 1966 and 1976			1
it was set in motion by chairman @entity17 ( pictured ) of the @entity19 in may 1966 to combat what he saw as corrosive @entity40 influences			0
this was done by removing cultural , capitalist and traditional elements from @entity2 society			1
the revolution saw @entity17 regain his iron rule , but affected the country both economically and socially			0
' revisionists ' suspected of trying to filter @entity40 elements into @entity2 society were removed through violence			1
it is estimated that up to 1.5million people were killed during the struggle , although a true figure will never be known			0
roughly the same number suffered permanent injuries			0
the tumultuous period ended following @entity17 's death in 1976			0
he said : ' reform has reached a critical stage			0
without the success of political reform , economic reforms can not be carried out			0
the results that we have achieved may be lost			0
' no democratic firebrand , mr @entity1 has issued similarly vague pleas before - and become a popular if lone voice among senior leaders by doing so			1
this time his tone was more emphatic , as was the setting			0
the news conference was his last scheduled briefing before the prim 69 - year - old steps down in a year after a decade in office			2
he said he is ' seized by a strong sense of responsibility ' to speak out and referred repeatedly to the judgement of history			0
the recurring references to the past and the wistful , reflective tone turned the premier 's news conference into something of a swan song for the most popular member of the usually remote leadership			0
sometimes called ' @entity1 ' , he comes across as warm and caring			1
he has been shown eating dumplings with coal miners and consoling survivors of the devastating @entity93 earthquake and other disasters			0
as the number three in the party leadership who is primarily responsible for the economy , mr @entity1 fielded a range of questions , from local government debt to currency reform			1
he offered @entity2 funding of @entity106 infrastructure projects to create @entity106 jobs and rebalance lopsided economic ties with a crucial trading partner			2
he sidestepped a question asking his views of the democratic uprisings in parts of the @entity115 world			0
mr @entity1 sounded resolute on government efforts to deflate a property bubble , saying ' home prices in @entity2 are far from coming back to a reasonable level '			1
the @entity121 and @entity122 stock markets swooned , bucking the trend in markets elsewhere buoyed by strong @entity126 gains			0
sometimes called ' @entity1 ' , the premier comes across as warm and caring			2
he made his comments during a three - hour news conference in @entity130 mr @entity1 , president @entity131 and most of the leadership are stepping down to hew to unwritten rules of succession and make way for younger leaders			2
the turnover always invites divisive infighting that the party prefers to keep under wraps			0
he retires next year along with president @entity131 after a decade in power which has seen @entity2 grow to become the world 's second - biggest economy , but which is likely to see 2012 deliver the slowest rate of annual growth during their leadership			1
a reflective mr @entity1 said : ' due to my incompetent abilities and institutional and other factors , there is still much room for improvement in my work			2
' i should assume responsibility for the problems that have occurred in @entity2 's economy and society during my term in office for which i feel truly sorry			2

@entity1 vows to use his last year in power to attack mounting discontent he says could end in chaos
he warns @entity2 could see a new @entity12
