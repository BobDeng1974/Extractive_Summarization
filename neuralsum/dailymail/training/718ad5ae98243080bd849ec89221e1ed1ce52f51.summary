an early morning wake - up call prank went horribly wrong for a couple of bumbling @entity2 anchors when they had phoned a total stranger			2
@entity5 and @entity6 , the co-hosts of @entity2 ’s new morning show early start orchestrated the prank to pull on comedian @entity10 in @entity11 , where it was 3:40am			1
but it was n’t @entity10			1
it was someone else who was speaking @entity16 and was extremely confused by the call			1
when the bumbling pair reached @entity10 , pictured , he revealed he had been watching @entity2 all along and saw the prank fall flat ' @entity10 this is the @entity30 calling , ' she said , before erupting in a fit of chuckles			1
but her laughter was cut short as she finally realized they were not speaking with the comedian			2
ms @entity5 asked : ' is this @entity10 ? ' but got only silence			1
@entity38 in the face , she got up from her chair , saying : ' know what , @entity6 , you 're taking this one '			0
ms @entity6 tried to smooth things over			0
she said : ' disculpe ! we did n't mean to call you so early in the morning			2
we apologise , whoever you are			0
' ms @entity5 eventually returned to her seat in a state of disbelief			0
' i totally do n’t believe we just got a wrong number			0
poor guy has no idea he was just on @entity2 '			0
she also tried to explain away the error saying mr @entity10 must have given them a bogus number because ' he does @entity57 , ' where they ’re ' hateful '			1
the anchors tried again with a different number and finally reached the funnyman , who had been up and watched their prank fall flat			0
who is this ? ms @entity5 's laughter was cut short as she realized they were n't talking to @entity10 at all , but to a @entity16 - speaking stranger who had no idea he was on @entity2 right , i 'm off : an embarrassed @entity5 briefly got up from her chair , saying : ' know what , @entity6 , you 're taking this one ' he said : ' i 'm already up and i actually happened to flip you guys on and you woke up some poor @entity76 guy '			1
early start premiered on @entity2 just a week ago , replacing the news network 's @entity77			0
