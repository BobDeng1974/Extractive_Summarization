the red pigments in some of @entity2 's most valuable paintings are fading , according to new research			1
the @entity6 impressionist 's work is famed for its rustic beauty and bold colours , but some of the pigments are now at risk of disappearing entirely			1
scientists studying the colour blue irises in one of @entity2 's later paintings have found that the flowers were actually once purple			1
dr @entity28 , head of conservation at the @entity30 in @entity31 , made the discovery as part of research during restoration work on some of the 200 of @entity2 's paintings held at the museum			1
@entity39 pigments are manufactured by precipitating a dye , usually by using a metallic salt to bind it			0
red lake pigments became particularly popular during the @entity43 , allowing artists to produce vibrant colours of rich fabrics and draperies that became fashionable			1
red lake pigments could also be translucent , meaning they were often used in layers of glaze over more opaque red , in order to create a deep , rich red colour			1
however , many lake pigments came from organic materials such as plants , and so tend to be unstable when exposed to light			0
the work lake comes from the word lac , which refers to a resinous secretion that occurs as the pigment is produced			2
lighting levels at the museum have now been reduced by half in an attempt to slow the deterioration of the paint			1
speaking to the @entity6 public broadcaster @entity69 , she said : ' these blue irises were once purple			0
' this is the result of the deterioration of red lake pigments by light			1
' dr @entity76 , who is also a lecturer at the @entity77 , was conducting her research in a joint project with scientists at the @entity81 , the @entity30 and the @entity82			2
they mapped the decay of colour in @entity86 with irises at @entity21 , which he completed in 1888			0
it is thought to be the first of a series of paintings of irises that he completed while at an asylum in @entity21			0
another of these , known simply as @entity96 , is listed among the most expensive paintings ever sold and is thought to be now worth more than £ 70.6 million			0
their work raises the prospect that many of @entity2 's other paintings , such as his famous still life of @entity104 , are also at risk			1
@entity2 struggled to sell his paintings during his life and wrestled with mental illness that led to him cutting off his own ear and later shot himself at the age of 37			2
it was only after his death that the importance of his work began to be truely recognised and his works are now among the most expensive paintings ever sold			0
in 1993 his painting @entity117 sold for £ 36 million			0
descriptions by @entity2 of the colour of his lodgings that he painted in the bedroom show that the floor and walls actually contained more red pigment , giving them more vivid shades than they have today experts used computer reconstructions to boost the red in @entity2 's paintings to see how they would have originally looked before they faded under the bright lights that has caused the red pigment to degrade the first hints that @entity2 's paintings were fading came during the restoration of another of his artworks , the bedroom			1
in a series of letters to his brother and sister , @entity2 described in detail the vivid colours of his room			1
this allowed scientists to reconstruct how the painting would have originally looked			0
they found that the pale brown floor should have been a richer purple and peach colour while the blue walls were originally an orange - red and violet			2
writing about the restoration work conducted on @entity2 's @entity155 , @entity156 , a curator at the @entity30 , said : ' the most intriguing issue , of course , is discolouration			1
' now that we know the purplish - peachy colour of the floor and the blue of the walls were originally more like orange - red and violet , respectively , we would love to figure out how the work originally looked			0
' though i doubt we will ever be able to reconstruct the original colour scheme exactly , in the future we will look at other works for which @entity2 ’s letters mention one colour , violet , for instance , while we now see another , such as blue			2
' to begin with , there are the other versions of the bedroom , but we could also look at @entity2 ’s oil copies of black - and - white prints , which he called ‘ translations in colour ’			2
for instance @entity182 - covered field with a harrow			0
' the researchers hope to examine other works by @entity2 , such as his famous @entity104 still lifes , that may have contained red lake pigment to see if their colour has changed over time after years on display @entity2 's paintings , such as this painting of @entity193 with @entity194 , and @entity195 , rarely come up for sale but this still life sold for more than £ 39.3 million when it sold at an auction at @entity201 in @entity202 last month dr @entity28 and her team are now using computer software to build up a picture of how the paintings originally looked			1
for now , however , they will not be attempting to restore the original colour to the paintings			0
instead curators at the @entity30 have lowered the level of ambient light and introduced dark backgrounds to help reduce reflected light to help extend the life of the paintings			2
@entity218 , head of the collection at the @entity30 , said : depending on the amount of hours that you exhibit a painting , it may be that you have reached the limit after 20 years , or you can display it less to stretch to 30 years			0
' with measures such as ambient , dark backs and bringing the light back to about half of what it was several years ago , we can solve much			0

experts at the @entity30 in @entity31 compared the colour in impressionist 's paintings with descriptions he gave in *personal* letters
they found that in many of the paintings the colours are fading away
red lake pigment used by @entity2 found to be particularly *problem*
@entity30 has halved lighting levels to help *preserve* paintings
