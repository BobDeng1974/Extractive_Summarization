by @entity0 , political reporter published : 18:47 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 01:37 est , 12 august 2013 mothers who stay at home to look after their children have criticised plans to allow working families earning up to £ 300,000 to enjoy tax - free childcare			1
the scheme , which would be available to up to 2.5million families where both parents work , would let them claim back 20 per cent of childcare costs			1
but the 1.2million parents who stay home will not get a penny			1
ministers claim that restricting the scheme to those in a lower tax band would exclude middle - earner families and would raise administrative costs			2
stay at home : 1.2million parents will miss out on help with childcare costs			1
campaigners said the proposals ignored the cost and work required to stay at home and raise children but @entity32 , of the campaign group @entity33 , said this argument ignored the ‘ cost and dedication involved in raising children ’			1
mrs @entity32 , a barrister who gave up work to look after her two children , attacked the government ’s focus on helping families where both parents work			2
such families have been offered up to £ 1,200 per child under five , but mrs @entity32 said this discriminates against traditional families who have only one income			0
she was backed by @entity51 leader @entity50 , who said yesterday that the government ’s policy was ‘ nonsensical ’			0
he accused ministers of behaving as if ‘ the real economic enemy is n’t the failure to cut red tape and empower small - and medium - sized businesses , but seems to be the concept of the traditional family where one parent ... goes out to work while the other brings up the children			2
’ @entity64 said last week that he had ‘ huge respect ’ for parents who stayed at home , but was accused of being ‘ patronising ’ when he said they had made a ‘ lifestyle choice ’			1
' patronising ' : @entity64 said raising children at home is a lifestyle choice '			1
campaigners said the proposal discriminates against traditional families who have only one income mrs @entity32 said the figure of £ 300,000 per family , which is under consultation , is a ‘ grossly unfair measure in austerity @entity80 ’			0
‘ @entity64 defended the limit on administrative and cost grounds , saying that to set it at the lower tax band would exclude middle - earner families , ’ she said			2
‘ the chancellor was disingenuous in his explanation , as even a limit of £ 40,000 would result in families earning up to £ 80,000 benefiting from the scheme			0
this is well above the cut - off for child benefit , which was set at £ 60,000			0
‘ these limits reek of political point scoring			0
mr @entity64 clearly does n’t want to exclude his party ’s key voters from benefiting from his proposals			0
’ @entity99 , chairman of @entity33 , said subsidised childcare should go to those on around the average income of £ 26,500 , not ‘ ten times that amount ’ .			0

proposed scheme would let working parents claim back 20per cent of childcare costs
@entity64 said stay - at - home parents make a ' lifestyle choice '
outraged parents say the plan ignores the cost and work needed to stay at home with children
