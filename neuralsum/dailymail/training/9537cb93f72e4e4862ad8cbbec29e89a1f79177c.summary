business minister @entity0 said @entity1 would noy be able to ' entirely ' control @entity3 migration as long as it stayed in the @entity4 we will never be able to control our borders so long as @entity1 remains in the @entity4 , a @entity8 minister warned last night			1
in an explosive interview , skills minister @entity0 said the free movement of people is a fundamental principle of the @entity4 that @entity1 has to accept			1
as long as the @entity1 remains a successful economy , @entity1 need to get used to a ‘ very large amount of immigration every year ’			0
mr @entity0 ’s words blow a hole in @entity19 ’s argument that he can claw back any meaningful powers from @entity21 over @entity1 borders			1
they will also be seized on by @entity24 and @entity25 as proof that his talks with @entity21 will achieve little			0
@entity29 chancellor @entity28 has already said she would not agree to any ‘ tampering ’ with @entity4 migration rules			2
in an interview with @entity33 , mr @entity0 insisted the @entity1 people would favour a reasonable level of immigration if they thought @entity37 had control			1
but he admitted that those who believed @entity40 did not have such control were ‘ right ’			0
‘ i will always make the argument that we should , for cultural , economic , justice and equality reasons , always have a reasonable level of immigration , ’ he said			0
‘ it will always be the position the @entity1 people would arrive at if they feel they have control over immigration			2
you can win that argument but only if people know that they , through their @entity37 , are in control			0
‘ the difficulty that has arisen is this sense that we do n’t have that control – and , bluntly , they ’re right			0
’ he added : ‘ we may never be able to control it entirely , because it ’s a fundamental principle of the @entity4 , but it will be very hard for the @entity1 people to accept that			1
’ last night mr @entity0 clarified his statements , saying : ‘ i do not believe and did not say that we can not seek changes to the way immigration works within the @entity4			2
quite the contrary , i think it is essential that we do so			0
’ meanwhile , it emerged the @entity8 bill to enshrine in law mr @entity19 ’s promised referendum in 2017 on whether @entity1 should stay in the @entity4 will not be voted on in the @entity74 – due to a row with his @entity77 partners			1
@entity8 mp @entity78 , who was taking the bill through @entity37 , accused @entity77 leader @entity79 of ‘ killing off our chances ’ of putting it into law			0
@entity19 gave a statement to the @entity74 yesterday on the latest @entity4 fallout over its demand for an extra £ 1.7billion from @entity1 national insurance numbers ( @entity85 ) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the @entity4 , up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed @entity89 , @entity88 , @entity90 and @entity91 have seen the biggest increases in @entity85 in the last six years , according to official government figures @entity24 leader @entity94 ( left ) with the @entity96 president @entity95 , has dismissed the prime minister 's chances of reforming @entity4 freedom of movement rules			1

@entity0 said @entity1 would ' never be able to control ' immigration entirely
he said freedom of movement was a ' fundamental principle of the @entity4 '
remarks blow a hole in @entity19 's pledge *overhaul* @entity4 migration
