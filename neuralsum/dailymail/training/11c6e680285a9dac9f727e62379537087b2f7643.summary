a mother has been left furious after being forced to home school her four - year - old daughter who was was rejected from nine schools in her local area			1
@entity5 should have started term last september but now faces an uncertain future because no school in her catchment area has enough space to take her			1
her mother @entity11 , 26 , had set her sights on @entity14 ’s @entity13 , the same primary school her other two daughters @entity16 , ten , and @entity17 , eight , go to			1
@entity11 , 26 , has been forced to home school her four - year - old daughter @entity19 after nine schools said they did not have enough room for the toddler to attend however , after being told there was no room , the single mum was forced to look elsewhere			1
the search has continued without success for the past eight months			0
@entity28 , who does n’t drive , said @entity29 told her the nearest school that will take her daughter is six miles away in @entity34			1
but as the mum - of - three has to walk her other children the two miles to their school she is being forced to home school @entity19 as it is ' physically impossible to be in two places at once			1
' yesterday miss @entity5 , from @entity41 , in @entity42 , fumed : ' it is ridiculous , i am now facing the option that my daughter might not go to any school			1
' she is going to nursery for three mornings a week but she is the oldest there as she is nearly five and the nursery is saying they ca n’t cater for her much longer			0
' now i just want her in any school i can physically get to			1
i have appealed all nine schools ’ decisions but it is looking unlikely			2
' it would have been nice for her to be with her sisters as i do n’t want them split up but that does n’t seem like an option			2
@entity19 was supposed to start school last september and was hoping to attend a nearby primary with her two sisters , but was turned down for a place ( file pic ) ' i was working at @entity64 before i had children and i just want any job now			1
' if i ca n’t get @entity19 into school i wo n’t be able to get a job and the government will make me go on @entity70			2
' i do n’t want to claim benefits , i want to work			0
it is not my fault there are not enough school places			2
' we are already walking four miles a day and if we do get the bus a family ticket is £ 9			2
to get to @entity34 as well would mean spending nearly £ 20 a day just on bus fares			0
' all i want is for @entity19 to be in school and get an education			0
' i have started looking to see if we can move because i think that will have to be the last resort			0
' @entity85 , head teacher at @entity14 ’s , in the @entity41 area of @entity42 said they faced a difficult task at having to turn down places for children			0
she said : ' we are popular because we get results and are rated ‘ outstanding ’ by @entity92			0
it is difficult but we have to turn down some parents			0
' councillor @entity95 , portfolio holder for children ’s services for @entity29 , has pledged that a place will be found at every school			1
he said : ' we are working very hard to offer every child a place as quickly as possible			0
