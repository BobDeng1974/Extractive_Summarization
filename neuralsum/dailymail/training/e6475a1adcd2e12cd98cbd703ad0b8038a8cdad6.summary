former @entity7 leader @entity38 last night warned the party is committing ‘ political suicide ’ by questioning mr @entity2 ’s leadership			1
@entity38 , putting on a bizarre @entity43 accent , quoted his newsagent as having said to him of the plotters : ‘ what are all these crazy people doing to our party ? ’ he told @entity49 that the threat to mr @entity2 ’s leadership was ‘ not substantial ’ but was causing ‘ a degree of damage ’			1
‘ as far as i can see , their tendency is towards political suicide , ’ he said			1
‘ there ’s no real substance in what they are saying			0
and the claims that they ’re making , so far as you can identify them , are totally unjustifiable			0
' because after four years , @entity2 is a leader of proven courage , high intelligence , he ’s got a great quality of leadership , of great leadership , which is being resilient , calm and defiant			0
’ @entity38 admitted mr @entity2 was portrayed as ‘ remote , cerebral , weird if you like ’ but this was ‘ in total contrast with the man he really is ’			2
ex-leader @entity38 warned ousting mr @entity2 would be ' suicide ' but shadow cabinet minister @entity77 admitted some of her colleagues have ' jitters ' about the leadership if mr @entity2 's brother @entity83 returned to the @entity84 and became @entity7 leader , the @entity5 poll suggested the party would have a six - point lead over the @entity35			1
but neither shadow home secretary @entity89 nor her husband , shadow chancellor @entity90 , would do anything to improve @entity7 's prospects as leader , it found			2
of all voters , only 7 per cent of voters think mr @entity2 has been a strong leader , with 59 per cent viewing him as weak			2
a separate poll , by @entity97 for @entity98 , showed that if mr @entity2 were replaced by mr @entity29 or suave business spokesman @entity100 , @entity7 's four - point lead over the @entity35 would double			1
that extra support could gain @entity7 an extra 50 seats , pollsters say			2
when asked to choose between mr @entity2 , mr @entity100 , miss @entity89 , mr @entity90 or mr @entity29 in 15 categories , mr @entity2 came last in eight of them			1
mr @entity29 won six categories and mr @entity100 five			2
today mr @entity100 leapt to his leader 's defence , insisting general election victory in may was still possible			0
@entity110 business secretary @entity100 insisted election victory was within touching distance for @entity7 he told @entity113 's today programme : ' you get noises every now and then , but on the whole , these are anonymous and off - the - record			1
' if you speak to the overwhelming majority of our mps , of our supporters , people recognise this is going to be a tough for election but are absolutely up for it			0
@entity127 ' f we look at our progress , during this parliament , there 's been a lot of talk about polls			0
those go up and down , but under @entity2 's leadership we are now in touching distance of a general election victory			0
' shadow energy secretary @entity77 insisted those calling for mr @entity2 to quit were ' a few ' against the ' many ' who want him to stay			1
she told @entity143 's @entity142 : ' these things happen , they are a few voices against the many in our party who are very focused on winning the election under his leadership			0
' i think @entity2 is very focused on what we need to do to win			0
he focuses on what he has to do for the @entity156 people			0
' mr @entity2 's critics in the @entity7 were urged to put up or shut up yesterday in a high risk attempt to end the plotting against him			1
@entity160 , the @entity162 's new general election enforcer , ordered plotters to ' show us your colours ' or move on , as it emerged one in five of mr @entity2 's frontbench team is ready to call on him to go			0
the @entity7 leadership has sought to play down the threat to mr @entity2 , publicly blaming the media for fuelling attacks on him in retaliation for his calls for press regulation			2
but after a terrible party conference speech , in which he forgot the deficit , a series of botched photo opportunities and the erosion of @entity7 's poll lead over the @entity35 , behind the scenes there is a growing sense of dismay about the prospect of mr @entity2 leading the party to defeat			1
ms @entity160 , who mr @entity2 made vice-chairman of the general election campaign in the reshuffle earlier this week , issued a direct challenge to his opponents in the @entity7 ranks to end the anonymous briefings			2
she told @entity196 's politics on @entity49 5 live : ' well what i would say to those people is be careful what you wish for because if your analysis is right , that there are people that are concerned about @entity2 but yet do n't want a leadership contest then what they are doing in briefing anonymously and , in my view , cowardly briefing newspapers , they are bringing about the worst of all worlds			0
they need to decide what their plan is and get on with it either way			0
' she added : ' either show us your colours and put names to quotes or let 's just move on and have a different conversation			0
