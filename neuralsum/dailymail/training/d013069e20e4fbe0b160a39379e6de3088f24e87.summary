the fish ladder by @entity1 when @entity1 was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer in her mid- 40s , she told the radiographer : ‘ i have a ten ‑ year - old daughter			1
’ @entity1 tells of her emotional journey to reconnect with her family ( picture posed by model ) the doctor asked if there was a history of breast cancer in her family , but @entity1 did n’t know			1
attempts to trace her biological mother had failed and her father was merely a dash on a birth certificate			1
though she was raised by wonderful adoptive parents , she had always felt ‘ dizzyingly adrift ’			1
this uncertainty about her own origins drives her to seek out more tangible sources : those of rivers around the @entity28			2
in this crisp , poetic little book , @entity1 describes her walks beside rivers , including the @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
she first began these walks to ward off the depression she felt looming after a late miscarriage , not many months before the cancer diagnosis			1
she had suffered from mental illness before			2
while working as a successful tv script editor , she had awoken from an unexplained blackout to find herself coughing blood down a sink , while her husband ( novelist @entity43 ) sobbed in the shower beside her , with his head in his hands			2
she had a feeling she had been screaming , but no memory of what or why			2
another time she made herself a cup of tea and walked to her bedroom window			2
as she pulled the curtains , she found five other cups lined up along the sill , each in various stages of cooling			2
@entity1 knew she could not go back into that dark place			1
she had to stay sane and strong for daughter @entity60 , who had longed for a brother			0
so she began to walk			0
@entity62 keeps her mother company on some of these adventures , but @entity66 ’s most extraordinary journeys are taken alone			0
a scary man is spotted hurling rocks into the sea			0
she is too afraid of him to pass , and so makes the bizarre decision to curl up and sleep in the sand dunes until he has gone			0
when she awakes , he is there and she retreats to her car , only to find somebody has let her tyres down			0
although her birth mother has made no effort to contact her , @entity1 finds her living near the source of the @entity33			1
she walks past this woman ’s house and fantasises about a reunion of flowers and chocolates			1
she imagines receiving a letter confessing : ‘ i love you			0
there has not been one day when i have not thought of you			0
’ instead she receives a cold rebuff : a nasty note explaining she was the result of a ‘ quickie ’ at a party in @entity97 and had been delivered under general anaesthetic so that her mother never even saw her and wants to hear no more about the ‘ horrible ’ matter			0
the rejection makes it easier for @entity1 to ignore her wishes and she traces her half ( or possibly full ) brothers , @entity106 and @entity107 , in @entity108			1
online she finds a rugby team photograph and in it a ‘ smiling man , who had my daughter ’s eyes ’			0
they go along to a match and @entity1 realises how much an uncle might mean to little @entity118			1
a few days after the match , @entity62 is holding a bundle : ‘ soft and fluffy , and smelling of milk and fabric softener			0
as mother and daughter drive home , they pass the village where @entity1 ’s birth mother lives			1
coming out of the slick , wet darkness of a storm , they count seven rainbows in the sky ahead .			0

@entity1 was diagnosed with breast cancer in her mid- 40s
in an attempt to ward off depression , the @entity139 took to walking
she was adopted as a child and had failed to trace her birth family
it was during these riverside walks she tried yet again to make contact
