by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter there are more than 300 of them in @entity5 - violent crews of dozens of 12 - to 20 - year - olds with names such as very crispy gangsters , @entity9 and @entity10			1
police say these groups , clustered around a particular block or housing project , are responsible for about 40 percent of the city 's shootings , with most of that violence stemming from the smallest of disses on the street , @entity20 , @entity21 or @entity22			1
' it 's like belonging to an evil fraternity , ' said inspector @entity25 , commander of the @entity27 's gang division			0
' a lot of it is driven by nothing : a dispute over a girl or a wrong look or a perceived slight			0
while the @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity65 still exist , operating such money - making schemes as drug dealing , their members are usually older and understand the timeworn mantra of organized crime : violence is bad for business			1
not so for the crews , whose recklessness prompted former police commissioner @entity75 in 2012 to launch an initiative to confront the crews dubbed @entity78			0
investigators now focus on gathering intelligence about specific crews - understanding their activities , allegiances and feuds which they glean through traditional street policing and trolling of social media sites , cell phone photos and even recorded jailhouse calls			1
police have also stepped up arrests of the most active crew members			0
in @entity94 , prosecutors set up an internal email alert system that notifies them when crew member are arrested , even on minor charges , and provides beyond - the - rap - sheet details for bail arguments			0
the prosecutor might mention that the person was a suspect in another crime or had made threats on @entity20 , for instance			0
in a recent case in @entity108 , @entity94 , district attorney @entity106 says a 2009 killing kindled years of vendetta attacks , including three killings and 30 shootings			0
@entity113 , a former convict turned businessman , now runs a programme for gang members in schools @entity113 believes that mos of the shootings happened because ' disrespect ' show by one gang member to another ( pictured : pistols on display in @entity5 after police arrest six men for arms smuggling ) sixty - three people were rounded up , and at least 62 entered guilty pleas , including crew members so young that one told another to " mob up " after school			1
' the evidence was very powerful , ' said @entity136 , who represented a 19 - year - old who pleaded guilty to attempted murder and conspiracy charges in the case last week			1
' they had such access to social media and they knew who the players were			1
' @entity27 statistics show gang arrests are up citywide nearly 14 percent from 2013 - and more than 28 percent from two years ago			2
shooting incidents citywide are about the same as they were last year , with 282 recorded so far , and are down by nearly 23 percent from two years ago			0
still , crew - related violence persists despite record dips in overall crime in @entity5 over the last few years			1
the most notable recent case came in march when investigators say a 14 - year - old member of the @entity156 shot a .357 revolver at a rival member of the @entity159 on a crowded bus in @entity161			1
the bullet instead killed an immigrant father who was working two jobs to support his family			0
' when you ask young adults , " why ? why did you shoot that young man ? " probably 80 percent of the time the answer is : he disrespected me , ' said @entity113 , an ex-con - turned - businessman who runs a gang - diversion program in city high schools			2
@entity113 works with students who have been arrested at least once , forcing them to define what disrespect means through exercises and role - playing			2
in the 1800s , before prohibition and the mafia , gangs were still rife in the city			2
the likes of the @entity187 and the @entity188 ran the streets , lead by the likes of @entity192 and @entity193 this gangland violence was encapsulated in @entity196 's 2002 film gangs of @entity5 , starring @entity197 as @entity192 , who was an actual gangster in the 1800s @entity198 , 18 , a high school junior , says he 's been affiliated with crews and gangs since he was 9 , though he 's trying to turn his life around			1
' a crew to me is a family , ' he said			0
' they are going to be there for me like my parents was never there for me			0
' as more crew members are locked up , investigators are noticing a trend of crew members shifting affiliations behind bars , emerging as a sort - of hybrid gang - crew combination with diffuse connections and alliances			2
' that has really complicated this universe , ' @entity217 said			0
' we went from a traditional gang problem to a crew problem and now we 're morphing back into somewhat of a traditional gang problem ' gang culture has existed in @entity5 for hundreds of years , from the modern - day crews , back to the dominance of the @entity183 during the 1920s and prohibition , and even back to the 1800s when the likes of the @entity187 and @entity188 roamed the streets			1
these criminals were captured in @entity196 's 2002 film gangs of @entity5 , a part - historical film that was based on the histories of this criminal underworld			1
the film 's anti-hero , @entity192 , was a genuine gangster in the city in the 19th - century , named @entity240 , and contested his territory with the likes of ' @entity244 ' @entity243 and @entity193 .			2

there are thought to be more than 300 gangs currently in @entity5
while likes of @entity44 and @entity45 still exist , majority are smaller crews
around 40 per cent of shootings are carried out by these small groups
crews like very crispy gangsters made up of dozens 12 to 20 - year - olds
violence occurs over ' disrespect ' shown on streets on on social media
@entity5 has long gang culture *stretching* back to the 1800s
gangsters of this era capture in @entity196 film gangs of @entity5
