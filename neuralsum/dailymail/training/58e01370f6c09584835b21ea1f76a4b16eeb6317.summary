by @entity0 curiosity has sent back the first pictures of the @entity4 rock dust it collected after successfully drilling down into the surface of the @entity4			1
images released today by @entity8 's @entity7 in @entity9 , @entity10 , show for the first time that powdered rock sample has been transferred to an open scoop			1
@entity8 says it is the very first time anyone has drilled into a rock beyond our home planet and collected a sample from its interior			1
the image was taken on @entity1 's 193rd @entity4 day of operations the @entity32 space agency 's @entity30 is using the curiosity rover to investigate whether an area within @entity4 ' @entity34 was ever hospitable to microbial life			2
they hope to now use @entity1 's on - board scientific instruments to analyse the pulverised rock sample in an effort to learn more about the site 's environmental history			1
curiosity drilling engineer @entity42 said : ' seeing the powder from the drill in the scoop allows us to verify for the first time the drill collected a sample as it bore into the rock			2
' many of us have been working toward this day for years			0
getting final confirmation of successful drilling is incredibly gratifying			0
' for the sampling team , this is the equivalent of the landing team going crazy after the successful touchdown			0
' sample preparation : the 150 - micrometer sieve which will be used to remove larger particles from samples before delivery to science instruments how it works : these schematic drawings show a top view and a cutaway view of a section of the drill on @entity8 's @entity1 on @entity4 , showing how dust is drawn up through the instrument for collection the drill on @entity1 's robotic arm collected the powder as it bored a 2.5in hole into flat @entity4 bedrock on february 8			1
researcher will now instruct @entity1 to sieve the sample and deliver portions to its analytical instruments			2
the scoop holding the precious sample is part of @entity86 ( @entity88 ) device			0
the next step is to enclose the power inside @entity88 and shake it over a sieve to screen out any particles which are larger than 0.006in ( 150 microns ) across			0
holy holes on @entity4 ! @entity8 's rover curiosity drilled a 2.5in - hole hole on february 8 to take its @entity4 planet sample - next to it is a shallower hole where the rover conducted its test drilling small portions of the sieved sample later will then be delivered through inlet ports on top of the rover deck into the @entity106 ( @entity107 ) instrument and @entity108 at @entity4 ( @entity110 ) instrument			1
the sample comes from a fine - grained , veiny sedimentary rock called " @entity114 , " named in memory of a @entity117 deputy project manager who died in 2011			0
the rock was selected for the first sample drilling because it may hold evidence of wet environmental conditions long ago .			0

new images show the sample inside an open scoop in the @entity4 rover
samples will now be sieved and sent to scientific instruments
@entity8 says it is the first rock sample taken from another planet
it hopes to find out whether @entity4 environment could have harboured life
