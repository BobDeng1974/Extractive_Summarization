how to stop @entity0 ? it is a question that has confounded most teams facing @entity3 for the last 10 years			1
and in this tournament @entity0 has at last weaved his mesmerising magic for @entity6 on a consistent basis			1
@entity9 boss @entity8 is a precise type of coach in his preparation and may consider the idea of man - marking @entity0 given the @entity9 side ’s preferred 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 formation			1
former @entity18 player @entity17 could be utilised in such a role			1
main man : @entity0 controls the ball during an @entity6 training session ahead of tuesday 's game perfect 10 : @entity0 has scored four goals for @entity26 in this @entity27 so far @entity28 : @entity0 - highlights but former @entity30 @entity27 winner @entity29 who suffered a chastening experience when he first came up against @entity0 on his @entity33 debut after leaving @entity34 thinks that would be a wrong tactical move			1
' it would be a huge mistake to man mark @entity0 , ' said @entity29			1
' he can just beat his marker or move and make openings for others			2
the only thing you can really do is give less space like @entity46 did			0
they played by getting close and being aggressive but late they got tired and dropped off him a little			0
that ’s all he needed to score			0
' of that first meeting when @entity0 was just 18 , @entity29 added : ‘ i tried to kick him … i tried to scare him but every time you fouled him he put the ball down on the floor , took a free kick and was off again looking for the ball			2
hard task : @entity17 ( centre ) could be charged with stopping @entity0 in the last - 16 tie ' he always shows real bravery and courage and plays for the team ' there is something about left - footed players			1
the best of them wield their left leg like a magic wand and the right foot is often just there to balance on			0
@entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 were all masters and now of course there is @entity0			2
all four of his goals at this @entity27 have been scored with his left foot			2
mind you , so far 54 goals - 36 per cent – of all goals in @entity85 have been scored with the left peg			2
so far @entity87 have lived up to their billing as the clever - money dark - horse tip. the @entity92 though have shown the energy and attacking menace to put @entity96 ’ side to their test			0
and in football there is always a tipping moment when a run comes to an end			0
in the 20 games that keeper @entity105 has played for @entity87 they have never lost			0
is now the time ? by the way , although @entity106 want to extend his loan , @entity109 are set to take him back after the finals and make him their no 1			0
the @entity92 love dubbing their sports stars with sobriquets			0
so surely @entity116 , their 26 - year - old midfielder son of former @entity92 coach @entity117 and who plays for @entity118 , should be called @entity119			0
in their first three group games he covered 23.6 miles @entity122 squeezed through against @entity123 as @entity85 did with @entity124			0
marathon man : @entity116 ( right ) has run huge distances to help @entity92 into the knockout stages now it is @entity129 against @entity85 in the quarter - final and @entity122 vs @entity30 , which could mean a @entity85 vs @entity122 semi-final			1
a @entity27 classic in the making ? incredibly these two @entity27 super-powers have only met once in its 84 year history - the 2002 final in @entity136 , which @entity85 won 2 - 0 @entity137 despite some of the bad baggage that has come with this @entity27 - bribery allegations about @entity141 , betting rumours surrounding @entity143 , match fixing claims surrounding @entity145 and , of course , @entity147 - on the pitch it has continued to be enthralling and dramatic continuing into the knockout stage			1
even if some of the games have been tighter and more gruelling this is heading for the best finals in terms of the football since 1970			0
let ’s hope it continues and the enduring image of this tournament is the buena vistas of @entity85 ’s beaches and @entity163 on the pitch @entity165 both tuesday ’s games look to be tight , so a draw double at 90 minutes could be on the cards			2
@entity6 and @entity169 is 3 - 1 for the draw , while it ’s 21 - 10 with @entity87 and @entity92			1
but if you are feeling adventurous then @entity172 to score and @entity92 to win is 7 - 1			0
@entity0 to score first and @entity6 to win is 7 - 2			1
one to watch @entity9 front man @entity173 hit the 50th hat trick in @entity27 history when the @entity9 beat @entity176 3 - 0			1
he is the player who gives the robust hard working @entity9 side a cutting edge			0
the @entity180 striker , who is wanted by @entity181 , can upset the @entity0 roadshow			2
@entity183 of the two @entity184 in @entity185 @entity186 : @entity169 midfielder @entity173 could be the one player who @entity6 fear @entity27 moment @entity189 vs @entity122 ’s quarter - final prompts memories of the semi-final clash between the two countries in 1982			1
it was an incredible match in @entity194 , which ended 3 - 3 with @entity122 winning on penalties , the first time a @entity27 semi-final had been settled that way but it is best remembered for the horror clash in which @entity122 keeper @entity200 brutally took out @entity30 striker @entity201			1
it should have been a penalty and a red card - perhaps more , given how badly @entity201 was bashed up - but @entity200 got off @entity204 .			0

@entity6 take on @entity169 in @entity27 last - 16 clash on tuesday
@entity0 has been star of the tournament for @entity6
@entity8 could use @entity17 as man - marker against @entity0
@entity30 legend @entity212 advises @entity169 against that tactic
