angry : captain @entity0 , who was off - duty but helped co-ordinate the evacuation , said @entity2 was a ' disgraceful man ' an off - duty captain who co-ordinated the @entity5 's evacuation has condemned the ship 's skipper as a ' disgraceful ' man			1
captain @entity0 , 45 , this afternoon broke his silence over claims @entity11 abandoned ship before passengers and failed to make a mayday call as the ship listed			1
he said : ' only a disgraceful man would have left all those passengers on board			0
it was the most horrible experience of my life			1
a tragedy , a heartache that i will carry with me forever			1
' off - duty @entity0 , who captains the @entity5 's sister ship the @entity25 , was only on board the ship by chance as he made his way back home to @entity31 , near @entity32			1
@entity0 , who is engaged and lives in @entity33 on the @entity36 - @entity35 border , was in his cabin resting when disaster struck			1
he helped dozens of woman and children into lifeboats , and is understood to have organised the entire rescue effort throughout the night			1
survivors have also said that as the keen biker left his cabin he told every passenger he met to put on a life jacket			0
he added : ' we managed to avoid the worse and have the world crash down around us			0
i just want to rest and forget			0
' do n’t call me a hero			0
i just did my duty , the duty of a sea captain – actually the duty of a normal man			2
' @entity55 and the others with me just did our duty			0
we looked each other in the eyes for a second and then we just got on with it			0
' @entity0 's comments came after one @entity2 's former captains labelled him ' a braggart , a show - off ' and claimed he drove the luxury liner ' like a @entity66 '			1
captain @entity67 also revealed he had to put @entity11 in his place ' more than once ' when the under - fire commander acted as his deputy on the now doomed vessel , @entity69 reported			1
his claims came as @entity35 divers again suspended their search of the capsized ship at 8am after it shifted slightly on its resting place near the @entity79 island of @entity80			1
fire services spokesman @entity81 said the shift of a few centimetres posed a potential threat to diving teams operating in the submerged spaces of the ship			0
it increased fears the vessel could soon dislodge from the rock and plummet 100m down to the bottom of the @entity93			1
' @entity94 and a show - off ' : the @entity5 's captain @entity2 , pictured ( left ) in his pomp in 2010 and leaving court ( right ) yesterday , has been heavily criticised by a former captain of the stricken luxury cruise liner slipping : the @entity5 fell another few centimetres into the sea today , sparking fears it will soon dislodge itself from its rocky resting place and plummet 100m to the bottom of the sea @entity2 , 52 , a captain since 2006 , now faces a possible 15 years in prison for multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship while dozens of passengers were still aboard			1
yesterday the death toll rose to 11 when divers located five more bodies , all of them adults wearing life jackets , in the rear of the ship near an emergency evacuation point			1
a total of 24 people are still missing			2
trawling : police scuba divers scour the ship for survivors and bodies , using explosives to blast debris and other obstacles out of their path race against the clock : the hulking vessel could slip and plunge to the sea bed at any minute the tongue lashing given to @entity2 by an angry coastguard has been turned into a £ 12 t - shirt			1
the shirt , bearing the phrase ' @entity11 , @entity139 ' - went on sale within minutes of the recording of the coastguard 's row with captain @entity11 was made public			2
widely read as ' get on board , damn it ' , @entity35 translators say the phrase is really far more forceful than that			2
one said : ' in one way it can mean ' f * * * ing get on board ' and in another way it means ' get on board , you p * * * k '			0
' prosecutors have alleged @entity2 was trying to show off by sailing past the @entity79 island of @entity80 , where his head waiter lived , when he ran the ship aground just 150m offshore			1
the ship should have been at least five miles out to sea , but struck rocks @entity2 claimed were ' not on his chart '			2
the liner then continued for several hundred metres before running aground further along the coast			0
@entity2 , who started his career on a ferry boat near his home on @entity172 's @entity168 but has now been stripped of his command , has now been ordered by an investigating magistrate to undergo a drug test			2
searching off the liner was due to continue today , before its suspension , with further explosive charges detonated around the superstructure			0
the aim is to make it easier for navy and coastguard diving teams to reach sections of the @entity5 that still need to be searched			0
attention was due to be focused mainly on the restaurant on deck four at the back of the @entity5			0
that was the location where the bodies of four men and a woman all aged between 50 and 60 years old were found yesterday , and where it is feared the rest of the missing passengers and crew are			0
the search teams are racing against time as the weather is set to turn stormy tomorrow , with waves of up to two metres forecast as well as storm force winds			0
brave team : the divers are working under the danger that furniture or debris could slip and crush them if the boat lists human chain : rescue workers climb on to the @entity5 in the faint hope that some passengers may be clinging to life in a freak air pocket the fear is that a large sea swell could easily ' lift ' the liner from the rock ledge it is resting on and send it plunging 100m to the bottom of the sea			1
salvage teams are also expected to begin pumping off 2,280 tons of heavy duty diesel that is still in the ship 's tanks and which are a ticking ecological time bomb as the area is a protected sea sanctuary for whales , porpoises and dolphins			2
meanwhile captain @entity0 , who was off duty on the @entity5 when the disaster struck and who has been hailed as a hero after giving the order to abandon ship , broke his silence and said : ' only a disgraceful man would have left all those passengers on board			1
' captain @entity0 , 45 , who was seen helping dozens of women and children into lifeboats , added : ' it was the most horrible experience of my life			1
' a tragedy , a heartache that i will carry with me forever			2
we managed to avoid the worse and have the world crash down around us			0
i just want to rest and forget			0
do n't call me a hero			0
i just did my duty , the duty of a sea captain - actually the duty of a normal man			2
' @entity55 and the others with me just did our duty			0
we looked each other in the eyes for a second and then we just got on with it			0
' discovery : a scuba diver is pictured dragging a body out from the stricken cruise liner @entity5 as the confirmed death toll rises to 11 blasting through : the bright flash of an explosion shows where @entity35 navy divers have used ' micro-charges ' to force their way through the hull of the capsized @entity5 - in a bid to find missing passengers and crew			1

captain @entity0 was off - duty but still organised entire rescue effort
' it was the most horrible experience of my life . a tragedy , a heartache that i will carry with me forever '
captain @entity67 said @entity2 was ' a braggart , a show - off and drove the ship like a @entity66 '
@entity35 divers suspend search as capsized ship shifts slightly on its rocky resting place
increased fears liner could plummet 100m to bottom of the sea
confirmed death toll stands at 11 , with 24 still missing
concerns grow of *environmental* disaster over *500,000* *gallons* of fuel
