@entity1 's wife has quit her big - money job on @entity3 in what could be a sign her husband has decided to run for president in 2016			2
may @entity9 , 51 , a managing director at @entity11 finance firm @entity10 , ditched her $ 475,000 - a - year position this week , a family spokesman confirmed			1
the official reason for the resignation was ' to spend more time with her family and young children '			0
but many will see the move as a sign that @entity22 governor @entity21 , 52 , is coming closer to seeking the @entity24 nomination for the 2016 presidential election			1
she is often seen out on the campaign trail with @entity21 , making a recent appearance in @entity37 - a necessary stop for would - be presidents			1
earlier this month the @entity40 said they were undecided about what @entity21 should do with her job , and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting			2
@entity21 said then that leaving a career would be ' a big sacrifice for a spouse to make ' , and that it also ' would n't be a requirement ' , even if he did run for president			0
more of this ? the move is likely a precursor to @entity21 's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from mrs @entity21 , pictured above with her husband in @entity37 her decision mirrors that of another @entity3 @entity24 spouse - @entity62 's wife , @entity64 mrs @entity65 , whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign , immediately took unpaid leave from her high - powered position at @entity70 , and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign			1
mrs @entity21 's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the @entity40 ' income			1
the family 's latest tax returns , from 2013 , revealed that she brought in the lion 's share of the family 's earnings			0
not the breadwinner : @entity21 's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him she reported a $ 510,000 total salary , made up of the $ 475,000 managing director 's pay packet and around $ 35,000 from a side job as a bond trader			2
in the same year @entity21 's gubernatorial salary was $ 175,000			0
however , during his visit to a @entity37 newspaper 's editorial board he insisted his family is ' not wealthy by current standards ' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return			0
he later tried to clarify his comments by saying ' we have four children to raise and a lot of things to do ' - but many pointed out that he still easily sits in the wealthiest 1 per cent of his home state .			0

@entity21 , 51 , quit her position at finance firm @entity111
reportedly told colleagues the move would precede a @entity21 campaign
