by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 08:53 est , 18 april 2013 @entity2 tribute ? mrs @entity3 chose a neat hat and pussy bow blouse she was perhaps paying tribute to the @entity7 , famous for her political wardrobe of pillbox hats and pussy - bow blouses			1
but @entity3 ’s choice of outfit to @entity2 ’s funeral failed to take off with fashion watchers			1
her gold pussy - bow blouse and neat grey hat inspired a bout of mild teasing on @entity20 , where she was likened to an air stewardess			1
some even reworked her nickname , dubbing the prime minister ’s wife ‘ @entity23 ’			2
one user , @entity25 asked : ‘ why did @entity3 come dressed as a flight attendant ? ’ @entity27 wrote : ‘ @entity3 is channelling her inner air hostess with choice of outfit today			1
i keep expecting her to point out the exits			0
’ and @entity33 said : ‘ i ’m sure i saw @entity23 working on my @entity35 flight the other day			0
’ as a fashion power player , mrs @entity3 puts a lot of thought into her attire			1
she knows clothes deliver a message – hence her prudent ‘ recycling ’ of the same clothes for public engagements , and her desire to team expensive pieces with low - cost brands such as @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			2
for high - profile occasions , mrs @entity3 usually looks the antithesis of a traditional @entity54 wife , choosing to champion up - and - coming and edgy @entity57 labels such as @entity58 or @entity59			1
distinctive style : mrs @entity3 could not have chosen a more fitting sartorial tribute , looking elegant but demure as she arrived at @entity62 with her husband true blues : @entity3 held the pm 's hand as they walked to the service , a dark wool coat worn over her skirt and @entity72 blouse and an elegant sinamay hat , mirroring a style often wore by @entity2 and because fussy buttoned - up necklines are strictly not her usual style , it ’s all the more unthinkable that yesterday ’s blouse , teamed with a black pencil skirt , nude @entity81 ‘ @entity82 ’ heels , costing £ 360 , and dark grey pillbox hat , was unintentional			1
the pussy - bow is a style that our first and only woman prime minister trademarked during her tenure , most notably during a photocall aboard the ‘ @entity90 ’ , ahead of her first election victory in 1979			1
pussy - bow blouses first became fashionable in the 1940s , but the sterner more buttoned - up power dressing version we know today found favour in the late 1970s and remained popular throughout the 1980s			1
seen as the feminine equivalent to a man ’s shirt and tie , the style became the office staple for a new generation of women in male - dominated offices who wanted to look powerful but feminine			1
no wonder then , that @entity2 wore a great many versions of this look to one of the most masculine of all work places – @entity109			1
substance over style : the @entity112 said she always aimed to dress appropriately - and that did n't mean forgoing femininity the bows , which she personally deemed ‘ softening and pretty ’ were used to temper the formal skirt suits that were the complementary weapon in her power - dressing armoury			1
‘ what you do is decide the clothes in which you are comfortable , ’ she said at the time			0
‘ you must be comfortable			0
you are going to a great occasion			0
it must be a style that you are comfortable in			2
' it must be a fabric that you are comfortable in , that hangs well , and you must know that you look appropriate for the occasion			0
never flashy , just appropriate			0
’ @entity130 : @entity132 's hat resembled a cake tin while @entity134 teamed a pearl necklace with a white trimmed hat formal : @entity138 dressed in a traditional fedora hat while @entity141 's headwear was inspired by @entity142 which is more than can be said for mrs @entity3 , whose outfits have caused controversy – and plenty of @entity20 debate – before			1
her decision to wear a jewelled hairpiece , rather than a hat , to the royal wedding two years ago caused much consternation , as did some of her outfits during the @entity155 ’ @entity157 visit last year			0
however , @entity2 would perhaps have approved of mrs @entity3 ’s frugal approach to dressing			1
although the gold blouse by @entity161 designer @entity72 was a hefty £ 280 , she has worn it twice before – to a tea party in 2008 , then to her daughter @entity166 ’s christening in 2011			2
chic and cosy : @entity168 , left , wore a warm looking fur hat , while @entity170 had her hat at the right angle mrs @entity3 did seem to get the dress code right in one respect : neat millinery was the order of the day , with political wives and celebrities all opting for small chic hats			1
@entity181 ’s chic felt fascinator featured an over-sized bow and crown princess @entity183 of @entity184 chose a small hat topped with a circle of net and a brooch embellishment			2
@entity189 : mrs brown chose neat millinery while @entity191 got the memo , perching her hat decorated with a birdcage veil and flower on the back of her head , @entity132 missed the mark with a large hat reminiscent of a cake tin covered in satin			0
dame @entity168 chose to keep warm in a trim fur beret , while dame @entity134 , wife of former prime minister sir @entity204 , opted for a classic black and white hat , which she teamed with a double string of pearls			2
deputy prime minister @entity209 ’s wife @entity208 looked effortlessly chic in a flat saucer hat with a sculpted veil , which she wore to the side of her head			2
foreign secretary @entity215 ’s wife @entity214 wore an elegant black velvet pillbox hat , and @entity220 leader @entity219 ’s wife @entity218 wore a pillbox hat that was subtle and discreet			2
less successful were the choices of deputy labour leader @entity138 and home secretary @entity141			0
while miss @entity138 opted for a casual - looking felt fedora , mrs may managed to obscure most of her face with a 1920s style hat , featuring a large satin bow , which could have come straight off the set of @entity142			1
the rest of her outfit did just the trick however , as she paired a black pencil skirt with a cropped black suit jacket buttoned at the waist			0
mrs may limited her accessories to a simple brooch , leather gloves and a pair of her signature kitten heels			0
she was accompanied by her husband of 32 years , investment banker husband @entity240			0
out in force : @entity215 with husband @entity215 , left , and @entity242 with husband @entity219 taking the plunge : @entity244 yesterday the guest list was certainly eclectic			0
but some mourners had no difficulty standing out from the crowd			0
namely classical singer @entity244 , who seemed determined to show - off her curves in a plunging cocktail - style dress and flared overcoat			2
the 32 - year - old mezzo - soprano , who is thought to have met @entity2 through their charity work for the @entity256 , sparked outrage on @entity20 from users who thought the dress was inappropriate for the stately occasion			1
@entity261 , said : ‘ just for a change , or perhaps in honour of the occasion , @entity244 could have put her cleavage away			0
’ @entity265 said she was ‘ not sure @entity244 ’s cleavage is appropriate ’ , while @entity266 added : ‘ i think @entity244 could have put her cleavage away for just one day # thatcherfuneral			0
’ fortunately from the neck upwards , miss @entity244 , a favourite of the royal family who has lunched privately with the @entity270 , was the epitome of elegance in a black @entity275 pillbox hat with netting .			0

@entity279 's wife wore a cream silk pussy - bow blouse for the funeral at @entity283 's
the @entity286 style was made popular in the 1980s
@entity3 's sartorial tribute recalled @entity2 's favoured look
many mourners also wore pearls as a *nod* to the @entity7
