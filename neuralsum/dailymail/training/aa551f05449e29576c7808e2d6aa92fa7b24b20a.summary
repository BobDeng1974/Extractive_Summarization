@entity0 has spoken of his delight at being back in his national setup after a spending a year in the @entity4 wilderness			1
the @entity6 striker has not started for @entity7 since last summer 's 3 - 0 defeat at the hands of @entity10 in the @entity12 final - a game in which he was unceremoniously hauled off after 59 minutes			1
@entity0 was actually the joint top scorer in the tournament - along with @entity10 striker @entity14 - but in fairness four of his five goals did came in their 10 - 0 group stage drubbing of minnows @entity18 : scroll down for @entity7 boss @entity20 delays naming 23 - man squad delighted : @entity0 is happy to be back with the national team after nearly a year uncapped golden boot : @entity0 was joint top scorer at @entity12 last summer , although four came vs @entity25 a mixture of injuries and dreadful form had kept the 30 - year - old out of @entity20 's team all season , but a slight upturn in performances towards the end convinced his national manager that he was worthy of a place in the provisional 30 - man list			1
and @entity0 will get a chance to prove his worth in the upcoming warm up game against @entity42 , having been named in a 19 - man squad that has omitted other strikers @entity45 , @entity46 and the injured @entity47			1
' it 's very nice to be back with the national team			2
i 've gone a year without being with @entity7 , since the @entity12 , ' he said			1
' i knew that anything could happen			0
yesterday , i was only hoping to hear my name			0
i knew that i could 've been here or not , but now i have a better chance of being in @entity10			0
' it 's been a difficult year but i finished the season very well			2
i 'm grateful for the words of @entity20 , who has valued my performances in the final phases			2
' there 's always been a lot of competition here since the 2008 @entity64 , @entity65 , ( @entity67 ) @entity66 , ( @entity68 ) @entity69 , @entity46 , now @entity47 ... ' the level is very high , but we 're not rivals , we 're team - mates and whoever is chosen to play has the support of everyone			2
' now to fight during these days to be in the final list for @entity10			0
' problems : @entity47 went off injured in the @entity79 final and is a doubt for the @entity81 beast mode : @entity83 striker @entity46 is also in the squad despite having not scored since january @entity0 links up with his national team on the back of what has been a mixed season for @entity6			1
the @entity89 have enjoyed plenty of success over the last decade but suffered a rare barren year in 2013/14 under returning coach @entity92 , although they did finish third in the @entity93 and reach the semi-finals of the @entity79			0
' it 's been a strange year overall , one of transition at the club , " said @entity0 , who scored 11 times for @entity6 last season			1
' we 've been close in everything but in the end we 've not managed to get anything after several years of winning titles			0
' on a personal level , it 's been the same			0
but to be here ( with @entity7 ) is a great prize			2
' i 've played less minutes than in other seasons and , maybe , that could be good to be better physically			0
' i 'm happy and looking forward to getting started			0
