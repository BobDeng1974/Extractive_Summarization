by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 10:58 est , 6 march 2013 it may be minus 40 degrees @entity3 outside but the outer surface of an emperor penguin is even colder than the air around it , scientists have discovered			1
pictures captured with an infrared thermal imager show that the penguins ’ outer surfaces are on average between four and six degrees @entity3 cooler than the surrounding air			1
researchers at the @entity15 studied images of 40 penguins and discovered that the part of a penguin that is covered by thick plumage , dubbed a ' cold coat ' , is colder than the surrounding air			0
the scientists also discovered that the only part of the birds ’ surface that is warmer than freezing is the eye			0
dr @entity39 , a biophysical ecologist at the @entity15 , told the @entity40 : ‘ most of the body that is covered by thick plumage was found to be , on average , 4 to 6 degrees @entity3 colder than surrounding air temperature			1
‘ at first , we were very surprised by this discovery			0
’ the scientists believe that the observations of the breeding colony in @entity50 , @entity51 , suggest that extreme radiative cooling draws heat from a penguin ’s surface			1
the only part of the birds ' surface that is warmer than freezing is the eye dr @entity39 next hopes to use thermal imaging to study how huddling together helps penguins save energy radiative cooling occurs when heat is released into space from the penguins ’ body surface making it cooler than might otherwise be expected			1
the report , which was published in @entity68 , also claims that because of the penguins ’ layers of insulating fat and feathers they can maintain a body temperature of 39 degrees @entity3 even when the air temperature is minus 40			2

radiative cooling is the process by which a body loses heat through thermal radiation			2
it is commonly experienced on cloudless nights when heat is released into the atmosphere from the surface of the @entity87 , or the outer surface of an animal			2
it is the sum of the three sources of radiation : outgoing radiation from objects versus incoming sky and cloud radiation			0
maximum radiative cooling occurs when the sky is clear , it is dry and there is little wind .			0

the outer surface of an emperor penguin is colder than the air around it
on average the surface is four to six degrees @entity3 colder than the air
the only exposed parts that are warmer are the eyes , beak and feet
scientists believe extreme radiative cooling is the *explanation*
