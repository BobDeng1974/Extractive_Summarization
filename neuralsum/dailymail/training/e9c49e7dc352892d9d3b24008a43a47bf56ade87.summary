it is the curse of tourists around the world - mispronouncing common place names such as @entity4 , @entity5 , or @entity7 's @entity6			1
now , @entity8 could come to the rescue - with a pronunciation guide that tells you exactly how the locals say their streets			1
the firm 's latest patent reveals the plans for the service			1
@entity8 could determine the most common pronunciation of a place name from audio clips submitted by locals			1
this could then be used to find the most common pronunciation			2
software could then find the most common recorded file , and play it to users when someone searches for the place on @entity34			1
the patent details how @entity8 could determine the most common pronunciation of a place name from audio clips submitted by locals , then offer that pronunciation when someone searches for the place on @entity34			1
this function could be handy , as @entity8 says in the patent , ' when traveling in a foreign country			2
' ' systems and methods are provided to select a most typical pronunciation of a location name on a map from a plurality of user pronunciations , ' the application says			0
' a server generates a reference speech model based on user pronunciations , compares the user pronunciations with the speech model and selects a pronunciation based on comparison			0
' ' alternatively , the server compares the distance between one the user pronunciations and every other user pronunciations and selects a pronunciation based on comparison			0
' the server then annotates the map with the selected pronunciation and provides the audio output of the location name to a user device upon a user 's request			0
' the place name used in the patent filing is @entity73 - the name of a city in the @entity76 , and also of one in @entity78 and ten places in the @entity80 â€” and it is pronounced slightly differently in each country			0
@entity8 could determine the most common pronunciation of a place name from audio clips submitted by locals			1
this could then be used to find the most common pronunciation			0
@entity8 said the patent does n't necessarily mean that @entity8 will be adding this functionality to its maps anytime soon : ' some of those ideas later mature into real products or services , some do n't , ' a spokeswoman said			1
@entity8 also recently officially launched speech translation as part of its translate app. both @entity99 and @entity101 users can now talk to the app and get a written translation of what they 're saying , in real time , on the screen			2
the move builds on @entity8 's current tools , which offer written translation of 90 languages , as well spoken translations in a select number of languages on @entity101 devices			2
' often the hardest part of travelling is navigating the local language , ' said @entity119 , product lead for @entity121			0
' now @entity121 can be your guide in new ways			0
asking for directions to the @entity125 , ordering bacalhau in @entity127 , or chatting with your grandmother in her native @entity129 just got a lot faster			0
