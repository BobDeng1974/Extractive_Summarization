@entity1 , 35 , inflicted years of abuse on to his teenage victim after grooming him while working as a rugby coach at a prestigious Â£ 28,000 - a - year quaker school			1
he subjected the boy , who was 13 when the abuse began , to intimate ' sports massages ' and carried out sick ' physical tests ' to ensure he was in peak condition			1
@entity18 , who worked at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , was arrested in 2011 when his victim , who can not be named for legal reasons , admitted the abuse to his horrified parents			1
the teacher denied the offences but was found guilty of 16 charges of sexual abusing the young boy over a two year period and jailed for 10 years yesterday			2
yesterday judge @entity32 said that @entity18 was guilty of indulging his own sexual gratification and the offences were an ' abuse of trust in the highest measure '			1
he said : ' in my judgement from the evidence you were indulging your own personal ambition and your sexual gratification in your relationship with this boy			2
' not only was this an abuse of trust in the highest measure , it is not hard to imagine the guilt felt by the complainant 's parents on being duped by you			0
' the court was told how @entity18 forged a close relationship with the schoolboy and his parents , and quickly became his main confidant			2
the coach gained the boy 's trust when working at the school , and at a nearby rugby club , which the boy also attended			0
he carried out sick ' physical tests ' on the boy and gave him intimate sports massages in the abuse - which did not take place on school property			1
@entity71 , prosecuting at @entity70 , said : ' he gained complete trust and affection of a young , talented rugby player			0
he abused the relationship for his own sexual advantage			0
' as a consequence he was able to seduce and groom the victim and that was because he had considerable affection and loyalty towards him			0
' the abuse reached its peak when the youngster , aged only 13 , revealed that he thought he was gay - it was then @entity18 made his victim masturbate with him and perform oral sex			1
former teacher @entity1 , 35 , leaves @entity70			1
he has been jailed for 10 years after forcing a student to strip naked for ' physical tests ' before subjecting him to horrific abuse @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , where @entity18 worked			1
he was then arrested in 2011 on one occasion , while on a rugby trip to @entity92 , his victim awoke to find @entity18 performing oral sex on him , on another @entity18 climbed into the bath with the teen and began to fondle him			1
judge @entity32 heard how @entity18 first met his victim , when he was aged only 12 , after he became a pupil at @entity19 and joined the rugby team			1
the talented youngster was also a member of his local rugby club where @entity18 often coached			2
the former teacher at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , gained so much of the teenage boy 's trust that he believed the actions were normal manipulative @entity18 singled his victim out after he began using techniques such as describing sexual matters to evaluate his reaction and giving him ' physical tests ' as a ' cloak to mask his attraction '			1
the former teacher , from @entity113 , @entity21 , was even warned of his behaviour after other coaches began getting suspicious but this did not stop him			2
when his victim admitted he was gay @entity18 took his abuse to the next level , asking the school boy if he would masturbate in front on him , with the coach doing likewise			1
the teenager complied with @entity18 's requests , which also saw him perform a set act , after he was ' very much in the thrall and became highly flattered by the attention '			2
my @entity71 added : ' to have an adult prepared to engage in sexual actions was something he found alluding			0
' there was a close bond of loyalty but this relationship was exploitative and it was wrong			0
' @entity18 used this close bond and trust to work himself into a position of trust with the victim 's family , who believed he was giving their son one - on - one sessions to further his rugby career			1
he denied all charges brought against him but was found guilty by a majority verdict on december 6			0
@entity18 was handed 10 years behind bars on the 11 counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child and five counts of penetrative sexual activity with a child			1
an initial police investigation was launched in february 2006 after allegation about the abuse came to light but the teenager refused to co-operate , insisting nothing was going on			0
the investigation collapsed in july 2006 , but a fresh probe was launched in 2011 when the victim finally admitted the abuse to his parents			1
detective chief inspector @entity167 , who led the investigation , said : ' @entity1 is a manipulative man who insinuated himself into the lives of this victim and his family			1
' @entity1 is a manipulative man who insinuated himself into the lives of this victim and his family			1
' @entity172 @entity167 ' he regularly sat at their dinner table and was welcomed into their lives as a trusted friend , teacher and coach to their son			0
' his betrayal and abuse has left them completely distraught			0
' in the most calculating fashion , @entity18 groomed his victim to gain complete control over him			2
' such was his hold , it has taken six years for his victim to disclose the abuse he suffered at @entity18 's hands			1
' the sentence passed by @entity193 today will ensure that @entity1 is finally behind bars for a minimum of 10 years and , as a managed sex offender for the rest of his life , will never work with children again			2
' during sentencing , judge @entity200 , said : ' you abused the trust of a young boy and the trust of his parents , and you brought shame on them			0

he said : ' but you did this to indulge your sexual interests with this boy			0
in his evidence , the boy used the phrase ' hero worship ' to describe his relationship with you			0
' having gained his trust you then gained the trust of his parents			0
' the court heard the boy 's family was ' duped ' by @entity18 who entrusted their son into his care outside school for rugby matches and an overseas trip			2
he said : ' it is not hard to imagine how this boy 's family feel after being duped by you			0
he worshipped and trusted you , and lied to the police to save your skin			0
' even then you met him again and abused him			0
' a spokesman from the school said : ' our safeguarding procedures , both now and at the time of these incidents , are completely compliant and all necessary checks on the suitability of @entity1 to work with children were carried out by the school			2
' however , unfortunately no vetting system can guarantee that every paedophile is identified			0
