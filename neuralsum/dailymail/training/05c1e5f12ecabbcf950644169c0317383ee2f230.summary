with his lightning strike in the @entity3 ’s opening @entity5 match , @entity0 finally moved out of the shadow of his celebrated colleague @entity7			1
the goal , scored just 29 seconds after kick off helping to secure victory over long - time rival @entity10 , was the fastest ever by a @entity13 player			1
but it was a gesture during his celebrations just seconds after the ball hit the net that gives a glimpse into the two tragedies in the player ’s life that have driven the newly dubbed @entity23 to success			2
as he ran around the pitch he looked up and then raised his fingers to the sky			1
@entity0 ’s rise to the top of @entity13 soccer - the only @entity13 player to have scored in three consecutive @entity5 campaigns - is a remarkable rags - to - riches story that would be considered far - fetched if it were a @entity55 script			1
now 31 , he was brought up in the family 's trailer in the backyard of his grandparents ' home on the outskirts of @entity62 , a small town in @entity63			1
the fourth of five children , he and his older brother @entity64 became hooked on soccer after watching @entity68 boys from his neighborhood kicking around a basketball with their bare feet on a dirt field			2
rolled - up socks were used as goalposts			2
happy days : @entity0 enjoys a fun vacation with his family in @entity78 braveheart : @entity0 's brother @entity64 pays tribute to @entity46 in his own way : he has an intricate tattoo of her face surrounded by flowers engraved on his chest forgoing traditional @entity13 sports , he threw himself into the game			1
it was not long before his family recognized his talent , and when he turned 10 they decided to see if others saw it too			1
his father , @entity95 , a carpenter , drove him for three hours to @entity96 to trials for a local club team called the @entity99			1
the manager threw a ball to the young @entity0 , watched him trap it and then juggle it with his feet , and immediately he also was a believer			1
two or three times a week the family embarked on the six - hour round trip and his dad sold his boat and guns to pay for the gas money			1
his mother , a nurse , worked every overtime shift she could and the family forewent their annual holiday			2
special occasions were spent in @entity119 ’s , the five siblings sharing one meal between them			0
' my parents were crazy , ' said @entity0 told the @entity124			1
' they just wanted to do everything they could for their kids			0
' sacrifice : @entity0 's mother , a nurse , worked every overtime shift she could and the family forewent their annual holiday to launch his soccer career but the family had another budding sports star in their midst and something had to give			1
his elder sister @entity46 was so good at tennis she was about to turn professional and the family made the difficult decision to pull him out of the league and direct resources to her			1
the decision left the 12 - year - old “ upset and angry ' but he accepted it because he was very close to his sister			1
but that heartache was nothing compared with what was to come			0
soon after the decision , his sister , then 16 , had fainted and been rushed to hospital			2
she had actually suffered a brain aneurism and needed surgery			1
he arrived at the hospital after everybody else and was told that his sister had not made it through			2
“ they tell you and your heart falls from your chest , ” he told the @entity124			0
' you hit the ground and you cry for hours			2
you cry until your head aches			0
' while the tragedy still hurts today , it allowed him to resume his football career and made him even more determined to succeed			0
special occasions : the five siblings shared one meal between them at @entity174 's to save for @entity0 's training			1
his father , @entity95 , a carpenter , drove him to @entity96 - six hours round - tip - to a local club team @entity0 explained that he had earlier spoken to his sister about death and she had said that if she died “ i will help you get the ball in the net			1
' ' and that 's why i look up to the sky now when i score - to remember her , ' he said			1
he played with even more intensity when he returned to @entity96 and won a place at @entity188 , a small private institution , in @entity189 , on a sports scholarship			1
@entity191 , his coach at @entity192 , said he was ' consumed ’ by the game			0
' he was playing two or three years above his age and yet it still was not enough			0
he always wanted to challenge himself			0
' he was so hungry for success			0
i think he still is			0
there was a fire inside him			0
' at about this time , he became close friends with a @entity68 teenager named @entity202 ' they started out as rivals but became friends , ' said @entity191			0
' they were good for each other			0
' while @entity0 made the cut for university , @entity202 just missed out and trained to be policeman			1
it was to lead to the second major tragedy in @entity0 ’s life			1
just days before he was to take up his post , @entity202 accidentally shot himself in the head – his gun going off as he picked up an ear plug from the floor			1
@entity3 : @entity0 hangs out with his sister @entity221 and baby once again , @entity0 was devastated , but once again he channeled the emotion to better himself at football			1
and in tribute to his old friend he also holds up a finger after scoring			1
' people just see @entity0 ’s passion , they do n't see how compassionate and caring he is , ' @entity191 said			2
' they do n't realize what he has gone through			0
' at @entity188 , @entity0 thrived so much that the @entity231 , based near @entity232 , signed him before he even graduated			2
from there he became one of the first @entity13 outfield players to move to the @entity236 , considered by many to be the best in the world			2
he started at @entity240 , a small @entity241 based club , and had to overcome prejudice from sceptical @entity244 players and fans , who did not consider the @entity3 a serious footballing nation			2
he thrived so much that bigger rivals @entity247 poached him			0
but the tight , aggressive @entity244 game , did not always suit his maverick and flamboyant style			0
by now married and with three kids he decided to return to the @entity3 and joined the @entity252 , where he currently plays			2
@entity253 , the @entity244 - born coach at @entity188 , said : ' he was confident but he was also always working on his game			0
@entity255 : @entity202 ( no. 13 top left ) started out as @entity0 's rival but they ended up as close friends on their high school team ( @entity0 is no. 11 top right )			1
@entity202 was training to be policeman when he accidentally shot himself in the head ¿ his gun going off as he picked up an ear plug from the floor ' he was training , training , training			2
he was always challenging himself			0
he was always taking risks			0
@entity269 took him to @entity241 in his first year and we got tickets to see @entity240 play @entity272			0
' five years later he was playing in the same game and i watched as he scored the winner that kept @entity240 in the @entity236			0
' it was an amazing moment			0
' along the way he became a permanent member of the @entity13 team , making his @entity5 debut in 2006			2
but in the eyes of the @entity13 public he always played second fiddle to @entity7 until now			1
despite his towering ambition he has always kept his feet firmly on the ground and put his family first			0
when he won the @entity289 in 2006 , he donated the truck to his father			0
and when his sister @entity221 ’s wedding took place just before a crucial match for the @entity3 in 2011 , he told the coach he was going “ regardless ” of the consequences			1
in the end , he flew back , the night before the match day and took part in the game			0
now that @entity7 has been left out of the squad , @entity0 , wearing the captain ’s armband , has come to the fore			1
' i do n’t think he actually realizes what he has achieved , ' said @entity307			0
' this is his time			0
he is one of the greatest players the @entity13 has ever had			2
it has been a truly amazing journey that he has undertaken			0

@entity3 captain @entity0 scored just 29 seconds after kick off and went on to beat long - time rival @entity10
when he scores he raises his fingers to the sky in tribute to his sister @entity46 who died of a brain aneurism and best friend who accidently shot himself in the head
two or three times a week his family drove him six hours round trip from @entity62 , @entity63 to @entity96 so he could hone his soccer skills
in the eyes of the @entity13 public he always played second fiddle to @entity7 ... until now .
