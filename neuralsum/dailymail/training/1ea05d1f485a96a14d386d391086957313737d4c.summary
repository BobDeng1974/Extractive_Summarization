by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:59 est , 26 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:30 est , 26 december 2013 the @entity3 have called one of their former players back out of retirement and in return he is giving away his $ 53,000 gameday paycheck			1
@entity9 played for the @entity11 team for two years starting in 2009 but retired in january of 2012			2
from there he returned to his hometown of @entity14 , @entity15 and became a high school math teacher and the coach of the football team			2
when his former teammate , quarterback @entity19 suffered from a back injury that will leave him out of the much anticipated game against the @entity22 on sunday that decides who heads to the playoffs , @entity9 texted his old coach and said that he would be happy to help			1
back in the game : @entity9 played for the @entity3 for two years ( seen here at a november 2010 game ) but retired in january 2012 and now he is going back to play on sunday to fill in for @entity19 ' i told @entity29 ( @entity30 ) if he wants me or somebody to come in and call a play and be able to pull a play off if a bad situation happened , i would be willing to do that , ' @entity9 told the @entity36 about his communication with the coach			1
@entity30 was clearly in a tough spot because with @entity19 's injury , the fate of the game would likely fall to @entity43 , who has served as @entity19 's back up for the past two seasons but has not seen much play time			0
he also tested out three other possible quarterback substitutes , but after just a 30 minute phone call with his old pal @entity9 , @entity30 agreed to put him back in the game			0
@entity9 , 41 , is expected to serve as back up for @entity43 during the game on sunday			2
' so he ’s a very active guy			0
he ’s a mentally tough guy ... and he ’s certainly very young at heart			0
so it was good to have him back , good to have him back in the meetings , and ( i ’m ) excited to see him practice today , ' @entity30 told the paper			0
even though he is getting back into the game , @entity9 is n't forgetting the new band of teammates he leads in @entity15 , as he agreed to donate his earnings from sunday 's game to the school where he was teaching			1
his new life : @entity9 started working as a math teacher at @entity66 in his hometown of @entity14 , @entity15 keeping active : @entity9 , 41 , did n't leave the sport though as he coached the school 's football team @entity9 will earn $ 53,000 for sunday 's game and all of it is going to @entity66 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
that amount is just shy of the salary of a teacher in the area , as $ 57,650 is the average annual take home pay for a teacher at a @entity14 public high school			1
@entity9 is a father of four and his eldest son @entity80 was unable to play for his father 's team last year because they technically lived outside of the school district .			0

@entity9 , 41 , was a back up quarterback for the @entity3 for two years before retiring in january 2012
went on to teach match and coach football for a public high school in his hometown of @entity14 , @entity15
now that @entity19 is injured , the @entity3 were looking for a backup quarterback to assist their number 2 and @entity9 reached out
*announced* he will give his paycheck of $ 53,000 from sunday 's game to @entity66 *-* just shy of an average teacher 's annual salary
helping out in *crucial* sunday game against @entity22 that decides whether or not they make it to the playoffs
