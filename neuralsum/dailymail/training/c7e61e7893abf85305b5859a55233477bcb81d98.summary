the outcome was barely in doubt			0
even when they threatened to nod off and allowed @entity28 to shorten the deficit , five minutes into the second half , @entity3 struck again , through @entity51			1
the sight of a @entity51 goal always signifies a special occasion for @entity3 supporters			1
this was only his fifth in more than eight years at the club , and his first ever in the @entity14			2
another treat for fans at the @entity29 was a hotly anticipated debut for @entity117 , an 18 - year - old midfielder , who has advanced through the club ’s youth ranks to great acclaim			1
he is the flag - bearer of what they hope will be the ‘ made in @entity3 ’ generation but it will take more than this brief cameo to establish that			1
there was also a favour for former favourite @entity132			0
defeat for @entity28 allowed his @entity135 team to progress at their expense with a win in @entity139 , but most important for @entity13 was a professional reaction to saturday ’s defeat			1
‘ we were focused and serious , ’ said the @entity3 boss , satisfied his squad have the mental application to launch another long unbeaten run			2
‘ we showed a good attitude and did what we had to do			0
we played seriously and deserved to win			0
’ that said , @entity28 did not provide the most formidable opposition and seemed strangely uninterested in acquiring the point which would have been enough for them to qualify for the last 16			1
this has not the most testing of @entity14 groups for @entity3			1
but , not only were they prolific , with 17 goals , they conceded only three in six games			0
@entity157 and @entity158 leap out as those to avoid in monday ’s draw for the last 16 but @entity13 said : ‘ we have five possible opponents and each one is hard			2
@entity162 would be good because it ’s easy for travel and easy for our fans			0
you think @entity166 is easy ? we lost twice against them last year			0
@entity168 is not easy , or @entity170			0
‘ i do n’t think any of the big teams is out			0
maybe @entity167 , but all the teams who want to win it are in it			0
there are a few sharks in the ocean , but i like it this way			0
’ @entity13 swam with sharks on holiday in @entity181			2
‘ i did n’t want to go , but my wife and kids pushed me , ’ he grinned			0
this time , he goes happily into the knockout phase of a competition he has twice won			0
‘ the real @entity14 starts now , ’ said @entity13			1
‘ what can we do ? i do n’t know			0
last season , we were not one of the top four for sure and we played in the semi-finals			0
let ’s see what we can do this time step by step			0
’ this win was achieved while resting players like @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity61 and @entity198 and those who stepped in proved they are ready and able			2
there was the reassuring presence of @entity46 in goal and it was an important night for @entity55 and @entity50 , who were in tandem on the left and quickly capitalised on the inexperience of right - back @entity67			1
@entity207 gave the @entity31 side a lifeline to make it 2 - 1 , but @entity28 head out of the @entity14 the midfielder is congratulated by @entity213 during the @entity215 clash @entity51 taps in a third from barely a yard out to seal the game for the hosts teenager @entity117 comes on to replace @entity23 with 10 minutes remaining @entity50 is felled in the box early on before @entity23 slots home @entity3 's opener @entity50 squared up to @entity67 , stuck the ball through his legs and drew the foul			1
@entity23 converted the penalty in the eighth minute			2
@entity25 , making his first start since he was hauled off at half - time during a draw @entity139 last month , scored the second from the edge of the box			1
the move started on the left with @entity50 then @entity52 carrying the ball forward			2
@entity25 controlled the pass , turned centre - half @entity68 and unleashed a crisp drive which flashed into the bottom corner			2
@entity28 offered little more after the interval , but as @entity3 relaxed and lost impetus , @entity207 pulled a goal back			1
@entity117 is welcomed to @entity246 football with a crunching tackle from @entity69 at @entity29 @entity3 players comfort the debutant after he is taken out on the half - way line @entity57 was a menace up front again but failed to get onto the scoresheet on this occasion @entity70 shows off his @entity254 celebration after scoring at @entity29 @entity51 , starting in his second successive game , is tracked by @entity76 of @entity28 @entity55 - tracked by @entity69 and @entity213 - was handed a rare start at @entity29 @entity25 was guilty of failing to deal with a deep and swirling cross and his clearance fell to @entity70 who took the ball down on his chest and volleyed low past @entity46			1
for six minutes , there was a game on , but @entity13 ’s players stirred and @entity51 struck , toe - ending the ball over the goal - line from a couple of inches , after a swerving free - kick , taken by @entity23 , had been flicked on at the near post			1
this was the sign for @entity13 to send on his substitutes including @entity117 with seven minutes to go			2
‘ i said to him , i give you this and you give me a nice bottle of red wine , ’ said @entity13			0
‘ he said , “ no problem ”			0
’ @entity13 chucked oon the bench as several of @entity3 's regulars watch on from the stands the travelling @entity28 fans let off a green flare in the stand to show their colours for their team @entity3 defender @entity48 grabs a hold of @entity76 during the game it was a tough night for @entity28 and their young coach @entity85 @entity69 goes down holding his face after clashing with @entity50 @entity56 came on as a substitute but the poacher was unable to get on target for the @entity37 @entity297 shows off his skills in the warm - up - the teenager was named on @entity3 's bench on wednesday night			1

@entity3 and @entity135 qualify from @entity215 in the @entity14 after both side 's win
@entity13 rested several players but two early goals set them on the @entity37 on their way
@entity23 opened the scoring after @entity50 was fouled in the box
@entity25 's classy finish put the hosts 2 - 0 up inside 20 minutes at @entity29
@entity207 gives @entity28 a lifeline but @entity51 wraps up *victory* with rare goal
