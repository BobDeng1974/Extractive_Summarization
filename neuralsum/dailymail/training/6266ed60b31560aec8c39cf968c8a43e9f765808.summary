by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 05:35 est , 22 june 2012 a schoolboy dying from a brain tumour has stunned his family with his bravery after responding to his terminal condition by saying : ' you ca n’t win them all			1
' @entity8 , who is just 16 , said he has accepted he is ' stuffed ' following a five year battle against the disease			1
up until five weeks ago @entity8 thought he had beaten the @entity12 tumour but relapsed an hour after posting a video on @entity14 telling the world he was recovering			1
doctors told the family the condition was now terminal and @entity8 and his parents decided not to prolong @entity8 ’s pain and suffering by giving him more chemotherapy or radiation			1
the teenager may have just weeks left to live and is focusing on making it to his school leavers prom on june 28			2
@entity8 said : ' i ’ve relapsed several times - but now i ’m kind of stuffed			1
but hey , you ca n’t win them all			0
' @entity8 , from @entity42 , in @entity43 , has n’t been able to go to school for the past month because his short - term memory is so badly affected by the tumour			1
he also relies on 15 tablets a day to help with the pain			0
his mother has launched an awareness campaign to highlight the importance of detecting brain tumours in children at an early stage			1
@entity8 , pictured surfing in @entity56			2
the trip was paid for by the charity @entity58 although @entity8 displayed the symptoms of the disease when he was 11 , they were not simultaneous and it took five - and - half weeks to get a diagnosis			1
had it been detected sooner , the tumour would have been around half the size it was and @entity8 would have stood a much better chance of survival			2
the symptoms of the @entity12 brain tumour include vomiting , headaches , and unusual eye movements			1
@entity8 has undergone several operations since the age of 11 to remove the golf - ball sized tumour but has since suffered two relapses			1
@entity8 's mother , @entity78			1
she said @entity8 has shown her how to cope by being so strong he said : ' before i was diagnosed i was feeling really weird , sicky and getting really bad headaches			2
i thought i was coming down with something			0
' it came on so slow that it became like a normal thing			0
' mrs @entity8 , a 44 - year - old singing teacher , said : ' if i had realised before he still would have had the cancer but the tumour would have been half the size if i had got there first			1
' his tumour was the size of a golf ball			0
he had two operations on it and then radiotherapy for six weeks alongside chemotherapy , followed by 48 weeks of combined chemotherapy			0
' he has been so strong but we are in our fifth week now since we were told the cancer had come back in may			0
' it means that next week is the sixth week which is usually the maximum time , so it will be a miracle if he can make it to his prom			2
' just last month we thought everything was alright , we had put the video on @entity14 just an hour before he had a @entity107 lesson			0
' he came home saying he could n’t see properly and could n’t remember anything			0
' when he had scans a few days later it showed the cancer had come back , in his brain and down his spine			0
' we sat there and @entity8 said ‘ no more treatment ’ , then he was very quiet , children accept it much better than grown ups			2
' instead , i felt like the child , it was horrible and very hard because what adults ca n’t deal with is them being so honest and accepting			0
' he ’s taken the bad news extremely well and has all the way through , which is typical @entity8 , when he has a terrible day he just says ‘ that ’s what it ’s like ’			2
' he ’s shown me how to cope , you think it would be the other way round but not at all , he is so strong			0
' day - to - day things are hard , he is deteriorating and is very upset that he ca n’t remember how to play his guitar , so he is spending time cooking and playing games with family			0
' symptoms of brain tumours			0

she is hoping to get small cards made by @entity151 , a charity promoting brain tumour awareness , in every school across the country , listing symptoms to look out for			1
she said : ' if i had known the symptoms i would have been able to get him to hospital about three weeks earlier			0
