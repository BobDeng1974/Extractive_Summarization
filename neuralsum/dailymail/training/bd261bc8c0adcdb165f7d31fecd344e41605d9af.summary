@entity0 laughs as he relays one of the moments that has made his move to @entity5 an @entity7 dream			1
enjoying a meal with friends in a restaurant near his new home , the player once of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , was tapped on the shoulder by a fan of his current club			1
dropping to his haunches then lying flat , arms outstretched , the supporter rolled along the floor unabashed as diners looked on bemused			2
@entity0 , though , appreciated the gesture			1
@entity0 is loving life with the @entity5 after his summer move from @entity14 @entity0 's ‘ @entity29 ’ goal celebration ( above ) has become famous across @entity30 the move is inspired by his brother ’s @entity33 team who asked @entity0 to showcase it during games ‘ the geezer ’s rolled down the whole length of the bar , ’ he recalls			1
‘ the manager , who knows us , had this towel and gets down on his knees to start cleaning up the floor			2
“ what are you doing ? ” i ask			2
“ he ’s just fallen over , ” he says			1
“ no , ” i explain			2
“ he was doing the @entity29 ! ” ’ after half a season of @entity51 , @entity0 is already famous in @entity30 , and wider , for a goal celebration that has been named in his honour			1
inspired by his brother ’s @entity33 team , he first produced it after scoring a buccaneering solo effort at @entity56 in august			1
there is more beside to give cause for his good mood as we chat over lunch in @entity62 on his return to @entity56 now the @entity51 season has finished			1
he is fresh from five months spent living in a wood cabin by a lake , where he can drive out his boat and relax under the sun till his heart ’s content			1
he has been playing in front of sell - out crowds boisterous from tailing - gating and discovering that @entity76 caters to his taste for bowler hats as well as @entity80			2
he is getting into fantasy football @entity7 - style too			2
in @entity83 , there are meetings to be had over his swimwear company and ahead lies a first @entity86 in 15 years celebrated with family and without football			2
having sold his @entity15 house he is back , aged 30 , with his parents at his childhood home , in @entity92 , @entity93			1
‘ it ’s lovely , ’ he says			1
‘ you wake up in the morning and there ’s a bacon sandwich and cup of tea ready			1
my brothers call it @entity102			2
’ that surname is used as less of a punchline when attached to his now trademark celebration – borne out of a transatlantic video - call with brother @entity107 as he enjoyed a @entity83 night out to toast the birth of his baby girl			2
@entity0 ( right ) tangles with @entity110 during his time at @entity16 during the 2006 season @entity0 ( left ) , pictured holding off @entity114 's @entity113 , spent five seasons at @entity116 @entity117 watches on as @entity118 united striker @entity119 winds up an audacious strike ‘ i was in the hotel before the @entity56 game and he ’s facetiming me while out on the p * * * with his mates , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ his whole @entity33 team do this log roll to celebrate goals			2
they ’re all shouting , “ make sure you do the log roll when you score ”			2
’ curiously , one of @entity76 ’s nicknames is @entity134 , owing to all the tress that needed to be chopped down in the 19th century to make way for a growing population			1
‘ it fits so well			2
our mascot is called @entity140 and when you score they cut a piece of log off and give it to you			0
’ soon becoming the @entity29 the move , which got another outing when he scored at home two weeks later , has taken off			0
he sees banners in the stands in tribute and fans send him clips of their own efforts			0
the goal that sparked it was something special			0
winning the ball just inside his opponent ’s half , @entity0 dribbled past two players , beat a third for pace and planted a left - foot finish into the net			1
‘ i ’m not the quickest in the world but i ’ve gone past him like @entity168 , ’ he says			0
‘ i scored one like it in a @entity171 testimonial for @entity16 when i was 19			1
no one has seen it			0
’ cameras caught this effort , preserved for eternity online			0
@entity0 is living in @entity7 partly because of a summer birthday party in @entity178			1
it was there , on the first day , he received a call from his agent telling him @entity5 were interested			1
@entity7 geography was not @entity0 ’s forte			1
‘ get a map , ’ he was told			0
‘ it ’s just 45 minutes north on a flight ’ ‘ that ’s probably the main part of why i visited , ’ admits @entity0			1
‘ they flew me out , picked me up , and drove me round			0
i was like , “ woah ”			0
’ @entity117 moved from @entity16 to @entity15 in 2007 and spent five seasons with the @entity192 @entity0 , in action for @entity15 , tries to chase down @entity195 winger @entity194 he was amazed by the stadium , training ground , and infrastructure of the club			1
then , when taken to @entity200 to sink a beer in scorching heat with manager @entity203 , he knew he had to take a leap made by few @entity206 players			1
‘ i was more or less sold there and then , ’ he says			0
‘ i just needed for my kids to agree to it			0
’ being nearly 5,000 miles away from @entity210 , who turned six in november , and @entity211 , turning nine on december 27 , was a dilemma			0
a meal with them and his ex , led to a solution			0
‘ they saw it more as an adventure			0
once they were fine , it was the easiest decision			0
my mum and dad brought them out for the whole of august			0
it was hard walking through the terminal when they went back , standing there crying			1
but i ’m out there playing football for them			0
’ @entity0 insisted on a place by the lake he had fallen in love with			1
‘ my back garden has decking , some steps , and then there ’s the lake , ’ he says			1
‘ you can go swimming and people have trampolines where you dive in			0
‘ i bought a speedboat , so of an evening instead of getting a train or a bus you sail out to the local restaurant			0
no parties as such , we ’ve had a couple of days out			0
you drop anchor , have a few drinks , sunbathe , muck about			0
‘ i want to go up into the woods , there are log cabins out in the middle of nowhere with infinity pools			0
i would never get that chance in @entity56			1
while i ’m out there i want to take it all in			0
’ @entity14 was @entity0 's next port of call in 2012 ; he spent two seasons with the @entity14 @entity0 ( right ) gets to grips with @entity269 's @entity268 at the @entity270 the city is to his liking as well			1
‘ a bit quirky , ’ says the man with tattoo sleeves on each arm and hair slicked back			1
‘ they have a nice hat store			0
i bought two bowler hats and three @entity282 flatcaps			0
‘ i finally found and little @entity206 shop called @entity285 ’s – after @entity285			1
they have @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity80 , crumpets			0
’ @entity0 has embraced @entity7 sport , doing well for a novice in the @entity294 ’s version of fantasy football			1
‘ i held the draft at my house			0
you get the board up , stick the players in the air			2
by the time you get to the end the last two or three picks are anyone , you ’ve had a drink			0
it ’s a good laugh and a good way to bond with the players			1
’ @entity0 is one of the club ’s designated players , earning substantially more than most at $ 1.2million ( £ 760,000 ) annually			1
salaries are available for all to observe online			0
‘ you ’re going in there as a designated player for a reason , so it ’s a little bit more pressure on you , ’ he says			1
‘ but as long as you ’re down to earth , people respect you no matter what you ’re earning			2
’ he thinks the @entity51 standard is roughly equivalent to high - end championship , lower - end @entity322 but predicts huge growth			1
‘ with more players , academy leagues and reserve leagues being set up , it will only get better			2
’ packed stadiums point to a bright future			0
‘ @entity76 have a five year waiting list for season tickets			1
we have 26,000 fans all singing together			0
the @entity7 go to the game to entertain us , they do n’t wait for us to entertain them			0
@entity0 ( back row , fourth right ) lines up for @entity340 ’s clash with @entity341 at @entity342 in february 2005 ‘ they get in an hour - and - a - half before kick - off and are jumping and having a great time			1
they ’ve done tail - gating beforehand ; flip down their hood , get out their barbeque , cook some hotdogs , drink beer			0
‘ the atmosphere is like a @entity357 v @entity356 game from back in the day			2
it ’s crazy , you ca n’t hear yourself play			2
people camp out for three days just to get a ticket			0
you see them sleeping on the street			0
’ it is more serene for @entity0 now , although there are meetings about his fledgling swimwear brand , @entity368 , alongside close friend @entity369 of @entity370			1
‘ it ’s been going for eight months , there are 13 collections already			2
’ he is looking to go on loan to a club in @entity83 during the winter window , before the @entity51 season starts up again in march			1
but is open to just relaxing			0
all the while he will tell ex-teammates who ask that crossing the @entity380 is a chance not to be missed			0
‘ since i ’ve gone , a lot of people have asked , “ what 's it like ? " once you know someone who ’s gone and done it , people think , “ i can do that			2
” i can definitely see more lads going out there			0
