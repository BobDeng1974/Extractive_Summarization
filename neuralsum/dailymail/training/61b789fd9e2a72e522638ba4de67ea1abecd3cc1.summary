a team of @entity2 legends managed to do what the @entity5 club 's current crop failed in doing - securing a draw against a @entity8 at the @entity9			1
the two @entity11 powerhouses have enjoyed some great @entity12 clashes down the years - and past heroes from both clubs were present in a 3 - 3 draw in a charity game at @entity8 's home - with @entity18 starring with two goals including a brilliant backheel			1
the former @entity22 frontman was reunited with his familiar striker partner @entity23 - and it seemed to pay dividends with @entity26 feeding the strike pair from midfield			0
@entity8 : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity44 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77			2
@entity65 set up @entity18 's opener with just nine minutes gone - putting in a low cross that the 42 - year - old was able to instinctively backheel past @entity68 in the @entity8 goal			0
@entity74 then scored an equaliser two minutes later , slotting past @entity61 as he sent the @entity84 ' keeper the wrong way as he was bearing down on goal			0
former @entity87 forward @entity77 then made it 2 - 1 to the home side , evading @entity89 's tackle in the area before providing the simplest of finishes and celebrating by rolling around in a sponsor 's sign behind the goal			0
@entity26 slotted home @entity23 's cutback to draw @entity2 level again before @entity76 beat the @entity22 offside trap to make it 3 - 2 to the home side			1
that set it up perfectly for @entity18 to seal the draw with another smart finish with just seven minutes remaining as the game ended 3 - 3			2
hero : @entity108 was player - manager of @entity2 and was n't afraid to go in for this meaty challenge on @entity8 's @entity111 late in the game not too serious : @entity63 and @entity89 joke around as they try to keep @entity8 's @entity74 on the floor to stop him from scoring again tough competition : @entity63 ca n't quite nick the ball with this challenge on @entity76 that saw him sent flying strange way to celebrate : @entity77 rolls up in a sponsor 's sign while @entity74 joins him in celebrating his goal that put @entity8 2 - 1 ahead in @entity47 not so friendly ! notorious tough tackler and @entity8 captain for the day @entity124 fouls @entity2 's @entity125 as he tries to make a breakaway from midfield all smiles : @entity74 looks like he enjoyed scoring his goal during the legends ' game at the @entity131 not up for another comeback @entity26 ? the @entity2 midfield hero holds his neck while @entity77 enjoys his goal for @entity8 quality : @entity62 comes away with the ball after a @entity23 challenge on @entity139 who looks to be struggling with the rigours of the game touch of class : @entity23 takes the ball away from @entity145 on the perfect turf at @entity8 's brilliant home ground familiar faces : the legends from both sides pose for a photograph ahead of the game at a busy @entity9 on saturday new boy : @entity154 was in action for the real @entity8 side as they had an open training session before the legends took to the field maestro : @entity162 was glad to be back alongside @entity26 in a @entity2 shirt for the first time in many years as they took on the @entity8 @entity166 sets @entity2 title target			1
