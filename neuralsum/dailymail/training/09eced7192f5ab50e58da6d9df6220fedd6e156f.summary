you spend half an hour putting on your make - up only to sweat it off , do your squats wrong so he 'll come adjust your pose and you 've spent a fortune on tight new gym gear			2
oh dear , fancy your personal trainer ? we 've all been there			2
and rumour has it , @entity12 has now got the hots for hers			2
but as one of @entity20 's top @entity19 reveals , as long as you 're training together , it 's best to keep things in the gym and out of the bedroom ... you ca n't deny @entity27 's a tasty dish , but @entity28 had to hold off until their gym sessions ended by @entity31 , director of lifestyle fitness @entity32 , lsfpt.co.uk and the @entity20 's leading trainer of @entity36			1
' during my many years in the business unfortunately i can recount many a tale of personal trainers becoming romantically involved with their clients , and an unsurprisingly 99 per cent of the time it does not end in a loving , lasting relationship			1
' if you do become attracted to your client , and vice versa , the only way to pursue it is to terminate the professional contract as soon as you realise you have developed feelings for the other person			1
' i first met my now partner , @entity28 ( @entity52 from @entity53 ) when i became her @entity36 ' it was only later , once we had finished training together that we pursued a personal relationship			1
i have no doubt that if we had continued our personal trainer and client relationship whilst embarking on something romantic , it would have failed on both counts			2
he has twelve years of personal training management experience behind him ' it 's such a cliché and any career - minded @entity36 would never cross that line at work so it 's really frustrating to see the latest headlines about personal trainer @entity71 allegedly ' finding romance ' with his client , @entity74 's @entity12			1
once again the actions of a minority threaten to undermine the credibility of our industry			2
' i have been in the personal trainer management business for 12 years and have trained over 1,000 individuals			1
' the average age is 26 and so it 's quite a young , vibrant industry but there is one very strict rule for every single person i train - ' no sex with clients ' - and anyone refusing to agree will be shown the door without exception			1
' in the capacity of personal trainer you are being entrusted with your client 's health and well - being , and to take advantage of that whilst they 're in your care is unacceptable			2
' if a patient started seeing their doctor or physician it would be at the very least frowned upon , and would no doubt cause outrage among his peers and other patients , yet it seems the same rules do n't apply to our industry			0
' there is a stigma around personal trainers and their female clients and there 's a tendency to treat it as a bit of a joke			1
but it 's something that not only breaks up marriages , but also casts our industry in a somewhat seedy light			0
i 've worked tirelessly in my career to drive up the credibility of personal training , but this type of behaviour playing out in the media with celebrities and their trainers totally undermines that			0
' the problem with so many male personal trainers having relationships with their clients is that it 's normally habitual - it becomes the way for them to meet women and the pattern ends up replaying itself over and over again			1
' the standing joke in one gym i know is that if you sign up for sessions with one particular trainer , you automatically sign up for an affair ! hat guy must have some angry husbands after him , not to mention the trail of ‘ heartbroken ' women he 's leaving behind			0
' but this is the problem			0
more often than not the relationship is being treated much more seriously by one party than the other			0
a sure sign of this is if the attraction is purely lust - driven and there is little to no romance or effort being made outside the gym			0
' of course , sometimes there will be more to it than just a spark of sexual chemistry and it may be that you have met your potential soul - mate in your @entity36 @entity27 lives with ex-client @entity52 ( @entity52 from @entity53 ) ' if this is the case the only way for a personal relationship to succeed is if it becomes genuine and the professional training contract is terminated immediately			1
the couple are then free to get to know each other as with any other potential partner and it removes any need for secrecy or deceit , which are not the foundations for a healthy partnership			1
' if the trainer is serious about the relationship he wo n't want to jeopardise either his career or a possible future with the client , so he will instigate a termination in the contract			0
' sadly though this rarely happens in my experience and it tends to be a fling , an affair or a fumble in the sunbed room or car park			0
' i have come across these types of affairs and they do typically end the same way - with the personal trainer coming to see me sheepishly asking for advice on how he can extricate himself from the situation , and the client is often left feeling humiliated			0
' so , why does it happen ? clients are attracted to the stereotypical fit - looking male personal trainer			1
typically he will lavish her with compliments about her body week in and week out			0
that attention often fills a gap - giving her the sort of attention that she might not be receiving elsewhere			0
before you know it , it 's turned into something romantic or sexual			0
' i operate a very strict policy in my organisation - the client and the client 's partner has to feel happy and reassured that the service is professional and focused on what it should be			1
if one of my personal trainers refuses to adhere to these rules , they are out			0
' twelve years of personal training management experience behind me and i believe my policy is the only option			2

@entity31 got together with ex-client @entity52 ( @entity52 , @entity53 )
couple soon hooked up and are now living together in @entity243
@entity245 for past 12 years
