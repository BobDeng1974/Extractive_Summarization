by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ in the weeks to come , it would be something special if it was @entity4 's turn to drool over @entity6 's audacious decision to take the kids to a @entity8			1
back in 2010 , when @entity4 humbled @entity10 4 - 1 in the second round , it felt like a young man 's tournament			1
three of @entity16 's forwards - @entity14 ( 23 ) , @entity17 ( 21 ) and @entity18 ( 20 ) - danced around @entity19 and @entity20 at the @entity21 in @entity22			0
aged 20 , @entity23 , now regarded as one of the best midfielders in the game , was on the substitutes ' bench			0
@entity29 ( 24 ) , @entity30 ( 26 ) , @entity31 ( 21 ) , @entity32 ( 25 ) taught @entity10 a lesson in possession			0
lesson in love : @entity18 celebrates with @entity17 ( left ) and @entity38 consoles @entity39 following @entity4 's 4 - 1 victory over @entity10 in the second round of the 2010 @entity8 on the ball : @entity43 competes for the ball with @entity45 during @entity4 's resounding 4 - 0 win it was shock and awe			1
they played without fear of reprisal , shredding @entity19 to pieces during an extraordinary afternoon for @entity55 football			1
@entity18 , who was later named the best young player at the tournament , scored twice			0
@entity6 will not be quite as cavalier , but it would be special if @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and , hopefully , @entity59 returned to similar acclaim			1
we know they have the talent , particularly after outstanding seasons with their clubs			0
now they have to make it happen and turn it to their advantage at the world 's biggest football tournament			2
many @entity10 fans are scarred by the performance under @entity79 four years ago and it is easy to forget what happened next to @entity16 's breathtaking team			0
a few days later @entity4 played even better when they destroyed @entity84 4 - 0 in the quarter - final with one of the most devastating performances in the history of the @entity8			1
in the semi-final , those young legs ran out of steam against the eventual champions , @entity93			1
in the build up to this year 's @entity8 , they have been talking with some conviction about winning it for a fourth time			1
low and his players really believe they can emulate the achievements of @entity102 ( 1954 ) , @entity103 ( 1974 ) and @entity104 ( 1990 )			0
they have a rich history at the @entity8 , winning three and losing four finals			2
they seem certain they will reach another			0
a few days ago @entity16 , @entity4 's charismatic coach , was pictured counting four fingers in recognition of the target			1
it was a bold thing to agree to do and not something you would expect to see from @entity10 's head coach @entity6			1
stats of the show : @entity4 put @entity84 to the sword in their thumping 4 - 0 victory back in 2010 on song : @entity4 's brilliant victory was one of the most devastating in the history of the @entity8 last week @entity126 spoke of the expectancy in @entity4 and the demand to win another @entity8			1
it feels like their time is coming			0
with @entity43 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity14 and @entity23 competing for a place in their midfield , they are a formidable team			0
a @entity8 in @entity138 is a true test for a team 's life cycle , particularly for any @entity143 team			2
let 's not forget that @entity93 , the reigning world and @entity143 champions , were beaten 3 - 0 by @entity138 in last summer 's @entity147 final in the @entity148			2
but @entity4 have an outstanding group of players and have had time to mature since 2010			2
they had another semi-final at @entity154 , before they were beaten by @entity156			2
the current crop already have course and distance			0
@entity6 has dipped his toe in the water with his squad , reaching out for some younger players as part of a plan to protect the future of the @entity10 team			2
the head coach has n't been quite as cavalier , but it is to be hoped that the younger players can still cause something of a stir against @entity156 on saturday			2
@entity173 man : @entity174 youngster @entity60 has impressed for @entity10 in training ahead of the @entity8 waiting in the wings : @entity61 , @entity177 and @entity62 could enhance their reputations @entity6 is realistic enough to know that the @entity181 heat - it was 35 degrees celsius on tuesday without taking into the account the humidity - will be a huge factor			1
he can not realistically expect @entity186 , at 34 , to make those lung - busting runs up and down the field in the opening game			0
instead the captain will be patrolling in front of the back four and asked to conserve energy and use his experience to bring some of the younger members of the squad in to play			0
@entity6 's plan is to win the ball back and then make sure that @entity186 and @entity199 give it to fresh young legs who can make an impact in the final third			1
they are in a tough pool of teams , but @entity4 lost one of their group games back in 2010 and it did n't hurt them			1
@entity10 's warm - up matches are no great indicators and it is far too early to start talking about the revolution of @entity55 football			0
for once , though , it would be nice to talk about a revelation .			0

@entity4 played without fear during an extraordinary afternoon in 2010
now it 's up to @entity60 , @entity224 to emulate that side
@entity6 's plan against @entity156 is to win the ball back and then give it to fresh young legs who can make an impact in the final third . it is sensible planning
@entity236 meanwhile , talking with conviction that they will win @entity8
