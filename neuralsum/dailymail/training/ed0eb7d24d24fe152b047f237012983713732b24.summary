by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:33 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 13:01 est , 18 october 2012 @entity2 was tonight scrambling to rescue his plan to force energy companies to give all their customers their cheapest deals , amid growing doubt about how it will work in practice			1
the prime minister arrived for talks with @entity12 leaders in @entity13 trying to clarify his announcement , after @entity15 earlier refused to confirm it would be included in the forthcoming @entity16			1
mr @entity2 insisted he wanted to be ' on the side of hard pressed , hard working families who often struggle to pay energy bills ' after opponents accused him of making up policy ' on the hoof '			2
@entity2 today toured a building site in @entity25 , central @entity26 , as @entity15 struggled to explain his announcement on energy bills the prime minister 's pledge to legislate ' so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers ' appears to be unravelling speaking at @entity28 's questions yesterday , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers			1
' but the new policy caught the @entity36 on the hop , and more than 24 hours later there was still no detail of how it will work			1
energy minister @entity41 was forced to appear in the @entity42 to explain the policy , but admitted he had not known mr @entity2 planned to make the announcement			1
he promised only to ' get people lower tariffs ' with ' different options ' still being considered			0
he added : ' this is a complicated area which will discuss with the industry , consumer groups and the regulator in order to work through the detail			1
' a number 10 spokeswoman later suggested the @entity16 would only ' put the obligation on the energy companies to offer the lowest tariffs to more people '			1
asked if she could guarantee that mr @entity2 's announcement would be included in the legislation , she added : ' we are looking at various options			2
' but arriving at a @entity13 summit today , mr @entity2 sought to clarify his announcement			0
he insisted : ' we are going to use the forthcoming legislation , the @entity16 coming up this year , so we make sure , we ensure , that customers get the lowest tariffs			1
' he also tweeted : ' i want to be on the side of hard working families			0
we 're going to use the energy bill to ensure customers get lowest tariffs			0
' @entity15 sources suggested the final policy would still allow choice between types of tariffs			2
one option being considered is that people on a variable tariff and pay by direct debit could be informed by their provider that they are going to be automatically switched to the lowest variable direct debit tariff from the same provider			0
customers would be able to opt - out of automatic switching			0
going up : the average annual dual - fuel bill is already at a record high of £ 1,300 and last week four energy companies announced above - inflation rises but the confusion has dismayed consumer groups who hoped real help would be offered to hard - pressed households			1
@entity98 , executive director of which ? , said : ' the prime minister must stick to the promise he made in @entity102 to legislate so energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers			1
' just giving people information on the lowest tariff is not enough when trust is at an all time low in the industry and switching levels are falling			0
which ? has been pressing the government for years to make sure people get a better deal so we must now see these words turned into action			2
" the average annual dual - fuel bill is already at a record high of £ 1,300 and last week four energy companies announced above - inflation rises			1
mr @entity2 said householders would no longer face a bewildering range of tariffs , which leave millions paying more than £ 100 a year too much for their fuel			0
often cut price introductory offers are used to get people to switch between companies but when they run out customers find themselves on much higher tariffs			0
it was suggested mr @entity2 's new policy would be written into the @entity16			2
but energy secretary @entity132 gave a major speech to the @entity134 this morning on how the legislation would make ' bills affordable ' , but made no mention of mr @entity2 's announcement			1
asked later about the surprise announcement , mr @entity132 said : ' making sure we have competitive markets and consumers face the lowest energy bills possible is a top priority for me			2
' energy minister @entity41 was forced to appear in the @entity42 to explain the prime minister 's announcement he suggested the government would only legislate for voluntary agreements secured earlier this year , under which the major energy firms would tell customers what the best available tariffs were			1
mr @entity41 was hauled before the @entity42 after speak @entity154 granted the @entity155 after a request from the @entity157			1
a @entity157 source said today : ' this is a policy unravelling by the minute			1
it says a lot about @entity2 's lack of attention to detail that they have got in this mess			0
' mr @entity41 was appointed as energy minister in last month 's reshuffle			1
earlier this year , @entity169 said the six biggest firms would write to customers once a year offering better tariffs after it emerged that 75 per cent of customers could be entitled to lower bills			0
mr @entity41 told @entity175 : ' we will use the @entity16 to get people lower tariffs and of course there are different options to be considered in the process			1
' but ms @entity183 , the shadow energy secretary , said mr @entity2 's announcement risked damaging the industry			0
' it caused chaos in the energy industry and i have to say it left his own ministers at a loss as to what energy policy actually is			0
' for the government to spend a day pretending they have a policy they have no intention of implementing is no way to run the country			0
it is like something out of @entity203			0
' @entity15 said yesterday the new law would put an ‘ obligation ’ on firms to put customers on the best deal to suit their circumstances			1
but in a further sign of the policy unravelling , the ' obligation ' today became an ' offer ' of lower tariffs			2
@entity215 branded the confusion an ' energy omnishambles '			2
executive director @entity218 said : ' the government ’s energy policy is now as confusing as @entity222 tariffs			2
even if what @entity2 announced yesterday was actual policy , it would fail to protect consumers from higher bills			2
until the government reduces our reliance on gas , the cheapest tariff will still be an expensive tariff			0
' mr @entity2 said householders would no longer face a bewildering range of tariffs , which leave millions paying more than £ 100 a year too much for their fuel @entity237 , director of consumer policy at price comparison website @entity240 , said she thought the announcement had been a ' mistake '			2
' the unintended consequences would be to kill competition			0
consumers will be left with @entity246 – there will be no spur , no choice , no innovation and no reason for consumers to engage any more			0
' research by price comparison @entity253 found that households can already save £ 135 by choosing a cheaper tariff from their supplier , or up to £ 300 by switching to a different supplier			0
annual bills have soared by an average of £ 200 since 2010 , despite the prime minister ’s ‘ energy summit ’ last year with the major companies			1
last week , @entity222 , npower , @entity266 and @entity267 announced rises of up to 9 per cent to be implemented before @entity269			1
the other two major energy companies , @entity271 and @entity272 , have yet to announce next year ’s increases			0
energy @entity274 , which represents the @entity276 companies , said it needed to know ' the detail of what 's being proposed by the prime minister and how this might impact our members ’ customers across the country '			1
' we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers ' prime minister @entity2 people who get discounts by paying online , not having paper bills or buying gas and electricity from the same supplier could see their bills rise , it was warned			1
@entity98 , executive director of consumer group which ? , wrote to mr @entity2 this week to say that the energy market was ‘ broken ’ and called for a review into the recent price rises			1
he said yesterday ’s announcement ‘ acknowledges that competition in the energy retail market has failed ’			0
changes : @entity183 mp , @entity157 's energy and climate change spokeswoman , said there is a need to ' completely overhaul our energy market to break the dominance of the big six energy companies ' @entity183 mp , @entity157 ’s shadow energy secretary , told @entity317 's @entity316 : ‘ the truth is , this policy is n’t going anywhere because the prime minister actually announced a policy that within 10 hours has disappeared			1
' we need transparency so we can see when the companies say " we ca n’t do this because we need to invest , " whether what they ’re saying is right and we need to know that when wholesale prices come down , they pass on those cuts to the consumers just the same way as they do when they go up			0
' ' we want all energy customers to have access to good value tariffs and assistance in reducing their bills ' @entity338 , @entity339 chief executive @entity338 , chief executive of @entity339 , which represents the industry , said : ‘ we want all energy customers to have access to good value tariffs and assistance in reducing their bills			2
‘ energy companies in @entity274 have already reduced the complexity of their offers and made them much clearer and easier to understand			0
‘ they have also contacted millions of households to offer help with insulation and to point out the discounts available			0
and there are more initiatives under way already to help consumers further			0

the *pm* promised to change law to make sure everyone gets the best deal
but 24 hours on @entity15 could not guarantee the idea will be in the @entity16 amid claims it could actually force some bills up
*commons* speaker @entity154 ordered energy minister @entity41 to appear at the @entity365 today to clear up the confusion
@entity222 , npower , @entity266 and @entity267 announced sharp price rises
@entity157 says the legislation plan is ' unravelling by the minute '
consumer groups say the prime minister must keep his promise
