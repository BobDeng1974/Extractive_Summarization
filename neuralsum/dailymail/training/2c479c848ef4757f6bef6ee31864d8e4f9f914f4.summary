by @entity0 published : 14:30 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 10:09 est , 3 november 2012 as @entity3 football star @entity2 raced towards the end zone there was nothing in front of him but his 12th touchdown of the season			1
so fans were all the more shocked when the @entity11 teen stopped only one yard from the end zone , and purposely stepped out of bounds			0
the only people who were n’t confused were his team - mates , who immediately understood that @entity2 had just sacrificed glory so that a teammate could honour his recently passed father			2
@entity21 ’s father , @entity20 , has suffered the stroke while unconscious in the bathroom as his sons got ready for school			1
@entity21 battered down the door with a baseball bat to get to him and the paramedics came , @entity20 was sadly pronounced dead at a local hospital			2
‘ in that instant , @entity21 stopped being a kid , ’ his mother , @entity41 , told @entity42			2
‘ he made grown - up decisions			0
in the blink of an eye his world changed and he went from being and adolescent to a young man			0
’ teammates : star player @entity52 knew how devoted @entity54 s family was to football and wanted to find a way to ease his teammate 's suffering before the visitation or the funeral , @entity21 had a football game to attend			1
though @entity21 typically spent his varsity games on the bench , he knew his father would ’ve wanted him to go			1
until the last quarter of the october 5 game , the time passed like any other game for @entity21 , supporting his team from the sidelines			1
unbeknown to @entity21 , the team ’s coach @entity69 had secretly urged his top players to stop short of the end zone if they had a chance , allowing grieving freshman a chance to final score			1
@entity52 : with only one yard to the end zone , @entity77 stepped out of bounds stopping the game and setting up @entity21 for his first touchdown the plan was almost foiled by two referees , who at first ruled that @entity77 had actually scored a touchdown			1
they finally relented after teammates came rushing on to the field to protest their own touchdown			0
as the team regrouped , @entity69 yelled for @entity21			1
‘ you ’re going in at running back , ’ @entity69 told him			0
‘ tell them to run 26 power			0
’ when the boy , a linebacker who only rarely played wide receiver , looked at his couch in shock , @entity69 offered some last words of encouragement before sending him on to the field			0
bench warming : @entity21 , a freshman who 'd never scored a touchdown , spent most games on the sidelines until his teammates executed their plan ‘ it ’s easy , ’ he said			1
‘ just follow @entity107 ’ big butt			0
’ on the next play @entity21 was given the ball and darted straight into the end zone through a five - yard gap between the right guard and tackle			2
‘ it felt like slow motion , ’ @entity21 told reporters			2
‘ i saw this humongous hole			0
i do n’t think our line has blocked this well all season			0
’ @entity2 went to @entity21 and hugged him			0
shocked : fans who 's never seen @entity21 's number 17 jersey on the field had no idea what to make of the last second entrant at one end zone @entity130 principal @entity129 broke down while at the other at the other @entity132 was wiping away tears			1
in the stands , @entity21 ’s brother , @entity135 , texted @entity41 : ‘ @entity137 , @entity21 scored a touchdown			1
