with @entity1 gripped by the @entity3 outbreak , experts are working around the clock to prevent the spread of the deadly disease			1
from the building of medical centres and tests at airports , to scientists working on diagnostic tests and a vaccine , the fight is underway to contain and treat the disease , which has killed more than 3,800 people so far			0
and now , the outbreak has been plotted on an interactive map , which details the world ’s most deadly outbreaks since 541 - when plague struck @entity22 and beyond			1
the first outbreak to be mapped is the @entity37 of 541 and 542			1
it ravaged areas of modern - day @entity22 , @entity1 , and @entity41 , killing 5,000 people a day at its peak			1
@entity45 - the organism responsible for the @entity46 afflicted the @entity47			2
people suffering from the illness complained of fevers , headaches , fatigue , necrosis - the death of body tissue – and the swelling of the lymph nodes , especially in the area of the armpit or groin			1
the first outbreak to be seen on the map is the @entity37 of 541 and 542			1
it ravaged areas of modern - day @entity22 , @entity1 , and @entity41 , killing 5,000 people a day at its peak the map also shows how the @entity65 of 1346 to 1350 rocked @entity22 , the @entity66 , @entity41 and northern @entity67			1
it killed approximately two thirds of infected humans within just four days			0
a more targeted outbreak struck in 1665 , known as the @entity72			2
the outbreak killed an estimated 100,000 people , approximately 15 per cent of @entity76 's population at the time			2
it was caused by the yersinia pestis bacterium , which is usually transmitted through the bite of an infected rat flea			0
a more targeted outbreak struck in 1665 , known as the @entity82 of @entity83 killed an estimated 100,000 people , about 15 per cent of @entity76 's population at the time			1
it was caused by the yersinia pestis bacterium , which is usually transmitted through the bite of an infected rat flea no - one knew what was causing the plague ( illustrated ) so @entity91 used superstitious measures to protect themselves , such as wearing lucky charms no - one knew what was causing the plague , so @entity91 used superstitious measures to protect themselves			2
these included wearing lucky charms , taking quack cures , such as ' powdered unicorn horn ' and using chicken feathers to draw the poison out of the body			0
more practical measures , such as placing money in bowls of vinegar to avoid the transmission of the disease and smoking tobacco - as suggested by the @entity110 - were also used to try and prevent the spread of the plague			2
the map shows that the @entity114 of 1829 to 1851 affected most of the northern hemisphere			1
this pandemic began , like the first , with outbreaks along the @entity118 in @entity119			1
from there the disease spread along trade routes to @entity67 , @entity22 and @entity122 in 1829 , lasting 20 years			1
symptoms included vomiting , dehydration and diarrhoea			2
the disease is thought to have killed over 100,000 people			0
the @entity130 coincided with the end of the @entity132 and struck worldwide			2
it was a one of the worst influenza pandemics in history , killing at least 75 million people between 1918 and 1923 globally			0
symptoms included fever , chills , headache , sneezing , a sore throat and fatigue			1
the map also shows more recent outbreaks , such as @entity145 , ( @entity145 ) which struck in 2002			1
it started in @entity147 and spread throughout @entity67 over a 12 - month period , killing around 775 people			2
@entity3 has so far proved more deadly than @entity145 , killing more than 3,800 people			1

smallpox ( pictured ) is the biggest killer and has been responsible for 500 million deaths the map was made when fatalities totalled 3,069 , at of september this year , and the figures were taken from data from the @entity179 ( @entity179 ) , the @entity180 ( @entity180 ) , media outlets and @entity182			0

it started in @entity147 and spread throughout @entity67 in a 12 - month period , killing around 775 people many measures were taken to prevent the rapid spread of @entity145			1
here , schoolchildren in @entity232 wear compulsory face masks			0
people found to harbour the disease were isolated and treated with antipyretics and oxygen bubonic plague – also known as the @entity65 , killed between 30 and 60 per cent of the @entity22 population in the 14th century - and 75 million people in total			1
@entity242 is the fifth deadliest disease in human history and has been responsible for approximately 40 million global deaths			0

the outbreak has a mortality rate of around 50 per cent			0
this scene shows bodies being taken away in @entity266 more than 750 @entity268 military personnel and a medical ship will be deployed to @entity270 to help fight the @entity3 epidemic			1
the ship , @entity273 , which has a fully - equipped hospital including critical care and high - dependency units , will be sent to @entity266 in a bid to stop @entity3 from spreading , as other preventative measures are being put in place			1
the affected areas of @entity1 are shown on the map			1

interactive map shows the reach of diseases , as well as death tolls and their symptoms , such as fever and rashes
it details the world 's most deadly outbreaks since 541 - when the @entity37 struck @entity22 and beyond
@entity295 also includes modern outbreaks , such as @entity145 , the flu pandemic of 2009 and most recently , @entity3 in @entity1
