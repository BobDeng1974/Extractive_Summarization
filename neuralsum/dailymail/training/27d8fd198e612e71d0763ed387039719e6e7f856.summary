endless flights of swans who arrive here because they think our dark and chilly island is the most blissful place on earth @entity8			1
a good word : a great spectacle			0
@entity11 after swan after swan , falling from the wintry sky as if cold were the most blessed thing in the world			0
it ’s one of the greatest sights that @entity19 can offer : endless flights of swans who arrive here because they think our dark and chilly island is the most blissful place on earth			1
human observers may feel the cold bite into the marrow of their bones as temperatures plummet this week , but for these swans it ’s like landing on the beach in @entity34			1
and their first job is to get their towels on the sun - loungers			0
so the birds sort themselves out : who is the most important , who gives way to whom			1
it ’s a family thing : they go at it in gangs of up to half - a - dozen , united in purpose			0
parents and the offspring they have raised that year fly in from the @entity51 together , so no wonder they find our winter balmy			1
they return to traditional sites , and once they have made their descent to the lake — water - skiing in on big black feet — they settle the question of dominance			2
family groups will have face - offs with each other			0
no fighting : just a noisy demonstration of strength : synchronised neck - waving while making a noise like a bugle			0
numbers matter : a family of six will force a family of four to back down , but there are other factors , some of them unclear even to the most clued - up observer			0
once the league table is sorted out , they co-exist amicably and socially , so long as no one crosses the line			0
they hang out together all winter , often foraging in fields by day before returning to the lake when dusk falls in mid-afternoon — a luxuriously long day by the standards of an @entity51 winter			2
the noise , the honking and the bugling , fills the skies as the birds come in on their evening flight : proud - looking , stiff - necked birds with great yellow beaks , dramatically unlike the swans that we have with us all year			1
these are whooper swans and @entity102 ’s swans : often collectively referred to as wild swans			2
we tend to measure the wild winter by the birds that fly south in the autumn to escape the chill , such as swallows and swifts , cuckoos , warblers and nightingales			1
but for plenty of birds , @entity19 in winter is a haven of warmth and shelter and food			1
we ’re an island , and that ’s of great relevance to our shifting population of birds			2
the @entity125 ocean current keeps our weather milder than the rest of continental @entity128			0
meanwhile , what could be more @entity130 than a blackbird ? you ’ll see plenty			0
but a closer look will tell you a rum thing : they all seem to be cock birds			2
the females are browny and dull - looking : only the males are black with those banana - coloured beaks			0
you wonder how there could be enough females for them when it ’s spring and time to breed			0
but many of them are n’t @entity19 in the sense of being hatched here , breeding here and living here all year round			1
a lot of those you see in winter breed in @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and the @entity158			2
they come here to escape the continental winter			2
the females tend to fly further south , to winter in warmer places than @entity19 , places where the food supply is more certain			1
but for the males , the closer they are to the breeding - grounds , the earlier they can get back			0
for the cock blackbirds in your garden , the waders on the estuary and the swans who take over the lake , @entity19 in winter is a subtropical paradise the earliest birds get the best territories and defend them by singing to stake their claim			1
by the time they ’ve done so , the females make their leisurely way back , ready to meet a great blackbird with an inviting spread of territory and the sexiest singing voice in the neighbourhood			0
so the male birds ’ winter stay in @entity19 is , in fact , a kind of extended stag weekend			1
here ’s a way to understand what winter really means			2
wrap up well this week and take a walk along a river estuary			2
our island has hundreds of them , and they tend to be the bleakest places on earth , hence the need for at least one more layer than you think physically possible			0
but it ’s here you can look for birds that come in their thousands to revel in the comparative kindness of our climate and in the abundant food on offer			2
the mud exposed by the outgoing tide is covered with long - legged birds that paddle and poke their beaks into this gloopy silt in search of the millions of wormy creatures that live there			0
but you can also savour the joys of winter just by looking through the window at a garden or from the car as you pass a park			1
that @entity130 robin that seems to have hopped from a @entity231 card may be a @entity157 : continental birds fly through @entity19 in the autumn on their way to somewhere warmer , and a good few of them decide to go no further			1
then there are the winter thrushes : birds we see only in the colder months			1
if it wears a lavish eyebrow it ’s a redwing , if it flies away and shows you a black tail — clucking a little like a chicken — it ’s a fieldfare			0
both thrushes breed in @entity155 and @entity157 and come here for winter holidays			0
but perhaps the best tip for winter birding is to go to supermarket car parks			1
they are the ideal habitat for one of the most dashing winter visitors of them all : birds that look raffish and a shade disreputable			1
they ’re waxwings , unpredictable birds that arrive sometimes in ones and twos , more often in small groups , sometimes in decent - sized flocks			1
and like planners of supermarkets : they ’re mad for berries			0
supermarket car parks tend to be planted with low - maintenance , berry - laden cotoneasters , and waxwings often descend on them			1
or they will take a fancy to a suburban street , one on which the householders share their taste for berries , and hang out for a day or a week			0
there are times when @entity19 feels like an @entity51 wasteland , at least to those of us who live here			1
but some of our visitors see the place in a different way			0
for the cock blackbirds in your garden , the waders on the estuary and the swans who take over the lake , @entity19 in winter is a subtropical paradise			1
even in winter , our island — the wild parts that remain — represents the future , hope , and life .			0

every year , birds flock to @entity19 to settle in lakes and river estuaries
for swans , blackbirds and waders , our winter offers a balmy paradise
waxwings are also found in supermarket car parks and suburban streets
