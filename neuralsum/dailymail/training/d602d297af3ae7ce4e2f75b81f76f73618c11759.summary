doctors could be misdiagnosing up to a third of suspected cases of @entity3			1
professor @entity4 said many of those thought to be suffering from chronic fatigue are in fact suffering from postural tachycardia syndrome or @entity10			1
unlike @entity3 , this condition can be treated with a variety of medications and doctors suggest lifestyle changes can help as well			1
suspected errors : experts believe doctors could be misdiagnosing up to a third of suspected cases of me @entity3 , which affects around 250,000 people in the @entity21 , has long proved difficult for doctors to diagnose			1
in the absence of a reliable clinical test , they often rely on detecting symptoms such as tiredness , mood swings and memory problems			1
but professor @entity4 , from @entity31 ’s institute for ageing and health , said around 80,000 me sufferers may have @entity10			0
around 110,000 people are thought to be affected by @entity10 , which involves an abnormality in the nervous system			2
also difficult to diagnose , it can be treated with a range of medication including beta blockers			1
‘ i would think that around one third of people with chronic fatigue syndrome , if they were properly tested , would have @entity10 , ’ professor @entity4 told the @entity42			1
last year former @entity48 actress and love actually star @entity46 spoke about the seven years of her life she has lost to the illness ‘ @entity10 is an abnormal response of the nervous system , but it is a spectrum , so some people will feel dizzy on standing , while others will actually black out			2
it affects the part of the nervous system that is actually outside our control			0
’ her team studied 52 @entity10 sufferers from an @entity64 clinic , who were diagnosed between 2009 and 2012 , and 84 people from the @entity10 @entity21 charity			1
they found that young , well - educated females were the most likely to suffer from the syndrome			0
as with @entity3 , scientists and doctors have struggled to find a definitive cause of @entity10 , but professor @entity4 believes it is caused by hormonal changes or a virus			1
@entity3 , which stands for myalgic encephalomyelitis , is slightly more common in women than men			2
those severely affected are often bedbound due to their extreme fatigue , with scientists and doctors long puzzled by the disorder ’s cause			0
it was once thought of as a disorder of the mind , referred to as the ‘ yuppie flu ’ by some sceptics			0
other experts have claimed it is caused by a virus or is genetic in origin			0
because it is so difficult to diagnose , doctors usually classify it as sudden tiredness lasting more than six months that is not explained by another illness , exercise or hard work			1
previous studies have suggested that three quarters of me sufferers have lost their job because of the condition and 2 per cent can not leave their homes			0
@entity107 , chief executive of the charity @entity108 , told the @entity109 last night : ‘ the findings are really interesting			0
we know that misdiagnosis is a big issue and are aware of the association with @entity10			0
‘ gps and other healthcare professionals regularly tell us about the difficulty in they have in diagnosing me and the need for much more research into and education about the nature of @entity3			2
’ as there is no cure for @entity3 , patients are given treatments including painkillers for muscle ache and behavioural therapy and exercise therapy			2
they are often advised to avoid alcohol , caffeine , sugar and sweeteners in case they make their symptoms worse			0
