on a bright , spring morning in 1991 , a young doctor made an emergency visit to a new patient on @entity5 ’s monied @entity4			0
he rode up to the eighth floor in a mahogany - panelled elevator with a uniformed doorman who admitted him to a murky 40ft hallway			0
a single candle lit paintings by @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			0
in the gloom , dr @entity17 came face - to - face with a frail and frightened woman in a soiled bathrobe			0
untreated cancers had eaten away the left part of her lower lip and right cheek			2
deep ulcers beneath her right eye exposed her orbital bone			0
cut off from the world : @entity31 chose to spend the last twenty years of her life in a hospital room at 85 , @entity31 had outlived her favourite doctors and had n’t dared trust anybody new until she felt close to death			1
dr @entity17 sent her straight to @entity39 ’s @entity38			0
and though she made an excellent recovery , she never returned to her regal quarters — or to her lavish mansions in @entity43 and @entity44 — preferring to spend the next 20 years and two months in a cell - like room overlooking the hospital ’s industrial air - conditioning unit			2
this fascinating biography by journalist @entity50 and @entity52 ’s nephew @entity51 never really gets to the bottom of this exceptionally healthy and wealthy woman ’s strange decision to spend her last two decades in minimalist medical seclusion			1
but it tells a gripping rags - to - riches tale of the heady accumulation and weird dispersal of one of @entity63 ’s greatest fortunes — allowing readers a good gawp through the gilded keyhole , before reassuring them that too much gold can turn life pretty cold			2
@entity31 was the daughter of @entity70 : a red - whiskered entrepreneur who was born in a @entity72 log - cabin			1
he turned his first significant profit in the 1860s , selling supplies to gold - rush prospectors , but made his big bucks in mining just as copper was becoming the essential conductor of modern life — used in the new telegraph cables , light bulbs and full metal jacket bullets			0
by the early 1900s , he may well have been the wealthiest man in @entity63 , for while oilman @entity85 had more cash in the bank , the ‘ @entity90 ’ had more assets under the ground			1
the question this book poses is : did his vast wealth leave his family a poisonous legacy ? while his contemporary @entity96 believed life should be divided into three stages , namely education , making money and giving it away , @entity70 never reached that third stage			1
when he died in 1925 , he left an estate estimated at $ 100 - $ 250 million ( $ 3.4 billion , or £ 2 billion today ) and only $ 600,000 to charity			1
the rest went to family , with one fifth going to his youngest child , 18 - year - old @entity107			0
the second daughter of @entity70 ’s second marriage — to a 28 - year - old @entity110 when he was 67 — @entity52 ( pronounced ooo - get ) was born in @entity111 but raised in the largest house in @entity5 : 121 rooms for the family of four			1
the @entity90 : @entity107 and her father , @entity115 - one of the wealthiest men in @entity63 in the 1900s - pictured in 1912 the little girls raced up and down the white marble staircase , played hide - and - seek among the marbled columns leading to the sculpture hall , sat beneath its 36ft octagonal dome and hurtled past the @entity123 ’ pottery collection ( painted with brushes made of mouse whiskers ) to the music of a cathedral - scale organ			1
they were only forbidden to run in the @entity129 , decorated with oak from @entity131 and a clock from @entity134 ’s boudoir			0
@entity107 ’s older sister @entity135 was the more outgoing of the two but died suddenly of meningitis just before her 17th birthday , leaving a diary that revealed she ’d been unhappy in her gilded cage until she ’d been allowed to join the @entity140 at 16			0
she wrote : ‘ scouting has been a hand in the dark to me			0
it has changed me from a moody , thoughtless girl , and has shown me what life may be			0
’ a fairy castle doll 's house built by @entity149 costs £ 4.1million bereft of her beloved sister , @entity52 ’s introversion increased			1
she never joined the @entity140 , and flummoxed classmates — who could n’t work out if she was arrogant or embarrassed by her father ’s political scandals and social climbing			0
after his death , she stayed at home with her kind but reserved mother , talking in @entity110 so that friends and servants would n’t understand them			1
then , even her mother was shut out as @entity52 ’s passion for painting and dollhouses grew			1
although attractive , @entity107 showed little interest in men			0
there might have been a crush on an art teacher — and she was married , at 22 , to the son of her father ’s accountant			1
but the union , possibly arranged by her mother , lasted only nine months			2
her family suspected she was unwilling to consummate her vows , while others speculated she was just too caught up in her art. as paintings sold at @entity182 ’s last month reveal , @entity107 was a talented artist , excelling with oils at a time when women were expected to stick to pastels			0
recluse : @entity107 spent her final decades in a tiny hospital room , watching @entity189 on tv whatever the truth of it , she continued to write to her ex-husband using the same polite - but - distant tone she used with almost everybody			1
from @entity135 ’s death until her own , @entity52 ’s closest and most enduring attachments appear to have been with her dolls			1
she lavished all her time and money on them — commissioning $ 80,000 dollhouses and @entity204 doll dresses while ignoring pleas for funds from an orphanage founded by her father			2
as she grew older , she treated her real houses like toys , insisting the table remained set for her at the @entity44 estate she did not visit in more than 50 years , and turning her @entity5 bedroom into an exact replica of her mother ’s			2
although this book makes a compassionate and psychologically subtle effort to rescue the heiress from the reductive clichés of reclusive eccentricity , her life still reads as sad and stunted			0
despite an incredible property portfolio and remarkable good health , a woman worth $ 300 million spent her final decades in a tiny hospital room , leafing through snapshots of her @entity227 dolls and watching @entity189 on tv			1
she also doled out more than $ 31 million in gifts to a dedicated but arguably unethical nurse , while the family ’s lawyers circled			2
it is telling that @entity52 ’s favourite fairy tale was @entity234			2
she commissioned many dollhouses to act out the story			0
but with a lifelong suspicion that people were only after her money , the @entity90 ’s daughter spent her life building her own prison towers , and never dared let down her hair .			1

after his death , @entity52 remained inside , talking to no one but her mother
