by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 they say the referee has had a good game if he has not been noticed and many times this season , that was true			2
however , inevitably there were decisions which put the referee in the spotlight , usually for the wrong reasons			0
these were the season 's five most contentious incidents ... @entity12 sent off @entity14 's @entity13 instead of @entity15 at @entity16 in march 2014 after the winger handled the ball to stop what he thought would have been a goal for the hosts			1
mix up : @entity12 sends off @entity13 ( third left ) for @entity15 's handball @entity23 allowed @entity16 ’s goal against @entity25 when @entity26 kicked the ball away from @entity25 keeper @entity28 when he was in the process of clearing it upfield			1
the ball is considered within the control of the goalkeeper even when he throws it from his hand to drop kick it			0
@entity38 awarded @entity39 a penalty against @entity41 for a @entity43 challenge on @entity44 which was clearly outside the area			1
not spot on : @entity38 awarded a penalty for this foul by @entity43 on @entity44 despite the fact it was outside the area @entity50 disallowed @entity52 's perfectly good goal against @entity53 for offside by ruling that @entity55 had got a slight touch on the ball when he had not			1
a player must touch the ball to be considered to be interfering with play			0
@entity50 was then affected for the rest of the game and badly misjudged @entity64 ’s shocking challenge on @entity65 which should have been a red card – perhaps the worst of the season			1
assistant referee @entity67 made two wrong calls in @entity70 ’s defeat by @entity53			2
firstly he indicated a foul and a penalty when @entity73 clearly played the ball when challenging @entity75 and was wrongly dismissed			0
he then flagged for offside and had a perfectly good goal @entity79 goal disallowed - both helped @entity25 to victory			2
disallowed : but this @entity79 goal for @entity70 against @entity53 should have stood @entity83 publicly criticising @entity12 and apologising on his behalf to @entity85 manager @entity84 after @entity12 awarded @entity16 a penalty after @entity87 dived			1
@entity88 was clearly wrong and was ‘ conned ’ by the @entity89 dive it ca n’t be good for an individual referee to be highlighted by his boss – team managers would not do it			0
@entity95 - who is the best natural referee who can get the most out of a game with his approach and attitude towards advantage			1
once again controversy followed him with ' @entity101 ' this season after the race allegations from ' @entity104 ' from last season			2
he survives because he is so good on the field but needs to take care that he does n’t push the friendly approach too far			0
official no 1 : @entity95 has been the best referee in the country this season 2			1
@entity111 - who matures with every performance			2
refereeing the @entity114 derby , @entity116 ’s 5 - 1 demolition of @entity14 and the @entity117 without problems shows great development			2
he will be no 1 it ’s just a case of when			0
@entity122 - continues to perform consistently well in the big games despite coming off the @entity125 list at the end of 2013 due to age restrictions			2
@entity14 v @entity16 and @entity53 v @entity16 went well			0
even @entity129 congratulated @entity122 after losing to @entity130 ! refs can never please everybody			0
@entity133 - returned to good form and was rewarded with a lot of key appointments – refereeing the @entity116 vs @entity16 game with huge common sense was his highlight for me as this game perhaps affected the title more than others and went without a single issue			1
reward : @entity133 ( left ) has been given key matches , while @entity147 will go to the @entity148 5			1
@entity147 - had a really interesting season – fantastic in @entity150 but indecisive in @entity152 games			1
he has the @entity148 finals to officiate at and then a summer of reflection and perhaps retirement			0
whatever you think of him he would be sorely missed for his presence on a list short of quality in depth			0
@entity23 – recovered after a poor start and is a solid and safe referee for most @entity152 games			1
@entity164 – steady referee whose experience gets him through most games			0
@entity168 – started the season in great form helped by his huge weight loss last summer			1
as the weight has gone back on the performances have dipped – refereeing is about fitness and positioning			2
not fit enough : @entity168 , here sending off @entity177 , has seen his form dip as his weight increased 9			1
@entity12 – a real mixed bag from @entity12 who gaffed with the @entity183 dismissal and the @entity87 penalty against @entity85			1
still a good referee but not his best season			0
@entity187 – had the pleasure of sending @entity189 off for that butt but appears to have lost the support of the @entity192 to handle any big games			0
from 1 - 14 june , @entity0 will be doing a charity bike ride			0
to find out more and donate go to : @entity195			0

@entity12 sent off @entity13 , should have been @entity15
likes of @entity23 and @entity38 have also erred
referees ' chief @entity83 has not covered himself in glory
@entity95 has been the *standout* official in the top - *flight*
@entity168 's form has dropped as he has gained weight
@entity147 has been *suspect* *domestically* but *excellent* in @entity150
@entity50 made possibly the worst call of the season
