gasping for fresh air as she was pulled out alive from the ruins of a clothing factory 17 days after it collapsed around her , worker @entity0 was hailed as ‘ the miracle woman ’			1
now the seamstress , whose extraordinary survival story made headlines around the world last month , is accused of being part of a massive hoax			1
miss @entity0 was dramatically discovered among the tangled steel and concrete of the @entity15 garment factory , where clothes were manufactured by suppliers for high street brands including @entity19			1
but a co-worker is now accusing the 19 - year - old of faking the length of time she had been trapped in the ruins , and being part of a hoax by the authorities to make up for the bad publicity following the disaster , in which 1,221 people died and about 2,500 were injured			1
the male co-worker told local journalists that she had in fact escaped from the eight - storey @entity47 building in @entity48 , @entity49 , on the day it came down , scrambling from the rubble alongside him			1
the man told local journalists : ‘ we escaped together			2
we both walked away from the rubble			0
we spent two days in hospital but then she vanished			0
the next time i saw her was on tv 17 days later			2
they said it was a miracle , but it was a fake			0
’ @entity0 and her family 's lives have been transformed since the accident			2
she now has a lucrative job at a luxury hotel miss @entity0 told local television – in an interview beamed around the world – how she had managed to survive those long days by eating leftover food she found in fellow workers ’ lunch boxes and drinking water dribbling from a broken pipe			0
it was reported at the time that she had been trapped under a concrete slab but stayed alive thanks to an air pocket left by a @entity80 prayer room in the basement			0
she was photographed being carried on a stretcher from the ruins of the building on may 10 , her face and clothes covered in white dust			2
but miss @entity0 ’s landlady told journalists from @entity49 ’s pro-opposition newspaper @entity91 she had escaped from the building on the same day it had collapsed and had received treatment at the nearby @entity95 hospital			1
it is now being claimed that in order to cover up the hoax , people living near the factory were curiously forced to move out of their homes the day before the young woman ’s ‘ rescue ’			1
they were allowed back once she was ‘ saved ’			0
to add to the mystery , police imposed a 24 - hour ban on filming of the continuing rescue operation			1
investigative journalists have also questioned miss @entity0 ’s apparently ‘ good condition ’ for someone who had supposedly spent 17 days trapped in the ruins of a building			1
‘ she said she had to claw her way through bricks and debris to reach water in dead victims ’ rucksacks but her hands and fingernails did not show the marks you would expect , ’ said @entity113 , a local journalist			0
investigators claim miss @entity0 's appearance and injuries in the famous pictures are not consistent with 17 days trapped under rubble collapse : the building housed factories that made low - cost garments for @entity135 brands			1
authorities vowed to clamp down on unsafe working practices in the wake of the disaster ‘ also , her eyes were wide open when they pulled her out and she did not appear to be sensitive to the bright sunlight			0
her sari was not ripped or torn and appeared clean			0
‘ people were suspicious but the government made a huge fuss of hailing it as a miracle			2
’ miss @entity0 , who has since been ‘ awarded ’ with a £ 600 - a - month job at a luxury hotel in @entity49 , hit back angrily at the accusations			1
‘ where i was , you were not there , so you have no idea , ’ she said			0
her mother , @entity157 , who says she is thankful that because of her daughter ’s courage the family have a new life , insisted : ‘ her escape is the miracle everyone thinks it is			0
’ the @entity15 army , which led the search , rescue and body - recovery operation , has yet to respond to claims of a hoax			1
when the @entity47 factory building crashed down in april , 1,129 people were killed			2
many of those freed are still @entity175 with no medical training were forced to perform amputations on the spot to free them without anaesthetic			0
@entity15 's government and garment manufacturers are campaigning to close dangerous factories and to make safety a priority for the country 's most valuable export industry			1
@entity15 garment factories are routinely built without consulting engineers			1
many are located in commercial or residential buildings not designed to withstand the stress of heavy manufacturing			0
some add illegal extra floors atop support columns too weak to hold them , according to a survey of scores of factories by an engineering university that was shown to @entity201			0
a separate inspection , by the garment industry , of 200 risky factories found that 10 per cent of them were so dangerous that they were ordered to shut			2
the textiles minister said a third inspection , conducted by the government , could show that as many as 300 factories were unsafe .			0
