by @entity0 published : 11:37 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 13:28 est , 17 december 2012 as a former winner of @entity5 and with her own cookery book to her name , tv star @entity2 's passion for good food is well - documented			2
now the 48 - year - old , who had crept up to a dress size 18 three years ago , has told how she managed to slim down to a shapely size 12 without succumbing to a ' depressing ' fat - free diet or even forgoing her beloved wine and cream cakes			1
thanks to simply cutting out snacking and taking a more calorie - conscious approach to cooking , the presenter has gone from struggling to look at herself in the mirror , to being snapped up as the confident and curvaceous star of @entity21 's latest ad campaign			1
' thrilled ' : face of @entity23 in her favourite piece from the collection , a @entity27 red pleated dress by @entity28 , £ 35 ' my philosophy is that you should n't go without anything , ' she told @entity33			0
but three years ago the 5ft6in tv presenter decided it was time to take action when her weight hit 13stone			0
body confident : @entity2 - who has fluctuated between a dress size 8 and 18 - says she feels comfortable and confident as a size 12 ' i was in denial about how big i was - i could n't look at myself straight on in mirrors and whenever i appeared on tv i was always the biggest , ' said the former @entity44 panellist , who said by the time her family sat down to eat the meals she prepared for them she was already full from grazing on the wrong type of foods			1
instead of cutting out all the foods she enjoys in favour of low - fat options , @entity2 made sure to only eat when she was hungry , and measured out the oil she used in cooking with a spoon rather than pouring it freely into the pan			0
' i cooked the same things , i just tried to cut the calories , ' she said			0
' flattering ' : @entity2 models a wine velvet sleeveless dress , left , £ 35 , and a @entity28 rose printed blouse , £ 15 , and black trousers , £ 19.50 , right , all from @entity21 introducing exercise into her daily routine also helped to transform the star into the happy and healthy size 12 vision that caught the attention of @entity21			1
' when my agent called and said i 'd been asked to be the face of @entity21 my first question was what size do they want me to be - when he replied " they have n't asked what size you are they just want you " , i could have cried , ' she said			1
' having been every size in the past from an 8 to an 18 and now finally being happy in my skin at size 12 - which is the right size for me long term - to actually be modelling at the grand old age of 48 seemed crazy			0
but i 'm absolutely thrilled to bits and i love all the clothes , which are cut to fit and flatter the female form			0
' ' @entity21 loves bums and boobs which is perfect for me because i love being a woman with curves but still taking care of my diet and body so i can be fit and healthy for my family - right now i 'm having the time of my life , ' she said .			2
