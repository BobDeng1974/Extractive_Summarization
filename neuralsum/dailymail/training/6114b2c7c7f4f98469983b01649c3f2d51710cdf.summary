by @entity0 published : 05:36 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:39 est , 6 december 2013 an elderly couple who told neighbours they did not want to move into a care home have been found dead after apparently jumping from a block of flats			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , both in their early 90s , were discovered at the foot of the apartment building in @entity13 , @entity14 , where they were housebound			1
it is believed that they told neighbours of concerns about being put a home the night before their bodies were found by an assistant caretaker at @entity22 , a seafront apartment building			1
the previous evening the frail couple , both in their early 90s and said to be housebound , said they did not want to have to go into a care home			1
death : @entity8 and @entity9 , who are in their 90s , were found dead outside this block of flats in @entity13 the couple , who are thought to have two sons , lived on the second floor of the building and are thought to have fallen around 30ft to their deaths			1
an ambulance crew rushed to the apartment block but the pair were pronounced dead at the scene and police are not treating the deaths as suspicious			1
neighbour @entity45 , 83 , said : ' they were an elderly married couple who suffered from poor health in recent years			1
he lost his eyesight altogether about two years ago			2
' it must have happened some time during the night because nobody in the flats saw or heard anything			1
someone realised what had happened when they looked outside at about 8am			2
' their bodies had been covered up and then the police and ambulance arrived , taped off the area and took them away			2
tragedy : the elderly couple are believed to have killed themselves to avoid having to live in a care home ' they lived on the second floor but it was n't an accident			1
they were elderly people and it would have been an effort to climb over the railings of the balcony			2
' in the last five years they came out less and less as their health worsened			2
the husband always held on to his wife when they were out walking			0
' another neighbour , @entity81 , said : ' i did n't know them very well but i knew them enough to say hello to			0
they were very devoted to each other - they held hands everywhere they went			1
' they were both very elderly and i do n't think they were very well			0
another neighbour , who asked not to be named , said : ' i ca n't believe it - i 'm very upset			0
housebound : the @entity93 were often seen walking around holding hands , but were suffering from ill health ' the night previously they had spoken about not wanting to go to a home			1
the next thing anyone knew their bodies were lying on the grass outside the building			0
' @entity104 , who is on the building 's board of management , said : ' they have been living here for a long time - quite a few years			0
' up until last summer , you would see them together going for a walk			0
but recently , very unfortunately , they were more or less housebound			2
it is very sad indeed			0
' a police spokesman said : ' @entity116 were called at around 8.30am on tuesday 3 december 2013 to a report of a man and a woman aged in their eighties and nineties having been found deceased outside a block of flats along @entity125 in @entity13			1
' officers attended along with an ambulance crew			0
there are no suspicious circumstances and the coroner has been made aware			0
next of kin have been informed			0
' post mortem examinations were due to be conducted on the bodies today			0
