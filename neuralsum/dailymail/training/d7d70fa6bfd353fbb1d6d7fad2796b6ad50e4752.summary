by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 07:59 est , 17 june 2013 for @entity3 it seemed like a reasonable expectation – a seat next to her partner as they flew out on holiday			2
but when they head off to @entity12 in august they will be sitting separately			2
their holiday company charges couples an extra fee so they can sit together on a plane – even if they are going on honeymoon			1
a passenger was told it would cost £ 7.50 per seat to make sure she could sit with her fiance on flights for their upcoming £ 1,800 @entity24 package holiday to @entity12 @entity25 , which owns @entity24 and @entity25 , demands £ 7.50 per seat to guarantee a spot together			1
this amounts to £ 30 per couple for return flights			1
miss @entity3 , 43 , and her partner were told they would have to pay the extra fee after they had already forked out £ 1,800 for their holiday			1
she discovered the surcharge after booking the @entity24 package holiday to the southern @entity36 island			0
when she viewed her pre-assigned seats online , the legal secretary saw they were separated by an aisle			1
she rang customer services and tried to change positions , but was asked to pay £ 7.50 per alteration			1
‘ the agent assured me the charge was correct , ’ she said			0
‘ he said they have had lots of complaints			0
’ couples and friends would be charged by @entity24 and @entity25 to change their bookings so they could sit together - only parents with children would be exempt miss @entity3 , of @entity53 , @entity54 , is refusing to pay the fee , so she and her partner will have to sit separately on the three - hour flight			1
‘ it just makes me seethe , ’ she said			0
yesterday @entity59 - owned @entity25 , which sells holidays to millions of @entity61 every year , confirmed that the fee applies to all holidaymakers flying with @entity63 apart from parents sitting with children			1
no exception is made for honeymooners			0
all @entity24 passengers and many @entity25 passengers fly on @entity63 flights			1
a spokesman said : ‘ a charge is applied for these services , giving customers the peace of mind that they will be seated together			0
’ a @entity24 spokesman added : ‘ @entity63 always tries to seat customers travelling together next to each other wherever possible			0
however , along with many other @entity61 airlines , we offer an optional extra service whereby customers can pre-book specific seats			2
‘ this service not only guarantees that customers can sit together , but also allows them to choose their preferred seats			2
’ @entity84 , the @entity83 told @entity85 that this was a system that other carriers also used : “ many airlines give the option of paying in advance for pre-allocated seating which has proved popular with passengers avoiding the need to check - in very early			0
" you may well still sit together even if you have not used pre-allocation but booking in advance removes a degree of uncertainty			0
airlines will always ensure that families with small children sit close to each other			0
” last year @entity25 , which made pre-tax profit of £ 390million in 2012 , came under fire after claims it was forcing holidaymakers who had already paid for trips to shell out extra cash before they departed to cover exchange rate and fuel price fluctuations			1
a school ski trip was told to pay an extra £ 13 for every child before they could travel , while customers for an adventure holiday to @entity117 faced demands for £ 200 more .			2

@entity120 , 43 , found she and her fiance were separated by an aisle
owner @entity25 charges £ 7.50 per person to change the allocated seats
