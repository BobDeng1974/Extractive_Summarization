the commission 's ruling is non-binding but represents a small victory for the 3,400 female flight attendants at @entity2			1
@entity2 air hostesses want to wear trousers when working , something they are currently prohibited from doing since last year , they have been asking the company to relax appearance requirements that range from how many hairpins they can wear to the length of their earrings			1
the @entity24 said @entity2 required a uniform appearance through very specific rules on hairstyle and makeup , indicating that the company assumed women 's role to be that of a service provider			2
