by @entity0 the elite of @entity3 football will gather in @entity4 on thursday evening to discover their opponents in the @entity8 group stage			1
it is typically an occasion of pageantry and presentations as the continental football season gets into full swing			0
here 's your complete guide to the occasion			0
when and where is the draw taking place ? the @entity8 group stage draw will take place on thursday , with the ceremony getting underway at 4.45pm @entity25 time			1
it will take place at the @entity28 in sunny @entity29			2
who 's in the draw ? @entity33 1 - 0 @entity32 ( agg 1 - 0 ) @entity34 3 - 1 @entity35 ( agg 4 - 2 ) @entity36 4 - 0 @entity37 ( agg 7 - 2 ) @entity38 1 - 0 @entity39 ( agg 1 - 1 ) @entity40 won 6 - 5 on penalties @entity41 @entity44 3 - 0 @entity43 ( agg 4 - 2 ) the group stage consists of eight groups of four teams , so there will be 32 participants in all			2
22 of those automatically qualified for the group stage by finishing high in their respective leagues last season			0
these teams are : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity29 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
these clubs are joined by 10 more who have advanced from the play - off round			0
those who have made their way via this route are : @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity36 , @entity44 and @entity40			2
team to beat : holders @entity58 will be looking to win a record 11th @entity8 title minnows : @entity82 are in the @entity8 draw after they beat @entity92 2 - 1 on aggregrate how does the draw work ? to ensure a fair draw , the 32 teams are split into four pots based on the 2014 @entity99 club coefficients			1
the coefficients are determined by the results of each club in the @entity8 and @entity103 over the last five seasons , plus the coefficient of their national association			2
the clubs receive two points for a win , one for a draw and nothing for a defeat			2
so pot one will contain the strongest teams , including @entity58 , who are the defending champions , @entity61 , @entity60 , @entity57 and @entity33			1
juggernaut : the 2013 winners @entity61 will be among the top seeds in thursday 's draw @entity120 's best : @entity121 will be hoping to inspire @entity60 to their fifth @entity8 crown but the strength of the competition means there are usually top teams lurking in the other pots			1
pot two contains @entity62 , @entity64 , @entity68 and @entity55			1
@entity56 are in pot three			2
the one stipulation is that teams from the same country can not be drawn together			0
so there will be no @entity57 against @entity55 or @entity56 , for example			1
on the ball : @entity68 striker @entity136 will be hoping to fire them to @entity3 glory what happens then ? a computer then determines the full list of fixtures and travel plans can be made by the clubs accordingly			2
it 's a round robin format in the group stage , with each team playing the other three home and away			0
here are the dates for your diary : matchday one - september 16/17 ; matchday two - september 30/october 1 ; matchday three - october 21/22 ; matchday four - november 4/5 ; matchday five - november 25/26 ; matchday six - december 9/10			0
where can i watch the draw ? it will be screened live on @entity156 and @entity157 , as well as the @entity99 website			0
you can also follow it all live here on @entity162			0
what would be a good and bad draw for the @entity166 sides ? @entity55 being relatively new to the @entity8 stage , @entity55 are in pot two and so they will face one of @entity58 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity66 , @entity59 or @entity86 in their group			1
a nightmare draw for @entity173 's men would be , say , @entity58 , @entity72 and @entity65			1
the ideal draw would see them against @entity86 , @entity70 and @entity83			0
food for thought : @entity55 boss @entity173 will be hoping for a kind draw on thursday predator : @entity180 striker @entity180 will play a key role in @entity55 's bid to win the @entity8 @entity57 winners of the trophy in 2012 and regular semi-finalists , @entity57 are firmly entrenched in pot one			1
however , this does n't necessarily mean it 'll be a straightforward draw			0
their nightmare combination would be with @entity68 , @entity72 and @entity65			1
they did , though , beat the first two of those teams on their way to the semis last season			0
the simplest draw for @entity200 's men would be @entity201 , @entity70 and @entity83			0
happy memories : @entity57 won their only @entity8 trophy during the 2011/12 season @entity56 returning to the @entity8 after a few seasons away , @entity56 are in pot three and could face a very tricky draw			1
the worst case scenario is probably @entity58 , @entity68 and @entity65			1
on the other hand , they 'd be content with @entity86 , @entity75 and @entity83 or @entity84			0
down and out ? @entity56 could face @entity58 , @entity68 and @entity65 in their group video we 'll get better and better - @entity213 @entity33 after negotiating their way past @entity32 at the @entity215 on wednesday , @entity33 will be in the top pot. so , similarly to @entity57 , they wo n't want to get @entity68 , @entity72 and @entity65			1
once again , they would n't be too daunted by @entity201 , @entity70 and @entity83			0
up for it : @entity33 will be in the top pot of seeds after overcoming @entity32 on wednesday what about the @entity103 ? you 'll just have to be patient			2
the @entity103 draw , which will feature @entity223 and potentially @entity224 and @entity225 too , takes place on friday at midday , again at the @entity28			1
you can follow that live here on @entity162 , too			0
eyes on the prize : @entity224 will be hoping to be in the @entity103 draw on friday			0

the @entity8 draw takes place at 4.45pm @entity25 time on thursday
@entity57 , @entity56 , @entity55 and @entity33 will all be in the draw
@entity56 could draw @entity58 , @entity68 and @entity65
@entity57 and @entity33 could draw @entity68 , @entity72 and @entity65
@entity55 could face @entity58 , @entity72 and @entity65
