visits from @entity11 women have risen by 20 per cent year on year to the @entity13 specialist , which allows them to choose the sex of their baby using a process currently banned in @entity11			1
dr @entity1 says he sees around ten patients a month from the @entity11 for his £ 7,600 treatment , with 80 per cent of potential parents opting for a girl and 20 per cent a boy			1
the fertility guru is now visiting the @entity11 for the first time to discuss so - called ' gender selection ' and meet some of his ' miracle babies ' at his first ever @entity11 patient reunion			2
a pioneer in @entity38 , ivf and fertility , dr @entity1 believes in parents ' reproductive freedom to choose the sex of their child			1
he hopes his trip to the @entity11 will help make those seeking a boy or girl aware that it is possible to choose the sex of their child			1
he said : ' i 'm here to educate the @entity11 public on gender selection , explain the process and address some of the misconceptions surrounding the treatment			1
' with more and more of my patients coming from the @entity11 , i wanted to meet people face to face and explain that gender selection is a tested , trusted resource available to families			1
' the treatment process , which takes two weeks , involves husbands and wives flying out to his clinic by @entity66 , @entity67 , to provide samples			2

' my husband said " you can have one more baby " at which point i said , " if i 'm having one more i 'll make sure it 's a girl "			1
' i just think i 've always wanted a mother - daughter relationship - not to take away from what i have with my sons , which is lovely			0
a sample is taken from the couple and a series of embryos are made from the samples to make sure they are healthy			0
genetic markers in the embryo indicate whether the baby will be a boy or girl and , as a result , the desired sex will then be implanted into the mother			1

it also forbids ' the testing of embryos for the purpose of establishing their sex '			0
however , @entity11 law does allow provision for gender testing in the case of gender - related serious physical or mental medical conditions			2
dr @entity1 defended the practice against critics who believe nature should decide the sex of a baby or fear selection will lead to a sex imbalance in the @entity11 population			1
he said : ' internationally , the genders selected vary , with boys and girls selected roughly equally			0
' many couples choose to donate any remaining healthy embryos anonymously.this way , they can be adopted and made into a baby , potentially transforming someone 's life			1

many believe nature should decide and fear a population imbalance
but @entity3 doctor says couples have the right to choose and more are

80 per cent of parents opt for a baby girl and 20 per cent want a boy
