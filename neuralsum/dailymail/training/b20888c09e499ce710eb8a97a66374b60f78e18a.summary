by @entity0 published : 12:26 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 13:43 est , 18 july 2012 a £ 1 billion order for super-fast bullet trains in the @entity3 will be made in @entity4 in what critics will call a missed opportunity for @entity3 industry			1
the government is set to announce the deal which will see the @entity12 rail firm bring 500 carriages into service here by 2016			1
despite the huge size of the deal , it is expected to only create 500 @entity3 jobs with the majority of construction to be done by company @entity21 in @entity4			1
on their way : bullet trains are a major form of transport in @entity4 ( pictured ) and they 're coming here with a £ 1 billion order for 500 carriages expected by 2016 critics , including the rail union @entity30 , will argue that a @entity3 company should have insisted the entire fleet be built here to create more @entity3 jobs			1
the government will argue that this is the best deal for taxpayers as @entity21 offered the best price and most competitive tender			0
sources at the @entity42 confirmed the order was ‘ in the very final stages of negotiation ’ and an announcement was expected before the start of the @entity46			2
called the @entity50 , the bullet trains will provide extra seating to ease overcrowding , will be faster and are electric and so are more environmentally friendly			2
@entity21 will build the shells of the trains at its factory in @entity56 , near @entity57 in @entity4 before they are shipped to the @entity3 where they will be assembled before going into service			1
@entity21 says the trains shells must be built in @entity4 because they use unique technology which would be too expensive to transfer here for the order			1
but should the company win more orders it might be possible to build entire trains in the @entity3			0
bullets at @entity68 : the new bullet trains will be similar to the @entity71 trains which run from @entity72 to @entity68 ( pictured ) @entity21 general manager @entity73 said : ‘ it will be an honour to build these trains			2
‘ they will have @entity4 technology that will make them safe and reliable			0
‘ we will also use our technology to give passengers a smooth ride			0
‘ at @entity21 we deliver what we say and these trains will be a good addition to the @entity3 network			0
’ once brought to the @entity3 , the trains will be assembled in a new plant in north east @entity89 , creating an estimated 500 jobs			1
new maintenance depots will also operate in @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			0
the carriages , which will be similar to the new high speed @entity71 trains in @entity72 , will replace 125 trains which were introduced in the 1970s by @entity99 as the new ‘ age of the train ’ made famous by a tv advert fronted by @entity103			2
they will run from @entity105 to @entity93 and @entity106 , stopping at @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity112 stations			1
aluminium lengths 26 metres long will be welded together to make the trains safer in a crash , @entity21 said			0
they will also have the latest state - of - the - art electrics but interiors are to be decided by the train operator			0
