@entity0 has had worse birthdays			1
on the same day he turned 52 , @entity2 kept themselves in the hunt for @entity6 football , and it was gift - wrapped by @entity8 themselves			2
@entity11 ’s first strike in the @entity12 since november and an own goal by @entity14 did the trick against a @entity8 team threatened with being sent back to where they came from last season			1
as for @entity2 it will take some doing to get rid of them			2
just when @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 thought @entity27 qualification was primarily a scrap among themselves , this served as a reminder			0
@entity11 opened the scoring with his first goal in the @entity12 since november long celebrates putting @entity2 ahead in the 37th minute against @entity8 on saturday @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity33 6 ( @entity34 14 , 7.5 ) ; @entity35 6 , @entity36 ( c ) 6 , @entity37 6 , @entity38 8 ; @entity39 6 , @entity40 6.5 ; @entity41 6.5 , @entity42 6 ( @entity43 46 , 6 ) , long 7.5 ; @entity44 6.5 subs not used : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 manager : @entity0 7 goals : @entity11 ( 37 ) , @entity14 ( @entity53 58 ) booked : none @entity8 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity55 6 ; @entity56 6 , @entity57 ( c ) 5 , @entity58 5.5 , @entity59 6 ; @entity60 6 ( @entity61 82 ) , @entity62 6 , @entity63 5.5 , @entity64 6.5 ; @entity65 6.5 ( @entity66 74 , 6 ) , @entity67 5.5 ( @entity68 88 ) subs not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 manager : @entity75 6 goals : none booked : none match rating by @entity79 at @entity78 @entity14 's own goal at @entity81 here for our match zone service ‘ the boys gave me the best present for my birthday , ’ said @entity0 , who was serenaded by the @entity86 ’s crowd with their rendition of @entity89			1
’ yet it was horribly tense at times , as it should be against a team fighting for their @entity12 lives			2
@entity8 , fresh from beating @entity103 last week , made the @entity2 sing for their supper			2
@entity2 moved to within a point of @entity24 , albeit a game ahead , and did so without @entity33 , the keeper with the most clean sheets in the @entity12 this season			1
no sooner had the game got started than it was interrupted when @entity33 , named in @entity112 ’s @entity111 squad this week , had to be carried off on a stretcher after 14 minutes following an innocuous challenge by @entity115			1
there was nothing in it as the @entity8 striker tried to block the goalkeeper ’s clearance but @entity33 was replaced by the 38 - year - old @entity122 , and @entity0 does not think he will be able to feature for @entity111 this month			1
@entity8 shot themselves in the foot in the 58th minute when @entity14 diverted @entity38 's cross into his own net @entity8 defender @entity14 looks dejected after scoring an own goal against @entity2 yet @entity2 made do without @entity33 , and @entity11 settled their nerves on 38 minutes			1
a deflected low drive by @entity35 from the right corner of the penalty area somehow found the unmarked forward at the back post			0
a simple tap - in was all that was required , and the @entity134 obliged			0
@entity2 have dropped just two points from winning positions this season — fewer than any other team — but this was scrappy , to say the least			2
@entity44 should have scored , and passed the dreaded 1,000 - minute mark in the @entity12 since his last goal			1
he hit the crossbar from close range , produced air - kicks , had headers saved , and his luck never improved			0
‘ the first half was a little bit more difficult			0
we had good chances to score more than one goal , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ there was good movement , good attacking , good chances			0
‘ @entity44 was a little unlucky , but he was working hard			0
that ’s what you have to do if you do n’t score			0
your team - rate is important.the goals will come , ’ insisted @entity0			0
it was a good win			0
’ the game died when @entity8 shot themselves in the foot in the 58th minute			0
@entity38 had been a nuisance throughout , and his cross led to an outstretched knee by @entity8 defender @entity14 turning @entity38 ’s cross into his own net under no pressure			1
@entity2 , then , remain in the race , and the seemingly impossible remains possible			0
@entity2 keeper @entity33 was injured after 14 minutes following an innocuous challenge by @entity67 referee @entity171 checks on a stricken @entity33 in the penalty area @entity33 was carried off on a stretcher after colliding with @entity8 striker @entity67 @entity33 was replaced by 38 - year - old substitute goalkeeper @entity122 on saturday @entity8 keeper @entity55 saves bravely at the feet of @entity44 @entity8 striker @entity115 controls the ball at @entity78 @entity8 's @entity60 dives in to tackle @entity2 's @entity35 @entity2 manager @entity0 was serenaded by @entity2 fans on his 52nd birthday @entity8 manager @entity75 shows his frustration as his side went down to defeat at @entity2			1
