by @entity1 reporter published : 11:17 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 11:00 est , 30 october 2013 an 18 - year - old girl who was paralyzed in a car crash last year and told she would never walk again has miraculously defied the odds by walking down the aisle for her sister 's wedding			1
with her brother and the best man at her side at the ceremony in september , @entity8 slowly moved forward - achieving her dream and revealing her inspiring determination			1
she has been able to stand again thanks to a groundbreaking new therapy , ' locomotor ' , at @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 that recreates walking motions by force until the spinal cord learns how to control the muscles			1
' i never accepted that i could n't walk again , ' @entity24 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , told the @entity28			2
' if i do n't want to be in the chair , i 've got to do something myself to get out of it			0
' fighter : @entity8 , 18 , is pictured walking down the aisle at her sister 's wedding last month - just 15 months after she was paralyzed in a car accident and told she would never walk again success ! she stands with her brother and brother - in - law after successfully walking down the aisle @entity24 was a cheerleader looking forward to captaining her team on a summer trip to @entity43 when she broke her neck in june 2012 after she swerved to avoid a deer and rolled her truck into a ditch			1
she could see her cellphone ringing but her limbs were numb and pinned beneath her			0
two hours later , an off - duty emergency responder stumbled upon her while out for a motorcycle ride			2
in the days after the life - changing accident , she overheard doctors saying how she would never walk again and a pyschologist said she should re-think her dream of becoming a nurse			1
weeks into her recovery , she spent seven weeks in hospital in @entity60 , @entity61 before moving to the hospital in @entity19 , where she was taught how to use a wheelchair and start moving her fingers again so she could brush her hair			0
stunning : she is pictured left with her sister , @entity67 , and right , back in her wheelchair following the feat proud : she is pictured with her parents at her school prom			2
she is now hoping to become a nurse @entity8 is among thousands of paralyzed patients who are undergoing a grueling therapy called locomotor			1
the patient stands on a treadmill with a harness from the ceiling carrying much of their weight			0
then as the treadmill moves , therapists recreate the motion of walking by force - moving the limbs and joints as if taking steps			1
repetition of this allows the spinal cord to learn to control muscles the brain used to control			0
while no two patients respond to the therapy the same way , all do experience a change as a result			2
one attractive trait of the therapy is that , even if the patient never walks , the movement - even one created by an outside force - gives massive benefits to the body , such as building muscle and bone density , speeding up circulation and warding off obesity			1
then on her first meeting with her care team , one of her doctors , dr. @entity118 , came in on a wheelchair and she learned he was paralyzed in a car crash when he was 17			2
she thought : ' if he went to med school			0
i can be a nurse			0
' she returned to @entity26 for her senior year , where she cheered from her chair and , six months later went for a check up at @entity17 , where she learned she was a good candidate to try walking			2
by the end of the school year , she could stand up for 26 seconds - and appeared in her prom photos standing tall beside her parents and friends			0
two months later , she could stand for five minutes			0
she also began using a exoskelen to help her walk - a frame that supports her legs , keeps her upright and moves by feeling her intentions by how she shifts her weight			1
' i feel like i either have on a jet pack or a leaf blower , ' she said of the feeling			0
life - changing : she is pictured left before the car crash in june 2012 and right in hospital afterwards treatment : @entity24 undergoes water therapies and a new training called ' locomotor ' in which therapists recreate the movement of walking by force before her spinal cord learns how to do it persevering : she continued to cheer from her chair throughout her senior year of high school with the other locomotor therapies , overhead hoists take as much as 30 per cent of her body weight away as therapists push her joints and limbs to recreate walking on a treadmill			1
by doing this , her spinal cord will learn the movement that her brain once ordered			0
' i 've never seen her shed a tear , ' her mother @entity171 told the @entity28			0
@entity8 , who returned to her wheelchair after walking down the aisle at the wedding of her sister , @entity67 , and new brother - in - law , @entity178 , is now hoping to start nursing classes			1
