and while @entity45 marries @entity55 hero @entity71 in the show , @entity44 's second great grandfather @entity70 was a member of the @entity80 who won three campaign medals for his own bravery during the @entity55			1
classy lineage : @entity94 – the man behind @entity48 - also has noble heritage running in his blood noble roots : @entity94 's fourth great grandfather was listed on his son 's marriage record as a ' gentleman ' living in @entity102 , @entity103 in a further case of life imitating art , @entity107 – who plays @entity109 - should perhaps be familiar with ordering servants around given that her second great grandfather was a @entity30 lawyer and her third great grandmother was a wealthy landowner , both of whom had servants			1
