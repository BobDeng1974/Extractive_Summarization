a pregnant woman in @entity1 had a particularly difficult labor this week when she was held at gunpoint on her way to the hospital			1
@entity6 and her husband @entity7 were going 30 miles over the speed limit on tuesday morning in @entity9 , @entity1 , as @entity6 was in labor and felt that if the two did not get to the hospital soon she was going to give birth in a car			1
around that time , a police officer turned on his sirens to pull the couple over , but they kept going			1
the baby is coming now , ' @entity7 , who was driving , told @entity43 13			2
said @entity6 , ' i did tell him not to stop			0
' she then added , ' i think i was screaming , " oh dear @entity45 , we ca n’t have the baby in the car			0
” ' the couple called 911 to notify them of the situation , but it was too late			0
police had set up a stop and thrown down tire spikes , so the couple 's tires were blown out , and that was when things got really rough on @entity59			1
police ordered her to the ground and even held her at gunpoint , before they finally realized she had a baby on the way			2
did their best : the couple claims to have called 911 to tell them about the situation , but it did not help damage : there is now still a chance the couple will be charged for speeding and not stopping , and they will definitely need new tires ( above ) the scene : the two were going 85 mph in a 55mph zone , being stopped on @entity79 ( above ) and what a baby it was , as after the couple was driven to the hospital @entity6 gave birth to her fourth child , @entity34 , who weighed a whoping 10 pounds			1
and while the @entity87 seem to be taking this terrifying incident in stride , and mom and baby are both doing well , charges may still be brought against the two			0
manson police chief @entity92 said that while no charges have been filed yet , it ’s up to @entity95 to decide if that remains the case			0
here 's hoping these two get a break .			0

@entity6 , from @entity9 , @entity1 , and her husband @entity7 were speeding to the hospital tuesday morning as she was in labor
*fearing* she might give birth in the car , @entity6 told her husband to keep driving after an officer turned on the sirens and started following them
police eventually threw down tire spikes , and forced the couple to the ground , holding them at gunpoint , before realizing their *medical* *emergency*
shortly after , @entity6 gave birth to her fourth child , a daughter named @entity34 , who weighed in at 10 pounds
