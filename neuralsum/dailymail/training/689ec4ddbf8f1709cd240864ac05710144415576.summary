by @entity0 published : 17:19 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 22 may 2013 changes : @entity3 insiders said justice secretary @entity4 had ordered a review on changing the current sentencing regime justice secretary @entity4 is to change @entity8 ’s ‘ dishonest ’ sentencing rules that allow inmates to walk free halfway through their jail terms			1
the shake - up follows the case of ex-cabinet minister @entity14 and his former wife @entity15 who were released after serving just two months of an eight - month sentence			1
@entity17 , a backbench @entity18 mp campaigning for longer jail terms , said an ‘ overwhelming majority ’ of the public wanted inmates to serve the terms they were given			1
in reply , mr @entity4 said he had ‘ sympathy ’ with this view and hoped to be able to provide further ‘ reassurance ’ in coming months			2
the @entity18 has previously stated that it believes ‘ many people feel that sentencing in @entity8 is dishonest and misleading ’			2
@entity3 insiders said mr @entity4 had ordered a review on changing the current sentencing regime , which was introduced by @entity31 a decade ago			2
it allows all bar the worst inmates to go free at the halfway stage			1
mr @entity14 and his ex-wife , who were jailed for perverting the course of justice by swapping speeding points , then had further time cut from their sentences in return for wearing tags			1
initially , mr @entity4 ’s plans will focus on the most serious violent and sexual offenders			1
instead of being automatically freed , regardless of their behaviour , they will have to earn the right to be released			0
this could include carrying out education or other work behind bars and showing a willingness to earn the skills to go straight			0
the plan – likely to require additional prison places – will initially be limited to the worst offenders because of budget constraints			1
but mr @entity4 wants to move to a sentencing regime which is easier to understand and will rebuild public trust			1
freed : the shake - up follows the case of ex-cabinet minister @entity14 ( left ) and his former wife @entity15 ( right , both pictured on may 13 ) who were released after serving just two months of an eight - month sentence one option is to introduce a system where the courts can specify minimum and maximum sentences			1
the prisoners will only be able to leave jail after their minimum sentence is served by having earned their release			2
campaigning : @entity18 mp @entity17 said an ' overwhelming majority ' of the public wanted inmates to serve the terms they were given mr @entity4 revealed his stance in questions at @entity83 yesterday			1
mr @entity17 , a @entity18 right - winger , asked him : ‘ @entity14 and his former wife were released from prison recently after serving just two months of an eight - month sentence			1
‘ in surveys that i have conducted , an overwhelming majority of my constituents believe that prisoners should serve their sentences in full			1
' aside from locking them up for longer , will the secretary of state say how long he thinks people should serve in prison before they are released ? ’ mr @entity4 replied : ‘ on this matter , i have a lot of sympathy with what [ mr @entity17 ] says			1
i am looking closely at this area			0
i hope to be able to provide further reassurances to him in due course			0
’ making prisoners earn the right to be freed will be popular with @entity18 mps left deflated by the recent rows over gay marriage and @entity109			0
but it also fits in with mr @entity4 ’s theme of wanting a ‘ rehabilitation revolution ’ where inmates learn practical skills behind bars			2
@entity116 , deputy chairman of the @entity117 , said prison sentences should do ‘ what they say on the tin ’			0
he said : ‘ it is hugely confusing for the public who read that @entity14 is sentenced to eight months and then see him walk out weeks later			1
the same applies to someone convicted of murder and sentenced to life , something most people think is unequivocal			0
' the idea that you get up to 50 per cent off for good behaviour , which in effect is lack of bad behaviour , is nonsense ' @entity116 , @entity117 ‘ if it does not mean that the courts should say so			0
they should be open and honest			0
the idea that you get up to 50 per cent off for good behaviour , which in effect is lack of bad behaviour , is nonsense			0
‘ there needs to be transparency – the justice system is to serve the people			2
we should be honest and say that eight weeks for perverting the course of justice is an appropriate sentence			0
’ mr @entity4 also said yesterday that the @entity18 could fight the next election on a platform of withdrawing from the @entity152			0
he said : ‘ my party is looking at what proposals we want to put to the country			0
the vast majority of the population want changes to our human rights framework			2
if the @entity153 disagrees , i look forward to having that debate			0

shake - up follows early release of @entity14 and ex-wife @entity15
@entity17 says ' majority ' of public want inmates to serve full terms
plans will initially focus on most serious violent and sexual offenders
