@entity0 , the former @entity1 governor and @entity3 vice presidential candidate , blasted president @entity4 on saturday and demanded his removal from office			1
the tea party speaking - circuit darling said at the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 that talk of impeachment ' has got him nervous			1
' condemning the @entity16 's response to a swarm of illegal immigrants cascading across the @entity21 - @entity20 border , she accused @entity4 of ' not defending [ @entity21 's ] borders and called it a ' dereliction of duty , violating the oath of office			1
' ' if that 's not impeachable , then nothing is , ' she said to generous applause			0
' and if he 's not impeachable , no one is			0
' ' the " i " word ' : @entity0 called saturday on @entity32 to begin the process of removing president @entity4 from power , saying he has flouted his oath of office mini-vacay : @entity4 and his family took the @entity42 helicopter to @entity43 for a weekend retreat on friday mama grizzly : artist @entity46 produced cartoon caricatures as official gifts for speakers , including @entity0 , at the @entity9 in @entity10 ' @entity50 ' : the @entity4 administration is straining under the weight of tens of thousands of uninvited border crossers , most of them children traveling without adults			1
the @entity16 has asked @entity32 for $ 3.7 billion in new funding to handle the humanitarian crisis , but has drawn the ire of @entity3 by doing little to suggest a plan to secure the border ' no serious person can deny that team @entity4 has abused and violated the public trust and the @entity65 , ' @entity0 charged			1
' the list of abuses , it goes on and on			0
' in addition to immigration – ' amnesty ' in conservative parlance – she rattled off a list of scandals including the mistreatment of veterans by @entity78 health centers ; a cover - up about the 2012 terror attack on the @entity21 diplomatic post in @entity82 , @entity83 ; @entity84 spying on journalists , the @entity87 's alleged pattern of targeting conservative nonprofits for undue scrutiny ; and the president 's unilateral changes to his medical insurance overhaul law			1
@entity4 , she said , is ' spinning from one scandal to another scandal			2
' ' even when crystal clear evidence stares him in the face , he lies and says there 's no corruption at all			0
' @entity0 showed her comfort with hyperbole , comparing his administration to an organized crime syndicate whose capo is insulated from responsibility by staying at arm 's length from murder and mayhem			2
@entity4 , she said , ca n't ' feign ignorance of all of this , any more than a mob boss can claim innocence because , well , " he did n't personally do the hit			2
" the buck stops with the guy at the top			0
' saying @entity4 has fashioned himself more as ' a ruler , not a president , ' she brought some to their feet by declaring that @entity21 colonists ' had a revolution in 1776 because we do n't do kings			1
' and playing to an event sponsored by the evangelical @entity130 , she charged that ' it 's an affront to @entity132 to let this go on , because he gave us [ our ] freedoms			0
. ' ' we 're not going to let someone , a person , a party , take them from us , ' she said			0
' we 're not going to dethrone @entity132 and substitute him with someone who wants to play @entity132			0
' tea party : protests like this one have popped up in @entity145 and @entity146 near where @entity21 @entity147 has bused thousands of illegal immigrants each week to temporary holding centers ' @entity50 ' : the @entity4 administration is straining under the weight of tens of thousands of uninvited border crossers , most of them children traveling without adults , and has asked @entity32 for $ 3.7 billion in new funding to handle the humanitarian crisis -- without outlining a plan to secure the border throughout , she referred back to the need for conservatives to have ' the guts to talk about impeachment			1
' and time and again she pushed the immigration hot - button			0
' the @entity4 doctrine , ' she said , ' is " break the law , get a reward			2
" his incentives are invitations , and it 's gon na get worse			0
' @entity0 also alleged that the growing problem on @entity21 's southwest border is n't limited to the tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors who have shown up and taxed federal government programs to their breaking point			1
' it 's not just the innocent children , she said			2
' open borders ? nothing is there to sift out the bad guys			0
