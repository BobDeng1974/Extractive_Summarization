a clever consumer has turned the tables on one of the supermarket giants with a cheeky post to one of their social media pages			2
@entity9 user @entity8 wrote a tongue - in - cheek message to the @entity12 page claiming she had been misled by one of their products			1
she purchased a @entity17 loaf by @entity12 ' homebrand earlier this week , and expressed her dismay after discovering the bread was actually not toasted , according to @entity21			2
@entity9 user @entity8 wrote a hilarious post claiming she had been misled by one of their products ' hi @entity25			1
i picked up loaf of toast this afternoon and was really disappointed to come home and find that it was actually just a loaf of bread which i would have to toast myself , ' ms @entity8 wrote			1
' given the recent lawsuit against @entity33 regarding the freshness of their bread , i am starting to lose faith in baked goods at our major supermarkets , ' she joked			0
however @entity12 did n't seem to get they were being trolled , posting a rather serious response to a message that was clearly taking the mickey			2
@entity12 appeared to miss the joke , sending back a reasonable and professional response facebook users hijacked the post with one user agreeing the packaging was misleading ' @entity50 , we can assure you our toast is made fresh and never frozen , ' @entity12 wrote			1
' it is true toast is just the size of the slices of bread			2
we hope this helps ! thanks '			0
it is uncertain whether the supermarket giant were simply responding to the inquiry in the most professional way they could , or if they simply missed the humor in the post but other people were quick to pick up on the joke			1
others made jokes at the expense of the supermarket giant one man suggested that there was a need for a new product on supermarket shelves , an untoaster one user wrote : ' i do n't know @entity12 , the bag clearly states ' white toast ' not ' white bread cut to toast size ' ... ' ' brings me back to the classic riddle			1
what do you put in a toaster ? ' another quipped			0
however one particularly funny person seemed to have the solution to end the conversation			0
' just whack it in the untoaster to get bread ' , he wrote			0
however it seems @entity12 have since learnt to have a little fun with customers since then , posting a funny response to a customer who just was n't sure what she wanted to ask			0
@entity12 mat have learnt their lesson since , having a little more fun with some of their customers on social media			0

claimed her loaf of white toast was in fact bread and she had been misled
@entity12 let her know toast was simply the size of the bread and she would have to cook the bread herself
