by @entity0 published : 13:20 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 02:11 est , 27 february 2013 when the world was first introduced to wonky the puppy earlier this month , she cut a pitiful figure			0
the little @entity6 cross was given the unusual name because of severe problems with her malformed front legs , which failed to develop after she was separated from her mother			1
but now , after intense physiotherapy , the 12 - week - old has quickly made a fantastic recovery			0
where once she walked awkwardly on bent joints , she can now bound along normally , her tail wagging as she goes			0
@entity18 two weeks ago ... wonky , disabled by malformed joints , was found dumped on a street in @entity21 earlier this month ... and as she is now since being treated with physio , the @entity6 cross has made remarkable progress at the @entity26 staff at the trust have also given the 12 - week - old a new name - @entity29 and staff at the @entity26 in @entity21 , where she is being treated , have also given her a new name - @entity32			1
@entity33 , a vet at the centre , told how the puppy was taken there on february 9 with contracted flexor tendons on the back of her front legs - leading to a condition known as ' knuckling '			1
@entity43 of the carpal joints is caused by contraction of the tendons which prevents the wrist joint from extending fully - and meant her front feet bended inwards because her tendons were too short			2
he said that without treatment , it would have been impossible for @entity29 to straighten her legs			1
she was found wandering the streets as a stray and was brought to the @entity26 by a member of the public			2
because of her unorthodox looks , there had been concern she would struggle to find a new home			2
in fact , 600 people have so far applied to give @entity29 a home , and staff are still sifting through applications			1
@entity67 , manager at the trust , said : ' she 's had a very tough start in life			2
she was taken from her mother too early and was then having to fend for herself on the streets at just nine weeks old			0
' she is n't a traditionally pretty pooch but she 's a lovely girl with a great character			0
@entity33 , a vet at the centre , told how the puppy ( both pictured ) was taken there on february 9 with contracted flexor tendons on the back of her front legs - a condition known as ' knuckling ' with further physiotherapy , mr @entity33 said the prognosis for @entity29 is good because of her unorthodox looks , staff were concerned she would struggle to find a new home - but 600 people have applied to look after her			1
above , @entity29 finds her feet during her rehabilitation ' we really hope people can see beyond appearances and someone can give her the fresh start she deserves - a new home where she 'll be loved and cared for			1
' with further physiotherapy , the prognosis for @entity29 is good			2
and since the trust wants her kept under review , it would prefer her to be rehoused in @entity21			1
' it 's such a sad case because this was completely preventable if only she 'd had the right love and care , ' ms @entity98 said			0
' she had not had the right supplements to enable her to grow properly and so her front legs were too weak			1
' we do n't know everything about her background but we think that she was removed from her mother too early and was then abandoned			0
she had not had the right nutrition and a poor diet meant her front legs were underdeveloped			1
' she added : ' @entity111 will really help to strengthen her muscles			0
we have to stretch her legs into a straight position 30 times twice a day			0
' it 's such a sad case because this was completely preventable if only she 'd had the right love and care , ' said @entity67 , manager at the trust ' she will need regular trips to the specialist vet to keep a track of her progress			0
' with the right treatment , she will hopefully be able to live a normal life and do all the things a puppy should be able to enjoy			0
staff are looking for owners who can continue her physiotherapy - with costs supplemented by @entity26			2
it is the @entity133 's largest dog welfare charity and cares for more than 16,000 stray and abandoned dogs each year through its network of 18 @entity137 across the @entity133 and one in @entity139			0
@entity141 spokesman for the charity said : ' usually , physical deformity is the result of unscrupulous breeders or they have n't been properly looked after and most of the time it 's something that is completely preventable			0
' if you would like to give @entity29 a new home , contact @entity149 on 0113 281 4920			1
follow all the animals at the @entity26 on their website or @entity153 page @entity29 now needs a new loving home , ideally in @entity21			1

600 people apply to @entity26 in @entity21 to give @entity157 a new home
