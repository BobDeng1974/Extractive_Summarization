a mother says her six - year - old daughter is only alive today thanks to the local optician who correctly suspected she had a huge brain tumour			1
@entity4 had become so concerned about her daughter @entity6 's headaches that she took her to the local hospital - where doctors simply diagnosed a migraine			1
it was only when the family optician saw her that she became worried she had many of the telltale signs of a brain tumour			1
after being rushed back to hospital , doctors discovered @entity6 had a brain tumour the size of an orange - which would have killed her within a week			1
risk : @entity21 would have been dead within a week had an optician not spotted her brain tumour			1
her mother @entity24 is furious that doctors at the local hospital did not scan her to test for the condition lucky : it was only during an eye test than an optician mrs @entity4 a leaflet on brain tumours ( left )			1
to her horror , mrs @entity4 realised @entity6 ( who is now back at school ) had seven of the eight warning signs recalling the nightmare situation , mrs @entity4 said : ' @entity6 had been ill for about a week in november last year and we thought it was a virus			1
' i took her to the doctors because it was not going away and they said it could be migraines or a virus			2
' they gave her tablets for migraines			0
' we left it for about five days but she was still waking up screaming in pain			0
i got the doctor out on the friday and he said to go to @entity49			2
' there , after being seen by a student doctor @entity6 was referred to a senior colleague			2
the doctor carried out a set of tests on the youngster , including those for lack of co-ordination , which is a symptom of having a brain tumour			1
however he decided not to give @entity6 a scan			1
mrs @entity4 said : ' he gave her a check - up and was banging her knees			2
' she had to walk up and down and do other tests but they still thought it was a virus or something to do with migraines			2
' the doctor said " i know what you are going to ask , you are going to ask for a scan , but she does n't need one "			2
' recovery : she also had surgery to have the orange - sized cancerous tumour cut out of her brain mrs @entity4 was then told she should get @entity6 's eyes tested and to come back in a month if they still persisted			1
concerned , she took her daughter to the local optician in @entity82 , @entity83 , the next morning			1
' they know us well and they looked at her eyes , ' said mrs @entity4			0
the optician then gave her a leaflet on brain tumours - and , to her horror , mrs @entity4 realised @entity6 was suffering from seven of the eight warning signs			1
mrs @entity4 , who has three older children , said : ' the tumour was too low down for them to see it but they gave me a leaflet and @entity6 ticked every box apart from epilepsy			1
' terrified , her husband called a family friend , who works as a consultant in @entity103			0
she advised the couple to take @entity6 to hospital straight away			1
within 40 minutes , doctors at @entity107 had carried out a mri scan which revealed the orange - sized brain tumour			1
she then underwent emergency surgery to have fluid drained from her brain and later more surgery the tumour removed			1
scarred : @entity6 had to undergo emergency surgery to have fluid drained from her brain doctors at the hospital told @entity119 and @entity120 that had the tumour not been found , @entity6 would have been dead within a week			1
her mother said : ' it was absolutely crazy			2
they said if i had n't brought her in she would have been dead within a week			0
' our world collapsed when they detected the scan			2
my husband said to the surgeons : " please tell me you have magic hands "			0
symptoms listed on the pamphlet mrs @entity137 was given by the optician : ' @entity139 happen			0
symptoms include : * @entity140 / recurrent headache * persistent / recurrent vomiting * balance / coordination / walking problems * abnormal eye movements * blurred or double vision * behaviour change * fits or seizures * abnormal head position such as wry neck , head tilt or stiff neck if your child has one of these , see your doctor			0
if they have two or more , ask for an ' urgent referral '			0
' ' we just went into overdrive			0
we were crying but we did n't want to cry in front of @entity6			2
' i was so cross when i found out i could have lost her			0
' ' @entity49 should have done the scan			1
' when we found out about the tumour it was like i was watching a film			0
' as a mum i know my daughter			0
i 'm not one to take her to the doctors for a cold , it 's only when there is something really wrong			0
' the surgery was the longest six and a half hours of my life			0
we were all a right mess			0
' @entity6 stayed in hospital for 11 days and was able to go home in time for @entity180			1
she is now back in school but needs to go back for a scan next month to make sure that the tumour has not spread to her spine			2
mrs @entity4 added : ' i just can not thank the optician enough			0
' it was she who suggested something was seriously wrong after doctors at @entity49 and thought @entity6 may have a virus or possibly migraine			1
' i took her a bunch of flowers but it does n't seem enough			0
' the family is now considering legal action			0
