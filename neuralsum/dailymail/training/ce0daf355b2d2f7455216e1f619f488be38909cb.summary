by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 4 november 2013 @entity2 : 19:04 est , 4 november 2013 @entity4 chairman baroness @entity3 said children should start school at two years old children should start school when they are two to stop the most disadvantaged from slipping behind , according to the @entity4 chairman			1
baroness @entity3 believes that a ‘ big , bold , brave ’ move is needed to tackle the under - achievement of under - fives from the poorest areas across the country			1
currently most children in @entity16 go to nursery at the age of three or four before starting school in the september following their fourth birthday			1
legally all children living in @entity16 have to be in full - time education by the term after their fifth birthday			1
but @entity3 told an education seminar held in @entity26 that schools ‘ could be two to 18 as far as i ’m concerned ’			1
she added : ‘ if you could get them coming into school at a different level then it would save time and be transformative			0
’ the move comes amid complaints from teachers that too many children who are arriving at reception classes are still in nappies , unable to speak properly and lacking basic skills			2
@entity3 believes changing the rules would mean ‘ early intervention work , from the age of two , was really focused on the poorest children ’			1
she said : ‘ you ’re much more likely to have them starting primary school , ready , without the big gap and ready to learn			2
‘ but at the moment , a lot of the children from really disadvantaged backgrounds are not ready to learn so the school almost has to provide nurturing before it can start to educate			2
’ a recent @entity4 report found that poor five - year - olds are still 19 months behind their more affluent peers			1
@entity3 went on to say : ‘ what a dire start to their educational life			2
those children had low level social skills , especially reading and communication			0
they ’re not ready to learn at school			0
‘ weak parenting , low educational attainment of parents , poor diet , poor housing and so on – the gap between affluent and disadvantaged is greatest in that group			2
’ she added : ‘ i think there needs to be a big , bold , brave move on the under - fives agenda to target funding heavily on the children who will benefit most and increasingly , i think , to look to strong providers to go further down the system			1
’ however , critics said that children are already expected to do ‘ too much , too soon ’ and should be allowed more time to play			0
dr @entity82 , from the @entity81 , labelled her comments as ‘ completely misguided ’			0
he said : ‘ if this proposal happens , i think it could be a catastrophe for young children			0
’ he added : ‘ what will happen is that early childhood is going to become “ schoolified ”			0
‘ that early childhood time when children are young – at least up to the age of five , and i would say six – is a period of their development and learning which has its own intrinsic value			0
‘ it should n’t be treated merely as a preparation for schooling			0
’ a recent @entity4 report found that poor five - year - olds are still 19 months behind their more affluent peers a @entity101 spokesman said : ‘ we know that teacher - led early years education has a positive impact on children , especially on those from low income backgrounds			1
‘ that is why we are making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two by removing the requirement on them to register separately with @entity4 when doing so , and introducing 15 hours of free early education for 240,000 of the poorest two - year - olds			1
‘ our wider reforms will ensure all children , regardless of their background , get a good start in life			0
