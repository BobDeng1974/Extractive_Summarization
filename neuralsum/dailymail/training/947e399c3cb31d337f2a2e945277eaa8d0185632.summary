@entity1 's @entity2 has a leg injury and is highly unlikely to play in the @entity5 showdown against @entity6 on tuesday , the @entity1 's team doctor said on saturday			1
the 30 - year - old midfielder played the full 90 minutes in both of @entity1 's games in the tournament , a 2 - 1 victory over @entity11 and a 1 - 0 loss to @entity13			1
' he has a muscle problem in his leg , ' @entity14 told a news conference on saturday			2
' it is highly unlikely that he will be able to play on tuesday			1
' @entity2 is likely to replaced by @entity29 - born @entity28 alongside the influential @entity30 in midfield			2
a point against @entity6 would send the @entity32 through to the knockout stage with @entity13			2
@entity14 said @entity2 would probably need a week to 10 days to recover completely , making him also a doubt for @entity1 's potential last - 16 clash , should they get the result they need on tuesday			1
@entity39 : @entity1 were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity13 and another defeat would send them home central defender @entity42 , who was an injury doubt before the @entity11 and @entity13 matches because of a long - term tendonitis problem , is recuperating well and will be up to playing a third match in 10 days , @entity14 said			1
there was also good news about fullback @entity48 , who missed the first two games of the tournament with a calf strain but is back in training and will be available			0
there had been a couple of minor knocks for other members of the squad in the @entity13 match , @entity14 said , but none that would prevent anybody from playing			0
tuesday 's match is again an early kick - off with the @entity32 taking on @entity6 in the full heat of the day as they did in the match against @entity13			1
@entity14 said the heat had caused the @entity32 problems in @entity67 but at least the @entity68 would be equally unaccustomed to it			0
' for the @entity70 , the temperature was routine but for us it was tough , ' he said			0
' the players felt it			0
against @entity6 , it will impact both sides in the same way			0

@entity80 midfielder *struggling* to be fit for tuesday 's game which will *determine* @entity1 's @entity5 fate
he would also be doubtful for a last - 16 game should they make it through
