a catholic priest fed up with mobiles constantly ringing and beeping during his sermons has installed a jamming device to stop phones from going off			2
father @entity5 found his services in @entity7 , @entity8 , were constantly interrupted by jingling incoming calls and buzzing text alerts			1
he had an engineer fix the £ 40 device inside the @entity14 church after receiving approval from the local police			1
father @entity5 finally flipped after he found his services in @entity7 , @entity8 , were constantly interrupted by jingling incoming calls and buzzing text alerts but now local businesses are asking for him to remove it as they claim it blocks contact card cash devices in their stores			1
father @entity5 said : ' i had put signs up asking people to switch off their phones after having services disrupted			2
' phones were always going off during @entity31 and at other events like funerals which just was n't on			0
' what really annoyed me is that when it first started people would switch off their phones in embarrassment now they are cupping their hands over the receiver and carrying on talking			0
' i bought the jammer from a local electrical store and asked the police if it was ok and they said it was - it 's great as it has stopped the problem but some of the local shops are n't happy			0
' one shop owner said : ' since father @entity5 started using the jammer i 've had real problems using my card swiper for payments			2
' it just does n't work and i 'm losing money			0
others are in the same position - i understand how he feels but what about us ? this is our busiest time of the year			0
' the priest had an engineer fix the £ 40 device inside the @entity14 church in @entity7 , @entity8			1

father @entity5 's sermons in @entity7 were constantly interrupted
so he had a £ 40 device fixed inside the @entity14 church
but shops claim it blocks their contact card devices and want it removed
