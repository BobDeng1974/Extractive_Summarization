by @entity0 published : 17:32 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 20:57 est , 27 september 2013 @entity4 has squeezed out every other language in the competition to become the common tongue of @entity8 , an @entity3 report confirmed yesterday			1
it found that @entity4 is the most popular foreign language in all but five @entity8 countries , and all of those are small nations that use the language of their larger neighbours			1
two out of three people across the continent have at least a fair working knowledge of @entity4			1
growing and growing : two thirds of people across the continent have at least a working knowledge of @entity4 not one country can be found where the preferred second language is @entity27 , once the language of international diplomacy and still the vehicle by which @entity27 governments try to promote their influence abroad			1
@entity27 remains the @entity8 common language only in the offices of @entity8 institutions			1
it is one of the three working languages of the @entity39 in @entity40 , alongside @entity4 and @entity41 , and the main language of the @entity43 in @entity44 , alongside @entity4			1
the report published by the @entity3 statistics arm @entity46 suggests that the dominance of @entity4 is likely to become even greater in the future			1
it found that 94 per cent of secondary school pupils and 83 per cent of primary age pupils across the @entity3 are learning @entity4 as their first foreign language , more than four times as many as learn @entity27 , @entity41 or @entity54			1
only in @entity55 and @entity56 is @entity27 the top foreign language in schools			2
the findings raise a series of questions about the future of languages in the @entity3			0
they will deepen criticism of the way the @entity3 spends an estimated £ 1 billion a year translating all of its documents into the 23 official languages of the bloc			0
understand ? @entity4 has become the mother tongue in @entity8 the popularity of @entity4 also opens the prospect of a difficulty if @entity55 should quit the @entity3			2
that would leave @entity40 running a union whose real common language would be spoken as a native tongue only by the 4.6 million people of the @entity80 - fewer than one in 100 of its population			0
however , the swing towards @entity4 underlines the growing problem of the decline of language teaching in @entity55 schools and universities			2
it suggests the motivation for learning languages among native @entity4 speakers weakens when people can speak @entity4 wherever in the world they may go			0
the report said : ‘ the importance of @entity4 as a foreign language is confirmed among working age adults			2
in the @entity3 , @entity4 was declared to be the best - known language amongst the population aged 25 to 64			2
’ two thirds of adults knew @entity4 , with one in five of these saying they were proficient , 35 per cent spoke it well , and 45 per cent reckoned they had a fair command of @entity4			0
the findings , taken from the large - scale @entity106 conducted in 2011 , were published to mark the @entity107 , an event ‘ to promote the rich linguistic and cultural diversity of @entity8 ’ and to encourage language learning			0
@entity4 was best known in @entity111 , where 94 per cent of people speak it , and least in @entity114 , where 60 per cent know some @entity4 but only one in 10 people consider themselves proficient			0
other languages were more widely spoken only in @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , neighbours of @entity121 and where there are many native @entity124 speakers , in @entity125 , where @entity41 is an official language , and @entity127 , where many speak @entity128			0
@entity4 was the main language taught in schools outside the @entity131 everywhere but @entity125 , where the @entity3 says @entity41 is a foreign language .			0

two thirds of @entity8 have at least working knowledge of @entity4
not a single country where @entity27 was the preferred second language
the dominance of @entity4 is likely to get greater
