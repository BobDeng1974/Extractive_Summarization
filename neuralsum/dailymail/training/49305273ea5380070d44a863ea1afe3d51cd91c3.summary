for anyone who was relying on being able to escape from a robot simply by climbing stairs , it could be a bone chilling sight			2
researchers in @entity5 have revealed astonishing footage of a human - like robot able to walk , jump and run over almost any obstacle in its path			1
eventually it is hoped the technology could be used to create a new breed of robotic soldiers able to operate in any terrain , and robots capable of being sent into dangerous disaster zones deemed impossible for humans to enter			1
the amazing robot , called proto - pet , is expected to be one of those competing in the @entity38 ( @entity39 ) which was announced today			2
the @entity5 military funded challenge is for robots who can operate entirely by themselves			1
' the @entity46 â€™s strategic plan calls for the @entity47 to conduct humanitarian , disaster relief and related operations , ' @entity38 said in a statement			0
' the plan identifies requirements to extend aid to victims of natural or man - made disasters and conduct evacuation operations			0
' some disasters , however , due to grave risks to the health and wellbeing of rescue and aid workers , prove too great in scale or scope for timely and effective human response			0
the robots will compete next year in a series of events designed to show off how they could help out in a disaster zone ' the @entity38 ( @entity39 ) will attempt to address this capability gap by promoting innovation in robotic technology for disaster - response operations			1
' the primary technical goal of the @entity39 is to develop ground robots capable of executing complex tasks in dangerous , degraded , human - engineered environments			0
' robots entered into the contest will also be expected to use tools normally operated by humans			0
' competitors in the @entity39 are expected to focus on robots that can use standard tools and equipment commonly available in human environments , ranging from hand tools to vehicles , with an emphasis on adaptability to tools with diverse specifications			0
' the contest will culminate next year , when the robots will participate in two live events june 2013 and december 2013			1
