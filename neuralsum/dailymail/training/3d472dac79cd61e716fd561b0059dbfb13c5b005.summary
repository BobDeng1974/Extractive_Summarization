up to 200 people use it daily , and it is a very dark crossing			2
' @entity121 and @entity161 need to put their heads together			0
i do not know the ins and outs of this tragedy , but something is obviously not right			0
' it is time it was sorted , before we have another one			0

' local resident @entity195 , 27 , said : ' it ’s disgusting			2
it has been a death - trap for years			1
the fact there are trams and trains travelling in the same direction at different speeds confuses people			0

” @entity210 , the mp for @entity211 , said : ' there is clearly a problem at this point , because there have been a number of accidents and we need to separate trams from pedestrians here			0
the best way to do that would be with a bridge			0
