@entity7 and @entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , had no idea their pet swine , affectionately called @entity14 , would become the enormous house guest it is today			1
when they took in what they thought was a ' mini pig ' they assumed it would not grow to more than 70lbs			1
mr @entity7 , 31 , told @entity40 : ' she said she had a mini pig that was n't getting along with her two dogs and new baby and it was causing a lot of chaos , so i told her i 'd love to take her			1
' the couple discovered their mistaken when they took their new pet to the vets			2
it was quickly pointed out that they had a rather large problem on their hands			0
but they had now become too attached to the pig and had no intention of letting it go			2
@entity7 and @entity8 took @entity14 welcomed her into their home , raising her just like one of their two other dogs			1
but mr @entity7 says they could not bear to be separate from their beloved pig			1
porker : @entity14 the wonder pig was meant to be a ' mini pig ' but turned out to be a rather larger specimen menagerie : @entity7 and @entity8 share their home with their pets , including a 385lb pig making yourself at home : @entity14 settles down on the sofa for a short nap ' she 's infectious			1
' there 's something about her personality			0
and she 's so unbelievably intelligent , ' mr @entity7 said			2
' she will actively seek us out to cuddle , ' he explained to @entity88			0
' if she wants to sleep , she wants to sleep with you			0
she climbs right up on the couch with us			0
that 's her preferred spot to sleep			0
the story of the cute animal happily co-existing with humans in apparent domestic bliss has convinced another of people to give up eating meat and become vegans			0
creature comforts : for animals usually found rooting around in mud and dirt , @entity14 enjoys a far more comfortable life run of the house : @entity14 happily dozes alongside some of the other pets she shares the house with a @entity37 page , called @entity113 , dedicated to documenting the daily life of @entity14 has received almost 55,000 likes			1
@entity116 wrote on the @entity37 page : ' my daughter - in - law introduced me to your @entity37 page today			1
' you , dear @entity14 , reinforce my commitment to transition to vegan in the near future			1
i am new to the vegetarian lifestyle , at age 67 , and am sorry i did not start sooner			0
' your dads are my kind of people ! @entity131 mom had a regular sized pet pig nearly 80 years ago			2
i think she would have loved you too			0
may you have only the sweetest of dreams , dear girl			0
' hungry : @entity14 waits patiently for her supper			2

@entity7 and @entity8 *inherited* it from a friend on @entity37
couple of @entity9 did n't think their ' mini pig ' would grow bigger than 70lbs
@entity14 grew from a few pounds in weight to a *monster* 385lbs
they now let the huge pig have the run of their home
pig becomes a @entity37 *celebrity* - convincing some people to go vegan
