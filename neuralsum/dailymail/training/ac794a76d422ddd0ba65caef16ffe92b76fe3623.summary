' great crime ' : @entity1 says his party created a culture of low expectations for state school pupils @entity6 created a culture of low expectations for state school pupils , @entity1 , the shadow education secretary , has admitted			1
he said it was a ‘ great crime ’ that the last government had failed to pushed children more than simply aim for them to achieve a c grade at gcse level			1
he also admitted that exams had been dumbed down in recent years , saying ‘ yes , there are elements of grade inflation ’			1
@entity6 now wants to introduce licences for teachers , stripping them of their right to be in the classroom if they fail assessments carried out every five years			1
in a startlingly frank admission , mr @entity1 said : ‘ the great crime was an awful lot of effort being put on kids getting a c at @entity29 , then not going further			2
there should be no limits - the system should be saying how far can this child go ? ’ schools were too focused on the pass grade , ‘ c ’ , because of its significance in league tables			1
he said that education should not just be about exam results			1
‘ what do people who send their children to private school want ? it ’s not just smaller class sizes			1
it ’s the playing fields and the after - school stuff like music and drama because they help to build confidence and character			2
’ he told the @entity54 : ‘ we need to work out how we can generate all those elements for everyone within a broad education and value them alongside academic rigour			2
’ @entity6 would not shut surviving grammar schools but mr @entity1 said their social mix should be questioned			1
‘ if they are simply about merit why do we see the kind of demographics and class make - up within them ? ’ instead of focusing on a handful of specialist schools , he called for the whole system to be more aspirational			0

‘ the quality of an education system can not be greater than the quality of its teachers			2
’ under his plans , teachers would have their lessons assessed by other teachers to demonstrate they were keeping pace			0
a new @entity106 of @entity107 would supervise the licencing regime			0
he said while bad teachers could currently be fired , there was a lot of ‘ recycling ’ where they were simply hired by another school			0
‘ there is usually a collection of teachers who are not at the cutting edge and this is a check upon that			0
if a teacher has left one school but then gets a renewed enthusiasm , great , but they would need to pass the re-licensing a s a sign of confidence			0
’ mr @entity1 , who has been tipped as a future leader , was privately educated at £ 15,000 - a - year @entity126 in @entity127 and has a phd from @entity129			0
he has previously said he would not rule out sending his own children to private school , although his son currently attends a state school in @entity127			2
