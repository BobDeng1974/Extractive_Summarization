an animal lover is raising money to help a @entity3 dog get life - changing fake limbs after he was found wandering the countryside on stumps as somebody had cut off his two front legs			1
colin the dog had been cruelly mistreated by its previous owner when it was discovered by @entity3 animal welfare activist @entity11 who contacted her friend @entity13 who launched the ambitious rescue mission			1
ms @entity13 organised transport for @entity16 from @entity17 in @entity3 to @entity18 , @entity19 where he will be fitted with his new limbs			1
the 48 - year - old former pub landlady from @entity18 , @entity19 said she managed to bring @entity16 to the @entity35 after raising more than £ 6,000 for his treatment			1
he was transported almost 1,700 miles from @entity3 to @entity37 , where ms @entity13 picked him up and drove the final part of the trip to @entity19			1
initially , it was hoped that £ 5,000 would cover @entity16 's medical bills but he has required a longer stay in the vet and additional surgery , pushing the total bill towards £ 10,000			1
colin the dog recovering from surgery on his two front legs after being mistreated in @entity17 , @entity3 @entity16 traveled almost 1,700 miles from @entity17 in @entity3 to @entity18 , @entity19 however , he will soon be fitted with his £ 3,000 prosthetic legs which have been specially flown in from the @entity28			1
she said : ' he was found in a horrendous state , he 'd been walking on bare bones , the skin on his two front legs had come off and he had a lot of infection			1
' he 'd probably lost them months before , the vets said they 'd been chopped off deliberately			2
' according to ms @entity13 : ' they have very limited vet facilities out there , and most of them are totally unsanitary			0
luckily my friend knew of one in @entity67 that was good			0
' there he was cleaned up and given antibiotics , we spoke to a company called @entity73 who organise for limb reconstuction in badly injured animals			0
' due to the severity of his injury , @entity16 is undergoing additional surgery to further trim his front legs to ensure that the prothetics will be a success			1
' we hoped he would n't need any more surgery but we have to cut back the bone to allow enough skin to cover the stump			2
the stitches have to be on the side so they do n't rub on the new legs			2
' the new limbs feature a cone which slides over the remaining stumps allowing @entity16 to walk once again			2
when @entity16 the dog was rescued two bones were protruding through the skin at the bottom of his stumps after his wounds were cleared and the infection was treated , @entity16 the dog soon perked up @entity16 has one more bout of surgery before he can be fitted with his new prosthetic legs the new limbs have been ordered from the @entity28 and will be fitted once @entity16 recovers from his latest bout of surgery			1
according to ms @entity13 : ' it 's so rewarding to see dogs that have been mistreated rehomed to loving families			2
it will take two or three weeks after he 's fitted with the artificial legs for him to get used to it , just because he wo n't know what 's going on			1
' ms @entity13 said @entity16 's injuries were caused by someone who deliberately cut off his front legs			1
' i asked the vet whether he might have been caught in a trap but he said the injuries were level and looked deliberate			0
if he had been caught in a trap the injuries would have been different			0
' i can not understand why someone would want to do that to a dog			0
but animal cruelty is a major problem out in @entity3			1
i want @entity16 to be a poster boy to highlight the issue and hopefully there will be no more colins in future			2
' there are dead dogs on every street in @entity134 , some tie wire around their necks and drag them around for pleasure			0
you 'd be arrested over here for doing that			0
' i have rescued a dog from over there before who had her entire face cut off with a machete , she was supposed to be a @entity149 but the new family thought she was a pug because of her injuries			0
i ca n't imagine how anyone could be so cruel			2
' according to @entity13 , right , animal cruelty is quite common in @entity3 and she wants @entity16 , left , to be a ' poster boy ' to highlight the issue added ms @entity29 : ' @entity16 has had all his injections now , which he needed for coming to the @entity35 after he had been living in the dirt with open wounds			1
' there are about 100,000 stray dogs in @entity134 alone , but dog shelters just seem to pocket the money			0
very few are actually given any food or medical care			0
' then there is the cruelty - people just go round the streets beating , maiming and even poisoning them			0
it 's an act of power that people abuse , the poor dogs are completely defenceless			2
' people have donated from all over the world to see him come over and get rehomed - i 've been so overwhelmed by the whole thing			0
' it 's really restored my faith in humans			0
' colin the dog has received money from well - wishers around the globe who want to see him back on his feet			0
