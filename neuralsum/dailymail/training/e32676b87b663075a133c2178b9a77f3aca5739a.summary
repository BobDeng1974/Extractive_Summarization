died aged 91 : labour former cabinet minister @entity0 was praised as an ' extraordinary individual ' @entity3 former cabinet minister @entity0 has died aged 91 , his party said today			1
he was the treasury chief secretary in the 1970s who devised the system for allocating public spending to @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 that came to be known as the @entity10			1
the formula has remained in place , despite @entity0 ’s arguments that it was a temporary fix and ought to be reformed as it now produces unfair results			1
@entity17 in the @entity18 said : ‘ @entity19 was an extraordinary individual			1
‘ as an mp , minister and colleague in the @entity22 , to the very end he was diligently holding the government to account and doing his best to ensure the best for the people of this country			2
’ lord @entity0 's daughter @entity28 said he died peacefully at home on saturday morning after a short illness			1
she said he retained his interest in politics during his illness and ‘ the last words he spoke to me were about the @entity37 budget ’			2
the upsurge in interest in the @entity10 following the @entity40 - and the ‘ vow ’ by @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 to retain the system - had provided a ‘ great boost ’ to him , she said			2
he is pictured arriving at 10 @entity47 in @entity48 in 1976 during his time as treasury chief secretary former cabinet minister : @entity0 ( left and right ) died peacefully at home on saturday after a short illness ms @entity54 said : ‘ the @entity10 thing during the @entity7 referendum was a great boost to him , because he was able to say what he had been saying for a long time to anybody who would listen , but this time people were listening			1
‘ he had the chance finally to tell people just why he thought it was not only unfair but undemocratic			0
' the change in planned spending in departments in @entity66 x the extent to which the relevant @entity66 departmental programme is comparable with the services carried out by each devolved administration x the population proportion in each country = increased spending for each country funded by central government in september , lord @entity0 wrote in the @entity77 that ' the @entity10 should be scrapped as soon as is practicable and replaced by a statutory body charged with distributing government spending in a way that the most money goes to areas that need it most '			1
he added : ' after 36 years , during which i have become increasingly ashamed of having my name attached to the current system , they are quite welcome to use my name for this replacement system			0
i have become thoroughly disillusioned with the old one			0
' lord @entity0 attended @entity91 , and worked as an accountant in his early career - before first serving in politics as a councillor on @entity96 in 1956			2
in 1964 he was elected mp for @entity98 and @entity99 , and became @entity101 chief secretary in 1974			1
he was @entity102 chairman in 1979 , and was made a life peer in 1983			0
there was already a long - established convention for funding public spending in @entity7 , based on the relative populations of @entity66 and @entity7 almost a century before			0
i merely adjusted the figures to take account of changes in the relative populations of the four home nations and drew up the spending figures accordingly – which actually resulted in a 2 per cent reduction in funding for @entity7 over the settlement they would have been due under the previous , outdated population statistics			0
my idea was to have the settlement ratified by the @entity121 , which it duly was			0
then , i knew , the @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity123 would have to take any claims for more money to @entity121 , rather than try to petition me			0
i never thought the arrangement – there was and is no proper ‘ formula ’ that works out how much money is needed and where it should be spent – would last any longer than a year or two , certainly not after the next general election .			0
