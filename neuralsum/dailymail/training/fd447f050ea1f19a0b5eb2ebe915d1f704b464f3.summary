by @entity0 published : 10:35 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 11:27 est , 28 october 2013 harassment : @entity2 , pictured outside court in may , has been convicted of breaking restraining orders banning her from contacting @entity6 employees a former bank worker who was arrested for sending poison to @entity6 chief executive @entity9 has escaped jail after being found guilty of harassment			1
@entity2 breached a restraining order when she emailed the bank boss accusing him of conspiring against her and threatening to publicise his children 's address			1
she also wrote an aggressive letter to prosecuting barrister @entity19 , claiming he was guilty of perverting the course of justice			2
@entity22 , 52 , was arrested in october last year after mr @entity9 received a letter containing a vial of liquid which purported to be poison			1
she subsequently sent the @entity6 boss an email in which she accused him of framing her , writing : ' i intend to flush you out mr @entity9 , as i believe it is you behind this			1
' you tried repeatedly to have me framed and fitted up over the past few years			2
' there are two options : either you fabricated the letter or there is a nutter out there who may attack a member of your staff			0
' i intend to publish the address of where that person can find your children and your wife and your new wife on 19 november			2
if you have something to fear you will resolve this with me pronto			0
' if you were behind this , you will not settle this case with me , so by november 19 i will know			0
' @entity22 was arrested once again and charged with breaching a restraining order , and was found guilty by a jury earlier this year			1
she has not faced any charges related to the alleged poison which was sent to mr @entity9 , who stepped down as the bank 's chief executive earlier this month			1
last month , @entity22 emailed mr @entity19 , who represented the @entity60 in her trial			1
' barrister and part - time judge @entity19 on behalf of the @entity60 in may 2013 perverted justice and allowed an abuse of process plus a few other dirty tricks to gain two convictions which he knows were gotten by the @entity60 by deceit			0
' he knew that 78 crimes that i had reported had not been investigated properly and that the @entity73 police tampered with evidence but did not stop the trial which he should have and yet this man is a judge			0
' convicted : @entity22 , left , repeatedly sent emails to mr @entity9 , right , despite a court ban as he handed @entity22 a suspended prison sentence at @entity81 , judge @entity79 said : ' i had hoped that since her conviction she would have learnt a lesson - i am afraid she has caused a real disappointment			1
' i was worried about the mental state of this defendant as she had told me she had suffered from depression and there is no doubt she has had a hard life			0
she is a highly intelligent and articulate person but i fear that she is suffering from some real problems			0
' since the last hearing there has been more material sent to the court with some of it being long - winded and polite and some have been of a more aggressive style			0
for example , an email addressed to me and mr @entity19 makes reference to " nazis " - i take no personal insult , as she apologised the next day in yet another email			0
' also in reference to mr @entity19 there is some scandalous defamation on the defendant 's website and i would just like to comment , he has acted to the highest standards of the bar throughout proceedings			2
' i have no doubt she is not prepared to cooperate and see a psychiatrist and despite her undoubted good characteristics she does have , i fear that she is now just outside the prison door			0
' i am going to make a restraining order in the real hope that she complies - i make absolutely clear any further breach and she will go to prison			2
' grudge : @entity22 had a vendetta against @entity130 , owned by @entity6 , because of a run - in with an employee @entity22 was sentenced to three months in jail , suspended for two years , and is banned from contacting various public officials , including any director or former director of @entity6 , and anyone involved in her court case			1
the defendant must also pay Â£ 3,500 costs for bombarding the @entity60 with emails and will be under supervision for two years			0
representing herself , @entity22 said : ' my website is very emotive - i should imagine you have not had time to read all of it but every time i make a claim i show a document that proves they did pervert justice			1
' the trial took place because the police would not help me			0
you have said that what i said is nonsense on the website and i have between 1994 and 2003 reported numerous crimes to the police which were never dealt with properly			0
' @entity22 has spent nearly 20 years campaigning against the bank after being ' freaked out ' by a member of @entity130 's call centre staff who allegedly took her home address from the bank 's computers and paid her repeated visits even after she moved home			1
@entity22 , from @entity170 in @entity171 , continued to contact the bank about her concerns , and was convicted of harassing former chairman sir @entity175 in 2000			1
she was then banned from contacting any employees of @entity130 or @entity6 , or any police officers involved in her case			1
privately educated @entity22 , who has a degree in psychology and social anthropology from the @entity184 , worked for @entity130 - now part of @entity186 - from 1977 - 78			2
she said she had a turbulent upbringing , with divorced parents living in different countries threatening to kidnap her .			0
