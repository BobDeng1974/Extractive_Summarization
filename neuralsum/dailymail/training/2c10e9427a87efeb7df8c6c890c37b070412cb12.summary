by @entity0 published : 03:54 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 06:38 est , 30 january 2013 a @entity2 judge has rejected @entity4 's demand for a hike to the $ 1.05billion damages owed to it by @entity9 smartphone rival @entity8 in the two firms ongoing patent war			1
district judge @entity12 also rejected demands from both firms for another trial over claims @entity8 unfairly used @entity4 's @entity18 and @entity19 technology in knock - off products			1
she also upheld the validity of the @entity4 patents at the centre of the dispute			1
@entity25 - to - head : @entity8 's @entity28 smartphone , left , and @entity4 's @entity18 , right			1
a @entity2 judge yesterday slapped down @entity4 's demand for an increase to the $ 1billion damages owed by arch - rival @entity8 a jury last august found that @entity8 ' infringed ' six @entity4 patents to create and market 26 models of smartphones and computer tablets and ordered the $ 1.05billion award			1
the jury found several other older @entity8 products did not infringe any @entity4 patents			1
earlier , judge @entity43 refused to block sales of the infringing products in the @entity2 after she said @entity4 failed to show demand for the @entity8 devices was driven by the purloined technology , including the ' pinch - to - zoom ' function			1
@entity4 is appealing against that decision			0
@entity8 contends that only three of the 26 older - generation products are still offered for sale in the @entity2 @entity4 has filed a new lawsuit contending that @entity8 's current products are also using @entity4 technology			1
judge @entity43 scheduled a trial for that matter in 2014			1
in a series of four orders early today , the judge painstakingly considered each side 's myriad claims that the nine - member jury wrongly considered evidence and misread complex patent law			2
since @entity4 first took @entity8 to the court in early 2011 , @entity4 has been more successful in its @entity2 litigation campaign , winning the $ 1.05 billion damage award and a pre-trial sales ban on some @entity8 products			2
@entity8 has since fought back and scored some favourable rulings , including yesterday 's ruling that prevents any higher damages			2
the ruling also comes as investors worry @entity4 is losing its dominance in consumer electronics after it missed @entity83 revenue forecasts for the third consecutive quarter last week on weaker - than - expected @entity18 sales			0
by comparison , @entity8 , once seen as quick to copy the ideas of others , now sets the pace in innovation and widened its lead over @entity4 on the back of aggressive marketing of its wide product range last year			2
shares in @entity8 , the world 's top smartphone maker by units shipped , closed up 2.2 perc ent on wednesday in @entity100 , beating a 0.4 per cent gain in the wider market			0
with a few minor exceptions , the judge concluded that the jurors were right as far as the law goes			0
' accordingly , the trial was fairly conducted , with uniform time limits and rules of evidence applied to both sides , ' the judge said			0
' a new trial would be contrary to the interests of justice			2
' the judge is still considering @entity8 's demands to reduce the $ 1.05billion award			1
the jurors had filled out a verdict form listing damages @entity8 owed @entity4 for each of the 26 products it ruled used infringing technology			1
@entity8 argues that many of the line - item calculations were done incorrectly and that it was due a big reduction in the award			0
@entity4 spokeswoman @entity128 declined to comment and a @entity8 spokesman did not respond to emails			0
at a hearing in december , the judge seemed inclined to rework at least a few of the jury 's damages calculations , but gave no indication by what amount			0
the world 's top two smartphone makers , @entity4 and @entity8 and are locked in a no - holds - barred , global battle for supremacy of a market worth $ 346billion a year			2
lawyers for both sides have appeared in courts around the globe accusing each other of stealing technology and trade infractions			0
@entity150 released a report on friday showing smartphone shipments soared 36 per cent worldwide in the fourth quarter as the sleek devices supplanted personal computers and other gadgets on holiday shopping lists			0
@entity8 retained its bragging rights as the smartphone leader , shipping nearly 64million devices for a 29 per cent share of the global market			0
@entity4 ranked second with nearly 48million @entity18 shipped during the fourth quarter , translating into a market share of 22 per cent .			0

judge @entity12 also rejects demands for a fresh trial in the patent dispute as ' contrary to the interests of justice '
