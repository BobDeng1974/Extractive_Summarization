the @entity0 has disowned a @entity2 draft proposal that would have seen @entity4 - infected foreign nationals brought to the @entity5 for treatment			1
' no , ' @entity8 assistant press secretary @entity7 said flatly on wednesday evening when @entity9 asked if the plan was under consideration			2
' there are absolutely no plans to @entity15 non-americans who become ill with @entity4 to the @entity5 , ' said @entity7			1
' we have discussed allowing other countries to use our @entity15 capabilities to evacuate their own citizens to their home countries or third - countries , subject to reimbursement and availability			2
but we are not contemplating bringing them back to the @entity5 for treatment			2
' ' allegations to the contrary are completely false			0
' the four - page draft proposal , which surfaced wednesday morning , ' was drafted by a mid-level official , ' @entity7 added , ' but not cleared by senior leaders			1
it never came to senior officials for approval			0
' ' the @entity5 needs to show leadership and act as we are asking others to act by admitting certain non-citizens into the country for medical treatment for @entity4 ( @entity4 ) during the @entity4 crisis , ' the memo read			1
it spelled out the expected cost at $ 500,000 per patient , including $ 300,000 for medical treatment and $ 200,000 for transportation			1
the memo also said the @entity5 is considering a change in policy because some countries ' are implicitly or explicitly waiting for medevac assurances ' as a condition of sending their own doctors and nurses into the ebola hot zone – particularly countries that lack their own capacity to treat @entity4 patients			1
despite the existence of a written plan , the @entity2 had already denie that it had any intention of bringing @entity4 - infected noncitizens to the @entity5 for treatment			1
one official told the @entity83 that ' there is no policy of the @entity5 government to allow entry of non- @entity5 citizen @entity4 - infected to the @entity5			2
there is no consideration in the @entity2 of changing that policy			0
' @entity92 , deputy director of the @entity2 's @entity93 and @entity94 , wrote the memo , which advocates strongly for a policy that would allow the life - flights			0
@entity2 spokeswoman @entity98 told reporters on wednesday that the draft is ' weeks old ' and out of date because ' our @entity102 partners , since several weeks ago when that was written , have addressed this by providing a guarantee to international health workers that they would either be flown to @entity102 or receive high - quality treatment on the spot			1
' ' so it ’s not applicable at this point			0
' @entity38 @entity113 congressman @entity37 claimed on monday that the government was working on such a scheme , saying that was ' increasing evidence that they 're making those plans			1
' but the @entity40 administration offered a qualified denial on tuesday			0
' that certainly has n't happened so far , ' @entity0 press secretary @entity43 told reporters on tuesday			0
' i do n't know of any plans to do that			0
' @entity126 : ( left to to right ) dr. @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 were three of the first @entity5 to come home with @entity4 and go straight to hospital isolation – all three survived – but the next crop could be foreign nationals @entity37 's aides at the @entity135 , which he chairs , would n't discuss details			1
a committee aide told @entity9 only that a government official ' contacted our office about this proposed plan and chairman @entity37 has written to @entity142 and @entity143 seeking information about it			2
' the congressman 's october 21 letter demanded written records related to ' a plan to allow non- @entity5 citizens infected with @entity4 to enter the @entity5 to receive medical treatment			1
' @entity37 told @entity153 host @entity152 that while non-citizen @entity4 sufferers could be brought to the @entity5 on the same kind of aircraft that have already transported nine @entity5 to @entity157 and other treatment facilities , the risk of exposing @entity160 too great			1
' the disease needs to be contained where it is now , and people treated there , ' he said			0
the congressman is a strong advocate for a travel ban that would restrict the ability of people to reach the @entity5 from western @entity170 without a pre-travel quarantine , calling it ' simply a matter of common sense			2
' and ' if you are concerned about this problem spreading , ' he said , ' and this is a deadly disease that we 're even concerned about the great health care workers when they come back , not spreading it – we certainly should n't be bringing in the patients			0
' @entity183 , a center - right watchdog group , first raised the specter of @entity4 life - flights that could bring the disease into the interior of the @entity5 without involving a @entity5 citizen			1
the organization 's first online mention of the idea predated @entity37 's letter by four days			0
not only in @entity5 : @entity193 health authorities rushed a @entity195 national into isolation on tuesday after arriving in @entity198 city one day after @entity37 weighed in with @entity2 and @entity199 , @entity183 proposed a scenario where importing @entity202 ebola cases for treatment could be legal – by offering @entity4 - infected foreign nationals ' a special parole			1
' ' under federal regulations a parolee is an alien that is inadmissible to the inspecting officer but is allowed into the @entity5 for urgent humanitarian reasons , ' the group explained in a statement			0
' @entity40 applied this exemption to allow the recent influx of illegal immigrant minors that entered the country through the @entity219 border by labeling it a “ humanitarian crisis "			0
' ' besides “ urgent humanitarian reasons , ” parole can be authorized at @entity199 headquarters for “ medical emergency , ” according to the agency ’s regulations			0
this could apply to foreign nationals infected with @entity4			2
' admitting @entity230 treatment uploaded by @entity9			0

*unclassified* @entity2 outline spelled out a scheme that would have cost $ 300,000 to treat each patient and $ 200,000 for transportation
@entity8 *disavowed* the proposal , telling @entity9 that it ' was drafted by a mid-level official , but not cleared by senior leaders '
some countries are ' waiting for @entity15 assurances ' from the @entity5 before they will send doctors and nurses to @entity170 , the *document* said
now the @entity2 says @entity102 countries have made that issue moot by providing their own guarantees of medical treatment
@entity38 rep. @entity37 had claimed foreign nationals with @entity4 would get red - carpet treatment in @entity5 despite @entity5 *public* health risks
@entity183 *nonprofit* first raised the issue a week ago
