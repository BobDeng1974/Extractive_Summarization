by @entity0 published : 03:57 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 11 january 2013 astronomers have discovered the biggest spiral galaxy yet seen - and say it may be now giving birth to a new , smaller galaxy thanks to a collision with another			1
the spectacular barred spiral galaxy @entity8 has ranked among the biggest stellar systems for decades , but a new analysis has know crowned it the largest known spiral			1
measuring tip - to - tip across its two out - sized spiral arms , @entity8 spans more than 522,000 light years - more than five times bigger than the @entity15			1
giving birth : a previously unsuspected tidal dwarf galaxy candidate ( circled ) appears only in the ultraviolet off the north - west arm of @entity8 , indicating the presence of many hot young stars			1
@entity23 4970 , the small disc galaxy interacting with @entity8 , is located above the spiral 's central region and a comparatively recent collision with another galaxy may now be causing one outer arm of the spiral to spawn fresh stars that may eventually break away into new galaxy			1
a team of astronomers from @entity35 , @entity36 and the @entity37 made the new findings based on an examination of archival data from @entity42 's @entity41 ( @entity41 ) satellite			0
' without @entity41 's ability to detect the ultraviolet light of the youngest , hottest stars , we would never have recognized the full extent of this intriguing system , ' said lead scientist @entity50			2
he presented the findings thursday at the @entity52 meeting in @entity53 , @entity54			0
six new comets described as ' a missing link ' of the formation of planets , have been spotted in other star systems			0
the discovery more than doubles the number of comets known outside the home solar system and suggests they are just as common as planets			0
the comets , or exocomets as they are called when in other solar systems , are left over from a time when planets were forming			0
most comets that were formed around a star would have been absorbed by new planets the ones that can be seen now are thought to be left over – the cosmic equivalent of builders ’ rubble			0
finding new exocomets is thought to be a clue to astronomers that a star is likely to have planets orbiting it			0
the galaxy 's unusual size and appearance stem from its interaction with a much smaller disk galaxy named @entity8 , which has only about one - fifth the mass of @entity8			1
the odd couple is located 212million light - years from @entity89 in the southern constellation @entity91			2
astronomers think large galaxies , including our own , grew through mergers and acquisitions - assembling over billions of years by absorbing numerous smaller systems			0
intriguingly , the gravitational interaction of @entity8 and @entity8 may have done the opposite , spawning what may develop into a new small galaxy			2
' the northeastern arm of @entity8 is the most disturbed and is rippling with star formation , but at its far end , visible only in the ultraviolet , is an object that appears to be a tidal dwarf galaxy similar to those seen in other interacting systems , ' said team member @entity109 , a professor of astronomy at @entity113			1
the tidal dwarf candidate is brighter in the ultraviolet than other regions of the galaxy , a sign it bears a rich supply of hot young stars less than 200million years old			2
the researchers studied the galaxy across the spectrum using archival data from the @entity126 's @entity125 , the @entity127 , and @entity42 's @entity128 , as well as @entity41			0
by analysing the distribution of energy by wavelength , the team uncovered a distinct pattern of stellar age along the galaxy 's two prominent spiral arms			0
the youngest stars appear in the far end of the northwestern arm , within the tidal dwarf candidate , and stellar ages skew progressively older toward the galaxy 's centre			2
the southwestern arm displays the same pattern , which is likely connected to waves of star formation triggered by the galactic encounter			0
cosmic collision : simulations show how the collision between @entity8 and @entity8 produced the features of the galaxies as we see them today			2
@entity8 4970 's closest encounter occurred 130million years ago and the smaller galaxy followed a path ( dashed curve ) close to the plane of the spiral 's disc and in the same direction it rotates a 2007 study by @entity163 at @entity164 in @entity165 and @entity166 of the @entity167 developed computer simulations of the collision that reproduced the overall appearance of the system as we see it today			1
according to the closest match , @entity8 made its closest approach about 130million years ago and followed a path that took it nearly along the plane of the spiral 's disk in the same direction it rotates			1
as in all barred spirals , @entity8 contains a stellar bar component that transitions between the spiral arms and the galaxy 's central regions			1
measuring about 26,000 light years in radius , or about twice the average length found in nearby barred spirals , it is a bar that befits a giant galaxy			1
the team found no sign of recent star formation along the bar , which indicates it formed at least a few billion years ago			0
its aged stars provide a fossil record of the galaxy 's stellar population before the encounter with @entity8 stirred things up			1
' understanding the structure and dynamics of nearby interacting systems like this one brings us a step closer to placing these events into their proper cosmological context , paving the way to decoding what we find in younger , more distant systems , ' said team member and @entity214 astrophysicist @entity212 .			0

new analysis shows @entity8 is the largest known spiral galaxy
it spans 522,000 light years - five times bigger than the @entity15
batch of fresh stars in one arm may have been caused by galactic collision
