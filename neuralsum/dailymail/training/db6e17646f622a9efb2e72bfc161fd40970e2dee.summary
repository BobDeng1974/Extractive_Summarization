by @entity0 published : 10:13 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 04:40 est , 21 september 2013 a ' selfish ' couple who wiped out a 91 - year - old dementia sufferer ’s life savings by helping themselves to her bank accounts were jailed for two and a half years today			1
@entity6 , 56 , and husband @entity7 , 55 , spent all but £ 3,000 of her godmother @entity9 ’s £ 130,000 savings after the pensioner allowed them to become a signatory on her bank accounts			1
the judge said they were guilty of a gross breach of trust and although they had been hard - working throughout their lives , he branded them ' utterly materialistic			1
' arriving at court : @entity7 and @entity6 , who spent two years splashing her elderly godmother 's cash , were jailed toady the couple cleared debts , bought a car for one of their two sons and spent thousands on electrical goods and presents for themselves , @entity25 heard during their trial last month			1
they also spent some of the money converting the garage of their home in @entity40 into a wet room and gym , but told police the work was really to make it into a bedroom for ' @entity47 , who by then was living in a care home			1
they claimed they loved @entity49 and said she was happy for them to spend her savings as they saw fit , as she planned to leave them everything in her will			2
but while the @entity55 spent tens of thousands on their family home , miss @entity9 lived in a sparsely - decorated room in a care home			1
on one occasion she asked for her personal effects to be brought in , but when the @entity55 failed to do so , a member of staff went out and bought her some earrings and a jewellery box			1
the couple held hands in the dock as they were sentenced by judge @entity69 , the recorder of @entity71 today			2
he told them : ' you were found guilty by the jury on compelling evidence			1
' what the jury concluded you did was to strip all the monies that your godmother , mrs @entity6 , had			2
' you did so for your own selfish needs			0
' the court heard that as a result of the @entity55 actions @entity49 , who is still alive , is now relying on the state to pay for her care costs			1
judge @entity69 : ' you believed , and you may be right in believing , that she was going to leave all her money to you			0
' but you pre-empted that process by deciding to take the money for yourself , at a time when you felt you needed it			0
' the judge accepted some money was spent doing up the @entity49 's home , as well as their own , but he said they expected to one day inherit that too , and were renting it out in the meantime to make money for themselves			2
he added : ' you claimed you loved her , that you cared for her , that you effectively nurtured her and that you did nothing to harm her			0
' you did none of that			0
' home improvements : @entity108 heard how @entity109 and mrs @entity110 used the money they stole to convert their garage into a gym and wet room but lied to police claiming the work was to make room for @entity49 he also pointed out that the visits @entity109 and mrs @entity6 made to the care home became more infrequent once the money ran out but the couple blamed this on a fall - out with the staff			1
he said : ' this is a gross breach of trust			1
' ' you have shown throughout these proceedings not one ounce of remorse			0
' i have seen nothing , not even a flicker of regret for what you have done , indeed , quite the reverse			0
' the judge acknowledged that imposing jail on two people of previous good character and of their age would be hard , and that they had lost their good name			0
but he added : ' you no doubt feel you have done well , you have been hard - working			2
but you are utterly materialistic			0
mr @entity144 had claimed it was a coincidence that when police arrested the couple in a dawn raid , the gym contained a treadmill and exercise ball , and maintained the conversion was intended for @entity49			0
that story was rejected by the jury who convicted them of stealing £ 95,000 in savings , and theft of rent money they made from getting a tenant to move into her property when she went into care after a fall			2
mrs @entity6 was also convicted of stealing £ 2,940 in pension payments			2
@entity166 , defending mr @entity144 , said the couple will find it very difficult to be apart in jail having spent their lives together			0
he also claimed that mr @entity144 , an engineer was likely to lose his job			0
he said : ' life will be very difficult for mr @entity144 when he is released , ' the couple now face a proceeds of crime hearing which will see them stripped of their assets			0
@entity178 , defending mrs @entity6 said : ' she will lose her reputation , her assets including her home , her self - esteem and perhaps her mental health			1

@entity6 , 56 , and husband @entity7 , 55 , bought cars , presents and converted their garage into a wet room
meanwhile their 91 - year - old godmother @entity9 lived in a sparsely *furnished* room in a care home
she is now *dependent* on the state to pay her care home costs
the @entity55 were found guilty of a gross breach of trust and jailed for two and a half years
