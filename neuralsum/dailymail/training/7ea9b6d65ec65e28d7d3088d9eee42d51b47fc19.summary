the firm tracks billions of anonymous transactions from customers , which it then aggregates into small segments which comprise of similar transactions			1
this allows the firm to sell details of these very specific ' segments ' of data to advertisers			2

' instead they are treating details of our personal behaviour like their own property to be bundled up and sold on without any regard to what customers might want			1
the slides reveal that @entity1 collects transaction from its customer to use to target advertisments at them ' have @entity1 made any effort to seek customer ’s consent for processing their shopping habits and selling it on ? how do consumers opt out ? it ’s exactly this kind of behaviour that leads consumers to question whether companies are more interested in their own profit than respecting people ’s privacy			1
