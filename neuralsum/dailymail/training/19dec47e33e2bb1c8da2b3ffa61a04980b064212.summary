a seven - year - old cancer victim is being given a final chance to beat the disease - thanks to his little three - year - old brother			1
@entity4 has been fighting leukaemia since he was four and has already defeated it - and a bout of meningitis - once before			1
but a routine check up revealed the leukaemia had returned and the only potential treatment in the @entity11 is a bone marrow transplant			1
@entity4 's three - year - old brother @entity13 has now agreed to donate his own bone marrow in the hopes of saving his sibling 's life			1
close : @entity4 , seven , pictured right , is about to undergo a bone marrow transplant after his three - year - old brother @entity13 , pictured left , agreed to be his donor @entity22 will undergo the operation to donate his bone marrow to @entity4 next month - who will then hopefully be able to produce the white blood cells his body desperately needs			1
but if the treatment is unsuccessful , the family will have to start looking abroad at other treatments not currently available in the @entity11			0
their mother @entity32 , 31 , from @entity34 , said : ' @entity4 has been very brave			2
i have explained everything to him because i think he had a right to know			0
' i heard him telling his friend that he was going to have an operation and if that does n’t work he would be going to heaven			0
' he is only seven - he should n’t have to be thinking about things like that			0
' @entity4 was first diagnosed with the horrific disease when he was just four , but bravely fought it off with the help of months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy			2
hopeful : mother @entity32 , pictured with her two sons , hopes the bone marrow transplant with enable her eldest son @entity4 to create the white blood cells his body desperately needs he then developed meningitis during his treatment , forcing him to stay in @entity60 for a month			1
having battled through two life - threatening illnesses , his family were delighted when doctors finally told him he was clear of cancer			2
but last november a routine check - up revealed the leukaemia had returned			1
mother - of - four mrs @entity4 said : ' it ’s been quite hard			2
when @entity4 was first diagnosed with leukaemia i also had a five - week - old baby to look after			2
' as first i thought it was just a virus			0
i had taken him in for blood tests and a few days later i had a letter saying he was anaemic			0
last chance : the bone marrow transplant from his brother @entity13 is @entity4 's final chance of treating the illness in the @entity11			1
if it is unsuccessful , the family will need to raise £ 10,000 so he can undergo a pioneering therapy in the @entity86 ' we went into hospital , but i had n’t realised what i was taking him in for			0
a doctor took me to a little room and told me			0
i was obviously very upset			0
' mrs @entity4 has been warned that if the bone marrow transplant fails , the @entity93 does not offer any further treatment			1
but she has learned of a pioneering therapy called @entity97 , which has helped children like @entity4 , but is only available in the @entity86 the therapy involves a photosensitiser drug which once in the body reacts to light by producing a highly destructive form of oxygen which can destroy a tumour			0
the treatment would cost up to £ 10,000 and @entity32 ’s friends are fundraising - just in case @entity22 ’s bone marrow donation is not successful .			1
