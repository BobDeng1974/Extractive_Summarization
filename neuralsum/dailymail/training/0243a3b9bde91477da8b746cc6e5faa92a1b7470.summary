by @entity0 published : 12:14 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 03:12 est , 9 august 2012 it is meant to be the happiest day of your life			2
so @entity4 , 32 , and @entity5 , 30 , must be having an extremely happy year			1
the @entity7 couple have been travelling the world since last summer and celebrating their love for each other by having 22 wedding ceremonies in different countries - and they still have eight to go			1
@entity4 and @entity5 pictured with their campervan @entity16 , left , and at the ceremony that started everything in @entity19 , right what 's more , the pair say they are now more in love than ever			1
so far they have been hitched among dolphins in @entity26 , dressed as vampires in @entity28 , on an island in @entity30 , in a crayfish - riddled lake in @entity33 , in a vineyard in @entity35 , on the beach in @entity37 , on horseback in @entity38 and in 15 other locations around @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			0
speaking to @entity43 , the couple - who have known each other for 11 years and been dating for six - said : ' the idea came as we looked for a place to get married before we left our lives behind to travel around the world for two years			2
' the wedding opportunities offered to us in the @entity53 did not suit what we wanted , so we decided to look for the perfect place to wed while we travelled			2
' after a glass of wine or two the idea grew , and we made a decision to have a small ceremony in every country we visited , with the local cultures and traditions in mind			0
' at the end of our trip ( which we have just extended to three years ) we will choose our favourite place to officially " tie the knot " ! ' @entity70 petals and romance aboard an old ship in @entity73 , left , and in @entity74 , right , where the couple say the ceremony was the most emotional , touching and beautiful old fashioned romance at a flower market in @entity79 where local professional photographer @entity80 helped them capture one of their special days ever since their first wedding in @entity19 ( which @entity4 organised as a surprise for @entity5 ) , the couple have kept an online blog about the travels , and professional photographers have helped document the trip			1
anyone who wishes to attend one of their ceremonies can request an invitation on their blog			2
to fund the trip @entity4 and @entity5 and sold both the car repair shop @entity4 owned and their home			1
sticking to a strict weekly budget they have been travelling and living in their 25 - year - old @entity107 campervan , called @entity16 , which has cut out any costs for accommodation			0
@entity4 said : ' the budget is very tight but we are managing			2
our biggest cost is fuel , obviously , and we do a weekly shop at local markets to reducing our living costs			0
' and of course we could not even begin to afford to throw a wedding every other week if it was not for the generosity of the photographers , suppliers , families and people we meet on our journey			0
' everyone helps us for free or a minimal cost as they want to help us spread the love and to be a part of our adventure ! ' from a blood - soaked vampire wedding in @entity132 , left to spellbinding local rituals in @entity134 , right			0
the couple have stuck to a strict budget to enable their travels the couple - who have known each other for 11 years and been dating for six - get in to character and a bit of local costume in the @entity145 country of @entity146 when asked about any problems they have encountered along the way , the couple say making repairs to @entity16 has been the biggest hurdle			0
' making repairs to @entity16 has been our biggest hurdle , ' they said			0
' we bought her in @entity157 and have covered over 55,000km so far			2
we have only had minimal problems but they have been difficult to solve with the language barriers ! ' with regards to the wedding side of the journey , everyone has been so accommodating and we have had very few obstacles , only once were we turned away for a ceremony for not having commited to the same religious beliefs as the local church			2
' and even then the church invited us to attend mass and dedicated that evenings prayers to us and our travels and commitments to each other			0
' the couple say their @entity74 wedding was ' the most emotional , touching and stunningly beautiful ; and therefore probably their favourite , and that one of the trickiest to organise was in @entity180 , where they wanted to hold a ceremony in the @entity183 district with help from local @entity186 people , but where a week - long torrential downpour and a photographer stuck 600km away hampered proceedings			1
' we were about ready to give up when the sun came out just in time for the wedding ! it was a beautiful day and we learned such an important lesson about the things we take for granted ! ' the couple 's trusty campervan @entity16 joins them at the drive - thru chapel in @entity200 , left , and a blustery beach is the perfect backdrop in @entity203 , right ( l - r ) a @entity157 ranch wedding in @entity38 ( complete with leather chaps and a @entity206 ) , saying their vows riverside in @entity180 and a romantic sunset in @entity210 luckily , the couple say the only unpleasant wedding guests they have had have been ' a thousand banana spiders in @entity30 on the island of @entity216 , and maybe a couple of smelly drunk fishermen in @entity218 '			1
even more luckily , they say they are still as much in love as they were when their adventure began			0
' and probably more so ! we are together 24 hours a day , seven days a week and live in a van			0
we arrange weddings , share the driving , split the blog workload and take it turns to make each other breakfast in bed every day			1
' if there is anything that makes you know you are meant to be together it is surviving this trip without a single argument			0
we still get nervous before every single ceremony ! ' @entity4 and @entity5 are running a competition with @entity240 and @entity241 to fly two people out to their final destination wedding			1
to enter , visit their blog www.2people1life.com a local photographer gets arty with some underwater effects in @entity37 , left , and the couple toast their second wedding at a vineyard in @entity35 , right @entity5 looks out of place against a backdrop in @entity180			1
the couple say the only unpleasant wedding guests they have had have been ' a thousand banana spiders in @entity30 on the island of @entity216 , and maybe a couple of smelly drunk fishermen in @entity218 ' a dolphin joins in the slightly soggy celebrations in @entity26 , left , and the couple pose for another cinematic shot in @entity146 after the ceremony , right two snaps from their trip to @entity268 , @entity157			1
the couple admit that they still get pre-wedding jitters before every single ceremony , even after 22 times ! ( @entity274 ) @entity5 throws a bouquet in the industrial surroundings of @entity268 airport before the couple head south to the @entity37 coast and then on to @entity280 in @entity280 the couple are dressed in the colourful clothes as they are blessed			1
