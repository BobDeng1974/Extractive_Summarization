by @entity0 published : 09:35 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:17 est , 3 february 2014 as if they needed any more excuse , new research suggests men need their sleep if they ’re to live a long life			2
women , on the other hand , can live long lives despite poor sleep habits as long as they eat a diverse diet that includes vitamin b6 and plenty of vegetables			1
@entity17 can be found in food such as meat , bananas , nuts , garlic and pistachios			1
among other things , it allows the body to use and store energy from protein and carbohydrates			0
good sleep patterns can help men live longer , but women will only benefit if they also have a diverse diet the findings come from a study led by @entity37 - based @entity36 which looked at how diet contributed to sleep quality and mortality among elderly men and women			1
emeritus professor @entity43 from @entity36 said sleep played a more important role in men ’s mortality than women ’s			1
' poor sleep has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality including obesity , diabetes , cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease , ' he said			2
‘ we found that for both genders , poor sleep was strongly correlated with poor appetite and poor perceived health			2
' women , on the other hand , can live long lives despite poor sleep habits as long as they eat a diverse diet that includes vitamin b6 and plenty of vegetables			1
@entity17 can be found in food such as meat , bananas , nuts , garlic and pistachios the amount and type of sleep a person needs changes as they get older			1
it is n’t always how long someone sleeps for that matters , but the quality of sleep			0
someone 's need for sleep can also change from day to day depending on the challenges face			0
in general , @entity88 suggests adults need between seven and eight hours of sleep			0
however , some people can function after sleeping for much less time			0
@entity93 , chief executive of @entity94 claims that a complete sleep cycle typically takes about 90 minutes			0
the rule of thumb is that you need 4 - 5 full sleep cycles			0
but there is no evidence that all seven to nine hours have to occur in a single bout			0
but the researchers also found a significant relationship between a diverse diet and sleep , particularly in women			1
‘ for women , good sleep only provides a survival advantage if they had a diverse diet , ’ said professor @entity43			1
the study found women were almost twice as likely as men to sleep badly			1
women who were poor sleepers had a lower intake of vitamin b6 from food than those whose sleep was rated ' fair ' or ' good '			1
fair sleepers had lower iron intakes than good sleepers			0
both men and women could improve their outlook by eating a more varied diet , the research said			2
‘ sufficient dietary diversity in men could offset the adverse effect on mortality of poor sleep while women need to make sure they are eating foods high in vitamin @entity17 , ’ said professor @entity128			1
participants in the study who did not sleep well were also less able to chew , had poor appetites , and did less physical activity			1
‘ these characteristics could contribute to lower overall dietary quality and food and nutrient intake , especially for vegetables , protein - rich foods , and vitamin @entity17 , ’ professor @entity43 said			2
‘ they may also contribute to the risk of death , either in their own right or together with problematic sleep			0
intervention focusing on education on healthy dietary practices in elderly people could improve sleep duration and provide more stable levels of health			0
’ the study was conducted on 1865 elderly men and women who were a part of the @entity164 survey in @entity165			2
the data was collected from 1999 - 2000 .			0

sleep plays a far more important role in men ’s mortality than in women ’s
for women , sleep only provides a survival advantage if they have @entity17 in diet
@entity17 can be found in food such as meat , bananas , nuts garlic and pistachios
elderly participants in the study who did not sleep well were also less able to chew , had poor appetites , and did less physical activity
