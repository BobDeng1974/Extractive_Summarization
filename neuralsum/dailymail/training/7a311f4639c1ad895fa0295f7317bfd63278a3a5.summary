by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 14:58 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 14:58 est , 22 august 2012 a witness testified at @entity5 's murder trial today that the former @entity7 police officer offered him $ 25,000 to hire a hit man to kill his third wife just three months before she was found dead			1
prosecutors allege that @entity5 , 58 , killed @entity11 himself because he feared a settlement after their divorce would ruin him , but they presented the hit - man testimony in a bid to establish that he had thought seriously about her murder in advance			1
@entity18 told the jury that @entity5 asked him to locate a hit man during a late night ride in his squad car in the @entity24 suburb			2
@entity5 trial : another pathologist stated that @entity27 could not have been killed as a result of falling because of the large gash at the back of her head power house : attorney @entity33 , far right , leaves the @entity34 with his prosecution team as the @entity5 murder trial continues @entity27 was found dead in a bathtub in her suburban @entity24 home with a gash on the back of her head in march 2004 , just three months later			1
' he asked if i could find someone to take care of his third wife , ' said @entity18 , who worked with the @entity47 police sergeant when he was moonlighting at a cable company			2
' he indicated that he would give me the $ 25,000 and if i could find someone to do it for less i could keep the remaining balance			0
' the two agreed on a code word that he would use to let @entity5 know when the deed was done			2
@entity18 said he could n't remember the exact word but that it had something to do with cookies			0
prosecutors , who say they could rest within several days , have no physical evidence , so they are trying to build a circumstantial case that leads jurors to conclude @entity5 must have killed @entity27			1
her death was initially ruled an accident but was reclassified a homicide after @entity5 's fourth wife , @entity66 , went missing in 2007			1
@entity5 is a suspect in @entity66 's disappearance but has n't been charged in her case			1
@entity5 hunched forward in his @entity70 courtroom seat and appeared to listen intently to @entity18 , 38 , who spoke in a firm , monotone voice			2
@entity18 said the officer also told him to let him know when the hit was scheduled so he could arrange a plausible alibi			2
grave charges : @entity5 is accused of murdering @entity11 , left			1
it was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub , right , but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide one idea @entity5 mentioned was starting a fight at an amusement park on the day so there would be a record he was there			0
and he told the jury @entity5 warned him to keep the plan quiet			2
' he told me at the end of the ride along that , " this is something you will take to your grave " , ' @entity18 said			0
during cross-examination , defense attorney @entity98 pressed @entity18 on his criminal record , which includes a conviction for sexual abuse , and accused him of inventing his story for personal profit			0
' it 's hard to remember things when you are making them up , is n't it ? ' @entity98 asked when @entity18 said he could n't recall details of an earlier statement			0
' you want your 15 minutes of fame , do n't you ? ' @entity18 shot back : ' no , i do not			0
' @entity18 conceded he had a hard time telling if @entity5 was serious about the request , describing him as prone to kidding around and that he was always calm no matter the situation			0
forensic pathologist @entity115 told jurors he did n't believe a single , fatal slip could explain how @entity27 had a fresh gash on the back of her head and , he said , he took no steps to act on the request			1
@entity18 had n't heard that @entity27 was dead when he called @entity5 in july 2004 to ask how his newest wife , @entity66 , and their kids were doing			1
' he said his family was doing good , ' said @entity18			0
' after that , he said , ' the favor that i asked you — i do n't need it anymore			2
'' prosecutors ' only witness yesterday was pathologist @entity135 , who testified that a two - inch gash on the back of @entity27 's head could not have caused her to pass out			1
that counters defense suggestions that @entity27 slipped in her bathtub , hit her head , lost consciousness and drowned			2
as @entity146 spoke , prosecutors projected autopsy photos of @entity27 's head with the top half of her skull cut away and some jurors shifted uncomfortably in their seats			1
the wound penetrated the thick layer of skin around the skull , @entity146 told jurors , but caused no damage to the brain			0
' there was no brain trauma ... no internal brain injury that would have caused a loss of consciousness , ' @entity146 said			0
case is one of several forensic experts to testify as prosecutors seek to prove that @entity27 was murdered			0
she said @entity27 would have had to fall hard three separate times to account for deep bruises on the front of her body and the injury to the back of her head			1
but the judge upheld a defense objection about that comment and told jurors to disregard it			0
last week , another pathologist testified last week , saying he did n't believe a single , fatal slip could explain how @entity27 had a fresh gash on the back of her head and a pattern of deep bruises on the front of her bod ‘ i could n't see how that could happen , ’ dr @entity115 testified			1
@entity115 , a key witness for the state , was subject to aggressive questioning by the defense later in the day			0
over the objections of prosecutors , the judge let defense attorney @entity200 ask if three other pathologists who reviewed autopsy data still held @entity27 died accidentally			0
missing : @entity5 , left , is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity66 , right march 20 , 2010 : @entity5 stands in the bedroom of the home from where his fourth wife , @entity66 , disappeared from in 2007 ‘ despite their opinion , you say homicide ? ’ the attorney asked			1
' i have n't changed my opinion , ’ @entity115 responded			0
@entity115 also denied @entity200 's suggestion that he manipulated his autopsy results to mesh with @entity34 state 's attorney @entity33 's theory that @entity27 was murdered			2
@entity115 testified earlier that @entity27 's circular tub also had no edges pronounced enough to cause the two - inch , straight - line wound on her head			1
also , the position of @entity27 's body in the tub - face down and with her feet jammed against the sides of the tub - did not support a theory that she slipped and hit the back of her head , he said			1
@entity5 , a 58 - year - old former suburban @entity24 police officer , has pleaded not guilty to first - degree murder in @entity27 's death			1
he is also a suspect in @entity66 's disappearance , although he has never been charged in her case			0
authorities presume she is dead , though a body has never been found .			0

@entity5 pleaded not guilty to murdering his third wife , @entity11 , in 2004
only charged with @entity27 's murder after his fourth wife went missing
police officer said @entity5 told him ' he did n't need the favor anymore '
another pathologist testified saying the gash at the back of @entity27 's head was not *consistent* with falling over
the *coroner* said @entity27 's circular tub had no edges that would cause a straight - line wound
