a team of zookeepers spent tuesday morning doing something most people would n't dare to – raiding the nests of full - grown female alligators , which were adamant to protect their young			2
the annual raids at the @entity8 in @entity9 on the @entity11 central coast , could see up to 500 eggs collected this season from the nests of 30 odd resident female @entity16 alligators , which can grow to be up to three metres long			1
obviously an incredibly dangerous procedure , the raids require three keepers to restrain a female by wrestling her and tying her up with ropes , while a fourth removes up to 60 eggs from each nest			1
' the last week or so we 've been practicing			0
it sounds stupid , but we literally put a blow - up alligator or crocodile on the ground and we practiced our jumps , our roping			0
' as if the job was n't hard enough , keepers were surprised to find an unusual sight during this year 's raids , with one nest housing the eggs of two female alligators – making for double the wrestling			1
' there 's also the added problem of @entity61 … a young male rogue that we 've had problems with in the past			0
he 's been charging keepers and is quite hostile , ' a spokesperson for the park said			0
the eggs require incubation for up to 70 days as temperatures often prevent them from hatching naturally in the @entity8 climate success : incubation also protects the eggs from hungry lizards and other alligators who are cannibalistic by nature the raids require three keepers to restrain a female by wrestling and tying her up , while a fourth removes the eggs from her nest ' @entity16 alligators have one of the strongest jaw pressures of any animal and one bite can be limb or even life - threatening			1
' normally @entity16 alligators guard their young until they hatch , at which point they gently take them in their mouths to the water where they teach them survival skills as they grow , but in @entity99 they require a helping - hand due to the hot climate			2
the eggs require incubation for up to 70 days from between 29 to 32 degrees , as hot @entity8 temperatures often prevent them from hatching naturally			1
it also further protects the eggs by guarding them from hungry lizards and ensuring that , once born , the young do n't escape the alligator enclosure			0
however , the biggest threats to the baby alligators are actually their own kind due to the species being cannibalistic			0
the @entity8 is the only zoo in @entity99 that breeds @entity16 alligators			2
it supplies zoos both nationally and internationally			0
