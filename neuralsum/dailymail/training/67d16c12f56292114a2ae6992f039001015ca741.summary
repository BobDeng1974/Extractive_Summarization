this will crush many people 's hopes of owning their own home			0
on the up : the @entity6 has today changed its predictions for house price rises to 8.2 % , with the cost peaking in 2015 but @entity21 said in his @entity8 today than the @entity6 's new forecasts still left real house prices 3.1 % lower than their 2007 peak			1

message : mr @entity21 used his @entity8 to say that he would get house building moving but admitted there was a ' shortage of supply ' mr @entity21 said : ' some of the most important infrastructure for @entity3 families is housing and we have to confront this simple truth : if we want more people to own a home , we have to build more homes			2
' and the @entity6 is absolutely right today to draw attention to the weakness of housing supply in this country			1
' the good news is the latest survey data showed residential construction growing at its fastest rate for a decade			0
and our hard - won planning reforms are delivering a 35 % increase in approvals for new homes			2
' but we need to do more			0
' the @entity58 borrowing limit will be raised by £ 300 million for councils , which will also be encouraged to sell off their most expensive properties to fund more cost - effective homes			1
mr @entity21 said : ' aspiration is n't only for people who can afford their own home			0
we want to regenerate some of our most run - down urban housing estates			2

' we are going to give working people in social housing a priority right to move if they need to for a job			2
' right to buy applications have doubled under this government and we 'll expand it more			0
' the @entity6 noted that the growth in residential investment had left household finances in deficit and the gross debt to income ratio rising			2
its report said that was consistent with low interest rates and schemes such as help to buy but ' may pose risks to the sustainability of the recovery over the medium term '			0
mr @entity21 acknowledged that the market should be ' functioning ' but ' stable ' and the @entity93 had powers to deal with any housing bubble			0
rising high : house prices surged by 6.5 per cent year - on - year in november alone , according to the @entity97 he said : ' help to aspiring families and building more homes - that 's what we stand for			0
but we must also avoid the mistakes of the last decade			0

' that is why i am the first chancellor to give the @entity93 the responsibility and the power not only to monitor overall debt levels , but to take action to deal with asset bubbles if they threaten our stability			0
' we want a functioning , stable housing market			0
' the @entity6 's latest house price forecast , while higher , still has real house prices 3.1 % lower in 2018 than at their peak in 2007			1
' the @entity122 's coffers will receive a boost from the buoyant housing market , with revenues from capital gains and stamp taxes forecast to increase			0

we now expect receipts to almost double over the forecast period , from £ 8.9 billion in 2013/14 to £ 16.8 billion in 2018/19			0
' comparison : this graph shows how the @entity6 predictions were much lower in march this year compared to today by 2017/18 higher house prices will contribute around £ 1.8 billion to the forecast , while a higher volume of transactions will add £ 1 billion to receipts			1
increasing prices will mean ' a greater proportion of transactions ' become subject to higher stamp duty bands , the @entity6 added			1
@entity145 , chairman of the @entity147 's environment and housing board , said the measures would ' provide a glimmer of hope ' to people facing lengthy waits for a council house			1
' government has today acknowledged councils ' argument that the current restrictions on our ability to invest in new housing are not fit for purpose , ' he said			2

the policy will save £ 500 off a £ 2,500 bill .			1

prices will go up 5.2 % in 2014 , 7.2 % in 2015 and be 10 % higher by 2018
