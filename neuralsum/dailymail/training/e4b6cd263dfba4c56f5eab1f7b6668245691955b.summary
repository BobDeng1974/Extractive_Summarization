@entity2 was miffed by @entity5 ’s decision , particularly because he was led to believe in the weeks leading up to @entity9 ’s introduction that he would be joining @entity5 on the @entity14 presidential ticket , @entity10 reported , citing conversations with ‘ campaign insiders			1
’ now @entity14 bosses suspect @entity2 's momentary embrace of @entity19 during the president 's tour of devastated @entity3 this week was a deliberate snub to @entity5			1
@entity2 was vetted so hard by the @entity5 campaign in july that even some of @entity5 ’s top advisers believed the @entity3 governor was the final choice as the @entity14 vice presidential candidate			1
but @entity5 changed his mind over the course of two weeks this summer , advisers told @entity10 , and instead offered the job to @entity9 , a @entity14 congressman from @entity33			1
@entity5 was attracted to @entity2 for his unfiltered style that has helped turn him into rising star – albeit a controversial one -- within the @entity14			1
the explosive @entity3 native has a propensity toward swearing , making him a bit of a liability for @entity5 , but he also has a knack for appealing to middle class voters , with whom @entity5 has had a hard time connecting			1
at a campaign event for @entity5 in @entity46 last december , @entity2 bullied ' occupy ' protestors out of a rally , leading @entity5 supporters to start chanting @entity2 's name as they cheered with approval			2
' you know what , we ’re used to dealing with jokers like this in @entity3 all the time , ' @entity2 shouted at the protesters as they were led out of the rally by @entity5 staffers			2
' so you guys go all out and chant and do what it is that you want to do			2
' you are so angry , are n’t ya ? ' @entity2 badgered			2
' it ’s so terrible ... oh work it out			1
work it all out for yourselves			2
work it all out for yourselves			2
@entity2 would consistently arrive late at campaign events that he was attending on behalf of @entity5 and he would spend the majority of his speaking time on himself , not the @entity14 presidential candidate			1
@entity5 advisers began to think that @entity2 would n’t know how to be a ‘ number two ’ and they suddenly stopped vetting him without explanation just before @entity5 ’s trip to @entity97 over the summer			2
when @entity5 returned , he offered the job to @entity9 and waited another week to let @entity2 know , just shortly before announcing his pick publicly			0
@entity2 has since been quietly retaliating against the @entity5 campaign for his sudden fall from favor , political analysts say			0
@entity2 made news for his scarce mentions of @entity5 during his speech at the @entity106			0
campaigning : @entity2 and @entity5 talking to voters in @entity108			0
@entity5 changed his mind about putting the @entity3 governor on the @entity14 ticket ‘ his view was , “ they saw the speech before i gave it			1
they said it was fine , ” ’ a @entity5 adviser told @entity10			0
‘ and the campaign ’s view was , “ we told him that we thought there were more opportunities for him to put in stuff about @entity5 , and he did n’t take the hint			0
” there was a lot of agitation that led to a lot of sarcasm and the kind of comments that people do n’t mean , but they kind of do			0
’ @entity2 heaped praise on @entity19 after he was invited onto @entity135 to tour the wreckage left behind by the storm			0
‘ this was as comfortable and relaxed an interaction as i ’ve had with the president since i ’ve known him , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ and i think it ’s ’ cause we ’re both doing what we wanted to do , which is to get things done			0
’ @entity2 said he expected to be criticized for complimenting the president			1
‘ but you know what , i speak the truth , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s what i always do			0
sometimes you guys like it , sometimes you do n’t			0
sometimes politicians like it , sometimes they do n’t			0
but i say what i feel and what i believe			1
' and i ’m just doing the same thing with the president of the @entity163			1
so , i do pinch myself every day			0
you know , like when i got on @entity165 ? i ’m pinching myself , believe me			0
