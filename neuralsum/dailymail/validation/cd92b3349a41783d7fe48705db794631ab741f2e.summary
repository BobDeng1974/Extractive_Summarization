@entity0 found a glimmer of hope in @entity4 's dismal start to the @entity6 season when he at least finished sunday 's @entity8 @entity7			1
the @entity9 was last of the 11 cars that completed the race , and was twice lapped by race winner @entity13 's mercedes , but the 2009 world champion saw some positives			2
' today has been a good day , ' he said			0
' we 're still a long way off , but this is a good starting point -- and i enjoyed the race			0
i even had a good little battle with @entity21 ( @entity22 )			0
@entity4 driver @entity0 finished last at the season - opening @entity8 @entity7 @entity0 waves to the crowd ahead of the race			1
@entity4 have endured a difficult start to the season ' today also really helps in terms of development			1
if we 'd done three laps , we 'd have learned nothing , so we 've learned a massive amount by completing a race distance			2
' @entity0 missed out on a championship point but he said that was almost irrelevant after a weekend when everything went wrong for the sport 's second most successful team , who have not won a race since 2012			1
' it was also a good opportunity for me to get used to the car and to play around with it , making adjustments in the cockpit , ' said the @entity9 , whose longest stint before @entity49 had been 12 laps			2
' there 's a lot of work still needed - on power , driveability , downforce and set - up - but we can make big strides			0
and , by improving one area , it tends to snowball			0
' @entity4 had low expectations after @entity0 and @entity62 were the slowest qualifiers			1
things only got worse on sunday when the @entity65 failed to make the grid after his @entity68 power unit blew up on the way to the grid			0
@entity62 is presented to the crowd before the race , but the @entity65 failed to make the start after his @entity68 engine blew on the way to the grid ' even though i could n't make the start , the team can learn something from my car 's problem , ' said @entity62 , who was recalled after @entity82 was ruled out on medical advice following a crash in testing			1
' we can take positives from @entity0 finishing the race , too - we came here to learn , and that 's what we did			1
finishing is a small victory for the team - i do n't think we expected to be able to do that			1
" now we can get a car to the finish line , we can start to accelerate our learning			0
' racing director @entity97 also found a silver lining from a dark weekend			0
' it 's not easy to find positives , but in fact there are some , ' he said			0
' we can take positives from @entity0 finishing the race , too -- we came here to learn , and that 's what we did			2

@entity0 finished 11th at season - opening @entity8 @entity7
