a mysterious dark energy could be swallowing up the universe to leave a ' big , empty , boring ' place			1
researchers from the @entity4 and @entity6 clam to have found indications that dark matter , the cosmic scaffolding on which the universe is built , is being slowly erased by dark energy			1
they claim the latest astronomical data favours a dark energy that grows as it interacts with dark matter , and this appears to be stunting the growth of structure in the cosmos			1

researchers from the @entity4 and @entity6 clam to have found indications that dark matter , the cosmic scaffolding on which the universe is built , is being slowly erased by dark energy ( artist 's impression pictured ) ' this study is about the fundamental properties of space - time , ' said professor @entity32 , director of @entity34 's @entity33			1
' on a cosmic scale , this is about our universe and its fate			0
' ' if the dark energy is growing and dark matter is evaporating we will end up with a big , empty , boring universe with almost nothing in it			1
dark matter provides a framework for structures to grow in the universe			2
meanwhile , dark energy is a mysterious substance that is thought to be pushing the universe apart			1
' the galaxies we see are built on that scaffolding and what we are seeing here , in these findings , suggests that dark matter is evaporating , slowing that growth of structure			1
' scientists claim the latest astronomical data favours a dark energy that grows as it interacts with dark matter , and appears to be stunting the growth of structure in the cosmos			1
pictured is a @entity70 composite image of evidence for a dark matter ring in galaxy cluster @entity74 +17 dark energy can be observed in models that show how the universe expands			1
but no one knows exactly what it is			0
one explanation for dark energy is that it is a property of space			2
another suggests that dark energy comes from the quantum theory of matter			2
in this theory , ' empty space ' is full of temporary particles that continually form and then disappear			0
scientists believe roughly 68 per cent of the @entity92 is dark energy and dark matter makes up about 27 per cent			1
the rest - everything on @entity96 and all normal matter - adds up to less than five per cent of the universe			0
dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe , and is invisible because it does not reflect light			2
it can not be seen directly with telescopes , but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see			0
the @entity111 says : ' shine a torch in a completely dark room , and you will see only what the torch illuminates			0
' that does not mean that the room around you does not exist			0
scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe , but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it			0
professor @entity32 said cosmology underwent a paradigm shift in 1998 when researchers announced that the rate at which the universe was expanding was accelerating			1
the idea of a constant dark energy throughout space - time - or the ' cosmological constant ' - became the standard model of cosmology			2
but researchers at the universities of @entity34 and @entity141 believe they have found a better description , including energy transfer between dark energy and dark matter			1
he said : ' since the late 1990s astronomers have been convinced that something is causing the expansion of our universe to accelerate			0
the simplest explanation was that empty space - the vacuum - had an energy density that was a cosmological constant			0
' however there is growing evidence that this simple model can not explain the full range of astronomical data researchers now have access to			0
' in particular the growth of cosmic structure , galaxies and clusters of galaxies seems to be slower than expected			2
' professor @entity167 , of the @entity168 , said : ' the paper does look very interesting			0
' any time there is a new development in the dark energy sector we need to take notice since so little is understood about it			2
' i would not say , however , that i am surprised at the results , that they come out different than in the simplest model with no interactions			0
' we 've known for some months now that there is some problem in all data fitting perfectly to the standard simplest model			0
