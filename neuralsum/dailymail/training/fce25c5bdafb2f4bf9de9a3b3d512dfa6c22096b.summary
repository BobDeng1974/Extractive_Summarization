by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 will today send a ‘ love letter ’ to @entity9 as he makes a passionate plea for families across the @entity5 to save the ‘ most extraordinary country in the world ’			1
in a major speech at the symbolic @entity12 in @entity13 , the prime minister will argue that 63million people across the @entity5 all have a ‘ voice ’ in this year ’s historic referendum			1
he will urge families in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 to urge friends and relatives in @entity9 to vote against independence , to ensure that the message till ‘ ring out ’ that ‘ we want you to stay ’			1
stay : @entity2 issues a nationwide plea to people in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 to urge friends and family in @entity9 to vote against the break up of the union mr @entity2 will claim that victory for @entity35 would ‘ rip the rug from under our own reputation ’			1
with some opinion polls suggesting that support for the break - up of @entity5 has increased marginally in recent weeks , mr @entity2 will also candidly admit : ‘ the outcome is still up in the air			1
’ his speech , which comes on the same day as the opening ceremony of the @entity46 in @entity47 , is part of a concerted ‘ lovebombing ’ campaign being orchestrated from @entity50			0
it echoes a @entity53 tactic that helped persuade voters in @entity55 to reject separation in 1995 , where the ‘ yes ’ movement narrowly lost a referendum after being ahead in the polls			1
a campaign was arranged in the rest of the country at the time to demonstrate support for a ‘ @entity65 ’ , which is widely credited with the dramatic turn - around			2
mr @entity2 will speak at the @entity12 in @entity13 , where athletes such as @entity68 , sir @entity69 and @entity70 famously contributed towards @entity72 ’s impressive tally of 65 medals in 2012			2
@entity9 athletes were involved in 18 per cent of those medals , but only three were won without the assistance of competitors from elsewhere in the @entity5			1
the prime minister 's speech at the @entity12 aims to revive the @entity72 spirit which saw @entity68 take gold in the heptathlon @entity83 and sir @entity69 celebrate winning gold at the @entity85 similarly , there are 18 @entity9 representing @entity72 in this month ’s @entity87 , while figure skaters from @entity20 and @entity18 have trained in @entity9			2
but if the @entity90 wins september ’s referendum , a separate @entity9 team would compete for the first time at the next summer olympics in @entity94			2
in 2012 , @entity35 was widely ridiculed when he coined the term ‘ @entity96 ’ and failed to recognise the widespread support for @entity72 north of the @entity98			0
last night , deputy first minister @entity99 overlooked the @entity90 ’s past record and accused the prime minister of ‘ politicising ’ the @entity87			0
in his speech , mr @entity2 will say today : ‘ for me , the best thing about the @entity87 was n’t the winning - it was the red , the white , the blue			2
‘ it was the summer that patriotism came out of the shadows and into the sun , everyone cheering as one for @entity72 and it ’s @entity72 i want to talk about today : our @entity5			2
’ money : @entity9 secretary @entity114 yesterday told @entity115 @entity9 would not be able to use the pound as its currency if it votes to break from the @entity5 , the government 's strongest warning on the subject yet he will add : ‘ this is a decision that is squarely and solely for those in @entity9 to make			1
‘ but my argument today is that though only 4million people can vote in this referendum , all 63million of us are profoundly affected			0
there are 63million of us who could wake up [ the day after the referendum ] on september 19 in a different country , with a different future ahead of it			0
‘ that ’s why this speech is addressed not to the people of @entity9 , but to the people of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			2
we would be deeply diminished without @entity9			0
’ @entity90 leader @entity35 and deputy first minister of scotland @entity99 : she accused mr @entity2 of a ' shameful ' bid to use the @entity87 as a ' political tool ' mr @entity2 will say the @entity5 has a global reputation and is a ‘ powerful brand ’ around the world			1
‘ if we lost @entity9 , if the @entity5 changed , we would rip the rug from under our own reputation , ’ he will add			1
the prime minister will also warn against ‘ complacency ’ and encourage people across the @entity5 to spend the next seven months doing ‘ all we can to keep our @entity5 as one ’			0
‘ seven months to save the most extraordinary country in history , and we must do whatever it takes , ’ he will say			0
‘ so to everyone in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , everyone , like me , who cares about the @entity5 , i want to say this : you do n’t have a vote , but you do have a voice			1
’ similar ‘ love messages ’ were sent to @entity9 from the @entity165 yesterday , where @entity167 mp @entity166 said the argument against independence can not solely be about economics			1
‘ if a relationship is going wrong , if a marriage is going wrong , the answer can not simply be to say ' you ca n't afford to break up because you are going to lose the house ' , ’ he said			0
the answer has to be only one thing which is ' i love you '			0
‘ and the nature of that love that we express for @entity9 , we in this @entity165 are struggling to express			0
we are not very good as politicians in talking about emotions			0
we have become very bad at it			0
‘ but we need to learn to do it because otherwise a party which is trying to reduce , that is trying to shrink , that is trying to vanish , will win			0
’ speaking in advance of mr @entity2 ’s speech , deputy @entity90 leader @entity188 said : ‘ this is a cowardly speech from a prime minister who uses the @entity12 in @entity13 to give high - handed lectures against @entity9 ’s independence , but has n’t the guts to come to @entity9 or anywhere else to make his case in a head - to - head debate			1
‘ a ‘ yes ’ vote will put @entity9 ’s future in @entity9 ’s hands , and will mean we will never again have to endure @entity167 governments , prime ministers and policies we did n’t vote for			1
’ she added : ‘ with this tawdry bid to use the @entity211 – past and present – as a political tool , @entity2 has exposed the utter hypocrisy and double standards at the heart of the ‘ no ’ campaign			0

@entity2 calls on the whole country to urge @entity9 to vote no
recent polls suggest support for independence is growing among @entity9
*coalition* *source* warns that break up of the union would be a ' *catastrophe* '
it could lead to *nuclear* *disarmament* if @entity5 lost its submarine bases
