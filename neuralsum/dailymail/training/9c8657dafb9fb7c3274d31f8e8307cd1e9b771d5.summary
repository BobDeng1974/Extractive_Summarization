by @entity0 published : 16:21 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 21:07 est , 18 may 2013 calling for reform : chief constable @entity2 suspects are being ‘ left dangling ’ on police bail for too long , according to one of @entity7 ’s most senior police officers			1
@entity2 , chief constable of the @entity9 , has joined calls for limits on the length of time people are left on bail before they are charged or released			1
the move follows a spate of high - profile cases in which suspects have had their lives disrupted for up to two years during criminal investigations			1
mr @entity2 , the @entity20 ’ spokesman on media issues , told @entity23 that he wanted a review of procedure			1
‘ i do n’t think anyone can be happy with very long bail			1
‘ in the past police have released people without bail and that has n’t stopped us continuing the investigation , particularly if they are unlikely to abscond			1
' we have re-arrested them at a later stage when we have had sufficient evidence			2
that way , they are not left dangling			2
’ there is no limit on how long police can keep people on bail			1
sometimes there are stringent conditions attached , such as residing at a particular address and restrictions on movement			2
last night , the civil rights group @entity48 joined calls for a review			1
its director of policy , @entity51 , said : ‘ bail is a vital tool in the police ’s armoury			1
but with no time limit , lives are put on hold and days disrupted by burdensome bail conditions with no end in sight			1
‘ a six - month statutory backstop would encourage swift and efficient investigation – and end the uncertainty and fear of having the threat of prosecution hanging over your head indefinitely			2
’ mr @entity2 said his ‘ gut reaction ’ was that six months would be a suitable time limit			1
in one of the most high - profile cases , @entity72 , the former executive editor of the @entity73 who was arrested on suspicion of phone - hacking in 2011 , said his life was almost destroyed by the experience of being held on police bail for nearly two years , before being told he would not face any charge			1
high profile complaint : @entity72 , former executive editor of the @entity73 , said his life was almost destroyed by being held on police bail for nearly two years his solicitor , @entity83 , said mr @entity72 was one of several clients who had been on bail that lasted more than a year			1
mr @entity83 said the overuse of police bail was indicative of ‘ lazy ’ officers who made arrests before they had properly gathered the evidence			1
he added : ‘ these are not terrorist - type scenarios where you might need to keep people on protracted police bail			1
it ruins people ’s lives and smacks of police inefficiency			1
’ more than 100 people remain on bail in operations linked to phone - hacking and corruption , many for more than a year			1
professor @entity104 , from the @entity105 , who is an expert on the subject , said it had become ‘ an increasingly oppressive , undocumented and unaccountable power by which the police can restrict the liberties of thousands of innocent people every year ’			1
statutory backstop : critics of limitless bail complain that lives are put on hold with no end in sight he added : ‘ the use of police bail powers is in need of urgent reform			1
’ @entity125 , director of the @entity125 , said : ‘ it should concern anyone who believes in the rule of law that tens of thousands of people each year are held , sometimes for months on end , in the @entity131 of police bail			1
at the very least its use should be properly recorded and monitored so the police can be held properly to account			1
’ a @entity138 spokesman said : ‘ we continue to keep police bail provisions under review to ensure they strike the right balance between protecting an individual ’s right to civil liberty and allowing police to carry out thorough criminal investigations			1
’ by @entity149 , former director of public prosecutions concern : @entity151 , former @entity152 , should not conduct arrests in secret secrecy is one of the greatest curses to afflict @entity7 public life			2
it resides in the belief that some people ( those in power ) deserve to have information that others ( the rest of us ) do not			2
apparently , we ’re not to be trusted , or the world is too complicated for us to understand , or important people in power will be too scared to tell the truth to each other if the rest of us might be listening			2
but this travesty of public values has brought us nothing but disguised incompetence , national ignorance and undiscovered sleaze			2
secrecy has afforded few of the benefits that its addicts - in - power claim it will bestow , and the time for the rest of us to put up with being patronised has long since passed			1
sometimes secrets can be important			0
nations are complex and they need protecting in a dangerous world			0
we understand that some things have to be hidden from view , where that is genuinely necessary , to protect the vulnerable or to defend our country in dangerous times			0
some secrets may be necessary for our own good , but a culture that celebrates concealment is not			0
and , increasingly it seems , @entity7 is returning to a late and unlamented past where hiddenness is a way of life			0
naturally we are not alone in our addiction to censorship			0
indeed the level of public information available in some @entity207 countries makes @entity7 look like a beacon of free speech and democracy			0
@entity211 , in particular , is notoriously furtive and closed , and it has been that way for 60 or more years			0
the opacity of the institutions of the @entity215 , and the unaccountability of its bureaucrats and its powerless parliament , are a disgrace that breeds no confidence in the laws and regulations that rain down upon us from across the @entity223			0
it is precisely this lack of transparency , this strange unknowability , which leads so many people in this country to distrust , even to despise an @entity215 whose birth and purpose were and should remain so noble			0
why , they think , should we pledge allegiance to a super-nation that wo n’t share ? and this is the problem with secrecy : it is tight - fisted			0
it allows no scrutiny , no accountability and , in the end , no justice or fairness – because justice , fairness and secrecy can not co-exist			0
they are always in conflict			0
this is why a deficit in transparency , the sense that things are hidden from the public gaze , brings a collapse in public confidence			0
people , rightly , do n’t trust what is n’t explained and they do n’t believe in things that hide away			0
why should they ? you might think that the @entity7 police , above all , would understand this – particularly in a society where , traditionally , they have worked by consent rather than by brute force , and taken care to keep the peace alongside citizens rather than in ugly confrontation against them			1
but disappointingly , they do n’t seem to get it			0
it is , of course , true that the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) does n’t really represent the police			1
instead , it is an unaccountable club of senior policemen who have tended over the years to serve their own interests			0
but even so , their recent announcement that , when officers make arrests in the future , the identity of their prisoners will be kept secret from the public , is deeply shocking			0
this new policy is , it seems , a poorly judged over-reaction to perceived media and police excesses in the past and , in particular , to the strictures of the @entity297 , which focused on the very worst media misconduct in recent years			2
there are better means of protecting the public from press misconduct than by imposing a suffocating blanket of concealment – and many ways less damaging to the wider public interest			0
so if @entity20 believes the answer to a multitude of problems in criminal justice is more secrecy , they ’re asking the wrong question			0
it seems unlikely that many members of the public believe that policing suffers from an excess of transparency			0
if there is a problem in the way that the police serve the public , most @entity7 would probably say the solution is more , rather than less light			2
for @entity20 not to see this is a bad mistake			0
arresting someone is a serious business – a famous judge once described it as the beginning of imprisonment			0
in a free society , empowering men in uniform to restrain otherwise free citizens , to remove them from their homes , to put them in closed and locked cells – these are significant inroads into liberty , conducted solely at the discretion of the police			2
this serious exercise of state power should not be conducted in secret			0
the @entity346 , which advises the government on law reform , believes that there should be a general presumption that the identities of arrested people should be revealed , subject only to necessary exceptions to protect particularly vulnerable people or the progress of particularly sensitive police enquiries			2
so far the reaction of the government to @entity20 ’s foolish proposal has been singularly unimpressive			0
perhaps @entity360 and @entity361 might like to suggest to senior officers that , instead of treating the public like children from whom everything must be kept hidden , they should show a little more trust in the people of the country they are sworn to serve .			0
