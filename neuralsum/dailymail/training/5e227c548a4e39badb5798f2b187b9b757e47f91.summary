a significant anniversary is approaching in @entity2 ’s career but there will be no cause for celebration			1
for @entity7 ’s under 21 head coach , october 20 , 2009 is never too far from his thoughts			1
it was the date he was sacked by @entity11 and a glance at the calendar is a reminder of how swiftly and brutally someone ’s life in football can be turned upside down			1
@entity2 remembers that night with clarity			1
it started with @entity11 moving to a point off the top of the @entity22 with a slick 2 - 0 win over @entity24 but began unravelling when he walked into the boardroom and saw the look on @entity29 ’s face			2
@entity7 's under 21 manager @entity2 says leaving @entity11 helped his career take off how @entity7 's @entity33 team could line - up on tuesday yet as he revisits the episode during @entity7 ’s preparations for the second leg of their @entity22 play - off with @entity39 , there is no bitterness or anger			1
while it may have been one of the worst things to happen to him , he knows the best came out of it			0
‘ look , no question : losing your job is something that will affect anyone ’s confidence , ’ said @entity2 , whose side will defend a 2 - 1 lead on tuesday night			1
‘ anyone who has been through that — no matter what you earn or what you have achieved in your life — it is a blow to the ego			2
‘ but in hindsight , it gave me the chance to learn and strengthen myself in areas of coaching where i needed more knowledge : management , leadership			1
it is different from leadership on the field as you are leading an organisation when you manage a club			0
you are hardened by the experience			0
‘ i think i am a coach who has empathy with his players but i ’m less worried whether they are upset and disappointed , as i ’ve seen the impact of relegation on a club — having to make staff redundant and make decisions that affected the livelihood of good friends			0
that toughens you up quite a bit			0
’ at first , it was difficult to adjust			0
he confesses to ‘ getting under my wife ’s feet ’ and trying to find solace at his local gym , where he found himself becoming a regular at coffee mornings with the local pensioners			0
he expressed an interest in some jobs in the @entity22 , only for no interviews to be forthcoming			0
it was then @entity2 realised the only way he would get back into the game was with education			2
soon enough , doors started to open			0
@entity2 lets out a roar as @entity11 manager when they equalised against @entity109 in may 2009 @entity2 on being sacked : ' it gave me the chance to learn and strengthen myself in areas of coaching ' @entity2 admits it was difficult to adjust but is glad he managed to get back on his feet with @entity7 's @entity117 ‘ i worked with @entity118 , which got me access to some great matches and back involved studying football , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ then i got the call from sir @entity124 to come and work here , three - and - a - half years ago , which gave me a real insight into youth development in this country			2
‘ i think he knew i want the best for @entity132 football and wanted to maintain the standards that he had			0
‘ i see a lot of my mates out of work or losing their jobs and it ’s a reminder that if you are doing something you believe in and it ’s something that you really enjoy , that is a lucky place to be			0
’ @entity2 got a call from sir @entity124 to work for @entity7 's @entity33 squad three - and - a - half years ago he is 13 months into a three - year contract as under 21 head coach and it is clear @entity2 has had an influence			1
the way @entity7 came back in @entity148 against @entity39 on friday night was proof his methods are working			1
@entity7 ’s novices kept playing and pressing , never panicking			2
they approached the task in the same calm way as the man who has taken them to the brink of @entity156			2
it is why he will offer perspective if they ultimately fall short			0
‘ i ’d just like the players and staff to progress , ’ he said			0
‘ i think when you have been through what i have as an individual , first of all in 1996 , then again with losing the job at @entity11 — having had to manage in the @entity168 with no experience at 35 — you can cope with anything			1
@entity2 's @entity33 team take on @entity39 away and take a 2 - 1 advantage from their first leg @entity156 qualifying clash			1

@entity2 was sacked by @entity11 on october 20 , 2009
‘ it gave me the chance to learn and strengthen myself in areas of coaching where i needed more knowledge : management , leadership , ' says @entity2
