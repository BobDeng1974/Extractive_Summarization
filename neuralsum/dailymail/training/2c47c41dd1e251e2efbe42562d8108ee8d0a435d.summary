former referee and @entity2 columnist @entity0 believes refereeing is at the worst level he can remember refereeing chiefs have hit back at criticism sparked by @entity2 columnist @entity0 by publishing statistics that claim standards have never been higher			0
despite a number of horrendous mistakes which blighted @entity12 matches over the @entity14 period , @entity9 tried to make a case that 95 per cent of major decisions are correct			1
last week @entity0 highlighted several game - changing gaffes and called for referees ’ chief @entity20 to be sacked			1
poll was supported by former @entity9 head @entity22 , who branded the current officials the ‘ worst we have ever seen ’ and named four top - flight referees he thought should be axed referees ' chief @entity20 ( pictured ) tried to hide officials ’ poor performances behind statistics @entity22 watches a game at @entity31 ( left ) and during his days as a top - flight referee ( right ) on a day when @entity34 manager @entity33 was charged by the @entity35 for comments made after @entity37 was wrongly shown a yellow card for diving against @entity40 , the @entity9 tried to hide their officials ’ poor performances behind statistics			1
and in a bid to undermine their critics , @entity9 argued standards had improved since @entity22 left five years ago			1
as well as showing referees ’ fitness has got better , the figures claimed accuracy on major decisions was up to 95 per cent from 94.1 per cent , penalty - box calls were 98 per cent right and offsides had increased in accuracy to 99 per cent compared to 92 per cent when @entity20 took charge in @entity57 managers , players and fans will find it hard to believe these figures			1
@entity62 , pictured with @entity64 's @entity63 , is one of four officials @entity22 wants stood down @entity66 discusses a decision with @entity69 boss @entity68 at @entity70 's @entity66 awarding @entity80 their first penalty in the 2 - 2 draw at @entity75 , when @entity77 ’s cross struck @entity78 in the face , left @entity81 manager @entity71 dumbfounded and calling for the use of video replays			1
also on @entity86 , @entity85 boss @entity84 said officials should suffer for bad performances following the 1 - 1 draw at @entity91 keeper @entity90 somehow escaped dismissal despite clearly handling the ball outside his area , while @entity95 was sent off for his reaction to @entity98 ’s late tackle			2
@entity99 was the official once more and @entity85 ’s @entity95 had his red card rescinded			0
@entity102 and @entity103 had red card decisions overturned in december , after confusing calls by @entity105 and @entity106 respectively			2
in light of this , @entity0 said standards had ‘ sunk to their worst level that i can remember ’ and @entity22 cited ‘ over 20 major errors ’ during the @entity14 period			1
he called for @entity66 , @entity105 , @entity62 , and @entity115 to be stood down			0
@entity0 added last night : ‘ these stats will provide little succour for the millions who have watched games scarred by poor decisions			0
it ’s typical of @entity20 , an accountant by profession , to hide behind statistics			2
people would think more of him if he came out from behind his statistical smokescreen and faced his critics			0
i believe these stats to be flawed as they do n’t record non-decisions			0
for example , @entity90 ’s handball wo n’t be included as the referee played on instead of giving a free - kick			0
@entity105 , pictured booking @entity81 's @entity133 , has also come in for criticism from @entity22 referee @entity115 shows @entity85 goalkeeper @entity135 a red card against @entity137 in december @entity22 wants @entity138 ( centre ) to be stood down if he fails to pass a fitness tes			0

@entity20 claimed that 95 per cent of major decisions are correct
@entity9 ( @entity9 ) also said penalty - box calls were 98 per cent right and offside calls 99 per cent correct
former @entity9 head @entity22 had branded current officials the ' worst we have ever seen '
