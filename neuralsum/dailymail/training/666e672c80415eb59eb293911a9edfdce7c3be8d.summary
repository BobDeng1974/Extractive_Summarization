jailing her for 18 months today , he said : ' there is not a single word of regret or thought for the children who were at the wrong end of your activities			0
it is all inward looking			0
' there was no mental illness here			0
you were never mentally ill. ' your entirely self - centred approach to this has blighted the careers of everyone you taught			0
' the mother of four , from @entity59 in @entity17 , said she had advanced qualifications in sciences from universities in @entity63 and @entity64 , where she was raised before moving to @entity66			1
she used those qualifications , supported by fake certificates , to obtain her first teaching job , at @entity70 in @entity71 in 2004			1
but by 2007 , she was already having her first brush with police when it transpired she had lied about the extent of her academic background			0
@entity2 was cautioned for the offence but had already taken on a role as an examiner with @entity18 , marking @entity80 papers in biology			1
it was off the back of this position that she was given a one - year teaching contract at @entity86 in @entity87 in 2011 , where she was to lead a-level students through their biology modules			2

' this is a case which represents a pattern of behaviour of this lady lying			0
' even as she was caught out ( in 2007 ) , she was continuing to lie and create false supporting documents to obtain jobs			0
' this was a carefully constructed sham of a life			1
' defending , @entity129 said @entity2 was ' a pathological liar ' , but said she was undergoing a psycho - therapeutic intervention programme , at her own personal expense			2

mr @entity129 said : ' she lied in order to create a life for herself , in order to create social standing as a teacher			2

' he said it was ' ironic ' that the intellectual @entity2 could well have become a good teacher , had she gone about it in the correct way , with the correct qualifications			1
