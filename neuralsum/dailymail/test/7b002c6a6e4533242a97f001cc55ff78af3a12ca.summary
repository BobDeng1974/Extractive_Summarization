he said our brain never sees the real world , but instead infers it based on the ' sparse ' data it receives and used a series of optical illusions to make this point			0
for example , he explained that humans only have three colour sensors , we ca n’t see infrared or ultraviolet and we have a blind spot in each eye			0
‘ our visual data is actually astonishingly sparse and even if we were able to accurately record and process every photon that reaches our eyes , we ’d still have too little data to be able to reconstruct the world accurately , ' he said			0
he used the recent black and blue / white and gold dress as an example			0
‘ our visual system takes its best guess and sends that to the conscious mind , ’ he continued			0

we are inference machines , not objective observers			0
he then showed a red and blue pill on hands that were shown on a yellow background to give an example of how this inference model breaks down			0
the colours of the pills are the same shade of grey , and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive , based on the rest of the information around them			0
and even when a person knows that the pills are grey , they still see them as red or blue			0
‘ your visual system is n’t interested in whether the photons coming from a tile on a random image are red or blue or grey , ' mr @entity191 continued			0
' knowing that did n’t keep anyone from being eaten by lions on the @entity289			0
what it is interested in is identifying potentially relevant features , in the real world , under a variety of conditions			0
