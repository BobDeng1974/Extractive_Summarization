he added : ' the costs seem very large '			0
although it currently stands at £ 19million , the bill could be reduced at a later hearing if @entity15 can not sufficiently explain why its lawyers cost more than double mr @entity8 's			1

you have to do a cost versus benefits analysis - if you go to court and go for the jugular , you might win but you have to consider what it will cost '			0
the couple met at @entity17 in the 1970s when ms @entity12 was studying chemical engineering and dr @entity8 was obtaining a doctorate in mathematics			1
