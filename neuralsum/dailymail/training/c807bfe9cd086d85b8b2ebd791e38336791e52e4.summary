by @entity0 published : 08:26 est , 20 october 2012 updated : 11:25 est , 20 october 2012 a senior journalist who was part of the original @entity3 expose into @entity5 child - abuse allegations warned the @entity7 director general not to cover - up why the report was dropped			1
the leaked email suggests @entity7 chief @entity10 ignored a pressing plea from investigative reporter @entity12 , about his ‘ misleading statements ’ regarding the content of the cancelled programme			1
he declined to speak to ms @entity12 about the matter despite her urgent email sent 12 days ago but has since spoken to senior @entity7 management about her version of events			1
@entity5 has been described as one of the most prolific child sex abusers of all time more than 200 people have come forward to say they were abused by the tv star in the email to the director general , seen by @entity29 , she said : ‘ worst of all has been what seems like a concerted effort to make it appear that our story was about something else , something that could be dropped and forgotten ahead of fulsome tribute programmes			2
' it is this which seems to be fuelling the damaging claims of a cover - up			1
’ the damaging leaked email comes ahead of a @entity43 investigation into @entity5 , due to air on monday , which is expected to look into why the @entity7 dropped its original @entity3 report on the tv star last year			1
but mr @entity10 has refused to be interviewed for the programme - citing legal advice that he should restrict his statements to the police , official inquiries and a commons committee hearing on tuesday			1
@entity54 are now demanding that every @entity7 email linked to the decision by @entity3 to drop an investigation into @entity5 ’s abuse of teenage girls should be made public			1
correspondence leading all the way to the top of the corporation should be disclosed in a bid to retain public trust , they insisted			0
it follows the emergence of a leaked e-mail which appears to cast more doubt on the @entity7 ’s stated reason on why the current affairs show dropped the programme			1
@entity3 reporter @entity12 , right , emailed former @entity3 editor and new director genereal @entity10 warning him about cover - up surrounding the cancelled programme the memo suggests @entity3 journalists had been ‘ focusing on allegations of abuse ’ rather than , as has been claimed was the case by the @entity7 , on the allegation of a failure by police to look into the case properly			1
the email from a press officer shows that , by december 7 last year , the @entity7 was at an advanced enough stage to be readying ‘ lines to take ’ when questioned about the planned broadcast			1
it reveals that the @entity7 was conscious that it would create difficult questions about why the corporation had not investigated the star when he was alive			2
in the email , the press officer admits that ‘ we may well need to do a bit of managing around this ’			0
there were also growing calls last night for the @entity7 ’s director of news @entity100 to appear in front of mps to give her version of events			2
while much of the attention has focused on mr @entity10 and what he knew , insiders have pointed out that the prime focus should instead be on @entity110			2
@entity5 pictured during a visit at @entity112 , where a number of former patients have come forward to complain of sexual abuse the former dj and tv presenter was said to have selected his victims before inviting them backstage where he abused them unlike mr @entity10 , she is said to have known the outline of what was in the @entity3 investigation			2
@entity54 are questioning why she had not used her knowledge of the allegations to get the @entity7 to pull the @entity128 tribute programmes last @entity129			1
last night @entity54 called for all relevant emails to be published			0
this could include any messages sent between @entity3 editor @entity133 , deputy director of news @entity134 and @entity110			0
@entity137 mp @entity136 , who received the leaked email from a @entity7 insider , has been tirelessly campaigning to get to the bottom of the @entity3 case			1
he said : ‘ i think at some point certainly all the internal evidence that is collected should be published as part of any report in the same way a select committee would do that			0
’ @entity54 have called for the @entity7 's director of news @entity100 , pictured , to answer questions from the select committee conservative mp , @entity153 , who chairs the culture , media and sport select committee , said in order to ‘ restore credibility ’ all ‘ relevant evidence ’ , such as emails , should be made public			1
but he added this should be done as part of @entity165 ’s @entity7 independent inquiry into @entity3			0
another select committee member @entity137 mp , @entity166 , said : ‘ i think the @entity7 may well have to [ publish the emails ] because i think they are in a very serious situation			0
‘ again it comes back to the point that this is their phone - hacking moment and it will get to a stage where people will want to see what the evidence is to make up their own mind			0
’ mps also said miss @entity100 may in the coming weeks have to appear in front the culture , media and sport select committee which is quizzing mr @entity10 about the @entity128 scandal on tuesday			2
mr @entity136 said : ‘ there are questions whichever way you look at it			0
' if @entity10 ’s version of events is correct then it means @entity100 knew that there were issues to do with the transmission of the @entity193 tribute programmes because she knew that there was a @entity5 investigation going on			0
’ he said presuming she had known about the content he questioned why she had not thought it ‘ completely inappropriate ’ to let the @entity128 tribute shows go out			0
the mp added : ‘ i have already written to @entity153 suggesting that he may wish to call both @entity201 , @entity3 reporters and @entity100 before him			0
’ mr @entity153 has said his committee would ‘ reserve the right ’ to call other people in if there were still questions to be answered			0
a @entity7 spokesman said of the press office email : ‘ this ridiculous story in no way casts doubt on what the @entity7 has previously said on this			2
it is simply an exchange between a junior press officer and the @entity3 producer asking for further information about the @entity5 investigation			0

senior reporter @entity12 warned @entity7 chief @entity10 about a cover - up at the @entity7
he has refused to appear on a @entity43 programme due to air on monday , expected to probe why the original *documentary* was dropped
@entity54 have demanded full disclosure of all email *shared* between senior @entity7 staff over scandal
