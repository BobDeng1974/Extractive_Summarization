@entity0 , the @entity1 secretary , has spent more than a full year of his five - year tenure on overseas travel , racking up more than 930,000 miles on trips that cost the taxpayer more than $ 4.7 million			1
mr @entity0 , the former governor of @entity6 , has taken at least 40 trips outside the @entity8 as of july 2014 , meeting officials and visiting sailors and @entity11 in more than 100 countries — travel he said is critical to his job in furthering @entity8 and @entity1 interests abroad			1
the inspector general investigated after receiving a complaint about his travel and cleared him of any wrongdoing , mr @entity0 said			1
keen traveller : @entity0 listens as @entity21 of the @entity1 explains how a computer adjusts biofuel consumption while aboard the @entity24 off the coast of @entity26 , @entity27 , in july 2012 , his 373 days on the road contrast however with those of army secretary @entity30 , who took fewer than half the trips at less than half the cost over the same time period			1
according to data obtained and compiled by @entity36 , @entity0 ' flights cost $ 4.6 million for fuel , maintenance and crew			1

mr @entity0 ' entourage includes a security officer , military assistant , policy advisers and a public affairs officer — about seven people in all			2
their per diem travel costs would approximate @entity0 ' and could add as much as $ 700,000 to the total costs of the travel			1
mr @entity30 travels with up to 10 staff , so the per diem expenses could total more than $ 300,000			2
the travel costs come amid deep budget cuts across the @entity64 , including widespread efforts to slash headquarters spending , downsize the @entity45 and @entity11 , and cut back on acquisition programs , training and other costs			1
those cuts , said @entity71 , senior fellow at the @entity72 , make it ' even more important that senior leaders scrutinize their travel and make sure that the travel they 're doing is essential			2
' mr @entity0 is so proud of his travel he even has a mileage ticker on his @entity1 website , showing he has traveled 932,129 miles as of this week			1
of the 325,000 sailors and nearly 190,000 @entity11 , as many as 100,000 are serving in nearly 100 countries around the world			0
and , he said , negotiating issues such as basing ships in @entity85 , @entity86 , is more effective face to face			0

you could send them a note , ' he said			0
' i do n't think they take it nearly as seriously if you 're not sitting across the table from them			0
' he noted that a female sailor on a stop in @entity27 complained to him that she felt she had no future as a nuclear officer because women could n't serve on nuclear submarines			0
that conversation , said mr @entity0 , led to his finalizing plans to allow women to serve on the subs			2
' i think the return on investment for my travel has been phenomenal , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' in terms of the progress we 've made with countries like @entity118 , @entity86 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 — in terms of advancing @entity8 's interests , in terms of advancing @entity1 interests , in terms of the work that we do together and the benefits that come from that — i think the return on investment has been huge			1
' this picture of the @entity1 website shows a mileage counter , right , of navy secretary @entity0 travels secretary @entity30 oversees an @entity45 of more than 508,000 active - duty soldiers , including more than 130,000 in over 150 countries			1
he said he tries to go where large concentrations of soldiers are as well as countries where there are national security issues			0
' i think a lot about the balance between the responsibilities of being here and the requirement to get out , ' mr @entity30 said			2
' if someone were to ask me , have you traveled too little or too much — i 'd say too little			0
i do n't think you can ever be briefed in the @entity148 in a way that provides you an accurate perspective the way you can just seeing it on the ground for 10 minutes			0
' in may , @entity30 stopped in @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 after a company of soldiers participated in military exercises last spring			2

he 's also traveled to @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 — including a snowmobile safari on the tiny island of @entity192			0
the @entity193 has become a key national security issue , as melting ice caps are opening up sea lanes and spurring competition for oil and gas deposits			0
the @entity1 is developing plans to increase communications , harden ships and negotiate international agreements so nations can better track traffic in the @entity193			0
mr @entity0 ' most frequent destination — 12 stops — was @entity170 , where thousands of @entity11 have served			2
but @entity86 is also a favorite with nine visits , including five times between may 2013 and june 2014			0
he said he was in @entity86 so often because of plans to base four @entity8 naval destroyers there as part of the new anti-missile shield			2
@entity0 was there when the first ship arrived in february , was the @entity8 representative for a funeral there in march , then was back again in june			1
