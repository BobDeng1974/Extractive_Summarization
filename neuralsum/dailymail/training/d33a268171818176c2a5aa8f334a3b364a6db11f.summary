by @entity0 published : 09:24 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 09:47 est , 4 february 2013 boasting top designer labels like @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , this @entity2 's cave of classic bling would sell on @entity10 's high street for £ 10m - if it were real			1
in fact , everything in this picture is fake , having been created in sweat shops in @entity15 by workers earning around 30p an hour			0
today three men were starting jail sentences for their part in what police described as a ' highly profitable criminal venture ' importing and selling fake designer goods			1
all fake : this treasure trove of coveted labels including @entity5 , @entity7 and @entity6 would be worth £ 10m if real @entity27 , 44 , @entity28 , 27 , and @entity29 , 33 , were convicted of conspiracy to defraud at @entity32 's @entity31 after a police operation uncovered their lucrative operation			1
imitation designer goods including watches , boots , handbags and clothes were seized by officers investigating the international crime gang which used two corner shops as a front for its giant counterfeiting racket			1
all were imported from @entity15 to @entity32 before fake designer labels , buckles or buttons were sewn onto them and they were sold on at well below market price , either via two @entity32 corner shops or through the internet			1
doing it this way avoided suspicion when the goods were checked by the @entity55 when they arrived in the @entity10			1
fake @entity6 handbags and watches , @entity59 hair straighteners , ugg boots , @entity61 and @entity62 watches , @entity64 and @entity65 jewellery , @entity67 handbags , and @entity69 clothing were among the counterfeit goods sold by the organisation			2
the scale of the gang 's business was such that the goods police confiscated could have fetched £ 500,000			2
jailed : @entity27 , 44 jailed : @entity28 , 27 jailed : @entity29 , 33 the operation was discovered in november 2011 when surveillance officers acting on a tip - off saw one of the gang pick up a delivery of fake hair straighteners and unload them at the @entity83 , a convenience store			1
police raided the shop and found a laptop which proved the gang 's dealings with @entity15 companies which provided the goods			2
the computer also showed that they had set up legitimate arrangements with unsuspecting courier companies such as @entity96 and @entity97 to arrange deliveries			0
up to £ 30,000 in cash was found , along with more than 350 boxes packed with counterfeit goods			0
desirable labels : @entity32 police found a vast haul containing counterfeit designer goods looks expensive : the gang members added designer touches to goods only after they had been imported one of the mob was stopped by police and found to have three mobile phones , a large amount of cash , @entity8 metal badges and numerous invoices , as well as business cards for clothing businesses in @entity15			1
officers also recovered a box of buttons , labels and name plates for designer brands and when they searched a flat above the shop and they also seized two industrial sized sewing machines			2
the following month police raided another @entity32 convenience store , @entity128 , and found piles of counterfeit branded clothing , footwear , jewellery and watches			0
police in @entity32 still want to speak to @entity135 , left , and @entity136 , right further searches uncovered books containing lists of designer brands with figures next to them , and designer brand brass stamps			0
officers also discovered evidence revealing large amounts of cash were paid to individuals in @entity15 via money transfers			0
@entity150 @entity149 said : ' the cost of counterfeit goods for trademark owners , consumers and the @entity10 economy is huge			1
the @entity156 estimates the criminal gain from counterfeiting in the @entity10 alone is worth £ 1.3bn every year			2
' while it might seem like a victimless crime and that buying a knock - off watch over the @entity162 is harmless , you are actually putting legitimate businesses at risk and as a consequence , putting people 's jobs on the line			0
' today @entity27 , 44 , of @entity169 was sentenced to two years in prison , @entity28 , 27 , of @entity32 was given 12 months , and @entity29 , 33 , also of @entity32 , given three years in prison after all were convicted of conspiracy to defraud			1
@entity173 , 26 , of @entity174 and @entity175 , 30 , of @entity32 , were given community service orders after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud			2
@entity178 , 34 , also of @entity32 , was given a 12 - month prison sentence , suspended for 18 months , after he , too , was convicted of conspiracy to defraud			1
the gang imported goods from @entity15 and then selling them via two shops in @entity32 and the internet two other men - @entity135 and @entity136 who are the brothers of @entity29 - are wanted by police			1
@entity150 @entity187 said : ' counterfeiting on this scale requires serious organisation , established distribution channels and money			0
' judging by the swathes of boxes we seized that were stuffed with fake goods , it is clear this gang had set up a highly profitable criminal venture and were pocketing large sums of cash			0
' however , their arrogance and mistaken belief they could act with impunity eventually cost them dear			0
' we seized so much documentation and evidence that revealed both the scale of this criminal network and the undeniable involvement of those convicted			0
' the evidence was so overwhelming that they must have thought they would never be caught			0
but thanks to our officers their entire network came crashing down around them			0

@entity222 imported cheap goods to @entity10 then sewed on designer labels later
@entity226 , 44 , @entity28 , 27 , and @entity29 , 33 , jailed after being convicted of conspiracy to defraud
three others involved in the lucrative *bootlegging* given lesser sentences
@entity233 still want to talk to two other men who were involved
