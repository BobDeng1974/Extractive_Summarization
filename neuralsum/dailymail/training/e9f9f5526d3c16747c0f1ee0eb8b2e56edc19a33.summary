caesarean sections may have been performed on women with birthing difficulties since ancient times , but the emergency procedure has just been done on a sloth for the first time			1
a female sloth who fell out of a tree in @entity9 underwent the emergency operation after suffering seizures and vets captured the moment her baby was born was on camera			1
the injured animal was able to snuggle with her baby who is shown swaddled in a blanket and exploring his surroundings , soon after birth			0
here , the baby snuggles up to his mother the pregnant brown - throated sloth ( @entity33 ) was brought to the @entity34 , after a local hotel worker saw her fall out of a tree , @entity30 reported			1
after trying to help her get back up and climb to safety , he realised something was wrong and called the institute for help			0
the pregnant brown - throated sloth ( @entity33 ) was brought to the @entity34 , after a local hotel worker saw her fall out of a tree			1
here , she undergoes an ultrasound examination despite medication , the mother was struggling to survive and found it hard to move			1
after a few days , she began to have contractions and could feel the baby kicking			0
an ultrasound scan is pictured experts quickly saw the was having ‘ slow ’ seizures and was finding it hard to move her limbs as the result of a knock on the head			0
‘ it was more like a neurotic tick than a typical seizure seen in human and non-human primates , ’ according to a diary entry on the @entity39 ’s website and upon close examination , experts found that while the mother had not fractured her skull , she was heavily pregnant			1
despite medication , the mother was struggling to survive and found it hard to move			1
after a few days , she began to have contractions and could feel the baby kicking			0
making no noticeable recovery , the mother was taken to a vetinary practice and underwent x-rays ( pictured ) which showed that her baby was alive but in a breach position and was on course to be born feet - first a c - section ( pictured ) was performed - thought to be the first time the procedure has been used on a sloth			1
the sloth was anaesthetised and her bladder drained and after 30 minutes , the baby sloth ’s head appeared			2
here , the baby male sloth is shown shortly after birth the brown - throated sloth is a species of three - toed sloth found in @entity95 the forests of @entity97 and @entity98			1
it is the most common of the four species of three - toed sloth			1
both males and females measure between 17 and 31 inches ( 42 - 80cm ) long and stand between one to three - and - a - half inches ( 2.5 - 9cm ) tall			0
adults weigh from 5lbs ( 2.3kg ) to 14lbs ( 6.3kg )			0
each foot has three fingers ending in long , curved claws up to three inches ( 8cm ) long			0
the creatures sleep for up to 18 hours a day and are only active for short periods			0
most of their time is spent clinging to high branches and they only venture onto the forest floor to go to the toilet around once every week			2
adults are solitary , apart from during mating season when females emit loud , shrill cries to attract males			0
the noise sounds like they are saying ' ay ay '			0
gestation lasts for at least seven months and baby sloths are born furry and fully - clawed			1
despite this , they cling to their mother 's underside for five months or more			0
‘ i ’ve never seen a sloth have contractions , but these “ painful moments ” where her entire body seemed to be cramping and her arms reached out for anything to squeeze … really seemed like contractions to me ! ’ @entity140 , wrote			0
experts at the @entity39 grew concerned that the birth was not drawing closer , despite the mother ’s discomfort and took her to a vet in the town of @entity147			0
there , the three - toed animal underwent x-rays and an ultrasound to confirm that her baby was alive but in a breach position and was on course to be born feet - first			1
another obstacle to a natural birth became clear , because the mother had a full bladder which was blocking her baby ’s safe passage and making it unlikely that it might be able to turn around in the womb			2
sloths only pass waste once a week and consequently can store a lot - up to one third of their body weight			2
‘ we determined it was an emergency , and that the only chance we had to save either or both of them was to do a c - section , ’ said ms @entity170			1
the sloth was anaesthetised and her bladder drained and after 30 minutes , the baby sloth ’s head appeared			2
the male infant seemed to be losing body heat fast , but after it was placed against ms @entity170 ’s chest for skin - to - skin contact , the animal warmed up and was quickly swaddled in a blanket , where he seemed alert and curious about his new surroundings			2
the male infant ( pictured left ) seemed to be losing body heat fast , but after it was placed against ms @entity170 ’s chest for skin - to - skin contact ( right ) the animal warmed up and was quickly swaddled in a blanet having warmed up , the animal was quickly swaddled in a blanket ( pictured ) , where he seemed alert and curious about his new surroundings			2
he was later re-united with his injured mother despite the pioneering sloth surgery , the story has a sad ending			2
vets discovered that baby sloth had a heart murmur as well as difficulties breathing and feeding			1
sadly , he died a week after being born			1
and his mother gave up her fight for life a day afterwards , having suffered neurological problems since her fall			2
ms @entity170 said : ‘ it was devastating but not entirely surprising			0
’ she said she is glad the mother and baby got to spend quality time with each other and were seen snuggling up soon after the birth			0
‘ i 'm glad he had a week , and that he had some snuggles with his mum			0
i was at least able to unite mother and baby before they died , so it might not have been a very long life but at least it was a life , ’ she said			1
despite appearing healthy at birth ( pictured ) the little sloth was found to have a heart murmur as well as difficulties breathing and feeding			1
he died at one week old and his mother died soon afterwards			1
ms @entity170 says that despite the ' devastating ' outcome , the operation gave both animals the best chance of survival and she is pleased they got to spend quality time with each other			0
