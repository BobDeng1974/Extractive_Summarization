mrs @entity5 told the @entity12 inquiry into media standards that the prime minister stopped using the acronym after she told him it actually meant ‘ laugh out loud ’ in the text - speak more commonly used by teenagers			1

‘ mr @entity2 always made it very clear that it was a quasi-judicial decision , it was n’t [ for ] him , it was off his remit , ’ she added			2
@entity5 she would be hypocritical to complain about intrusion into her personal relationships , but a lot of the criticism and gossip she experienced was ' gender - based '			2

' as to my own situation , well , it 's been a difficult year , but a lot of the questions that i have had from mr @entity253 ( @entity182 , counsel to the inquiry ) , i felt concentrated on quite a trivial side			0

" she told the inquiry the @entity174 were " just like any normal family , they have dynamics and they change '			0

i reported both to @entity0 and @entity272 and i would talk to them both about the issues unfolding at @entity228			0
' @entity0 and i had offices next door to each other			0
