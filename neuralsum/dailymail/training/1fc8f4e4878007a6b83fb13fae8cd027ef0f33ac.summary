eco-home : @entity8 and @entity9 have been forced to tear down their five metre by six metre cabin in @entity18 , @entity19 , because it was built without planning permission small - holding : the couple tried to live with their children self - sufficiently on the three - quarters of an acre plot they were given a 12 - month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 1,500 towards council costs at @entity36			1
mr @entity37 said he has now demolished the property and would be moving to @entity39 to live and work			1
he said : ' we have spent monday through to wednesday night taking down our cabin with the help of my family			2
it felt such a shame to take it down but we really had no choice			0

this was despite repeated warnings that they did not have the correct planning consent			0

self - sufficient : @entity9 , 32 , washes clothes in a bucket of water on their small holding in @entity18 , @entity19 ' planning policies advise that housing should be situated within settlements and that isolated homes in the countryside will require special justification , such as an essential need for a rural worker to live at their place of work which , in this instance , was not the case			2
