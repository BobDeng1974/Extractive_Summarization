people who only consume organic products could be suffering from ' chemophobia ' and missing out on nutrients found in modern foods do you only eat organic food and think microwave meals are ' toxic ' ? if so , you could be suffering from chemophobia - an ' irrational ' fear of chemicals - and missing out on nutrients found in modern food			1
@entity13 researchers have warned that instead of avoiding pesticides and dioxins , people should be more concerned about natural bacteria , fungi and pathogens			1
they found millions of people are scared of eating unnatural substances , but low doses of natural and synthetic chemicals used in meals pose no risk to people 's health			1
the report , by @entity29 in the @entity13 which is published in the journal @entity30 , argues that low doses of chemicals in modern meals are ' typically harmless and highly beneficial			1
' it also says that the word ' chemical ' has unfairly negative connotations			0
study author and chemistry professor @entity37 , said : ' most people do n't know they are routinely exposed to a host of compounds in non-toxic concentrations in what they eat and drink each day			0
' even the air they breathe â€“ whether in big cities or the countryside -- is full of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals , including wine ' aroma , ' flower ' bouquet , ' perfume ' fragrance , ' bakery ' smell ' and the ' stench ' of rubbish bins			0
' however , he said the chemicals are not inhaled in a large enough quantities to affect humans ' health			0
many of the same compounds found in pesticides are made naturally by plants , animals and humans ' for their own defensive purposes , ' according to professor @entity37			0
the report , by @entity29 in the @entity13 argues low doses of chemicals in modern meals are ' typically harmless and highly beneficial			1
' it also says the word ' chemical ' has unfairly negative connotations professor @entity37 cited the example of halogen compounds , which many people - even many scientists - assume are all uniquely man - made poisons found in dioxins , polychlorinated biphenyls ( @entity84 ) and the pesticide @entity79			1
but he said thousands of halogen compounds are part of our natural environment made by plants , animals and even humans for their own defensive purposes			0
some species even use organohalogens , which contain carbon along with chlorine , bromine , iodine or fluorine , to mount chemical offensives against encroaching competitors			0
while the report says that some beneficial chemicals are found in modern food , it does not suggest swapping fresh vegetables for microwave meals but instead eating a varied diet to avoid exposure to harmful concentrations of chemicals he said : ' food regulators should focus not on pesticides , antibiotics and dioxins but on pathogens , bacteria and fungi , which each year cause millions of cases of food - borne infections in the @entity13 that result in hospitalisation or death			1
' professor @entity37 recommends that people eat ' a diverse diet to minimise their exposure to harmful concentrations of chemicals			2
' he said food is peppered with natural compounds such as organohalogens , dioxins , aflatoxins and many others			2
' food is chemistry beyond our immediate control , including those synthetic chemicals that are deemed to be artificial and should not be found in ' safe ' food			2
' the word ' chemical ' became a dirty word despite the fact that everything we see , smell and touch is chemical			0

@entity13 scientists said some people suffer from an irrational fear of chemicals when low doses used in meals pose no risk to human health
researchers from @entity29 warned people to be more *mindful* of natural bacteria , fungi and pathogens than avoiding pesticides and dioxins
they recommend eating a varied diet , including modern food , to minimise exposure to harmful concentrations of natural and man - made chemicals
