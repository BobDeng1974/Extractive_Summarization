judge @entity155 later told her : ' i do not , for a second , accept your explanation '			0
speaking in mitigation for @entity1 , @entity160 urged the judge not to jail his client as that would prevent her from receiving help in addressing her alcohol problem			1
he also said that while the four - hour period was frightening for @entity169 , it should be seen in the context of alcoholism after years of appropriate care			0
' there is a difference between a deterioration and turning to alcohol after 18 years worth of glowing , appropriate care for someone in a difficult situation , ' he said			2
