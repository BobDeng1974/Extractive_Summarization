the royal baby is n't expected to arrive for another three weeks according to the officially announced due date			1
but sources have suggested there could be a little boy or girl in the royal nursery much earlier than anticipated			0
the @entity7 reported today that ' the @entity8 may be due earlier than the july 13 date announced by @entity9 but have kept the true date a secret , much like princess @entity12			1
' their little secret ? could the @entity15 and @entity8 have announced a different due date for their first baby ? following her lead : princess @entity12 misled the press about her real due date when she had prince @entity21 back in 1982 , princess @entity12 fooled the press by announcing the heir to the throne was due on july 1			1
but prince @entity21 was actually born ten days earlier on june 21			1
if @entity8 and @entity21 have decided to follow his mother 's lead , the true expected due date of their first child will be july 3			1
with the intense press speculation and public interest surrounding the birth , the couple could n't be blamed for maintaining a shred of privacy by misleading the nation on the official due date			1
especially after they lost the opportunity to keep @entity8 's pregnancy under wraps until she reached the three month mark after she was admitted to hospital last november with severe morning sickness			0
of course , the due date is only ever an estimation of when a baby will arrive and as palace sources have confirmed the @entity8 will not be having an caesarian , nobody will be able to predict when her labour will begin naturally			1
@entity8 's last official public engagement was the @entity53 on 15 june			0
ready to put her feet up : @entity8 's last official public engagement was the @entity53 where prince @entity54 made her laugh on the palace balcony missed nuptials : prince @entity21 attended a wedding in @entity59 at the weekend with his brother while pregnant @entity8 stayed at home @entity62 , 31 , is well - aware her son or daughter could arrive even earlier than expected and so missed the wedding of her friends @entity67 and @entity68 at @entity69 in @entity59 at the weekend			1
prince @entity21 , 31 , attended the nuptials with his brother @entity54 , 28 , while @entity8 forwent the trip to the @entity73 to instead be nearer the @entity76 hospital where she will give birth			2
the @entity9 have said she intends to have the baby in the @entity79 at @entity80 's , @entity81 , where @entity12 gave birth to both @entity21 and @entity54			2
they also revealed that @entity84 , the @entity85 ’s former gynaecologist , will deliver the baby , aided by the @entity85 ’s current gynaecologist @entity87 , the former fiance of the murdered @entity89 presenter @entity88			0
as previously reported in the @entity90 , the birth of the @entity15 and @entity8 of @entity93 's first child - a future heir to the throne - will be announced in exactly the same way as prince @entity21 's to retain ' the theatre ' of a genuine royal occasion			1
early announcement : the couple had to go public with their happy news before the pregnancy reached the three month mark after @entity8 was admitted to hospital with severe morning sickness royal repeat : the baby will be delivered on the @entity79 of @entity80 's hospital just as prince @entity21 was theatre of notice : and just as when prince @entity21 was born , a sign announcing the birth will be displayed in the grounds of @entity9 as soon as the baby is born , a proclamation signed by doctors who delivered the boy or girl will be rushed from the ward and displayed at the gates of @entity9 within minutes			2
' we wanted to retain some of the theatre of the notice			0
it is quite important to us that this is done properly and with the degree of dignity that the event demands			0
this is the birth of a child who will be in line to the throne			0
it is a rare occasion and it is nice to be able to do it with some historical precedence , ' a @entity135 spokesman said			0
‘ it is very important [ to us ] that it will not be announced first on @entity143 , although it will be announced on @entity143 in due course			2
’ however , if the baby is born between 10.30pm and 8am , the news will be sent out via press release with the easel being erected later that morning , at around 9am			0
palace sources have also made clear the birth will not be made public until the @entity85 and senior members of the royal family have been informed - and , of course , the @entity154 , in the unlikely scenario that they are not at the hospital .			0

official due date announced as july 13
when princess @entity12 was pregnant she kept true due date secret
prince @entity21 arrived ten days earlier than publicly expected
