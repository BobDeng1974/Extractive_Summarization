infection control : doctors wash their hands less often as they get more tired , meaning there is greater risk of spreading infection , a study warns doctors and nurses wash their hands less often as their shift progresses , increasing the risk they will spread infections among their patients , a study warns			1
the demands placed on medics and carers by long shifts drained their mental reserves and led to them washing their hands less often as their days wore on , researchers found			0
tired and busy staff concentrate on their medical duties and see hand hygiene as a ' low priority '			1
and the more stress and workload , the less compliance with the rules			1
despite strict guidelines to stop bugs spreading , one in 16 people treated in an @entity32 hospital picks up an infection such as @entity34 , according to the latest figures from the @entity36 ( @entity36 )			1
@entity37 , of the @entity38 , said : ' just as the repeated exercise of muscles leads to physical fatigue , repeated use of executive resources produces a decline in an individual 's self - regulatory capacity			0
' demanding jobs have the potential to energise employees , but the pressure may make them focus more on maintaining performance on their primary tasks , for example , patient assessment and medication distribution , particularly when they are fatigued			2
' for hospital caregivers , hand - washing may be viewed as a lower - priority task and thus it appears compliance with hand hygiene guidelines suffers as the workday progresses			1
' mr @entity37 and his team looked at three years of hand - washing data from 4,157 caregivers in 35 @entity68 hospitals			1
in the study published by the @entity71 , nurses accounted for 65 per cent of the sample , nursing assistants 12 per cent , therapists 7 per cent , doctors 4 per cent and the rest other hospital workers			0
it found compliance with handwashing rules dropped by an average of 8.7 per cent during a typical 12 - hour shift			2
however if longer breaks broke up the shift hand - washing protocols were followed more carefully on when staff returned			2
@entity34 : one in 16 @entity32 hospital patients pick up an infection , including this antibiotic resistant bug a previous study in @entity89 has shown hand - washing in hospitals can reduce infections by 3.9 per 1,000 patients			1
another shows the cost per patient with a healthcare - acquired infection is £ 12,966			2
through using this data , the researchers concluded that there would be an additional 600,000 infections per year at a cost of approximately £ 12.5billion annually to @entity68 hospitals alone			0
the human hand harbours more harmful bacteria than public surfaces , a recent study found			0
researchers found the average pair of human hands is more unhygienic than escalators and benches in busy shopping centres and parks			0
yet only one in eight people always wash their hands before eating , the study shows			0
the average person carries more than 10 million bacteria on the hands alone and a @entity123 study found a typical kitchen sponge will contain several million			0
under @entity32 guidelines introduced to all clinical staff , they should clean their hands thoroughly with either soap and water or an alcohol - based handrub , both immediately before and immediately after coming into contact with a patient - even after wearing gloves			1
@entity36 said hand hygiene in @entity32 hospitals has improved in recent years but good practice is still not universal			1
co-researcher dr @entity136 , said : ' we believe ours is the first study investigating whether accumulated work demands can affect rule compliance over the course of a single workday , as opposed to over weeks , months or years			0
' we think this line of research could be applied to other types of workplace compliance , such as ethics standards in banking , safe driving behaviours in trucking and safety standards in manufacturing			0

the more stress and workload , the less compliance with the rules
