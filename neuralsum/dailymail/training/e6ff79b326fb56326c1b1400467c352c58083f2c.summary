@entity0 says @entity1 are ' quietly confident ' of reaching the @entity3 play - offs despite being held to a goalless draw by @entity5 on thursday night			1
the @entity6 were favourites to beat their @entity8 opponents on their competitive continental bow in @entity10 but came away from their third qualifying round first leg with a stalemate			2
@entity14 should have won it for the visitors but saw his 61st - minute penalty saved and somehow flashed a point - blank follow - up against the bar			1
confident : @entity0 remains hopeful that @entity1 will advance to the @entity3 play - offs @entity0 , who was one of @entity21 's most impressive performers in the centre of a back three , was not surprised the visitors did not get things their own way but is banking on a positive result at the @entity28 to carry them through next week			1
experience : @entity0 has been around for a while ' it was a tough game for us , particularly because we 've only had a couple of friendlies and they are into their season , ' he told @entity38			2
' friendlies are n't the same as competitive matches so they were just that bit fitter than us , running round like whippets , which is a bit of a leveller			0
' if it was during the season and we were at peak fitness and match sharp i 'm sure we would have won quite handsomely			0
but we have had the benefit of that game now and i 'm sure we 'll be quietly confident of doing the job at home			0
' @entity14 has missed spot - kicks before , in the @entity55 and @entity3 while at @entity56 , but @entity0 was surprised to see his side 's dead - ball specialist falter from 12 yards			1
' i think everyone in the ground thought it was going in , we all know how cleanly @entity14 strikes the ball , ' he said			2
' the second chance , i think he just thought it was too easy , a rush of blood			0
' i 'm sure he 'll be beating himself up about it but we 'd prefer him to do it in a game like last night when we 've got another chance at home			2
' we 've missed a few penalties as a side so i 'm going to start taking them , but then we really would be in trouble			0
' @entity1 handed debuts to summer signings @entity75 and @entity77 in the second half against @entity5 , and @entity0 expects to see plenty more of them as his father @entity80 shuffles the pack this season			1
improvement : @entity0 produced some sterling performances for @entity1 last season he added : ' we could have a lot of games this year so it 's important to have a big squad and utilise that for each game			1
' the new lads did have a bit of impact when they came on and we need to keep it fresh			0
' i 'd be very , very surprised if we see the same team again for the next match			0

@entity0 remains hopeful that @entity1 will reach the @entity3 play - offs after 0 - 0 draw in @entity101
@entity14 missed a penalty against @entity5 on thursday night
the @entity6 are still in a strong position ahead of next week 's *decisive* leg
