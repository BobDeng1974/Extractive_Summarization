the execution of the only woman on @entity3 's death row , @entity1 , was delayed because the lethal injection was ' cloudy ' the execution of the only woman on @entity3 's death row has been postponed at the last minute for the second time in less than a week - because the drug used in the lethal injection she was scheduled to receive was ' cloudy '			1
@entity8 , 46 , was due to be given an injection of pentobarbital at a @entity12 prison at 7pm on monday in retribution for plotting the murder of her husband in 1997			1
but after officials observed the drug had a ' cloudy ' appearance , they postponed her death until a future , unspecified date ' out of caution ' , according to reports			1
earlier on monday , @entity1 had feasted on a massive last meal of two @entity27 , two large portions of fries , cornbread , a fatty salad , popcorn and cherry - vanilla ice cream			1
it is the second time @entity1 has been spared death from lethal injection			1
on february 25 , officials postponed her execution as a winter storm was due to hit the area			2
it was unclear whether she received her whopping , 3.400 - calorie last meal at that time			1
monday 's decision came as the @entity46 @entity45 considered whether or not to grant @entity1 a stay of execution after a last - ditch appeal for clemency was denied by state officials			1
on monday night , a @entity53 spokesman told the @entity54 : ' prior to the execution the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency			0
' the drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits			0
within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution , the execution team performed the necessary checks			0
at that time , the drugs appeared cloudy			0
' @entity66 immediately consulted with a pharmacist , and in an abundance of caution , inmate @entity1 â€™s execution has been postponed			2
' more than 100 protesters were gathered outside the prison where @entity1 was to be executed , pleading with officials to spare the mother - of - three 's life			1
riot police were also reportedly stationed outside the facility			1
riot police are also outside the prison ' @entity1 is loved ' : death penalty opponents gathered on the steps of @entity3 's @entity85 in @entity86 on monday evening praying : @entity87 , senior minister at @entity88 , prays silently during a vigil for @entity1 , who made headlines across the world with her 3,400 - calorie last meal request murder : @entity1 ( pictured , left , in her arrest mugshot from 1997 ) is due to be executed for plotting the murder of her husband , @entity97			1
however , her boyfriend @entity98 ( right ) who carried out the deed , will be eligible for parole in eight years after accepting a life sentence and testifying against @entity1 in trial @entity1 , who made headlines globally with her 3,400 - calorie last meal request , would have become the first female to be executed in @entity3 in 70 years if the injection had gone ahead			1
her attorneys had recently launched a final attempt to persuade the state 's board of pardons and @entity111 to commute her death sentence to life without parole			2
they were backed by a petition , which had gained over 70,000 signatures by monday evening , saying @entity1 has turned her life around , even earning a theology degree behind bars			1
nearly 400 clergy members , who signed the petition , had highlighted @entity1 's acceptance of ' full responsibility ' for her crime , as well as her graduation from the program for incarcerated women at the @entity127 at @entity128 , through which she became a teacher			2
however , on monday afternoon , the board announced it was standing by its february 25 decision to deny clemency to @entity1 , whose last meal included a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing			1
it said it had voted to abide by its earlier decision after ' careful consideration ' of her case			0
the @entity45 was still deciding whether to grant a stay of execution on monday night			0
@entity1 had been denied clemency at a hearing last week , but her lawyers had argued that extra witnesses from within the prison system could help persuade the board to change their minds			2
previous attempts have rested on the inmate 's remorse and new - found faith			0
in a statement ten years ago , @entity1 herself said : ' i deserve to be here , but i do n't deserve to die			2
' she has also drawn attention to the fact that , while she did not kill her husband , the man who struck the fatal blows is not facing the death penalty - and will , in fact , be eligible for parole in eight years			1
indeed , although her boyfriend , @entity98 , stabbed her husband , @entity97 , at her urging , he could be freed in just eight years after accepting a life sentence and testifying against her			1
@entity1 's death via lethal injection was previously scheduled to take place last week			1
however , it was canceled after a ' rare ' storm caused disruption in the area , closing schools and businesses			0
monster meal : @entity1 ( pictured , above , eating a regular prison meal ) requested an enormous spread for her last meal , including two cheeseburger meals , two large orders of fries , cornbread , popcorn and ice cream locked away : @entity1 ( pictured in 2004 ) has been locked up for the past 17 years after her conviction if executed , she would have become the first woman executed in @entity3 since 1945 and only the 16th put to death nationwide since the @entity45 allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976			1
in their motion , @entity1 's lawyers noted that the parole board had already heard from many people testifying about her faith and remorse at a hearing last week before denying her clemency			2
but , her lawyers argued , the board did not hear from many @entity53 employees whose perspective ' would have left no doubt that a grant of clemency is supported in this case			0
' the most important witness the board did not hear from is @entity208 , who served as her warden for six years , first at @entity210 and then at @entity211			0
@entity208 could testify that former parole board chair @entity212 promised @entity1 would receive clemency , her lawyers wrote			2
each time the topic came up in conversations between @entity212 and @entity208 , ' @entity212 reiterated his statement that ms. @entity1 did not need to worry about clemency as it was a foregone conclusion , ' they wrote			2
@entity1 's lawyers also urged the parole board to subpoena some other corrections employees so they can testify without fear of retaliation			0
although department rules allow employees to speak to lawyers for capital clemency proceedings , the reality is less clear , @entity1 's lawyers wrote			0
some employees had said they would testify and provide written statements on her behalf , but changed their minds after getting a memo from the new warden , who succeeded @entity208 last year			0
petition : @entity1 's attorneys were backed by a petition , which had gained more than 70,000 signatures by this evening , saying @entity1 has turned her life around , even earning a theology degree behind bars ' under no circumstances are you to discuss this with people outside the institution			2
staff should also be careful what is said to other inmates and personal feelings are to be suppressed , ' @entity246 wrote on january 29 as she notified staff of the likelihood of the upcoming execution			0
@entity1 's lawyers also urged the board to consider that before trial , she had been offered the same plea deal as @entity98 - life in prison with an agreement not to seek parole for 25 years			1
' at one time , therefore , all the parties involved in the case thought a sentence less than death was appropriate for ms. @entity1 , ' her lawyers wrote			2
@entity98 , who is the one who stabbed @entity265 to death , took the deal and testified for the prosecution			0
@entity1 balked at the parole agreement and took her lawyer 's advice to go to trial			0
the parole board has granted clemency before in cases involving disproportionate sentences for co-defendants , her lawyers wrote			0
' in fact , this board has on at least four occasions in the past commuted a death sentence of a co-defendant who was not the actual killer of the victim , ' the lawyers wrote			0
@entity265 's parents and sisters wanted her to be executed , but two of @entity1 and @entity97 ' three children asked the parole board to spare her life , the lawyers wrote			1
in statements submitted with their mother 's clemency application , @entity294 and @entity295 described a journey from bitterness and anger to forgiveness			0
' we also believe that @entity1 's death will not restore them or make them whole , ' @entity1 's lawyers wrote of the entire @entity1 family			2
saying a prayer : on monday evening , a @entity308 user named @entity309 wrote : ' praying for # @entity310 , may she find the love and mercy our broken systems could not find for her			1
# kellyonmymind ' angry : @entity314 questioned reports of police in riot gear being dispatched to the prison in @entity12 the petition for @entity1 's clemency , which was launched by @entity321 , described the inmate as a ' powerful voice for good ' who has ' lived a life of purpose ' since her incarceration			1
' while incarcerated , she has been a pastoral presence to many , teaching , preaching and living a life of purpose , " the document stated			0
' @entity1 is a living testament to the possibility of change and the power of hope			0
she is an extraordinary example of the rehabilitation that the corrections system aims to produce			0
' it urged members of the public : ' do not let this travesty of justice happen on your watch			0
' on monday evening , the hashtag # @entity348 was going viral on social media .			1
