by @entity1 reporter they are best known for singing about combine harvesters and cider			2
now the @entity5 have been inspired by a more recent feature of rural life – wind turbines			0
and with a lyric that runs : ‘ they ’re noisy , they ’re ugly and no one wants them here ’ , the so - called @entity15 and @entity16 group have made it clear just what they think of them			1
the @entity20 , the band ’s first single in three years , was written after developers revealed proposals for a 220ft turbine close to the @entity5 ’ base in @entity27 , @entity28			1

you ’ll see them from @entity84 and @entity85 ?			0

' however imposing these cost inefficient turbines on communities after they have been opposed by local parishes and refused by planners seems very unfair and undemocratic			0
