by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 there was plenty of the green , green grass of home that @entity6 crave on the @entity8 ’s pitch on tuesday but whether it will lead to a livelier second @entity9 when battle commences on thursday remains to be seen			1
rarely have 22 yards of turf led to such debate but three moribund surfaces in three tests this summer , including at the home of cricket when @entity17 visited last month , meant all eyes were on groundsman @entity20 ’s creation on tuesday			1
those eyes included those of @entity24 ’s head of pitches @entity26 , who spent an hour taking samples from the surface in company with long - serving @entity20 and @entity32 chief executive @entity31 as the search for pace and bounce goes on			1
on the surface there appeared plenty of moisture — and the pitch stayed covered for most of the day to retain it — but appearances can be deceptive and @entity67 for one remained sceptical about any long overdue signs of life			1
‘ looks a little more like @entity73 conditions , ’ said former @entity6 captain @entity70 on @entity71 about a very green looking square			1
‘ it looked like that two days before the @entity75 , ’ replied @entity67			1
‘ the key is thursday			1
’ @entity6 would be wise to be cynical			2
the extra grass at the start of the first test against @entity17 here encouraged @entity80 to put @entity6 into bat but he then watched them rack up the small matter of 575 for nine			1
easy pickings : @entity85 scored an unbeaten 200 against @entity17 at @entity41 in june @entity86 : @entity85 celebrates scoring his century against @entity17 on a batting friendly lord 's surface @entity36 says @entity6 are confident conditions got easier and easier for batting as the @entity9 went on , a familiar tale this season , and the famously independent @entity20 , @entity32 ’s longest serving employee , is not one to bend to the demands of a frustrated home side			1
it was left to @entity97 , @entity32 ’s head of cricket , to insist that @entity8 ’s are doing their all to try to provide both a better surface and better entertainment for another packed house over the next five days			1
‘ we are just trying to produce the best possible pitch we can , ’ said the former @entity104 and @entity6 opener			1
‘ it ’s not an exact science but we are doing our best to make one with carry and bounce			0
we are going through our normal processes			0
’ the usually personable @entity20 , who has been preparing @entity8 ’s pitches for 30 years , was reluctant to say anything on tuesday about what might happen here , with @entity79 groundsmen suddenly becoming the unwelcome centre of attention			2
taking a break : @entity119 relaxes during @entity121 's nets session at @entity41 on tuesday praying for more : @entity122 will be hoping for a better pitch at @entity41 close control : @entity122 shows off his football skills during training on tuesday @entity6 are privately livid about conditions that have played into the hands of opponents at a time when they simply can not catch a break and @entity121 could not believe their luck when they saw what had been prepared at @entity135			1
this is a huge match for @entity6 , without a win in nine long tests , and a captain in @entity38 who can not afford the consequences that a combination of defeat here and his 26th failure in succession to hit a test century might bring			2
little more than half the @entity6 team were at @entity41 on tuesday , with a schedule that sees five tests in six weeks forcing @entity49 to tell @entity67 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 to put their feet up			1
prior would usually have a long wicketkeeping session with @entity155 two days out from a test but his absence was confirmation that his body is starting to betray him and he needs to prove both fitness and form here			2
recalled : @entity161 is back in the @entity6 team after a disappointing debut during the ashes back in the swing : @entity161 took part in @entity6 training at @entity41 on tuesday talking tactics : @entity161 ( right ) has a word with @entity6 assistant coach @entity170 one man who was at @entity41 was spinner @entity161 , who continued his rehabilitation after the horrors of his @entity79 at the @entity174 last summer with a long bowl that did little to suggest he is ready to return on thursday			1
the inclusion of @entity161 in @entity6 ’s 14 - man squad is confirmation that he remains next in line in the x factor - like search for a spinner but it would be both a surprise and a major gamble if @entity38 and @entity49 threw him in now			0
@entity161 had a difficult day bowling for @entity187 against @entity188 at @entity189 on monday and his bowling this season has been some way short of the levels that led to his shock call - up for the last @entity195 in the first place			0
if @entity6 really did want to pick him at @entity41 they would have to either drop a seamer — and that would lead to even more work for @entity150 and @entity67 — or @entity201 , a move that would not make sense after the @entity205 all - rounder ’s startlingly good century at @entity206 which almost saved @entity6			1
bowling options : @entity201 and @entity208 ( right ) took part in training on tuesday the presence of @entity212 off - spinner @entity213 in the nets was proof that @entity161 is not the only slow bowling option available to @entity6 but they would be best advised to persevere with the under - used @entity218 ’s off - breaks for now			2
the farcical end to the first test on a farce of a pitch at @entity135 at least appeared to give @entity6 another part - time spinning option in the form of @entity226 , who delivered a more than acceptable over of leg - spin			1
‘ i was quite nervous before i bowled because i was n’t expecting it , ’ said @entity226 , @entity6 ’s second highest runscorer this summer behind @entity85			0
‘ i was just glad the first one landed and after that i had a bit of confidence			0
i might get a few more overs in the nets now and we ’ll see how we go from there			0
’ where @entity6 need to go from here is to a victory that would end their worst winless run for more than 20 years but whether the pitch will help them achieve that remains the most sensitive of subjects for everyone involved			2
groundsmen in @entity6 have become the unwelcome centre of attention this summer after producing three lifeless tracks on the spin ( pardon the pun )			0
but what ’s the difference between a raging turner and a featherbed ? @entity257 explains all … @entity258 , @entity259 traditionally in @entity6 , groundsmen produce green wickets , i.e. they have a good covering of grass			2
grassy pitches lead to more movement off the seam for the faster bowlers			0
the grass helps @entity269 because deliveries lose very little pace when they hit the deck , as the slick grass lubricates the surface and reduces friction			2
the ball deviates more readily because the seam bites into the grass while the rest of the ball slides through with little resistance			0
on an ideal test wicket , any hint of green should then be burned away by the sun as a match progresses , bringing spinners into play			1
but this summer , because of a combination of excellent drainage ( sucking moisture out of pitches ) and groundsmen being encouraged to prepare flat tracks that hardly deteriorate to fill county coffers , @entity6 ’s speedsters have been given back - breaking surfaces to bowl on which are slow and low , with batsmen ’s edges often failing to carry to the slips			0
@entity302 wickets in @entity121 , @entity304 and @entity17 are often prepared without a blade of grass on them			0
flat strips of turf which bake under a hot sun are known as ' featherbeds '			0
these are paradise for batsmen to bat on , but they should eventually deteriorate which brings the bowlers into play			0
the footmarks created by pacemen bring spinners into the game , while the cracks that appear lead to uneven bounce which benefits quick and slow bowlers			0
a pitch which spins heavily is often referred to as a “ @entity328 ” , as in @entity329 = raging turner			2
@entity331 and bounce pitches in @entity334 and @entity335 are also hard and true but they are nothing like the dead pitches from @entity338			0
the strips at grounds like the @entity341 ( @entity342 ) and the @entity343 ( @entity344 ) have plenty of pace and bounce because of an even covering of grass , a different soil type and a complete absence of moisture			0
this has @entity352 licking their lips , and would be much palatable for @entity355 than the dead tracks which have been served up this summer .			0
