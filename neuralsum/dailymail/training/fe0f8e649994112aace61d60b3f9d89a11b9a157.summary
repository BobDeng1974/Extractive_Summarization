@entity1 countries could stop deploying law enforcement agencies to fight cartels after concluding that the human costs of the ' @entity5 ' is just too high			1
that is just one of the scenarios envisaged in a ' gamechanging ' report on global drugs policy released by the @entity11			1
commissioned at last year 's @entity12 of the @entity13 the report calls for a discussion in decriminalization of drug use and for greater coordination between nations in tackling the scourge			2
game - changer : @entity1 countries could stop deploying law enforcement agencies to fight cartels after concluding that the human costs of the ' @entity5 ' is just too high many in @entity1 feel a new approach is needed to the drug war - and a shift away from hard - line policies - after decades of violence in producer and trafficking nations such as @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
some regional leaders are pressuring the @entity36 for an overhaul of anti-drug policies and have suggested they might be open to legalisation of some narcotics if that helped reduce violence			0
the 200 page review references a number of @entity46 countries would break with the prohibition line and decide that they will no longer deploy law enforcement and the army against drug cartels after deeming the human cost of life too high			1
' the report presented by the @entity11 today is a vital piece in the construction of a common way to fight this problem , ' @entity32 president @entity54 said during the presentation			0
battle : earlier this month @entity62 defended his administration 's efforts to stem @entity36 demand for drugs that many regional leaders see as a driving factor in their security issues @entity1 suffers the brunt of consequences of the drug war			1
keeping track of the drug deaths is difficult , as official figures have been issued sporadically but in @entity34 alone , upwards of 70,000 people have died in drug - related violence over the past six years			0
the government stresses that @entity34 's murder rate is still lower than several nations , including @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
drug - related violence has plagued @entity83 , @entity82 , and @entity86 as traffickers have increasingly infiltrated @entity88			0
almost all the cocaine consumed in @entity91 countries is produced in @entity1 , while violence linked to the drug trade kills thousands every year as smugglers fight for control of trafficking routes in @entity88 , @entity32 and @entity34			1
drug consumption is ticking up in nations such as @entity99 and @entity84			0
according to the @entity11 , about 45 percent of cocaine consumers , 50 percent of heroine users and 25 percent of marijuana smokers live in @entity13			2
while many people in @entity88 are also weary of the focus on the drug - fuelled violence , it remains an undeniable part of daily life in many parts of the region			0
@entity112 has fared better than many of its neighbors , but it worries about spillover from nearby countries			0
@entity82 , for example , now has the highest homicide rate in the world , with about 7,200 people murdered last year in the tiny nation of 8 million people , most in drug - related crime			0
almost all the cocaine consumed in @entity91 countries is produced in @entity1 , while violence linked to the drug trade kills thousands every year as smugglers fight for control of trafficking routes in @entity88 , @entity32 and @entity34			1
drug consumption is ticking up in nations such as @entity99 and @entity84			0
according to the @entity11 , about 45 percent of cocaine consumers , 50 percent of heroine users and 25 percent of marijuana smokers live in @entity13			2
the report for the @entity11 , which includes all 35 @entity136 nations , aims to start a debate among @entity1 nations regarding anti-drug policies			1
it also advocates for softer policies toward drug users			1
' the decriminalization of drug consumption must be considered the base of any public health strategies , ' the report says			2
' an addict is not a person with a chronic disease that should be punished for his addiction			0
' the report echoes comments by @entity154 , the head of the @entity155 , who in march said she favored @entity1 governments treating drugs as a public health problem			1
it also calls for ' a substantial reduction in penalties ' to drug addicts and urges countries in the region to opt for rehabilitation programs instead			2
it suggests that countries in the region should consider the option of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana consumption			0
' our report , however , did not find any significant support , in any of the countries , toward the decriminalization or legalization of any other illegal drug , ' the @entity11 said			1
the @entity36 has sent billions of dollars to @entity32 to combat the cocaine trade but still there is limited coordinated effort between countries in fighting drug trafficking and usage			1
that prompted several member presidents to ask the @entity11 to analyze the region 's anti-drug policies in order to make them more effective failing : federal police in a drugs bust in @entity191			2
the @entity192 , a human - rights and pro-democracy group , celebrated the report as a ' game changing ' document that likely will broaden the debate on drug policy reform			1
' this is the beginning of an international conversation on a new approach to drugs , ' said @entity203 , the group 's senior regional advocacy officer			0
' we can hope this will move policies from those currently based in repression to strategies rooted in public health and human rights			0
