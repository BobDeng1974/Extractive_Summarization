speaking at a conference in @entity2 today , sir @entity0 said : ' the system is creaking , it is under pressure at the moment ' accident and emergency services are already under strain from increased winter demand , the medical director of the @entity8 in @entity9 has admitted			1
speaking at a conference in @entity2 , sir @entity0 said : ' the system is creaking , it is under pressure at the moment			1
' a&es are having to address increasing demand , the ambulance services are struggling in many parts of the country and we have a number of issues to deal with , which we are tackling			0
' also speaking at the conference , dr @entity26 , president of the @entity27 , said increased pressure was partly due to ambulances being called by @entity8 operators			1
however sir @entity0 said forward planning meant the @entity8 should cope better with a spike in demand for @entity37 services this winter			1
measures included a flu plan announced in april and a system to help trusts which were struggling to plan for winter , launched in june			0
a £ 400 million injection of funding from the @entity45 in june also helped preparation , he said			0
another £ 300 million boost in october assisted with staffing and bed capacity			0
sir @entity0 said : ' we 've started to address winter much sooner than in any of the other years			1
' in winter we know that the demand on @entity37 changes			1
' so while the activity might be slightly lower than during the summer , the proportion of people who need admission is higher			0
' he said high expectations from the public and budget cutbacks were also making it more difficult for the @entity8 to succeed			2
sir @entity0 defended proposals to overhaul the health system to create ' supercentre ' specialist @entity37 departments			1
the @entity0 review , published last november , advocated the concentrating of accident and emergency services into a few specialist hospitals			2
he said : ' there has been a slow and inadvertent deception that all a&es are equal			0
they are not , and people in the know know that			0
' he also said that demographic changes has placed greater strain on the @entity8 and that younger people had ' an expectation of an immediacy of service '			2
dr @entity26 , president of the @entity27 , speaking at the same conference , said : ' i think the system is under pressure but it 's working pretty well			2
' he said that increased pressure was partly due to ambulances being called by @entity8 111 operators			1
earlier this week it was reported that casualty departments were forced to close their doors to ambulances nearly 100 times last month as they failed to cope with soaring patient numbers , alarming figures show			1
in total , around 27,000 patients were stuck inside the backs of ambulances outside @entity37 units for at least half an hour because staff were too busy to take them in – a third more than this time last year			1
and in early december , more than 35,000 patients were forced to wait more than four hours in @entity37 – the worst figure on record – separate statistics reveal			1
experts warned that the ‘ bleak ’ figures were indicative of a ‘ crisis ’ in the @entity8 and showed the system was ‘ cracking under extreme pressure			1
’ and they say the situation could worsen over the next month			0
@entity8 chiefs finally released the data indicating how hospitals are coping with the pressures of winter five weeks later than planned yesterday			2
they show the situation is far worse compared with this time last year			0
waiting times data is normally released on a weekly basis from the start of november			0
but @entity9 said that it was being held back while they ‘ reviewed ’ the information – prompting concerns they were trying to delay bad news			0
last week , more than 35,000 patients had to wait more than four hours in @entity37 – the worst figure on record the 95 occasions that overstretched casualty units had to divert ambulances to other hospitals is almost double the 48 in the same period last year			1
a total of 6,968 operations had to be cancelled – 367 which were urgent – and 33 patients waited on trolleys in corridors for more than 12 hours			0
several hospital trusts are now on ‘ black alert ’ – whereby gps are urged not to send in patients – and senior @entity8 managers in some areas of the country have admitted the situation is the worst in living memory			2
the figures show @entity37 units are already under considerable pressure even though winter is barely under way			1
the crisis is partly due to bed - blocking , where elderly patients stay in hospital despite being fit for discharge because of a lack of care for them at home			0
in addition , record numbers of patients are visiting @entity37 because they are unable to get an appointment with their gp			2
separate weekly data shows that 35,373 patients waited more than four hours in @entity37 – the government ’s target – a record number since data was first published in november 2010			1
dr @entity181 , chair of the @entity183 ’s council which represents senior doctors , said : ‘ these figures point to a system cracking under extreme pressure , leading to unacceptable delays in care			1
‘ while the @entity8 is used to seeing a spike in demand during winter months , this year it ’s experienced a spring , summer and autumn crisis as well , leaving no spare capacity in hospitals as we hit winter			1
’ last month the government announced that @entity37 units would get an extra £ 700million to avert a winter crisis , a sum that senior doctors described as little more than a ‘ sticking plaster ’			2
dame @entity202 , @entity9 ’s national director of commissioning operations blamed the crisis on soaring numbers arriving in @entity37 and having to be admitted on to hospital wards			0
there were 436,229 attendances last week – up nearly 30,000 on the average typically seen for this time of year			0
dr @entity210 , chief executive and general secretary of the @entity213 , said : ‘ last year ’s winter pressures on hospitals and @entity37 never went away – our health service is now running at capacity all year round , and a bad winter could spell disaster			0
‘ staff are working incredibly hard to care for record numbers of patients , but the system is failing both staff and patients			0
’ shadow health secretary @entity227 said the figures should be a ‘ wake - up call ’ .			0

sir @entity0 said today : ' the system is creaking , it is under pressure '
other organisations blame ambulances being called by @entity8 operators
sir @entity0 added @entity8 should be able to cope with a surge in demand
but figures show @entity244 closed doors to ambulances 100 times last month
last week more than 35,000 had to wait more than four hours in @entity37
