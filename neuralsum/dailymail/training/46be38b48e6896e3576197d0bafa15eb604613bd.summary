ask a football fan who the greatest player in the world right now is , and they will more than likely fire back at you one of two names			0
since 2008 , the official world 's greatest player prizes have been a two - horse race between @entity10 and @entity11			1
but for how long can the duo dominate at the top before a young upstart takes their place ? it could be sooner than you think as a certain @entity18 is already exceeding the game 's dominant duo at international level			2
@entity18 scored twice in @entity23 's 4 - 0 friendly win over @entity24 in @entity25 on wednesday @entity18 skips past a challenge of @entity24 's @entity27 following another impressive performance , with the forward declaring after the match he was in the form of his life with just 59 caps , @entity18 already has 42 goals to his name as he looks to continue his rapid rise the @entity37 forward scored twice in @entity23 's 4 - 0 win in @entity24 on wednesday , taking his international tally to 42 goals in just 59 international games			1
to put that into perspective , @entity10 has just three more goals from 96 @entity46 appearances , while @entity11 's 51 goals have taken him 116 caps			1
@entity49 has also scored 42 international goals - but even he has played 79 times for @entity52			2
@entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 's strike rates at international level are no match for @entity18 's @entity18 ( @entity23 ) : 59 caps , 42 goals @entity11 ( @entity57 ) 116 , 51 @entity10 ( @entity46 ) 96 , 45 @entity49 ( @entity52 ) 79 , 42 @entity58 ( @entity59 ) 104 , 65 @entity60 ( @entity61 ) 99 , 43 while @entity10 is still the undisputed no 1 star at @entity37 , @entity18 looks to already have the measure of his team - mate on the international stage			1
it may have been the @entity66 picking up the @entity67 at this summer 's @entity69 finals , but the 27 - year - old faded in the latter stages of the competition - to the point where his impact on matches was becoming minimal			0
@entity18 however was the stand - out star in a @entity23 team who were in with a good chance of going all the way on home soil			2
the host nation had their weaknesses but with @entity18 in their ranks they were unbeatable ... until he got injured			0
@entity18 poses for a selfie with @entity23 team - mates on the team coach following the win over @entity24 video @entity24 delight for @entity18 and @entity23 ( full match highlights ) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 total : 2 caps 13 caps 12 caps 19 caps 13 caps 59 caps 1 goal 7 goals 9 goals 10 goals 15 goals 42 goals everyone knows what happened next as first @entity105 ( 7 - 1 ) then @entity106 ( 3 - 0 ) ripped in to @entity23 to expose just how much the 22 - year - old was carrying the international team			1
even the players knew it judging by the over-the - top reaction of bringing @entity18 shirts and caps out before the ill - fated annihilation by @entity105 in the @entity69 semi-final			2
just to prove he was n't riding on the crest of a wave , his return from injury for the team has resulted in five consecutive wins for @entity23 - with @entity18 scoring all four goals in a 4 - 0 win in @entity124			1
@entity23 capitulated at the @entity69 after @entity18 injured his back in the quarter - final against @entity127 such was @entity18 's impact on the @entity69 , @entity23 's squad posed with the forward 's shirt on the pitch shortly before being hammered 7 - 1 by @entity105 in the teams ' @entity69 semi-final earlier this summer @entity18 has built on his fine @entity69 form , recently scoring all four goals in a 4 - 0 win over @entity124 it 's transforming to his club game too			1
after a steady first season at @entity37 , the forward now looks ready to kick on and take @entity142 football by storm			0
he 's one goal ahead of @entity10 this term with 12 strikes			0
@entity18 only scored 13 for @entity37 in his first season following his high profile switch from @entity149 , but he now looks ready to hit the next level having settled in @entity142			2
@entity11 's 24 goals makes the @entity153 still top dog in @entity154 , but @entity18 's rapid progression can not be ignored whether it 's in a @entity23 shirt or a @entity37 one			1
following a steady first campaign in @entity142 , @entity18 has kicked on in his second season at @entity37 as he started the year by outscoring @entity10 across all competitions after another fine performance against @entity24 , where he was applauded off by the home fans , the forward admitted he was in the form of his life but also fired out a warning to his rivals and detractors that he will only get better			1
' i think so ! ' said @entity18			0
' i ’m very emotional			0
it ’s another country , another stadium to keep in my heart			0
i did n’t expect this , i could n’t be happier			0
but i always want more			0
i do n’t want to remain at this level			0
' for now the greatest player in the world debate still circles around @entity10 and @entity11 , but the future is coming and it may arrive sooner than you think in the shape of @entity18 if his international form is anything to go by .			1

@entity18 scored twice in @entity23 's 4 - 0 win over @entity24 in @entity25
has international strike rate better than @entity10 and @entity11
@entity37 forward vows only to improve after being in form of his life
