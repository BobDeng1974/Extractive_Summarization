by @entity0 a dominatrix and two friends who were accused of torturing one of her clients at knifepoint have been cleared of all charges			1
the anonymous man was visiting 20 - year - old @entity10 - who he had paid for oral sex twice before - when he claimed he was jumped by her friends @entity13 and @entity14			1
he told a court that he feared his penis would be cut off , during an ordeal in which he was forced to suck miss @entity10 's toes and told his face would be scalded with boiling water			1
cleared : @entity10 , 20 , had been accused along with two friends of torturing a man who had previously paid her for sex at her flat in @entity26 , @entity27 - but today the trio were cleared of all charges but mr @entity13 , 21 , insisted on a different version of events - that an argument had broken out when the client enjoyed an hour - long domination appointment then refused to pay			1
today a jury took less than two hours to clear the trio of false imprisonment , robbery and common assault			1
the trio had already been cleared of blackmail and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent			0
the jury also cleared a fourth man , 22 - year - old @entity46 from @entity26 , of perverting the course of justice after he was claimed he offered the man £ 1,500 to drop his allegations			1
during the trial the jury was told the alleged victim , who can not be named for legal reasons , was held at knifepoint while he was forced to dance around in nothing but women ’s underwear			0
he also claimed he had his face cleaned with a toilet brush - all while being filmed , and was threatened the footage would appear online			0
claims : @entity10 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) said mr @entity13 came to the flat after the man refused to pay speaking from behind a screen , the man said he had visited miss @entity10 's home on july 23 last year in the belief she would have non-domination sex with him for free , after he previously paid £ 50 for oral sex twice			1
he told the jury that when he got to her flat , he was jumped on by two men including one wearing a balaclava and holding a knife			2
' the man said if you do what we tell you then you wo n’t get hurt , ' said the alleged victim			0
' i was kissing her feet for maybe 15 seconds			0
she took a sip of her drink and sprayed it all over me			0
' they were getting a buzz out of the whole thing ... they were laughing all the way through			0
' what happened was real ... i still have to live with it today			0
' the man said he was able to escape when he exaggerated breathing difficulties he was having and one of his alleged captors called 999			0
but miss @entity10 said the alleged victim had come to her flat for a domineering session which he then refused to pay for			1
mr @entity14 , 22 , of no fixed address , said he was only at the flat in case things got violent between @entity101 and the man , which he said they did when he refused to pay			1
missing : miss @entity10 had not attended the four - day trial and a warrant remained in place for her arrest and mr @entity13 , from @entity109 , said he only arrived at the flat after the argument over money began , and he was the one who called 999 when the man began having breathing difficulties			1
in court the alleged victim was accused of making up the story to cover his embarrassment after paramedics found him in the flat wearing just women ’s underwear			2
he denied wanting to engage in a domination session , denied taking part in an hour - long appointment and denied telling miss @entity10 : ' that was * * * * , i ’m not paying			2
' but the jury took just one hour and 40 minutes to clear all four defendants of all charges			0
there were smiles from mr @entity46 and mr @entity13 in the dock and mr @entity13 gave the jury a thumbs - up			1
it came after judge @entity135 dismissed a blackmail charge against @entity101 , mr @entity14 and mr @entity13 , saying there was not enough evidence			2
he also instructed the jury to find the trio not guilty of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent			0
mr @entity14 and miss @entity10 did not appear at the trial , and warrants remained in place for their arrests			2
the pair have not been seen at @entity149 since last year , despite numerous court hearings being held ahead of the four - day trial .			0
