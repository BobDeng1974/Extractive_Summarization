by @entity1 reporter controversial @entity2 - a member of @entity3 - spoke out at an extraordinary meeting last on tuesday evening called to consider whether he should resign a @entity6 councillor who said the floods plaguing @entity8 were caused by the homosexual marriage law , has been expelled from the party after saying gays should repent			1
controversial @entity2 - a member of @entity3 - spoke out at an extraordinary meeting last on tuesday evening called to consider whether he should resign			1
he made national headlines two weeks ago when he wrote a letter to his local newspaper saying that the deluge of floods was caused because of @entity19 ’s successful move to change the law about same - sex marriage			1
at a meeting of the town council on tuesday evening , members voted unanimously to distance themselves from their councillor colleague ’s views			1
bizarrely , mr @entity2 also voted for the motion			2
however , he took the floor at the meeting to refuse to resign and outspokenly called for gay people to seek repentance from @entity32 , adding that he stood by his earlier comments in the @entity34			1
mr @entity2 was suspended and subsequently expelled from @entity6 over his letter to the newspaper in which he warned @entity19 that ' natural disasters ' would follow the passing of the same sex marriage @entity40			1
speaking to a packed town hall chamber , @entity41 said : ' @entity43 was it my intention to insult the gay community and i certainly apologise to them if personal insult has been their perception			2
' he added that his aim had in fact been to criticise the government for passing the @entity40 and ignoring ' the national textbook , the @entity56			0
' ' i have read that i am barmy to connect this to the weather - if that is the case then i am in good company , ' he said , citing senior bishops blaming floods on ' abandonment ' of bible teachings			0
' the @entity65 i serve welcomes all possible types of person , whether straight or gay , ' he said			2
' all they have to do is come to him in repentance and faith			0
' in 2007 , the right reverend @entity72 , @entity73 , argued that the floods that year were a judgment on society ’s moral decadence and the fact that ' every type of lifestyle is now regarded as legitimate			0
' @entity41 said he was exercising his right to free speech by writing to the newspaper , which he claims held back his letter for three weeks and added his political and town council affiliations			2
' i have had endless support from all over the country and the world and have the confidence to stand by every word i wrote , ' he said			2
mr @entity2 wrote another letter to the @entity34 in april 2012 in which he told @entity19 not to legalise gay marriage and warned of ' disasters ' if he did however , he conceded he will be ' more circumspect ' in his views in future and said he intended to serve on the council for his full four - year term			1
several councillors spoke to distance themselves from his views but added that he had served @entity3 - on - @entity103 well , in voluntary roles at @entity106 shops , community groups and on the council			0
councillor @entity108 said : ' i would not support @entity2 ’s resignation as i know he is a good councillor for @entity3 on @entity103			2
however , i feel there is a huge danger in ostracising anyone , whether it is intended that way or not			0
' councillor @entity117 , in distancing herself from his comments , added : ' i am a @entity118 too and i have a sister who is homosexual and i lived through what she went through with homophobic comments , remarks and all sorts			0
@entity124 : part of the letter in the @entity34 , claiming recent floods were godly vengeance ' mostly fear and sometimes hatred comes from things that are not understood and not known about			1
' to say that a section of our community - and whether they choose to get married or not is to blame for this - comes very close in my opinion to crossing the line between expressing an opinion and inciting hatred			0
' in a 20 - minute session for the public to speak , several residents also spoke of the need to protect free speech while others called for mr @entity2 ’s resignation			1
his wife , @entity146 , said they had owned a caravan which up until last year was on a site run by a lesbian couple they ' loved and respected			0
' ' this is nothing to do with individuals , it is all to do with the fact that the word of @entity32 says marriage is for a man and a woman , ' she said			1
@entity160 , who started a petition calling for his resignation which has reached 25,000 signatures , said : ' there is a huge gay community in @entity3 , which he represents to one degree or another , which has been incredibly upset and hurt by his comments			2
' his comments only serve to make life more difficult for young people struggling with their sexuality			0
' @entity175 said : ' everybody has a right to their opinion in this country and it is very dangerous to start saying that is not the case and have people reprimanded for that			0
' @entity186 added : ' if somebody put forward views that were as harmful to an ethnic community as those put forward about the gay community by mr @entity2 , we would n’t be having this discussion here today			1
' however , @entity194 said : ' in the case of @entity19 ’s decision to redefine marriage , i think that it is a shameful and wrong thing to do and takes no account of the constitution of this country			0
i support the councillor in his views			0
' mr @entity2 declined to comment after the meeting .			1

@entity2 , 73 , wrote a letter to the @entity34 in @entity208
in it he said storms were @entity32 *'s* *punishment* for legalising gay marriage
now , he has called on homosexuals to repent at a council meeting
he has now been expelled from @entity6 after his comments in the paper
