by @entity0 and @entity1 pledge : every new smartphone sold in @entity4 will have a ' kill switch ' to prevent it from being used by thieves , phone makers have pledged every new smartphone sold in @entity4 will have a ' kill switch ' to prevent it from being used by thieves , phone makers have pledged			1
the system , which protects users ' personal information and renders phone useless if they are lost or stolen , could become standard by 2015			1
it has been backed by @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 - along with leading mobile device carriers in the @entity4			1
the companies have signed on to a voluntary programme , called ' @entity23 , launched by @entity24 , a trade group for wireless providers			0
in doing so , they have agreed to provide a free preloaded or downloadable anti-theft tool on all smartphones sold in @entity4 after july 2015			2
users ' options will include remotely removing a smartphone 's data and preventing reactivation if a phone is stolen or lost , the trade group said			1
at present , a consumer has to report a stolen smartphone to a carrier and request to have it disabled			2
they also have to either install tracking apps or rely on manufacturers to offer remote - kill features built into their operating systems			2
but with a ' kill switch ' installed , a special text message could be sent to the phone which would render it useless			1
surprisingly , the pledge has been backed by law enforcement and elected officials , who have previously warned that putting a permanent ' kill switch ' on phones has serious risks , such as the potential for hackers to activate it			1
however , they are now encouraging phone markers to implement the system in a bid to combat surging smartphone thefts across @entity4			2
it has been backed by @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 - along with leading cellular carriers in the @entity4 pleased : the companies have signed on to a voluntary programme launched by trade group @entity24			1
ceo @entity73 ( pictured ) said he ' appreciated ' manufacturers ' response to the programme the pledge may place pressure on mobile device manufacturers in other countries - such as @entity81 , where phone theft is also high - to adopt the system			1
in a statement , @entity24 chief executive , @entity73 , said he ' appreciated ' manufacturers ' response to the voluntary programme			0
' we appreciate the commitment made by these companies to protect wireless users in the event their smartphones are lost or stolen , ' he said			1
a ‘ kill switch ’ is a system for remotely disabling smartphones and wiping their data			1
all personal information - such as contacts , photos and emails - will be deleted and the phone rendered useless			1
however , emergency services and pre-programmed emergency numbers will remain accessible under current law			0
once the phone is back in the hands of its rightful owner , its previous settings and data will be restored ‘ to the extent feasible			0
’ the system will become standard in 2015 , according to a pledge backed by most of the mobile world 's major players			1
currently , a consumer has to report a stolen smartphone to a carrier and request to have it disabled			2
they also have to either install tracking apps or rely on manufacturers to offer remote - kill features built into their operating systems			0
with a kill switch installed , a special text message could be sent to the phone which would render it useless			1
some campaigners are calling for preloaded kill switch software on every smartphone rather than leaving it up to individual manufacturers and carriers			1
however , a major concern is that a kill switch would be an attractive target to hackers who could find out the special message and disable a phone remotely			1
this is a particular risk for people who work in defence or law enforcement agencies , say opponents of the plan			0
' this flexibility provides consumers with access to the best features and apps that fit their unique needs while protecting their smartphones and the valuable information they contain			0
' at the same time , it 's important different technologies are available so that a " trap door " is n't created that could be exploited by hackers and criminals			0
' other smartphone makers to have signed the pledge include @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 - as well as cellular carriers @entity170 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 , according to @entity176			1
it comes nearly two weeks after @entity18 announced that it had added two anti-theft features , ' @entity180 ' and ' @entity179 ' to its recently released @entity182 smartphone			2
@entity16 created a similar ' @entity184 ' feature for the popular @entity185 last year and has offered a free tool called ' @entity187 '			2
almost one in three robberies in the @entity4 involve phone theft , according to the @entity190			0
lost and stolen mobile devices - mostly smartphones - cost consumers more than $ 30billion in 2012 , the agency said in a study			1
earlier this month , @entity196 legislators introduced a bill that , if passed , would require mobile devices sold in or shipped to the state be equipped with the anti-theft devices , from next year			0
similar legislation is being considered in @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 , and bills have been introduced in both houses of @entity206			0
@entity208 district attorney , @entity209 , and @entity201 state attorney , general @entity210 , have given manufacturers a june deadline to find solutions to curb smartphone theft			0
they said in a joint statement today @entity24 's plan is ' a welcomed step ' , but still falls short of ending smartphone theft because the measures will rely on consumers to seek out and turn on the technology			0
' this approach is a losing strategy , and that 's why this commitment falls short of what @entity4 wireless consumers need to effectively end the epidemic of smartphone theft , ' added mr @entity209			0
security measures : it comes weeks after @entity18 announced that it had added two anti-theft features to its @entity182 smartphone ( left )			2
@entity16 created a similar anti-theft feature for the popular @entity185 ( right ) last year but @entity236 , a longtime tech analyst in @entity237 , said the wireless industry 's commitment may be the closest to solving the smartphone theft problem			2
he believes leading manufacturers signed on to the programme because they noticed the @entity4 government is in the process of making sweeping changes			0
' i 'm sure there will be a lot of back and forth , but this is the next natural step , ' he said			0
' i do n't think the wireless industry would 've done this if there was n't pressure from lawmakers and the public to come up with some solutions			0
sometimes it takes a nudge			0
