earlier , the court heard that the guilty pleas were accepted on the basis that there was no causal link to the incident			2

' our thoughts and best wishes are with them			0
' our tree management system could and should have been better			2
' @entity134 welcomed the heavy financial penalties on the company			0
a spokesman said : ' these sentences reflect the fact that the park and @entity220 have failed over a number of years to manage the risks posed to the paying pubic and employees			0
' there was a failure to assess and actively manage the tree population to ensure the park was safe			2
