@entity2 ’s very own nocturnal , rabbit - eared @entity1 mascot is under threat with bilby numbers becoming dangerously low			1
the native @entity6 marsupial once occupied more than 70 per cent of the @entity6 mainland while now it ’s disappeared from around 80 per cent of that area with small populations remaining in @entity11 , the @entity12 and @entity2			1
@entity13 , ceo of @entity14 the @entity15 told @entity16 that it ’s very difficult to pin point the exact number of bilbies left in @entity2 because of their ‘ cryptic ’ nocturnal habits			0
’ in recent years the bilby has become an important part of the @entity6 @entity1 tradition however , its ties with our @entity39 community dates back much further with bilbies making their way into dream time stories			1
mr @entity13 said the critters were of ' high significance to traditional land owners ' with record of bilby populations dating back ' 15 million years '			0
until recently , @entity2 had two species of @entity49 - the @entity50 and the @entity51			2
the @entity51 is already believed to be extinct while the @entity50 is classed as ‘ endangered ’ in @entity11 and ‘ vulnerable ’ nationally			2
in recent years the bilby has become an important part of the @entity6 @entity1 tradition however , its ties with our @entity39 community dates back much further with bilbies making their way into dream time stories			1
predators like feral cats and foxes are the biggest threat to the bilby populations while other contributing factors include farm animals destroying bilby habitat and introduced species like rabbits competing with them for food and burrows			1
mr @entity13 said foxes and feral cats are ‘ desimating the population			1
’ the @entity70 said feral cats are the driving force behind the dramatic decline of wildlife across the country with the feral felines killing an estimated 75 million native animals every night			1
' i think people are starting to recognise that these animals are having such a devastating effect on many native animal populations			0
' mr @entity13 said the @entity82 has committed to a @entity83 this year that will focus on creating a plan to address the feral cat issue			0
in the mean time , the @entity14 the @entity15 have developed a captive breeding program and believe that continuing breeding efforts in controlled environments could be they key to saving the endangered marsupial			2
the @entity50 is a nocturnal marsupial with a silky grey and white coat and a long black and white tail			0
bilbies have large ears , a long snouts and a great sense of smell that helps them locate food			0
the bilby is omnivorous and eats bulbs , fruit , seeds , fungi , insects , worms , termintes and even small lizards or spiders			0
they do n’t need regular water because , like koalas , they get most of their water from their food			0
the royal visit : even the royal family , pictured , wanted to drop by to get some face time with the native marsupial			2

@entity49 numbers are dropping with only around *600* left in @entity11
the native marsupial once occupied 70 per cent of the @entity6 mainland
now , they have disappeared from around 80 per cent of that area
introduced predators like feral cats and foxes are their biggest threat
controlled breeding programs are in place to try and save the @entity1 icon
