by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 16:33 est , 6 december 2013 monday will be ' take your parent to work day ' for radio presenter @entity4 as he will be joined by father @entity5 for a special broadcast			1
the father and son are teaming up to help people love mondays after research has revealed a quarter of adults get monday morning blues			2
the pair will present a one - off breakfast radio show that will be streamed live via www.quaker.co.uk from 7am on 9 december			1
but is it ever a good idea to work with family on a live show where tensions could be running high ? early alarm call : @entity5 and @entity4 will be up with the larks to present a breakfast show on monday morning the pair insist there wo n't be any family fall outs despite the early start and fact @entity29 admits he ' can be grumpy in the morning '			1
however the 33 - year - old did confess he has been known to get ' petulant ' with his father in the past			1
he told @entity33 : ' luckily we do get on well			0
but once when we were doing a tv show for @entity38 , i was grumpy and complaining and my dad kept saying ' come on , you 're fine , this is what you have to do			2
' ' if a colleague had been telling me what to do in those circumstances i would have taken it on board			0
but as it was my dad i reverted to being like @entity49 's @entity48 and became like a petulant teenager , shouting ' i do n't want to ! ' but he added that it 's a privilege to be able to work alongside his theatrical father , 66			1
like father , life son : the pair said they get on well as they 're ' both lairy ' @entity29 said : ' it happened by chance as i never intended to go into showbiz			1
but then i got some presenting work and dad was on @entity64 and @entity65			2
suddenly we were getting invited to all the same events and opportunities came up like this to work together			2
' it is a rare and lovely thing to be able to share your profession with your parents and take them to work with you			0
' @entity5 added that the father - son tables will be turned as it will be him learning the ropes from @entity29 as they broadcast from his home studio			1
he said : ' my career has always been in tv and suddenly i 'm going to be doing what my boy has been doing for years working on the radio			0
' but the @entity83 are n't the only father and son duo currently ruling the airwaves			2
comedian @entity88 and his father , @entity89 , have been doing stand up comedy and their own tv show together			2
rise and shine : @entity29 and @entity5 will hope to brighten up monday morning for the quarter of @entity94 who dread the start of a new week speaking of the pair , @entity5 said : ' i 've seen their show and they have an interesting dynamic as they are a real contrast			1
@entity88 is so lively and out going and his dad is very low key			0
' @entity29 chimes in that they contrast to them as ' we 're both lairy '			1
explaining why they get on so well , @entity29 joked : ' we 've always got on and have been like mates because when i was growing up my dad was n't the disciplinarian			1
it was my mother who ruled the house with an iron fist ! ' however the pair wo n't spend @entity120 day together this year as both will be working - @entity5 on @entity122 and @entity29 volunteering at @entity123			1
@entity5 admits he is something of a @entity125 so @entity120 is n't preserved as special family time - especially as he has often had to work in the past over the festive season in pantomimes			1
hopeful : @entity5 said he would love a tv reunion with his on - screen son and wife , @entity134 and @entity135 , in @entity65 but it 's in the hands of writers @entity137 and @entity139 @entity29 said : ' he 's constantly ducking out of @entity120 which is n't in keeping with his usual sunny disposition ! so we wo n't spend @entity120 day together but will have some family time at some point			1
' those living in hope of @entity5 one day returning to @entity147 screens in a @entity65 special will be sadly disappointed though			0
' there 's more chance of getting kicked to death by a donkey on @entity153 , ' is how he put it			0
but the actor said he would be delighted if writers @entity137 and @entity139 did decide to revive the much - loved sitcom - for a @entity120 special , new series or even on the stage			0
he said : ' perhaps we might do a stage show in the future like @entity163			0
i 'm sure all the cast would jump at the chance for a tv reunion			0
i was talking to @entity135 ( who played his wife on the show ) the other day about how we would love to do it again , it was a wonderful part of all our lives			0
' meanwhile , @entity5 will content himself by trying to cheer up listeners on monday with their radio show which will feature surprise celebrity guests , music and quirky themed segments			0
@entity29 and @entity179 are working with @entity180 to kick start your week with @entity182			2
