a @entity1 engineer has created a unique hi - tech ring to propose to his fiance - which lights up when he is nearby			1
36 year old @entity5 , who works for an electronics firm , spent five months perfecting the ring before finally giving it his fiance @entity9 , 35 - and said she was so excited by it she did n't let him finish his proposal speech			1
hidden inside the ring are tiny leds which light up when @entity5 is nearby , illuminating the stones in the titanium ring			1
@entity5 and his fiance @entity9 - who accepted the hi - tech proposal embedded in the ring is a copper coild and a series of tiny leds			1
when they are in close proximity to an induced alternating magnetic field , which is housed in a special armband , the leds light up under the stones			2
however , the armband needs to be within 3 - 4 inches at the moment - something @entity5 hopes to improve in the wedding ring			1
@entity5 told @entity31 creating the ring took five months			2
' i knew i wanted to build it , but did n't know how - i 'm an engineer , so think about this kind of thing all the time , ' he said			2
' i spent a lot of time thinking about how to propose , and started to think about the ring you see today			1
i started work on it in january , and then finally proposed in mid-may			0
' wrapped within the interior of the ring is a coil of copper , which generates a current when exposed to an alternating magnetic field			2
to supply the field , @entity5 built a wrist - mounted device that he could wear and easily conceal , as well as surreptitiously activate when the time came			0
' it is quite bulky , and you need to be within 3 - 4 inches , but i managed to hide it under my jacket , he said			0
' several designs were considered and were rejected because of exotic material requirements , machining geometry limitations or violating the laws of physics			0
' it was a fun exercise to explore potential and unique designs , but at the end of the day , i still needed to make her something that i could present and that did n't look like it was carved with a spoon , ' he said			0
the glowing ring is made from titanium - and contains tiny leds which light up when a transmitter is nearby inside the ring : copper conducting wires and the leds are clearly visible as the ring was under construction however , the proposal did not go according to plan			1
' we live in @entity1 , and across the bay is a hill , so i wanted to hike there at dusk , and propose			1
however , it was really foggy - so after hiking for an hour , we had to abandon the plan , so we can back to the city and i proposed there			0
' once the proposal finally happened , @entity5 said the only problem with @entity9 's reaction was that it did n't allow him to finish his speech			0
the transmitter armband that makes the ring glow - and which @entity5 says easily fitted under his jacket , and was not spotted by his fiance an early prototype of the ring , showing it glowing as it is placed near the transmitter armband ' i had a little speech prepared , and she would n't let me get through it - she just started telling me how amazing it was			1
' the plan was to present the ring then get a professional ring made - but she said she wanted a permanent version of this instead , so i am building that now , as unfortunately the electronics in this version made it slightly too small for her to wear every day			0
' the permanent version will become @entity9 's wedding ring , he said			0
mr @entity5 is now building a permanent wedding ring for his fiance that will include the technology			0
