it proved too much too soon for @entity2 's @entity1 as the @entity3 was prematurely brought back from injury to replace countryman and captain @entity6 in the first half against @entity8			1
what ensued was a night to forget for the former @entity11 man as he encountered @entity13 ace @entity12 in an especially audacious mood for the @entity15 , who take a 3 - 1 lead to the @entity18 after the @entity20 's deadly double			2
with his side already 1 - 0 down through the imposing combination of @entity22 and @entity23 , the night went from bad to worse when @entity1 pulled up his socks to take the pitch after 21 minutes			0
@entity12 torments a less - than - fit @entity1 on a night to forget at @entity27 for the @entity3 @entity12 celebrates as he scores a double in @entity8 's 3 - 1 win over @entity2 on wednesday night a handful for any defender in the world at the best of times , let alone one not fully fit after a hamstring problem and thrust into the @entity37 cauldron , a rampant @entity12 scored an impressive double at @entity1 's expense			1
unfortunately for @entity1 , both of the @entity20 goals came about after @entity12 cheekily nutmegged him and , unsurprisingly , internet jokers had a field day			0
standing tall or rooted to the ground ? this web jokester likens @entity1 to @entity47 's famous @entity46 this is just nuts ! @entity1 holds a superimposed jar of @entity50 in front of a @entity47 skyline in another meme @entity1 is spared in this one as the @entity2 badge takes centre stage familiar faces went head - to - head as @entity59 defender @entity1 met @entity13 star @entity12 - @entity61 from the @entity63 films had the words - in @entity65 no less - to say it all			0

@entity8 beat @entity2 3 - 1 in the @entity37
injured @entity1 forced into the fray after @entity6 *limped* off
@entity12 nutmegged @entity1 in lead up to both of his goals
the internet soon filled with memes at the @entity3 's expense
