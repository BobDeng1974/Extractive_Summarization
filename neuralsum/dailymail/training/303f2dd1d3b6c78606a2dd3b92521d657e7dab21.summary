bedbugs have become a growing problem around the world , with epidemics @entity3 and other world cities			2
however , researchers have found an unlikely solution - kidney bean leaves			1
inspired by a traditional @entity10 bedbug remedy , researchers found microscopic hairs on kidney bean leaves effectively stab and trap the biting insects			1
although not known to transmit disease , their bites can cause burning , itching , swelling and psychological distress			2
it helps to catch infestations early , but the nocturnal parasites ’ ability to hide almost anywhere , breed rapidly and “ hitchhike ” from place to place makes detection difficult			2
they can survive as long as a year without a blood meal			0
current commercial prevention methods , including freezing , extreme heating , vacuuming and pesticides , can be costly and unreliable			0
scientists at @entity45 and the @entity46 are now developing materials that mimic the geometry of the leaves , according to findings published today in the @entity51			1
their work was motivated by a centuries - old remedy for bedbugs used in @entity55 , @entity56 and other southeast @entity58 countries			1
kidney bean leaves were strewn on the floor next to beds and seemed to ensnare the blood - seeking parasites on their nightly forays			1
the bug - encrusted greenery was burned the next morning to exterminate the insects			1
through painstaking detective work , the scientists discovered that the creatures are trapped within seconds of stepping on a leaf , their legs impaled by microscopic hooked hairs known botanically as trichomes			1
using the bean leaves as templates , the researchers have microfabricated materials that closely resemble them geometrically			1
the synthetic surfaces snag the bedbugs temporarily but do not yet stop them as effectively as real leaves , @entity79 said , suggesting that crucial mechanics of the trichomes still need to be @entity85 , bean leaves could be used for pest control , but they dry out and do n’t last very long			1
they also ca n’t easily be applied to locations other than a floor			0
synthetic materials could provide a nontoxic alternative			1
close - up of the bedbugs getting caught on a kidney bean hair , which researcher now hope to replicate in artificial materials ' plants exhibit extraordinary abilities to entrap insects , ' said @entity101 , lead author of the paper			1
' modern scientific techniques let us fabricate materials at a microscopic level , with the potential to ‘ not let the bedbugs bite ’ without pesticides			1
' “ nature is a hard act to follow , but the benefits could be enormous , ” said @entity110 of the @entity46			0
' imagine if every bedbug inadvertently brought into a dwelling was captured before it had a chance to bite and multiply			2
' funding for the study was provided by the @entity119			0
common adult @entity120 ( @entity15 lectularius			0
) bedbugs , or cimicidae , are small parasitic insects that feed on human blood			2
reddish - brown , flattened , oval shaped and wingless , adult bed bugs grow to 4 – 5mm in length and 1.5 – 3mm wide			0
to feed , the pests pierce the skin of their hosts with two hollow feeding tubes shaped like tongues			0
with one tube it injects its saliva , which contains anticoagulants and anaesthetics , while with the other it sucks the blood of its host			0
it takes between five to ten minutes for a bed bug to become completely engorged , after which it usually returns to its hiding place			0
bedbugs can cause a number of health effects including skin rashes and allergic symptoms			0
worryingly , they have been found with methicillin - resistant @entity154			2
the creatures were largely eradicated in the developed world in the early @entity157 , but since 1995 they have enjoyed an unwelcome resurgence , the reasons for which are unclear			0
elusive and usually nocturnal , bedbugs can be hard to spot			0
aside from bite symptoms , signs include faecal spots , blood smears on sheets , and molts			0
they can be found singly , but often congregate once established			2

traditional @entity10 bedbug remedy found to be extremely effective
researchers found microscopic hairs on kidney bean leaves stab and trap the biting insects
now plan to create artificial materials using the same technique
