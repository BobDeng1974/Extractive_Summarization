one @entity1 company has discovered an ingenious way to combat the problem of food wastage ... by converting udon noodles into electricity			1
in total , the company generates 180,000 @entity9 of electricity each year , enough to power about 50 households			1
@entity12 work with local udon producers and restaurants in @entity15 , @entity16 to convert the methane released by the wheat noodles into energy			1
there are 800 udon noodle restaurants in the coastal city of @entity15			0
with the new tecnology the city 's food waste is now converted to enough energy to power 50 households in the coastal city of @entity15 , there are 800 restaurants all serving the region 's speciality , @entity29			1
in a city of 400,000 inhabitants , that 's one udon restaurant for every 500 inhabitants			0
at a local factory , @entity36 , udon noodles are produced and packaged , ready to be shipped all over @entity1			1
every day , a maximum of 100,000 portions of udon noodles are produced			2
however only noodles with the perfect length and size are sold			2
everything that does n't meet the rigid criteria gets discarded , explains @entity45 , president of the company			2
' we discard about 150 tonnes of udon noodles every year , ' says @entity45			1
' and that is not just from this factory , but also includes seven udon restaurants that produce @entity36 - udon noodles in the @entity45 prefecture			2
' every day , a maximum of 100,000 portions of udon noodles are produced approximately 150 tonnes of udon noodles are discarded every year due to imperfections until recently , the udon waste rotted away in landfills , releasing methane , a potent greenhouse gas			1
but with @entity12 's technology , the gas is put to good use			1
at the company 's plant , the dry udon noodles are first ground up to increase the surface area before being mixed with water			2
the mixture then undergoes a fermentation process and various stages of purification which turns 10 per cent of it into ethanol			0
different temperature levels are used to separate water from ethanol			0
ethanol is a highly combustible fuel which can be used for energy production and other purposes			2
the company uses the remaining 90 per cent to produce biogases such as methane , which is used to generate electricity			1
the process is still in testing phase and the engineers are working to optimise it			0
@entity91 , engineer and head of @entity93 at @entity12 , explained : ' no matter how hard we try , there will always be some residue			1
so we are working on reusing the residue and developing a process that produces no waste at all			2
' dry udon noodles are first ground up to increase the surface area before being mixed with water			0
the mixture then undergoes a fermentation process which turns 10 per cent of it into ethanol currently , the company is working on turning the runoff liquid into a fertiliser for wheat and onion , which are ingredients and toppings , respectively , for a bowl of udon			0
thus , the waste recycling scheme goes full circle			0
in exchange for receiving the waste noodles for free , the company does not charge anything for picking up the waste from the restaurants and factories			1
@entity124 , president of @entity12 , emphasises the importance of recycling schemes like this			1
' biomass based recycling schemes are increasingly popular here in @entity1			0
this is just the beginning			0
it is our task to promote and spread this technique further , ' he says			0
back at the restaurant , people are enjoying their daily bowl of udon			0
a customer has already heard of the udon recycling scheme and is impressed by it			0
but would he leave some of the udon in his bowl behind on purpose , knowing that it will be used to generate electricity ? ' no. when i eat udon , it becomes my energy , so there is nothing wasted there			1
' it seems the schemes biggest challenge is convincing locals to stop eating all their noodles			0
@entity160 are thick , white noodles made from wheat flour and are typically served in a fish or miso broth .			1

@entity12 changes methane from waste into energy
150 tonnes of wheat noodles are discarded due to imperfections
technology generates 180,000 @entity9 of electricity a year
