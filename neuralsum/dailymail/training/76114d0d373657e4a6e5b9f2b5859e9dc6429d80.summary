by @entity0 published : 05:59 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 08:12 est , 9 september 2013 technology used to understand distant planets has helped reconstruct two ornate @entity4 tombs that were destroyed during @entity7 's @entity6 offensive			1
the tombs were commissioned by @entity11 , the third @entity12 , in the 16th century for @entity13 in @entity14 and when the priory was dissolved in 1540 , some parts of the tombs were salvaged while others were abandoned in the ruins until they were excavated in the 1930s			1
the @entity19 , part of the @entity21 of @entity22 and @entity23 used these artefacts , along with drawings and @entity27 computer scanning technology that is currently used to construct how planets would have looked , to virtually reassemble two of the @entity29			1
this image shows what one of the @entity29 , designed for @entity13 in @entity14 in the 16th century , would have looked like if it had been completed			1
the @entity19 , at @entity32 used artefacts , along with drawings and 3d computer scanning technology to virtually construct the tombs in 1540 , @entity13 was dissolved before the tombs could be finished and although some parts were salvaged other parts were abandoned in the ruins of the priory , pictured the tombs were commissioned by @entity11 , the third @entity12 , in the 16th century for @entity13 in @entity14			1
the @entity12 , who was the uncle of two of @entity7 's ill - fated wives , @entity44 and @entity46 , wanted one of the tombs for himself			2
the other was reserved for @entity7 's illegitimate son , @entity50 , @entity50			0
but after @entity7 broke with the @entity51 , creating a @entity52 separate from papal rule , he dissolved monasteries , friaries and priories across the country			2

but after @entity7 broke with the @entity51 , creating a @entity52 separate from papal rule , he dissolved monasteries , friaries and priories across the country			2
during this time , @entity11 fell from favour and was only saved from death because @entity7 himself died the night before @entity11 's scheduled execution			0
part of the virtual construction process involved using various artefacts from museums across the country and piecing them together			2
once the tomb was virtually constructed , the team at @entity32 , disassembled it , pictured , in order to see how it would have been created this baluster , or moulded , shaft was excavated from the ruins of @entity13 in 1935 ‘ our exhibition studies the catastrophic effects of the @entity84 and of @entity7 's attempted destruction of @entity11 , third duke of @entity14 , on the ducal tomb - monuments at @entity13 , ’ said dr @entity78 , of the @entity32 ’s @entity79 and @entity80			1
‘ using 3d laser scanning and 3d prints , we have - virtually - dismantled the monuments at @entity90 and recombined them with the parts left at @entity13 in 1540 , to try to reconstruct the monuments as they were first intended , in a mixture of the virtual and the real			1
‘ the museum is a few hundred yards from the priory site where the tomb - monuments were first carved nearly five hundred years ago			0
‘ @entity99 is itself a @entity4 building and it is a surprising thought that the original sculptors probably walked past the very building in which we are now exhibiting their work			0
’ @entity32 worked with @entity106 and @entity107 universities as well as the @entity108 and the @entity109 and @entity110			0
the research was part of a study by the ‘ @entity115 ’ project team			0
it was funded by a grant from the @entity118			0
the parts of the tombs that were n't abandoned were taken away and used to form another tomb , using different materials			1
this tomb can now be found in the @entity124 , @entity90 , @entity125			0
when the priory was dissolved , some artefacts were taken and used to construct a different tomb , using different materials			1
this tomb , pictured , is currently located at the @entity124 , @entity90 , @entity125			0

the tombs were intended for @entity13 which was dissolved in 1540
some parts were salvaged and later finished off in a different style
researchers used original artefacts , drawings and 3d techniques , to piece together a *digital* picture of what the tombs may have looked like
