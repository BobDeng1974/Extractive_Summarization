by @entity0 it is said that there are plenty more fish in the sea , but the popular maxim no longer holds true as fish are said to be on the road to extinction			0
reports in 2010 found that over-fishing and pollution is depleting the world 's fish stocks , and now a team of scientists claims to have discovered how			1
they state that 90 per cent of fish larvae are biologically doomed to die just days after hatching , because of the viscosity , or ' stickiness ' of the water in which they are born			1
on the verge of extinction ? a team of scientists have found that 90 per cent of fish larvae ( pictured ) are biologically doomed to die just days after hatching because pollution makes the water they 're born into viscous , and this slows them down when looking for food around 90 per cent of fish larvae are biologically doomed to die just days after hatching			1
the study found that ‘ hydrodynamic starvation , ’ or the physical inability to feed due to environmental incompatibility , is the reason so many fish larvae perish			1
the ‘ stickiness ’ or the viscosity of ocean water hampers the larvae ’s attempts to feed			1
‘ all that determines the larvae 's feeding ability is viscosity - not age , not development – only their interaction with the surrounding water , dr @entity45 explained			1
‘ because the water molecules around you have weak electrical bonds , only a thin layer sticks to your skin - a mere millimetre thick			2
if you 're a large organism , you hardly feel it			0
‘ but if you 're a three - millimetre - sized larva , dragging a millimetre of water across your body will prevent you from propelling forward to feed			2
‘ so really , it ’s all about larval size and its ability to grow fast and escape the size where it feels the water as viscous fluid			2
’ the researchers found that in less viscous water , the larvae improved their feeding ability and in theory , this water would increase their survival rate			2
and this stickiness is increased by pollution			0
a scarcity of fish spells disaster for over a billion people around the world who are dependent on fish for their main source of protein			0
the study , by @entity45 and @entity89 of the @entity90 at @entity91 , follows the 2010 report by the @entity93			1
the research , which was conducted at the @entity95 in @entity96 , and published in @entity97 , suggests that ‘ hydrodynamic starvation , ’ or the physical inability to feed due to environmental incompatibility , is the reason so many fish larvae perish			1
nearly all fish species reproduce externally – releasing and abandoning their sperm and eggs into the water			0
the fertilised eggs hatch within a couple of days and the larvae must feed themselves			0
they had previously fed on a yolk sac – a membrane joined to an embryo to provide early nourishment in the form of yolk – but once hatched , the vast majority die			0
‘ we thought , something is going on during this period , in which the proportional number of larvae dying is greatest , ’ dr @entity45 said			1
‘ our goal was to pinpoint the mechanism causing them to die			0
disaster looming : a scarcity of fish spells disaster for over a billion people around the world who are dependent on fish for their main source of protein			0
a major report in 2010 blamed pollution levels and overfishing for the state of affairs			0
a fisherman casting his net in a lake in southern @entity143 is pictured ' we saw that even under the best controlled conditions , 70 per cent of fish larvae were dying within the two weeks known as the ' critical period , ' when the larvae detach from the yolk sac and open their mouths to feed , ’ said dr. @entity45			1
dr @entity45 said that using their understanding of the mechanism that kills off fish larvae , could help ' find a solution to the looming fish crisis in the world '			1
a school of larval fish is pictured over two years , the researchers observed fish larvae at three significant points in their development - at eight , 13 and 23 - days - old , or the beginning , middle , and end of that ‘ critical period ’			1
they found that the ‘ stickiness ’ or the viscosity of the surrounding ocean water was hampering the larvae ’s attempts to feed			1
polluted seawater is typically more viscous than clean water , and cooler water is slightly gloopier than warmer bodies of water			0
‘ all that determines the larvae 's feeding ability is viscosity - not age , not development – only their interaction with the surrounding water , dr @entity45 explained			2
‘ because the water molecules around you have weak electrical bonds , only a thin layer sticks to your skin - a mere millimetre thick			0
if you 're a large organism , you hardly feel it			0
‘ but if you 're a three - millimetre - sized larva , dragging a millimetre of water across your body will prevent you from propelling forward to feed			2
‘ so really , it ’s all about larval size and its ability to grow fast and escape the size where it feels the water as viscous fluid			0
’ the researchers found that in less viscous water , the larvae improved their feeding ability and in theory , this water would increase their survival rate			2
‘ we conclude that hydrodynamic starvation is the reason for their dying , ’ dr. @entity45 said			2
‘ imagine eating soup with a fork – that 's what it 's like for these larvae			0
they 're not developed enough at the critical point to adopt the constrained feeding strategy of adult - sized , better - developed fish			0
’ dr @entity45 said that by using their understanding of the mechanism that kills off the majority of the world ’s fish larvae , it could help ‘ find a solution to the looming fish crisis in the world			1
’ armed with this knowledge of the larvae 's biological flaw , the researchers are currently patenting a solution to maintain higher survival rates among fish larvae populations .			1

researchers from @entity91 in @entity243 have discovered why 90 per cent of fish larvae are dying - causing a fishing crisis
*experts* revealed that physical inability to feed due to environmental *problems* is the reason so many fish larvae perish
they found the ‘ stickiness ’ or the viscosity of water was hampering the larvae ’s attempts to feed
study follows a 2010 report by the @entity262 's @entity93 , which declared over-fishing and pollution has depleted the world 's fish stocks
