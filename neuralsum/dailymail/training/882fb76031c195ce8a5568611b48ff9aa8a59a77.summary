by @entity1 reporter breakthrough ? scientists at @entity3 found @entity4 is rare near the equator @entity7 may be able to combat multiple sclerosis , researchers said yesterday			1
they discovered that it can block the migration of destructive cells to the brain , which causes the condition			2
this could help explain anecdotal reports that the ‘ sunshine vitamin ’ prevents or eases symptoms			0
@entity4 is most commonly found far from the equator , where there is less sunshine to trigger production of vitamin d in the skin			2
the disease is caused by the body ’s own immune defences damaging myelin , a fatty insulating sheath that surrounds nerve fibres and is vital to the proper transmission of nerve signals			0
destruction of myelin leads to symptoms ranging from numbness to blurred vision and paralysis			0
researchers simultaneously gave mice the rodent form of @entity4 and a high dose of @entity7 they found symptoms of the disease were suppressed			1
‘ @entity7 might be working not by altering the function of damaging immune cells but by preventing their journey into the brain , ’ said lead scientist @entity45 , of @entity46 in @entity47			1
in a person with @entity4 , immune system cells called t - cells are primed to travel out from the lymph nodes and seek and destroy myelin in the central nervous system			1
while large numbers of t - cells were found in the bloodstreams of the mice , very few were detected in their brains and spinal cords			1
' @entity7 does n’t seem to cause global immunosuppression , ' said dr @entity45			2
' what ’s interesting is that the t - cells are primed , but they are being kept away from the places in the body where they can do the most damage			1
' tests : researchers found @entity7 suppressed symptoms of blurred visions and mobility issues in mice the vitamin may slow production of a sticky substance that allows the t - cells to attach onto blood vessel walls , she added			1
this may help to keep them in circulation and prevent their migration to the brain			0
once vitamin d was withdrawn from the mice , @entity4 flare - ups occurred very quickly , said the researchers , whose findings appear in the journal @entity95			2
@entity97 , a professor of neurology at @entity46 and co-author of the study , said : ' @entity7 may be a very safe therapy , but we still have to be careful with it			0
it ’s not just a vitamin			0
it ’s actually a hormone			0
' a clinical trial testing the effect of vitamin d supplements on patients with @entity4 is currently under way at @entity46 .			0

disease is most common far from the equator , @entity47 researchers found
tests on mice suppressed amounts of t - cells found near brain and spine
scientists warn care needs to be taken as @entity7 is a hormone
