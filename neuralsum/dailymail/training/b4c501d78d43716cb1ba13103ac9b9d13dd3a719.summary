by @entity0 , science reporter published : 10:54 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 10:58 est , 28 february 2013 we all know that talking while driving can be distracting			2
but it is a ' recipe for disaster ' when done while attempting a tricky right - hand turn into oncoming traffic , according to scientists			1
scans showed that performing simple tasks , such as driving straight , resulted in minimal brain activation , while undertaking a difficult manoeuvre needed the most brain power			1
danger : using a mobile while driving is now illegal in the @entity16 ( photo posed by model ) researchers found the activity in parts of the brain that deal with vision and decision - making - needed to tackle a right - hand turn - is ' significantly reduced ' when chatting			1
the @entity26 research team said the results have ' important implications regarding distracted driving ' and the use of hands - free car kits			1
' our findings suggest that the distracted brain sacrificed areas important for visual attention and alertness to recruit enough brain resources to perform a secondary , cognitive task [ speaking ] , ' the report concluded			0
lead author dr @entity43 , director at @entity45 's @entity44 in @entity46 , said when @entity16 drivers perform a right turn while talking , it ' could be the most dangerous thing they ever do on the road '			0
he said : ' in theory , turning right is the most difficult aspect of driving in @entity16 , because you having to consider oncoming traffic , traffic lights , and if pedestrians are crossing in the lane you are turning into			1
' with hands - free kits , despite the fact that you are not holding on to a device , you are still being distracted from the primary task of driving			1
there is only so much brain resources available			0
use your head : brain scans revealed that chatting , whether or not it was on the phone , affected drivers ' abilities to react ( photo posed by model ) ' in crude terms , when we are talking , parts of the visual system shut down to allow the communications system to come on line			1
so less of our brain is devoted to the task of driving			2
' the research , published in the journal frontiers in @entity85 , involving testing 16 young drivers who were operating a driving simulator equipped with a steering wheel , brake pedal and accelerator inside an @entity92 brain scanner			1
this allowed them to map in real time which parts of the brain were activated or deactivated as the simulator took participants through increasingly difficult driving manoeuvres			2
tasks included making turns at intersections with or without oncoming traffic or driving with distractions that mimicked talking on a hands free mobile phone or engaging in a conversation with a passenger			2
' this study provides real - time neuroimaging evidence supporting previous behavioural observations suggesting that multitasking while driving may compromise vision and alertness			2
hands free not does mean brains free , ' said dr @entity43			0
' we have finite resources , and when we begin a discussion , the brain starts to shift resources			0
but you need all these resources to carry out a complicated driving manoeuvre safely			0
' the brain data showed that a distraction really does reduce the brain 's ability to react drastically			0
' the scientists warned that car manufacturers may also have to reconsider the design of vehicles , which increasingly have in - built devices that can be a distraction to drivers			0
the report found : ' automobile manufacturers also have a responsibility to improve safety by refraining from installing various communication devices in vehicles , or by installing deactivation systems if drivers attempt to use the devices while the car is in motion			0

@entity26 research team called chatting while driving a ' recipe for disaster '
driving in a straight line requires minimal brain power , while turning - especially into traffic - is more demanding
