by @entity0 published : 04:07 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 06:33 est , 10 october 2013 with the wind whipping their ears and their jowls flapping in the breeze , a car ride is normally loved by dogs who enjoy sticking their head out of the window			2
but for one nervous pooch , taking a drive is a frightening thing - and the only way he feels safe is clutching his owner 's hand with his paw			1
a video uploaded to @entity20 shows adorable @entity21 sitting in the passenger seat while his owner drives			1
@entity21 starts nudging him with his head , tries to wriggle on to his lap , and frantically pats him with his paw , letting him know that he does n't quite enjoy the ride			1
he only calms down when his owner , called @entity49 , eventually clutches his paw and he visibly relaxes			1
the video has already been viewed thousands of times , with @entity20 commentators telling @entity49 how adorable the video is			2
@entity21 gets a little nervous - but calms down when his owner holds his paw as they go for a ride he replied : ' ca n't believe so many people like the video			1
i only uploaded to video to see what the @entity20 video editor ï»¿ was like so did n't expect this at all			0
' i 'll be sure to stick up a few more of @entity21 's antics - maybe outside of the car though , a lot of you seem to be concerned about my driving , which i can assure you was perfectly safe ; )			2
glad you all liked it though			0
' the driver assured watchers that he used a stand to hold his phone in place and was on a quiet road , so there was no danger to other motorists or pedestrians			2
there 's no way @entity21 would stick his head out of the window - but at least he feels safer when he 's holding @entity49 his owner perhaps he needs some driving lessons , like some of the rescued dogs who are being taught the skills behind the wheel in @entity89			1
in december last year , a charity introduced a canine driving school , aimed at proving how intelligent the animals can be			0
it showed them responding to commands , steering the wheel , change gears and hit the brake , the @entity93 reported			0
there is no scientific explanation as to why most dogs love going for car rides			0
some believe that they enjoy the higher view point , and like to see the world from a different angle , instead of having to constantly look up			0
another popular explanation is that by sticking their head out of the window , they can smell lots of different scents with their powerful noses .			0
