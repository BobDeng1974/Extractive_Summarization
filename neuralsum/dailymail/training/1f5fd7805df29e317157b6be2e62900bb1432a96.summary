@entity0 gained a double first from @entity2 , @entity3 before becoming a lawyer , mp , minister and @entity8 commissioner @entity0 was today hailed as ' by far and away the most brilliant of his generation ' after a stellar career which took him from @entity11 to the @entity12			1
born on september 25 1939 , the son of a north @entity15 doctor who had emigrated from @entity16 , @entity0 was brought up in the orthodox jewish tradition			1
he won a scholarship from his state primary school to @entity21 's @entity20 in @entity11 and went to gain a double first from @entity2 , @entity3			1
at @entity23 he became president of the @entity25 and chairman of the @entity27			1
in 1961 , he was called to the @entity28 and pursued a successful career as a libel lawyer , taking silk in 1978			1
but his ambitions to enter the @entity12 were frustrated for 10 years			2
he fought and lost @entity33 in 1966 and 1970 , and was rejected as @entity35 candidate by more than a dozen safer @entity35 seats			2
finally , he was elected for @entity37 and @entity38 in 1974			1
before long he was in mrs @entity40 's shadow team , first as a deputy spokesman on devolution and then in employment			2
when she won the 1979 election , @entity0 became minister of state at the @entity46			1
within two years he was in the @entity47 as chief secretary to the treasury			1
only days before that promotion he married divorcee @entity50 , who had two daughters			2
in this post , he was an instant success , courteous and decisive and quickly aware of areas where compromises could be successfully reached in his battle to keep public spending under control			2
but a cloud on the horizon was the projected disappearance of his parliamentary constituency			2
@entity0 , despite his proven ability , had trouble finding another seat to fight			2
but the intervention of the then - home secretary , @entity68 , helped him to gain the safe seat of @entity70 , @entity71			1
after the 1983 @entity35 landslide , @entity0 became the youngest home secretary since @entity74			1
but he got off to a bad start when mps decisively rejected his advice to restore hanging for terrorist murders			2
his handling of the @entity81 embassy siege brought him back to public favour , and it was at that stage that he became talked about as a possible future leader			2
when @entity40 won the 1979 election , @entity0 became minister of state at the @entity46			1
within two years he was in the @entity47 as chief secretary to the @entity88 after the 1983 @entity35 landslide , @entity0 became the youngest home secretary since @entity74 but his apparently unstoppable rise was halted and then reversed by two issues			1
his decision to ask the @entity92 not to transmit a programme on @entity95 terrorism made him the target of accusations of censorship and of handing the @entity99 as major propaganda victory			1
all this made him a liability and mrs @entity40 transferred him to trade and industry , which everyone except him regarded as demotion			1
but within weeks he was caught up in the battle over @entity108			0
@entity0 and the rest of the @entity47 wanted an @entity111 rescue package to save the company , while @entity113 alone wanted a @entity115 solution , and openly campaigned for one against all his @entity47 colleagues			0
there followed the leaked letter and then @entity0 was forced to apologise to mps for allegedly misleading them over a confidential letter to @entity40 from @entity121 , part of the @entity115 consortium bidding to rescue @entity108			0
he gained some support with a fighting commons performance , denying he had lied to the @entity12 about an alleged meeting with @entity128 chief executive sir @entity127			0
but hours later , sir @entity127 issued a long statement contradicting @entity132 's version of events			0
later , sir @entity127 amended that by saying there had been a ' misunderstanding '			0
only days before his promotion to the @entity47 in 1981 @entity0 married divorcee @entity50 , who had two daughters @entity0 , in his role as vice-president of the @entity140 , answers questions at a press conference in @entity143 it was too late			0
the @entity146 of @entity35 back - benchers demanded his resignation and despite pleas by @entity40 for him to stay , @entity0 had to quit			0
but he took this devastating blow with equanimity			0
' i am bruised , ' he said			0
' but i am certainly not bowed			0
and i 'm not looking back , nor in any state of nostalgia			0
' @entity0 was appointed a @entity115 commissioner in 1989 and a year later became vice-president of the @entity140			1
he stayed in @entity156 for a decade and it was during this time he gave the now - @entity158 deputy prime minister @entity158 a job in his office			0
he returned to @entity161 in 2000 as @entity0 of @entity162 but remained low key until prime minister @entity164 gave him a job as a trade adviser in 2010			0
last year , he was put in the spotlight when allegations of historic sex abuse emerged and home secretary @entity170 set up an inquiry to investigate			1
lord @entity0 leaving his @entity173 home in @entity15 on july 8 last year after becoming embroiled in the @entity161 paedophile scandal in which he was accused of failing to deal properly with allegations of child abuse lord @entity0 was likely to be called to give evidence over a dossier he received from mp @entity179 in 1983 , documenting the alleged involvement of vip figures in a child sex ring			1
he had flatly denied failing to act on the abuse file			0
the second woman appointed to chair the investigation , @entity185 , was forced to quit over links to him - she was a neighbour			1
last july , @entity0 confirmed he was interviewed by police about a ' serious allegation ' , but insisted that the accusation was ' wholly without foundation '			0
it followed press reports that he had been questioned under caution by police in connection with an allegation of rape dating back to 1967			0
