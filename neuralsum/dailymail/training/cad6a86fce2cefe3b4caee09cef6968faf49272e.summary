a brand new camera drone designed to capture amazing @entity2 footage from the sky suffered a major malfunction for one owner			1
@entity6 was out using his @entity7 1 , which retails for $ 2,900 , and wanted to test out the auto - takeoff , thinking he would use the device for some real estate images eventually			1
unfortunately , the drone thought that straight ahead towards the garage was the best way to travel up , and was smashed to pieces			1
the drone waits on the ground before it is set to takeoff the drone , on auto takeoff , is supposed to go up and elevate until it reaches a cruising altitude instead the drone flew straight into the garage and was smashed @entity6 ( above ) the owner of the drone was not controlling it at all at the time ' last couple of flights not stable on auto take off - shimming and drifting			1
wanted to record if it drifted to send to dji to get settings changed or trouble shoot the issues as it crashed earlier in the am - but was fine 2 times after just a lot of shimming and bobbing in the desert in the open or in the subdivision of the house i was trying to film , ' wrote @entity6 on @entity38			2
' we went out and checked everything recalibrated the compass again even though we had n't moved - and this happened with no operator input just in auto take off mode			2
' no word if the cost of the drone gets refunded in this case , or of the device can be repaired			0
and it most certainly was not @entity6 's fault says @entity6			0
' this was not operator error , ' he told @entity55			0
' to all the people who say i ca nâ€™t fly , wrong : i have dozens and dozens of flights			0
[ @entity60 ] started with a @entity61 , upgraded to a @entity63 840h ground station , you name it			0
