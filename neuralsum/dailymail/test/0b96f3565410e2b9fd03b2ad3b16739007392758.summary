with just 26 days until the election , the prime minister is already showing the strain of a punishing campaign trail			0
at a visit to the @entity6 in @entity7 yesterday , @entity4 appeared weary with bags under his eyes and disheveled hair			1
in one day this week the @entity12 leader travelled to all all four home nations in his bid to secure votes ahead of the may 7 election			1
on thursday mr @entity4 was been forced to defend @entity26 after the defence secretary claimed @entity28 would stab @entity30 â€™s national interest in the back in the same way he did his brother to gain the @entity36 leadership			1
the prime minister was also dealt a blow as @entity28 overtook him as the most popular political leader for the first time			1
in a shock result that sent shockwaves through @entity43 , the @entity36 leader jumped ahead of the prime minister in personal approval ratings			2
not impressed : six - year - old @entity46 looked positively uninterested as the prime minister read a story at @entity49 near @entity50 earlier this week the @entity36 also took a commanding four point lead over the @entity52 , according to the pollsters @entity53			2
on wednesday , mr @entity4 failed to get the desired response from a six - year - old schoolgirl who looked positively uninterested as he read a story to her classmates at @entity49 near @entity50			0
yesterday , another campaign gaffe saw mr @entity4 wade into the @entity60 debate about how to eat a scone - getting the two counties contrasting traditions mixed up			0
the @entity12 leader has spent the day campaigning in @entity60 , where he must win several seats if he is to stand any chance of winning a majority			1
but his hopes of courting support in the county were given a knock with his food faux pas as he chatted with staff and customers of tea by the @entity77 on @entity78 in @entity79 , the @entity68 reported			0
@entity4 , on a visit to @entity60 this morning , made the blunder of confusing the two methods for eating a cream tea all good politicians know how to make small talk with voters , but the jam and cream debate is no trifling matter			0
in an attempt to woo the locals , mr @entity4 ventured : ' when you are in @entity60 you do the jam and the cream in a different order to @entity96 , is that right ? ' sensing a gaffe was imminent , he went on : ' i 'm going to get this wrong , are n't i ? ' his prediction was correct , as he added : ' in @entity60 it 's ... jam first and cream on top ? ' his comments were greeted with silence and stony faces , as the staff realised someone was going to have to put the prime minister right .			0
