breakthrough : @entity2 scientistst have successfully regenerated a thymus in a mouse			1
the organ is part of the immune system @entity2 scientists have been able to fully restore an organ in a living animal for the first time - a breakthrough which may pave the way for the technique to be used in humans			1
the @entity16 team have successfully rebuilt the thymus of ' very old ' mice by reactivating a natural mechanism that gets shut down with age			0
the thymus is an organ central to the immune system , found in front of the heart			2
the regenerated thymus was not only similar in structure and genetic detail to one in a young mouse , the scientists said , but was also able to function again			1
after the regeneration , the treated mice also started to make more t - cells - a type of white blood cell key to fighting infections			1
the regenerated thymus was also more than twice the size of the aged organs in the untreated mice			2
‘ by targeting a single protein , we have been able to almost completely reverse age - related shrinking of the thymus , ’ said @entity40 from @entity42 's @entity41 ( @entity41 ) @entity43 , who led the research			0
‘ our results suggest that targeting the same pathway in humans may improve thymus function and therefore boost immunity in elderly patients , or those with a suppressed immune system			0
’ she added however , that while the treated mice were making t - cells , her research could not yet establish whether the immune systems of the older mice were strengthened			2
and before the technique can be tested in humans , she said , researchers will need to conduct more animal experiments to make sure the regeneration process can be tightly controlled			0
the thymus is the first organ to deteriorate as people age			2
this shrinking is one of the main reasons the immune system becomes less effective and we lose the ability to fight off new infections , such as flu , as we get older			0
regenerative medicine is a fast - growing area of research , mainly focused on stem cells - the master cells that act as a source for all types of cells and tissues in the body			0
one of the central aims is to harness the body 's own repair mechanisms and manipulate them in a controlled way to treat disease			0
after the regeneration of the thymus , the mice also started to produce more t - cells ( pictured ) - a type of white blood cell key to fighting infections @entity101 's team , whose work was published on tuesday in the journal development , said they targeted a part of the process by which the thymus degenerates - a protein called @entity109 that helps control how key genes in the thymus are switched on			1
they used genetically modified mice to enable them to increase levels of this protein using chemical signals			0
by doing so , they managed to instruct immature cells in the thymus - similar to stem cells - to rebuild the organ in the older mice			1
@entity122 , the @entity41 's head of regenerative medicine , said this success with the mouse thymus suggests organ regeneration in mammals can be directed by manipulating a single protein - something he said could have broad implications for other areas of regenerative biology .			1

@entity2 scientists rebuild the thymus in a ' very old ' mouse
the thymus , *located* near the heart , is the first organ to deteriorate with age
the regenerated thymus also started to produced new t - cells
