he was on a rural road on the @entity38 near @entity39 , @entity40 - five miles from his home in the village of @entity44			1
police were alerted and breathalysed him after the short filmed conversation			0

when an officer arrived and asked if he was injured , @entity7 said : ' no i 'm fine , ehm the car 's quite a bit [ he mumbles a lot ] not a problem mate , sorry			1
' i was trying to turn it round that 's all , like , there 's nothing			0
obviously it 's messed up but yeah , no , there 's no problem mate , so i put the handbrake on , yeah , no , it 's a bit like , there 's no damage at all really			0
dangerous : a headlamp was knocked out of the side of the car , which police believe flipped over in the crash ' that 's old , old , old damage really that 's all			2
it 's an old injury , literally , i was just trying to turn it round like and go back down the road			2
it 's got no petrol in it basically so i was just trying to spin it round that 's all			0
' it 's an old thingy , it 's not a new thingy , it 's not a new injury , this is an old thing like , simple as that like , it 's an old thingy , it 's an old injury to the car , it 's not a new one that 's it			1
' i just tried to turn the car round and basically i 've been caught have n't i trying to turn the car round			2
the police officer said he could smell alcohol , to which @entity34 replied : ' uh , uh , uh , i have n't got a licence , i 'm a provisional licence that 's it , and i tried to turn it round and that 's it , so fair enough			1
when the officer started to caution him he said : ' yeah , do n't worry about it			0
yeah that 's fine do n't worry about it , i 've had a few drinks but i 'm not drunk '			1
police said he later gave a fake name before criticising the officers for breathalysing him			0
