@entity0 put a dampener on @entity3 's 500th appearance for @entity4 as they completed a notable double over the @entity7 leaders in emphatic fashion at @entity9			1
@entity3 was on the losing side on his debut for the @entity4 against @entity12 at @entity9 in 1997 and he was powerless to prevent a repeat on his landmark occasion , with the @entity0 running out 29 - 10 winners			1
the @entity4 were already trailing 20 - 4 when the former @entity17 skipper entered the action five minutes into the second half and it did not get much better as the @entity20 came up with their worst performance of the season in front of a 17,430 crowd			0
@entity0 forward @entity25 crosses for one of his side 's five tries on the night @entity0 had produced their best display in an 18 - 6 win over @entity4 in march and they were again outstanding , with full - back @entity31 and second rower @entity33 the pick of an impressive bunch			1
@entity4 had an early chance when prop @entity38 was held up over the line but then it was virtually all @entity0 as they established a stranglehold on the game			0
loose forward @entity43 was held up on his back before his back - row partner @entity33 produced a measured grubber kick on the last tackle to create a try for winger @entity48			0
@entity4 winger @entity49 does brilliantly to touch down in the corner it was then @entity43 's turn to demonstrate his kicking skills to get his captain @entity53 in for a second try , although there was a strong hint of a forward pass in the build - up			2
with scrum - half @entity60 causing all sorts of problems for the @entity4 defence with his penetrative running , the visitors were good value for their 8 - 0 lead and it got even better for them on 23 minutes when prop @entity69 took hooker @entity70 's pass near the line to go through a gaping hole for a third try			0
@entity31 was off target with his first two attempts at goal but it was third time lucky as he made it 14 - 0 and a @entity81 40 - 20 kick enabled @entity0 to maintain the momentum			0
@entity0 forward @entity43 is tackled by @entity84 during a frantic contest at @entity9 @entity3 stayed on the bench throughout the first half but the introduction of forward @entity89 helped perk up the @entity4 in the last 10 minutes and they pulled a try back in scintillating fashion when winger @entity49 finished off a flowing move at the corner			1
the @entity4 captain entered the action five minutes into the second half but his side were trailing 20 - 4 by then after a break by lively substitute @entity100 created the position for @entity31 to get @entity33 over for @entity0 's fourth try			2
and there was no way back for @entity3 's men when @entity48 's neat offload enabled substitute prop @entity25 to score his first try for more than 12 months			2
@entity4 veteran @entity3 made his 500th appearance for the club on friday night @entity31 kicked his third goal to stretch his side 's lead to 26 - 4 and increased it with a penalty on 63 minutes after @entity114 was pulled up for a high tackle			1
the home side pulled a try back five minutes later through @entity118 and @entity3 kicked the goal but it was little more than consolation and the @entity0 had the final say when stand - off @entity122 slotted a drop goal to open his account for the club on his third appearance .			0
