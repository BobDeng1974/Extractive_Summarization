the £ 20,000 sports car had to be written off by insurers after the device destroyed the engine			0
faulty : this automatic bollard in @entity12 , @entity13 , rose from the ground five minutes before it should have done , causing extensive damage to a @entity10 belonging to @entity8 , 34 painful : @entity8 suffered an arm injury in the incident			2
she has successfully won damages against @entity23 after @entity24 proved the bollard rose from the ground too early @entity8 and her husband @entity27 accused @entity28 of arrogance in refusing to accept it had activated before it was supposed to , forcing them to pursue their claim through the courts			1
a judge sitting at @entity34 found in the @entity36 ’ favour after @entity24 images submitted by the council proved mrs @entity8 ’s evidence that the bollard rose at 9.55am , not at 10am when it was meant to rise as the local authority claimed			1
the couple have been awarded compensation and costs but are waiting for a copy of the judge ’s findings for the exact amounts			0
@entity28 said it is waiting for a copy of the judgement to read through the details of the finding , but that it had insurance in place to pay for court related costs			0
pride and joy : @entity8 's @entity10 , which was worth £ 20,000 , at the scene of the accident mr and mrs @entity8 are calling on the council to remove the offending bollard or make it safer mr and mrs @entity8 , of @entity12 , said they feel vindicated by the judgement and called on the council to remove the rising bollard , which is still in place , or improve its safety			1
mother - of - two mrs @entity8 said : ' i ’m pleased we ’ve been successful and that we ’ve won but i ’m angry with the council for having something in place that ’s so dangerous			2
' it ’s not safe and they need to do something about it			0
the council claimed the warning lights were flashing but the light is a couple of inches across and is to the side of the bollard			0
' if you are going to put a warning light on something it should be in front of the driver like a level crossing – you should n’t have to turn your head away from the road			0
' victory : the couple are delighted after they finally won their legal battle against the council after a four - year fight mr @entity102 , 40 , said the court case had taken so long because the council had refused to accept any blame for the incident			1
he said : ' the council dug its heels in and said it was @entity8 ’s fault , that ’s why they ’ve gone to court			1
they honestly thought they were going to win			2
they gave evidence the car went through the bollard at 10am but their @entity24 evidence proved us right			1
