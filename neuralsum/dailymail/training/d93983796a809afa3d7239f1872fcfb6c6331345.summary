by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:33 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 12:37 est , 15 january 2014 keeping history alive : @entity4 , @entity5 currently has a law that mandates that a certain number of new streets be named after @entity10 generals given the town 's involvement in the @entity13 a city just 15 minutes ’ drive away from @entity15 is now considering a repeal of an old law that requires a certain number of new streets to be named for long - dead @entity10 generals			1
@entity4 in @entity5 , just across the @entity20 from the nation ’s capital , is steeped in history but some local politicians are hoping to prevent some new reminders of the @entity13			1
city councilman @entity26 introduced legislation for tuesday night 's council meeting to do away with a 1963 law requiring that any new ' streets running in a generally north - south direction shall , insofar as possible , bear the names of confederate military leaders			1
' @entity26 's bill also would eliminate a requirement that new east - west streets be named for persons or places prominent in @entity40 history			1
@entity26 said he wants to remove a series of anachronistic laws , and his proposal also would repeal a ban on ' lewd cohabitation ' and laws regulating a bygone fad of ' rebound tumbling , ' a form of trampolining			0
as a practical matter , there is little likelihood that the city will be naming new streets any time soon			0
the city , inside @entity15 's @entity56 and separated from the nation 's capital by the @entity20 , is essentially built out			1
in fact , the street grid of the city 's @entity61 section dates to colonial times			0
@entity26 said that symbolically , he believes it 's a good thing to strip from the code a provision that in some ways glorifies the @entity10			2
staying the same : while @entity4 ( pictured ) is steeped in history , the greater area of @entity4 is continuing to expand as many people live in the area and commute to @entity15 as it is just minutes away very close : @entity4 was largely occupied by @entity74 troops during the @entity13 , which comes as little surprise given it 's proximity to the national capital that said , he made clear he is not proposing that the city change existing street names , some of which honor @entity10 gen. @entity83 , @entity10 president @entity84 and @entity86 @entity85 , whose @entity88 decision denied citizenship and constitutional protections to blacks before the @entity13			1
' i think we struggle in the city with our history , ' @entity26 said			0
@entity4 was occupied by @entity74 troops for most of the @entity13 and , like the rest of @entity5 , has a history of slavery and segregation			1
it is now a liberal bastion in @entity5 - @entity102 won 71 per cent of the vote in 2012			2
on historic @entity104 in @entity61 , the building that was once home to the nation 's largest domestic slave trading company is now home to the @entity109 , which operates the @entity110 there to tell the story of the slave trade			0
trading on it 's name : historical re-enactments are big tourist draws in the area , explaining why some are fighting against the measure @entity120 , president and ceo of the @entity109 , said she personally supports any legislation that keeps the city from unduly honoring the @entity10			2
still , while she is wary of glorifying the @entity10 , she said care must be taken remember unpleasant parts of @entity40 history			2
' some of my challenge in dealing with @entity110 is that people do n't want to remember ' that part of our history , she said			0
@entity26 said he has not heard of any opposition to his bill so far			0
officers with the @entity136 , which has occasionally protested when it sees efforts to scrub recognition of @entity10 leaders from the public square , did not return emails and phone calls seeking comment tuesday			1
a public hearing on @entity26 's legislation is scheduled for january 25 .			0

@entity4 , @entity5 may strike down an ' antiquated ' law that requires new streets to be named after @entity10 leaders
the northern @entity5 town is just miles from @entity15
