by @entity0 smell - o - vision has been a staple of bad sci - fi for decades , but could finally be edging closer to the average living room thanks to a super-accurate @entity6 system			2
a team from @entity8 in @entity6 have invented a ' smelling screen ' that makes smells waft from the spot on a display that their corresponding objects appear			1
the development promises to make adverts for fried chicken or fresh coffee even more appealing - or alternatively add an as yet undreamed of realism to documentary programmes like @entity20			0
smell - o - vision is real ! a team at @entity8 in @entity6 has invented a ' smelling screen ' that makes smells waft from the spot on a display that their corresponding objects appear smell - o - vision is nothing new , having been on the entertainment technology radar for over five decades			1
the idea made its first widespread appearance with the 1960 film @entity32 ( also known , less puntastically , as @entity32 ) , which timed odours to specific points in the narrative			2
the film opened in three specially equipped theatres in in @entity39 , @entity40 , and @entity41			0
unfortunately , the mechanism did not work properly and audience members complained of a hissing noise accompanying the scents - as well as a delay between the actions and their corresponding smells			0
as a result the film failed miserably , even after the mechanism was fixed			0
but perhaps it was just an idea whose time had not yet arrived - for the latest @entity6 technology seems to promise a new frontier in smell - related multimedia entertainment			2
the invention is ' a new olfactory display that can generate a localised odour distribution on a two - dimensional display screen , ' the researchers say			0
' the generated odour distribution is as if an odour source had been placed on the screen , and leads the user to perceive the odour as emanating from a specific region of the screen			2
' smell the secret recipe : the system could bring a whole new dimension to , for example , @entity75 adverts it works , @entity77 explains , by feeding odours from gel pellets into four air streams situated in each corner of the screen which are blown across the displays surface			1
varying the strength and direction of the air - streams using fans moves the scent to any particular spot on the screen , giving the illusion that it is emanating from the digital object displayed			1
' the user can freely move his / her head to sniff at various locations on the screen , and can experience realistic changes in the odour intensity with respect to the sniffing location , ' the researchers added in a statement			0
at the moment the system can only make one smell at a time , but the researchers say the next stage is to include a cartridge like those used in printers to allow the smells to be changed more easily			0
the technology was recently demonstrated the research at the @entity116 @entity115 in @entity117 , @entity118			1
@entity119 , who led the team that invented the ' smelling screen ' suggested that it could be used to enhance advertising hoardings and museum exhibits .			1

@entity126 team invent a ' smelling screen ' that makes smell emanate from the spot on the screen showing their corresponding object
it works by feeding odours from *sublimating* gel pellets into air streams that can be directed to specific spots on the screen
technology was recently *unveiled* at the @entity116 @entity115 in @entity117 , @entity118
