but @entity7 's workers ' @entity5 , 60 , and @entity8 , 63 , created a wedding fund with a twist when they spent 18 months collecting 40,000 loyalty points which paid for all the food when they tied the knot			1
the pair met whilst working in the supermarket using their @entity28 points they managed to put together a sumptuous buffet to feed all 140 of their guests			1
the @entity8 , from @entity33 , @entity34 , spent the £ 200 worth of points on a feast of sandwiches , quiches , sausage rolls and desserts			1
mr @entity8 said : ' the food went down very well			2
the points paid for everything food wise , the only extra thing we had to get was the gateau which @entity21 's did n't do			1
' they met working at the supermarket and a choir of their colleagues sang at the ceremony			2
the pair , who both still work at the shop , mainly collected in - store but also by paying their @entity57 bill online			2
normally two @entity28 points are awarded per £ 1 spent			2
they believe they spent roughly £ 200 a month on food shopping and bought ' everything ' , including mrs @entity64 honeymoon wardrobe , in the shop			1
mr @entity8 said : ' we definitely did n't spend £ 20,000 getting the points - we work at @entity21 's and do n't spend that much in a year			1
it would be less than half , probably a quarter , of that			0
' @entity5 and @entity8 , pictured in a less traditional type of aisle on their big day , used the points to pay for their wedding buffet mrs @entity64 added : ' if we went through the tills and were given a voucher that says you get a thousand points to buy this product then we would actually go out of our way to get that product			1
' deli worker @entity64 , nee @entity84 , added : ' it would have been really tight without the points			0
' our big day could not have been more perfect - it was more than i could ever have imagined			0
' her colleagues on the counters made the food and her boss even made their wedding cake as a gift			0
one of the customers got mrs @entity64 to the registry office on time after volunteering to be chauffeur when she heard they were having problems getting a driver			0
mrs @entity64 said : ' she is one of @entity21 's valued customers and we do like to get personal			1
' the faithful workers even matched the flowers , buttonhole and mr @entity8 ' tie to the colour of the @entity28 card the pair married in a registry office , but took a quick detour to the store where they work for some quirky wedding pictures the blushing bride raised a toast to the @entity28 cards after their loyalty points , collected over a year and a half , paid to feed their 140 guests the couple , who have both been married before and have 10 grandchildren between them , exchanged their vows at @entity33 registry office			1
the reception was held at @entity129 football stadium			0
mr @entity8 , who works in the fresh food department , said : ' we decided to pool all our @entity28 points and use them for the wedding			1
' in 18 months we did n’t spend a single @entity28 point and always bought products which could earn you extra points because of an offer			0
we could n’t have done it without them			0
' after their eyes met over the aisles the @entity144 got together in 2010 and mr @entity8 proposed on @entity145 last year			2
he said : ' i was @entity5 's immediate supervisor , that is were we first met			2
' mrs @entity64 said : ' he used to be my boss '			0
but her new husband quipped : ' now it is the other way around			0

@entity5 and @entity8 met whilst working at the @entity21 's store
their wedding was ' perfect ' and they ' could n't have done it ' without points
they spent thousands to get the points which were worth £ 200
