big - time boxing will make a welcome return to terrestrial television when @entity3 broadcast @entity5 ’s defence of his world title in @entity7 on february 28			1
the hard old game has been striving for a way to reclaim its huge free - to - air box office appeal for five years			0
there has been a strong feeling that a powerful renaissance of the sport has been failing to capitalise on the massive cross-over audience available on terrestrial network television			0
@entity30 ( @entity25 , 1985 ) @entity32 ’s defeat of reigning @entity34 featherweight champion @entity33 drew 18m viewers			0
@entity36 ( @entity3 , 1993 ) after @entity37 beat @entity38 three years earlier , 16.3m watched the rematch end in a draw			2
@entity3 are answering that call by screening @entity5 ’s @entity43 super bantamweight championship battle with mandatory challenger @entity22 at what will be a wildly atmospheric @entity23 in @entity7			1
the @entity45 ’s legendary mentor , manager and promoter @entity32 said when making the @entity3 announcement : ‘ this is as crucial for boxing as it is important for @entity5			1
‘ this is a great showcase for @entity5 to show the whole of @entity53 and much of the world what an exciting fighter he is			2
but on top of that our sport has been needing major exposure on terrestrial television			0
’ this will be the first world championship fight on one of the major networks since @entity66 beat @entity67 for the super middleweight title seven years ago			1
@entity5 beat @entity69 in @entity7 in september to win the @entity43 super bantamweight title @entity5 's mentor and manager @entity32 said that this is crucial for boxing and important for @entity5 the last live terrestrial broadcast featured @entity76 ’s non-title bout against @entity77 in @entity78 in 2010			1
@entity3 executive @entity79 said : ‘ this is a first step back into boxing for us and it is very exciting			0
it used to be that fighters were built up on terrestrial television before going on to pay - per - view with the likes of @entity87			0
‘ but lately the wider public have been deprived of the chance of seeing brilliant youngsters like @entity5			0
’ @entity66 's victory over @entity67 in december 2008 was the last world title bout on terrestrial tv @entity76 beat @entity77 at @entity94 in @entity78 in may 2010 live on @entity3 @entity3 ’s re-entry into the prize ring may push back plans for a title - unifying @entity98 between @entity5 and @entity100 , who is committed to @entity87 through his promoter @entity101			1
however , assuming he sees off @entity22 as expected , @entity5 will be looking first at other huge multi-belt duels with @entity103 and @entity104 , the brilliant @entity105 who is generally regarded as the @entity106 of the super bantamweight division			1
for a fight against @entity104 , for example , it is not inconceivable that @entity32 , now as shrewd in his negotiating as he was when a world champion in his own right , can pull together a multi-channel deal like those being discussed by @entity117 networks @entity118 and @entity119 for @entity106 vs @entity120			0
the undercard in @entity7 will be aired on @entity122 , followed by @entity123 on the main @entity3 channel .			2

@entity5 to fight @entity22 in @entity7 on february 28
super bantamweight world title *showdown* will be shown live on @entity3
fight will be first world championship duel on terrestrial tv in seven years
