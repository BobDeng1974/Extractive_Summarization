by @entity0 , on @entity1 in @entity2 published : 17:22 est , 14 october 2012 updated : 03:32 est , 15 october 2012 proudly clutching the @entity8 flag , the crew of the @entity5 scallop dredger @entity6 stand firm in the face of the sabre - rattling @entity10			1
militant @entity10 fishermen have threatened to mobilise a 250 - strong armada against @entity5 boats legally fishing for scallops off the @entity17 coast			1
they have already attacked the @entity6 and other @entity5 boats with rocks , iron bars and flares in what the crew have called ‘ @entity24 ’			1
speaking from the wheel cabin of his 100ft boat he said : ‘ these boys are hardened seafarers and there is nothing more they would like than a punch - up with the @entity10			1
‘ but i told them we must not retaliate whatever they might throw at us			0
that ’s just what the @entity10 want			1
they are trying to goad us into fighting back and making us like the bad guys in this			0
‘ we have been fishing for scallops here for years and there is plenty to go round for all of us , they just want it all for themselves			0
‘ we have painted a @entity67 on the side of the boat to show we will not be intimidated			0
’ not scared : from left to right , @entity70 , @entity33 , @entity34 , skipper @entity32 , @entity31 , @entity41 and @entity30 as the @entity6 rocks from side to side in the rough waters of the @entity76 it is difficult to see what stirs up such emotion			1
but when the huge mechanical arms at each side of the dredger haul up 14 steel scoops packed with scallops the bounty is there to see			0
' these boys are hardened seafarers and there is nothing more they would like than a punch - up with the @entity10 ' @entity32 , 47 , @entity6 skipper this is what the @entity10 fishermen are willing to ram rivals boats for , and even throw ropes into their propellers			1
a self - imposed summer ban means the @entity10 do n’t fish for scallops until october 1			1
when they returned to the waters they were angry to see how much the @entity5 boats had harvested			2
armed with rocks and iron bars they left the beaches of the d - day landings determined to confront the @entity5 boats			1
@entity6 crew member @entity30 , 24 , said : ‘ they came armed with basketfuls of rocks			1
the skipper told us not to hit back			0
he said that is exactly what they want but in the end we had to go into the wheelhouse with the skipper because it was the only place that was safe			0
’ @entity34 , 25 , said : ‘ the job is hard enough as it is			0
we are all exhausted trying to make a living but we are determined to stand firm			0
’ in charge : skipper @entity32 , 47 , ( pictured ) says his crew refuse to be intimidated by their @entity44 foes the @entity129 fishermen have a long track record of using force to get their own way			1
ten years ago they believed a @entity5 boat called the @entity134 was poaching scallops in @entity10 waters			1
up to 100 @entity10 fishing boats confronted the @entity134 and a steel cable was thrown into its propellers			2
' the job is hard enough as it is			0
we are all exhausted trying to make a living but we are determined to stand firm ' @entity34 , 25 , @entity6 crew member in last week ’s confrontation @entity10 fishermen also attempted to snag the propellers of the @entity6			1
the evidence – a long blue rope – is displayed on deck			0
that attack lasted for six hours and ended only with the arrival of a @entity153 cutter			0
however , it cruised past the @entity10 to stop amongst the nine @entity5 boats to take down their details			1
the next day it returned and boarded the @entity5 boats to check their papers and that their catch was not oversized and was legal			2
the following day another @entity153 vessel did the same			0
mr @entity32 , who has 20 years at sea , said : ‘ it ’s victimisation			2
they want to do whatever they can to find faults with us and kick us out			0
’ hard as nails : crew pictured from left to right : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity33 , @entity41 , @entity34 , first mate @entity37 and skipper @entity32 the @entity10 raid began in the early hours of monday			1
first mate @entity37 , 27 , said : ‘ it ’s astonishing there was no loss of life			0
they were firing flares on to one boat , which could easily start a fire			0
' the @entity10 are being greedy and they want everything to themselves			2
we wo n't let them win ' @entity32 , 47 , @entity6 skipper ‘ the worst thing was , the @entity5 did n’t do anything about it despite our calls for help			1
we were just left to our own devices			0
we did n’t stand a chance against so many @entity10 trawlers , especially when they are backed up by the @entity153			2
’ @entity5 fishing boats are not allowed within 12 miles of the @entity10 coast but the @entity6 and other @entity5 boats have not breached that line			1
new quotas mean @entity5 boats can fish for scallops for only 36 days in october , november and december , including travelling time , bad weather breaks and mechanical failure			2
mr @entity32 said : ‘ it means we have to make the most of the hours we have			2
the @entity10 are being greedy and they want everything to themselves			2
we wo n’t let them win			0

@entity10 fishermen have threatened a 250 - strong armada against @entity5
already attacked the @entity6 and others with rocks , iron bars and flares
skipper @entity32 says his crew would love a ' punch - up with the @entity10 '
