@entity0 regrets ' not telling the @entity2 public more ' about the removal of @entity4 as prime minister the former treasurer believes the failure to convince @entity4 to contest the first ballot after he was removed in 2010 was the party 's downfall mr @entity0 said @entity11 should have been ' more open ' about why the party dumped @entity4 which would have removed him as a destabilising force within the government @entity0 says it 's unlikely they 'll bury the hatchet over a quiet drink because @entity4 ' is not a couple of beers kind of guy ' mr @entity0 claims @entity22 was ' the better politician ' not just the best pm and @entity24 can lead the party to victory over @entity27 by @entity28 for @entity29 for @entity0 the bitterness still runs deep			1
the former treasurer , now sitting on @entity11 's backbench and in the middle of promoting his new book ' @entity35 ' on his time in government , said if there was one regret from those turbulent six years of the @entity42 governments , it was not putting an end to the @entity4 threat once and for all in 2010 by way of a party room ballot			1
mr @entity0 believes if he and his @entity11 colleagues had been able to convince @entity4 to contest the leadership within the party room , a heavy loss would have humiliated the then @entity23 and saved the @entity11 government from three subsequent years of turmoil			1
he 's convinced a heavy defeat would have stopped the ousted @entity23 having any influence on @entity22 's leadership the former @entity31 told @entity29 today that ' in retrospect we should have dealt with @entity4 through his running for the leadership ( against @entity22 ) in 2010 '			2
' i regret not telling the @entity2 public more , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' we should have been more forthright ( publicly ) as to the reasons why it all came about and then had a vote about it , rather than leaving it and let it sit , ' mr @entity0 said			2
the resentment over @entity4 's sniping and destabilising of the @entity22 leadership clearly still festers inside @entity0			1
when mention was made of their friendship coming through the @entity11 ranks and @entity4 being @entity74 to his son , the member for @entity76 in @entity77 was quick to interrupt and say : ' but that was a long time ago remember , well before i became a minister '			0
the end of the road			0
@entity22 and @entity0 leave the leadership ballot in 2013 when the then @entity23 was defeated by @entity4 as for letting bygones be bygones , mr @entity0 said he was n't expecting a call from the ex-pm any time soon			1
' i 'm not holding any ongoing grudge but he 's not the let 's have a couple of beers kind of guy anyway			2
' in his book ' @entity35 ' , mr @entity0 says @entity4 's ' prime ministership was not built to last '			1
' its shelf life , being built on celebrity , as it was , was likely quite short unless he changed			0
‘ @entity4 ’s treatment of people was extraordinarily vindictive and juvenile			0
and it was frequently on display			0
’ @entity0 says he 's not waiting for a phone call from @entity4 ' i do n't think he 's a couple of beers kind of guy ' he writes in the book that ' @entity4 had left no stone unturned in wreaking his revenge on @entity22 and the government '			1
mr @entity0 said his biggest acts of treachery was during the @entity108 he added ' all of his subsequent treachery pales into insignificance compared to what he and his agents did in the 2010 election campaign '			2
mr @entity0 said of allegations mr @entity4 was the source of leaks from strategy room discussions as being ' an act of treachery worthy only of someone of the standing of @entity122 as a @entity11 rat '			1
@entity0 launches ' @entity35 ' , in which he accuses @entity4 of ' an act of treachery worthy only of someone of the standing of @entity122 as a @entity11 rat '			2
just as quick , his response to the question , with hindsight , as to which of the two @entity129 he served was the better politician			0
' i 'd vote for @entity22 , unquestionably and i do n't say that with any recall , ' he added			0
@entity22 is ' unquestionably the better politician ' when compared with @entity4 , says @entity0 as for current leader @entity24 , @entity0 has given his seal of approval			1
' what he did yesterday was courageous , it was the right thing to do			0
that 's the sort of thing leadership is made of , ' he said in reference to the @entity11 leader going public on @entity142 investigations clearing him of rape allegations			0
and as for @entity11 returning to power at the next election , under @entity24			0
' too right , i 'm very optimistic and you would n't have made that judgement six months ago			0
