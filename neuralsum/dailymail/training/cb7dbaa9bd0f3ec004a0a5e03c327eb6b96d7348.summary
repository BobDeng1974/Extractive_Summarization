’ he said it was people from @entity3 who helped to ‘ recover ’ @entity87 's humanity			2
speaking on a visit where he was granted the @entity89 , he added : ‘ i hope you do not miss the opportunity [ of immigration ]			2
‘ opposing it would be just for short - term returns			0
people are worried , rightly of course , about economics but in the end those who do not share end up not actually enriched			0
they are certainly going to be impoverished in their humanity			0
’ the former archbishop of @entity101 spoke about the ‘ how welcoming and affirming people ’ were for him and his wife when they first came to @entity3 in 1962			2
