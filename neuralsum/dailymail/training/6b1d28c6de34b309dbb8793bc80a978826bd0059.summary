but that looks more likely to happen at @entity14 ’s @entity13 meeting in october than in the @entity15 at @entity16 next month			1
breaking clear : @entity17 riding @entity1 storms ahead at @entity9 on saturday champion : @entity1 wins the @entity21 super sprint in the @entity22 at @entity9 @entity1 ’s @entity16 target now looks like being the @entity24			1

if we are going to pitch her into that sort of stuff it will be better at the end of the year			2
she could get soft ground there which she will love			0
’ @entity5 ’s @entity35 ( @entity17 ) was a half - length win of yesterday ’s @entity37 at @entity38 from @entity40 - trained @entity39			1

@entity53 ’s @entity70 winner @entity69 is not certain to take on @entity71 in the @entity72 a week on wednesday – he has the @entity73 as an alternative - but definitely heading to @entity75 is @entity78 ’s 2012 @entity77 winner @entity76			2
