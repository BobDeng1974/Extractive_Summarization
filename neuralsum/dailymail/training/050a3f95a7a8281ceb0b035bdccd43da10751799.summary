by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent a leading charity was forced to apologise yesterday for nuisance calls hounding vulnerable and elderly people for donations			2
in one shocking example , a woman with a terminally ill daughter asked a firm making calls on behalf of the @entity11 to stop phoning her , but it refused to take her off its list			1
in another , a manager at @entity15 who was told that a woman with depression did not want to be called replied that the illness was not ‘ a get - out - of - jail card ’			1
the apology came after an investigation of telephone charity fundraisers by @entity34 ’s dispatches programme			1
it put undercover researchers into two firms , @entity15 in @entity38 and @entity39 and @entity40 in @entity41 , which are contracted by charities including the @entity11 , the @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 ’s			2
a researcher working at @entity15 on a campaign for the hospital was told by a woman who said she had a terminally ill daughter that she did not want to ‘ talk about it ’			1
the researcher listed her as a ‘ hard refusal ’ who should not be called again , but a manager said : ‘ we do n’t want to do it as a hard refusal because she has n’t said she does n’t want calls			2
if you get my point ? ‘ she has n’t said “ do n’t call me ” – she has just said she does n’t want to talk about it ; soft refusal			0
as much as it feels bad and unethical , it is a soft refusal			0
’ the woman ’s name was listed to be called again			0
' shocked ' : @entity11 said it was ' shocked and deeply distressed to hear of the evidence of unacceptable behaviour ' , and would be investigating the methods used by telephone fundraisers dispatches said scripts given to call centre staff ask them to make three requests for money to everyone they speak to			1
at @entity15 , this applied even when a woman said she was too depressed to talk			2
a manager told an undercover researcher that ‘ being depressed is not really a get - out - of - jail card ’			1
@entity11 said : ‘ we were shocked and deeply distressed to hear of the evidence of unacceptable behaviour and ways of working presented in this report and we would like to apologise to anyone affected			1
’ at @entity91 and @entity40 , a researcher was given a script in a campaign for @entity43 that she believed asked her to claim she was calling directly from the charity			0
she was told ‘ we are in that way like the voice of the @entity43 ’ , although the script contained a statement that the call was being made by @entity91 and @entity40 and the firm was being paid			2
the @entity43 said : ‘ our fundraising activity fully meets the very high standards we set ourselves			0
’ professor @entity103 , a former director of the @entity104 , which promotes the industry code of practice followed by the firms involved , said a review was needed , ‘ not only of the agencies but also of the way in which fundraisers are managing these relationships ’			0
@entity15 told the @entity72 programme , to be broadcast tonight : ‘ we train and monitor our staff rigorously			1
complaints about our calls are extremely rare : the 1.25million calls we made last year generated fewer than 100 complaints			0
we are constantly striving to improve			0
’ @entity91 and @entity40 said : ‘ scripts are written in association with our partner charities in line with legal requirements and best practice guidelines			0
