@entity0 last night urged @entity2 voters to ' swing behind the @entity4 ' to avoid the ' nightmare ' of a ' backward - looking @entity7 government ' propped up by an ' even more left - wing ' @entity8			1
the @entity11 mayor claimed @entity2 supporters are in ' increasing psychological conflict ' as they realise a vote for @entity16 's party is a ' vote for @entity18 '			1
' a lot want to come home to the @entity21			0
any gain by @entity2 is a gain by @entity18 , ' he told the @entity24 as he campaigned in the @entity25 , the @entity27 seat where mr @entity16 is standing			1
' the risk is that would let in a @entity7 / @entity8 government which would be a catastrophe for the country '			1
mr @entity0 's intervention signals that the @entity21 are determined to ramp up their warnings over a minority @entity7 government dependent on the votes of @entity8 mps			1
yesterday , former prime minister sir @entity63 clashed with @entity65 's first minister @entity64 over the prospect of the surging @entity67 , on course to win 40 or more seats , holding the balance of power at @entity71			0
miss @entity64 has ruled out any deal with the conservatives and said she would be prepared to put mr @entity18 in @entity74 even if @entity7 wins fewer seats in a hung @entity76			1
in an unusual intervention in contemporary politics , sir @entity63 warned the @entity8 represents a ' real and present danger ' to the future of the @entity82			2
a partnership between @entity7 and the @entity8 would mean mr @entity18 being subjected to ' a daily dose of political blackmail ' from an @entity8 determined to ' create merry hell ' in order to bring about the end of the @entity89 , he said			1
his remarks drew a furious response from @entity92 , who said his remarks about her party being a threat were ' an affront to democracy '			0
mr @entity0 leaves a walkabout in @entity44 , @entity27 , with lipstick on his cheek ' these are the same politicians that during the referendum campaign urged @entity65 to lead the @entity82 not leave the @entity82			1
now they appear to say @entity65 's voice should only be heard if we say the things they want us to say and vote the way they want us to vote , ' she said			0
' my message to @entity63 is @entity65 's voice deserves to be heard in whatever way the @entity65 people choose , and voting @entity8 means @entity65 's voice will be heard more loudly and strongly at @entity71 than it has ever been heard before			2
' former first minister @entity117 insisted sir @entity63 's position was ' fundamentally undemocratic '			0
he said he was ' the man who , let us remember , rather carelessly mislaid every single @entity4 seat in @entity65 '			2
' what these @entity71 parties fear - and what many people in @entity124 would welcome - is not just the size of the @entity8 , but the majority for progressive politics that would come from it , ' he said mr @entity18 , who has repeatedly refused to rule out relying on the support of the @entity8 to get into @entity131 , also reacted angrily			1
' @entity132 is setting one part of part of the @entity82 against another			0
he is talking up the @entity8 chances and not taking them on			2
that is dangerous , ' the @entity7 leader said			2
' i have to say to conservatives , frankly , i think they should tell the prime minister to stop because he is demeaning his office , he is demeaning himself , he is demeaning those people he sends out on his behalf , and frankly , i think it is threatening the integrity of the @entity82			0
' even one former @entity4 cabinet minister expressed unease , claiming the party 's campaign attacks on the @entity8 risk undermining the future of the @entity82			1
former @entity65 secretary @entity155 said talking up the threat posed by the @entity65 nationalists was ' short - term and dangerous '			0
the prime minister was unrepentant last night , rejecting the suggestion he risks stoking @entity8 support in @entity65			2
@entity8 leader @entity64 was mocked by @entity161 sir @entity63 over her demand to play a role in propping up a @entity7 government mr @entity18 yesterday claimed @entity132 was ' setting up one part of the @entity82 against another ' ' i am responsible for lots of things			1
@entity169 , i am the prime minister , i am responsible for everything			0
but i am not responsible for the fact that the @entity7 has failed to get its message across in @entity65			0
' the rest of the country does have to wonder , what is the price that they will pay ? i fear for our country if this were to happen			0
' mr @entity132 said the @entity8 would want voters across the @entity82 to feel by the end of five years of chaotic administration that ' the country does n't work , that the government does not work , that the country should break up '			1
campaigning in @entity187 , @entity188 , he added : ' by raising this i am not only raising the issue and the fear that people have that money will be sucked out of areas like this			0
' i am also raising the point that we care about our @entity82 , i care passionately about it			0
do n't let the @entity8 into government of the @entity82 because they would try to break it up			0
' mr @entity0 , campaigning in @entity25 , said : ' @entity2 voters can see the argument that we have got the plan for the economy , and i hope very much that they will think sensibly and carefully			1
' there is an element of internal conflict in the minds of many @entity2 voters			0
they are thinking they could end up with something – a backward - looking @entity7 government propped up by an even more left - wing @entity8 – that would really set the country back			1
' mr @entity132 has repeatedly warned against allowing the @entity8 into government for fear they will ' try to break it up '			2

@entity11 mayor @entity0 has urged @entity2 supporters to vote @entity4
he said @entity2 supporters realise a vote for @entity2 is a ' vote for @entity18 '
conservative votes would avoid the ' nightmare ' of @entity8 propping up @entity7
mr @entity0 yesterday campaigned in @entity27 , where @entity16 is standing
