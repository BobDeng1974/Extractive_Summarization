read our original article about the fairytale story here after an incredible year that saw the tiny @entity7 club of @entity8 promoted into @entity9 , this should be one of the season of honorary president @entity12 's life			1
but the dream is now over for the former @entity15 goalkeeper			0

@entity12 says the ' story ends here			1
' honorary president @entity12 met with the @entity27 regarding @entity8 the tiny @entity7 side were denied access into @entity9 because of their stadium size , with a 400 capacity the @entity8 players celebrate what they thought was promotion from the @entity28 last season where the tiny village of @entity8 is in @entity7 the village of @entity41 contains just 650 inhabitants , and is tucked away in the @entity43 in @entity7			1
@entity12 , who was born just 30km away in @entity44 was handed his role in 2012 , a year after @entity46 bought the club with the intention of bringing success to the region			1
it did n't take long			0
the @entity52 deemed their original stadium of the @entity56 de @entity54 to be too small , with just one stand holding around 400 supporters , so their wild celebrations upon achieving promotion in april took place at the @entity62 in @entity63 , 20km from home			1
@entity65 stormed through the @entity28 with the help of @entity68 striker @entity67 , top scorer in the division with 21 goals ; manager @entity71 was on the verge of greatness , a step away from one of the top five divisions in @entity18			1
though the possibility of denial into the league above lingered , pre-season did n't start too badly			0
a draw with local rivals @entity82 , a mainstay in @entity84 , gave fans hope that they could not only compete , but excel in @entity9			2
but now , it is all over			0
the @entity88 project , that is			0
@entity12 was named honorary president at the club in 2012 and was born just 30km away from the village the beautiful region in the @entity41 where it is based , with a population of approximately 400 ' the refusal to accept @entity65 into the @entity28 brings an end to our project , ' @entity12 is quoted as saying in get @entity7 football			1
' we can not accept residing in @entity101 ( 5th division ) with players who had earned their place in @entity9			2
' we were given no promises of an automatic rise next season either			0
for us , @entity46 and me , it 's over , the story ends here			0
' @entity12 and @entity46 met with the @entity27 on wednesday but they could n't find an agreement to reinstate the club back into a professional league			1
all players who did their utmost to achieve their great feat will be released from their contracts , with their second team now set to step to the fore down in the amateur seventh division			0
@entity12 made it his duty to pick the new signings , and he did so with pinpoint accuracy			2
he attracted @entity84 and @entity9 outcasts desperate for a new adventure who would find it hard saying no to a @entity130 winner			2
youngsters train at the @entity56 de @entity54 , which will now host the seventh division games this season one of those men was @entity136 , 35 , a man who had played 157 games for @entity82			0
even a man with such experience could n't believe what was going on			0
' who would have thought that five months after our promotion to @entity9 , we 'd be saying goodbye to each other in a car park ? ' lamented @entity136 to @entity146			1
' i feel a lot of sadness about what 's been done over recent years			0
' they 're sending us to @entity152 ( division d'honneur regionale ) with a great kick up the bum			0
in two weeks , we 'll no longer speak about @entity65			2
' the players , like many people in @entity7 , will go down to the dole office			2
' many will say that a village of this size with a stadium of this size are back to where they belong			1
but @entity65 had earned it			2
@entity12 had earned it .			0
