by @entity0 when it comes to creating stylish designs @entity2 hairdresser @entity1 is quite literally hot stuff			1
the traditional barber is one of the last still practicing the ancient art of @entity10 hairdressing , which involves using a pair of red hot metal clamps to burn hair off rather than cut it			1
if the hair is too long , the clamps are used like a pair of scissors to cut it to the desired length and then the expert slides the burning hot metal over the rest of the hair to create a perm which he claims lasts up to three months			2
now hardly anybody wants a haircut using the unusual method			2
mr @entity1 , 73 , said : ' it 's not just a shortage of hairdressers offering the method , there are also not very many customers that are interested in it any more			1
it is mainly older people that come to my shop nowadays			0
and like me one day they wo n't be here any more either			0
' for the moment , however , business is going well at his shop in @entity63 , @entity64 in @entity66 province , southwest @entity2			0
he said : ' my customers agree with me that hair done in this way can keep the same shape for 3 months			2
' business : mr @entity1 says business is going well at his shop in @entity63 , @entity64 in @entity66 province , southwest @entity2 method : hairdressers slide the burning hot metal over the rest of the hair to create a perm which mr @entity1 ( pictured left ) claims lasts up to three months rare : mr @entity1 said his store ( pictured ) is one of the only ones left in @entity2 offering the traditional style of haircutting the metal clamp is left in a wooden fire until it is red hot , then cooled slightly with water before it is used on the hair for the first time			1
clients then have their hair washed before the clamp is used a second time to shape it			0
mr @entity1 said the only drawback is that some people do n't like the smell of burning hair but most of his clients do n't think it is an issue			1
' my business is quite good			0
cooling down : the metal clamps are cooled slightly before they are used to cut hair			0
