the 2013/14 season was seen as a step forward for @entity2 , spending the majority of the campaign at the top of the @entity6 and ending their trophy drought with the @entity9			1
but the @entity10 still finished in fourth place yet again , with @entity13 's team were heavily criticised after throwing away the title			0
that poor run of form in 2014 could n't seem further away now with @entity2 flying in the league , a recent 4 - 1 victory against @entity19 demonstrating their step forward			0
but still , the north @entity22 side have exactly the same record as they did at this stage last season			0
@entity2 were reeling after a 6 - 0 defeat by @entity27 at this stage last season and had 63 points from 31 games the @entity10 are now in fine form and beat @entity19 4 - 1 on saturday but still have the exact same record the @entity6 table after @entity2 had played 31 games in 2013/14 ( left ) , and now ( right ) played 31 , won 19 , drawn six , lost six - the only stat differentiating the two tables is @entity2 's favourable goal difference in this campaign - a season which their points tally of 63 merits a place of second , rather than fourth			1
with the addition of @entity44 as well as a new - found solidity in @entity46 and the goalscoring returns of @entity48 and @entity49 , the @entity10 are already being tipped to challenge for the title next season			2
but the run of form at the start of the season - in contrast to 2013/14 when they impressed in the opening months - has cost @entity13			2
defeats by @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 will be looked back on with regret by this @entity2 team , as well as dropping points late on at @entity19 and @entity65			1
@entity66 celebrates after equalising in @entity2 's 31st game last season against @entity70 the @entity10 were in fine form at the beginning of the 2013/14 season and topped the table for many weeks they currently top the @entity76 form guide but still ca n't beat their efforts from last year , at this stage at least			1
wind back a year and @entity2 were reeling from a 6 - 0 defeat by @entity27 , drawing with @entity59 and @entity70 before another humiliating loss at the hands of @entity82			0
things are certainly on the up for the @entity10 now and they do look in fine shape heading into the summer , but they should not forget what could have been , this season and last			0
@entity13 will regret many results in this season - including a 3 - 2 defeat by @entity60 in december			2

@entity2 were title *contenders* in 2013/14 season before *faltering* at the end
*gunners* have same record after 31 games : won 19 , drawn six , lost six
@entity13 *insists* @entity2 have *improved* with likes of @entity44
@entity2 started this season poorly with defeats at @entity59 and @entity60
