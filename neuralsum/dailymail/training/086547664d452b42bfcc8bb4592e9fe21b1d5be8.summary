by @entity1 reporter a master double agent famous for escaping the @entity4 to @entity5 may have been encouraged to defect by a fellow spy , it has emerged			0
in a letter from the @entity8 to a lifelong friend who he betrayed , @entity9 - one of the infamous @entity13 - suggested @entity12 figures wanted to wash their hands of him			1
published for the first time today in @entity18 , the letter was written by @entity9 to his colleague @entity19 soon after he was able to flee to a new life in @entity21 despite being accused of treachery in @entity23			1
traitor : @entity13 member @entity9 , pictured in @entity21 , sent a letter to a friend he had betrayed suggesting he had been encouraged to leave @entity27 for the @entity8 defector : @entity9 , who died in 1988 , pictured in @entity5 with his fourth wife @entity29 it used the spy slang for defection - ' do me a fade ' - to suggest @entity19 had encouraged him to defect to @entity5			1
' @entity35 , ' he wrote			0

spying for @entity5 : @entity9 escaped detection for 12 years after two co-conspirators fled @entity27 ' they did much to help one get one 's bearings in this complicated world ! i deeply appreciate , now as ever , our old friendship , and i hope that rumours which have reached me about your having had some trouble on my account , are exaggerated			1
' the letter was uncovered by the journalist and historian @entity57 as he researched a new book , a @entity60			2
serialised in the @entity18 , the account describes how @entity9 abused his friendship with @entity19 , with whom he had risen through the @entity12 , passing information to the @entity64 which led to the deaths of some of @entity19 's contacts			1
according to the @entity18 , the extraordinary letter asked @entity19 to meet him in @entity69 - and he wanted to go so he could exact revenge on his treacherous friend , who had destroyed his career			1
instead he eventually replied with the words : ' put some flowers for me on poor @entity77 's grave ' , a reference to would - be defector @entity77 who was outed through @entity9 's betrayal			2
in a secret service steeped in the paranoia of the @entity82 , the ' @entity13 ' escaped detection for many years , rising to the highest levels of the @entity12			1
the scandal rocked the @entity4 by revealing @entity5 double agents at the heart of many of @entity27 's most storied institutions			0
@entity9 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 all met at the @entity93 , where @entity92 was an academic and the other three were undergraduates			0
the older man recruited the students to the @entity5 cause before the @entity98 - and they remained devoted to the @entity8 even after the start of the @entity82			2
@entity9 was head of counter-intelligence for @entity12 , @entity91 was a @entity101 official and @entity90 worked for the @entity102			0
@entity92 was the most eminent of all , as director of the @entity105 and keeper of the royal family 's art collection			0
@entity13 : @entity92 ( left , 1907 - 1983 ) was the director of the @entity105 and kept the royal family 's art collection while @entity91 ( right , 1913 - 1983 ) was a foreign office official who fled in 1951 @entity90 ( 1911 - 1963 ) , left , worked for the @entity102 while the fifth member was said to be @entity111 in 1951 , @entity90 and @entity91 were exposed as double agents - but after being tipped off by @entity9 , they were able to escape to @entity21			1
despite the suspicion surrounding @entity9 , he avoided detection for another 12 years until 1963 , when he too defected to the @entity8			1
it was claimed last week that @entity12 chiefs were so convinced @entity9 could not be a traitor because of his establishment background and trustworthiness that they shielded him from official probes			2
@entity92 escaped exposure for even longer			0
it was not until 1979 , when @entity122 named him as a suspect in the @entity124 , that he confessed to his treachery and was stripped of his titles			0
the ' fifth man ' in the spy ring has never been definitively identified , but was named as @entity111 by @entity130 defector @entity129			0
the story of the unlikely traitors has been dramatised several times , including in @entity135 's classic book @entity136 and the film of the same name			0
@entity139 : @entity140 starred in @entity141 , a fictionalisation of the @entity13 scandal based on the book by @entity135			2
