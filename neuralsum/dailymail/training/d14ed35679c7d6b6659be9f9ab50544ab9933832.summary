by @entity0 a toddler has a rare condition that makes his skin so dry he ca n't blink			1
@entity4 , who is 18 months - old , was born with lamellar ichthyosis - which affects just one in 600,000 people - and causes the skin to become thickened and cracked			1
the top layer of his skin sheds six times faster than normal - leaving a thick , scale - like build - up of skin underneath			2
@entity4 , 18 months old , has a rare , genetic condition which causes his skin to thicken and crack the top layer of @entity4 's skin sheds six times faster than normal - leaving a thick , scale - like build - up his parents @entity17 , 29 and @entity18 , 23 , have to smother him in medical jelly like @entity20 every four hours to stop his delicate skin from cracking			1
mr @entity4 , a recruiter from @entity22 , @entity23 , said : ‘ the skin is thick and it peels off and it takes about two months to completely come off			1
‘ over time he now has to be creamed every four to six hours each day and every three hours throughout the night			2
‘ it ’s a very high maintenance condition and he also requires two or three showers a day as well as eye drops because he does n’t blink			1
‘ he ’s been in and out of hospital with skin infections because of the condition			1
‘ it will continue throughout his life and there ’s no cure for it			2
when he is older he ’ll have to do it all himself			2
’ @entity4 's parents have to apply cream to his skin every four hours during the day and every three hours throughout the night			1
he is pictured with his mother , @entity18 there is no cure for @entity4 's condition so as he gets older he will have to learn to manage it himself			1
he is pictured with his father , @entity17 he added : ‘ @entity0 and i were just unlucky that we both had the gene			0
there is a one in four chance any children we have will get it			0
‘ as long as he ’s been brought up right and it ’s not an issue he will be alright			0
‘ it ’s one of those things , he ’s just a bit different			0
he ’s a very happy child and as long as we teach him to be confident about himself i do n’t see why he ca n’t lead a normal life			0
’ lamellar ichthyosis , which develops when a child inherits an abnormal gene from both parents , speeds up the skin cell turnover			2
the word ichthyosis comes from the ancient @entity66 word for fish - because the cracked skin is said to resemble the scales on a fish			0
@entity4 does not blink so he has to be given eye drops regularly so his eyes do n't dry out throughout his life , @entity4 has been in and out of hospital with skin infections			1
image ( right ) shows him in hospital being treated with a @entity20 - like jelly problems associated with the condition include overheating , where a person ’s thick skin prevents them from sweating , and eye problems caused by the tightness of the skin			1
some children get ‘ constriction bands ’ which mean they have tight bands of skin around their fingers or toes which can prevent proper blood circulation			0
severe scaling of the skin on the scalp can also lead to patchy loss of hair			0
@entity4 ’s parents are hoping to raise money for @entity102 , and have so far raised £ 2,900 towards the fight for a cure			1

lamellar ichthyosis is a very rare skin condition characterised by abnormal scaling and shedding of the skin			1
it is believed to occur in one in every 600,000 people and symptoms usually appear within the first few days of life			0
sufferers tend to have plate - like scales of skin which often appear brownish in colour			0
the condition is caused by genetic abnormalities that affect the shedding of skin			1
it occurs when both of a person 's parents carry the abnormal gene - in this situation , there is a one in four chance of the person developing the condition			0
lamellar ichthyosis can also cause overheating as it prevents sweating , and can constrict the blood flow to the fingers and toes as it causes the skin tighten			0
it can also cause eye problems , hair loss , and difficulty bending the hand joints			0
there is currently no cure and the key treatment is regularly applying moisturiser .			2
