like his team , he can do better than that			0
fortunately for @entity24 's coach , the conditions at @entity3 suit @entity21 and @entity22			1
these two could play on anything			0
@entity21 came on as substitute at half - time , replacing captain @entity29 and steering his team into the @entity31 quarter - finals with a beaut off his right boot			1
substitute @entity21 ( left ) slides in to give @entity24 the lead against @entity35 less than 10 minutes after coming off the bench @entity21 's effort squirms beyond @entity35 goalkeeper @entity38 ( left ) to give @entity24 the advantage in the second half @entity21 runs off to celebrate his strike against the @entity43 side with the home fans at @entity3 @entity45 ( centre ) and @entity47 ( right ) run to celebrate with goalscorer @entity21 in the 54th minute @entity24 : @entity48 ; @entity49 6.5 , @entity50 6 , @entity51 6 , @entity52 6 ; @entity45 6.5 , @entity53 5.5 ; @entity47 7 ( @entity54 81 ) , @entity22 6 ( @entity55 84 ) , @entity29 6 ( @entity21 46 , 7.5 ) ; @entity56 6 subs not used : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 goals : @entity21 54 , @entity22 74 booked : @entity50 manager : @entity6 7 @entity35 : @entity38 8.5 ; @entity64 6 , @entity65 6 , @entity66 7 , @entity67 6.5 ; @entity68 6.5 ; @entity69 6.5 , @entity70 6.5 ( @entity71 66 ) ; @entity72 7 ( @entity73 66 ) , @entity74 6.5 , @entity75 6.5 ( @entity76 88 ) subs not used : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 manager : @entity83 6.5 referee : @entity85 7 * match ratings by @entity87 at @entity3 boy did they need him to win this clash against a robust and resilient @entity35 team			1
@entity21 , he of @entity94 fame , is a class act , even if he did incur the wrath of his manager after emerging from a toilet cubicle just before the start of the second half			1
' i was angry because we knew @entity29 could n't continue so i wanted @entity21 on			1
after that he went to the toilet and he came out late			0
' he was standing upright when he danced into the penalty area , putting @entity24 ahead against their tricky , @entity43 opponents			2
@entity22 added another , following up his hat - trick here in last week 's @entity111 clash against @entity112			1

next they will face @entity130 , the team who beat them 2 - 1 here last sunday to prompt @entity6 's outburst about the size of the pitch here at @entity3			1
it is complete bunkum of course , an excuse for three defeats suffered by this @entity24 team in the @entity11 this season			2
instead they have the familiar @entity24 feel , a @entity31 team again as they limp past @entity146 and @entity35 in this competition and make headway in the @entity111			1
this is a nervy @entity24 team , living on edge after defeats here against @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity130			1
@entity24 striker @entity22 ( left ) stretches to beat @entity66 ( right ) to the ball and score his side 's second goal of the night academy product @entity22 shouts with delight as he celebrates making it 2 - 0 against @entity83 's @entity35 side @entity24 defender @entity161 ( left ) challenges @entity35 's @entity75 ( right ) for the ball during the first half they have some making up to do with the fans who have been waiting for this club to take off under @entity168 's stewardship for more than a decade			1
when this team has n't scored after five minutes you can sense the confidence seeping out of the side			2
soon it spreads into the stands and before you know it they are putting their knuckles in their mouths at half - time to stop themselves booing their team			2
it another close call here at 0 - 0			2
to listen to @entity35 's army of fans , the thousands who made it up from the south coast , chanting ' ole ' towards the end of the first half would have got on their goat			2

@entity22 claimed he had been thrown to the deck by @entity64 , who began wagging his finger in the striker 's face , and demanded a penalty			1

the @entity35 keeper , who is also in the @entity237 squad , was outstanding in the first half			0

@entity69 's dreamy effort , a free kick from 25 yards out , dipped over @entity48 's crossbar			0
it was only after the break when the tie moved in @entity24 's favour after @entity29 , nursing a hamstring injury , was replaced by @entity21			1
eight minutes into the second half he combined brilliantly with @entity56 , combing their way through the @entity35 defence to set up the opener			1
