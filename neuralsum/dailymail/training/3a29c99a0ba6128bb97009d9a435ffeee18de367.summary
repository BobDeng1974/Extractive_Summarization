a school inspector accused of ‘ inappropriate copying and pasting ’ in his reports has been dropped by @entity4			1
@entity5 produced identical or near - identical sections in his assessments of schools over three years while working as a lead inspector for @entity10 , a private contractor used by the education watchdog			1
but @entity4 said it would no longer work with mr @entity5 – who has also been suspended by @entity10 – in response to a damning report about his inspections			1
concerns were raised with @entity10 over similarities in mr @entity5 's reports in 2012 , but @entity10 insisted they were accurate			2
@entity4 has now said it will not work with mr @entity5 ' as a result of new evidence ' in one example , he used identical wording to describe the maths teaching at three schools he inspected in 2012			1
another three schools inspected between 2012 and 2014 had almost identical wording about the support given to new pupils , the investigation by education newspaper @entity27 found			2
@entity4 ’s chief operating officer @entity32 said concerns were raised with @entity10 over the similarities in some of mr @entity5 ’s reports in 2012			1
