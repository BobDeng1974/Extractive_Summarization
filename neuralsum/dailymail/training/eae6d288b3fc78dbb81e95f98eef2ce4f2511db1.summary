they have been a familiar site at the @entity3 's heels ever since she was presented with one for her 18th birthday in 1944			1
but now the @entity3 - who is known to be inseparable from her beloved @entity5 - has decided against introducing any new dogs to @entity7			1
she no longer replaces the pets as they die and , as she gets older , she is worried about tripping over the small dogs			1
she asked her grandmother if she would like two of four @entity28 terriers , born to her own dog @entity29 last september			0
a senior courtier told the @entity32 : ' @entity3 thought it was a lovely offer but she politely declined			1
' the fact is she worries about too many dogs around her feet and the danger she will trip up and hurt herself badly			2
she is after all 88 and not getting any younger			0
' her corgis are getting on a bit and move along at a sedate speed but a young dog would obviously be very lively and much more active			2
' her main fear is that if she fell and broke her arm or even a leg she would not be able to perform her duties for many weeks if not months , and that would upset her greatly			0
' while she has a reputation for being rather firm and fierce in other matters , the @entity3 is ridiculously soppy over her corgis the @entity3 relaxes with prince @entity49 with their corgis while reading the newspapers at @entity18 in 1975 @entity3 meets members of the @entity54 and their corgis during a trip in 2002 over the years , the @entity57 seem to have embraced dogs as their favoured pets			1
formal portraits from the 17th century onwards show them posing with dogs , from pugs to greyhounds , @entity60 to @entity5			1
some pets have even merited their own portraits			0
when @entity3 @entity69 's beloved @entity68 , @entity70 , died at @entity18 in 1887 , he was buried in the grounds of the castle and given his own gravestone			1
a terrier named @entity75 belonging to @entity76 was given even greater status when , having outlived the king , he walked behind his majesty 's coffin in the funeral procession			2
one of the @entity82 , @entity83 , appeared in the @entity85 scene for the @entity87 opening ceremony			0
corgis were first introduced to the royal circle by @entity90 in 1933 when he bought a @entity5 called @entity91 from a local kennels			2
the animal proved popular with his daughters and a second @entity5 was acquired called @entity95 who had puppies , two of which , crackers and @entity99 , were kept			1
for her eighteenth birthday , @entity3 was given a @entity5 named @entity102			1
she became the matriarch of the royal @entity5 line and it was the beginning of a 70 - year love affair			2
some @entity5 were mated with dachsunds to create ' @entity108 ' , two of which , @entity109 and @entity110 , still survive , along with the two @entity111 and @entity112			2
the @entity82 have hit the headlines before - in 2004 one had to be put down after being savaged by an @entity115 bull terrier owned by @entity116 when they ran out to greet her as she arrived at @entity118 for @entity119			0
@entity116 was convicted under the @entity120 the year before that after the same dog attacked two children , becoming the first member of the @entity57 ever to acquire a criminal record after admitting letting the dog run out of control			0
the @entity82 have enjoyed life as @entity129 's most privileged pets			0
they live in palaces and castles , travel in chauffeur - driven limousines , fly by private plane or helicopter and are carried down aircraft steps by aides			0
the @entity3 is said to feed them fillet steak and chicken breast and all the food is cooked from scratch , with a new @entity5 menu typed and posted to the kitchen wall daily			1
they live in a boxroom that holds their wicker baskets , raised a few inches off the floor to avoid draughts			0
it is situated in the royal apartments , around which the dogs wander at will .			0
