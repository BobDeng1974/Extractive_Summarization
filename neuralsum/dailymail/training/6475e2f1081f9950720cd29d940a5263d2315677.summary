during his first week on the $ 160,000 job as mr @entity4 's adviser in 2010 , mr @entity2 was asked to stay with the then - mp in his @entity12 home			1
the gay @entity14 man said he was not surprised by the invitation as others before him had been asked the same question			0
' he was in pair of boxers , he laid down on his bed - stomach down - and i stood beside the bed and massaged just his neck , ' mr @entity2 told 60 minutes reporter @entity35			2
' it was during that time he started with a moan that could only be described as sexual			0
' and i felt uncomfortable and just said : " you 're done " , and i walked out of the room			0
' but the next day it escalated with mr @entity2 claiming the former speaker questioned why he showered with the door closed			2
he said mr @entity4 called him a ' prude ' for not admitting the practice was abnormal			2

despite the reception he received from his adviser , mr @entity4 kept pressing him - at one point texting : u want something more ? @entity63 brilliant at massages '			2
this is when mr @entity4 dropped his friendliness and started excluding mr @entity2 from work functions and asked to be contacted through his parliamentary adviser , @entity69			1
but mr @entity2 claims the harassment continued , with mr @entity4 one day asking personal questions about his sex life that left him shocked , saying : ' we were lucky we did n't run off the road			1

' mr @entity4 has been found guilty of fraud against the taxpayer			2
' ' mr @entity2 settled a sexual harassment case with the @entity95			1
' i had no specific knowledge of the allegations made by mr @entity2 and the first i knew that he was suing mr @entity4 was when i read it in the newspapers			1
' this is a dispute between two individuals - not a dispute that includes me or any other member of the government			0
' mr @entity88 was contacted by 60 minutes but the program said he declined to comment on the matter			0

' before i knew it , @entity135 picked up the phone			0
' but mr @entity135 has denied the allegations			0
