the thermometer reading @entity1 shared on social media to prove he was too ill to play against @entity3 on wednesday night will make no difference to @entity5			1
@entity7 ’s manager had already gone cold on the @entity8 , concluding some time ago that he has no future at @entity10			1
@entity5 will admit he ignored the warnings about @entity1			1
he knew @entity12 considered him ‘ unmanageable ’ and he listened to the anecdotal evidence he received from the members of his staff who had encountered the troublesome striker during their time at @entity18			0
but @entity5 rather hoped @entity1 might be maturing with age , and he made the mistake of thinking he could succeed where others had failed in actually getting through to him			1
@entity1 has no future at @entity7 after manager @entity5 lost patience with the striker @entity5 will admit he ignored the warning signs but had hoped @entity1 was maturing as he got older @entity1 shared an image of a thermometer reading to prove he was too ill to play against @entity3 @entity7 ’s manager was desperate too , of course			1
attempts to recruit other strikers , in particular @entity32 , had proved unsuccessful last summer and he was concerned that @entity33 would not provide ample cover in a @entity36 season if @entity37 suffered further injury problems			0
he was right to worry about @entity37 ’s physical fragility but wrong , he would probably now concede , to spend £ 16million on @entity1			2
for three hours in his office at @entity41 he attempted to lessen the risk before asking his employers to part with the money			0
he spoke both to @entity1 and his agent , explaining what was expected of every @entity7 player and sharing his philosophy on the power of the collective			1
over the years his @entity55 principles speech – commitment			0
excellence – had worked with players			0
he would use a flip - chart to deliver his lecture on the standards he demands and , for the most part , players had responded accordingly			0
not the player who already had a reputation for having no respect for authority , for his considerable talent or for the clubs he represents			0
@entity7 missed out on @entity32 last summer and instead paid £ 16m to sign @entity1 from @entity73 @entity1 has endured a torrid time at @entity10 and has managed to score just once in the @entity75 @entity5 is saddened by the fact @entity77 international @entity1 appears to have no respect for @entity7 @entity79 ( a ) lost 3 - 1 , november 23 , 2014 reason : @entity81 and groin injuries @entity84 ( a ) @entity83 2 - 2 , november 26 , 2014 reason : @entity81 and groin injuries @entity87 ( @entity86 ) won 1 - 0 , november 29 , 2014 reason : @entity81 and groin injuries @entity89 ( a ) won 1 - 3 , december 2 , 2014 reason : @entity81 and groin injuries @entity91 ( @entity86 ) @entity83 0 - 0 , december 6 , 2014 reason : @entity81 and groin injuries @entity92 ( @entity86 ) @entity83 1 - 1 , december 9 , 2014 reason : @entity81 and groin injuries @entity93 ( a ) won 3 - 1 , december 17 , 2014 reason : groin injury @entity95 ( @entity86 ) @entity83 2 - 2 , december 21 , 2014 reason : one - match ban @entity89 ( @entity86 ) @entity83 2 - 2 , january 1 , 2015 reason : not selected @entity97 ( a ) won 2 - 0 , january 17 , 2015 reason : illness @entity100 ( @entity86 ) @entity83 1 - 1 , januray 20 , 2015 reason : illness @entity102 ( @entity86 ) @entity83 0 - 0 , january 24 , 2015 reason : not selected @entity103 ( @entity86 ) won 2 - 0 , january 31 , 2015 reason : not selected @entity102 ( a ) won 2 - 1 , february 4 , 2015 reason : not selected @entity106 ( a ) @entity83 0 - 0 , february 7 , 2015 reason : not selected @entity107 ( a ) won 1 - 0 , march 16 , 2015 reason : illness @entity95 ( a ) lost 4 - 1 , april 4 , 2015 reason : knee injury @entity3 ( a ) won 1 - 0 , april 8 , 2015 reason : illness @entity5 is saddened by the fact that @entity1 appears to have no respect for @entity7 , and no apparent willingness to even follow the simplest instructions			1
in @entity37 ’s absence @entity5 told @entity1 he needed a striker who would ‘ press ’ at the point of @entity7 ’s attack ; who would play high up the field and in so doing set the pattern of @entity7 ’s play			1
@entity1 , much to his manager ’s frustration , just would n’t do it , in the misguided belief that he knew better			2
on the training field there have been similar issues ; a situation that has offended team - mates who do buy into @entity5 ’ methods and want to build on the success they enjoyed last season			0
so there will be no second chance for @entity1 at @entity7 next season ; no opportunity to redeem himself			2
@entity5 is continuing to use him when absolutely necessary but he is at the very top of a list of players he will be putting up for sale this summer			0
he has to get him out and put what money he can recover for him to better use , if only to improve morale in a dressing room that probably lost patience with the guy before even he did			2
@entity7 players are offended @entity1 has not followed simple instructions from his manager this season			2
