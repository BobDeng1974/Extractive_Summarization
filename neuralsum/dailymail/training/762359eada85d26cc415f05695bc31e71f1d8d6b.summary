@entity9 ( @entity10 ) @entity12 ’s turquoise gloves waved defeat from the cockpit of his ailing @entity1			1
and so , after four months of misfortune , hurt and rancour , @entity0 was handed the @entity18 lead			1
@entity12 ’s race - ending gesture while sitting in the pit lane having completed just 13 laps was the result of electrical problems that beset him from the moment he turned out of the @entity1 garage here under the floodlit splendour of @entity30			1
a broken steering column forced him to go straight back for a replacement even before the race had started , and he returned to the grid just in time for lights out			1
but that did him no good			0
he could not get going and remained glued to his grid place — second , behind @entity38 — as the formation lap began around him			2
@entity0 sprays champagne in second - placed @entity2 's face after he re-passed the four - times world champion to take the lead of the race @entity0 celebrates his seventh win of the season in @entity30			1
he is now three points clear of @entity12 in the battle for the @entity50 championship the @entity51 turned in a gutsy display to claim the 29th victory of his career			1
he was forced to re-pass @entity2 after he stayed out during the safety car period 1			1

@entity2 ( @entity3 ) 124 6			1
@entity56 ( @entity8 ) 122 so the @entity58 ’s mechanics wheeled him into the pit lane , from where he started			1
still the gremlins continued to curse him			0
his gears were jumping about like a box of frogs			0
he was helpless as he went from third to fifth , from fifth to seventh , and so on			0
@entity1 had no choice but to call him into the pits , by which time he had gamely passed @entity69 in his @entity70 , but nobody else			1
he chugged in , needing to stall the car to stop it			0
his team had intended to fit his car with a new steering column but , unable to resuscitate him , he declared his afternoon ’s driving over			2
@entity12 kept his helmet on as he trudged around the garage disconsolately , but that could only partly hide his emotions			2
@entity81 , the @entity1 team boss , consoled him			2
@entity12 's car is wheeled away off the grid after he suffered a problem with the electronics on his mercedes @entity12 managed to get going , before calling it a day on lap 15 despite @entity1 ' best efforts to rectify his problem @entity0 , who started on pole in @entity30 , sprints away from the pack			1
@entity5 escaped a penalty despite cutting the corner @entity0 , who for most of the season has trailed his @entity1 team - mate in the championship , now leads him by three points @entity98 , wife of the @entity1 driver , provides some encouraging words for her husband following his retirement from the @entity30 @entity103 so did @entity98 , his wife of three months			1
he soon went to the pit wall to watch @entity0 win , his eyes beadily fixed on the screens			1
‘ it was the toughest day of the year , ’ he said afterwards			0
‘ it was even worse than @entity111 ( where his gear box broke when he was leading )			0
‘ none of the steering wheel functions worked — so i had no @entity115 , and so on			0
the gears were all over the place			0
my brake balance was totally wrong			0
everything was all over the place			0
’ other than for the 28 ° c heat and 75 per cent humidity , it should have been a straightforward task for @entity0 to convert his chance of victory , which had been set up not only by @entity12 ’s misfortune but by his own splendid qualifying lap that conjured pole position out of hot air			1
but it did not go quite so smoothly as that when the safety car was called into action halfway through the race , after @entity135 of @entity136 had hit @entity138 ’s @entity137			2
the interruption cut @entity0 ’s lead , yet he still needed to change his tyres and get out ahead of his pursuers , who did not require new rubber			1
so he had to re-establish a big enough gap to @entity2 in second place — about 27 seconds — to pit and come out in front			2
@entity5 finished fourth despite hustling the @entity148 of @entity2 and @entity4 all the way to the finish @entity4 , who replaced fellow @entity152 @entity151 at @entity3 this season , holds of @entity5 at the @entity30 @entity103 1			1

@entity0 grew anxious as he tried to establish that impregnable margin			2
he told his engineer , @entity183 , that his rear tyres might explode			0
now , @entity183 has the reassuring tone of a nurse with a needle saying : ‘ you ’ll just feel a small prick			0
’ it was in those soothing tones he called in @entity38 , his tyres fading and his lead standing at just over 25 seconds			0
@entity0 came out behind @entity2 but , in just over a lap , he had squeezed past him , victory now assured			1
he patted his car afterwards and was cheered by a crowd containing a rich smattering of expats employed in the skyscrapers that provide part of the evocative backdrop to the @entity204 circuit			0
plenty of @entity152 flags were waved for him as well			0
this was the perfect result for @entity0 : maximum points while @entity12 scored none			1
it gave the @entity51 a lead — three points — for the first time since before the @entity215 at the end of may			2
‘ i was dreaming it last night but you never really think it ’s going to happen , ’ said @entity0			2
after a tumultuous first half of the season , @entity0 has finally picked up some consistency and managed to rid himself of the mechanical problems that had plagued him current world champion @entity2 has struggled for form this season , and has often been outshone by team - mate @entity4 there is a serenity in @entity0 ’s mood since he turned up in @entity228 , a race he also won			1
but experience tells us that his psyche is brittle			0
can he ride out the inevitable stresses of the final five races ? upon the answer may hinge the destiny of the title			0
the presence of his father @entity239 here for a second successive race may be the crucial fillip			2
he has never won a title without his dad and mainstay at his side			0
@entity239 said : ‘ he has the right perspective about where he is			0
@entity249 it ’s @entity50 , the greatest sport on the planet			0
just do n’t take it too seriously			0
he ’s very calm because he ’s enjoying it			0
everything comes to those who wait			0
’ @entity2 took second place and @entity4 third in a satisfying day for @entity3 , whose pre-season started so unpropitiously that they sat out virtually all the first test			1
their reliability is now sometimes embarrassing the @entity1 super-team			2
but @entity3 boss @entity263 said last night he still does not believe in favouring @entity4 through the imposition of team orders , even though he is 60 points behind @entity38 and @entity2 is 117 adrift			1
with the final race in @entity270 worth double points , they may yet prevail if @entity1 keep conking out			1
@entity69 is chased by @entity12 before his unfortunate retirement at the @entity30 @entity103 in stark contrast to the last time he was on pole , @entity0 enjoyed an excellent start to the @entity276 but @entity12 experienced problems immediately			1

@entity0 claimed his second successive victory to move to the top of the championship
@entity2 finished second while @entity3 team - mate @entity4 completed the *podium*
@entity0 pitted one more time than his rivals which meant he had to pass @entity2 to *re-take* the lead and win the race
his rival @entity12 started from the pit lane after he suffered an electronic problem ahead of the race
the @entity58 was then forced to retire on lap 15 despite @entity1 ' best efforts to solve the issue
@entity0 is now three points clear of @entity12 with five races remaining
