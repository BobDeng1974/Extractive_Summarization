by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 have hijacked @entity4 's move for @entity5 left back @entity6 by tabling a £ 14million offer plus @entity8 on loan and including midfielder @entity10			1
@entity6 is one of the hottest properties in @entity12 at the moment and has attracted interest among @entity16 's elite including @entity17 and @entity4			1
the @entity19 club were thought to be leading the race to sign the exciting 21 - year - old			0
but new @entity2 boss @entity22 wants to make @entity6 his first summer signing and has given the green light to the lucrative offer			0
@entity4 have offered £ 20m for the defender , but @entity5 value @entity6 at £ 25m			2
however the @entity50 are still favourites to land @entity6 due to their participation in next season 's @entity52			2
it remains unclear what @entity5 's response to @entity2 ' offer has been , but the @entity59 club will hope for a bidding war between @entity4 and @entity2 in the coming days			2
future potential : @entity6 has three caps for @entity12 at just 21 - years - old anguish : @entity8 has been offered to @entity5 on loan as part of the deal having scored just two @entity36 goals from open play in his first season at @entity2 frustration : @entity8 joined @entity2 in a £ 26million move from @entity71 but struggled to adapt to the first team they have also thrown in @entity10 , who cost £ 8million , but will move to @entity74 for nothing , although @entity2 retain 50 per cent of his re-sale fee			1
interestingly , @entity2 's decision to include @entity8 as part of the deal raises serious question marks over the striker 's future at @entity83			0
the forward arrived from @entity71 last summer with the reputation of being a prolific goalscorer , but failed to live up to his billing as he struggled for goals in his first season			0
and it now looks like he has been deemed surplus to requirements by @entity22			0
sweeping changes : @entity22 is preparing for his first season as @entity2 boss after resigning from @entity96 he 's ours ! @entity46 is also interested in @entity6 and @entity4 remain favourites to sign the full - back			1
