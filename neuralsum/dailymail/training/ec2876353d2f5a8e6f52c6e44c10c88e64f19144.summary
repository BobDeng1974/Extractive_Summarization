by @entity0 published : 07:37 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 07:38 est , 5 june 2013 parents are too obsessed by their children doing brilliantly in exams and are over-looking the importance of them getting a job , according to the government - backed women ’s @entity6			1
when they are young , it is also extremely useful for a child to get a part - time job , such as working in a local shop on a saturday , it said			1
@entity15 , from the women ’s @entity6 , who is also chief executive of the recruitment company @entity16 , said there has been a ‘ huge change ’ over the last decade			1
obsession : the women 's @entity6 said a generation of children were leaving school with little or no real experience of the workplace it used to be commonplace for children to do part - time jobs while they were at school , but this trend has now been overtaken by many parents ’ obsession with academic excellence			1
as a result , a generation of children are leaving school or university with little or no real experience of the workplace , which leaves them totally unprepared for working life			1
mrs @entity15 said parents should think twice before pressurising their children to achieve top grades to the exclusion of anything else			2
she said : ‘ i think it is the pressure that we are putting children under to excel and exceed in academic life			2
‘ it means that they then do n’t get the practical work experience of : " this is what it is going to be like to find a job when i leave school "			1
' saturday job : a spokeswoman for the council said part - time work helped to teach children how to multi-task and boosted their employability she added : ‘ there are an awful lot of graduates leaving university at the moment who literally have got no work experience at all			1
it is a huge deficit			0
’ she raised fears some schools are discouraging pupils from getting a part - time job because they worry it will disrupt their academic studies and consequently hit the school ’s performance in league tables			1
mrs @entity15 said : ‘ i think they [ schools ] can often advise children : " do n’t get a saturday job			2
focus on your education " , particularly because they want to improve their performance on tables			0
‘ you need to have employable young people leaving our education system			0
that is not just about their academic ability			0
’ her own career was shaped by getting a job at the supermarket chain @entity93 ’s when she was a 16 - year - old school girl			2
warnings : @entity95 recently emphasised the importance of flexible working opportunities for women with young children she worked every thursday night from 5pm - 8pm and for seven hours every saturday , and went onto to work for @entity93 ’s for 12 years rising rapidly up the career ladder			1
but too many modern parents want their children ‘ to focus purely on the academic route ’ , she said , which does not help their long - term job prospects			1
by getting a job while they are a school , it helps children to learn the crucial skill of ‘ multi-tasking ’ , such as finishing their homework , revising for exams and holding down a job			2
the warning comes as @entity95 , the women ’s minister , said women ’s career opportunities are being hurt by ‘ a workplace designed by men for men			2
’ she said working flexibly is absolutely crucial for a woman to be able to succeed , particularly when her children are young			0
mrs @entity95 , who has three children , said : ‘ the evidence is clear			0
speaking as an employer myself i know that if you can offer employees that flexibility , you can keep the best for longer			0
’ she said it is wrong that so many women ’s careers ‘ stall at the nursery gate ’ , and that they ‘ simply disappear off the radar when it comes to more senior executive positions			0
’ mrs @entity95 pointed out that this year is the 100th anniversary of the death of @entity141 , the suffragette who died after stepping in front of the @entity146 ’s horse at the @entity147			0
she said it was ‘ remarkable ’ that women in the workplace ‘ remains an issue ’ , adding : ‘ you would have thought we would have dealt with that by now , but we have n’t			2
’ one of @entity155 ’s top female bosses , @entity156 , chairman of the women ’s @entity6 , urged working mothers to share their experiences with one another			1
the mother - of - two who is chief executive of the outsourcing giant @entity163 said : ‘ actually saying : do you know it is really tough			0
it is ok for it to be tough			0
‘ we are not expecting everyone to find sleepless nights and board meetings the next day an easy option			0
’ @entity172 , from the campaign group mothers at @entity174 and a full - time mother of two young children , said : ‘ i could n’t agree more that the macho culture at the heart of many companies needs to be changed			1
‘ women who are in work should n’t face discrimination on account of their sex			0
