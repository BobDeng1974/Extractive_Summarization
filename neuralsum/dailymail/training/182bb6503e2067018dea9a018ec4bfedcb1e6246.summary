by @entity0 @entity1 has revealed an astonishing image of a giant solar ' whip ' on the surface of the sun captured as a solar flare erupted			1
the amazing image , captured on may 3rd , shows a solar prominence , a loop of red hot plasma which remains attached to the sun , and appeared just as a solar flare was subsiding			1
experts say it is another sign the sun is ' waking up ' as it approaches its 11 year solar maximum , which is due later this year			1
a burst of solar material leaps off the left side of the sun in what is known as a prominence eruption			0
this image combines three images from @entity1 's @entity25 captured on may 3 , 2013 , at 1:45 pm edt , just as an m - class solar flare from the same region was subsiding			1
a solar prominence is a large , bright feature extending outward from the @entity30 's surface			0
a prominence forms over timescales of about a day , and the red - glowing looped material is plasma , a hot gas comprised of electrically charged hydrogen and helium			0
an erupting prominence occurs when such a structure becomes unstable and bursts outward , releasing the plasma			0
the loop was created as the sun shot out a solar flare towards @entity43			1
this flare is classified as an m5.7 - class flare			0
@entity47 - class flares are the weakest flares that can still cause some space weather effects near @entity43			2
increased numbers of flares are quite common at the moment , as the sun 's normal 11 - year activity cycle is ramping up toward solar maximum , which is expected in late 2013 , @entity1 said			1
' increased numbers of flares are quite common at the moment , since the sun 's normal 11 - year cycle is ramping up toward solar maximum , which is expected in late 2013 , ' @entity1 has said			1
humans have tracked this solar cycle continuously since it was discovered , and it is normal for there to be many flares a day during the sun 's peak activity , @entity1 said			0
it claims the danger form the flare shown here has already passed			0
the solar prominence is clearly visible on this full disc image of the sun captured by @entity1 's @entity25 spacecraft			0
' solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation			0
' harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity43 's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground , however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where gps and communications signals travel			1
' this disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is ongoing , and the radio blackout for this flare has already subsided			2

this disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is ongoing , anywhere from minutes to hours			2
this image shows light in the 131 - angstrom wavelength , a wavelength of light that can show material at the very hot temperatures of a solar flare and that is typically colorized in teal .			2

11 year solar maximum is expected in late 2013
latest flare *believed* to have caused radio disruption on @entity43
