by @entity1 reporter published : 12:19 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 13:58 est , 29 october 2012 squatters have moved into one of @entity5 's oldest pubs in @entity5 previously frequented by @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 - and plan to make it popular again by serving sunday lunches			1
the 300 - year - old @entity12 pub in @entity13 was boarded up by its owner @entity14 earlier this year after it stopped making a profit			1
mr @entity14 planned to turn the building into a Â£ 10million residential complex with a swimming pool but was refused planning permission			1
closed up : the 300 - year - old @entity20 in @entity13 was closed by its owner after it stopped making a profit but 17 squatters have taken over the building and are exempt from a new law giving the police the power to arrest them for squatting in a residential property as the pub remains commercial			1
the group , all aged between 17 and 36 , insist they plan to turn the property into an art gallery and public library while also serving up sunday lunch			2
@entity37 theatre student @entity36 , 28 , said : ' this is a commercial property which is boarded up and empty so we can squat here			2
we have welcomed many members of the community in and everyone seems quite happy about us being here			0
' i work and i 'm a student			0
i have rented before in @entity5 recently but found that in order to survive i have to work many hours a week in order to pay the rent and my grades began to slip as i was working when i should have been studying			0
' in a note attached to the outside of the building , which has been boarded up since the summer , the squatters wrote : ' hello neighbours , we are your friendly local squatters			2
new residents : 17 squatters , aged between 17 and 36 , have moved in to the property and plan to turn it into an art gallery where they serve sunday lunches ' i can assure you that we are quiet and respectful and we would love to seamlessly become a part of your community			1
we are keeping your pub safe and tidy until it is going to be used again			2
' a spokesman for the @entity63 , which has been campaigning to save some of the area 's historic pubs , told the @entity66 : ' there really is delicious irony in this as @entity14 failed to turn it into a residence , but now against his will it has indeed turned into one for squatters			1
' the squatters really could n't be nicer and say they wo n't allow anyone in who is a nuisance			0
they are very courteous and polite and have offered us a sunday roast and say they want to turn the space into an art gallery			0
' but mr @entity14 said it was ' outrageous ' that the squatters could move into the pub. he told the @entity82 : ' the notice they have put on the door is rubbish and the police have been called out by neighbours some three times already			1
it has brought crime to the area			0
' they are professional squatters who know exactly what they are doing			0
they will be gone in a week or so , i think they will probably walk out after november 5			0

the 300 - year - old @entity12 pub in @entity13 was first opened in 1708
owner @entity14 closed the pub earlier this year after it stopped making a profit and planned to turn it into a residential complex
the 17 squatters are exempt from a new law giving the police the power to arrest them as the pub is a commercial , not residential , building
