@entity5 developed the phobia after being chased down a street by one when she was three - it was so bad she would *n't* leave the house
parents had to cancel holidays and family trips to beach in case they came into contact with a dog - @entity5 would shake and cry if she saw one
her younger brother , @entity70 , was desperate for a puppy so the family realised something needed to be done about @entity5 's phobia
she had a few sessions of hypnotherapy and is now *besotted* with her puppy
