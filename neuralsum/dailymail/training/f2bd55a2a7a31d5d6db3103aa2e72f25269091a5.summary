there is clear scientific evidence that the benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks , a landmark report has declared			0
a debate has long raged over the ethics of the procedure - and some men believe it has affected their sexual function or satisfaction			2
but @entity13 officials have now said the medical evidence supports having the procedure			2
the announcement came in new long - awaited draft guidelines released by the @entity17 ( @entity17 )			1
this is the first time the @entity19 has released such a report on circumcision , where the foreskin around the tip of the penis is cut away			1
guidelines : @entity13 medical experts have declared there is now clear medical evidence to support circumcision while the guidelines stop short of telling parents to get their newborn sons circumcised , they are very clear on the health advantages			0
' that is a personal decision that may involve religious or cultural preferences ' , said the @entity17 's dr. @entity35 , who oversees the agency 's programs on @entity38 and other sexually transmitted diseases			1
the procedure is done because germs can grow underneath the foreskin			2
@entity17 officials say circumcision can lower a man 's risk of sexually - transmitted diseases , penile cancer and even urinary tract infections			1
the new guidelines are the result of seven years of work , after a cluster of influential studies in @entity56 indicated circumcision might help stop spread of the @entity59 virus			0
' the benefits of male circumcision have become more and more clear over the last ten years , ' said dr @entity62 , a @entity63 researcher involved in one of the african studies			0
but the guidelines are important , because the rates of newborn male circumcision have been dropping , he added			2
in the new guidelines , the @entity17 says there is now strong evidence that male circumcision can : studies have not shown that circumcision will reduce an @entity38 - infected man 's chances of spreading the @entity59 virus to women			1
and research has not found circumcision to be a help in stopping spread of @entity38 during gay sex			2
the guidelines say circumcision is safer for newborns and infants than for older males , noting the complication rate rises from 0.5 per cent in newborns to nine per cent in children ages one to nine			2
minor bleeding and pain are the most common problems , experts say			0
@entity17 officials are recommending doctors tell parents of baby boys of the benefits and risks of circumcision - but does not detail how that information should be presented			1
because circumcision can be beneficial to men as well , the @entity17 says information about the procedure also should be given to sexually active uncircumcised men - especially men considered to be at higher risk of catching @entity38 , the report says			1
however the guidelines , which the public will be able to comment on for the next 40 days , are likely to draw intense opposition from anti-circumcision advocacy groups			1
' this is a passionate issue for them and they feel strongly that circumcision is wrong , ' said dr @entity115 , a professor of pediatrics at the @entity117			0
the thinking on circumcision has swung wildly over the years			0
while it has been practiced by @entity120 and @entity121 for thousands of years , it did n't become common in the @entity13 until the 20th century			0
controversial : the new guidelines , which state how the procedure can cut risk for @entity38 , stds and penile cancer , are expected to draw intense opposition from anti-circumcision advocacy groups by one estimate , only 25 per cent of @entity13 male newborns were circumcised in 1900			1
it gradually became the cultural norm , and in the 1950s and 1960s surpassed 80 per cent			0
but then the trend reversed			0
this was partly to do with changing demographics , as the @entity13 population grew to include larger numbers of @entity138 and other ethnic groups that did n't traditionally circumcise their children			0
also , opposition to the procedure grew from advocates who decried the pain , bleeding and risk of infections to newborns , the @entity141 reports			1
their message was aided by the @entity151 and by the neutral stance of physicians groups - including , for a time , the @entity154			0
by 2010 the newborn circumcision rate was down to about 58 per cent , according to one @entity17 estimate			1
but even as the circumcision rate dropped , more medical evidence came in supporting it - particularly three rigorous and influential studies in @entity56 that looked at the spread of @entity38 and other sexually transmitted diseases in circumcised and uncircumcised men and their partners .			1
