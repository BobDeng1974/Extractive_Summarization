@entity1 ceo @entity0 has boasted that over a million people signed up to @entity3 in the first week @entity1 ceo @entity0 has hit back at two major retailers who blocked the firm 's new mobile phone payment system @entity3 , claiming over a million users have signed up to the service in the first week			1
drugstore chains @entity9 and @entity11 both last week stopped customers using the new service which lets users pay for goods by holding a smartphone close to a specially designed terminal			1
but mr @entity0 said there were plenty of other retailers around the world signing up , claiming @entity3 already totes up more transactions than all other ' contactless ' payment methods combined			1
such services have failed to catch on in the @entity25 despite the backing of @entity27 and other influential players			0
@entity29 emerged over the weekend that the two retailers had opted out of @entity3 in favor of a rival system that roughly 50 chains , including @entity34 and @entity35 , are developing for in - house use			1
' we 've got a lot more merchants to sign up , we 've got a lot of banks to sign up and we 've got the rest of the world , ' @entity0 told the @entity45 conference , in the company 's most extensive comments on the blockade so far			1
in launching @entity3 , the @entity50 maker hopes to lock in more customers for its mobile devices by enhancing their overall utility			1
industry experts say it stands a chance of becoming thefirst widely used payments feature on smartphones			0
but the driving force behind developing a retailer - owned mobile payment solution is to avoid paying credit card transaction fees to card companies like @entity74 and @entity75 , analysts said			2
fees range between 2 percent and 3 percent of costs per transaction			0
@entity3 is compatible with the @entity50 , @entity79 and the @entity80			2
the mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the @entity86 button			0
this confirms the person 's identity , and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card			0
all details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely			0
if an @entity50 is lost , users can suspend all payments via the find my @entity50 service			2
@entity11 stopped accepting @entity3 last week at its 4,572 stores			1
spokeswoman @entity102 said the company was evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies			0
@entity9 did not respond to queries seeking comment but a visit to two of its stores showed that the @entity112 ( @entity112 ) reader on which @entity3 was used had been deactivated			1
it remains to be seen , despite early signs of success , whether mobile payments will become widely adopted			0
@entity0 argued on monday that @entity3 offered better security and privacy than competing services , and that retailers risked alienating customers by limiting choices at checkout			1
' it 's a skirmish , ' @entity0 said in response to a question about the retailers ' moves			2
' merchants have different objectives sometimes			0
but in the long arc of time , you only are relevant as a retailer or merchant if your customers love you			0
