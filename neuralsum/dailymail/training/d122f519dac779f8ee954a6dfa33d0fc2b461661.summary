@entity1 captain @entity0 believes @entity2 currently boast the strongest team in the northern hemisphere but insists the @entity1 can still win when the sides meet in the @entity6 on saturday week			1
@entity1 open up their campaign at the @entity9 , knowing their opponents are in strong form after recording wins over @entity14 and @entity15 in the autumn series			2
those victories pushed @entity2 up to third in the @entity18 and @entity0 admits @entity1 are in for a tough game in 10 days ' time			1
@entity1 captain @entity0 believes @entity2 currently boast the strongest team in the northern hemisphere ' @entity2 are probably the best team in the northern hemisphere - it is a chance for us to play them at home , ' @entity0 said			1
' everyone saw how @entity2 played in november			2
' they are a very complete team , they have good backs , good forwards , they are very dynamic especially in terms of defence			0
' they are good at the turnover , at building mauls and getting in front of teams - they are a difficult team to play against			0
' i know they have some injuries but they will arrive with a very competitive side			0
' from left to right : @entity0 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 pose with the new @entity6 trophy ahead of the tournament , which starts in february and finishes in march @entity1 recorded an historic 22 - 15 win when the two teams last met at @entity9 in 2013 but @entity2 exacted revenge at home 12 months ago with a 46 - 7 victory			1
' as @entity60 , we are not at the same level as @entity2 , ' @entity0 said			1
' we beat them two years ago but last year they won by 40 points in @entity65			0
' it is important for us to be competitive and see if we are really , really far from them or if we are able to play a full match at our best and beat a team like @entity2			1
' it is important because we are going to play them in a few months ' time at the @entity73			0
' it is important for us mentally to know we can beat these teams			0
@entity76 of @entity2 lifts the old trophy after being crowned champions in 2014 ' if we play 100 games against @entity2 we would probably lose 98 so we have a small opportunity to beat them but we have to play every match with this ambition			1
' we have to try to be competitive against every team we play at the @entity85			0
' after a superb 2013 campaign , which also included a 23 - 18 victory over @entity88 , @entity1 lost all their matches in last year 's championships and finished bottom of the table			2
' we have shown we can be competitive and we can win like when we beat very good teams in 2013 , ' @entity0 added			2
' but last year we played a poor 6 nations and that is the difference between a great team and a team who can get a great result , but do not have the same consistency			0
' that is the target this year - to have more consistency , especially in the three matches we play at home			0
' @entity1 captain @entity0 poses with the new @entity6 trophy			1
