the prospect of a $ 34 million fiber - optic line that would dramatically improve mobile connectivity in @entity3 has ignited furious debate over whether any place should be off - limits to technology			1
park officials are in preliminary discussions with @entity10 about plans to install a wireless service that would allow streaming deep within the historical national park			1
but critics have argued that the line , reaching from the neighboring @entity16 , could compromise @entity3 's natural wilderness			1
the amateur photographer said he was not surprised when he ran into trouble uploading pictures during a july tour of the park with his family details on the @entity3 fiber optic project were obtained by @entity28 through a public records request and confirmed by @entity30			1
the @entity33 advocacy group 's executive director , @entity31 , warned that bumping up the park 's bandwidth will create more electronic distractions at the expense of the park 's natural wonders			1
sprawled across nearly 3,500 square miles spanning @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , @entity3 is a mountain wilderness featuring lakes , canyons and rivers			1
it is home to grizzly bears , wolves , and herds of bison and elk and is famed for its hundreds of geysers - hot springs that erupt periodically - including @entity56			0
the @entity10 proposal comes as concession companies have been pushing for more digital access in national parks , including @entity62 's @entity61 , @entity64 ' @entity63 and @entity66 's @entity65			1
it also coincides with a @entity69 campaign to ' @entity70 ' ahead of its 100th anniversary in 2016			0
it is a notion far removed from the park system 's early days , when president @entity74 took a break from a national speaking tour and dropped from the public eye for two weeks to go camping in @entity3			1
yet as wireless connectivity spreads into almost every corner of modern life , the social pressures to ' whittle away ' at the remaining technology - free refuges are immense , said @entity84 , a professor and director of emerging media studies at @entity87			0

park officials are in preliminary discussions with @entity10 about plans to install a wireless service that would allow streaming deep within @entity3 sprawled across nearly 3,500 square miles spanning @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , @entity3 is a mountain wilderness featuring lakes , canyons and rivers professor @entity84 had a first - hand experience of these pressures this summer , when he traveled through @entity3 with his teenage children			1
whenever connectivity dropped off , the complaints from the teenagers would begin			0
' it was quite fascinating to see a naturally - occurring experiment about what happens when you take away technology from kids , ' professor @entity84 said			0
' they wanted to be in touch with their friends and exchange snapchat photos - not of the beautiful scenery but themselves			0
' another visitor , @entity18 of @entity117 , @entity118 , was not surprised when he ran into trouble uploading pictures during a july tour of @entity3 with his wife , son , 20 , and daughter , 23			2
@entity3 is famed for its hundreds of geysers , which are hot springs that erupt periodically ' you take a cell phone shot of one of the bison right next to you , almost looking in your window , and you want to get that up on @entity133 , ' said mr @entity18 , a 51 - year - old tech - savvy amateur photographer			2
' you pretty much know you 're not going to upload any normal - sized pictures from a cell phone , be we expected to face that			0
' he added that it would be ' neat ' if @entity3 had the same technological conveniences he finds outside the park , but said he would not be bothered if he went back and still had connection problems ten years from now			2
no survey has been done to determine the quality and extent of wireless coverage in the 401 parks and other attractions overseen by the @entity69 , agency spokeswoman @entity144 said			0
critics have warned that bumping up the park 's bandwidth will create more electronic distractions at the expense of the park 's natural wonders she explained that the ' @entity70 ' campaign will not shape up the same way in every park , and each will have to decide what is suitable			1
but she said that the park service has no intention of looking backward as it enters a second century			2
' people are dependent on wireless , they 're dependent on cellular - a mode of communication and activeness that is different from what the @entity69 has provided previously , ' ms @entity144 said			0
@entity173 - based @entity10 has not submitted a formal application on the @entity3 proposal , according to park officials and company spokeswoman @entity177			1
@entity3 is home to grizzly bears , as well as wolves , and herds of bison and elk for the project to make economic sense in such a remote area , ms @entity177 said , the company has asked for most costs to be covered by the @entity69 and companies that would benefit from the line , including @entity191 , @entity192 and park concessionaires			2
park officials said they have not agreed to provide any money			2
@entity3 technology chief @entity196 said the proposal offers a chance improve spotty and limited wireless services			2
he stressed that coverage still would be restricted to five developed areas inside the park			0
@entity203 of the fiber - optic line fear that the technology could compromise @entity3 's natural wilderness ' they would want you to think we 're going to do wall - to - wall coverage so people can watch @entity211 , ' mr @entity196 said , referring to the proposal 's critics			1
' it 's just about taking the infrastructure we have and making it work			0
' mr @entity31 , the advocacy group director , said it would be inappropriate for the park to put any money toward a fiber - optic line given its backlog of road maintenance and other basic infrastructure improvements			0
he said the park should halt discussions with @entity10 or invite public input into whether it is a good idea			1
but mr @entity31 also acknowledged that his group is up against a suffusion of technology that shows no signs of abating			0
' i think if we were to put it to a vote , we 're a @entity238 minority , ' he said .			0
