by @entity0 published : 05:23 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 09:36 est , 19 december 2012 @entity2 users could soon be able to report emergencies in 140 characters and bypass 999 calls under proposals aimed at making communication with the @entity9 's biggest fire service easier			1
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) has said that it will explore the idea of setting up the world 's first 999 emergency feed to ease pressure on the telephone service which takes more than 30million calls a year			1
the plans , which are part of the @entity10 's @entity18 , will not replace the 999 system			1
help : @entity2 users could soon be able to report emergencies in 140 characters or less but the plans have been slammed by union chiefs who believe that the idea could put lives at risk			1
@entity27 , @entity28 executive council member for @entity29 told the @entity30 : ' it is a ludicrous idea			1
' it will inevitably lead to more hoax calls			0
they sound like something the @entity10 has just blurted out			0
' some @entity2 users had already taken to the social networking site to report fires according to the @entity10 , and fire crews have previously used information and pictures tweeted by members of the public to help tackle emergencies			2
but fire chiefs have urged people to continue to dial 999 as their @entity2 feed @ @entity48 is not currently manned around the clock			1
the service will look at different social media , micro-blogging sites and smart - phone apps as alternatives to the current telephone system			1
it cites figures from @entity58 that suggest that the number of people talking on the phone is in decline and that 20 per cent of adults now use a smart phone			2
emergency : fire crews could soon come to your aid after a @entity2 request for help not up and running : fire chiefs have urged people to continue to dial 999 to report fires as its @entity2 feed is not currently manned round the clock ( file picture ) @entity78 , deputy commissioner of @entity10 , said : ' with over a billion people now using @entity81 and half a billion using @entity2 , it ’s quite clear that social media is here to stay			1
' the @entity10 is the biggest fire service in the country and we think it ’s important to look into ways to improve how we communicate with the public and how they can get in touch with us			0
' new idea : the plans are part of the @entity10 's @entity18 although the @entity10 has said it will work with other emergency services in @entity29 , both the @entity95 and the @entity96 distanced themselves from the idea and said that they have no plans to introduce a similar service			2
but the @entity10 said that cynics rubbished the idea of dialling 999 in an emergency when it was first introduced more than seven decades ago			2
@entity78 added : ' when it was first set up in 1935 , people said that dialling 999 to report emergencies would never work			0
' today @entity105 handles over 30 million emergency calls each year			0
' it ’s time to look at new ways for people to report emergencies quickly and efficiently and social media could provide the answer in the future			0
' the @entity10 currently uses @entity2 to give real - time updates on developing incidents and @entity81 to offer fire prevention and safety advice to @entity117			0
the plan will be subject to a public consultation next month			0
according to @entity2 , 2,000 messages are sent per second worldwide .			0

the @entity9 's largest *brigade* to look at alternatives to 999
@entity28 bosses call the idea ' ludicrous '
fire chiefs say it wo *n't* replace the current phone system
