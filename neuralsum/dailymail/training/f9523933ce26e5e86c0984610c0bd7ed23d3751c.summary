by @entity0 published : 08:43 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 08:43 est , 27 august 2012 @entity2 was n’t willing to leave his job as @entity5 governor to be @entity7 ’s running mate because he believed the former @entity9 governor would lose , sources said			1
several sources exclusively told the @entity11 that the fiery @entity5 governor doubted a win , and thought serving as @entity7 ’s vice presidential nominee was n’t worth the risk			1
the main reason for @entity2 ’s doubt , one source said , stemmed from @entity7 ’s choice to only release limited tax returns , as well as his disastrous international tour earlier this summer			2
doubt : @entity5 governor @entity2 , right , doubted @entity7 's win one source told the @entity11 the odd couple : another source said @entity2 's doubt stemmed from @entity7 's choice to only release limited tax returns , as well as his disastrous international tour earlier this summer one source told the @entity11 : ‘ there were people around him that wanted him to reconsider , to actually push to be vice president			1
but he ’s known there are real issues here			0
’ sources also said that the outspoken governor also worried about a @entity7 - @entity2 ticket because of two @entity41 rules			1
because of the way the laws have been written , large banks and investment advisers would not be allowed to thus , @entity2 , who will turn 50 next month , would have had to step down from his government position to ensure top campaign donations			1
another source from the @entity7 campaign added : ‘ @entity2 refused to resign under any circumstances			1
it had nothing to do with @entity2 ’ personality and everything to do with money			0
’ the governor has not yet commented on the @entity11 's front - page story			2
choice : @entity7 instead chose @entity61 congressman @entity60 , right , seen giving a speech in @entity63 last week ahead of the @entity64 however , @entity66 ’s @entity65 finds several issues with what the sources were saying			1
she writes today : ‘ no one has ever suggested @entity2 was actually offered the vp post , although he was in contention , and it seems unlikely he would have asked not to be considered			0
’ she said the bigger implication in the @entity11 ’s exclusive was that he thought @entity7 would lose the election			2
@entity2 will deliver the keynote address at the @entity64 in @entity79 , which has now been squeezed into three days because of @entity80			2
he has already been actively posting pictures ahead of the event on his @entity85 page			0
republicans already in @entity87 for the convention are already buzzing about the possibility of a @entity2 ticket			0
assemblyman @entity91 told @entity5 ’s @entity92 : ‘ i do n’t want to be negative , and i really hope that @entity7 wins , but @entity93 forbid , if he loses , i would love to support the governor			1
’ risky business : if he ran with @entity7 , @entity2 would have had to resigned from his governor post because of laws that do n't allow for large donations to presidential campaigns for current governors when the reporter first asked about the possible ticket , delegate @entity91 pumped his fists in the air out of excitement			1
the governor , who is known for his tough public image and short temper with off - topic reporters , took his office in 2010			2
he told @entity112 this past january that despite his list of political achievements , he still struggles daily with this weight , adding that he was working with a personal trainer several times a week and starting a diet to help trim down his waistline			0
however , it seems that the governor ’s frame has shrunk very little – if at all – since the interview last winter , an issue that @entity124 of the @entity126 ’s @entity125 said may be a hindrance for a presidential run			0
keynote : gov. @entity2 will deliver the keynote speech at the @entity64 ; he posted this picture of his and @entity7 's political buttons ahead of the event readying : a man cleans the stage inside the @entity137 before the start of the @entity64 @entity124 told @entity139 : ‘ we live in a media age in which there are these conventional expectations of what a successful individual looks like			1
the closer you comport with those kind of cultural ideas about how someone on television looks , the better you do			0
’ @entity2 ’s weight and prominent position has made him the punch line of many late - night talk show hosts , most notably @entity155			0
while hosting this year ’s the @entity159 ’s dinner , the @entity157 late night host quipped : ‘ it ’s not the @entity161			0
’ following the dinner , @entity2 returned with a retort of his own , saying that at least he got to dine next to @entity167 ’s @entity166 .			0

@entity5 governor did not want to risk leaving his job to become @entity7 's running mate , sources said
would have to *forfeit* position to receive large campaign donations from large banks and investors
will offer keynote speech at this year 's @entity64
