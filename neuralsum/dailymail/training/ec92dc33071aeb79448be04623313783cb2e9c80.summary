@entity22 and happy : @entity9 , 45 , now weighs 239 pounds , having lost almost half of his body weight in the past : at his heaviest , @entity9 weighed more than 530 pounds and wore a size @entity26 shirt ' but my weight loss journey started in september 2011 , when i was at my heaviest			1
i weighed just over 530 pounds at that point			1
' things in my life were bad , both professionally and personally , and when i was stressed i would just eat			2
' i was eating myself to death basically			2
' but when @entity9 , who previously wore shirt size @entity26 , first sought help from his doctors , the only advice he received was to ' get on a treadmill '			1
' i felt awful and i knew that i had some serious issues with my eating , ' he explained			2
' but a lot of people do n't understand food addiction			2
' doctors just told me to get on a treadmill for 30 minutes a day , like that would solve all of my problems			1
i was asking for antidepressants and that 's all they could say to me			1
' @entity9 admits that he quickly spiraled into a dangerous cycle of isolated binge eating , shutting himself off from the world completely and hiding away from people			1
' i was completely isolated for 14 hours a day , ' he said			2
' i kept myself away from everyone			2
' moving on : the weight loss guru hopes that his experiences will help others to tackle their eating issues battling addiction : @entity9 admits that it took him a long time to find anyone who could help him understand what his food addiction really meant - and claims that his doctors told him to ' get on a treadmill ' it was only when his mother stepped in that @entity9 really began receiving the help that he needed - in the form of interventionist @entity72			1

he helped me get into rehab and then afterwards i went and stayed at one of his @entity75 , where i kept on working on my diet and my fitness routine			0
' without him i would be dead			0
' now , @entity9 works alongside @entity72 helping other food addiction sufferers to work towards overcoming their illness , a struggle which @entity9 continues to face every day			1
' i share my experience with people because i want to give them hope , ' he explained			0
' i think that if they can see what i have been through and what i have achieved , then they will know that they can do it too			0
' the big thing in addiction is that you ca n't face it alone			0
you need people there to help you and support you along the way			0
' there were days when i felt like saying ' f * * * it ' , but i never gave up			0
i was so regimented in my plan and in what i was doing			0
' i wake up at 5.30am and work out , six days a week			0
working out helps me to stay clean and stay focused			0
' and while @entity9 is now ' incredibly happy ' with his life , he is still determined to lose a few more pounds - although he refuses to focus on his weight as a number , choosing instead to concentrate on what makes him feel healthy and happy			1
