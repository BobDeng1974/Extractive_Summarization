above , @entity18 is pictured at an earlier court appearance ' @entity18 was described [ by police ] as acting very much erratically and obstructively when the police were in the flat , ' he said			1
' he told the officers that his mother , who they plainly wanted to see , was at his aunt ’s property in @entity99			0
' they described him as seeming one moment as very calm and the next getting irate for no reason , claiming the police were invading his mother ’s privacy by asking about her whereabouts			0
' officers arrested @entity18 on suspicion of murder at around 5.35pm on august 13 after discovering his mother 's body in the freezer , the court heard			1
secret : mrs @entity18 's frozen body - wrapped in a sheet - was discovered by police in august , the court heard however , a post-mortem examination later revealed the elderly woman had died of natural causes			1
mr @entity53 said police had found the flat in @entity56 to be in ' a state of disarray ' - adding that it was the type of place ' one would have associated with as a hoarder '			0
' the flat contained a large amount of property cluttering up most of the space in it , ' he said			0
' it was described as typical of the type of person one would have associated with as a hoarder			0

' the freezer was described as being in working order			0
they found it was plugged in , with the power lead concealed behind various pieces of wood on the floor			0
' industrial tape was placed across the door seals , all designed to prevent the door opening accidentally			0
' when the freezer was opened , it revealed the dead body of an elderly white female dressed in her nightclothes			2
the body was described as frozen solid and was wrapped in a duvet or sheet			0
' mr @entity53 said @entity18 - who had full access to his mother 's bank accounts - had found the elderly woman dead in her bed at around the end of february or beginning of march			1
since then , he said the defendant had falsely claimed about £ 5,390 in benefits - although he had since managed to repay £ 2,000 of this			2
@entity181 , defending , said @entity18 had a history of depression and had panicked when his mother had died			2
he said his client 's primary concern was a fear that he would lose his home following his mother ’s death and he had not set out to commit fraud			0
' this is not a wicked or evil offence , it ’s an offence borne of distress , depression of an emotional breakdown , ' he said			0
sentencing @entity18 , judge @entity199 told him he believed he had acted out of an ' emotional inability to cope ' with his mother 's death			1
' it seems that you were quite unable to cope with that and in your own terms " panicked " , ' he said			0
' part of that panic you believe was a realisation that as a result you might have nowhere to live , certainly in the immediate future			0
mrs @entity18 's frozen body - still dressed in nightclothes and wrapped in a sheet - was discovered by authorities in august , @entity9 ( pictured ) heard ' what you then did was quite extraordinary and really inexcusable			1
you bundled her body , wrapped in some sort of duvet cover , into a freezer which you then taped up with industrial tape , concealed within a cardboard box and then blocked up with a mattress within the living area of that flat that you and she had occupied			0
' you told no one about it and went on claiming the benefits that she would have been entitled to and you would have been entitled to had she continued to live			0
' judge @entity228 added that @entity18 's deception over his mother 's whereabouts had been an ' aggravating ' feature in the sentence			1
' i can not overlook the fact that the vast majority of people who suffer a bereavement find themselves in a position of emotional turmoil			0
' they find it difficult to come to terms with what has happened too and do not know how best to deal with it			0
but a person 's death has to be properly and respectfully dealt with			0
' despite the mitigation in your case , the consequence must be that the public expectation is of a prison sentence			2
