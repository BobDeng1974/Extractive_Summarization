plans to hand mps an inflation - busting 11 per cent pay rise sparked a civil war in @entity5 last night , with ministers and backbenchers at loggerheads over whether to pocket the cash			2
the @entity11 , @entity13 frontbenchers and @entity14 ministers are all set to reject plans by an independent watchdog to raise their basic salary from £ 66,396 to £ 74,000 – nearly three times the average wage – from 2015			1
senior figures in all three parties branded the proposals ‘ preposterous ’ , ‘ unthinkable ’ and ‘ wholly inappropriate ’ at a time of public sector pay freezes			2
many are expected to hand the extra cash to charity			0
tension : @entity28 is among a group opposing @entity31 's suggestion to increase mps salaries to almost triple the average wage			1
but @entity34 ( right ) says it is needed to encourage people from modest backgrounds but backbench mps reacted with anger at the calls for restraint , arguing that they deserve pay rises			1
and @entity44 mps privately said they would frown on calls for restraint from ‘ millionaires in the @entity11 ’ who have their own private wealth to fall back on			1
the @entity50 , which was charged with setting mps ’ pay after the expenses scandal , will announce the pay rise on thursday			2
mps can no longer vote to block it			0
in return for the extra cash , mps will have to make higher pension contributions , bringing them in line with the rest of the public sector			0
they will see their expenses claims for dinner , taxis and tea and biscuits slashed			2
and in future , mps who walk away from @entity71 will be denied lucrative golden goodbye payments , which will be claimed only by those who are defeated at the polls			0
during @entity31 ’s consultation process over the summer , 69 per cent of @entity70 , questioned anonymously , said they deserved a pay rise			1
on average , they judged they were worth £ 86,000 a year			1
one in five wanted more than £ 95,000			2
against : chief secretary to the treasury @entity77 told @entity79 he will not take the money also unhappy : labour leader @entity81 and deputy prime minister @entity82 have also blasted the figure @entity28 , @entity82 and @entity81 all told @entity31 to change its plans			1
but it has ignored the complaints and said mps need the extra money as they have fallen behind comparable jobs in the civil service and local government			0
treasury chief secretary @entity77 told @entity93 ’s @entity92 he would not take the money – a view echoed by aides to mr @entity82 and business secretary @entity97			0
mr @entity77 said : ‘ i think it would be wholly inappropriate for mps to get such a large pay rise at a time when every other public sector worker sees their pay rises capped at 1 per cent			0
’ defence secretary @entity104 said : ‘ this is not the moment ’ for a big pay rise			0
’ @entity28 is expected to say on thursday that the @entity11 will hand the pay rise to charities and other good causes			1
labour sources said the shadow cabinet is likely to give away the extra money			0
shadow chancellor @entity114 said @entity31 appeared to have come to its conclusions ‘ entirely out of any context of the real world ’			1
several mps including shadow health secretary @entity119 and @entity14 pensions minister @entity120 said they would forego the pay rise			1
the clash has divided parliament as some mps claim they wont take it and others say they need it but a handful publicly defended the move			0
former labour home secretary @entity34 warned that failing to pay mps more would damage the diversity of the @entity131			1
‘ you will go on recruiting people of some talent who have family money or who have got many fewer family responsibilities but you wo n’t get , importantly , recruitment from people of modest backgrounds			1
’ @entity44 mp @entity141 said : ‘ it is an inconvenient truth that @entity70 ’ pay has fallen behind other equivalent occupations for some years , such as the judiciary			0
’ but there was also anger that cabinet ministers like mr @entity104 , who earns £ 134,000 a year and made millions from business , are expected to call on mps not to take their pay rise			2
one @entity44 mp said : ‘ it ’s easy for ministers to tell the rest of us not to take the money when some of them are paid more than twice what backbenchers get			0
’ sources close to @entity31 said the package would be cost - neutral , with pensions cuts paying for the higher salary			1
but short of passing a law to abolish @entity31 , it wo n’t be possible to hand back the money			2
one insider stressed : ‘ they ’ll get the money			0
what they choose to do with it is a matter for them			0

@entity11 , and leading figures in @entity13 and @entity14 set to oppose rise
@entity31 suggests increasing salary to £ 74,000 , almost triple the average wage
@entity34 claims rise needed to *attract* people from modest backgrounds
