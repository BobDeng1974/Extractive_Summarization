a newly - released video has highlighted the shocking - and arguably discriminatory - price differences between near - identical products and everyday services offered to women and men , the clip , which was created by @entity8 's @entity7 , illustrates the prevalence of this ' women 's tax ' to shocking affect by directly comparinga variety of different products and services aimed at men and women and then revealing the price differences			1
even more disappointing is that this practice of ' invisible tax ' is not only found almost everywhere , but it is entirely legal in almost every state in the @entity21 - even when the products or services are exactly the same for both genders			2
for example , a @entity45 ’s @entity44 men ’s razor was picked up for $ 8.56 , but the women 's version - the @entity49 - was , for some reason , given more than a one dollar mark - up , and was priced at $ 9.97			1
an even greater disparity was found in the perfume aisle , where @entity54 for him and for her respectively cost $ 87 and $ 106.60			0
meanwhile , a pair of @entity58 anti-aging creams with the exact same ingredients were also found to inexplicably cost women $ 1.07 more per ounce - despite the skincare brand admitting that the two products were essentially the exact same product encased in different packaging			1
one of the few equal prices found by the video 's creators was , of course , on a unisex @entity69 shirt			0
but when a man and a woman each dropped off the exact same shirt to get dry - cleaned , the woman was charged an extra 75 cents - and the tag even labelled the laundered item as a ' @entity76 '			0
something smells fishy : there is almost a ful 20 dollar difference between the his and hers versions of this brand of cologne seriously ? the presenters claim that the exact same shirt dropped off at a dry cleaners cost more to clean when a woman brought it in the two presenters do point out that conditions are getting slightly better ; medical insurance used to cost women in @entity21 $ 1 billion more each year before @entity92 outlawed the practice of gender - biased pricing discrimination			1
however , in terms of everyday gender - taxing across the country , a 1995 report found that ' gender tax ' cost women approximately $ 1,351 annually - a number which does n't show any signs of decreasing any time soon			2
and while the shocking statistics in the caused @entity105 to put a state - wide ban on the practice in 1996 , with @entity108 also opting to impose a similar ban on gender pricing , the rest of the @entity21 continues to allow the practice			1
even something as basic as long - term care insurance costs women 13 per cent more , a hike they apparently base on the fact that women have longer life - spans - in the same way that they raise rates on smokers			0
' but people choose to smoke , ' says the female presenter			0
' i did n't choose to be a woman			0

the clip , which was created by @entity128 , compares near - identical products for men and women and highlights the price differences
according to the creators of the video , @entity105 is one of the few states to have put a ban on ' gender pricing discrimination '
