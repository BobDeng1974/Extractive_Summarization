by @entity1 reporter published : 14:22 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 16:11 est , 27 november 2013 it was a fight to the death , but in this case there were two winners			0
@entity7 continued a @entity9 tradition today when he pardoned two turkeys destined for the @entity12 dinner table			1
but it was his 12 - year - old daughter @entity14 who almost stole the show today in a bold outfit including red jeans and green @entity19 boots with yellow laces			0
two birds from @entity22 , @entity23 , named popcorn and @entity25 ended up as the lucky pair pardoned by @entity7 , although only the former got to meet face - to - face with the president			1
@entity7 joked at the ceremony that his office carries many responsibilities ' but this is not one of them '			2
‘ quite literally the @entity36 , ’ joked the president			2
and while @entity39 was chosen by social media voters as the best , both birds @entity7 called the ‘ top tributes ’ will now safely live out their lives at @entity42			1
( photo by @entity74 / @entity73 ) on trend : @entity14 , 12 , almost stole the show in the dark green @entity19 boots with yellow laces ‘ even a turkey with a funny name can find a place in politics ’ the president continued as the political themed turkey came one by one			0
‘ @entity87 is already raising money for his next campaign , ’ the president said , flanked by daughters @entity14 and @entity60			0
the turkeys came from a farm in @entity22 , @entity23 , where most of the other birds will soon wind up on dinner tables			2
but thanks to a tradition begun by president @entity97 in 1963 , one bird a year has avoided that fate ever since			0
president @entity7 , with daughters @entity14 , left , and @entity60 , makes a joke during remarks at the @entity12 tradition of saving a turkey from the dinner table with a " presidential pardon , " president @entity7 , with daughters @entity14 , second from left , and @entity60 , right , stand up guy : the president took the festive opportunity of the @entity112 pardon to try his hand at comedy this year , two birds will be spared , but only popcorn has been named @entity67			1
’ he was chosen by voters on @entity119 , @entity120 , and @entity121 who hashtagged , regrammed , and ‘ liked ’ the 37 pound fowl to victory			1
‘ now , before these turkeys get away , ’ said the president , ‘ i want to grant popcorn a full reprieve			2
’ and with a wave of his executive hand , the deed was done			0
oh daddy , stop : the @entity134 cracked jokes about how much his daughters love the turkey pardon , football , and even the @entity36 ' especially at a house with two dogs ' : the comedy hits kept coming as @entity7 joked that @entity12 is a tough time for turkeys , especially at his home ' top tributes ' : the president compared the turkeys to the ' tribute ' fighters in the smash hit @entity150 and his jokes received several chuckles from the @entity9 audience brother birds : caramel and @entity127 are presented to the press one day before @entity39 was named the @entity157 thin to win : the @entity9 website has dedicated a full page to its chosen ones , brothers @entity25 , who were the top two of some 80 birds			1
the site even offers visitors the chance to listen to the unique gobble of each respective bird			0
popcorn , the lighter of the two , became the @entity172 turkey on wednesday a vision in white : popcorn , the @entity67 , from @entity22 , @entity23 stands on the @entity61 at the @entity9 in @entity62 ‘ you have a full reprieve from cranberry sauce and stuffing , ’ @entity7 said			1
‘ we ’re gon na give caramel a break as well			0
’ the two turkeys will now live out their days at @entity62 ’s estate at @entity42 , @entity185			1
they ’ll be alone , though , because all the other pardoned turkeys are dead			0
even the six pardoned by @entity7			2
something to crow about : caramel and popcorn will both survive the holiday season , and , if they are lucky , be able to live out their golden years for awhile yet settling in : one perk to being the @entity157 is the real estate ! popcorn and @entity190 will live out the remainder of their lives at @entity62 's @entity42 estate in @entity185 that ’s because the breed is n’t cut out for much besides filling up @entity56 tables and bellies on @entity203			1
‘ the bird is bred for the table , not for longevity , ’ @entity204 , who ’s in charge of livestock at @entity42 , told @entity207			2
‘ some of [ the pardoned turkeys ] have been pretty short lived			0
’ domesticated turkeys are slaughtered at after living mere months , and often ca n’t survive much longer than that when spared			0
but at least for now , @entity127 will survive to cluck another day			0
cheesing : @entity56 president @entity7 delivers remarks with his smiling daughter @entity60 before pardoning the 2013 @entity157 " popcorn " on the @entity61 of the @entity9 who are you calling a turkey ? : @entity14 strikes an intimidating pose as her father waxes presidential wednesday			1
@entity60 ( right ) took a more casual stance during the annual proceedings when all was said and done , both popcorn and his brother @entity190 were pardoned from being eaten on @entity12			1
and they wo n't be eaten next year , either , since they 'll both in all likelihood be dead candle in the wind : this turkey at a @entity234 farm wo n't be as lucky as @entity127			0
but the domesticated turkeys wo n't live long even at @entity42			2
many do n't even live as long as a year lonely at the top : popcorn may have been riding high on the horse wednesday afternoon , but he and caramel will be the only turkeys at @entity42 because all the other @entity243 have gone to turkey heaven for now , @entity127 can rest easy knowing that he 'll be well fed , protected from foxes , and admired by tourists for the rest of his days at @entity42 in @entity185			1

popcorn and his brother @entity190 will both live out their lives at @entity42 , @entity185
@entity56 voted on which of the birds they wanted as the @entity67 via @entity119 , @entity121 , and @entity120
' quite literally the @entity36 ' : @entity7 's *references* to the popular books and films were among a number of @entity12 jokes
