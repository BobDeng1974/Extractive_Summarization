an uninterrupted two - hour canal boat journey might not be the sort of thing you ’d normally sit down to watch on tv			2
but it will feature with a three - hour tour of the @entity7 and half - hour shows on traditional craftsmanship in a new @entity11 series of programmes shot in real time , designed to relax viewers			1
the concept has been inspired by ‘ slow tv ’ in @entity16 , which in recent years has included a seven - hour recording of a train journey , a five - day programme on boat travel and 12 hours on knitting			1
viewers will be able to tune in to @entity24 , a journey down one of @entity28 ’s historic waterways			0
it will feature the sights and sounds of wildlife and the tow path as the boat passes , giving facts about the canal as captions in the landscape			0
@entity7 will be a three - hour behind the scenes tour of the gallery with @entity49 – again , with no voiceover , but taking viewers from board room meetings to exhibition spaces			2
make presents three half - hour programmes showing traditional craftsmanship as skilled workers make items including a steel knife and a wooden chair			1
@entity11 channel editor @entity61 said : ‘ this surprising selection of programmes is the antithesis to the general direction much of television is going in			0
one of three programmes : @entity7 will be a three - hour behind the scenes tour of the gallery with @entity49 with no voiceover , but taking viewers from board room meetings to exhibition spaces ‘ slowing everything right down gives us the time to really observe things as they happen , and this series of programmes celebrates the simple pleasures of life in the slow lane			1
’ the reaction to the announcement of the series - called @entity11 goes slow - today on @entity83 was mixed			0
producer @entity84 joked : ' it 's only a matter of time until @entity90 commissions @entity88			0
' but @entity91 , science learning manager at the @entity92 , said : ' love that @entity61 is doing slow tv on @entity11			2
including three hours of traditional craftmanship ! ' the idea for slow tv began in @entity16 in 2009 when producers decided to broadcast the whole journey of a long train line that runs from @entity99 to @entity100 to celebrate its 100th anniversary			1
slow tv shows , which are known as ‘ @entity93 ’ in @entity16 , have also included a 134 - hour boat trip from @entity100 to @entity104 , and a 24 - hour broadcast of the first day of the salmon fishing season			1
@entity16 has attracted international attention for its series of ‘ slow tv ' programmes , including a live - broadcast of a seven - hour train journey and the knitting of a jumper			1
the concept was born on state broadcaster @entity117 ( @entity117 - which translates as @entity117 ) in 2009 with centenary of the @entity100 railway line			0
rather than commission a conventional feature programme on the line , @entity117 instead decided to put a camera on a train and broadcast the entire seven - hour trip from @entity99 to @entity100 , interweaving archive footage to liven up the programme			0
first example : the idea for slow tv began in @entity16 in 2009 when producers decided to broadcast the whole journey of a long train line that runs from @entity99 to @entity100 ( above ) to celebrate its 100th anniversary remarkably , it was a roaring success , with 1.2million viewers - about a quarter of the population of @entity16 - tuning in for at least part of the trip			1
since then , the network has broadcast a cruise journey , a fire being slowly built and burned , and more recently , the making of a jumper - starting with the sheep from which the wool came			0
last year , the tax - funded channel began the online broadcast of @entity144 , a live stream of birds and squirrels in a feeder that looks like a coffee shop			0
also last year , @entity150 announced it would make the seven - hour train journey video available to passengers on its in - flight entertainment system .			2

@entity11 goes slow series also features three - hour @entity7 tour
third programme will see half - hour shows on traditional craftsmanship
series designed to relax viewers has been inspired by ' slow tv ' in @entity16
this has included 12 hours on knitting and a seven - hour train journey
