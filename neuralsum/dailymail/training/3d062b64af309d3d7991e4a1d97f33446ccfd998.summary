by @entity0 a wealthy banker who lost a disastrous divorce battle with his fashionista ex-wife has gone back to court complaining that 's he 's been forced to quit his lavish life in @entity7			1
@entity8 , 44 , says he is being forced out of his £ 2million condo in @entity10 , @entity7 , and insists his ex-wife @entity11 , 45 , has been given an ' unfair financial advantage ' over him			1
the former @entity14 trader , who is believed to be @entity15 , was previously described by a judge as having spending power ' beyond the wildest dreams ' of his fashion writer ex. divorce battle : @entity8 ( left ) , 44 , says he is being forced out of his £ 2 million condo in @entity10 , @entity7 , after losing a disastrous divorce battle with his fashionista ex-wife @entity11 ( right ) , 45 but now , due to a divorce judge ’s ruling , he said he has undergone a drastic reversal in fortunes			1
mr @entity8 says he has been left with just a fifth of his income to survive on			1
judge @entity34 , presiding over the final hearing of the couple ’s divorce last year , ruled that the ' reasonable needs ' of mrs @entity11 and the former couple ’s children amounted to almost £ 294,000 - a - year			2
the judge had earlier said of the banker : ' the husband has been able to acquire a £ 1.9 million apartment in @entity10			1
this kind of spending ability is not within the wife ’s reach , not within her wildest dreams			0
' but mr @entity8 is now protesting at the @entity47 that he will be effectively exiled from @entity7 by @entity49 ’s order , as he can not now afford the cost of maintaining his lifestyle there			1
@entity53 heard that mr @entity8 , majority shareholder in a banking business that turned over £ 4.7 million in 2012 , had already handed his ex - who he met and married in @entity14 whilst working for @entity56 and @entity57 - £ 880,000 in assets and legal costs , prior to last year ’s hearing			1
mrs @entity11 , a ' well educated ' woman who lives on a ranch in @entity63 , which she owns , earns £ 38,000 - a - year herself , judge @entity34 found			2
mr @entity8 bought a £ 1.9m condo on @entity66 in @entity10 , but says he will now have to leave it ( file picture ) @entity8 's case is being heard at the @entity47 in the @entity70 in @entity14 her ex-husband had insisted at an earlier hearing that he was ' bust ' and ' not rich ' - despite owning a condo on @entity66 , one of @entity10 ’s most iconic addresses , along with his business interests			1
but he was found to be reaping a yearly income of more than £ 411,000 from his business by @entity49 , who went on to order him to pay the lion ’s share of that to his ex-wife and children in maintenance and expenses			0
he is now asking for permission to appeal the judge ’s order - which he says left him with less than £ 88,000 - a - year to live on , after tax			0
that is a sum on which it will be ' very difficult to survive ' in the big apple , he told @entity53			0
judge @entity34 ruled that a £ 411,000 - a - year maintenance payment , before tax , represented his ex wife ’s ' reasonable basic needs ' , and raised that figure to almost £ 294,000 when including the needs of their children			0
mr @entity8 told the appeal judge he will have to start spreading the news that he is leaving his @entity7 home if the order stands			1
he added : ' the order leaves me living in @entity7 with an amount on which it will eventually be very difficult to survive , when paying my wife more than myself			0
' insisting that @entity49 had ' made a miscalculation ' , he said : ' the award was greater for the wife when she lives in @entity116 and i live in @entity7 , where the cost of living is much higher			0
' criticising the judge , he added : ' i felt the judgment was so terrible ... the decision led to a gross financial disparity between my ex-wife and myself			0
' the judge made a calculation error which led to an unfair financial advantage for the wife			2
' @entity53 directed mr @entity8 to set out the details of his challenge in writing to his ex-wife ’s lawyers , who will then have a month to respond			2
she said she would decide after considering mrs @entity11 ’s reply whether to grant him permission to appeal			0
at an earlier hearing , mr @entity8 told the court : ' i own an apartment worth £ 1.9 million - it does n't mean i 'm rich			1
' he added : ' speculation that a turnover of £ 4.7 million would automatically translate to a large income for myself , because i own 50 per cent of the company , is just wrong ... i already have a huge amount of debt , i do n’t have any money			0
' should mr @entity8 win permission to appeal , his case will be argued before three senior judges , with his wife ’s lawyers in attendance .			2
