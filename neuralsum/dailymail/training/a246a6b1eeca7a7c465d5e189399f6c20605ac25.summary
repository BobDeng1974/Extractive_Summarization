they may look like creatures from another universe , but these multi-coloured sea slugs are in fact one of the marvels of our oceans			0
nudibranchs are soft - bodied marine molluscs that shed their shells after their larval stage , revealing their brightly - coloured exteriors			1
these stunning images were captured by wildlife photographer @entity14 in some of @entity16 's most exotic waters surrounding @entity17 , the @entity18 , @entity19 , the @entity20 and the @entity21			0
these alien - like creatures can be found in oceans all over the world nudibranchs shed their shells during the larval stage to reveal these multi-coloured exteriors it is believed the soft - bodied marine molluscs have evolved their unique anatomy to warn off predators these images were taken in waters surrounding @entity17 , the @entity18 and @entity19 , as well as the @entity20 and @entity21 the name ' nudibranchs ' derives from @entity36 and @entity37 and means ' naked gills ' the name derives from the @entity36 for naked , nudus , and the @entity37 for gills , brankhia			1
in most species the gills are prominently displayed on their dorsal surface			2
scientists believe they may have evolved such extraordinary anatomy as a form of camouflage to mimick their surroundings and avoid predators			1
another theory is that they are an example of @entity53 , an attempt to warn potential predators that they could be poisonous to eat			0
even their egg masses are often red , pink , orange or any other colour depending on the species			0
in tropical waters , beachwalkers can find nudibranchs in tidal pools at low tide			2
one theory is that the colourful exterior is a form of aposematism - a warning to predators that they could be poisonous another theory is that their bright colouring helps sea slugs blend into their surroundings wildlife photographer @entity14 travelled around the world to capture these beautiful images there are thought to be around 3,000 different species of nudibranchs in our oceans nudibranchs live on all levels of the ocean but their greatest size and variation comes in warm , shallow waters some nudibranchs have toxins which can render their predators incapacitated some species get their toxicity from the sponge they eat but others can produce it themselves another defence tactic is for nudibranchs to release acid from their skin nudibranchs are among the most beautiful and diverse creatures to be found on the planet in most species , the gills are prominently displayed on their dorsal surface some species can also release toxins which render their predators incapacitated and allow them to escape			1
others can release acid from their skin when irritated			0
there are more than 3,000 described species of nudibranchs and they occur in oceans worldwide including both tropics and @entity115			2
they can be found crawling over rocks , seaweeds , sponges , corals and many other substrates they live in all levels of saltwater but their greatest size and variation occurs in warm , shallow waters			0
sea slugs have tentacles on their heads which they use to find food and seek a mate they can be found crawling over rocks , seaweeds , sponges , corals and many other substrates sea slugs are found all over the world , including the @entity139 , the tropics and even the @entity115 nudibranchs are hermaphrodites which means that they possess both male and female sex organs even sea slug eggs can be red , pink , orange or any other colour depending on the species @entity148 can often find nudibranchs in tidal pools at low tide			1

nudibranchs are soft - bodied marine molluscs which shed their shells
name derives from @entity36 and @entity37 and means ' naked gills '
scientists believe *remarkable* colouring is a form of self - defence
