one evening i was sitting watching funny @entity55 videos when i realised there are no female pranksters			2
' it 's always the blokes like @entity1 and @entity60 getting all the limelight and making people laugh so i thought why not ? ' i started filming myself doing pranks and uploading them on my @entity12 page and within weeks i was getting thousands of views			1
' @entity6 , who does n't live with her mum but visits four times a week , admits that some of her previous tricks have been a bit harsh			1
@entity6 captures all of her videos on her mobile and uploads them to her @entity12 page ' some of the pranks i do are a bit mean , and people do tell me they are disgusted in me but i make them laugh			1

' @entity6 says that although her mum does n't always find her jokes funny she has had plenty of praise from everyone else			1
@entity6 was inspired to start filming her tricks after she realised there were very few female pranksters ' i was on a night out in @entity31 and these @entity101 guys came over and said they had seen my videos , and a couple of weeks ago i was going through a @entity104 's drive - through in @entity105 and a woman noticed me and asked if she could have a selfie with me			1

' she never shuts up and she is always winding me up			0

' @entity8 added that no matter how many pranks @entity6 plays on her she still believes everything her daughter says			1
' the awful thing is that i believe everything she says - she 's like @entity145			0
it will probably get to the point where i will have to ban her from coming to the house			0
' when @entity6 pranks me i get really annoyed and upset			2
sometimes i do feel fed up , but a couple of days after @entity6 shows me the videos and i do see the funny side and we have a laugh together			1
' @entity8 says that although @entity6 receives plenty of compliments for her videos online not everyone agrees that she is funny			1
' @entity6 tells me she gets all these comments and things on @entity12 but i do n't use social media so i do n't know what people are saying			1
' she says people find the videos hilarious , but a few of my friends think she 's disgusting			0
they say " how can you let her humiliate you like that ? " ' my younger daughter @entity38 is only ten but she 's more grown up than @entity6			2
