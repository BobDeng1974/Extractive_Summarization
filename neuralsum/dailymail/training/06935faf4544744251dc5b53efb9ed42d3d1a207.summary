@entity0 and @entity1 could yet turn out to be a match made in heaven following the @entity5 ’s shock move £ 30million move to @entity7			1
but the pair have not always seen eye - to - eye ; far from it in fact			0
from @entity13 to @entity14 , @entity1 and @entity0 have had their run - ins			1
their apparent disdain for each other even appeared to turn physical in 2011			0
here , @entity21 look at some of the incidents that ’ll need brushing under the carpet in the coming months			0
having watched @entity37 take a brutal kick to the face which resulted in a hospital visit for the @entity42 captain , it seemed @entity1 was more interested in complaining to the referee about a piece of celery thrown onto the pitch when he was taking a corner			1
then , in the midst of an injury - time melee which saw @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 sent off , the @entity5 grabbed hold of @entity54 around the neck , starting a long - running feud			0
even @entity0 ran onto the pitch to get involved			2
spark : @entity7 manager @entity0 ( third left ) raced onto the pitch during an injury - time melee involving @entity1 ( centre ) during the @entity35 final between @entity7 and @entity30 in february 2007 long - running feud : @entity1 and @entity54 ( centre left ) have had a series of scrapes august 2011 did @entity0 aim a kick at @entity1 in august 2011 during the @entity68 against @entity69 ? it looked that way			1
directly in front of the dugouts , the midfielder was scythed down by @entity75 sparking a mass brawl			0
and tv replays of the incident appear to show the then @entity69 boss aim a sly kick at @entity1 as he lie on the floor in pain			2
he did n’t look to make much contact with the midfielder			0
but he certainly made contact with with then @entity88 boss @entity87 just moments later as @entity0 poked his opposite number in the eye			1
in the aftermath @entity0 branded @entity88 a ‘ small team ’			1
did @entity0 kick him ? @entity88 players rush to confront @entity0 while @entity1 lies prostrate on the pitch not seeing eye - to - eye : @entity0 and @entity1 must now put their past grievances behind them at @entity7 february 2014 you wonder what @entity1 made of @entity0 ’s recent ‘ specialist in failure ’ comments in reference to @entity105			1
despite the fact @entity105 rejected the opportunity to re-sign @entity1 this summer , the pair maintain a close relationship			2
so how will the midfielder feel about playing for a manager who so incisively insulted a man he views as a father figure ? and then , of course , will come the first time @entity1 is asked about @entity0 ’s jibe			1
just how will he answer ? rock and hard place			0
mentor : @entity105 ( right ) has been the biggest influence on @entity1 's career and they remain close best of enemies : @entity105 and @entity0 have had a bitter rivalry ever since the @entity126 came to @entity127 february 2014 @entity1 told @entity0 to ‘ shut - up ’ earlier this year after the @entity7 manager said @entity129 would be facing ‘ the worst @entity88 for many , many years ’ in the @entity130			1
the special one claimed @entity129 would have a chance of knocking @entity88 out of the @entity130 because the @entity134 are well below their peak			0
fabregas did n’t take too kindly to the comments and after the @entity139 club won the first leg of their last - 16 tie with @entity129 2 - 0 at the @entity142 he hit back at @entity0			2
‘ some people were talking a bit too much before the game and now they have to shut up for a few days , ’ @entity1 said			0
national duty : @entity1 ( right ) closes down @entity147 ( left ) during training with @entity149 in @entity150 history : @entity136 will join his new club after the @entity153 hoping to forget moments such as this in 2007			0

@entity7 have signed former @entity30 captain fabregas from @entity88
@entity42 boss @entity0 and @entity1 have *clashed* in past
first clash took place while @entity1 was still at @entity30
relationship worsened while midfielder played for @entity88
@entity167 will now united in @entity168 next *season*
