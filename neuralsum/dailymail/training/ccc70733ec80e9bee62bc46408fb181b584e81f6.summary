by @entity0 for the @entity1 benefits for well - off pensioners should be axed to pay for radical reform of @entity7 ’s broken care system , a major report concludes today			1
they should be stripped of free prescriptions , free tv licences and the winter fuel allowance to free up billions of pounds to fund long - term care for an ageing population			2
the report , commissioned by the @entity16 think - tank , said tax rises to pay for the type of care that a ‘ decent society ’ should be providing must be targeted at the middle aged and middle class – even those who have saved all their lives to fund their retirement			1
the report also called for a ‘ review of wealth taxation , including inheritance tax , which is too frequently avoided ’			1
written by a panel headed by eminent economist dame @entity38 , it concluded @entity7 ’s current care system is in ‘ crisis ’ and is leading to ‘ injustice , unfairness and sheer distress ’ for millions			0
some are being pushed into ‘ bankruptcy ’ by the catastrophic costs they are being forced to pay			0
dame @entity38 warned that the ageing population means spending on social care as a proportion of gdp will almost double by 2025			0
‘ people say we can not afford this , ’ she said			0
‘ we have to afford this : we are not going to let people with dementia wander the streets			0
‘ if we are going to provide a decent society and decent care , we ’re going to have to find the money			0
’ the think - tank last night called on the three main parties to be open and honest about the impact of this demographic time bomb – and to put forward detailed plans by the next election			1
at present , people face having to pay full care costs if they have assets of more than £ 23,500			1
this means that tens of thousands have to sell houses each year to pay for care			0
the @entity75 is bringing in a new system imposing a cap of £ 72,000 on the amount people have to pay , with the state stepping in thereafter			1
dame @entity38 said : ‘ under our proposals , some of the extra public funding will be raised from the better - off older population , so the costs will be shared more fairly between those who develop high social care needs and those fortunate to have few or none			0
’ she said those deemed by their council to have ‘ critical ’ needs should receive free social care			0
to raise the £ 5billion a year needed to cover the cost , she outlined a range of tax rises and spending cuts			1
she suggested that , alongside a cut in the cost of a prescription from £ 8.05 to £ 2.50 , exemption from charges should be limited to the poor , meaning pensioners would lose the automatic right to free medicine			2
@entity30 would go up by 1 per cent for everyone once they turn 40 , while those earning £ 42,000 or more would face a similar hike			1
working pensioners would also pay the tax ; although at a reduced rate			1
@entity38 also called for a ‘ comprehensive review of wealth and property taxation ’			0
last night @entity114 , the government ’s @entity115 , warned : ‘ it would be dangerous in my view to extend the means - testing of pensioners because it penalises those who have saved			2
’ professor @entity120 , of @entity16 , said : ‘ the proposals may not appeal to politicians … but these issues can not simply be ignored			2
’ a government spokesman said there were no plans to change @entity30 contributions or any entitlements to benefits .			2

@entity132 said tax rises must be targeted at the middle aged and middle class
over 40s and those on over £ 42,000 should pay more national *insurance*
and pensioners who continue to work should be charged @entity30 for first time
the report was commissioned by the @entity16 think - tank
