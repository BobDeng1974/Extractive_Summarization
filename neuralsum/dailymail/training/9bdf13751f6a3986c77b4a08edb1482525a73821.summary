a senior @entity0 has attacked @entity2 's ' illegal and unworkable ' plan to force fat people to go on a diet or lose their benefits			1
@entity6 , the chair of the influential @entity7 , said she was ' infuriated ' by the proposal , announced last week			1
she has written to the prime minister to demand he drops the controversial plan			1
@entity2 has been criticised by @entity0 mp @entity6 over his plan to cut benefits for people too fat to go to work if they do n't go on a diet dr @entity6 said mr @entity2 was effectively asking doctors and nurses to break the law , because all patients had the right to refuse treatment			1
she said threatening to take away people 's basic income meant the government was forcing people to get help			1
at the moment there is no requirement on addicts to seek help before they claim sickness benefits			0
@entity2 has launched a review to see if he can change the rules			0
but mr @entity2 said people who can not work because they are too fat – or addicted to drugs or alcohol – should have their benefits cut if they refuse to get treatment			2
he pointed to @entity41 figures which show 100,000 people claim benefits for ' treatable conditions '			2
less than 2,000 are on benefits because they are too fat to work			0
but dr @entity6 , a former gp , said : ' a doctor would not only find themselves in breach of the law , they 'd find themselves at risk of being struck off			1
so in fact , his proposal is utterly unworkable in terms of the existing law			2
' government figures show 100,000 people claim benefits for ' treatable conditions ' - including around 2,000 who are too fat to work the mp for @entity65 told @entity66 that she was ' infuriated ' by the proposal which she suggested was a dog whistle to right wing voters who think everyone on benefits is lazy			1
she said : ' it 's really unnecessary and it 's all part of , in my view , trying to appeal to a sort of particular group of people who see that everybody on benefits is somehow there because it 's their own fault			1
we should n't go down this route			0
' we need to have a compassionate @entity0 message , in my view , and this is n't a compassionate @entity0 message – this is frankly illegal and unworkable			0
' dr @entity6 said the proposal was ' indefensible '			1
@entity89 , the @entity90 , has defended the proposal she called on @entity92 to issue an urgent clarification that ' there will be no enforced referrals ' of obese patients for treatment			2
the mp added : ' if you say to somebody : ' we will remove everything you have to live on unless you go to this thing ' , all you 'll have is people pitching up just to tick the box , they wo n't engage with treatment so it wo n't work , and it would count under the law as an enforced referral and it would be illegal			0
so i ca n't stress this enough , they need to withdraw it and they should do it immediately			0
' on saturday , mr @entity2 defended the plan			0
he said : ' people have problems with their weight that could be addressed , but instead a life on benefits rather than work becomes the choice			0
' it is not fair to ask hard - working taxpayers to fund the benefits of people who refuse to accept the support and treatment that could help them get back to a life of work			0
' number 10 made it clear the benefit cuts , worth about £ 100 a week , were a personal priority of the prime minister			1
work and pensions secretary @entity89 has insisted the policy does not mean taking away people 's benefits if they can not lose weight			1
speaking on the @entity140 's @entity139 show , he said : ' the problem we 've got is that lots of people are either fearful or do n't want to take the help that 's there			1
' we invest in the help , whether it 's to support people to get off drugs			2
or whether it 's to get people into a particular mindset to reduce their weight because their health condition 's so bad			2
' what we want is people to take that help and to take responsibility for their condition and try to improve			0
no one 's going to penalise anybody who tries			0
