by @entity0 immigration minister @entity1 has told an inquiry into the treatment of children in detention about the ' moral burden ' and ' emotional challenges ' of his job , but says indulging in sentiment will result in more asylum seeker deaths at sea			1
mr @entity1 made the comments during his opening statement into an @entity15 inquiry hearing into the treatment of children in detention			1
' there is much emotion in this serious topic that is before your inquiry			1
there should be , ' he told @entity15 president @entity25 in @entity26			1
' but sentiment can not be indulged at the expense of effective policy that is saving lives and ending the chaos and tragedy that was occurring			2
' he said the @entity45 people decided at the last election that enough children had drowned while seeking asylum			2
' there is no decision that i , or any of my predecessors , take as a minister in this area that is free of moral burden			2
' a group of asylum seekers are transported to @entity58 in july 2012 after their boat issued a distress signal 150 children will be released from mainland detention centres into the community			1
but approximately 700 children will remain in detention on @entity58 ( pictured ) and on @entity66 the inquiry comes as this week mr @entity1 announced that 150 children held in mainland detention centres would be released into the community on bridging visas by the end of the year			1
approximately 700 children will remain in detention centres , including those in @entity66 and on @entity58			1
concerns have been raised by refugee advocacy groups about the effect mandatory detention has on children , with allegations of physical and sexual abuse and deprivation outlined in a recent report released by the @entity15			1
however mr @entity1 said the inquiry should be investigating his @entity85 predecessors , under whose watch most of the children arrived in @entity45			2
mr @entity1 expressed disappointment the commission had not sought testimony from his four @entity85 predecessors , given more than 8,469 children arrived in @entity45 by boat during the @entity85 years			0
' i invite the commission to rectify this situation by extending an invitation to my predecessors , ' he said			0
under the @entity100 government , more children had been released from detention than put in , he said			1
he said just 353 children had arrived in @entity45 by boat since the september election , while 537 were released from detention - with the further 150 to come out in coming months			1
a drawing done by a six - year - old asylum seeker currently detained in @entity45 there have been allegations that the conditions of the detention centres could cause depression and trauma for the children prof @entity25 pressed mr @entity1 for any evidence that detaining children for long periods of time had a deterrence effect			1
' there appears to be no connection between these two , ' she said			0
people she had interviewed in mainland centres and on @entity58 had ' no idea ' of that aspect of government 's policy			0
but mr @entity1 said detention of young children was merely a consequence of the government 's policy not to allow refugees to be processed in @entity45			2
that was followed by a heated exchange about whether detention facilities employed armed guards and resembled prisons			0
prof @entity25 said there was no way into the centres except through armed guards			0
immigration department secretary @entity141 took issue , categorically denying armed guards work at the centres and calling on prof @entity25 to retract her statement			2
the commissioner then claimed conditions on @entity58 were similar to those of prisons , prompting mr @entity1 to query whether she was comparing the facility with @entity150			0
prof @entity25 said she would like to move on			0
mr @entity1 blamed the government 's lack of movement on processing tens of thousands of backlogged refugee applications on the @entity155 , which was refusing to pass the reintroduction of temporary visas			0
the government 's policy was to no longer grant permanent visas to refugees meaning there was no visa available for them , he said			0
' and the government is not going to allow a set of policies to be weakened that would see an @entity45 staring into the face of a child corpse again , ' he said			0

the immigration minister addressed the @entity15 inquiry today
he said while the subject generated ' much emotion ' , indulging in ' sentiment ' would lead to loss of life
@entity187 comes days after the *announcement* that 150 children will be released from detention centres into the community by the end of the year
