by @entity0 published : 06:40 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 06:30 est , 31 august 2013 ten members of the government missed the crunch commons vote on @entity4 – including two who were chatting nearby			0
@entity6 was under pressure to sack his chief whip sir @entity8 after a ‘ shambolic ’ operation which saw six ministers , two whips and two ministerial aides miss the vote altogether			1
they included international development secretary @entity15 and minister for africa @entity16 , who were apparently deep in conversation just yards from the @entity21 chamber while the vote was taking place			1
mps and ministers voiced astonishment at the light - touch handling of the crucial vote by @entity57 sir @entity8 – with one minister describing his approach as ‘ pretty complacent ’			1
@entity60 was also facing criticism for allowing @entity62 to make the closing speech in thursday night ’s debate			0
one @entity66 mp said : ‘ @entity62 was hopeless and ended up getting people ’s backs up rather than winning them over			0
if @entity60 had done the winding up speech i think some people would have been won round			0
’ in the aftermath of the vote , one @entity65 said : ‘ it was just shambolic			0
people are saying they ’ve hardly been spoken to , there are a lot of people who are not here			0
what have the whips been doing ? ’ @entity66 mp @entity82 , a habitual rebel , raised eyebrows in the @entity21 by revealing he had been given no instructions about how to vote on @entity4			1
' i have been under no pressure from my whip to vote one way or the other , ’ he said , although he eventually voted with the government			2
one mp said the first he knew that @entity91 was being recalled was when @entity92 sent him a text message offering him a flight home			0
‘ perhaps the @entity97 ’ office should just be franchised out to @entity92 , ’ he said			0
pressure : sir @entity8 faces being sacked as the chief whip after the prime minister suffered humiliation in the @entity21 vote shock : the @entity21 was stunned when the result was announced , inflicting an embarrassing defeat on the prime minister another mp said that although an aide to the pm had called him , presumably about @entity4 , he had left no message and never called back			1
also among those who missed the vote were @entity41 whips @entity44 and @entity42 as well as @entity41 parliamentary private secretaries @entity47 and @entity45			2
they were among 31 @entity66 and 14 @entity112 who missed the vote , despite a three - line whip being imposed			1
normally in tight votes mps are ordered back regardless of the difficulty			2
in past votes , even gravely ill mps have been wheeled into the @entity21 on trolleys			1
@entity66 : international development minister @entity37 , treasury minister @entity36 and @entity38 , minister without portfolio , all missed the vote @entity41 @entity41 : whips @entity42 and @entity44 , and pensions minister @entity39 were also absent in contrast , mr @entity36 , mr @entity37 and mr @entity39 are all understood to have been given permission to continue their holidays			2
mr @entity127 was also excused duty , as were the four other @entity41			0
a number 10 source last night defended the absences , adding : ‘ there were a number of mps who did not attend the @entity21 vote either for personal reasons or because the logistics were impossible			2
these arrangements were agreed with the @entity97 ’ @entity138			0
’ another source pointed out that the missing ministers would not have overturned @entity142 ’s majority of 13 on the key vote , but added : ‘ could more have been done ? yes it could			2
’ alarm : defence secretary @entity146 ( left ) said the @entity21 vote put the special relationship under ' strain ' while chancellor @entity150 warned @entity151 against turning its back on the world thursday night ’s defeat , which is without precedent in modern times , piles pressure on the @entity106 to replace sir @entity8 , who was brought back from retirement last year following the resignation of @entity161			1
former defence secretary @entity162 and immigration minister @entity163 have both been tipped to replace him			2
the @entity41 whipping operation was hampered by the fact their chief whip only arrived back from @entity168 on wednesday			1
many @entity41 simply ignored the three - line whip , including president @entity170 who left @entity91 shortly before the key vote took place			2
@entity173 : international development secretary @entity15 was chatting to foreign office minister @entity16 ( right ) in a small room near the @entity21 as mps voted on military action international development secretary @entity15 issued a grovelling apology to @entity6 yesterday after missing the crunch vote because she was lost in conversation in an ‘ almost soundproof ’ room with another minister			1
miss @entity15 and @entity138 minister @entity16 , were just yards away from the chamber on thursday night , and had already voted to help defeat a @entity185 pair had apparently ducked into a room for an urgent discussion about @entity188			1
despite the importance of the debate , the pair somehow contrived to miss the crunch vote in which @entity142 teamed up with @entity66 and @entity41 rebels to inflict a humiliating defeat on the prime minister			1
the pair remonstrated with speaker @entity197 , arguing that the @entity198 , which alerts mps to a vote , had not been rung			0
but mr @entity197 dismissed their complaint – pointing out there was no requirement for the bell to be rung			0
and furious commons officials yesterday insisted that the deafening bell had been rung in the corridor outside the room where the pair of ministers were chatting inside			1
extensive tests of the system yesterday confirmed it was working properly			0
hundreds of monitors displaying @entity21 business were also tested			1
a source close to @entity218 said she had apologised to mr @entity6 for her ‘ deeply unfortunate ’ absence , which was ‘ clearly embarrassing ’			0
asked about their absence , mr @entity6 said : ‘ this was a technical issue			0
‘ they had made it for the first vote , they were in a room in the @entity21 where they did n’t hear the division bell			1
‘ they have apologised profoundly , i have accepted that apology			0
it would n’t have changed the result			0
’ after voting at 10pm , miss @entity15 , 44 , and mr @entity16 , 49 , had apparently ducked into the little known ‘ @entity237 ’ just behind the @entity21 chamber for a confidential discussion			1
the next , critical , vote was scheduled for 10.15pm			0
but the pair said the tv monitor displaying commons business was turned off and they did not hear the division bell outside , or the doorkeepers outside loudly shouting ‘ division ’ to signal a vote			1
government whips apparently failed to check the room or knock on the door while rounding up mps to vote			2
the @entity237 was the scene of the famous episode in 1963 when the then minister for war @entity255 was grilled by fellow @entity112 over his relationship with @entity258			0
a @entity21 spokesman said it was a ‘ solidly constructed room with a well - fitting door ’			1
the spokesman also dismissed suggestions the pair could have missed the vote because of a failure of parliamentary systems designed to alert mps to votes			0
‘ both divisions [ votes ] proceeded as normal last night , with division bells and the usual audio / visual indications on the hundreds of monitors around the estate			1
‘ the division bells have been tested this morning and are working correctly			1
the @entity21 spokesman added : ‘ there would have been a lot of activity there around those [ meeting ] rooms			2
‘ i think it would have been clear that there had been a division on and those involved would have known there was a division on as well			0

prime minister humiliated in the @entity21 after losing by just 13 votes
8 ministers , 2 whips and 2 ministerial aides failed to turn up
@entity15 and @entity16 claim division bell did *n't* sound
but @entity21 officials hit back and say all the bells have been tested
chief whip sir @entity8 faces the sack in expected *reshuffle*
@entity151 faces ' soul - *searching* ' about role in the world , says @entity150
