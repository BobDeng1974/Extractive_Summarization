by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor veteran labour mp @entity2 was elected mp for @entity3 in 1977 but will step down at the next election a veteran @entity5 mp has claimed the ' problem ' with female politicians is that they care too much about issues which are relevant to ordinary people			1
@entity2 , the @entity5 mp for @entity3 , said the increasing number of women in the @entity13 would be ' less inclined to discuss the big issues '			1
his remarks , on the @entity16 's @entity15 this morning , sparked fury and calls for the @entity5 leader @entity19 to make it clear he disagrees			1
it comes after mr @entity2 this weekend claimed that the growing number of female mps in the @entity5 was making it too ‘ gentle ’ to wield power after the next election			1
mr @entity2 , 79 , said he was worried about the falling number of experienced men in the party because the party will be full of ‘ amenable and leadable ’ women obsessed with feminism			1
the @entity5 mp , who is stepping down at the next election , said @entity5 was becoming more ‘ family - friendly , gentler ’ but ‘ less prepared for all - night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind ’			0
speaking today , mr @entity2 attempted to explain his remarks			1
he said : ' i think the problem is simply this , that parliament with more women is going to be more anxious to discuss issues relevant to the people , that is to say family issues , social issues			2
' and less inclined to discuss big issues like should we invade @entity45			1
' but @entity47 defence minister @entity46 dismissed the remarks			0
she said : ' @entity2 ’s at it again , talking nonsense and insulting women with his absurd theories			2
to say that women do n’t care about the big issues is just not true			0
' @entity19 should make it absolutely clear he does n’t agree with @entity2 ’s ridiculous remarks			0
' mr @entity2 said the @entity57 was undergoing ‘ the biggest process of feminisation and rejuvenation embarked on since fabulous pink @entity62 soap promised to make us look a little lovelier each day ’			1
but he added : ‘ whatever the state of @entity5 ’s policies for the next election , there is little doubt that it will be fought by a younger , more attractive body of candidates			0
almost half of @entity5 's cabinet are women and @entity19 is understood to want to hit 50 per cent by the next election - up from 44 per cent today			0
@entity5 's leading women , pictured here , from left back row : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83			0
front row : @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 @entity5 introduced all women shortlists in 1993 and has since seen a surge in the number of female @entity94 - 81 out of 257			2
but mr @entity2 said all - women shortlists were being imposed on regions such as @entity97 and the @entity98 as a form of punishment ‘ for their earlier male chauvinism ’			2
he said : ‘ if @entity5 wins in 2015 , how a family - friendly , gentler party , less prepared for all - night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind , will face up to @entity47 hooligans who feel they ’ve been unjustly deprived of a power that ’s their due , is a more worrying matter			0

women @entity94 ' less inclined to discuss big issues , says @entity2
remarks on @entity114 's @entity15 dismissed as ' nonsense '
comes after mr @entity2 , 79 , said female mps were making @entity5 too ' gentle '
he said he was worried party ’s new ' *preoccupations* ' will be ' family issues '
but claimed feminisation will make @entity125 ' *brighter* , *smarter* and nicer '
