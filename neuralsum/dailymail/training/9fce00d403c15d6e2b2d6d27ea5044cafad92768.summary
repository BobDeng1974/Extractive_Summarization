by @entity0 published : 12:02 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 09:26 est , 27 august 2013 it was a renovation project which would have tested even the most established of property developers to the limit			0
but when @entity5 and @entity6 set eyes on a crumbling and long abandoned 1920s cinema , they were determined to transform it into the stunning family home of their dreams			1
and despite having no building experience , facing spiraling budgets , the stress of dealing with red tape and planning departments - not to mention bringing up two young sons - they have managed to breath new life into the impressive picture house in @entity23 , @entity24			2
it began in january 2011 when they spotted the @entity44 not far from where they were living			0
writing on their blog about the build , which chronicles the ups and downs encountered during the two and a half year project , @entity5 said : ' we ’ve lived in and around @entity68 all our lives ( give or take a few years at @entity70 etc ) , and @entity23 for the last 11 years			1
initially they hoped the site on which the decrepit cinema , and latterly an abandoned nightclub , might be the perfect spot to build a new house with a garden big enough for their two growing sons , @entity80 , eight , and @entity81 , six			0
but a brief conversation with the local planning department soon scuppered that idea			0
authorities wanted the facade of the historic 90 - year - old building preserved , but said the @entity88 @entity6 's could have free rein over the rest of the building			2
looking out the back : they managed to buy the building for £ 90,000 and set themselves a budget of £ 350,000 home cinema : they drew up plans for a striking building made out of a great deal of concrete - including concrete moulded in horizontal sections to resemble wooden boards final verdict : in july , the family moved into their home and will feature on @entity54 's latest series of @entity55 in september peeking out : the ap @entity6 's journey as they turned their derelict shell to new home will also feature in an episode of @entity54 's new series of @entity55 @entity5 , who runs a software company for schools , said : ' we have a nice home on @entity121 , but it ’s got a tiny garden , and our two lads are growing up fast			1
' we noticed that the old abandoned nightclub ( as we knew it ) was up for sale , and we enquired into the possibility of knocking it down and building a nice family home on the plot			2
' he added : ' yeah … we ’ve said to lots of people that the main reason we wanted to move from our existing house is that we wanted a bigger garden for our kids to run around in , and it ’s absolutely true ! to find ourselves doing what we ’re doing is a consequence of that one thing			0
' ' we ’ve now moved in , and gradually finishing off the details			0
it was a bit like camping for the first few days , and then stressful when you ’re trying to live normally while the builders are still in your house ! outstanding conversion : arched windows from the original facade of the cinema area a main feature in the wonderful bathroom in the @entity24 property @entity155 colours : the beautiful shower room is just one of the many renovated parts of the building , which will feature on @entity54 next month transformed : the @entity160 in @entity23 , @entity24 has been totally renovated by the @entity88 @entity6 family ' anyway , it ’s sort of settling down now , but then we ’ve got the final @entity55 filming next week , so we ’re scrambling to get everything finished			1
' they managed to buy the building for £ 90,000 and set themselves a budget of £ 350,000			1
' we knew nothing about architecture , nothing about modernism , and @entity6 wanted something traditional			0
we had never done a building project before , ' @entity5 told the @entity174			2
after engaging the services of old school friend and architect @entity177 , they drew up plans for a striking building made out of a great deal of concrete - including concrete moulded in horizontal sections to resemble wooden boards			0
sitting back : friends and family sit back and enjoy the fruits of the ap @entity28 's labour under a glass canopy door made by a company which normally fits out aircraft hangars room to grow : the ap @entity28 bought the crumbling cinema because they wanted more space and a larger back garden for their two sons to grow up in sleek : the concrete clad interior and large windows allows light to flood the building which was designed to be sleek and minimal yet family friendly renovation : the ap @entity28 bought the old cinema in @entity23 , @entity24 for £ 90,000 and after spending £ 450,000 turned it into a stunning four bedroom home among the other outlandish features in the home was a large folding glass canopy door opening over the back garden , manufactured by a company that normally makes them for aircraft hangars			1
but now , after two years of work , the brutalist inspired home has been completed - just £ 100,000 over budget			2
in july , the family moved into their home and will feature on @entity54 's latest series of @entity55 in september when presenter @entity224 will give his verdict on the finished project			1
