by @entity0 published : 20:07 est , 20 march 2012 updated : 05:59 est , 21 march 2012 @entity1 has taken a potentially decisive step towards securing the @entity4 presidential nomination by coasting to victory over @entity6 in the @entity8 primary			1
with nearly 90 per cent of the vote in , the former @entity10 governor was on 45 per cent , 12 - points ahead of his main rival , with @entity13 on eight per cent and @entity14 languishing ignominiously in fourth			0
the victory was an important one because it was in a @entity18 state , it followed a double loss to @entity6 in the @entity20 last week and it extended @entity1 ’s delegate lead making it all but mathematically impossible his rivals achieve the 1,144 needed for outright victory			1
with the @entity41 primary on saturday marking the half - way point in the @entity4 race , @entity1 has well over 500 delegates and now enters a phase when he has the opportunity to rack up some big delegate hauls			1
in a victory speech in @entity32 , @entity8 , @entity1 kept his focus on @entity34 rather than his @entity4 primary opponents			1
' three years of @entity34 have brought us fewer jobs and shrinking paychecks , but many of us believed we were in danger of losing something even more than the value of our homes and our 401 ( k ) s , ' he said			0
' after years of too many apologies and not enough jobs , historic drops in income and historic highs in gas prices , a president who does n't hesitate to use all the means necessary to force through @entity69 on the @entity71 public , but leads from behind in the world			0
it 's time to say these words , this word : enough			0
' victory lap : @entity1 celebrates with his wife @entity77 won @entity8 by a wide margin - his third big industrial state victory against @entity6 distant second : @entity6 spent the last week defending himself against gaffes and self - inflicted injuries despite big losses on @entity84 and in the @entity20 last week , @entity1 retains a massive advantage in the number of convention delegates			1
if he continues at this pace , he will reach the 1,144 needed to clinch the @entity4 presidential nomination at the @entity4 convention in august			1
( all numbers exclude tuesday 's win , which offers 59 delegates awarded by congressional district			0
) @entity1 : 522 victories : @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity10 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , the @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 @entity6 : 253 victories : @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 @entity14 : 135 victories : @entity126 and @entity127 @entity13 : 50 victories : none exit polls found that @entity1 , whose staunchest base of support was in @entity133 and its suburbs , performed well among graduates , @entity136 and voters who see the economy as the most important issue facing the country			1
in a comprehensive victory , he also had an edge over @entity6 among those describing themselves as conservative			1
only among white evangelicals and those identifying as ' very conservative ' did @entity6 , a hard - line @entity145 , prevail			2
@entity1 , the long - time party establishment favourite and undisputed frontrunner since his six - out - of - 10 victories on ' @entity84 ' this month , was helped in @entity8 by a huge spending advantage over the other candidates			2
also helping @entity1 was the belief that he has the best chance to defeat @entity34 in november			2
exit polls indicated that 60 per cent thought @entity1 was the most electable candidate , compared to 23 per cent for @entity6			1
@entity1 will take most of the 54 delegates up for grabs in @entity8			2
@entity6 was ineligible for 10 delegates because of campaign disorganisation			2
neither @entity13 nor @entity160 nor @entity161 seriously contested the state			0
before the vote @entity6 said he was hoping for a surprise victory driven by the more rural , conservative voters in the southern and western part of the state			1
that outcome , he insisted , would ' really send shockwaves ' through the @entity4 establishment			2
he held four rallies and conducted 19 interviews in @entity8 on voting day in a last - ditch effort to boost turnout among his downstate supporters before heading to his home state of @entity178 , which votes on april 24			0
key win : while @entity1 's victory in @entity8 will not end the @entity4 primary , his wide margin has greatly bolstered his status as front - runner all eyes on @entity8 : the primary in the heavily - @entity39 state boiled down to a contest between @entity1 and @entity6 acknowledging defeat , @entity6 was notably less combative in attacking @entity1 , perhaps a sign that he was beginning to accept that his rival would be the party ’s nominee			1
he touted his blue - collar roots , contrasting them with @entity1 ’s @entity195 credentials			0
' i learned everything about freedom and opportunity and hard work growing up with folks who worked in the mills and mines , ' he said			0
vowing to stay in the race , he told his supporters to ' saddle up like @entity206 did in the cowboy movies , ' reassuring them it would be ' five weeks to a big win and a big delegate sweep in @entity178			0
' as well as @entity178 , @entity6 expects to win in the @entity41 and then @entity211 and @entity212 on may 22			0
he has also set his sights on a big win in @entity215 , which offers 155 delegates and which holds a primary on may 29			0
but in the short term , @entity1 hopes to score april wins in the @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226			0
a @entity1 win in @entity178 could seal @entity6 ’s fate .			1

@entity1 's lead now more than double of nearest rival @entity6
all but mathematically impossible for @entity4 rivals to achieve outright victory
