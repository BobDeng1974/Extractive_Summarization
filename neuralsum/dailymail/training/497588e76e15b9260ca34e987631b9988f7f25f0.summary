by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 28 march 2012 updated : 19:21 est , 28 march 2012 baffled : dr @entity1 emailed prayer by @entity3 , founder of the @entity4 , to colleagues a @entity7 doctor went to an employment tribunal yesterday claiming he was sacked because he emailed a prayer to his colleagues			1
@entity1 , 64 , qualified 40 years ago and rose to become clinical director at the hospital where he worked			2
but he said he was dismissed after failing to accept an order to ‘ refrain from using religious references in his professional communications , verbal or written ’			0
dr @entity1 accepts that he emailed a prayer by @entity3 , the 16th century founder of the @entity4 , to colleagues at @entity21 three years ago to try to motivate the department			1
he said he prefaced it with the words : ‘ i find this a personal inspiration in my frail imperfect efforts to serve my patients , their families and our department			0
’ he said the email was welcomed by his colleagues			2
but he was later accused of sending an ‘ unwelcome ’ text message to a colleague on christmas day wishing him a ‘ peaceful @entity35 ’			1
the colleague , @entity37 , replied with the word ‘ likewise ’ , but a report by the hospital said : ‘ while @entity44 ( @entity1 ) may regard such messages as benign , @entity36 ( @entity37 ) perceived them as aggressive and unwelcome intrusions into his private time			2
’ dr @entity1 told the @entity47 tribunal the hospital trust never clarified why it told him not to use religious language at work , and that it was unable to provide further examples of his use of such phrases			1
he said : ‘ the allegation that i have forced my religion on to other people , that i am some kind of religious maniac , was made worse by the fact that they told me there was no need to understand what this is all about			0
’ to give and not to count the cost : the prayer by @entity3 , founder of the @entity68 order , sent by dr @entity1 to his colleagues the tribunal heard his problems began after he raised concerns over a consultant who let a child with suspicious injuries go home , despite ‘ serial warnings from other staff ’			1
the child was killed a week later by his stepfather , who later admitted manslaughter			0
in 2008 dr @entity1 was stripped of his position as clinical director as a result of the dispute about the competence of the child ’s consultant			1
he was made aware of two incidents in 2009 when children were allegedly sexually assaulted by adult patients allowed to use ‘ washing and toilet facilities ’ on the children ’s ward			0
he said he wrote to the divisional director over the matter but ‘ never had a satisfactory answer ’			0
he was suspended for six weeks in 2009 after complaining about a ‘ very rude nurse ’			0
unfair : dr @entity1 went to tribunal after he became deeply concerned about practices at @entity21 in 2008 after his text to dr @entity37 that december , @entity101 set up an independent review which told him to stop making religious references			1
dr @entity1 , who lives in @entity105 with his wife @entity106 , 61 , and attends a baptist church , was finally dismissed three days before christmas 2010 after a disciplinary hearing			2
the hospital cited a breakdown in trust			0

dr @entity1 emailed prayer by @entity3 , founder of the @entity4 , to colleagues for motivation
