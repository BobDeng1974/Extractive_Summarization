@entity1 's shadow business secretary said @entity3 workers needed to be as productive as the @entity4 @entity3 's economy needs to become more like @entity4 because its workers are ' more productive ' , shadow business secretary @entity5 said			1
the rising @entity1 star said @entity3 workers took five days to what the @entity4 did in four			1
mr @entity5 's remarks come just days after a leading investment bank warned that the @entity3 economy under @entity1 would ' look increasingly like @entity4 ' , where growth is almost non-existent but , mr @entity5 told the today programme on @entity16 : ' the issue is n't just that we have more employment but the nature of the work			1
' too much of our work is low paid , it is n't secure , we do n't have high skilled jobs			0
we have got to deal with the productivity problem in this country			0
' it takes on average a @entity3 worker to friday to do what equivalent workers in @entity31 and @entity4 will complete by the end of thursday afternoon			1
' the way we deal with that is ensuring people have more skills			0
they are actually more productive than us			0
' people can say what they want about @entity4 but ultimately coming back to the @entity3 we have got to be more productive			2
' mr @entity5 was speaking this morning ahead of a major speech on @entity1 's plans for the economy by @entity44			1
a spokesman for the @entity1 shadow minister insisted he was not suggesting @entity3 should copy the @entity4 economic model			1
he said : ' @entity5 was simply making the observation that despite our many strengths , compared with other major @entity52 economies @entity3 lags behind our competitors on productivity			2
' that ’s why today @entity1 is launching its better plan for prosperity to boost the number of better - paid , high skilled jobs			0
' but mr @entity5 's remarks come just days after the @entity61 suggested that @entity1 's economic plans could lead to lower growth and seriously damage investor confidence in the @entity3			1
in a devastating assessment , it said : ' a left - wing coalition around @entity1 , would , in our view , continue to deliver on fiscal austerity , albeit a milder version than the @entity72 , with the accompanying cyclical headwind that this entails , while embarking on structural changes which could in the medium run reduce the appeal of the @entity3 as a business location and trigger , ultimately , a deterioration in potential gdp growth			2
' it added : ' in a nutshell , the @entity3 would look increasingly like @entity4			2
' the warning is acutely embarrassing for mr @entity44 , who cosied up to @entity4 's socialist president @entity84 after his 2012 victory			1
at the time , mr @entity44 said the two men were ' in agreement ' on the economy , and suggested he was looking to replicate the @entity4 anti-austerity programme			2
mr @entity84 's policies , including a 75 per cent top tax rate , have proved a disaster			1
@entity4 president @entity84 has seen his popularity plummet as the economy has stalled economic growth in the final quarter was 0.1 per cent in @entity4 , compared with 0.5 per cent in the @entity3			1
unemployment is 9.9 per cent – way above the 5.8 per cent in the @entity3			0
the @entity100 report warned that mr @entity44 is likely to ' seriously interfere with the private sector ' , adding that , with the public finances still in a mess , @entity1 may revert to bashing business in order to fund its pledges			0
' if a centre - left government can not tackle inequality through social transfers , it will be tempted to focus on fighting ' primary inequality ' , for instance by imposing a massive increase in the minimum wage , ' said the report			0
' in our estimates , @entity1 's pledge to bring this to £ 8 per hour would put the @entity3 at the level where @entity4 is , in terms of distance from the median wage			1
're - regulation of working contracts and working time would also be likely			0
the ' energy price freeze ' – mooted by @entity1 last year – and the proposals to introduce a market share cap in the banking sector are other examples of interference with the private sector			0
' @entity134 chairman @entity133 said the report underlined the threat posed by @entity1			0
' @entity1 have no plan for the economy , other than more spending , more borrowing and more taxes , ' he said			0
' the choice is clear – between a competent @entity134 government working through its long - term economic plan and the chaos of @entity1 with @entity44 and @entity146			2

@entity5 said @entity4 workers were more productive than in the @entity3
he said @entity4 workers produce as much in four days as @entity3 staff do in five
comes days after a top bank said @entity1 would make @entity3 more like @entity4
banks of @entity155 said @entity44 's policies would *hit* economic growth
@entity3 economy growing 5 times *faster* than @entity4 's with half the *jobless* rate
