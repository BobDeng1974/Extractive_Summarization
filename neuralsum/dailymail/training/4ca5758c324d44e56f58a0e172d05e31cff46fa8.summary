by @entity0 the @entity2 is preparing to axe one of its main tv channels to help it find another £ 100million in savings , insiders have said			1
in a dramatic concession to those who accuse the corporation of being too large and unwieldy , director general @entity6 is expected to jettison @entity10 or @entity11 entirely			1
although the plans have been kept secret while he consults with a team of advisers , the @entity2 will formally announce the cut in the next month			2
salami slicing : @entity6 has said he does not want cuts to happen in dribs and drabs it would be one of the biggest shake - ups of the corporation in recent years , and is likely to provoke a wave of protest from viewers			1
@entity6 has refused to give any details but has hinted strongly that he will make a single dramatic cut rather than trim each department ’s budget			2
speaking at the @entity31 this week , he said he was prepared to make a ‘ hard decision ’ rather than see any reduction in the @entity2 ’s drama budget			2
he said : ‘ we decided we ’d reached the point where salami - slicing would affect quality and distinctiveness			2
rather than seek to preserve a less good version of our past , we decided to focus on what we do best : from drama to taking @entity44 into the next generation			0
’ @entity6 said the @entity2 needs to deliver an additional £ 100million of savings			1
it is still only halfway through the £ 700million programme of cuts – known as @entity50 – which was set up by former director general @entity51			1
debate : @entity53 has said high - brow @entity11 should merge with @entity54 because they are similar it could cut any one of its major services or channels , with the @entity59 a potential target			1
but several senior @entity2 insiders said the axe is most likely to fall on either its youth channel @entity10 or the high - brow @entity11			1
one source told the @entity65 : ‘ @entity6 is keeping his cards close to his chest … but we all expect him to cut down the number of tv channels			2
it does n’t make any sense having so many platforms , and we ca n’t keep on cutting other budgets			0
’ in recent months , a series of senior @entity2 figures have publicly called for the corporation to be slimmed down			0
in november last year , veteran presenter @entity53 suggested @entity11 should be merged with @entity54 , with the ‘ gardening and the cookery ’ replaced by quality arts programmes and documentaries			1
former @entity2 chairman @entity82 , who has said the distinction between the channels is ‘ very blurred indeed ’			0
ca n't get her out of our heads : the @entity2 is having at least one major success with @entity88 last month @entity54 and @entity11 controller @entity89 announced she was stepping down from her role to concentrate on running ‘ special projects and seasons ’			1
the stations are yet to find a new controller			0
once it announces which channel it will cut , the @entity2 will have to put the proposal to the @entity98 , which would then have to put the plans through a lengthy public consultation			0
the cumbersome process could prove to be a stumbling block for @entity6 ’s plan			0
in 2010 , the @entity2 was forced into a u-turn after its plan to axe @entity106 backfired			0
the @entity98 revoked the decision after a wave of protests from listeners			0
÷ the @entity2 has bought around £ 2.5million worth of @entity111 , @entity112 and macbooks for staff in the past two years ,			1
they bought 4,266 iphones , 427 @entity112 and 815 macbooks between january 2012 and october 2013 according to figures released under @entity119			0
in addition , they are thought to have spent tens of thousands of pounds training staff how to use the gadgets .			0

director general @entity6 said he does not want *gradual* ' salami slicing '
@entity2 is only halfway through its £ 700m cuts programme from *government*
@entity53 has already said @entity54 and @entity11 should merge
