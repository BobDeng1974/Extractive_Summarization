by @entity0 what a difference a year makes			0
at the beginning of april last year , sir @entity3 ’s @entity2 headed into the derby at @entity6 15 points clear of @entity8			1
on tuesday evening , it is @entity11 ’s city who will stroll into their neighbours ’ backyard with a strut of arrogance , knowing @entity2 ’s status has been diminished to that of inferiors			0
this time it is they who sit in the ascendency , 12 points ahead of @entity24 ’ ailing side			2
a win would convert 12 into 15			0
damning : our graphic shows years of @entity2 dominance , with the difference in points between the two sides going into @entity6 derbies heavily in their favour , but the pendulum appears to have swung bubble 's burst : @entity24 will be desperate to beat @entity8 at @entity6 on tuesday night saviour ? @entity39 scores his wonder goal against @entity41 last weekend focus : @entity8 's players look fired up in their training session ahead of the derby at @entity6 two more victories in @entity8 ’s games in hand on @entity2 and the gap would become 21			1
it is a prospect barely worth thinking about for those at @entity6 , offering a frightening snapshot of just how far @entity2 have plummeted in the @entity54 era			2
yet there would also be little surprise if @entity2 were to surrender once more			0
after all , they have won just one match in 12 against the top nine in the @entity59 this season , losing seven of those			0
it is not difficult to see , therefore , why @entity8 are the bookmakers ’ favourites to win a match at @entity6 for the first time since the inception of the @entity59			1
city have inflicted the odd flesh wound in the past , of course			0
@entity70 ’s side , with @entity71 up front rather than @entity74 , as the main man beat @entity2 4 - 1 at the @entity73 in 2004			1
more cuttingly , there was that 6 - 1 two years ago at @entity6 , leaving @entity3 ‘ shattered ’ after the ‘ worst result in my history , ever ’			1
and then there was the last - gasp @entity74 goal to snatch the title from @entity2 in the most dramatic manner possible			2
these were body - blows to the @entity2 system but they were swiftly corrected , first through the signing of @entity85 , ahead of @entity8 , and then by reclaiming the title in @entity3 ’s final season			1
@entity87 ? @entity88 scores for @entity8 in the 3 - 1 win at @entity90 in 2002 unprecedented : @entity91 celebrates back in 2004 during the 4 - 1 rout of their rivals old rivalry : city fans goad then opposition manager sir @entity3 in the 2004 victory it 's been 44 years since @entity8 beat @entity2 in three consecutive league matches			1
@entity8 could break this run if they win at @entity6 on wednesday			1
the @entity101 won 2 - 1 at @entity6 last april before battering @entity24 ' side 4 - 1 in his first derby at the @entity73 in september			1
so , can they make it three on the bounce once again ? it is a very long time indeed since @entity2 were last unequivocally considered the weaker force in @entity109 and that should be a serious concern within the walls of @entity6			2
certainly , it has never been the case in the @entity59 era			0
indeed , only twice before have @entity2 entered a @entity109 derby at home in the @entity59 trailing @entity8 on points			1
before the 6 - 1 in 2012 , @entity8 were two points ahead of @entity3 ’s side but that was after just eight games			1
the only other occasion was an anomaly , in september 2005 , when @entity2 were one point behind @entity125 ’s @entity8			2
@entity8 had played four games to @entity2 three , meaning that particular statistic was rather skewed			2
another rout : @entity8 hammered @entity2 at the @entity73 earlier this season with @entity74 scoring not you again : @entity74 struck the winner at @entity6 last season with a powerful effort after a nice run relief for @entity2 : @entity74 has been ruled out of tuesday 's derby with a hamstring injury the turnaround can perhaps be more readily attributed to @entity2 ’s decline than @entity8 ’s development in this past year			1
intriguingly , for all the calmness instilled by their phlegmatic manager , @entity8 are only four points better off than they were after 28 games last season			0
@entity2 , by contrast , are 26 points worse off than they were at the same stage last season			0
all things considered , it does not require much this season to be more formidable than @entity24 ’ side			0
big - game player : @entity154 has been in exceptional form of late for @entity8 unstoppable : rooney scores a tremendous overhead kick against @entity8 in 2011 tormentor : @entity39 has a penchant for scoring against @entity8 in @entity109 derbies but we should not forget that is new territory for @entity8 supporters , for the first time indisputably the dominant outfit			2
previously , this would be the stuff of printed t - shirts			0
now , it is par for the course			0
this can be rammed home if @entity11 ’s side secure a third consecutive league victory at @entity6 on tuesday night			0
that has not happened for more than 40 years , when @entity8 won five games in a row at the home of @entity2 between 1967 and 1972			2
another enemy : @entity178 celebrates after scoring against @entity2 sore sight : @entity180 netted @entity182 's third at @entity6 on a dismal day for @entity2 fans it would be the latest of a succession of records to topple under @entity24 and fresh on the back of a 3 - 0 humiliation by @entity182 , defeat against @entity8 would provide compelling evidence that the tide has turned irretrievably in @entity109			1
dropping below @entity8 or @entity182 is one thing , to fall below the two is another thing entirely			0
but that is the unacceptable reality that the rank - and - file at @entity6 may be just obliged to accept come tuesday evening at @entity197			0
@entity199 era : @entity200 ( left ) was part of a @entity8 team that dominated @entity2 for a period glory days : city fans run on the pitch at @entity6 in 1974 after @entity207 's goal relegated @entity2			1

if @entity8 beat @entity2 at @entity6 they will widen gap to 15 points
first time in @entity59 that @entity8 are bookies ' favourites at @entity6
@entity24 desperate to win to atone for 4 - 1 thumping at @entity73
