by @entity0 a photographer whose stark portrayal of a little girl 's life surrounded by her poverty - stricken parents life of drug and alcohol abuse has defended her decision not to report them to authorities			1
@entity13 's photo - essay entitled ' @entity14 ' sparked national outrage when its portrayal of two @entity18 's addicts seemingly oblivious to their two - year - old girl , @entity19 , was shared widely online			1
parents @entity20 and @entity22 were captured living a raucous life of drug - fueled partying - while their daughter was allowed to wander to the ledge of an open window , play with their cigarettes and come face - to - face with her strung - out father 's genitals while he slept - off his latest binge			1
ragers : @entity22 and a friend partying , with @entity19 in the foreground when the photographs were exhibited in @entity18 they were nominated for awards , but when the images made it online they almost sparked an official police investigation and a campaign was started to get @entity19 away from @entity20 and @entity22 and put into an orphanage			1
@entity46 was mostly directed towards @entity13 , who was 21 when she took the photographs in 2008 , for not intervening			2
she was labeled an opportunist for taking advantage of the drug - addicts and for not alerting anyone in a position of authority			1
' i could n’t imagine the reactions at all , ' @entity13 said about the backlash against her			0
' maybe it ’s weird , but my intention was to talk about the possibilities of love on the margins of society , and i hoped to bring more understanding , to build a bridge between people and to raise awareness that bringing up a child is not an easy task			0
' @entity13 claimed that the negative reaction was startling to her , because she claims that what is portrayed in the photographs was not the whole truth of @entity19 's life			0
danger : @entity19 comes perilously close to the window ledge in her parents @entity18 apartment - what is not totally clear is a safety net that is under the ledge sleeping it off : @entity19 plays with cigarettes while her mother lies to the images left she claims that the startling images are just that and do not represent the ability of @entity22 and @entity20 to raise their daughter			1
' the truth is that life is complex and there are many situations too complicated to be judged , ' she said			0
' i thought it was important to make people think more about the level of truth which they usually do n’t want to think about			0
' the project began when @entity13 traveled to @entity18 with the intention of creating a photographic essay about ' feelings '			1
beginnings : @entity13 found @entity20 on the streets of @entity18 with @entity104 in her stroller back to the apartment : @entity104 stands in front of her parents @entity20 and @entity22 at their home in @entity18 parents : @entity20 and @entity22 pose in a picture from @entity13 who published her photographic essay ' another family ' to huge scorn after a failed attempt to capture what she wanted at a nightclub , she spotted a woman urinating in the street at 2am as she pushed her child along in a stroller			1
the woman was @entity20 and @entity13 asked if she could take photograph			0
she ended up asking @entity13 is she wanted to come back to her apartment to take more pictures			2
there @entity13 discovered a single room apartment that had a communal kitchen and bathroom			0
she moved in for two weeks and began taking pictures			2
@entity13 witnessed the drugs and the booze and among all this , @entity19 crawling around , apparently left to her own devices			2
on the street : @entity20 and her mother meet with friends out and about in @entity18 cute : @entity139 , @entity22 tickles the feet of his daughter @entity104 in one of @entity13 's revealing portraits @entity20 and @entity22 had an argument about the money on the street			1
they went in different directions , but at the last moment , they both looked back @entity20 and @entity22 even came to the unveiling of the pictures at the @entity18 gallery before they caused such a commotion online			1
without access to the @entity156 , @entity13 felt she owed it to them to explain - especially after the police began asking her for their address			2
@entity22 became angry at @entity13 because of the brush with the law and now refuses to speak to her			0
@entity20 was relaxed - but six months after the controversy in 2012 she disappeared - leaving @entity19 with her father			0
she sought treatment for her addictions and is no longer with @entity22 and works in a @entity18 clothe shop			0
@entity22 now works part - time as an electrician while he looks after his daughter with his new partner and her son			0
@entity19 is attending school and is still called ' princess ' by her father			0
stable : @entity104 was not taken from her parents and is seen her attending kindergarten and her parents are seeking treatment for their addictions			1
