we had a big fight , right in front of the theater			0
' ' that was not [ @entity14 ] , ” @entity5 admitted to @entity70 for the new biography			1
“ that was an example of compression ... i thought that [ the anecdote involving the reaction of a white girlfriend to the angry black play ] was a useful theme to make about sort of the interactions that i had in the relationships with white girlfriends			2

they broke up and in her diary she claims he was too cold and not giving her the level of emotional involvement that she needed in an entry from may 1985 she writes : ' now , at this point , i 'm left wondering if @entity5 's reserve , etc. is not just the time in his life , but , after all , emotional scarring that will make it difficult for him to get involved even after he 's sorted his life through with age and experience			2
' of the breakup she wrote , ' i was not the person that brought infatuation			0
( that lithe , bubbly , strong black lady is waiting somewhere ! ) ' mr @entity5 went on to marry his wife @entity261 in 1992 and have two children with her			2
