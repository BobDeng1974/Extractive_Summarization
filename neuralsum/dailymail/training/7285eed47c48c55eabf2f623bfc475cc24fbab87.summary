by @entity0 and @entity1 tens of thousands of pupils in primary schools will be served reheated meals or cold sandwiches as a result of @entity9 ’s controversial free lunches policy			1
under the plan , all primaries will need to provide free lunches to all four - to seven - year - olds from september			1
but half say they are not ready and still need kitchen upgrades , serving or dining facilities in order to meet the pledge			1
@entity9 's plan to offer lunches to primary school children has hit fresh trouble after half of schools said they still are not ready to make the meals some renovations will over-run , forcing schools to use stop - gap measures such as bussed - in packed lunches , councils admit			1
and more than 3,100 primaries – one in five – say they will definitely be unable to offer traditional cooked lunches because they lack proper kitchens and can not afford them			1
they will be forced to buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep the lunches warm or heat them up – in some cases with a microwave – on site in mini-kitchens			0
other schools say they will not even be able to do that – with dozens insisting they will be able to offer only a cold packed lunch			1
in some cases the pupils will have to eat sandwiches at a desk because there is not enough space for all the children to eat together			0
and some headteachers said they were going to have to start lunch breaks at 11.30am in order to push through large numbers			0
the figures – revealed in a @entity61 – show mr @entity9 ’s free school meals policy is in chaos with just two months to go			1
one councillor – where ten primary schools have had to be renovated at a cost of £ 1.8million – said she was ‘ shaking with rage ’			1
@entity69 , @entity70 head of education , said the authority was receiving only £ 1.2million from the government towards costs			0
she said the policy was dreamed up on the ‘ back of a fag packet ’ for mr @entity9 ’s ‘ moment in the limelight ’ , leaving many in education ‘ running round like headless chickens ’			1
‘ they are not providing us with enough money , ’ she said			0
‘ we are about half a million short , which is going to come from the @entity87 money could be going to disadvantaged children			0
it makes me so angry			0
i shake with rage when i think about it			0
’ mr @entity9 said he would demand a ‘ hot , healthy lunch ’ for infant school pupils every day			2
but following warnings from headteachers that his policy was not properly funded , references to ‘ hot ’ were quietly dropped from legislation published earlier this year			0
half of schools say they are still waiting for kitchen or service upgrades before they can give out the lunches , while 3,100 schools say they will definitely not be able to fulfil the pledge as they can not afford the equipment the figures were requested by the @entity111 from 150 education authorities			1
seventy - one responded and supplied figures on the type of provision to be offered in their schools			0
this revealed that 1,350 out of 7,083 primaries plan to fulfil the duty by transporting in hot food			2
further figures from 67 councils show that 3,051 out of 6,144 schools – 49.7 per cent – still need improvements to kitchen , dining or serving facilities to meet the deadline			1
this suggests that nearly 8,100 schools are carrying out urgent upgrades			2
schools struggling to implement reforms have been advised to consider kitchen ‘ pods ’ dropped in by crane			2
a @entity140 spokesperson said : ' we have contacted every local authority as well as hundreds of academies and based on their responses the overwhelming majority of schools are on track to deliver this policy in september and we are confident it will be delivered on time			2
' @entity152 free school meals have already been shown to work in the pilot schemes run by the @entity140 and @entity154 between 2009 and 2011			0
indeed , schools have had longer to prepare for the introduction of universal infant free school meals this september than schools in those pilot areas had			2
some schools , as now , may choose to transport in food that has been prepared elsewhere			0
' we are providing £ 150 million to improve kitchens and dining facilities , an additional £ 22.5 million to help smaller schools to provide these meals and a free support service staffed by food experts for schools			1
' if hot meals can not be provided schools would be expected to work towards offering them ‘ as soon as possible ’ .			0

primary schools must offer free lunches next term under @entity9 's plan
but half say they are not ready as kitchen facilities still need upgrades
3,100 schools say they wo *n't* fulfil pledge as they can not afford equipment
councillor *claims* policy was dreamed up on the ' back of a fag packet '
