@entity0 enhanced his reputation as one of @entity4 's top young goalkeepers with a clean sheet on tuesday night as @entity6 defeated @entity7			1
@entity0 , standing in for the injured @entity8 , joined the likes of @entity10 and @entity11 in a star - studded line - up for the world champions			0
but his professional career had a far more humble beginning			0
@entity0 , now 25 , could not keep out @entity27 that day as he did the @entity29 champions in @entity30			1
@entity22 lost 2 - 0 in front of a crowd of 4,528 , with former @entity34 midfielder @entity33 and now - @entity36 striker @entity35 getting the better of the man on loan from @entity39			2
@entity7 started with @entity41 striker @entity40 up front on tuesday night , but five and a half years ago it was a strikeforce of an ageing @entity45 and now - @entity47 captain @entity46 that proved too much for @entity22 and @entity0			1
@entity0 challenges @entity27 's @entity48 - now at @entity49 - on his debut for @entity22 in february 2009 the @entity6 goalkeeper prepares to clear the ball at @entity21 as the @entity53 slipped to a 2 - 0 defeat that was one of only two senior appearances @entity0 would make in a frustrating five - year spell in @entity59 , with the second coming just three days later in a 1 - 1 draw at @entity61 as now - @entity63 captain @entity62 headed past him for the home side 's equaliser			1
@entity0 moved to @entity39 as a 16 - year - old from @entity67 in july 2005 with a burgeoning reputation following some star performances for @entity6 's youth teams			1
he left five years later with that reputation seemingly in tatters , having spent most of his last season at @entity74 warming the bench for @entity39 's reserve side			0
@entity0 signs for @entity39 alongside sir @entity77 in 2005			2
he did not make an appearance for the club @entity0 was tipped for big things when he joined @entity39 as a 16 - year - old from @entity67 four years on though and @entity0 now has a @entity84 winners ' medal - although he did not play in @entity85 he was in @entity87 's squad , as he was for @entity88 - and four caps for his country			2
@entity0 joined @entity17 on a free transfer in the summer of 2010 , made his first - team debut in january 2011 and has not missed a @entity94 game since , racking up 128 consecutive appearances and establishing himself as one of the best goalkeepers in @entity6 , if not @entity4			1
the 6ft 1in stopper has been heavily linked with a move to @entity100 to replace their ageing no 1 @entity102 , who @entity0 has now usurped as @entity8 's deputy			0
the goalkeeper celebrates @entity6 's @entity84 triumph in @entity106 back in july @entity0 barks orders at his defence as he keeps a clean sheet against @entity7 in @entity30 on tuesday night at 28 , @entity8 - undisputedly world 's best goalkeeper - has plenty of years left in him but @entity0 too looks set to be a part of the @entity115 set - up for a long time to come			1
it is remarkable to think not only that he could not get a look - in at @entity39 , but that he played just twice for @entity118 's @entity22 in a three - month loan spell with the @entity121 club			2
@entity22 would be relegated at the end of the 2008 - 09 season and the man who kept @entity0 out of the side , @entity124 , is now plying his trade with @entity127 in @entity128			0
@entity129 are 10th in the bottom tier while @entity22 are 17th			0
it looks like @entity0 has had the last laugh			0
@entity0 in action against @entity100 as @entity124 ( right ) takes on former club @entity22 for @entity129			0
