@entity0 were condemned to a black - wash at the end of a shattering season as a searing first - half blitz from @entity5 left them in a state of disarray and there was no way back			1
@entity11 was the executioner - in - chief with a glorious hat - trick of tries , but his exploits were aided by the visitors ’ failings			1
this was a game too far			0
this was the occasion when the wheels came off for an extended spell and a tour that had given such cause for long - term optimism appeared in danger of ending in humiliation			0
ultimately , their fate was not as grisly as it may have been , but it was a miserable occasion nonetheless			0
at half - time , @entity0 were 23 points adrift on the scoreboard			1
they had conceded four tries as their defence was systematically dismantled by the rampant world champions			0
such was the extent of the carnage ; it looked as if the tourists ’ fabled collective spirit had been left utterly broken			0
@entity41 complete series whitewash hat - trick hero : @entity11 races through to complete a 36 - 13 victory for @entity5 in third test different class : @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 celebrate during @entity41 's third victory marched : @entity52 walks off the field after being shown a yellow card in @entity0 's 36 - 13 third @entity55 lost that notion was dispelled by a determined revival after half - time , but the improvement in the performance did not equate to enough points to turn the contest on its head			1
the @entity5 were not able to maintain their imperious standards , but they had already re-asserted their supremacy en route to claiming a 3 - 0 series win			1
@entity0 will point to the close results in @entity70 and @entity71 as evidence that they have made strides on this trip , but in truth they will fly home with more confusion than clarity			2
there is still no sign of the coaches being absolutely certain about their best line - up – with particular doubts about the midfield and wing selections			0
the first half was arguably the worst 40 - minute period of @entity88 ’s tenure – perhaps even more abject than the second - half collapse in @entity90 last year			1
rarely have his @entity0 team so meekly succumbed to an avalanche of pressure			2
even when they were pounded by the @entity96 in @entity97 two years ago , the brutal mis - match did n’t last so long			0
four tries before the break was n’t even a sufficient illustration of @entity5 ’s utter dominance			1
questions : @entity103 is helpless as @entity11 scores a try during the tour that disappointed brace : @entity11 scored two tries as @entity108 raced to a 29 - 6 half - time lead @entity111 : @entity5 completed a test whitewash and equalled their record of 17 consecutive @entity55 wins @entity11 is becoming the man focal point for @entity119 nightmares with his scoring feats in this fixture			1
the @entity5 wing had touched down five times in three previous matches against @entity88 ’s side and he continued his solo onslaught within four minutes here			1
from a lineout on the right , the hosts sent the ball in - field at pace to @entity50 , who passed on to @entity133 – the hero of the victory in @entity71 last weekend			0
the full back twisted past an isolated @entity136 and released @entity11 , who charged over in the corner			2
a @entity139 penalty reduced the arrears , but it was fleeting respite			0
@entity5 ’s second try was a near - replica of the first , as they circumvented the visitors ’ narrow defence with alarming ease			1
again it came from a lineout on their right flank and when @entity50 received the ball from @entity155 he burst between @entity156 and @entity157 to go clear in midfield			0
his long pass fell in front of @entity11 but , despite the wet conditions , he picked it up on the bounce and carved inside to score			2
that act of individual brilliance was another stark indication of the continued gap between these nations – these are the moments of ball - playing @entity171 quality which their @entity119 rivals are simply unable to match at present			0
black - wash ! try heroes @entity11 and @entity48 embrace @entity133 after victory is won catch me if you can : @entity48 race to score a try during an awesome first - half for @entity5 touchdown ! @entity48 scored two tries in the first half as the @entity5 dominated the visitors you beauty ! @entity48 of the @entity5 celebrates with @entity133 and @entity155 after scoring a try astonishingly , @entity11 should have had a hat - trick within 14 minutes when he took a pass on the overlap to cross the line again , but the ball had travelled forward			1
it was a fortunate let - off for @entity0 as the chance should have been taken , but there were plenty more such openings to come			2
after a penalty by @entity50 , @entity52 was sin - binned – somewhat dubiously – for a high tackle on the home no 10 and the @entity5 made hay against their depleted opponents			2
@entity202 went close on the left , then @entity205 ’s midfield break created mayhem , @entity207 swerved around @entity208 on the right and sent @entity48 in from close range			1
the fourth @entity212 try came five minutes before the break as @entity49 fed the ball to @entity133 and he left @entity139 and @entity208 trailing in his wake before off - loading for @entity48 to score his second try			1
@entity50 ’s conversion made it 29 - 6 – and game , set and match – at half - time			0
when @entity0 re-emerged for the second half , there was a change in personnel , with @entity225 on for @entity226 , and a change in intensity levels too			2
the interval had evidently led to the dishing out of a few home truths and the tourists suddenly dredged up the will for the fight			0
sparks : there were flashes of brilliance from some players but @entity0 lost the series 3 - 0 consolation : @entity208 scores a try for @entity0 at the start of the second half powerhouse : @entity205 of @entity5 charges at @entity157 of @entity0 in his first @entity55 start whitewash : @entity205 helped @entity5 to a 3 - 0 test whitewash against @entity0 in the 43rd minute , the wounded defiance led to a try			1
@entity251 rampaged into space in midfield and from his off - load , @entity250 scorched away before passing on to @entity157			0
the @entity256 centre drove strongly towards the line , despite three defenders attempting to bring him down and from the ruck , @entity208 darted over to score for the second successive week			0
the wing so nearly struck again two minutes later , when he exploded through from the back of a lineout , but he was well held up over the line by @entity265			0
@entity0 ’s spirited rally stalled and they were forced to absorb a sustained period of @entity5 pressure , but they did so with far greater conviction than in the disastrous first half			1
when they re-emerged into enemy territory , @entity208 was once again the primary threat as his arcing run took him past @entity49 and into the home 22 , before @entity225 knocked on to squander a scoring position			2
the visitors continued to strive for a grandstand finish , but there was one more indignity to come			0
the clock had reached 80 minutes when one last @entity5 assault saw @entity265 audaciously off - load from the right to send @entity11 clear to gleefully notch his third try of the night			1
it was fitting that he was the one to have the last word			0
piledriver ! @entity287 of the @entity5 charges forward during the match in @entity289 all blacks : @entity207 catches the ball as @entity208 challenges him without success best foot forward : @entity139 of @entity0 kicks a penalty to get @entity0 on the scoresheet land of giants : @entity298 of @entity0 takes on @entity299 ( @entity300 ) and @entity202 during the second half eyes wide shut : @entity50 of the @entity5 charges forward past @entity0 's defence			1

@entity5 defeated @entity0 36 - 13 to complete @entity55 whitewash
@entity5 equalled their own record of 17 consecutive @entity55 wins
@entity11 scored a hat - trick of tries , with @entity48 getting a brace
@entity0 could *n't* cope with the @entity212 's first - half onslaught but *responded* better after the break with @entity208 scoring their only try
