for @entity1 , 20 , from the port of @entity3 in southern @entity4 , balloons are more than just a party favour - they 're a way of life			1
one of a growing number of ' looners ' worldwide , @entity1 and girlfriend @entity10 , 21 , are sexually attracted to the rubber inflatables and say that the toys play a key role in their private life			1
strange though it might sound , the couple insist that not only is their penchant for balloons harmless , it 's completely normal as well			1
happy : @entity1 , 20 , and girlfriend @entity10 , 21 , are ' looners ' and confess to being obsessed with blowing up balloons that , however , is not what @entity1 thought when he first realised he had an unusual interest in balloons as a teenager			1
' i was just continually inflating this balloon and feeling it against my body and then suddenly , it was just the most fantastic and extraordinary thing i have ever tried , ' he says of his eureka moment			0
but his euphoria soon gave way to fear			0
' the way i felt after i found out that i had this special interest in balloons was that i was a freak , ' he admits			2
' i felt that i was standing out			0
and i felt most of all that i was alone			0
' but , as he soon discovered following a foray onto the internet , he was n't			0
indeed , as @entity42 soon found out , he was n't even unusual			0
the ' looner ' community worldwide is thought to be approximately 250,000 strong , with men outnumbering women by 30 to one			1
passion : according to @entity1 , different colour balloons have different meanings for him community : there are an estimated 250,000 looners worldwide , with men outnumbering women by 30 to one despite sounding like an internet - fuelled phenomenon , looners have also been around for more than three decades , with the first looner club , @entity57 's @entity56 , launched in 1976			1
' a looner has a special interest for balloons , ' he explains			1
' we use balloons as a sexual aid and we see balloons differently than most other people do			2
' for her part , girlfriend @entity10 had long harboured a fetish for latex outfits and voluptuous gentlemen but all that changed when she met @entity1			1
now a committed looner herself , she says she enjoys being able to combine her penchant for chunky chaps with balloons			1
' i love that my man is big , ' she smiles			2
' it 's just who i am and i love big things			2
i see the balloons a little bit like a man , a big man who i am trying to make a little love with			2
' so what exactly does being a looner involve ? according to @entity1 , much of it revolves around blowing up balloons and cuddling them , although colours do , apparently , make a difference			1
not so good : @entity1 prefers balloons made from natural latex as the party variety are too easily popped ' what turns me on about a balloon is mainly the expansion part of it , ' he confesses			1
' i am very fascinated that such a small thing can grow into being huge without having to explode , although they do , of course , explode occasionally			0
' every colour wakes up a feeling inside of me , ' he adds			0
' the yellow colour makes me happy			0
and then there is these red and black colours as well which are like : " i 'm naughty			0
do whatever you 'd like to do with me "			0
' ' balloons are brought out during special times , which is one thing that would make it more likely to be a fetish object than something you would see every single day , ' comments sexologist and sociologist , dr @entity118			2
' part of the thing that makes a balloon fetish too is that many look as though they 're a sexual shape			0
many balloons are very breast like			2
others are buttock - like			0
' regardless of what shape they are , @entity1 , who prefers special balloons made from natural latex , says he wo n't be giving up his penchant for inflatables any time soon			1
' if i had to choose between @entity10 and my balloons , then i would of course choose her first , ' he muses			1
' but if there was n't any other way of doing it , i would probably just hide it and do it by myself			0
