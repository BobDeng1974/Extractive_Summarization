by @entity0 last updated at 8:03 am on 7th september 2011 it is a rather ordinary @entity2 coastal city that hardly looks like the most attractive holiday destination for wealthy tourists from thousands of miles away			1
but an @entity6 couple who have just visited @entity7 for the 39th year running insist it is like ' heaven on earth '			1
@entity10 and @entity11 , who live in bustling @entity12 , @entity13 , have spent three weeks in the @entity15 city every year since 1972			1
lovers ' paradise : @entity10 and @entity11 enjoying their beloved @entity7 in 1943 and today it holds a special place in their hearts because they met there in 1943 , when mr @entity24 , now 87 , visited his future wife 's hometown as an 18 - year - old in the @entity28			1
mrs @entity11 , 83 , said she dreams about ' beautiful ' @entity7 , whose landmarks include a lighthouse and an aquarium			1
now the couple return each year to @entity7 , whose fort and pleasant countryside is more commonly enjoyed as a pleasure outing for coach trips from the @entity37 and nearby @entity38			1
mrs @entity11 said : ' my heart is always here			1
' i dream about it all the time			1
you have the beautiful countryside in the background and the beautiful sea here			1
' it ’s like heaven on earth			2
' when i left the city was completely destroyed by @entity54 bombs , now it ’s just beautiful			1
' mrs @entity11 , who was born in the city 's @entity55 , became friends with mr @entity24 over the 14 months he spent there , after she met the young @entity59 playing baseball in one @entity7 ’s parks			1
they remained in contact after mr @entity24 was re-deployed on the @entity28 destroyer @entity65 in the @entity66 1947 , when mrs @entity11 was 18 , she received a telegram from her sweetheart that would change here life			1
' we wrote to each other all the time and then one day he said to me in a telegram , " swim on over here i want to marry you " , ' she said			2
' within no time at all , i sailed over to @entity77 on a steamer , which took 10 days			2
' @entity10 was sitting on the dock waiting for me			2
we married 10 days later on december 16 , 1947			2
' while the couple focused on family life and their three children for the next 25 years , in the summer of 1972 they made the trip they would repeat for nearly four decades			2
' we just love all of this , ' added mr @entity24 , 87 , gesturing at @entity88			1
' we always come back to the @entity89 and @entity90 because it brings back so many memories			2
' @entity93 ' : the lighthouse and lido are two tourist favourites in the @entity98 ' holiday destination of choice ' @entity11 learned to swim at @entity100			0
' to us this is the best place in the world			0
everyone ’s so friendly and helpful , you just ca n’t fault it			0
' at first , the couple stayed with mrs @entity11 ’s parents in the @entity108			0
but when her mother and father died , the @entity6 pair began staying at @entity113 hotel on the @entity89 - where they have spent every visit since			0
wish we were here : for this couple , @entity7 is the most beautiful place in the world @entity121 , owner of @entity113 , said she sees them as family			0
' they 're amazing , ' she said			0
' they have the same suite in the hotel every year and very much have the same sort of routine			0
' they go to the open air swimming pool at @entity100 every day and @entity11 swims several times a day - whatever the weather			0
they 're old friends to us - almost like family now			0
' we very much look forward to seeing them			0
