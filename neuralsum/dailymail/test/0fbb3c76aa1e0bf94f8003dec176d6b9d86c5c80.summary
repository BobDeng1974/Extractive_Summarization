these rusting ' ghost ' ships are the last remnants of what was once the @entity5 ' @entity4 , set to protect and serve in the hour of need			1
the @entity4 was set up in the wake of the @entity9 , and at its peak in the 1950s , the fleet consisted of nearly 2,280 ships moored across the @entity5			1
but as the need for the fleet has diminished , so has the number of vessels , and today , just over 120 ships remain , posing a risk to the environment in the bays where they are moored			2
at its height in 1950 , the @entity4 consisted of 2,277 ships at eight anchorage sites : @entity25 , @entity26 ; @entity43 , @entity44 ; @entity45 , @entity46 ; @entity47 , @entity48 ; @entity49 , @entity50 ; @entity51 , @entity52 ; @entity53 , @entity54 ; and @entity55 , @entity56			1
out of these eight , only @entity25 , @entity43 and @entity45 exist today			0
long years of neglect and disuse have turned these ships into near wrecks , with flaking paint polluting the waters with heavy metals and hazardous chemicals			0
the worst affected is the @entity65 , where less than 50 ships remain			0
at its peak , in 1952 , the bay had 340 ships anchored			0
today , less than 50 ships remain , slowly polluting the bay , which is a critical environmental area for fish and wildlife			0
the federal @entity73 has pledged to dismantle the fleet at @entity45 , with 25 ships in the worst condition taken out within two years and the remainder to be scrapped by the end of 2017			0
reduced : out of the original eight anchorage sites , only three ; @entity25 , @entity26 ; @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , @entity46 remain pollution : the worst affected mooring side is @entity45 in @entity46 where less than 50 ships remain , slowly releasing toxins into the bay going , gone : at its peak , in 1952 , the @entity45 , @entity46 site had 340 ships anchored - today , less than 50 ships remain the federal @entity73 has pledged to dismantle the fleet at @entity45 , with 25 ships in the worst condition taken out within two years and the remainder to be scrapped by the end of 2017 the @entity4 was established to serve as a reserve of mainly merchant vessels to be activated for national defense and national emergency purposes			1
the vessels can be activated within 20 days to four months , in order to provide shipping during national emergencies , either military or non-military , such as commercial shipping crises			1
throughout its first thirty years , the @entity4 vessels were activated to help transporting coal and grains in times of shortage , and ships were brought in during the @entity108 , the 1961 @entity110 crisis and the @entity111			1
@entity112 in 1975 , the @entity4 was augmented by the @entity4 ( @entity113 ) to provide for military emergencies			2
since then , ships have been activated to support @entity5 troops and transport cargo in the @entity118 in 1990 and aided in several humanitarian disasters in the new millennium			1
in 2005 , four @entity4 ships were used for relief operations in the aftermath of hurricanes @entity125 and @entity126 , and five years later , six were used in the wake of the devastating earthquake in @entity129			2
its most recent operation took place in the wake of @entity133 in 2012 , when two @entity4 training vessels were called in			0
as of april 30 , 2014 , only 122 vessels are left in the @entity4 , and their numbers are reducing still			2
zombie ship : one of the ships moored in @entity45 , @entity46 is covered in rust , slowly eating up the once - gray paint no life : long years of neglect and disuse have turned the ships into near wrecks , with flaking paint polluting the waters with heavy metals and hazardous chemicals the ships , jokily known as the ' @entity36 ' is so rarely used that many of the ships are falling apart , creating naval graveyards rather than emergency fleets			0

the @entity5 ' @entity4 was set up after the @entity9 in 1945
the fleet can be activated within one to four months to aid in national defense and emergencies
at its height in 1950 , the @entity4 consisted of 2,277 ships , reduced to 230 by 2007 , and 122 in april last year
