by @entity0 for the @entity1 a £ 20,000 heart implant that allows patients to have lifesaving mri scans – which can damage traditional devices – is now being offered on the @entity6			1
the technological advance means that thousands of people with abnormal heartbeats can now undergo these ‘ gold - standard ’ health checks without risk			2
previously , people with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( @entity15 ) , which send electrical pulses to the heart to change a fatal rhythm into a normal one , were denied mris because they use a magnetic field that can stop the metal leads used in the devices working properly			1
lifesaving : @entity23 , 41 , pictured with her daughter @entity24 , has been fitted with the new pacemaker , which is the size of a matchbox and sits just below the collarbone currently , more than 6,000 people a year in the @entity29 receive @entity15 , although this figure is set to increase after the @entity31 updated its guidelines meaning more people now qualify for one			1
of these , almost two - thirds will need an mri scan within ten years of receiving a device			2
the scans allow doctors to view detailed images of internal organs and blood vessels , and are essential in diagnosing additional heart problems , cancer and even diseases such as @entity45 ’s			1
until now , the powerful magnetic fields and radio waves used by @entity49 scanners risked causing the implants to deliver an unnecessary shock or heat up and burn the heart tissue			1
instead , people have been limited to less sophisticated screening such as x-rays and ultrasound scans , leading to delays in diagnosis			2
but the new @entity15 – the @entity59 – allows doctors to carry out mris on any part of the body including the heart			1
developed in the @entity67 over a decade , the battery - operated device has special software to protect the @entity15 from the scan ’s magnetic field and buffers any interference			1
using a wireless laptop , the doctor can reprogramme the 2in - long @entity15 before a scan , ‘ blinding ’ it from detecting abnormal heart rhythms during this time			1
the latest device costs twice as much as traditional implants			0
@entity23 is one of the first patients in the world to benefit from the new - style implant , which is the size of a matchbox and sits just under the muscle below the collarbone			1
the 41 - year - old has cardiomyopathy , a condition that causes the heart muscle to thicken and weaken over time , making it less able to maintain a normal rhythm			2
this puts her at risk of the heart stopping suddenly			2
the mother - of - two , who is a carer for the elderly and for disabled children , was diagnosed in 1996 after suffering blackouts , and she was put on drugs to decrease the activity of her heart			2
doctors considered her suitable for this new @entity15 as her condition is progressive , so she has a high chance of needing an mri scan			1
@entity23 , who lives on a canal boat in @entity106 , @entity107 , said : ‘ i feel i could live for ever now			1
it ’s given me complete peace of mind			0
before , i was scared of taking any exercise or even picking something up – i could n’t live my life to the full			0
‘ but this is like having my own personal paramedic which will respond faster than an ambulance and restart my heart			0
‘ it also means doctors can perform an mri , which is vital because they can check if my condition is getting worse and give me treatment at the earliest possible stage			0
‘ without it , i would have been able to have an x-ray , for example , but these do n’t give such a clear and detailed picture			0
’ her operation was carried out in april by dr @entity129 , a consultant cardiologist at @entity130 in @entity107			2
other hospitals now offering the device to patients include @entity134 in @entity135			0
during the 45 - minute procedure , carried out under local anaesthetic , a small incision is made in the left side of the chest to create a pocket in the muscle to hold the icd			0
two wires leading from it are threaded through the incision into a vein in the upper chest and through this into the top and bottom of the heart ’s chambers , where they are embedded into the muscle			0
the patient is sedated while the heart is stopped briefly to test the icd			0
finally , the incision is closed using dissolvable stitches			0
dr @entity129 said : ‘ this device means patients can undergo mri scans , which are the now the gold standard for diagnosing life - threatening or disabling conditions such as spinal problems			1
thousands were denied these scans before , which led to delays in diagnosis and treatment			0
the @entity6 will also potentially save money through people being diagnosed earlier			0

new £ 20,000 pacemaker allows patients to have lifesaving mri scans
@entity23 , 41 , from @entity107 has been fitted with the new @entity15
it can be ' blinded ' from detecting abnormal heart rhythms during @entity49
