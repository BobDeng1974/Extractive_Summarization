by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:11 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 20:42 est , 23 july 2012 holidaymakers visiting a beach where at least 1,000 bombs have been found called yesterday for the sands to be closed to the public until the missiles have been removed			2
unsuspecting families were sunbathing on what has been dubbed @entity10 as experts prepared to blow up more of the @entity13 ordnance which tumbled out of the cliffs three - quarters of a mile away during a landslide on saturday			1
fifteen controlled explosions were carried out on sunday by the @entity17 , less than 24 hours after the rockets , grenades , and 20lb bombs were spotted by a dog walker at @entity22 , @entity23			1
a bomb disposal team has been called in to an @entity23 coastal landslip that revealed hundreds of @entity13 munitions the weapons , including rockets , mortars and 25lb ( 11kg ) shells , could take days to clear the missiles had buried themselves in the earth cliffs after missing their target when the area was used as a practice bombing range from the war until the early 1970s			1
although many are practice rounds they still contain explosive detonators and coastguards fear they may be highly volatile after being buried in the cliffs for so many years			1
a cordon was lifted yesterday morning by @entity44 who planned to seal off the beach again when the tide went out and the clear - up operation could resume			2
families heading for the beach yesterday morning said they had no idea there was any danger			0
@entity54 , 65 , who was with her grandson @entity55 , 11 , said : ‘ i did not know anything about this			0
it ’s disgusting they have not sorted this out in nearly 70 years			0
this place is very popular			0
‘ there needs to be more warning signs and bigger warning signs especially this time of year when hundreds of children will be coming down			0
the whole beach should be closed really but i suppose they do not want to scare everybody			0
‘ it is not that far from the beach to where the bombs are and if they are blowing things up they really should tell people			2
’ the coastline was used as a practice bombing range during @entity13 and the 1970s mrs @entity54 said the only sign she had seen about the dangers of unexploded ordnance was an old rusty @entity81 one that people would not heed because it had been there for years			1
@entity86 , from the @entity87 , who planned to take children @entity89 , five , and @entity90 , three , to the sands , said she was also unaware anything was wrong			0
retired publican @entity93 , 72 , who lives near the beach , said : ‘ i have seen a few bombs at odd times but never anything like this			2
’ @entity97 has warned the public to avoid the area and said anyone finding anything should dial 999			0
a dog walker stumbled across the deadly find on saturday afternoon but the emergency measures were only put into place yesterday when the tides allowed full checks of the beach			1
the fins of many of the bombs have been left sticking out of the mud and rock which has fallen onto the beach			2
with holiday crowds flooding to the coast , coastguards are warning visitors thinking of grabbing a souvenir that the bombs may be ' highly volatile ' and capable of ' causing serious injury or worse '			2
coastguards say the odd item of explosives often turn up in dribs and drabs after being embedded in the cliffs for decades			1
but over the weekend , a landslip caused by the combination of heavy rain and coastal erosion exposed at least 1,000 weapons			2
coastguards say that most of them are probably dummy or practice rounds – but they still contain enough explosive to cause terrible injuries			1
a 24 - hour guard has been placed on the beach by @entity44 amid fears that children may be tempted to pick up a ' trophy ' during the school holidays			2
an army bomb disposal team from @entity146 ’s @entity145 has also been called in to clear the beach over the next few days			0
the @entity149 experts are hoping to remove some of the smaller items for some will have to be blown up on site in controlled explosions , @entity97 said			1
danger : coastguards say that most of the devices are probably dummy or practice rounds – but they still contain enough explosives to cause terrible injuries			1
the devices include rockets and mortar bombs they include rockets , mortar bombs and 25 - pounder bombs which were all fired into the cliffs by @entity167 aircraft during the war years and have been there ever since			1
@entity169 , watch manager at @entity97 , said : ' it ’s an old firing range from @entity13 and an area where we do get explosives and grenades			2
a bomb disposal officer holds one of the explosives revealed by the landslip at @entity22 beach ' when the cliff sinks it is a fairly regular occurrence that we get one or two			1
but there has been a fairly significant landslide occurred due to the erosion and bad weather which has caused it to slip			1
' it is a conservative estimate of more than 1,000 items , a mixture of explosives			2
it is going to take two to three days if not longer to transport the less harmful explosives out of the way while those which are more dangerous or live are detonated in controlled explosions			1
' there was no evacuation of the beach which was empty at the time of the landslip , he said , adding that the @entity97 were notified at 1.30pm on saturday			0
the beach can be approached along the sands from @entity202 or down a cliff top path but both points of access have been cordoned off			0
' the explosives have been fired into the cliff for target practice during bombing runs in @entity13 , ' mr @entity169 continued			1
' most are practice rounds but the @entity149 have advised us that the amount of explosives even in @entity214 rounds make them highly dangerous to handle			1
' because they have been in the cliff so long they may have become volatile and dangerous after being expose to the fresh air			0
' they have actually fallen in the landslip down onto the beach and are sticking out of the mud and rock and sand			0
the @entity23 beach of @entity22 , near @entity202 , was used as a practice bombing range during the @entity13 ' because there is such a great number of them what we do not want is people wandering around picking up the odd trophy to put on the mantel piece			1
' they are all highly dangerous and should not be touched at all			0
it is highly dangerous at the moment			0
i am no explosive expert but the @entity149 have told me these things could cause serious injury if not worse and even @entity214 rounds are dangerous			0
' even the dummy or practice rounds have some explosives in them			1
anyone who finds anything like this should dial 999			0
' police said they located several hundred old shells , some measuring approximately 15ins long with fins on them on the beach , which lies just below the village of @entity22			2
the shells were found along the shoreline on saturday at 4.45pm by a dog walker who called police			1
@entity44 said unfortunately due to high tide the area could only be partially checked by officers , and subsequently the shells were located by @entity265 officers on sunday			0
the @entity265 ( @entity265 ) from @entity266 were asked to attend at 12 noon , and carried out approximately 15 controlled explosions on the beach			1
other devices were removed by @entity81 staff at @entity271 , near @entity272 , and further devices remain in situ , which are not considered an immediate risk , to be dealt with today once the tide is low again			0
@entity277 : fifteen explosions were carried out at the @entity23 beach of @entity22 , near @entity202 , after a dog walker stumbled across the arsenal yesterday which has been embedded in the cliffs for more than 60 years weapon : a missile shaped bomb found after being embedded in the cliffs for decades insp @entity287 , of @entity44 , said ' although not live munitions , they do pose a danger as they have flash charges in them			1
' i would advise any member of the public finding such an item to ensure that they leave it alone and phone the police to notify us , so that we can arrange the necessary measures to make them safe			0
' on no account , should any person pick these items up and take them home			0
' the likelihood of more finds is high , as coastal erosion washing away some of the cliffs , and unearths more munitions			0

bad weather led to ground movement which exposed the huge arsenal at @entity22 , @entity23
a dog walker stumbled across the deadly find on saturday and 15 controlled explosions were carried out
@entity321 , mortar bombs and 25 - pounder bombs were recovered after they were fired into the cliffs by @entity167 aircraft during the war
most of the devices were dummy rounds used for bombing practice but contain enough explosives to cause terrible injuries
