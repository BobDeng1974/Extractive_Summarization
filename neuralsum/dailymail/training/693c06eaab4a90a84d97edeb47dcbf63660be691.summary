by @entity0 published : 20:08 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 20:08 est , 13 january 2014 @entity2 who almost died from @entity3 following on from an operation @entity2 was expecting to feel a bit sore after her operation to remove scar tissue left by @entity8 and other treatment			1
but the mother - of - two quickly became very ill and nearly lost her life after developing sepsis , a dangerous response to infection			1
while it typically occurs following pneumonia , and urinary or severe skin infections , many cases are linked to post-operative infections			1
@entity2 , 37 , had scarring on her stomach following radiotherapy for @entity23 ( cancer of a type of white blood cell ) as a teenager and two subsequent @entity8 births			1
she had the 12 - hour operation to remove the scar tissue , which was causing her pain , in september 2009			1
' it went well , i was kept in for two days as planned , and sent home on the third , ' says the former chef , from @entity36 , @entity37			1
' i had anticipated the pain afterwards , which was moderate , but i did n't feel quite myself			0
i felt fluey , ached all over , and had a high temperature , but put it down to the after - effects of the op. ' on my second day home , i felt lethargic and wanted to sleep constantly			1
but i 've had so much poor health - cancer , meningitis and pneumonia - that i did n't want to worry my loved ones			0
so i kept quiet and thought it was probably a normal reaction to major surgery			0
' but , by day three , @entity2 's breathing had become erratic , she was totally exhausted and could n't eat			1
' i knew then something was n't right			0
i tried to stand , but i collapsed , and i felt like i was suffocating , ' she says			1
deeply concerned , her family rang for an ambulance			0
but @entity2 's partner @entity55 ended up driving her to @entity56 in @entity57 himself - although not their nearest hospital , it was where she 'd had her operation			1
' by the time we arrived , i could n't stand and was struggling to stay awake , ' says @entity2			1
' something was drastically wrong			0
' it was only because @entity55 ' threw a tantrum ' at @entity67 that doctors agreed to see her quickly , she says			0
' he was very agitated , and more or less demanded that a doctor examine me - so i was seen within five minutes			0
' and it was this early intervention - rather than the four - hour waiting time she might have otherwise endured - that @entity2 believes saved her life			1
' i had a team of six or seven medics around me , and one of them had dealt with a sepsis case before , so he recognised my symptoms immediately , thank @entity80 , ' she says			1
' he spotted my shallow breathing , flu - like symptoms and fatigue - all tell - tale signs of sepsis - as well as the fact i had n't been to the loo for ten hours			1
' @entity88 occurs as the body fights to increase oxygen flow to the brain , and sepsis patients struggle to pass urine as the condition affects their kidney function			1
@entity2 was diagnosed with severe sepsis and taken to intensive care because her organs had begun shutting down			1
' i was barely conscious and i felt like i was dying			2
my mum contacted my dad and got my brother to return from @entity102 , where he was working - no one thought i was coming home			2
' sepsis occurs when the immune system over-reacts to a fungal , viral or bacterial infection , attacking the heart and other organs			2
it can cause fever , inflammation , low blood pressure , blood clotting problems and multiple organ failure			0
the most common causes are pneumonia , bowel perforation ( when a hole opens up in the bowel , letting its contents into the abdomen ) , urinary infection and severe skin infections			2
however , an estimated 10 per cent of all cases are the result of post-operative infections , with bowel surgery carrying the highest risk because of the large number of bacteria in the area			0
it usually takes 48 to 72 hours for sepsis to develop - genetic factors can affect the timing - but it can actually start developing several days after surgery			2
around 37,000 people die from sepsis every year - more than from bowel and breast cancer ( two of the most common causes of cancer deaths ) combined			2
she was diagnosed with severe sepsis and taken to intensive care because her organs had begun shutting down however , an estimated 13,000 of these deaths are preventable , according to a report last year from the @entity150 , which blamed delayed diagnosis and treatment , failure to recognise the severity of the illness and poor procedures , for the deaths			1
campaigners , including the charity @entity159 , are calling for greater awareness of symptoms and for medics to be better trained to diagnose the condition			0
the charity was founded by dr @entity164 , an intensive care doctor at the @entity166 in @entity167 , @entity168 , following the death of a 37 - year - old patient who developed sepsis in 2006 after a vasectomy			1
the patient 's condition was missed by two gps before he ended up being rushed to hospital			0
within 48 hours he was dead			0
' part of the reason for the low awareness is that sepsis was only recognised relatively recently , ' explains dr @entity164			2
' tissue decay and bacterial infection have always existed , but sepsis is very complex and was only officially defined in 1991 , following a consensus among international experts			1
' ( it was formerly known as septicaemia , but this term tends to be associated with a bacterial infection of the blood through cuts or injury , which misrepresents the wide range of causes of sepsis			2
) slurred speech , triggered by lack of blood supply to the brain mottled or discoloured skin extremely painful muscles , due to lack of oxygen passing no urine ( in one day ) as the kidneys stop working properly severe breathlessness - the body senses there is n't enough oxygen getting to the brain , so it increases the ' drive ' to breathe to increase it chronic tiredness and swelling of the affected area another problem is that sepsis can affect all specialisms in medicine			1
as dr @entity164 says : ' whereas heart attacks are “ owned ” by cardiologists , strokes by stroke specialists , and so on , there are no specific sepsis specialists fighting for money to combat it			2
' this makes funding harder to attract			0
furthermore , it is difficult to diagnose , as there is no single tool for spotting it			0
' all we have currently is a blood test that can help identify high levels of lactate , a chemical which can indicate organ failure and the approach of septic shock , ' says dr @entity164			0
he adds : ' this is the most severe end of sepsis , when organs begin to fail and blood pressure falls			1
we welcome the report from the ombudsman because it highlights the human cost of the low awareness			0
' the good news is that researchers at @entity248 in @entity57 recently discovered a group of biomarkers in the blood that signal the presence of sepsis , so a test may be available within as little as two years			2
as for @entity2 , doctors located the main site of the sepsis on the right - hand side of her body , where a large amount of septic pus had collected			1
it 's thought the infection had spread there , via the bloodstream , from the surgical incision			0
three drains were inserted to remove the pus , and @entity2 was given strong antibiotics and put on life support			1
' i was induced into a coma for nearly a day while the fluid was draining so i could rest , mentally and physically , from the trauma , as i could not breathe properly for myself			2
when i came round i felt better , ' she says			0
now , three years on , she still has nerve damage in her back from where the pus had been removed via a tennis ball - sized drain hole			0
this damage means she sometimes suffers severe pain , as well as frequent numbness from her shoulder to her knee			0
' i 'm not complaining though - i 'd have died otherwise , ' she says			0
' i 'm not blaming any doctors for the sepsis because post-operative infection is a risk with any surgery , but i strongly believe medics need to be better trained to spot it			0
' i 'm only here because the right doctor happened to walk past my bed at a critical moment , when my organs were starting to fail			0

@entity2 , 37 , from @entity36 , had an operation to remove scar tissue
on her second day home , she felt lethargic and wanted to sleep constantly
she was eventually diagnosed with severe sepsis and taken to intensive care
