@entity0 has his ex-lover calling him a monster and suing him for plenty of his hard - earned millions			1
he has a rapper who used to be his friend and business partner trying to humiliate him with false accusations that he is illiterate			0
he has the dangerous duo of @entity9 and @entity10 jostling at the head of the queue to be his opponents next year in what he insists will be the last two fill - your - bank - accounts fights of his career			1
then he has all those high - powered cars to keep polished , all the jewel - encrusted watches to wind , his kids to take out to @entity56 and his promotions company to expand into what he expects to become the biggest in the hardest game			2
meanwhile he has a million or more pay - per - view subscriptions to sell for this saturday ’s @entity62 rematch with @entity30 , the macho @entity63 who dragged him into his most rugged brawl of recent years			1
at 37 , there should be times when he feels like he ’s going on 65			2
yet he looks fresher than the daisies which spring up the @entity69 desert the morning after it rains here			0
and he lasts a lot longer			0
@entity10 is hoping to set up a fight with the @entity73 superstar next year @entity0 is the main focus for the camera bulbs as he promoted his fight in @entity62 those flowers wilt within hours under the sun but @entity0 keeps a spring in his step			1
not only that but he does not appear to have a care in the world			0
this is not only the highest - paid but probably the most single - minded of athletes			2
ms @entity37 alleges – among other un-pleasantries endured between being showered with gifts like a $ 2.5million 17 - carat diamond – that @entity0 held a gun to her head , imprisoned her in his bling - laden home and berated her with foul - mouthed insults in public			1
@entity0 shrugs off ms @entity37 ’s law - suit and mr @entity41 ’s ‘ tragic ’ slur on his education as ‘ just circus stuff to which i pay no attention			1
’ as it happens there is always the smell of greasepaint around his fights , which intentional or otherwise keeps selling the tickets at a rate which earns him around $ 40m a time			0
this enterprise also demands that he focusses his mind away from all the hassle of his garish life			0
‘ nothing ever distracts me from a fight , ’ he says			2
’ @entity0 in one of his favourite poses - with a pile of dollar bundles @entity0 leaves his private jet in @entity119 - the boxer owns one jet for him and one for his team not even the prospect of being jailed , which he was for a previous conviction for assault and battery of a previous lady partner			1
certainly not now that he can see the giant safe at the end of the prize - ring ’s tunnel of pain			2
one final year of submitting to his own constantly repeated mantra – ‘ hard work , dedication ’ - should bring in another $ 150m			1
at least double that if he agrees to meet @entity9 in one – or even both – those climactic fights next may and september			0
for the moment , the @entity139 is denying the assertion of the @entity9 camp that they are in ‘ serious negotiations ’ to finally make the super-fight which the world has been waiting an eternity to see			0
‘ i ca n’t say what comes after @entity147 , ’ he reiterates			0
‘ i never allow any distractions from my next opponent			0
’ since @entity30 roughed him up in the @entity33 for several rounds before becoming his 46th victim four months ago , that absolute concentration on the job at hand is probably advisable			1
not that many here expect him to have as much trouble second - time around			0
@entity0 has revealed that his rematch with @entity158 could be one of his final fights @entity161 ( pictured ) will take on @entity30 in @entity62 on saturday @entity10 , who may be at ringside as he keeps up his pursuit of a fight with @entity0 before the great man retires , expects @entity30 to be ‘ chasing shadows on saturday night			1
’ @entity168 ’s two - time world champion – who awaits confirmation of an opponent for an interim fight in the @entity73 on december 6 - holds firm to the belief that ‘ my speed is the one element which can give @entity0 more problems than he has had of late			1
’ the waiting game goes on for @entity10 and @entity9 , who defends his version of the world welterweight title against @entity180 in @entity181 next month			0
the show goes on for @entity0 , circus or not			2
@entity0 v @entity30 will be live late this saturday night on @entity184 .			1

@entity0 and @entity30 will meet in a rematch at the @entity33 in @entity62 on saturday
@entity0 *narrowly* beat @entity30 by a split *decision* in a close fight at the same venue back in may
the 37 - year - old revealed he plans to retire in 2015 and may only box twice more after his rematch with @entity30
boxing fans and critics praying for him to lose his cherished unbeaten record of 46 bouts
