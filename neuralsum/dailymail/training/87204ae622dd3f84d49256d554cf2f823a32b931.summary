the @entity0 sparked fury last night after saying they would not suspend an mp who had said he would be ready to fire rockets from @entity4 into @entity5			1
@entity6 , @entity0 mp for @entity7 , initially apologised after he was accused of inciting violence following a post on @entity10 last month in which he said : ' the big question is - if i lived in @entity4 would i fire a rocket ? - probably yes			1
' last night , after an investigation lasting three weeks , the @entity0 chief whip @entity14 said he did not believe mr @entity6 's comments were ' in any way anti-semitic ' or motivated by anti-semitic intentions			1
and he said he did not believe the tweet brought the party into disrepute			2
@entity6 , @entity0 mp for @entity7 , said on @entity10 : ' the big question is - if i lived in @entity4 would i fire a rocket ? - probably yes ' mr @entity14 said that mr @entity6 had accepted his tweet offended some people and has insisted he would make sure his comments in the future are ' difficult to misinterpret ' while also condemning violence from both @entity5 and @entity29			1
the chief whip said he took into account mr @entity6 's comments condemning violence on both sides before the tweet , his calls for a ceasefire , criticism of @entity38 , explanation that the tweet sought to envisage how a @entity29 may feel and his apology			1
@entity43 mp @entity42 said : ' most people will think @entity6 said he thought terrorism was acceptable when he said he 'd probably fire a rocket at @entity5			1
' if that does n't bring the @entity0 into disrepute you have to ask what would			1
' mr @entity14 recognised his decision ' will not satisfy some people '			2
in a statement , mr @entity14 said : ' @entity6 has subsequently repeated his apology and placed it and his explanation on his website			1
' in light of that apology , the assurance by @entity6 that he would do all he could to ensure comments he made would be in a form that would be difficult to misinterpret , and that he will continue - in relation to the @entity5 / @entity29 situation - to condemn violence on both sides and support moves for a cease fire , i do not intend to take further action in relation to the tweet			1
light streaks and trails are seen as rockets are launched from @entity4 towards @entity5 before a 72 - hour cease fire was due to expire ' i am conscious that this decision will not satisfy some people			0
to them i would say , at a time of considerable international unease in the @entity82 , comments have been made by politicians from all parties that have been unwelcome by some or other section of society			0
' the question i have had to answer is not , did the comments by @entity6 cause offence to some people ( within the party or outside ) , but did they bring the party into disrepute ? ' @entity6 accepts that his tweet did cause offence to some people			1
he recognises that the use of @entity10 as a form of communication can lead to misinterpretation and accepts the need for greater care in the future			2
' however , i do not believe it was in any way anti-semitic or motivated by anti-semitic intentions and i do not believe his tweet brought the party into disrepute			2
i believe that his statement including an apology on july 23 should draw a line under this matter			0
' following last month 's tweet , the @entity116 called on @entity0 leader @entity118 to withdraw the party whip from mr @entity6			1
the mp subsequently said his comments were not intended to support @entity38 rocket attacks , adding : ' if they gave the opposite impression , i apologise			2
' mr @entity6 's membership of the party has previously been suspended for a period following previous controversial remarks about @entity5 and the @entity128			2
@entity29 negotiators were last night considering a proposal to end the month - long @entity5 - @entity38 war as the latest 72 - hour cease - fire in the @entity4 was due to expire			0
since the truce went into effect sunday , @entity5 has halted military operations in the coastal territory and @entity4 militants have stopped firing rockets			0
the ceasefire gave both sides time to negotiate a more sustainable truce and a roadmap for the coastal territory			0
a member of the @entity29 delegation to talks in @entity147 said his team was considering an @entity150 proposal for easing parts of the @entity5 blockade of @entity4 , bringing some relief to the territory			0
but other key areas were still left unresolved , including @entity38 ' demand for a full lifting of the blockade and @entity5 calls for @entity38 to disarm			0
these would have to be left to later talks			0
yesterday @entity162 , the top @entity38 leader in @entity4 , said that ' achieving a permanent truce can come only through lifting the blockade on @entity4			0
' amid the cease - fire , an @entity167 video journalist and a freelance @entity29 translator working with him were killed when ordnance left over from the war exploded as they covered a story about the conflict 's aftermath			0
@entity176 national @entity177 , 35 , and @entity178 , 36 , died when an unexploded missile believed to have been dropped in an @entity5 airstrike blew up as @entity4 police engineers worked to neutralise it in the northern @entity4 town of @entity184 .			0

@entity6 , @entity0 mp for @entity7 , initially apologised
