@entity0 were terrific against @entity1 but if i was at their team meeting at @entity5 on monday morning the first thing i would do is stick the @entity7 league table on the whiteboard			1
it will show @entity0 third behind @entity11 and @entity12			2
@entity0 have turned an important corner but they have achieved nothing yet			1
they are always the team everyone wants to beat and that will go up another level after the win in @entity20			0
@entity0 have won only one @entity7 since 2003 so now is the time to step up another level			1
it ’s time to be hyper - critical and reset their goals			1
in any sport what seems like the best win of your life at the time is often only a stepping stone to something much better and more significant			0
@entity0 's stars celebrate their win against @entity1 in the changing rooms after friday night 's brilliant result the players celebrations were matched by head coach @entity40 's ( centre ) and his backroom team i would also remind those who did so well against @entity1 that @entity0 now have a growing number of very talented players who have either been dropped or injured and will be busting a gut to get back into the team : the likes of @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 to name but a few			1
and that ’s before you consider long - term injury victims @entity60 , @entity63 and @entity64			0
these guys will not be celebrating friday ’s win and will be redoubling their efforts to get back into the team			0
against @entity69 you go with the squad that did so well against @entity1 although i would bring @entity71 back if fit			1
that ’s no slight on @entity73 , who did well , but @entity71 is a big player for @entity0 and needs to be involved whenever possible			2
@entity0 centre @entity74 scored the decisive try of the game as they won 16 - 21 against @entity1 @entity74 ( centre ) is mobbed by his @entity0 team - mates as they celebrate his second half try against @entity1 the great thing about friday night in @entity20 was the hard - edged mental attitude and ruthless approach @entity0 displayed starting from the stand - off in the tunnel and ending with @entity86 banging over a long kick to close out the game			1
brilliant , it was a quantum leap for the future and with that approach @entity0 can achieve great things			2
everybody expects them to beat @entity69 on saturday and this could easily be a week in which the intensity in training and playing drops off 10 per cent			2
wrong ! this must be the week when everybody ups their intensity 10 per cent			0
i ’d even take it further than that			0
i would challenge @entity0 to hit some easily measurable world - class standards against @entity69			1
set - pieces must be @entity106 one hundred per cent scrum - possession from your put - in is a must			1
@entity0 achieved this against @entity1 and must replicate that against a strong @entity69 pack			1
in the lineout , 95 per cent possession on your own throw is the standard required			0
in @entity20 @entity0 were 81.8 per cent , which is good but not good enough			2
@entity69 have a strong lineout so this will be a genuine challenge			2
@entity0 's lineout possession percentage must improve , while there were too many soft penalties given away @entity123 did well in most departments , but @entity0 's kicking strategy needs to change too many soft penalties @entity0 conceded nine in @entity20 which is on the limit of what is acceptable			1
three in the first half were needless and normally @entity131 would have landed all three , not just two			0
against @entity69 the world - class standard would be six and i would bring a professional referee into every session to make sure every player understands the law			1
@entity138 three chargedowns is at least two too many			0
@entity0 have no real kicking option at 12 — though @entity123 did very well in other departments — so @entity142 and @entity143 , who are great kickers , should be made part of the kicking strategy to give @entity147 and @entity148 more options			1
do n't forget drop goals whatever happened to the drop goal ? in 35 tests under @entity40 @entity0 have kicked just three , an amazing figure			1
i can guarantee you somewhere along the line this year @entity0 will have to kick a couple of drop goals at crucial times			1
so let ’s start working on that now			0
i would want to see three drop goals against @entity69 , doubling the total of the last three years			1
and let ’s try to kick one in the first five minutes of each half			0
fly - half @entity167 ( second left ) restored @entity1 ' eight point advantage with a drop goal of their own @entity171 ( blue scrum cap ) bounced back off the post protector at the @entity174 on friday do n't get distracted i would ban all talk of any other nation and indeed the @entity7 generally , let alone the @entity177			1
the focus should be totally on producing a world - class performance against @entity69			2
for this week nothing else in the rugby world matters			0
for those who stray consequences should be clearly spelt out to them			0
this team must continue to toughen up			0
it 's an 80 minute game i worked out many years ago that 90 per cent of all tests between the top six nations in the world have a points difference of less than seven going into the last 20 minutes			2
so you want your top players on the park during the last quarter			0
how often do you ever see @entity195 substituted for any reason other than injury ? i want @entity0 to start the game on saturday with the mindset that everybody , barring injuries , will play the entire 80 minutes			2
they have the fitness and conditioning to do that			0
if @entity0 are leading by a big margin after 70 minutes i would accept you empty the entire bench to guard against injury			0
but not before then .			0

@entity0 have turned a corner but they have n't achieved anything yet
they are third in the @entity7 table and must now reset their goals
@entity0 's set pieces must be *slicker* , and they ca n't afford to give away *sloppy* penalties as they did against @entity1
@entity40 's side have only kicked three drop goals in 35 @entity220 - they should try and kick that many in one game against @entity69
