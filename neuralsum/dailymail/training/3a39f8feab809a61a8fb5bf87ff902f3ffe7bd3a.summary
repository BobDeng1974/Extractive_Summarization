by @entity0 health bosses spent thousands of pounds sending a helicopter and four ambulances to a car crash 70 yards from a hospital – because its @entity7 ward had been closed leaving the injured having to be ferried miles to other units			1
they spent £ 2,500 despatching the @entity9 to the accident near @entity11 in @entity12 , which lost its emergency department a year ago			1
two rapid - response vehicles and two ambulances were also sent to the crash , in an operation that cost up to £ 3,500			1
they were scrambled after a driver in his 80s had a suspected heart attack at the wheel of his @entity23 and lost control of the car			2
it ploughed into a pedestrian , causing him serious leg injuries , then careered into two empty parked cars			0
the @entity23 driver was also hurt			0
@entity11 staff rushed out to help , but as the complex now only has a minor injuries unit which is not equipped to deal with badly injured patients , they were unable to take them in			1
the town lost its emergency department last october as part of changes to centralise @entity7 services across the area			1
the nearest emergency departments are now 13 miles away , at @entity45 in @entity46 , and 15 miles away at @entity47 in @entity48			0
in may , @entity49 , which has been spearheading a campaign to save the country ’s threatened @entity51 , revealed how the @entity11 closure had led to serious knock - on effects at these two hospitals			1
aftermath : @entity58 cordon off the scene after the crash close to @entity11 in @entity12 @entity62 documents showed 16,000 extra emergency patients would be pushed there every year			1
managers claimed the two @entity51 had been bolstered to cope with the extra strain			0
but studies showed the closure led to soaring numbers of patients waiting more than four hours in the two @entity51 last winter			0
at @entity45 , which is in neighbouring @entity71 , 20 per cent of patients ended up waiting more than four hours in the winter – three times higher than the national average			0
hundreds of scheduled operations were also cancelled due to an increase in emergency admissions			0
our report on @entity11 led to questions about the closure being raised in @entity82 by @entity83 , a @entity85 peer			1
he asked what assessment the @entity87 had made of the impact of the closure and was told by the health minister @entity91 that there was ‘ no government policy about the closure of @entity7 departments ’			1
loss : the @entity7 unit at the @entity12 hospital closed down a year ago the crash happened just before 1pm on tuesday			1
the first paramedic , who arrived five minutes after the 999 call , ordered the air ambulance thinking an airlift might be urgently needed			1
in the end the two elderly victims were sent by road ambulance			2
the injured pedestrian , who is in his 70s , went to @entity108			0
last night , a spokesman said he was in a stable condition			0
the car driver went to @entity45 where he was checked over and discharged the same day			0
@entity112 , 42 , from @entity113 in @entity12 , who uses @entity11 , said : ‘ it ’s absolutely ridiculous that they had to send an air ambulance to @entity11 because it lost its @entity7			1
' if they had kept it , they would have saved all that money			0
’ she went on : ‘ the ambulances now seem to operate as a taxi service between the hospitals			2
’ @entity124 , 77 , who witnessed the aftermath of the crash , said the organisation by the emergency services ‘ was brilliant ’			2
campaign : one of our reports highlighting the affect of closures but he added : ‘ the fact they had to send these ambulances to take them to different hospitals – that ’s a different matter			0
’ mr @entity124 , a retired businessman who is being treated at @entity11 hospital and was trying to get in for a blood test at the time , feared the closure of the emergency department would put him at risk in the future			1
he said : ‘ the real crisis for me is if i have to be whisked away in an ambulance , all the way to @entity48 , which is a ridiculous journey			0
’ ironically , the cost of the helicopter mission will not be picked up by the @entity62 , but by the charity which supports it			0
the @entity155 operates out of @entity156 in @entity157 and costs @entity159 and @entity9 £ 1.5 million a year to run			1
the aircraft covers @entity12 , @entity157 and @entity71 so is affectionately known as the ‘ @entity162 ’ service			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we rely entirely on charitable donations from the public and receive no central government or national lottery funding			0
’ @entity169 , which runs @entity11 and @entity108 , claimed the emergency department had been closed to create a better ‘ hub and spoke model ’ in the region			2
a @entity169 spokesman said : ‘ in @entity12 , @entity47 has been designated as a trauma unit , with the @entity176 in @entity177 designated as the region ’s major trauma centre			2
@entity11 has a minor injuries and illness unit			2
‘ the creation of this hub and spoke model is due to national clinical evidence showing that this improves patient safety and outcomes			0

@entity11 in @entity12 lost its @entity7 a year ago
£ 2,500 sent dispatching the air ambulance to a crash outside the hospital
four ambulances were also sent in an operation that cost up to £ 3,500
