after a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts , @entity0 was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the @entity8 final game of the season on sunday			1
that was not to be however , as after partying until well past midnight last friday , @entity0 , who is suffering from an injured hamstring , skipped out on a saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept , and in turn was fined by the @entity8			1
@entity0 was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior , saying ; ' it ’s about being accountable			0
instead of looking like a jackass			0
' and while his season may have been over , many believed @entity0 would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of this controversy , which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at @entity25 at the @entity26 in @entity27 on monday night alongside the likes of @entity29 and @entity30 , and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle on wednesday afternoon with girlfriend @entity33 and some buddies poolside at the @entity26			1
appearing on @entity61 ’s @entity60 earlier this week , @entity51 , a noted supporter of @entity0 , did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking			1
' my concern , i repeatedly said , was if @entity0 continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol , and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails , then i ’m going to be out , ' said @entity51			1
' in talking to people in and around the @entity8 , i believe @entity0 continues to have a problem with alcohol			2
and i believe ... that it is time for @entity0 to get some help			0
he continues to lie to his executives , to his coaches , to his teammates , to the media , and most of all , he continues to lie to himself			0
' he then said he would label @entity0 an ' alcoholic			0
' @entity0 decided to go tropical at one point , enjoying a nice frozen drink in his chaise the quarterback was getting in some rest after a lackluster rookie year the quarterback saw little playing time and only had two starts all year , which both resulted in losses in his second start he injured his hamstring and was forced to sit out the rest of the season @entity0 was known for his partying while at @entity100 , but said he was a changed man during the 2014 @entity101 , noting that he had ' grown up , ' before being selected 22nd overall by @entity8			1
just days into his training with the @entity8 however , the local press began calling him out on his partying , which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field			2
a source told @entity109 at the time ; ' @entity112 officials had bought into @entity0 's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat - boy lifestyle back in @entity116 , @entity117 , and they 've been stunned by his non-stop antics			1
' @entity0 was considered one of the best quarterbacks in the country , alongside @entity121 , when he played at @entity100 @entity0 won the @entity57 when he was just a redshirt freshman ( left ) and went pro after his junior year , with things getting off to a bad start after a photo of him rolling a bill went public ( right ) @entity0 's partying and antics were well known while he was in college @entity0 assured the @entity8 during the @entity49 draft that he had ' grown up ' and cooled it with the partying also causing some alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of @entity0 and later posted to @entity136 that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter , leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine			1
@entity8 head coach @entity143 spoke to @entity0 soon after the problematic photo was posted , a photo that could have led to an inquiry or a drug test from the @entity49 , and said he felt that things were back on track and that @entity0 was focused on football once again			2
there was also an odd incident during the regular season when he got into a fight with a fan in the lobby of his apartment building , and while alcohol seems to have played a role in the incident , it was the fan who was inebriated , not @entity0			0
@entity0 makes no effort to hide his love for a good time with friends a report in 2013 said that @entity0 did once seek help for drinking , but he denied it was true @entity0 said he has never sought counseling for alcohol abuse or anger management it should be noted that a very thorough and detailed story published by @entity61 in 2013 said that after his arrest for disorderly conduct back in 2012 and while still at college , @entity0 did seek help for an alcohol problem , seeing an counselor for six or seven weeks			2
@entity0 would later claim this report was false , and that he had never seen a counselor for anger management or for alcohol abuse while in college			0
as for his future with the @entity8 , that is a little unclear			0
@entity0 partied with @entity30 and @entity29 on monday night in @entity27 for @entity186 , @entity0 and his clan partied at the @entity26 and watched @entity188 perform in light of recent incidents , some are saying that the @entity8 should drop @entity0 for his ' lack of professionalism ' beauty queen @entity33 and @entity0 have been together for a little under a year training for next season wo n't begin until the summer , but already some , including @entity61 's @entity195 , have called on the @entity8 to fire @entity0 after last weekend 's incident , saying he and fellow player @entity197 have a ' complete lack of professionalism			1
' @entity197 was also out with @entity0 and showed up late for the team walk - through , an offense that carried a far stiffer punishment for the starter as he was forced to sit out the final game of the season			2
@entity33 is still in college at @entity207 @entity0 apologized for the incident this past weekend with the @entity8 , but not responded to any of his critics currently , @entity0 has a four year contract with the @entity8 worth about $ 8.25 million the 22 - year - old also has some of the most coveted , and lucrative , endorsement deals in the sports world with , among others , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , and @entity218 @entity0 has not responded to any of his critics in the wake of this scandal , though he did write on @entity221 monday as the off - season officially began ; ' there 's beauty in the struggle , ugliness in the success			1
' currently , @entity0 has a four year contract with the @entity8 worth about $ 8.25 million			2
the 22 - year - old also has some of the most coveted , and lucrative , endorsement deals in the sports world with , among others , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , and @entity218			0
for the time being , @entity0 just seems to be enjoying his week at the @entity26 , ringing in the @entity42 with a performance by @entity188 at the club			0
an @entity136 video was posted of @entity0 rapping to @entity188 's lyrics during his set .			0

@entity0 was spotted chugging champagne straight from the bottle while poolside at his hotel in @entity27 on wednesday
this just days after the quarterback came under fire when he missed a treatment session because he overslept after a night of partying
@entity0 was fined by the @entity8 for missing the *appointment* , and columnist @entity51 said that the footballer needed help
@entity0 's partying has been a topic of *conversation* since his rookie season began in july , with some worried his drinking was his *priority*
the @entity57 winner is now enjoying the off - season after a lackluster rookie year where he saw little playing time and just two starts
