by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 3:25 pm on 16th november 2011 former head of the @entity3 gives evidence to mps investigating the row over @entity8 border checks ministers were unaware that immigration controls had been relaxed to ease airport queues , the former head of the @entity3 admitted today			1
the news comes on the day the @entity14 exclusively revealed that a bombshell inquiry has found that @entity16 relaxed checks in clear defiance of ministers because he wanted ‘ quick wins ’ to speed passengers through airports			1
speaking to the @entity24 programme this morning , mr @entity16 said he was ' surprised ' that ministers had not been told of a decision to relax fingerprint checks on foreign nationals coming through @entity29 at busy times			1
however , he also admitted there was ' no evidence ' that home secretary @entity33 , or any other minister , had been informed of the plan			2
the former borders chief , who has resigned over the furore , told @entity38 that the decision to relax checks had been made by @entity29 officials , but added : ' it seemed to me a very sensible decision			0
' he said he assumed someone had informed the government of the plan , but when asked whether there was any evidence of this he said : ' there is no such evidence			0
' and while mrs may later forbade mr @entity16 from relaxing fingerprint checks on foreigners who need visas to enter the @entity8 , he claimed today that he approved the @entity29 plan because ' she had n't made her view clear on secure @entity59 '			1
a leaked draft copy of a disciplinary investigation into the conduct of mr @entity16 – who yesterday denied being a ‘ rogue ’ civil servant – reveals fingerprint checks on foreign nationals who need a visa to enter the @entity8 were relaxed on 164 occasions			1
this was despite the home secretary explicitly saying that , even ' in extremis ’ , this must not happen in case it allowed those from terrorist hotspots such as the @entity76 to enter unchecked			0
staff also casually referred to a pilot scheme authorised by @entity33 – which did controversially relax checks on @entity81 biometric passports and children travelling with their parents or on school trips – as ‘ children and chips ’			0
but the investigation , by former police officer @entity87 , concludes mr @entity16 – who yesterday denied any wrongdoing in a dramatic appearance before mps – had a ‘ case to answer ’ that he had broken the @entity93			2
had he not resigned , this could have led to his dismissal			0
the report by mr @entity87 , the @entity97 ’s head of enforcement and crime , which is likely to be published next week , supports mrs may ’s claim that mr @entity16 had relaxed border checks without her approval			1
mr @entity16 has said this claim was ‘ wrong ’ – putting mrs may ’s career on the line by implying she had misled @entity106			2
the internal inquiry , one of three into the scandal , paints a picture of how the civil service threw open the @entity8 ’s borders			0
but it is the confirmation that mr @entity16 did not have approval to go further , by relaxing visa checks on @entity118 nationals , that will be most significant at @entity119 and be seen as vindication of @entity122 ’s decision to back mrs may			1
the report – titled ‘ formal misconduct procedures ’ – makes clear that mr @entity16 had been agitating since january this year for the government to relax border controls and was looking for ‘ quick wins ’ to prevent chaos at airports			1
he initially suggested three measures : not routinely opening the biometric chips on passports belonging to @entity81 nationals ; not routinely checking the fingerprints of foreign nationals requiring a visa and not routinely checking the documents of @entity81 children travelling with their parents or on a school trip			0
giving evidence : @entity16 ( facing the panel ) speaking during a @entity144 meeting in the @entity145 , @entity146 suspended : home secretary @entity33 suspended @entity16 , claiming he went further than what she had agreed to , local media reported immigration minister @entity150 ’s office initially said he may be content to support the proposals but wanted more details of their impact			1
in april , mr @entity16 was sent a response from mrs may ’s office saying neither she nor mr @entity150 was ‘ content to agree ’ to the changes			2
the report then highlights an e-mail from mr @entity16 to a senior official in the @entity97 which lays bare his concerns that mrs may will not do what he wants			1
home secretary @entity33 may leaving 10 @entity163 yesterday it says : ‘ i am now very concerned about the impact of the summer pressures at the border			2
i am of the view that procedural changes will not be in place in time for the main pressure period			0
‘ i have little confidence that the home secretary will sign - off the changes ( in time / at all ) and we seem to have lost some of the urgency around getting this dealt with			0
’ a string of further emails are exchanged between mr @entity16 ’s office and mrs may ’s			2
one , dated july 19 , tells mr @entity16 : ‘ i can confirm you do not have authorisation to go to scenario 3 ( suspending fingerprint checks ) in any circumstances			1
’ mr @entity16 later asks again if he could move to ‘ @entity185 ’ in ‘ absolute extremis ’			2
he was informed on july 26 the answer was that he could not – ‘ in any circumstances ’			0
the report goes on to detail how senior staff had informed mr @entity16 that they had taken ‘ additional measures ’ which went beyond those authorised by ministers			1
on two occasions , details of these ‘ additional measures ’ were included in weekly reports for ministers – but they ‘ remained with @entity16 ’s @entity199 ’ and were not sent to mrs may or mr @entity150			0
the scandal was finally uncovered after a visit by @entity202 , chief inspector of immigration , to @entity29			0
he alerted mr @entity16 ’s superiors , who quizzed him about what had been happening			2
at this point , the report says mr @entity16 conceded that checks on fingerprints for those needing a visa had been suspended on 164 occasions over the past year – 156 times at @entity29			1
one very senior official said he could not ‘ possibly understand ’ how mr @entity16 believed he had the authority for his actions			0
the report , which is likely to be published next week , concludes that : ‘ i am clear that the evidence available would have led to a recommendation , should @entity217 still be a civil servant , that he has a case to answer in that he has not met the standards articulated in the various parts of the [ @entity222 ’			0
it adds : ‘ the home secretary authorised a time limited pilot to enable @entity3 to move to @entity228 checks [ not checking the chips on @entity81 passports or @entity81 children travelling with their families or on school trips against the @entity235 ] when queues became unmanageable , and then only for the period needed			1
no other reductions in border controls were authorised , even in “ absolute extremis ”			0

@entity16 confesses there is ' no evidence ' ministers knew about plans to stop fingerprinting foreigners at @entity29
@entity249 chief relaxed vital immigration checks in clear defiance of ministers because he wanted ' quick wins ' to reduce queues at airports
a report proves that mr @entity16 had relaxed border checks without the home secretary *'s* approval
