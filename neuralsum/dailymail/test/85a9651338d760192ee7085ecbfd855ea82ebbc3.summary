@entity0 remains a very painful place for @entity3 managers			1
consider this the first harsh lesson of @entity6 ’s tenure			2
back in the chill of mid-december , @entity7 led the @entity10 side here on the day it emerged he had handed in his notice of resignation			2
a convincing 2 - 0 defeat did nothing to alleviate the mood of gloomy chaos that had engulfed the club			1
nine days later , @entity7 was out on gardening leave			0
fast forward almost five months , and @entity3 arrived here in far more ebullient spirits with a new boardroom regime installed and three successive victories under @entity6 ’s command			0
that @entity26 and @entity27 were among the victims added to the sense of a substantial revival			0
in @entity32 , however , it felt more like a flashback to the bad old days of their campaign			0
@entity3 were simply second - best all over the plastic pitch in @entity32 striker @entity37 points to the skies after putting @entity39 in the lead at @entity41 @entity42 celebrates after an own goal doubles @entity39 's lead at the start of the second half @entity47 ( left ) celebrates after forcing an own goal for @entity39 's third to dent @entity3 ' second place hopes @entity39 : @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity42 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity37 ( @entity60 ) , @entity47 ( @entity61 ) subs : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity65 booked : @entity55 scorers : @entity69 ' , @entity67 ( og ) 46 ' , @entity70 ' @entity3 : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity67 , @entity75 ( @entity76 ) , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 ( @entity81 ) , @entity51 ( @entity82 ) subs : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 booked : @entity75 , @entity88 ref : @entity89 att : 5,093 immense credit must go to @entity39 , who recorded a thoroughly merited victory that has significantly boosted their play - off hopes			1
under @entity96 , they are capable of bright , energetic football that delivered goals from @entity37 and @entity47 , as well an own goal from @entity67			1
@entity6 , though , must have felt a twinge of despair			0
he has spent much of his recent time emphasising that nothing had been achieved by the recent uplift			0
that so much work still had to be done were they to achieve their aim of promotion			0
a first defeat of his six - game reign confirmed that assessment in the most emphatic fashion			1
the @entity10 outfit remain third behind @entity26 on goal difference , albeit with a game still in hand			2
radical improvement is once again required when they host @entity120 on sunday			0
@entity39 will face @entity121 at that same time , having just overhauled their key rivals for the fourth and final play - off spot			1
this was the best possible fillip for @entity96 ’s men , as they seek to grow that one - point advantage			2
@entity130 's @entity129 loanee @entity128 ( left ) attempts to block a shot by @entity39 ' @entity55 new manager @entity6 ( right ) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the @entity10 club @entity3 were without suspended skipper @entity135 – banned after a red card for an elbow on @entity27 ’ @entity138 at the weekend – which meant a starting role for @entity74 alongside @entity73 at the heart of the defence			1
there was little to trouble either backline in the initial exchanges , as the game developed at a rather sedate pace			0
@entity6 watched it unfold pensively			0
clearly , what he was seeing was n’t to his liking			0
his side did have flickers of threat early on , but they often owed much to fortune			0
@entity78 saw a mis - hit cross clawed out by @entity51 , before a similar delivery from @entity75 looped fractionally over			2
the winger was another change to @entity6 ’s line - up and he saw plenty of the ball before the break , without making it amount to a great deal			1
@entity39 's @entity42 ( left ) @entity3 fends off @entity75 of @entity3 as he runs with the ball @entity37 ( 2nd left ) opened the scoring following a first - half corner in the 3 - 0 defeat of @entity3 @entity37 ( centre ) wheels away after putting the hosts in front with a strike on 33minutes one neat bit of skill saw him drift infield from the left flank before thumping a shot just too high			1
another powerful swipe was blocked by @entity54 ’s head – at the expense of ringing ears			0
queens had offered even less up front throughout this spell , but suddenly sprang into life to claim the lead after 33 minutes with pretty much their first serious attack			2
@entity57 swept play wide to @entity42 who took on @entity67			1
the @entity10 left - back toppled , apparently looking for a foul that was n’t there , allowing @entity42 to break into the penalty area			1
his cut - back found @entity37 , who took a touch on his left foot before dispatching a sweet finish off his right			1
the home fans roared approval , barely having time to draw breath before the advantage was very nearly doubled			2
@entity37 set up @entity47 and his daisy - cutter drew a fine stop from @entity71 at full stretch			1
the @entity39 striker acknowledges the home supporters after making the score 1 - 0 in the first half play continues as a flare is let off in the @entity3 section of the crowd at @entity41 @entity39 goalkeeper @entity51 ensures @entity3 ' @entity74 does not find the back of the net @entity3 used the shock to stir them into greater vigour			1
@entity219 was close with a brave effort from a @entity72 cross , which led to him being flattened by his namesake in the @entity39 goal			1
then , after a @entity79 corner caused uncertainty , @entity80 sent a looping header against the bar			2
the first half duly closed with a penalty shout from @entity67 after he tangled with @entity52			1
far worse followed for @entity67 16 seconds after the restart as he got the final touch to his side ’s second concession of the evening			1
@entity42 celebrates after forcing an own goal from @entity3 @entity67 immediately after the break @entity39 's @entity47 ( left ) demonstrates a calm finish to put his side 3 - 0 to the good @entity10 minds still appeared to be in the dressing room as @entity47 surged into the box and sent a low cross speeding through the six yard box			1
it reached @entity42 beyond the far post , who angled a drive back towards goal			2
off balance , @entity67 attempted to clear from the line but only succeeded in helping the ball into the net via his heel			1
they looked shaken by the energy of their hosts			2
@entity96 ’s side seemed to be first to the ball in every area			0
@entity75 collected a booking for diving after attempting to go past @entity52 , but creating clear chances remained a trickier task			0
not long after , the winger was replaced by @entity76			0
@entity51 saw a deflected effort held , before a @entity264 effort from distance was shuttled round the post			0
yet there still was n’t a convincing edge to these attacking forays			0
the fluidity witnessed against @entity27 at the weekend had disappeared			0
@entity53 applauds the home support as he leaves the field followed by dejected @entity3 players queens were now content to try and pick @entity3 off when they could			0
and they notched their clinching third goal after 69 minutes			2
@entity59 nicked possession away from @entity76 and worked a little exchange that released @entity47			1
the flag stayed down as he calmly slotted beyond @entity71			0
@entity3 attempted a pride - saving late flurry but found @entity51 in excellent form in the home goal			1
notable saves from @entity79 and substitute @entity82 ensured @entity6 ’s side would exit without even a sliver of consolation .			0

rangers were beaten by @entity39 in the @entity288
@entity37 opened the scoring for the hosts following a first - half corner
@entity67 own goal doubled the @entity296 ' lead after the break
@entity47 completed the upset that dents @entity301 ' hopes of second place
