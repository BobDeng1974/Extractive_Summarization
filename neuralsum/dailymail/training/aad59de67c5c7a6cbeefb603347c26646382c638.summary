back in september , mr @entity0 also favourited a link to a @entity2 on a similar theme labour frontbencher @entity0 was left red - faced after it emerged he added a @entity2 link to a gay porn website to his list of ‘ favourites ’			1
the shadow policing minister - who is married to labour deputy leader , @entity9 - linked to a tweet about well - endowed black men			1

this was the second occasion on which mr @entity0 ’s finger had strayed on @entity2			1
back in september , mr @entity0 also favourited a link to a @entity2 on a similar theme			1
at the time , the then shadow housing minister dismissed it as a mistake as he and mrs @entity9 had been exploring romantic breaks in @entity27			1
according to the @entity29 political gossip website , mr @entity0 said he had accidentally stumbled on the gay porn website - which featured a character called ‘ @entity27 ’			1
@entity32 covered the story in a diary item , saying : ‘ shadow housing minister @entity0 is the latest victim of this murky world after favouriting a tweet that featured a very different type of outstanding member to that normally found in the parliament			1
’ it is surprisingly easy for @entity2 users to publicise embarrassing searches to all their followers by typing key words into the ‘ @entity2 ’ box rather than the search engine			0
the shadow policing minister - who is married to labour deputy leader , @entity9 - linked to a tweet about well - endowed black men but the revelation could cause tension with his staunchly feminist wife , mrs @entity9 , who has called for the @entity55 newspaper to stop its ‘ sexist ’ pictures of topless women on page three			1
the story was retweeted numerous times after being posted by @entity29 yesterday			0
a @entity62 source said : ‘ this is a technological mix - up and we ’re sure @entity0 will be taking @entity2 lessons to work out the difference between block and favourite as soon as possible			1
’ the @entity69 understands that no one else has access to mr @entity0 ’s account so the tweet can not be blamed on a junior staff member			1
‘ it ’s all very embarrassing			0
he is aware of it			0
it ’s more mix up than conspiracy , ’ one insider said			2
mr @entity0 , a 65 year - old former trade union boss , was elected as the mp for @entity82 in 2010			1
his selection was controversial as the usual all - woman shortlist championed by his wife , was bypassed			2
meanwhile it also emerged that @entity88 ’s official twitter account followed an escort agency			0
the @ @entity91 account was following the @ carltonslondon , which described itself as an ‘ elite @entity94 escort agency ’			0
@entity95 blamed the gaffe on the ‘ auto - follow ’ facility which has been on the account since @entity99 was prime minister			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we have stopped following this particular account			2
prior to 2010 , an auto - follow process was used , meaning that @ @entity91 automatically followed anyone who followed the account			2
‘ this was common practice at the time for many corporate accounts , but was discontinued in 2009			0
‘ as a result of this legacy , the @ @entity91 account follows almost 370,000 accounts and we have taken steps to un-follow as many as possible that are inactive , spam or inappropriate			0
‘ this work is ongoing			0
’ originally , @entity2 users had pointed out that perhaps mr @entity88 had mistaken the escort agency for the @entity117 , an exclusive private members ’ club in @entity94			0
official records showed that more than 300,000 attempts were made to access pornographic website in the houses of @entity123 last year			0
