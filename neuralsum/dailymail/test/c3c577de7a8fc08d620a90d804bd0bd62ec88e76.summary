they may look like as if they come from a plague epidemic , but these photos show the shocking amounts of bacteria that grow on money			2
thousands of bacteria colonies were discovered on banknotes and coins chosen at random from scientists ’ pockets			1
the experiment , which involved treating the coins and notes in a substance that allows bacteria to grow quickly , highlights how dirty handling money can be			1

this the bacteria found on one five pound note the money was collected from students at the @entity24			1
it was then submerged in agar - a substance that allows bacteria to grow quickly - and then monitored for three to four days			2
the students found thousands of bacteria colonies living on their money			1
while most of the colourful blooms and spots of bacteria was found to be harmless , money has been known to carry dangerous diseases			1
the most common type of bacteria they discovered living on our coinage was bacillus mycoides , which is harmless			2
dr @entity41 , a senior lecturer in molecular biology at the university , said : ‘ the most common types found are skin bacteria but money has also been shown to harbour mrsa and food poisoning bacteria in other related studies			1

among the bacteria found on a ten pound note is @entity58 ( shown above )			0
it 's common in soil , so it 's likely someone was gardening before handling cash currency collected from students were submerged in agar - a substance that allows bacteria to grow quickly - and then monitored for three to four days			1
this image shows bacteria found on a ten pound note thousands of bacteria colonies were found living on the sample of money			1
most of the bacteria found on the coins studied was harmless			2
the most common type of bacteria they discovered living on our coinage was bacillus mycoides , which is harmless one ten pound note yielded bacillus mycoides , which is common in soil , suggesting that someone was gardening before handling cash			2
but mrsa and food poisoning bacteria have been found on money in previous studies			1
the scientists found cases of staphylococcus aureus , which can cause boils and spots on the skin			0
it is particularly dangerous to people whose immune systems may not be in peak condition , such as people in hospitals			0
the scientists did find cases of staphylococcus aureus , which can cause boils and spots on the skin			0
it is particularly dangerous to people whose immune systems may not be in peak condition , such as people in hospitals			0
around 20 per cent of people carry the bacteria in their nostrils , which means they likely touched their nose before handling money			0
dr @entity113 added : ‘ we found that money , be it coins or notes , harbours very large numbers of bacteria			1
‘ it is something that we all share so it passes through many many different hands , washed and unwashed			0
' it also gets kept in warm and moist pockets , which offer perfect conditions for bacterial growth and survival			0
‘ consequently , the populations of bacteria on currency are much larger and more diverse , and money is likely to carry disease causing bacteria			0
’ while most of the colourful blooms and spots of bacteria was found to be harmless , money has been known to carry dangerous diseases			1
this is the bacteria found on a five pound note , including one large bloom dr @entity41 , a senior lecturer in molecular biology at the university , said : ‘ the most common types [ of bacteria ] found are skin bacteria but money has also been shown to harbour @entity89 and food poisoning bacteria in other related studies			2
a stock image is shown after the experiment , the cash was washed and returned to the students			0
dr @entity113 said : ‘ we wanted our undergraduates to get familiar with the fact we live in a bacteria world and bacteria is all around us , it ’s on anything we interact with			0
’ the scientists did find cases of staphylococcus aureus , which can cause boils and spots on the skin , but this image shows bacteria from a five pound note , including some bright orange spores dr @entity113 said : ‘ we wanted our undergraduates to get familiar with the fact we live in a bacteria world and bacteria is all around us , it ’s on anything we interact with			0
’ this image shows a large spreading bacterial colony created from the grime on nine silver and copper coins			0

students from the @entity24 discovered thousands of colonies
they submerged coins and notes in agar to *accelerate* growth *pf* bacteria
most were harmless on the money , but one caused boils and spots
previous studies have revealed mrsa bacteria on notes and coins
