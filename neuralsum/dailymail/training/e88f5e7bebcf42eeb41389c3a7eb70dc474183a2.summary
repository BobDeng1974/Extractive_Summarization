even if the debris spotted floating 2,500 kilometres off the @entity2 coastline belongs to the missing @entity4 plane , the mystery of what happened on doomed flight @entity8 might never be unlocked			1
that 's the warning from the world 's leading crash investigation bureau - which investigated the 2009 crash of @entity14 flight 447 - for the 29 planes , 18 ships and six helicopters currently involved in the painstaking search of 600,000 square - kilometres of ocean			2
it would mean the wait is far from over for the heartbroken families of the passengers aboard the @entity26 flight			0
@entity28 - head of @entity30 's @entity29 - said it might take years to recover the plane ’s black box , if it can be recovered at all			1
the @entity30 bureau has dispatched a three - strong team of investigators to @entity26 to assist local authorities in retrieving the plane 's black box recorder , which records sound along with logging the flight 's data , and would unlock the mystery of flight mh370			1
the @entity61 are dropping marker buoys to measure currents and tides to help track the wreckage the search is focused 2,500km off @entity2 's west coast , where satellite images revealed two pieces of debris floating in the open ocean all three were involved in the investigation into the crash of @entity59 , which went down in the @entity74			1
mr @entity47 said despite finding that wreckage within 24 hours of the crash , it took officials two years to retrieve the flight ’s black boxes from the ocean floor			1
the devices were eventually recovered from a depth of 4,000 metres – approximately the same depth as the section of the @entity86 where search parties are working to locate debris believed to belong to flight mh370			2
search teams working to recover the debris from the 2009 @entity14 crash it took investigators two years to recover the black box recorder from the @entity14 crash mr @entity47 said the 2009 investigation was hampered by the size of the search area , with @entity30 authorities unable to locate the recorders despite having a relatively sure idea of where they might be			1
but the search area for @entity8 will be substantially larger , given the debris may have been drifting since the flight 's disappearance on march 8 , and there ’s no way of knowing whether the plane ’s black boxes are anywhere near the rest of the wreckage			1
investigator @entity116 , who headed the @entity30 bureau ’s 2009 search , told the @entity119 that the search @entity8 would be ‘ far , far harder than what we had looking for @entity14 447			2
’ ‘ firstly we had many more clues , ' he said			0
' we knew that the @entity14 plane had a problem , thanks to 24 @entity127 messages sent over four minutes ; we knew its precise location four minutes before impact , which allowed us to reduce our search zone to only 40 nautical miles			0
‘ that is nothing compared to the surface area of today 's search			2
’ a @entity61 @entity135 takes off from @entity137 air base to help continue the search the 63 - year - old said merely finding the debris would be the first step in a long investigation into locating the plane 's black box recorder , which could be up to 150 miles away from the wreckage			1
' objects that have drifted for two weeks will have traveled a long way in that time , ' he said			0
' if you have currents at four knots , that mean four nautical miles per day and a considerable distance in 14 days			0
' but the crash expert said the debris would at least begin to paint a picture of what happened aboard @entity26 flight mh370			0
' after you have identified and examined some debris , you can piece together how the plane broke up , ' he said			0
' was it in the air , was it during a sea landing , or did it hit the ocean surface ? from that you can build up a scenario			0

@entity30 air crash body warns mystery of doomed flight still years away from being solved
*organisation* 's chief @entity172 says locating debris is just the beginning
it took investigators two years to recover the black box from crashed @entity59 , despite having a much smaller area of ocean to search
mr @entity47 says families should brace for the *possibility* that the black box recorder will never be found
