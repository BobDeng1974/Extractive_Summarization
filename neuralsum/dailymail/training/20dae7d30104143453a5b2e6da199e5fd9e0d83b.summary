low socio - economic status : the woman was buried in a grave covered with tiles called tegulae - a common form of burial in the @entity7 era the body of a @entity7 woman with a tumour in her pelvis embedded with four deformed teeth and a bone has been uncovered by archaeologists			1
the 30 - something woman , whose body was interred in a necropolis near @entity19 , in the @entity21 region of @entity22 , died some 1,600 years ago , researchers believe			1
an examination of the corpse revealed she suffered from a condition known to doctors as an ovarian teratoma - a @entity29 - derived term meaning , roughly , a ' monster swelling in the ovaries '			1
such tumours stem from mutations of the germ cells which form human eggs ; they have the potential to create hair , teeth and bone - or even more complex organs like eyes			2
it is understood that it is the first time scientists have found this type of teratoma in human remains dating back to ancient times			1
' this is an extraordinary case , not only for its antiquity , but also its identification in the archaeological record , ' wrote the researchers in a study published recently in the @entity54 of @entity55			0
despite its gruesome contents , it 's possible that the bizarre tumour , which is about 1.7 inches in diameter at its largest point , never caused the woman any symptoms , the researchers note			1
however , they add , its also possible that it was the ultimate cause of her untimely death , since ' sometimes the development of teratomas results in displacement and functional disturbances of adjacent organs '			2
other possible fatal effects of the tumour could have been infections , hemolytic anemia and pregnancy complications , the team noted			0
@entity55 : a close - up of the pelvic region of the skeleton discovered in the @entity7 necropolis in @entity21			1
the arrow points to the calcified tumour embedded in her pelvis ' monster swelling in the ovaries ' : this look inside the woman 's ovarian teratoma reveals the inner protuberance with two teeth attached - a further two teeth have been removed the tumour would not have been outwardly obvious , however , and researchers admit they ca n't tell for certain what effect it had on the woman			1
lead researcher @entity101 , of the @entity102 , told @entity103 : ' we suppose that , at least during a long part of her life , she was completely unaware of this tumor			0
' she said that ' depending on the eventual complications , she could have suffered ' but that there is no evidence of that			0
' she could have died because of many other causes ! ' ms @entity101 added			0
the owner of the tumour lived in a period when the @entity7 was in sharp decline as barbarian invaders flooded in from the north , eventually overrunning @entity121 , @entity22 and other territories			1
' @entity124 case ' : a ct scan image of the tumour ( 0.3 mm ) confirming the presence of complete teeth and several calcified septa			0
the tumour is about 1.7 inches in diameter at its largest point she was gound in a necropolis with only a few artefacts buried with her			2
tiles known as tegulae had been put over her to give her grave a kind of gabled roof ' @entity141 were the most common @entity7 burials , ' said ms @entity101			2
' she was not an important or rich person			0
she had a low socio - economic status			0

body of 30 - something @entity7 woman with an ovarian teratoma uncovered in a @entity150 necropolis
she died 1,600 years ago , but the tumour may not have been the ultimate cause of her death
it is thought to be the first time such a tumour has been discovered in a corpse that dates back to ancient times
