by @entity0 @entity1 has been named in @entity3 's 23 - man squad for @entity4 despite suffering from a knee injury			1
the @entity8 striker 's @entity6 was thrown into doubt after undergoing minor surgery a fortnight ago , but coach @entity11 knows the 27 - year - old is pivotal to the @entity3 team			1
it means the @entity16 's top goalscorer could be back in time to face @entity17 on june 19			2
there were claims @entity1 sustained the injury on @entity8 's last game of the season , provoking online death threats to be sent to @entity78 's @entity77 from @entity3 fans			0
but if @entity11 needs to rely on his back - up strikers , then he should have little worries			0
@entity82 forward @entity65 and @entity62 striker @entity61 have also been named , in what looks a frighteningly good mix up front for @entity3			0
@entity8 's @entity39 , on loan at @entity88 , was also picked for the final squad			1
as was @entity35 's @entity34 and @entity57 's @entity56			1
@entity90 and @entity91 have been dropped from his provisional squad			0
@entity3 's first match comes against @entity94 on june 15 , before they face @entity17 in @entity95 four days later			0
fit ? the surgery was said to keep @entity1 out for at least two weeks but being named is a boost for @entity3 on the mend : @entity1 will be pivotal to @entity3 's @entity6 hopes , even with @entity61 and @entity65 as back up			2

@entity1 named in final @entity3 squad despite undergoing 30 - minute anthroscopic surgery
@entity35 's @entity34 , @entity8 's @entity39 and @entity57 's @entity56 also named
@entity65 and @entity61 other strike options for coach @entity11
@entity3 face @entity17 on june 19
