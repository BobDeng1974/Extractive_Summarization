@entity2 pupils lag behind their counterparts in the @entity4 because they spend considerably less time doing homework , a new analysis suggests			1
international research spanning 65 countries shows a clear link between time spent on homework and higher academic performance			1
teenagers who put in the most homework hours tended to do better in an international maths test , according to the study , which is one of the biggest ever carried out into homework patterns			1
@entity2 pupils lag behind their counterparts in the @entity4 because they spend considerably less time doing homework , a new analysis suggests it also revealed that @entity2 15 - year - olds complete a fraction of the homework of peers in @entity26 nations which regularly take top spots in international maths rankings			1
@entity2 teenagers spend 4.9 hours a week doing homework – substantially less than the 13.8 clocked up by counterparts in @entity32 , @entity33			1
the city , the biggest in @entity33 , came first in last year ’s international table of teenagers ’ maths performance in 65 countries and regions produced by the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , which also carried out the homework study			1
in @entity43 , which came second in the table , average homework hours are 9.4 , while in @entity46 , which came third , pupils put in six hours			2
@entity2 – whose homework hours are the same as the international average - came an undistinguished 26th in the table , which is based on results in the so - called @entity54 test ( @entity54 ) , given to 15 - year - olds in participating countries every three years			1
the study also found that @entity2 has one of the highest totals of pupils who do no homework at all			1
teenagers in @entity32 , @entity33 , came top of the @entity40 's list - clocking up 13.8 hours of homework every week and the country has one of the largest gaps between pupils from middle - class and disadvantaged backgrounds in the amount of homework time clocked up			1
the @entity40 concluded that spending more time on homework could influence the results of individual pupils and schools			2
the benefit to pupils of attending a school which sets lots of homework could equate to six months of schooling , the research suggested			2
but the @entity40 was unable to say that adopting more homework as a national policy would drive up a country ’s performance in the rankings			1
it said that other factors – such as the quality of teaching – were likely to be more crucial to the achievement of a country as a whole			0
the study said : ‘ the amount of time students spend doing homework is related to their individual performance in @entity54 and to their school ’s @entity54 performance : students who spend more time doing homework tend to score higher in @entity54 , as do their schools			2
but it added : ‘ while the amount of homework assigned is associated with mathematics performance among students and schools , other factors are more important in determining the performance of school systems as a whole			2
‘ the average number of hours that students spend on homework or other study set by teachers tends to be unrelated to the school system ’s overall performance			2
@entity122 showed that other factors , such as the quality of instruction and how schools are organised , have a greater impact on a school system ’s overall performance ‘ this implies that other factors , such as the quality of instruction and how schools are organised , have a greater impact on a school system ’s overall performance			0
’ this may explain why @entity136 , which came 12th in the maths table , sets the lowest level of weekly homework among countries studied , at just 2.8 hours			1
experts said , however , the implications for individual pupils were clear			0
‘ these findings should finally silence sceptics who have argued that homework is bad for youngsters , causing stress and division in families , ’ said professor @entity144 , of the @entity145 at the @entity146			0
‘ homework is clearly very important to reinforce lessons that are learnt at school			0
it is worrying that in this country there are lots of 15 - year - olds who are not doing any homework at all , ’ he told the @entity154			1
‘ it is a failure of schools if they are not setting and enforcing homework			0
the best schools set it , mark it and hand it back quickly and make a fuss if it is n’t done			0
’ he suggested that 15 - year - olds should be doing 1.5 hours a night of homework , five nights a week			1
‘ that gives young people time to size up the problem and put in the effort , check it and then have some time to develop their hobbies later in the evening , ’ he said			0
the research will add to intense debate about the role of homework amid claims by some contributors to parenting website that it should be banned , at least in primary school			0
@entity188 , co-founder of @entity189 , said she wanted to see schools doing more to lean on pupils to complete their homework instead of expecting parents to police it			0
‘ if schools are serious about homework parents will support it , but it should not all be left to parents to make it happen			0
where parents get really frustrated is where they feel they are battling alone to enforce it , ’ she said			0
the study prompted the @entity40 to call on schools to offer classrooms where pupils could work after school and help parents motivate children to finish their homework before surfing the web			2
@entity208 , @entity40 education director , said : ‘ one good way to make sure that homework does n’t perpetuate differences in performance that are related to students ’ socio - economic status is for schools and teachers to encourage struggling and disadvantaged students to complete their homework			1
‘ this could involve providing facilities at school so that disadvantaged students have a quiet , comfortable place to work , and / or offering to help parents motivate their children to finish their homework before going out with friends or surfing the web			0
the homework still has to get done ; but maybe students and their parents will find it a little less troublesome			0

research spanning 65 countries shows clear link to academic performance
teenagers who did most homework scored higher in maths tests
@entity2 teenagers did 4.9 hours a week - putting them 26th on @entity40 list
@entity243 were 15 - year - olds from @entity32 who do 13.8 hours each week
