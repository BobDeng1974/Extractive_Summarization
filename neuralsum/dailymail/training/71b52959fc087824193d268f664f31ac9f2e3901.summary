the @entity7 ' game against @entity8 at @entity9 on @entity10 was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch which allowed the @entity2 to leapfrog them by one point with their 2 - 0 home win over @entity14			1
the @entity16 club have a chance to extend that lead to four points against @entity20 on sunday and @entity21 could also be above @entity3 if they beat @entity8 on the same day , before the champions travel to @entity23 on monday night			1
@entity3 boss @entity0 leads his players in training ahead of their monday night clash with @entity23 however , @entity0 , disappointed that the @entity8 game was off - ' we were ready to play and wanted to play ' - is relaxed about a situation few would have envisaged at the start of the season when it was widely assumed that , in the continuing absence from the top flight of traditional rivals @entity33 , the @entity7 would proceed unhindered to their fourth successive title			1
the @entity3 boss said : ' i 'm not concerned about that			1
' it is in our hands and if we win our games we are the champions and that is what we want to do			1
' we are not halfway through ( league campaign ) yet so there are a lot of games to go			2

' the @entity75 squad jet out to @entity76 for a winter break following their trip to @entity80			0
having postponed their match against @entity14 on january 10 , @entity0 's side could fall further behind in the title race			1
however , the @entity84 believes @entity3 's experience of winning the title over the past three seasons will stand them in good stead in the second - half of the campaign			1
hoops forward @entity91 is a january target for @entity94 side @entity93 he said : ' that is very important , to know the demands and know how to focus when things are tight and that is something that there is a lot of in this squad			0
' we have the experience of this			0
it is about us and if we win every game we will win the league			2
' so it is up to us			0
we ca n't think about what the other teams are doing			0
