' not here though , right ? ' ' you 're , like , a legit nurse ? ' ' this is awkward			0
' yes , no and absolutely , but it was all for a good cause as @entity7 prank video group @entity5 took on the taboo nature of testicular exams			1
their video stars @entity12 , an attractive woman in a novelty nurse 's uniform and armed with a supply of rubber gloves and the offer to perform touch tests on men 's genitals			2
for every taker , the group pledged to donate $ 100 ( £ 64 ) to the @entity24 campaign and for every 100,000 views their video received over 30 days they would donate the same amount again			1
@entity12 , of the @entity7 prankster group @entity5 offers free testicle exams on @entity29 street after a sheepish response from passers - by , one man is up for the free ( if not qualified ) check - up @entity12 dons a fresh rubber glove and performs a check she says every man should do for themselves not surprisingly , the @entity29 street they chose to patrol with their sign simply labelled ' @entity41 ' there were plenty of skeptical blokes			1
comments such as the ' i just have a passion for testicles ' , in jest of course , no doubt did n't help			0
and of course there was a combination of curious looks from those wandering by and other taking out their camera phones to record the moment			0
this man 's willingness to participate made a further $ 100 for @entity24 some men were more willing than others to show their face during the exam though it was a public street the man unzips and does his bit for the charity that raises money and awareness for testicular cancer but there were six takers , meaning $ 600 ( £ 383 ) for the @entity24 campaign , and five days after the video was first posted there have been more than 3.5million views on their official @entity78 means a total ticking well over $ 4,100 ( £ 2,600 )			1
' in all seriousness , we did this video to show that you are just as qualified as i am to give yourself a thorough examination , ' @entity12 says at the end of the clip			2
' so , i want you to do it right now [ as her two colleagues oblige ]			0
so if you notice any lumps or swelling , visit your doctor immediately .			0
