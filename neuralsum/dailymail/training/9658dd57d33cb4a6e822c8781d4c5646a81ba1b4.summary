by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:38 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 11:00 est , 13 may 2013 eurosceptic @entity4 mps could stand under a joint ticket with @entity7 @entity6 , @entity2 revealed today			1
the @entity6 leader suggested his party ’s logo could appear on the ballot paper alongside conservative candidates as a seal of approval for mps who back his party ’s position on @entity19			1
but he stressed that the endorsement would be done on an individual basis , ruling out an election pact unless @entity23 is replaced as leader			1
@entity6 leader @entity2 suggested he would welcome @entity4 defections with open arms , as he offered the @entity6 logo to @entity29 candidates the @entity30 are embroiled in serious turmoil over the issue of @entity19 , and mr @entity23 ’s promise to renegotiate links with @entity35 before holding an in - out referendum by 2017			1
mr @entity2 suggested the @entity30 have an ‘ issue of trust ’ after failing to deliver a vote on the @entity38			2
mr @entity23 , who is on a visit to the @entity42 , has been forced to deal with @entity4 cabinet ministers saying they would vote to leave the @entity44 if there was a referendum tomorrow , as dozens of backbenchers prepare to vote against the @entity48 in an unprecedented revolt on wednesday			1
many in conservative ranks have been spooked by the rise of @entity6 , which two weeks ago took almost one in four votes in the local elections			2
it @entity6 has held talks with several @entity15 about possibly defecting before the next election			0
but today mr @entity2 revealed he could offer the @entity6 ‘ pound sign ’ logo to endorse some @entity4 mps at the next election			1
he told @entity62 : ‘ the law now allows one candidate to have the logo of more than one party [ on a ballot paper ] , so legally if someone wanted to stand as a @entity4 - @entity6 candidate or even a @entity71 - @entity6 candidate that would be allowed under electoral law			2
’ a request from a @entity4 mp to use the @entity6 emblem would be discussed by the @entity6 local association ‘ and we ’d go from there ’ , mr @entity2 added			1
@entity23 is in @entity78 for talks with @entity42 president @entity80 , but the trip has been overshadowed by questions over @entity4 splits back home over @entity19 mr @entity2 said the @entity4 party will go on being ‘ hopelessly split ’ unless an in - out referendum is held before the 2015 election			1
as a result @entity6 could not do a deal with mr @entity23 in charge			2
‘ i think the dam has broken			0
i think the politics that dare not speak its name has now become mainstream and you ’re going to see a lot more voices coming out over the next few months saying that the time has come for us to leave			0
‘ nobody could do a deal with a party that is completely spilt and it ’s difficult to ascertain what its position is			0
‘ i ’ve said all the way through that if someone like a @entity107 [ @entity108 ] or a @entity109 was leading the conservative party we ’d certainly be prepared to have a conversation			0
please do n’t think that @entity6 is just here as a fringe of the conservative party			0
‘ we took a lot of @entity71 and @entity117 votes two weeks ago and that ’s something in this debate that tends to get forgotten			0
’ we 're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable .			0
