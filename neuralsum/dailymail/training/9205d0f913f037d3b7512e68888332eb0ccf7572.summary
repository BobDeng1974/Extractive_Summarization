but he started vomiting and collapsed in front of the store shortly after			1
dr @entity50 , a professor of entomology at the @entity52 , said it could have been an allergic reaction to the large amount of foreign protein that killed the 32 - year - old			2
he told the @entity40 : ' we know cockroaches shed a lot of allergens , but they ’re not toxic in and of themselves			2
' very few [ human ] cultures tend to eat cockroaches because they store large amounts of uric acid and nitrogenous waste			2
