by @entity0 last updated at 9:04 am on 20th december 2011 three senior judges yesterday slapped down campaigners who tried to stop library closures			2
the appeal judges said it was ‘ fanciful ’ to claim that shutting six @entity9 libraries would disadvantage @entity7 communities			1
the decision means @entity11 can go ahead with its plan to close down the libraries in the teeth of the campaign fronted by celebrity authors and a string of pop stars			2
under threat : @entity20 , pictured , is one of six that could face closure it will also influence the attitude of judges towards other local campaigns to save libraries and prevent cutbacks by councils			2
in recent weeks decisions by two councils to make cuts in social care spending have been overturned by @entity35 judges			0
in another case a high court judge ruled that @entity39 council could not close libraries because to do so would disadvantage minority groups and break its ‘ equality duties ’			1
earlier this month lord chief justice lord judge expressed frustration at the enthusiasm of some of his colleagues for interfering with local council decisions , saying that ‘ we have to be careful to remember that we ca n’t administer the responsibilities which others have			2
’ @entity53 campaigners were supported by celebrities including children ’s author @entity55 and playwright @entity57 , and pop stars @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , the @entity62 and @entity63			1
supportive : from left to right , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 have backed the campaign their lawyers said that the borough had ‘ failed to have due regard to the risk of indirect discrimination against @entity7 residents ’			0
nearly half the library borrowers are @entity7 , they said			0
they also said the borough was not providing an efficient library service as provided by law and had informed people of its plans too late			0
but @entity85 said in yesterday ’s decision that @entity53 had acted properly in making cuts and ‘ the decision to do so followed @entity89 and local decisions properly taken , decisions which were primarily for democratically elected bodies			1
’ he added : ‘ it is fanciful to suggest , taking the best view one can of the evidence , that it was so obvious that library provision , as distinct from other services , had discriminatory effects upon the @entity7 community			0
’ @entity85 added : given the scale of the spending reductions the council was required to make , a decision that the library service should bear a share of the reduction was not , in my judgement , unlawful			0
’ campaigners said they were thinking of taking their case to the @entity112			1
their solicitor , @entity113 , of law firm @entity114 , said : ‘ the @entity116 ruling is very difficult to reconcile with what @entity117 intended when it enacted the equality duty that obliges @entity53 , and all other local authorities , to properly grapple with the impact withdrawal of local services of this kind has on communities			1
authors @entity55 , left and @entity57 right are among the famous faces supporting the @entity128 campaign group ‘ the @entity116 appears to accept that there is a risk of indirect discrimination against significant numbers of people in @entity53 resulting from its plans to impose devastating cuts on local library services , but it has excused the council from properly taking that risk into account before deciding to make those cuts			1
‘ our position is that this is simply wrong in principle			0
' if the @entity112 is willing to hear this case , we anticipate the outcome being very different			1
’ @entity147 of campaign group @entity148 said : ‘ our legal team presented compelling evidence of damage to communities from @entity11 ’s library closures , so we are disappointed that the appeal judges have not found in our favour			0
‘ closing half of our libraries has had a devastating effect on the most vulnerable members of our community , among them children and families , the elderly , the disabled and those unemployed or on low incomes			0
@entity53 has always had the means to keep these libraries open , it just lacks the will			1
the overwhelming strength of public feeling over the last year shows that communities need , want and will support local libraries			0

@entity53 council plans to shut down six libraries in @entity9
campaigners say they will consider taking case to the @entity112
