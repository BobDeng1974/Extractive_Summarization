senators lashed out at secretary of state @entity1 on wednesday during a hearing about @entity4 's response to the @entity6 terror army , as lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle agreed that the @entity11 administration needs a new approval from @entity13 if it plans to continue bombing raids and other ' offense ' measures past the end of the month			1
the @entity17 is operating under the authority of the @entity19 , which allows the president to wage war for 90 days in the face of a national security threat without going to @entity24 for permission			0
that period expires in a few weeks , but the administration plans to rely on a @entity29 - era @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , granted by @entity13 in 2001 , to continue			2
' you 're going to need a new @entity27 , and it 'll have to be more tailored , ' @entity31 sen. @entity30 of @entity32 , the @entity34 's chairman , told @entity1			1
his @entity37 counterpart , ranking @entity37 sen. @entity38 of @entity39 , was far more aggressive , barking that president @entity11 and a coterie of supportive senators ' are exercising terrible judgment right now ' by deploying @entity4 's military in @entity44 ' regardless of what we say			1
' the 2001 @entity27 specifically authorized the government to attack @entity63 inside @entity44			0
now the administration is attacking @entity6 , the self - proclaimed @entity65 , and has pledged to pursue the terror group into @entity67 if necessary			2
' taking us into another country with a different enemy is exercising the worst judgment possible , ' @entity38 said			0
@entity1 insisted that he favors a new congressional authorization for the @entity11 administration			1
' we 're asking you to do it , ' he said			0
' but @entity38 said @entity1 was ' asking us to do it , but you 're not giving any details because you do n't have them			1
' @entity1 insisted that the administration would wait to share more information with @entity13 until retired general @entity83 , the president 's special envoy , had a chance to run elbows with potential partner states during an upcoming @entity89 meeting			1
' do you realize how unserious the things that you have laid out , and the things that were laid out yesterday , sound ? ' @entity38 asked			2
' it seems like a – it seems like a political answer			0
' ' i hope you 'll lay out a plan that will convince us that you 're serious about doing the things you said you 're going to do , to the @entity4 people and to us , about @entity65 , ' he continued			0
' because you have n't done it now			0
' the fast - moving @entity6 episode saw several new developments on wednesday			2
the @entity106 approved a measure that would provide funds for a train - and - equip mission designed to help ' moderate ' @entity67 rebel groups battle both @entity6 and the country 's dictator , @entity111			2
meet the press : @entity1 insisted on wednesday that the @entity115 's praise of his coalition - building efforts in @entity44 were ample proof that the @entity17 's strategy is working the normally taciturn secretary of state verbally body - slammed the female - dominated @entity121 protest group on wednesday for protecting @entity6 as it rapes and pillages its way across @entity44 and @entity67 and disagreements continued to swirl over whether a ground incursion will ultimately have to be part of president @entity11 's wartime toolbox			1
@entity17 minority leader @entity128 insisted that her position was a ‘ blanket " no " , ' mirroring the pledge the president made hours earlier to an audience of servicemen and women at @entity136 in @entity137			0
but former defense secretary @entity138 claimed that the @entity4 will need to put boots on the ground if there is ‘ to be any hope of success			0
' earlier in wednesday 's hearing , @entity1 deviated from his prepared testimony to rake the far - left female - dominated protest group @entity121 over the coals for objecting to the @entity4 government 's military involvement in an @entity151 campaign			1
the terror group , he said , ' is killing and raping and mutilating women			1
' ' they 're cold - blooded killers marauding across the @entity157 , making a mockery of a peaceful religion , ' @entity1 said of the @entity161 terror army			2
like tuesday 's hearing before the @entity164 , the @entity34 hearing was preceded by a handful of the group 's activists holding signs and shouting anti-war slogans in the hearing room			2
@entity1 said he respected their right to protest , but took time out to upbraid them personally for standing in the @entity11 administration 's way			1
@entity1 blasted @entity121 activists for aiding ' cold - blooded killers marauding across the @entity157 , making a mockery of a peaceful religion ' not impressed : senators from both side of the aisle had doubts on wednesday about the mechanics and goals of the @entity11 administration 's approach to fighting @entity6 , and the legal justification for waging war without permission from @entity13 after reading the first four paragraphs of a five - page prepared statement , the norally taciturn @entity1 launched into an impromptu offensive against the protesters			1
' you know , as i came in here , obviously we had some folks who spoke out			0
and i would start by saying that i understand dissent			0
i 've lived it , ' he said , referring to his leadership of @entity204 nearly 40 years ago			0
' that 's how i first testified in front of this country in 1971			0
' but @entity121 , he said , ' was started by a woman , or women , who were opposed to war but who also thought that government 's job was to take care of people , give them health care , and education , and good jobs			1
' ' and if that 's what you believe in , and i believe it is , then you ought to care about fighting @entity65 , ' he said , referring to @entity6 by the alternative name preferred by the @entity11 administration			1
' because @entity65 is killing and raping and mutilating women			1
and they believe women should n't have an education			0
they sell off girls to be sex slaves to jihadists			0
' @entity121 is the brainchild of @entity234 , a wealthy @entity235 peace activist who was herself arrested in march during a visit to @entity237 while en route to a women 's rights conference in @entity239			2
the @entity241 agitator claimed later that she suffered a dislocated shoulder and a broken arm as @entity245 airport police in the @entity247 - run capital city restrained her			0
@entity1 emphasized that ' there is nothing to negotiate ' with @entity6			2
' they 're not offering anyone health care of any kind			0
they 're not offering education of any kind , ' he said , addressing the protesters in the room			0
@entity1 insisted that the @entity11 administration 's strategy will stop @entity6 ' from denying the women and the girls and the people of @entity44 the very future that they yearn for ' @entity234 was arrested on july 30 during a civil - disobedience protest in front of the @entity268 embassy in @entity269 , @entity264 was protesting the deaths of @entity271 in @entity239 @entity272 was last seen tuesday in a different @entity34 hearing , shouting slogans before secretary of defense @entity275 and @entity278 chairman gen. @entity277 testified about the war on @entity6 ' for a whole philosophy , or idea , or cult – whatever you want to call it – that frankly comes out of the stone age , they 're cold - blooded killers marauding across the @entity157 , making a mockery of a peaceful religion			1
' ' and that 's precisely why we are building a coalition to try to stop them from denying the women and the girls and the people of @entity44 the very future that they yearn for , ' @entity1 said			1
' and frankly , @entity121 and a lot of other people need to stop and think about how you stop them and deal with that			0
' in response , a protester shouted five times , as police led her out : ' your invasion will not protect the homeland ! ' after his opening statement , ranking @entity38 senator @entity38 challenged @entity1 for presiding over a ' political answer ' to @entity157 unrest that 's an ' unserious ' path to defeating @entity6			1
sen. @entity311 , a @entity313 @entity312 who is among the panel 's most liberal members , echoed @entity1 's outrage			1
@entity6 , she said , ' is selling 14 - year - olds ' and ' giving them as gifts to their fighters			1
' ' they say , " if you do n't take our twisted version of @entity322 , you either flee , you convert , or you die			0

@entity31 sen. @entity30 told the secretary of state that the @entity11 administration needs a new ' authorization ' to continue military operations
@entity37 sen. @entity38 called @entity1 's coalition - building approach to war ' unserious ' and *accused* him of *hiding* the ball while @entity13 chases its tail
@entity1 confronted far - left anti-war protesters who *interrupted* the proceedings , for *effectively* assisting @entity6 with their *rhetoric*
@entity6 jihadists are ' killing and raping and mutilating women , ' he told the female - dominated @entity121 group , ' and they believe women should n't have an education '
@entity31 senator @entity311 echoed @entity1 , saying @entity6 ' is selling 14 - year - olds ' and ' giving them as gifts to their fighters '
