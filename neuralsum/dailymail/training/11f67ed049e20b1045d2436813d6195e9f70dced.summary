by @entity0 published : 06:18 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:23 est , 26 february 2014 a retired caretaker who rides a mobility scooter customised to look like a @entity5 has told how he is repeatedly pulled over by police - for riding a motorcycle on the pavement			1
@entity9 , a 64 - year - old from @entity10 in @entity11 , says he is fed - up with officers mistaking his £ 6,000 electric scooter for the on - the - road version it had been designed to look like			1
nicknamed ' the @entity16 ' by his neighbours , mr @entity9 says his three - wheeled vehicle is fully legal to ride on the pavement as it is limited to a top speed of just four miles per hour			1
young at heart : @entity9 , 64 , says he is fed - up with officers mistaking his £ 6,000 customised electric scooter for a @entity5 motorcycle as he rides around the streets of @entity10 in @entity11 customised : the eccentric vehicle , which cost £ 6,000 , has been set to a top speed of just four miles per hour , which means mr @entity9 is regularly overtaken by ' little old ladies ' with their machines on ' road mode ' mr @entity9 says he is repeatedly pulled over for potentially breaking the law by riding on the pavement and has even been tracked down in cafes after parking his machine outside			1
the father - of - three says officers soon back down when they take a closer look at his eccentric vehicle , however			2
describing the customised machine , mr @entity9 says : ' i was told i had to get a mobility scooter so i went to a local store , but all i saw were pink things with baskets on the front - i really was n't impressed			1
' ' the woman in the shop asked me what i would be interested in so i told her i wanted something that would go off - road and that looked like a @entity5			2
' ' just because you are old and disabled does n't mean you ca n't be cool too ... they hunted around and showed me the one they had found			0
' ' some people call me ' the @entity16 ' and that 's fine - it 's only rock n ' roll but i like it			2
' mr @entity9 got the scooter last summer after he was diagnosed with @entity59 - a condition that kills his nerves and has left him unable to control his legs			1
but he was horrified by the thought of getting an ' old fashioned ' scooter designed for pensioners and approached his local retailer to ask if they could source something different			0
night rider : nicknamed ' the @entity16 ' by his neighbours , mr @entity9 says his three - wheeled vehicle is fully legal to ride on the pavement as it is has a top speed of just four miles per hour getting around : mr @entity9 says he is repeatedly pulled over for potentially breaking the law by riding on the pavement and has even been tracked down in cafes after parking his machine outside comparison : police officers in @entity10 have repeatedly mistaken @entity9 's mobility scooter for a road - going @entity5 motorcycle ( pictured ) the @entity84 model he purchased features chrome - style forks and handlebars and a large central headlight like a motorbike			1
his unusual mode of transport quickly attracted the attention of the local police , however			0
he said : ' i was driving along the pavement when a police car drove past me then quickly spun around and pulled over			0
' ' when they got out the car one of them was nudging the other and they were laughing ... one of them said ' sorry , brains over here thought you were riding a motorbike on the pavement '			0
afterwards they just kept pushing each other and laughing , ' he added			0
although police in @entity11 repeatedly mistake @entity9 's mobility scooter for a @entity5 , the only real comparison between the two vehicles is their appearance			1
while the @entity5 can comfortably reach a top speed of 110mph , mr @entity9 's scooter is limited to just 4mph in order to make it legal to drive on the pavement			1
it is , however , capable of reaching 8mph if its engine is switched from ' street mode ' to ' road mode '			0
mr @entity9 says this is the setting many ' little old ladies ' in the town of @entity10 are using when they speed past his customised scooter			1
the @entity132 vehicle is powered by a 100ah 12v x 2 battery which last for between 30 and 32 hours of continuous riding between charges			0
the ' fat boy ' , on the other hand , has a classic air - cooled , six - speed engine which sits on the outside of the bike and helps make it instantly recognisable as a @entity5			0
when it comes to braking ability , a @entity142 ' uses four - piston front brakes and two - piston rear brakes which allow it to reduce speed safely and comfortably			0
although mr @entity9 's @entity150 comes to an equally luxurious halt , it needs only a small electromagnetic brake to slow down , with much of the speed control influenced by the opening and closing of the throttle			1
finally there is a huge difference in price between the two vehicles , with a brand new @entity5 ' fat boy ' costing a minimum £ 15,995			0
the @entity150 , meanwhile , can be bought for as little as £ 3,500 if you are n't interested in additional customisation work			0
not tearing up the neighbourhood : mr @entity9 said that a police officer once came up to him while he was drinking coffee in a cafe and asked to take a photo of the vehicle easy mistake : @entity9 says police who repeatedly mistake his scooter for a @entity5 soon back down when they take a closer look describing why he purchased the customised machine , mr @entity9 said : ' i was told i had to get a mobility scooter so i went to a local store , but all i saw were pink things with baskets on the front - i was n't impressed ' mr @entity9 said that on another occasion a different police officer came up to him while he was drinking coffee in a cafe as he had left the vehicle parked outside			1
' he was going to tell me off for parking on the pavement but then he realised his mistake and asked if they could take a picture of it instead , ' mr @entity9 said			1
mr @entity9 says he has now become something of a local celebrity and has even earned his own nickname			1
he said : ' people around here think it 's great - they all call me the ' @entity16 ' - people are always stopping me and asking for a picture			2
' ' having this mobility scooter has really changed my life , i was so against the idea of amobility scooter at first and now they ca n't get me off it , ' he added			2
' i 've got my speed set to four miles per hour which is walking speed , so quite often little old ladies who have left ' road mode ' on come speeding right past me in their pink scooters with baskets - it 's very funny			0
' mr @entity9 's vehicle can theoretically reach eight miles per hour but has had its top speed limited			2
he says his vehicle is battery powered and can go about 32 miles on a single charge , allowing him to visit the nearby @entity221 to take photographs			0
' it has really given me my mobility back - i would n't be able to get anywhere without it now , ' he said			0
mr @entity9 says that , as well as making him feel cool , his choice in mobility scooter had made others feel better about using them			1
he said : ' there is a young lad down the road who for some reason or another needed a mobility scooter ... he really did n't like the idea but then he saw mine and he could n't wait to get one			2
' ' if you 're still young at heart and you need a mobility scooter then you should get one likethis , ' he added .			0

@entity9 , 64 , says he is tired of being pulled over by police officers
police regularly mistake father - of - three 's mobility scooter for a motorbike
he spent £ 6,000 on the customised *replica* of a road - going @entity5
mr @entity9 is from @entity10 in @entity11 and has nickname : ' @entity16 '
