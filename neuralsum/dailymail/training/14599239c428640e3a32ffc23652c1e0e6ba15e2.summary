public hospitals in @entity1 are concerned enough about @entity2 that they 've secretly been sending actors with mock symptoms into emergency rooms to test how good the triage staff is at identifying and isolating possible cases			1
a small hospital in the @entity10 countryside has hung up signs , imploring patients to let nurses know immediately if they have traveled recently to @entity14			1
and across the @entity18 , one of the nation 's largest ambulance companies has put together step - by - step instructions on how to wrap the interior of a rig with plastic sheeting while transporting a patient			1
pictured is @entity28 , displaying an isolation room which could be used for an @entity2 patient protected : the workers wear helmets and layers of protective gear to fend off any potential infection @entity2 has yet to infect a single person on @entity18 soil — the one confirmed case here involves a man who contracted the virus overseas			1
but health care providers are worried enough that they are taking a wide variety of precautions			2
it is n't yet clear whether those preparations are overkill , or not nearly enough			0
but medical officials and health experts say that , at the very least , the scare is giving them a chance to reinforce and test infection control procedures			1
' the attention has been , in a sad way , very helpful , ' said dr. @entity54 , an epidemiologist at @entity55 and a former president of the @entity57			0
he said even small hospitals far from hubs of international travel should be reviewing their protocols and screening questions now , and potentially buying protective equipment such as face masks and protective suits , to avoid a repeat of the problems that occurred at a hospital in @entity69 , where a man with @entity2 was sent home — only to be readmitted two days later			1
screening : passengers from the @entity2 heartlands in @entity14 will now be tested on arrival at airports including @entity1 's @entity76 ( pictured ) ' the debacle in @entity78 should stimulate improved awareness and responses , ' @entity54 said			1
hospitals around the country are already getting ample opportunities to test their infection control procedures due to a growing number of false alarms			2
in @entity1 , 24 patients have been put into isolation over the past eight weeks in city - owned hospitals because of fears they might have @entity2 , according to dr. @entity92 , the chief medical officer at the @entity93			1
none had the disease ( some patients had malaria and one had typhoid ) , but @entity92 said the point has been to isolate possible cases quickly so there is no chance for the virus to spread			2
' we 're taking this very seriously , ' he said			0
safety first : staff at @entity109 put on protective gloves after being given classes on dealing with @entity2 some staff has been retrained on how to properly put on and remove protective gear			2
at the city 's flagship public hospital , @entity28 , technicians are assembling a lab that will exclusively handle @entity2 blood tests so that samples wo n't contaminate equipment in other parts of the hospital			1
a small number of beds have been set up in an isolation ward for taking confirmed cases			2
so far , nobody has had to use it			0
@entity130 911 operators have been told to ask certain people calling for an ambulance whether they 've been to @entity14 recently			2
that question is also becoming the norm at @entity135 , which operates private ambulances in 40 states			0
it has told its staff of 19,000 paramedics and @entity141 that patients with certain symptoms should be asked about travel to certain parts of @entity14			1
if they answer yes , emergency service workers are supposed to don extra protective gear , including shoe coverings , a mask and goggles , and alert health authorities that the patient might have @entity2			1
' we do n't want to respond with a presumption that everyone in the field has @entity2 , ' said dr. @entity157 , @entity135 's chief medical officer			2
but he said extra precautions are warranted			0
' the idea is , if the travel question is positive with the symptoms , it gives us a yellow flag ... it does n't mean immediately putting on the space suits			0
' first @entity18 victim : @entity167 , a @entity168 who flew to @entity78 , died of @entity2 this week missed the warnings : @entity171 failed to act when mr @entity167 first showed up exhibiting @entity2 symptoms that said , the company has also put together a guide for transporting patients who have tested positive for the virus			1
it includes step - by - step instructions on how to use plastic sheeting , garbage bags and duct tape to protect the ambulance and the driver from contaminants			0
step no. 2 : ' place sheeting on the floor of the rig and affix to bench seat , jump seat and walls to create a bowl affect in an effort to channel any body fluids toward the center of the floor causing fluids to collect in one area			0
' a more commonplace precaution has popped up at the @entity200 in @entity201 , @entity10 , a village of 4,400 people near the @entity205 state boarder			0
@entity206 , an infection prevention and control nurse , said the hospital posted signs at entrances about a month ago telling patients to notify the staff immediately if they 've traveled recently to @entity14 countries hit by the outbreak			1
other hospital protocols are under review , she said			0
' we will definitely revisit that to see if we need to do anything additional , ' she said			0
three major hospitals in @entity69 have established isolation units and consulted with staff members about how to handle the next @entity2 patient , if one arises			1
with eight children sent home from school because they had direct contact with the lone confirmed @entity2 victim , @entity232 in northwest @entity69 is preparing to treat any pediatric @entity2 patients			1
doctors at the other two facilities , @entity236 and @entity237 , have identified doctors and nurses ready to treat any @entity2 patient			1
as has become commonplace nationwide , the @entity69 hospitals are screening incoming patients to see if they 've traveled to @entity14 within the last three weeks			1
officials at the @entity244 , while urging providers to be prepared , also have repeatedly said that they do n't believe the country is likely to see the type of outbreak that has killed thousands of people in @entity168 , @entity250 and @entity251			0
mortality rates are likely to be much lower in the @entity18 , due to more sophisticated care , experts say			2
@entity2 also is n't nearly as contagious as illnesses such as the flu , which can be spread through the air , or @entity258 , which can be transmitted by people who have no symptoms			2
still , there is concern in some quarters that not enough is being done			0
@entity264 , a union that says it represents about 185,000 nurses nationwide , has been distributing a survey on @entity2 preparedness to its members			2
@entity270 spokesman @entity269 said many respondents have said they do n't feel nurses at their hospital have gotten enough training about how to handle a patient who might have the virus			0
many of the nurses said they were n't even aware of whether their hospital had protective gear , he said			0
' it 's not enough to post a link to the @entity244 on the hospital 's website , ' he added			0
@entity54 , the infectious disease specialist at @entity55 , said that to truly be prepared against the virus , officials may want to think beyond health care facilities			0
for instance , he suggested that cab drivers might be given pamphlets urging them to ask sick passengers on the way to the hospital the same question being posed now by ambulance drivers and triage nurses : have you traveled to @entity14 lately ? ' i would n't put it in terms that are going to make people panic , ' he said			1
but he said that , at the very least , drivers should know that cleaning up a mess left by a sick passenger could carry a health risk .			0

public hospitals in @entity1 have been employing the tactic to make ready
nobody has caught @entity2 in the @entity18 yet - but health services are on alert
comes after hospital in @entity69 turned away first @entity2 victim to enter @entity18
@entity167 presented with fever and @entity14 travel history
@entity321 raised alarm - but he went home and could have infected others
mr @entity167 died this week , amid scare cases across the country
