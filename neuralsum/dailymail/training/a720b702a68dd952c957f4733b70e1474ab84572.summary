a recent study has found that both males and females have their individual flaws when it comes to space travel			1
the study looked at reports for the 534 astronauts - 477 men and 57 women - that had been to space up until june 2013			1
and while women were less likely to suffer a loss of hearing or vision , it was found that men had an overall greater tolerance for spaceflight in a number of categories			1
a study by @entity24 and and the @entity25 ( @entity26 ) looked at the role of gender in spaceflight			1
they looked at records of more than 500 astronauts up to june 2013 and presented their findings in the @entity33			1
illustrated are some of the findings ( click for a larger view ) the report , published in the @entity33 , was carried out by @entity24 and the @entity25 ( @entity26 )			2
they assembled six workgroups to investigate and summarise human spaceflight data			0
they focused on cardiovascular , immunological , sensorimotor , musculoskeletal , reproductive and behavioral implications for men and women who had travelled to space			0
in the study , it was found that women were less likely to suffer a loss of quality of vision owing to space travel , and men were also more likely to suffer more hearing problems			1
however women were found to have a worse orthostatic intolerance - which is the inability to stand without fainting - upon returning to @entity60			2
@entity62 intolerance this is the inability to stand without fainting			0
it was found to be more prevalent in women after returning to @entity60			2
winner : men loss of blood plasma women lose a greater volume of blood plasma during spaceflight than men , while their heart rate also increases more during stressful situations			1
winner : men vision impairment men are more likely to have their vision impaired by spaceflight , according to the study			2
82 per cent of male astronauts versus 62 per cent of female astronauts were found to be affected by @entity86 ( @entity88 ) syndrome			1
winner : women immune system no noticeable difference between male and female immune responses was observed in space			0
on the ground , however , women have a more potent immune response than men , although they are more susceptible to autoimmune diseases			0
winner : tie radiation permissible radiation exposure levels are lower for female than male astronauts as it has been shown that women are more susceptible to radiation - induced cancer			1
winner : men motion sickness after arriving at the microgravity environment on the @entity114 , female astronauts were more likely to suffer from space motion sickness ( @entity116 ) compared with men			2
however , on returning to @entity60 men were more likely to suffer from motion - sickness symptoms			1
winner : tie loss of hearing as they grow older , men are much more likely to lose hearing sensitivity at several frequencies compared to women			0
winner : women @entity129 ( @entity130 ) utis were found to be more common in women in space , but can be successfully treated with antibiotics			0
winner : men behavioural problems there was found to be no difference in terms of behavioural or psychological responses to spaceflight in men and women , owing to the intense psychological training that all astronauts must undergo according to the researchers			2
winner : tie women also had a higher heart rate in stressful situations and were more susceptible to radiation - induced cancer , while @entity129 ( @entity130 ) were more common in female astronauts than males			1
there were no noticeable differences in behavioural responses to men and women in spaceflight , while other factors such as the effectiveness of immune systems in space required further data for a meaningful conclusion to be drawn			0
ultimately , at the moment men seem to have fewer problems than women in travelling to space - but the researchers stress more data is needed , especially for female astronauts			1
@entity86 ( @entity88 ) syndrome was identified in 2005 , and it is currently @entity24 's leading spaceflight - related health risk			2
it was found to be more predominant among men than women in space			0
here , @entity24 astronaut @entity181 uses a fundoscope to image her eye while in orbit the reason for the study is that the health and safety considerations for astronauts will grow more and more difficult as @entity24 and other agencies attempt longer - duration spaceflights			1
for example , the @entity114 partners will soon begin year - long stays for crews on the space station , as opposed to the six - month missions that currently take place			0
with that in mind , @entity24 is looking to develop personalised medicine for astronauts who could spend years working away from planet earth			2
one of the key considerations in creating this medicine will be the gender of the astronaut in question			0
@entity24 is taking strides to redress the imbalance of the number of men and women that have been to space			0
for example , the 2013 astronaut candidate class , shown here in front of an @entity220 crew capsule mockup , comprises four women and four men last month science writer @entity224 , who took part in a simulated mission to the red planet , argued that the first mission to the red planet should be crewed by only women			0
last year she took part in a @entity24 project called @entity233 ( @entity234 and @entity235 ) , which simulated a long - duration mission to @entity237 on @entity60			1
ms @entity224 and five other crewmembers - three men and three women in total - spent four months in a dome on @entity241 , only leaving the habitat in mock spacesuits			0
she says it was rare for a woman to burn more than 2,000 calories a day , whereas men regularly exceeded 3,000			0
her conclusion is that sending women to @entity237 would be cheaper and more feasible than one with men			0
on @entity60 , of course , gender plays a huge role in deciding what treatment to give to a particular person , and similarly @entity24 wants to know the implications of gender on spaceflight			1
‘ fortunately , we have the @entity114 , ’ said dr. @entity259 , director of space life and @entity261 at @entity24			0
‘ [ the ] station provides us with years of biological data on male and female astronauts , and many of them continue to participate in ground - based studies to evaluate the lasting effects of spaceflight			1
’ however , one issue with the study was that a vastly greater number of men have been to space than women - 477 compared to just 57			2
@entity24 is seeking to redress that balance , with their latest crew selection being four women and four men , but it remains hard to draw definitive conclusions from the data available			1
the findings of the report recommended that more women are selected for space missions			0
they also suggested encouraging more people to take part in ground and flight studies on @entity60 , while gender should also be incorporated into @entity24 - funded research programmes .			1

study by @entity24 in @entity294 looked at role of gender in spaceflight
they looked at records of more than 500 astronauts up to june 2013
overall , the report found men coped with spaceflight better
males had a lower heart rate during stressful situations , suffered fewer urinary tract *infections* , and coped with *landing* better
but , females were less likely to suffer vision or hearing impairments
the report stresses more data is needed to draw conclusions
in the study there were 477 male astronauts but only 57 female , too
it 's hoped the research could help @entity24 develop *techniques* for long - duration spaceflight mission beyond @entity60 in the *future*
