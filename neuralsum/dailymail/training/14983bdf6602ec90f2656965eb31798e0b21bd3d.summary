by @entity0 and @entity1 a new powdered alcohol product announced just days ago has had its approval promptly reversed following a barrage of negative publicity surrounding fears that it could encourage irresponsible - and even underage - drinking			1
the @entity8 approved @entity10 's powdered vodka , rum , and other cocktails ‘ in error , ’ @entity13 , the agency 's director of congressional and public affairs , told @entity17 via email			1
the agency did not responded to further questions			0
the company behind @entity10 , @entity23 , @entity25 - based @entity24 , said that ‘ there seemed to be a discrepancy [ about ] how much powder ’ is in the packets , which are meant to be mixed with water			1
prior to having its approval withdrawn on monday , @entity31 had previously announced six varieties of powdered alcohol including vodka and rum according to the website for the @entity8 , multiple varieties of @entity31 received ‘ label approval ’ on april 8			1
@entity31 had previously announced six varieties of powdered alcohol , including vodka , rum and four cocktails - @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
the company agreed to surrender its approvals on monday and has said that it will resubmit the product for approval by the @entity8			1
no sooner had @entity31 announced its initial products than critics where questioning the potential dangers of a powered form of alcohol which could fit into a pocket , making it more portable than a bottle or flask of liquor			1
no sooner had @entity31 announced its initial products than critics where questioning the potential dangers of a powered form of alcohol which could fit into a pocket , making it more portable than a bottle or flask of liquor the company agreed to surrender its approvals on monday but has said that it will resubmit @entity10 for approval vodka and eggs ? as well as adding the alcoholic power to water , the site also suggested that @entity10 could be poured over food the company initially did little to discourage these fears as the @entity31 website featured a lot of information on how the product could be used to consume alcohol in unusual ways and little about promoting ‘ responsible drinking ’			1
' maybe you ’re a college football fan			0
so many stadiums do n’t even serve alcohol			0
what ’s that about ; watching football without drinking ? ! that ’s almost criminal			0
bring @entity10 in and enjoy the game , ' stated the website			1
as well as adding the alcoholic power to water , the site also suggested that @entity10 could be poured over food			2
' @entity31 on almost any dish and give it an extra kick			2
some of our favorites are the @entity102 in guacamole , rum on a bbq sandwich , @entity44 on a salad and vodka on eggs in the morning to start your day off right			0
' there were even some rudimentary cooking instructions : ' remember , you have to add @entity112 a dish is cooked as the alcohol will burn off if you cook with it ... and that defeats the whole purpose			0
' the company also appeared to be encouraging users to try snorting their product : ' you ’ll get drunk almost instantly because the alcohol will be absorbed so quickly in your nose			2
' those posts were quickly taken down and the company claims it was simply experimenting with ' edgy marketing ' that was n't meant to be seen by the public			1
party on ! the company had stated that @entity10 would make it easier to consume alcohol where it is normally banned , such as at ball games @entity31 had previously announced several cocktail varieties including @entity47 and a @entity131 ‘ as @entity31 is a new product , we have yet to understand its potential of being added to food , ’ the website now states , along with warning people that the powder should n't be snorted			1
according to the site , the product ’s founder @entity138 came up with the idea because he is an ‘ active guy ’ and wanted a way to enjoy an adult beverage after long hours hiking , biking or camping without having to carry around heavy bottles			0
' what we can say now is that we hope the product will be used in a responsible and legal manner			0
being in compliance with all @entity153 and @entity154 laws is very important to us			0
@entity31 will only be sold through establishments that are licensed to sell liquor			2
' powdered alcohol is not a new concept			2
such products are already being sold in other countries including @entity161 , @entity162 , and the @entity163			0
according to some , alcohol laws would in general only apply to liquids			0
this would mean that powder - based alcoholic beverages could be sold to minors and that the powder would be exempt from alcohol tax and laws , as is the case with certain products in the @entity163 .			0

@entity10 has had its approval by the @entity8 reversed
the launch of the powdered alcohol was announced just days ago but immediately faced criticism that it encouraged irresponsible drinking
initially the @entity31 website stated that it could be easily *sneaked* into sporting events and *sprinkled* on food
the company has since removed the information and claimed it was experimenting with ' edgy marketing ' that was n't meant for the public
the *manufacturer* has said it will resubmit the product for approval again
