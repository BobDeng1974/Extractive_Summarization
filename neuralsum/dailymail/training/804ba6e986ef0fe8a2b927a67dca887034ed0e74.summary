by @entity0 last updated at 12:53 am on 2nd february 2012 more to follow suit ? tories do n't want former @entity4 chief @entity3 to be the last banker to be stripped of a knighthood tories demanded further action against failed bankers yesterday following the decision to strip @entity3 of his knighthood			1
mps called for more financiers , including colleagues of mr @entity3 at @entity4 , to lose the right to be called sir			1
but others condemned the action against mr @entity3 , with business leaders claiming it amounted to hysteria			1
mr @entity3 ’s friend , motor racing champion sir @entity22 , said he thought the former bank boss had been made a scapegoat while former chancellor @entity26 said the decision to take way his title was tawdry			1
@entity4 had to be bailed out with £ 45billion of taxpayers ’ money after mr @entity3 steered it to the biggest corporate disaster in @entity34 history			1
senior figures in @entity36 have also discussed attempting to strip him of his massive pension			1
mr @entity3 , whose knighthood was annulled on monday by order of the @entity40 , is still receiving what is effectively a tax - payer - funded pension of £ 342,500 a year for life from @entity4			1
some @entity7 want to tackle him about his pension in the expectation that he would challenge such a move using the @entity48			2
this would boost public opposition to the act which they want to replace with a @entity34 @entity53			0
there were also calls for peers who have committed crimes to lose their titles			2
however , business leaders protested at the removal of mr @entity3 ’s knighthood on the recommendation of a secretive @entity64 committee , claiming it was ‘ hysteria ’			1
and former chancellor mr @entity26 claimed the decision was ‘ tawdry ’			2
he added : ‘ there were other knights of the realm on the board – are we going after them ? ’ former conservative chancellor @entity73 backed the decision on mr @entity3			1
‘ you can say “ why pick him out ? ” but every schoolmaster knows sometimes it ’s necessary to make an example , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t think anybody can have the slightest sympathy for mr @entity3 , who through a mixture of vanity , greed and sheer incompetence presided over the biggest banking disaster in @entity34 history			1
’ @entity90 , deputy chairman of the @entity91 and a member of the treasury select committee , insisted : ‘ this has not been done on a whim … this is three and a half years after the downfall of @entity4 and follows a very detailed report from the @entity99 that details the exact role that @entity3 played			1
’ @entity91 @entity101 last night called for sir @entity102 and sir @entity103 to lose their knighthoods for their roles in the merger of @entity107 and @entity108 during the financial crisis			1
sir @entity102 was chairman of @entity111 when it merged with @entity108 in 2009			1
in the firing line : the @entity7 have called for former @entity111 chairman sir @entity102 ( left ) and former @entity108 chief executive sir @entity103 to lose their knighthoods for their roles in the merger of the two banks sir @entity0 was chief executive of @entity108 until 2006 before becoming deputy chairman of the @entity99			1
one @entity91 said : ‘ these guys were on the last helicopter out of @entity121			0
so we are going after them			0
‘ @entity102 agreed to take over @entity108 as a favour to @entity123			2
‘ there will be an @entity99 report on that next year			0
it wo n’t be the same plane crash of awfulness that was @entity4			2
but it will still be pretty bad			0
’ mr @entity90 hinted that further knighthoods could be stripped : ‘ there is going to a report now from the @entity99 into the @entity108 - @entity107 disintegration			2
so who knows what will follow from that ? ’ the affair also led to broader calls for reform of the honours system			0
exchequer exchange : former @entity143 chancellor @entity26 ( left ) branded the decision to remove mr @entity3 's ' tawdry ' , but former @entity91 chancellor @entity73 ( right ) said it was necessary to set an example labour leader @entity147 , who insisted his party had been wrong to nominate mr @entity3 for his honour for ‘ services to banking ’ in 2004 , told the @entity152 : ‘ i think there ’s got to be caution exercised about who gets honours now			1
‘ the circumstances in which people can have these honours revoked at the moment are pretty narrow – it ’s breaking the law and professional misconduct			0
‘ but if you damage the @entity34 economy or society , you should n’t be able to keep such a privilege			0
’ mr @entity147 said ordinary people , not civil servants , should decide whether to give or revoke honours			2
he added : ‘ you need a wider cross section than civil servants – people from civic life , church leaders , those representing consumers , people from business , actually , who would probably be near the front of the queue of saying it ’s not good to have somebody who brings business into disrepute			0
’ @entity36 indicated it may look at ways of stripping peers of their titles where they have been convicted of crimes , a view backed yesterday by @entity193 ’s first minister @entity192			2
shamed : high - profile figures who have lost their knighthoods since @entity197 peers including @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 have all been jailed but have been allowed to return to the @entity202			0
‘ why are they still in a legislature ? ’ said mr @entity192 , who was close to mr @entity3			1
he admitted he now regretted his strong support for the banker			0
former formula 1 motor racing world champion sir @entity22 – a close friend of mr @entity3 – said he thought the former bank boss had been made a scapegoat			1
‘ no single person or even any single bank created the biggest financial recession in modern times , ’ he said			0
‘ to have this ( knighthood ) stripped is poor for the constitution and very dangerous for the future			0
’ in the @entity218 , @entity217 and mr @entity147 traded blows as the @entity143 leader called for banks to be forced to disclose how many executives earn more than £ 1million			0
he said the government was ‘ part of the problem ’ on executive pay			0
bank bosses have been ordered to step up efforts to claw back bonuses paid to executives involved in the mis - selling of payment protection insurance to millions of customers			0
@entity234 was sold to those holding credit cards or taking out loans on the premise that they would be able to meet their payments if they became ill or lost their jobs			0
the @entity99 asked bosses including @entity243 of @entity4 , @entity244 of @entity245 , @entity246 of @entity247 and @entity248 of @entity107 to show how they have tried to reclaim payouts linked to one of the worst misselling scandals in financial services history .			2
