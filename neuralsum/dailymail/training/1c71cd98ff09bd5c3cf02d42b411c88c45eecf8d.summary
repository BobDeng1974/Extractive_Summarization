@entity2 swimmer , @entity0 had enough to worry about as he took on the freezing ocean in a grueling eight hour and 36 minute swim across the @entity5 on tuesday			1
but he had his mind taken off the extreme temperature when he noticed a two metre shark - shaped figure swimming beneath him in the @entity11 waters			1
luckily enough , the shark never attempted an attack as a pod of dolphins soon came to his side , swimming alongside mr @entity0 for an hour while he crossed the strait			1
whether they simply wanted to join in the fun or were actually actively participating in protecting mr @entity0 from a possible shark attack is unclear , but the swimmer is grateful non-the-less			0
' it would be a nice thought they were thinking , we will just help our pal get through , ' mr @entity0 told a @entity11 website			0
mr @entity0 was partaking in his sixth swim as part of the @entity41 challenge in which participants attempt to swim what are considered the seven hardest long - oceans around the world , while raising money for the @entity47			1
the athlete later added the following comment to his @entity51 page after completing the swim : ' yesterday i swam the 6th of the ' oceans seven ' swims ' @entity5 ' in 8 hours 36 mins			2
but that does n't tell the whole story rolling waves , big currents but more important than that a dream come true swimming with dolphins over an hour ! ! ' i 'd like to think they were protecting me and guiding me home ! ! ! this swim will stay with me forever , ' he wrote			2
mr @entity0 prepping for his sixth swim as part of the @entity69 challenge in @entity70 , @entity71 the @entity2 swimmer said he saw a two - metre beast swimming beneath him before the pod of 10 dolphins joined him despite being told not to worry about sharks by legendary @entity11 swimmer @entity77 , who mentored mr @entity0 before his swim and having crossed the strait eight times himself , mr @entity0 confirmed he ' had a go at him ' once he 'd finished his swim			1
but it 's not the first time that dolphins , who often attack sharks in order to protect themselves and their young , have beenreported to ' save ' humans from an impending shark attack			0
in 2004 , a group of four swimmers were protected from a three metre great white shark by a pod of dolphins which encircled the group just off of a @entity11 beach			1
@entity98 , a @entity2 - born lifeguard , who was saved by the dolphins after having gone for a swim with his daughter , @entity101 and her two friends , told the @entity103 that the dolphins upheld their position for a full 40 minutes			2
getting very close : mr @entity0 said the dolphin 's came close enough to brush his feet with their tails while he swam the @entity5 mr @entity0 faced freezing water , roilling waves and big currents on the sixteen nautical mile stretch , starting off from @entity71 and finishing at @entity113 ' they started to herd us up , they pushed all four of us together by doing tight circles around us , ' mr @entity98 said			2
' it [ the shark ] was only about two metres away from me , the water was crystal clear and it was as clear as the nose on my face , ' he said before adding about the dolphins : ' they had corralled us up to protect us			0
' however mr @entity0 faced more difficulties than just sharks during the sixteen nautical mile stretch along the @entity5 , which he started from @entity71 and finished off at @entity113			0
the swimmer was overcome with motion sickness in the choppy waters of which he said : ' it was like swimming in a washing machine			0
' mr @entity133 is ecstatic after his 6 hour swim in @entity135 : the @entity137 challenge involves participants swimming the @entity139 , the @entity5 , the @entity140 , the @entity141 , the @entity142 , the @entity143 and the @entity144 unable to vomit while swimming , he was forced to throw - up while treading water before having to swim against the hard currents to avoid the @entity148 islands and get to his finishing point			1
according to the @entity137 website , only one person has ever completed the entire @entity153 challenge which includes the participant swimming the @entity139 , the @entity5 , the @entity140 , the @entity141 , the @entity142 , the @entity143 and the @entity144			0
mr @entity0 hopes to be the first @entity2 man to complete the challenge and after successfully swimming the @entity5 , he is preparing for the most challenging and final swim - the @entity139 : a stretch of water between @entity159 and @entity160 , infamous for it 's freezing temperature and difficult nature			1
his experience in the @entity5 was not the first bad experience with native wildlife mr @entity0 has had , after being stung by a @entity155 in @entity166			0
' i lost feeling in my spine for about five minutes , and then i just had to push through it , ' he said of the ordeal .			0

he was soon joined by 10 dolphins who swam alongside him for an hour
