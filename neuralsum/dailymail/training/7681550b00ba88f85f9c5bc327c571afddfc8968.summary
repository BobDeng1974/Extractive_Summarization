a senior @entity2 official ordered an emergency review of the military 's use of an anti-malaria drug known to have severe psychiatric side effects - nine days after the @entity9 massacre in which a @entity11 solider allegedly shot dead 17 civilians including nine children , it has been alleged			1
the notorious drug @entity15 , also known as @entity15 , has been implicated in a number of suicides and homicides in the military spanning back more than ten years , with side effects including paranoia , hallucinations and psychotic behaviour			1
it is now being suggested that staff sgt @entity25 , who is accused of the shooting , may have taken the drug before the march 11 massacre			1
claim : it is now being suggested that sgt @entity25 was given the anti-malaria drug @entity30 before the @entity9 massacre which should not be administered to soldiers with prior brain injuries tragic loss : @entity35 gestures to the body of her grandchild , who was allegedly killed by @entity25 in @entity39 , @entity40 province south of @entity41 , on march 11			1
the @entity42 has since given $ 50,000 compensation for every victim the military has used the drug for years despite its known side effects and in 2009 , they almost banned it due to its dangers			1
but a subsequent order suggested its use should be restricted and not given to soldiers who have suffered a traumatic brain injury			1
@entity54 is used to treat malaria and was developed by @entity57 researchers towards the end of the @entity59			2
it gained support among the fighting forces because it works in areas where mosquitoes developed resistance to an earlier treatment , chloroquine , and requires just one tablet a week , not the daily dose needed with other medications			0
side effects include seizures , depression , hallucinations , violent behaviour , feeling that others want to harm you , thoughts of hurting or killing yourself and many others			1
almost four decades after inventing it , the @entity57 pushed it to the back of its medicine cabinet			2
the about - face followed years of complaints and concerns that mefloquine caused psychiatric and physical side effects			1
over the past four years , the @entity57 slashed by almost 75 per cent the amount of mefloquine it prescribes , even as it sent thousands more soldiers to malaria - prone @entity9			1
soldiers who had suffered from traumatic brain injuries were particularly advised against using it			1
' @entity15 is a zombie drug			1
it 's dangerous , and it should have been killed off years ago , ' said dr. @entity98 , an epidemiologist and @entity57 major who has published research that he said showed the drug can be potentially toxic to the brain			1
when @entity103 was in @entity104 in 2010 , he sustained a massive brain injury			1
no one has been able to confirm whether he had been given the drug or not , citing privacy rules			2
on march 11 , it is alleged that the father - of - two sneaked out of his base before dawn and crept into houses in two nearby villages , opening fire on sleeping families within			1
@entity103 allegedly used his 9mm pistol and m - 4 rifle , which was outfitted with a grenade launcher , to kill four men , four women , two boys and seven girls , then burning some of the bodies			1
the @entity125 obtained a task order issued by assistant secretary of defense for health affairs @entity127 on march 20 which called for a review to ensure the drug was being administered appropriately			1
the website claims he called for an immediate ' review of @entity15 prescribing practices ' to be completed by the following monday , six days later			2
the order said : ' some deployed service members may be prescribed @entity15 for malaria prophylaxis without appropriate documentation in their medical records and without proper screening for contraindications			1
' it also notes that this review must include troops at ' deployed locations '			0
spokeswoman for the @entity2 @entity147 issued a statement saying : ' the department wide review of @entity15 prescription practices has no connection to the staff sgt @entity25 investigation			1
' assistant secretary of health affairs @entity127 requested this review in january to ensure each service conducts proper screening , patient education , and medical documentation			0
' in response to the @entity125 's claims the email was sent on march 20 , she said it was an army issue			0
late last year , almost four decades after inventing a potent anti-malarial drug , the @entity57 pushed it to the back of its medicine cabinet			1
the dramatic about - face followed years of complaints and concerns that mefloquine caused psychiatric and physical side effects even as it was used around the globe as a front - line defense against the mosquito - borne disease that kills about 800,000 people a year			1
' @entity15 is a zombie drug			2
it 's dangerous , and it should have been killed off years ago , ' said dr @entity98 , an epidemiologist and @entity57 major who has published research that he said showed the drug can be potentially toxic to the brain			1
he called it ' probably the worst - suited drug for the military ' and noted that its side effects can closely mirror symptoms of stress disorders related to combat , making diagnosis of neurological problems difficult			1
over the past three years , the @entity57 slashed by almost 75 per cent the amount of mefloquine it prescribes , even as it sent thousands more soldiers to malaria - prone @entity9			1
order : assistant secretary of defense for health affairs @entity127 allegedly ordered a review of the anti-malaria drug on march 20 , though the @entity2 claim it was made in january accusations : men stand next to blood stains and charred remains , left , inside a home where witnesses say @entity9 were killed by staff sgt @entity25 , right , who may have taken a dangerous anti malaria drug the decrease in dose followed two orders from military and @entity2 leaders in 2009			1
one , from the @entity57 's surgeon general , ordered the branch to limit its use to specific circumstances			2
other branches , however , continue to favor mefloquine			0
it gained support among the fighting forces because it works in areas where mosquitoes developed resistance to an earlier treatment , chloroquine , and requires just one tablet a week , not the daily dose needed with other medications			0
in a case which has parallels with the massacre , in 2003 the army dropped the case against staff sgt @entity235 , who also faced the death penalty , after he was charged with cowardly conduct as a result of fear			0
it came after he saw the shredded body of a gunned - down @entity104 and had what he thought was a panic attack - vomiting and hallucinations			2
a psychologist diagnosed a normal combat stress reaction and told him to rest and then return to duty			0
defiant : the wife of @entity25 defended her husband in an interview with @entity253 saying she finds the accusations against him unbelievable and claiming he would never do such a thing standing by her man : in the first interview since her husband was charged with the march 11 shootings , she revealed she has spoken to her husband twice and that he seemed confused instead , @entity235 was shipped back to @entity259 and charged with the crime , which is punishable by death under the @entity262			1
the last such conviction in the @entity57 occurred during the @entity59			2
the charges were dropped after doctors later determined that @entity235 suffered from @entity15 toxicity , which affected his behaviour when he was deployed in @entity104			1
former @entity57 staff sgt. @entity235 had charges dropped against him due to the use of the drug and is now a post traumatic stress disorder advocate and spokesman he is now a post traumatic stress disorder advocate and spokesman			1
former army psychiatrist @entity275 highlighted the continued use of the drug in the military and its connections with psychotic episodes			2
in her @entity282 blog , she wrote : ' one obvious question to consider is whether he was on mefloquine , an anti-malarial medication			0
' this medication has been increasingly associated with neuro - psychiatric side effects , including depression , psychosis , and suicidal ideation			1
' the @entity11 military has been avoiding the use of @entity15 for some years			2
yet it is still prescribed in some cases , since it is effective and needs only once a week dosing			0
it is still used in @entity9			0
' @entity103 ' wife @entity297 spoke out for the first time about the accusations against her husband and said she found them ' unbelievable ' and claimed they were not the actions of her husband			2
she also told @entity305 's @entity253 that @entity103 showed no signs of ptsd and was n't having any difficulties sleeping			0
questions to @entity103 ' lawyer @entity310 were not immediately returned			0
but he has previously claimed his client has apparent mental health issues and is suffering with memory loss , among other things			0

' i began to suffer short term memory loss , not able to recall what i had done earlier , ' he said			0
' i also had more bouts of anxiety , and i can not for the life of me tell you why			0
' in february 2009 , army surgeon general @entity333 sent a policy memo to doctors saying it should be used only if soldiers could not tolerate doxycycline , a general antibiotic effective at preventing malaria			0
in september 2009 , @entity338 , who at the time was deputy assistant secretary of defense overseeing health affairs , sent a letter similar to @entity342 's			0
this time , it was directed across all military branches			0
a small but vocal group of anti-mefloquine campaigners seized on the memos as vindication			0
' i was stunned , ' said retired @entity321 commander @entity350 , who said he sustained permanent damage to his sense of balance after taking @entity15 in @entity354 in 2002 and has been a persistent critic of the drug			2
in 2008 , the @entity57 dispensed 8,574 courses of the drug			2
in 2010 , it fell to 2,054			0
at the same time , the @entity57 increased fivefold the number of doxycycline prescriptions — to more than 80,000 — reflecting the increasing number of soldiers deployed to @entity9			2
spending followed a similar pattern , with the @entity2 buying almost $ 1.8 million of mefloquine in 2009 , enough for about 10,000 yearlong courses			0
