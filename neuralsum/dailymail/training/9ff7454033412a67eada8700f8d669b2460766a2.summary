by @entity0 published : 18:27 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 02:29 est , 7 june 2013 smiling : the @entity2 presents the @entity3 with the order of @entity6 award at @entity7 in central @entity8 yesterday most people heading for hospital – be they 19 or 91 – would probably prefer not to have tea with 8,000 people en route			1
but yesterday afternoon , the @entity3 was at the @entity2 ’s side as they plunged into a traditional @entity7 garden party with a cross-section of @entity18 life , from actor @entity19 to a group of @entity21			1
in perfect sunshine , to the clink of teacups and the gentle airs of the @entity26 , it was very much business as usual			0
certainly none of the guests – myself included – had the faintest idea the @entity3 might be en route to the @entity34 for up to a fortnight			1
garden parties follow a time - honoured format and yesterday ’s was no different			1
on the stroke of 4pm , the @entity2 and the @entity3 appeared through the doors on to the @entity40 with the @entity41 and @entity42			1
the tea tent emptied , the crowds ground to a standstill and all 8,000 of us stood to attention for the national anthem			0
then the royal team divided into different ‘ lanes ’ through the crowds , each one staked out by the @entity53 in full @entity55 rig			0
for a full sun - baked hour , the @entity2 , the duke and the @entity57 made snail - like progress through the throng – five deep in places and all eager for a handshake and a chat			1
it is a well - oiled machine			2
the @entity65 , retired gents from the forces , pluck out a varied selection of guests and senior royal officials do the introductions			2
see video below arrival : on the stroke of 4pm , the @entity2 and the @entity3 appeared through the doors on to the @entity40 yesterday , as usual , the duke was accompanied by his private secretary , brigadier @entity78 - @entity76 , as he chatted to dozens of guests , among them a little group from the @entity81 and a couple of alumni from his old @entity85 school , @entity86			1
it ’s always a broad church in the @entity3 ’s lane			2
yesterday ’s assembly included the @entity91 , the @entity92 , the @entity93 and the @entity94 of @entity95			0
also presented were a small contingent from @entity97 , which looks after every lighthouse in @entity99 and @entity100			0
an assiduous past patron , the @entity3 was at one of their dinners just two nights earlier			2
as chatty and boisterous as ever , the @entity3 worked his way down the entire lane but even then there was no respite			2
while many of us had long since sought a chair , a bit of shade , a plate of cucumber sandwiches ( sans crust ) , a raspberry tartlet and a bit of @entity120 cake – plus a cup of tea or a glass of the @entity7 ’s famous iced coffee – the @entity2 and the @entity3 were then ushered into the @entity125			1
gathering : for a full sun - baked hour , the @entity2 , the duke and the @entity57 made snail - like progress through the throng - five deep in places and all eager for a handshake and a chat here , they remained on their feet for another 40 minutes , working their way through a vip crowd			1
among those invited yesterday were the new archbishop of @entity138 and his wife plus cabinet ministers @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 ( with ‘ @entity144 ’ on the list , let ’s hope they ’d ordered in extra chocolate eclairs and scones )			0
as chatty and boisterous as ever , the @entity3 worked his way down the entire lane but even then there was no respite next door , in the @entity151 , a cross-section of @entity153 and ambassadors swapped gossip and looked on while the @entity157 moved on to @entity158 and @entity159			2
finally , at 5.45 , the duke escorted the queen back through the gardens			0
as always , they paused to chat to the guests in wheelchairs who are always offered pride of place alongside the homeward path by the @entity7 swimming pool			1
and then the crowds slowly enjoyed one last meander round the gardens in the evening breeze			0
it might be a charming @entity176 idyll for the 8,000 guests but it is always hard work for the hosts			0
and the largest garden party of the season is yet to come next month – for up to 10,000 at @entity183			1
let ’s hope the duke is back on his feet in time for that			0
by then he will be 92			0
would it be impertinent to offer him a chair ?			0

@entity3 was with @entity2 at @entity7 garden party
no guests - myself included - knew the @entity3 was en route to hospital
@entity3 will be in hospital for two weeks after suffering abdominal pain
