sir @entity0 , @entity2 's personal scientific adviser , has said that the rise of genetically modified food is ' inexorable ' calls to relax the rules on @entity8 crops were backed yesterday by the nation ’s chief scientist			1
sir @entity0 said the rise of genetically modified food was ‘ inexorable ’ and there was a ‘ strong case ’ for it to be grown in @entity13			1
so far biotech firms have been deterred from growing @entity8 crops in @entity15 by the tightest controls in the world			1
but controversially sir @entity0 , who is @entity2 ’s personal scientific adviser , said the food was proving its worth and production is increasing globally			1
‘ it is inexorably rising up the agenda again because as a technology it is showing its value more and more , obviously in terms of the crops that are able to feed the world , ’ he added			0
‘ the job of a scientific adviser is to set out the scientific case and that scientific case is becoming stronger and stronger			0
’ but @entity32 , of campaign group @entity33 , said : ‘ the public remains extremely sceptical about the safety of @entity8 foods and the benefits that are said to come from them			1
politicians and scientific leaders need to look at other food options that do not come with such a large risk			0
‘ the push for @entity8 is being orchestrated by large industry rather than in the interest of the consumer or public health			2
’ sir @entity0 said it was his ‘ job to advise on the science and it is then the politician ’s job to decide how to use that ... the final decision is a political decision ’			1
his comments – in his first public speech in the job – are the latest indication that the @entity8 lobby is rapidly gaining influence after years of public hostility			2
sir @entity0 , in his first public speech in the role as @entity2 's ( right ) scientific adviser , said there was a ‘ strong scientific case ’ for @entity8 crops to be grown in @entity13 and that @entity8 food is proving its worth globally doubts : campaigners say that the public is still not convinced that @entity8 foods are safe to eat earlier this month , four major supermarkets ended bans on farm suppliers giving @entity8 feed to animals producing meat , milk and eggs			1
the vast majority of those foods sold in @entity13 will now come from animals raised on a @entity83 , a survey by the @entity84 last year found two in three people believe food from animals given a @entity8 diet should be described as such			2
and a @entity90 study showed public support for so - called @entity92 declining from 46 per cent in 2002 to just 27 per cent now			0
campaign groups have also raised concerns over ministers ’ secret meetings with @entity8 lobby groups – details of which emerged only following freedom of information requests			2
supporter : environment secretary @entity102 said last year that he is a keen proponent of @entity8 foods environment secretary @entity104 last year came out as keen proponent of @entity8 crops , dismissing consumer fears as ‘ humbug ’			1
and , days ago , scientists called on ministers to back technology which could produce genetically modified salmon , pigs and cattle			0
speaking after his address to the @entity118 ’s centre for science and policy ’s annual conference , sir @entity0 said @entity8 crops could provide important potential benefits for food production			1
he added : ‘ for every genetic modification you have to ask what plant , what gene and for what purpose			0
the case will be strong for some and not strong for others			0
each case has be decided on its merits			0
’ asked for examples of crops that would benefit @entity13 farming , sir @entity0 said : ‘ if it were possible for instance to develop a blight - resistant potato , then that would be a valuable thing to do			1
’ he also said that ‘ golden rice ’ – genetically modified rice that contains higher levels of vitamin a to reduce blindness and other diseases in the developing world – had ‘ been around for some time ’			0
biotech firms such as @entity149 have ensured that 80 per cent of the soya grown in the @entity151 and @entity152 is @entity8 it is one of the reasons why @entity13 supermarkets have now been forced to allow @entity8 - fed produce into the food chain			1
new rules : earlier this month , four major supermarkets ended bans on farm suppliers giving @entity8 feed to chickens the first @entity8 meat and fish could also go on sale this summer			2
authorities in the @entity151 are expected to grant approval to @entity171 salmon , which has been modified to grow twice as fast as normal			0
for shoppers who refuse to buy meat , milk and eggs from animals fed on @entity8 , the only alternative may be to buy more expensive organic produce			2
@entity8 crop farming has been shown to harm bees , butterflies and other insects in @entity13 trials and on farms across the @entity151 , where many have become blighted with superweeds			0
sir @entity0 , 60 , was director of the @entity187 from 2003 to 2013 and has headed the @entity188 at @entity189			1
in 2009 , he was knighted for services to medical research .			0

sir @entity0 says the rise of @entity8 foods is ' inexorable '
biotech firms have been deterred by tight @entity15 controls
but sir @entity0 says the food is proving its worth globally
campaigners say the public remains sceptical about its safety
