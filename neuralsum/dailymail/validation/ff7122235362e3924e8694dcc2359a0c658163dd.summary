a supermarket price war has saved shoppers across the high street £ 400milllion in the last 12 weeks			1
prices are down by an average of 1.6per cent on a year ago , fuelling evidence that the government ’s official measures of inflation will show a period of ‘ good deflation ’			1

@entity31 ’s biggest supermarket , along with @entity32 , @entity33 ’s and @entity34 , have been forced to slash prices to combat the rise of budget chains , @entity38 and @entity39			1
essentials such as milk , bread , eggs , vegetables and roasting chickens have seen big price cuts since the turn of the year , delivering a real reduction in the cost of putting food on the table			1
the @entity53 figures show @entity38 continues to thrive with sales up 19.3per cent on a year ago , giving in a market share of 5per cent , which means it is almost on a par with @entity59			1
sales at @entity39 are up by 13.6per cent in a year , giving it a market share of 3.5per cent			2
both @entity38 and @entity39 are thriving by deliberately target middle and higher income shoppers by peppering their aisles with high profile luxury or award winning food and drink			2
just last week , @entity38 launched packs of two gourmet beef @entity71 burgers at £ 2.99 , which compares to £ 29 for the price of a similar burger at fashionable restaurants such as the @entity77 ’s @entity76			2
@entity13 ’s @entity78 , the head of retail and consumer insight , said : ‘ a combination of lower general inflation and the grocery price war has saved shoppers £ 400 million in the past 12 weeks , with deflation driven to a record low of -1.6per cent			1
supermarkets have been cutting the cost of bread , milk , eggs and other staples to compete with rivals supermarkets have been competing with @entity38 ( pictured ) and @entity39 , which increased its sales by targeting middle class shoppers ‘ all of the major supermarkets are cutting prices to win shoppers , especially within everyday staples such as eggs , vegetables and milk			1
retailers are focusing their efforts on simple price cuts rather than complicated ‘ multi-buy ’ deals			0
’ he added : ‘ among the big four supermarkets @entity15 has been the standout retailer			0
it has posted its strongest performance in 18 months with sales up 1.1per cent compared with a difficult 2014			0
’ despite this , the firm ’s grocery market share continued to fall , going down by 0.1per cent to 28.7per cent			0
@entity13 said @entity15 ’s return to sales growth came largely at the expense of @entity32 , where sales over the 12 weeks were down by 2.1per cent - £ 95m – compared to the same period last year			0
sales at @entity33 ’s were down by 0.5per cent , while the figure at @entity34 was 0.4per cent lower			0
by contrast , @entity59 continues to do well with sales up 4.9per cent on a year ago , giving it a market share of 5.2per cent			2
however , much of this sales growth has been built on the back of deep price cuts to match the figures charges by the supermarkets , which is hitting its profit margins			2
for example , @entity59 ran a promotion where it cut the price of its small ‘ essentials ’ whole chicken from £ 4.23 to £ 2.11 – a saving of 50per cent – making it even cheaper than @entity38 and @entity39			1
