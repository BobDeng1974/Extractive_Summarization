a @entity1 chicken farmer who battled local council bureaucracy for five years says he hopes the multimillion dollar film being made about his life will inspire others ' to take no nonsense '			1
@entity7 , better known as @entity8 in his local community , helped the decimated @entity10 of @entity11 , off the coast of @entity13 in south - west @entity1 , survive after his faithful maremma dog @entity15 began protecting them in 2006			1
his unusual idea - to use the @entity19 sheepdogs to protect the local penguins from red foxes - has now been acclaimed by conservationists and the ' wildlife worriers ' he once fought so hard against			1
' the weird thing about the movie is that it might inspire someone out there to say " i 've got a good idea and i ’m not going to back down " , ' he told @entity30			2
he had the idea of using the dogs to protect the threatened @entity10 after a newspaper article exposed how they were being killed in their hundreds			1
in 2004 , 234 were killed by red foxes			1
in 2004 - 2005 only four penguins were left on the island , @entity47 reported			1
@entity50 said to @entity51 : ' i reckon these dogs would do the job			2
' coincidentally @entity51 ’s father @entity55 was a wildlife officer with the @entity56 and supported @entity8 ’s idea … but then came the first hurdle			2
@entity59 told them dogs were not allowed on @entity11			1
the chicken farmer first realised the protective nature of the white maremma dogs when @entity35 , a university science student working on his farm , recommended he get one to protect his chooks from red foxes the successful idea then inspired @entity8 to suggest using the dogs to protect the threatened @entity10 after it was reported they were being killed in their hundreds and their numbers were dwindling @entity50 explained how they had to wait until someone new started working at the council before they could take their battle against the people he calls ‘ wildlife worriers ’ any further			1
that person turned out to be @entity83 and his boss @entity84			2
‘ we nicknamed @entity84 the toe cutter as he had everyone jumping when he said something , ’ @entity50 laughed			2
in the forthcoming film , starring actor @entity90 as the chook farmer , @entity50 said a male dog called @entity93 will play @entity15			1
the dog is the real life @entity15 ’s grandson			1
oddball is a retired 14 - year - old bitch who swampy bred on his farm			1
‘ she was the first one to go out on the island to protect the penguins , ’ he explained			1
‘ she was the one to go because all the authorities were terrified the dogs were going to bite someone and they just wanted a nice easy going one out there , ’ he said			2
@entity11 in @entity13 , @entity1 , is cut off from land when the swell is up but during some months of the year red foxes can access it oddball originally went to the island for three weeks but she got ‘ lonely and swam home ’			1
then her aunt @entity116 was sent out there but she also swam home			2
‘ they are n’t used to being by themselves , they are used to being with a pack , ’ @entity50 explained			0
he finally managed to get the authorities to see that they needed two dogs out there for it to work so they did n’t get lonely			0
‘ when it finally started to happen it was after five - years that we 'd been working on it … but the principal is ridiculously simple , ’ @entity50 said			2
‘ the wildlife worriers do n’t understand dogs			0
they do n’t have real ones themselves , they might have little yappy things			0
‘ they do n’t understand how their territory works			0
that ’s why dogs attack the postman			0
@entity139 have an exceptionally strong sense of territory , ’ he reasoned			0
at first , @entity59 said dogs were not allowed on @entity11			1
however the idea was eventually approved by @entity83 when he joined the council team the @entity145 breed on the land and live in burrows dug out in the sand , soil or man - made structures			1
the maremmas are light - footed and do not disturb their nests @entity50 said the maremmas are n’t particularly fussed about the penguins , instead they are guarding the territory on the island			1
‘ they are cohabiting , they do n’t bond with them they put up with them , ’ he laughed			0
‘ when a fox tries to invade their territory then they ’ve got an argument on their hands			0
that argument initially starts of as a lot of barking and they bite			0
they have a good set of teeth			0
' despite now being retired , @entity50 said ‘ @entity175 killed a fox 12 months ago … she ’s still capable of taking on a fox			2
’ @entity8 had no idea a film would be made about his life but explained @entity90 ’s flick is just the latest media attention he ’s received over the years			1
when @entity15 first started saving the penguins it was around the time of the release of the 2006 @entity189 - @entity188 film @entity190			1
@entity59 and @entity47 run the @entity191 which has helped the penguin population survive after being threatened by foxes once every two weeks during the breeding season , a group of volunteers look for the penguins on @entity11 to count them ‘ the media all round the world just went berserk			1
we had the @entity202 and @entity203 and @entity204 and every tv channel in the country , ’ he explained			0
@entity90 ’s film , which recently wrapped filming , is not a documentary			1
' they ’ve used their artistic license , ' @entity50 said			0
in one scene a fox will be shown coming into the bathroom where a rescued penguin is living			0
@entity50 laughed : ‘ in real life you are not allowed to pick up penguins and take them home			2
’ the movie is set until the dogs started working on @entity11 but @entity50 said the ‘ funny stuff has happened since then ’ and thus he ’s eager for a sequel to be made			1
one of his many anecdotes from his adventures with @entity15 revolves around the time a penguin pecked her on the nose			0
‘ she still has a pink spot , ’ he laughed			0
‘ i ’m sitting there with this aboriginal elder guy called @entity232 and we could not concentrate it was so funny , ’ he said			0
dog handler @entity235 with @entity11 's current guards @entity237 and @entity238 : @entity50 explained that the dogs guard the territory , ' they are cohabiting [ with the penguins ]			1
they do n't bond with them , they put up with them ' @entity237 and @entity246 live on the @entity11 for a week at a time and are the 6th and 7th dogs to take part in the project to save the penguins by the end of this year , @entity8 could be leaving his huge @entity1 chook farm behind to jet around @entity188 and @entity256 for the film ’s red carpet promotional trail			1
‘ they said “ make sure your passport is up to date ” and i said “ make sure your cheque book is up to date ” , ’ he laughed			0
meanwhile , @entity15 is living the ‘ life of leisure ’			0
she spends her afternoons on the veranda under the sun. ‘ she has worked hard for 13 years that ’s the equivalent of 90 years human work , she has done well , ’ he said			0
@entity8 had to put her brother down 12 months ago because he had stomach cancer and said ‘ the two had been inseparable ’			0
‘ that ’s part of the reason she swam off the island before because she ’d never been alone , ’ he said			0
the farmer can not talk highly enough of his maremmas , including @entity15 who once comforted him after he fell off the back of his truck and badly winded himself			0
‘ the next thing i knew oddball was cuddled up to me looking after me , ’ he recalled			0
the passionate dog lover said ‘ we need to give animals a great deal more respect for their abilities than we do			2
’ ‘ we think we are the @entity294 , in fact we are the meanest predator , ’ he said			0
@entity235 looks after the maremmas now that @entity15 has retired oddball may now be retired but @entity8 still patrols the beach off the coast of @entity13 two or three times a week with his dog @entity304 , who leaves his scent to ward off the foxes			1
as for the penguins , they are thriving and are back up to a population of around 100			2
@entity11 is currently cut off from unwanted visitors because of a high - swell but two maremmas – @entity237 and @entity313 - live on the @entity11 for a week at a time			1
they are the 6th and 7th dogs , looked after by dog handler @entity235 , to be used for the project and the island has remained fox free since the maremmas were introduced in 2006			2
and just as @entity15 's legend lives on in the local community , so does @entity8 ’s			1
‘ i guess he ’s one of the creative existential thinkers that we all have in our cities			0
‘ he ’s obviously someone one that thinks outside the square , ’ @entity83 , @entity13 council ’s driver of the @entity191 said			2
‘ we just pulled together all the parts of the puzzle which turned @entity8 ’s ideas into reality			0

@entity7 *persuaded* his local council to allow his dog to guard penguins
@entity10 of @entity11 , south - west @entity1 , were almost extinct
@entity7 's @entity342 protected them from being killed by foxes
actor @entity90 will star as @entity7 in the film *due* out in 2015
