co-op bank is seeking to recover contractual payments made to mr @entity2 , and he has been told to hand back Â£ 31,000			2
' when @entity2 relinquished his responsibilities in june , it was agreed , as per his contractual obligations , that his fees for the rest of his period of office would be paid , ' the bank said in a statement			1
' following recent revelations , the board stopped all payments with immediate effect and no further payments will be made			0
' mr @entity2 , a @entity14 minister , was suspended by both the church and the @entity16 following allegations that he bought and used illegal drugs an ' internal fact - finding review ' - looking at emails and other evidence - is being carried out by the bank			1
the assistant secretary of the @entity59 , the @entity60 , acknowledged the risk that allegations against mr @entity2 would ' tarnish ' the church 's reputation			2
mr @entity60 told the @entity65 : ' i think inevitably some of the speculation has raised questions , as it always does for the church , about the trustworthiness of ministers			1
' inevitably , it 's regrettable when the allegations made against one minister then tarnishes the extremely good and honourable work undertaken by all of our ministers			2
' certainly the actions that are now under public scrutiny inevitably raise a question about the role of the church			2
' it was reported today that mr @entity2 was the subject of an inquiry into ' lavish ' expenses claims at the co-op when he resigned from the mutual 's group board in june			1
@entity92 being questioned by the @entity93 earlier this month about his time as chairman at the co-op bank the @entity65 said he stepped down after being confronted with a dossier of his claims , compiled by the then - chairman @entity99			1

' i do n't think we were incurious , ' said mr @entity60			0
' the necessary processes that dealt with the two convictions had reassured themselves that here was a person who could continue with our ministry like any other @entity14 minister under the normal discipline of our ministry			2
' i do n't think it was being incurious			0
there is a fine balance to strike between curiosity on the basis of evidence presented and curiosity based on speculation and gossip			0
' corridors of power : @entity2 attends a @entity135 reception in 2010 under the last government mr @entity60 said that the church was given ' no formal indication ' by @entity14 ministers of concerns about inappropriate behaviour by mr @entity2			0
he added : ' people make observations about those who are in the public eye , but we are not able to act on comments about a person 's behaviour without any firm evidence			0
' clearly , it would have been immensely helpful to us if bodies had been rather clearer about some of the concerns in the past			0
hitherto , we have dealt appropriately with what we have known about in a formal context			0
' a @entity158 member of @entity159 , @entity160 , said he and other councillors were told that mr @entity2 was leaving the authority due to work pressures , and not as a result of pornography being found on his computer			1
mr @entity160 told the programme : ' we were told he had resigned through pressure of other work commitments - ie , the @entity101			2
' he was a very believable , very plausible chap , always immaculately dressed			0
he speaks with confidence and even with an air of superiority			0
on the surface , a hail - fellow - well - met and seemingly well - connected			0
' to be frank , i 'm not surprised that he has worked his way up the greasy pole because he is very , very plausible			0
' what does concern me is the seeming lack of any checks or any vetting procedure to stop him getting to the dizzy height that he got to			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
