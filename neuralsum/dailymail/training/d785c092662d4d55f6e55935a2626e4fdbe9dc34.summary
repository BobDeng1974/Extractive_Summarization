the infrasonic shockwave caused by the explosion of the meteor which slammed into central @entity3 nearly a fortnight ago was the loudest sound ever recorded by the global nuclear testing watchdog			1
seventeen listening stations operated across the world by the @entity8 ( @entity9 ) detected the sound wave as it traversed the planet			1
the furthest station to record the sub-audible sound was more than 9,000 miles away in @entity14			1
loudest ever infrasonic shockwave : this imge from a @entity3 driver 's dashboard camera shows the explosion caused as a meteorite burned up in the atmosphere over central @entity3 a fortnight ago almost 1,200 people were injured when the untracked lump of space rock exploded over the @entity25 at 03.22 gmt on february 15 , with the debris narrowly missing a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city of @entity29 estimated by @entity31 to have been 55ft - wide and with a weight of some 10,000 tons , the meteor is thought to have exploded above the @entity25 mountains with a force equivalent to about 500kilotons			1
that makes its impact nearly 25 times more powerful than the atom bomb dropped on @entity39 in 1945			2
the low frequency waves emitted by the gargantuan blast were not audible to the human ear , but were recorded by the @entity9 's network of sensors as they travelled across continents			1
global tracking system : this @entity48 image has lines drawn to the 17 infrasound stations in the @entity9 's network that detected the infrasonic waves from the meteor as it broke up over @entity3 's @entity25 mountains ' we saw straight away that the event would be huge , in the same order as the @entity60 event from 2009 , ' said @entity61 , an acoustic scientist with the agency			1
' the observations are some of the largest that @entity9 's infrasound stations have detected			2
' until last week , the meteor explosion above @entity60 , @entity66 , in october 2009 was the largest infrasound event registered by 15 stations in the @entity9 's network			1
@entity69 has been used as part of the @entity9 's tools to detect atomic blasts since april 2001 when the first station came online in @entity74			1
data from the stations is sent in near real time to @entity78 , @entity79 , for analysis at the @entity9 's headquarters			0
both the raw and analysed data are provided to all @entity84			0
' we saw straight away that the event would be huge ' : a visual representation of the infrasonic shockwaves generated by the fireball , as recorded by the infrasound listening station in @entity91 questions are being asked as to why @entity3 's powerful missile defence radar systems did not detect the meteorite that exploded over the country this month			1
in the aftermath of the impact @entity3 politicians called on the world 's powerful nations to urgently develop technology to spot asteroids and meteorites that threaten our planet			0
but with @entity3 having one of the most high tech early warning systems of any nation on @entity109 , many are wondering why the nuclear superpower was not able to detect the incoming object itself			1
experts from the @entity115 have claimed that despite the size of the meteor , early warning radars ' never had a chance ' - since they were never designed to detect rocks hurtling in from outer space			1
the group published an image , above , showing how far into space the country 's radar systems can penetrate			0
a project researcher writes : ' as can be seen from the picture , the meteorite was out of the field of view of the @entity134 radar and it was below the horizon as seen from @entity136 , so the @entity133 could not see it either			0
' the @entity138 radar in @entity139 might have detected the meteorite if it looked up , but it did n't - as an early - warning radar its mission is to search the narrow strip of space just above the horizon , which a ballistic missile would cross if it ever comes			0
' they do n't ( and should n't ) much care about anything else			0
' ' we know it 's not a fixed explosion because we can see the change in direction as the meteorite moves towards the earth , ' said mr @entity61			2
' it 's not a single explosion , it 's burning , travelling faster than the speed of sound			2
that 's how we distinguish it from mining blasts or volcanic eruptions			0
' scientists all around the world will be using the @entity9 's data in the next months and year to come , to better understand this phenomena and to learn more about the altitude , energy released and how the meteor broke up			0
' there are currently 45 infrasound stations in the @entity9 's network that measure micropressure changes in the atmosphere generated by infrasonic waves			2
like meteor blasts , atomic explosions produce their own distinctive , low frequency sound waves that can travel across continents			1
@entity69 is one of four technologies ( including seismic , hydroacoustic and radionuclide ) the @entity9 uses to monitor the globe for violations of the @entity188 that bans all nuclear explosions			0
seismic signals from the meteor were also detected at several @entity91 stations close to the explosion and impact area			2
days before the meteor , on february 12 , 2013 , the @entity9 's seismic network detected an unusual seismic event in the @entity198 ( @entity198 ) , which measured 4.9 in magnitude			2
later that morning , the @entity198 announced that it had conducted a nuclear test			0
the event was registered by 94 seismic stations and two infrasound stations in the @entity9 's network			0
the data processing and analysis are designed to weed out natural events and focus on those events that might be explosions , including nuclear explosions .			0

furthest listening post to detect blast was 9,000 miles away in @entity14
explosion above city of @entity29 on february 15 hurt more than 1,200
low frequency infrasonic shockwave was not audible to the human ear
