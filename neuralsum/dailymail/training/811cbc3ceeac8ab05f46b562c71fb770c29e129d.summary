by @entity0 published : 18:26 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 19:27 est , 24 july 2013 @entity1 has unveiled a new streaming video gadget which will give users easier access to internet content on their televisions - taking aim straight at @entity9 's attempt to move into the living room			1
the new device , called @entity12 , is a small stick roughly the same size as a usb flash - storage drive that can be plugged directly into an @entity17 port on flat - panel tvs			1
it syncs with users ' smartphones , tablets and personal computers to bring @entity24 , @entity25 and other @entity27 content to what is usually the biggest screen in households			1
@entity1 's plan to take over the living room : a demonstration showing @entity1 's new @entity12 device syncing between a television and a laptop running @entity37 to show a video from the @entity40 website launch party : @entity42 , @entity1 's vice-president of product management , holds the new @entity44 as it is announced during a @entity1 event at @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 @entity1 wants to have a presence on tvs because it could open up a lucrative new channel for it to sell more ads , which bring in most of its revenue			1
in a show of its determination to make inroads on @entity50 , @entity1 yesterday began selling @entity12 for just $ 35 ( £ 22.85 )			1
that price undercuts the most popular internet - streaming devices made by @entity9 and @entity60			0
an @entity62 box sells for $ 99 ( £ 65 ) , while the least expensive @entity60 box capable of showing high - definition video goes for $ 80 ( £ 50 )			0
@entity60 , a company that formed within internet video subscription service @entity24 , also sells an internet streaming stick similar to @entity12 for $ 100 ( £ 65 )			2
simplicity : in a move that has allowed @entity1 to keep costs down , the hard work of processing video is done on a synced device , with @entity12 providing an easy interface to display the content on the big screen @entity12 , which leans heavily in @entity1 's widely used @entity37 , is just the latest product from the company intended to make inroads into the living room			1
previous offerings have n't worked out well			0
the company initially tried to embed an operating system called @entity82 into sets made by tv manufacturers , but that flopped			0
last year , @entity1 introduced an orb - like device called the @entity87 in hopes of delivering more internet video to flat - panel tvs , only to quickly pull the product from the market			2
with the @entity12 , in a move that has allowed @entity1 to keep costs down , the hard work of processing video is done on the synced device , with the stick merely providing an easy interface to display the content on the big screen			1
the @entity9 and @entity60 streaming boxes , by contrast , are standalone gadgets connected directly to the internet which rely on a standard remote control to select content			0
chromecast shown controlled by a @entity108 tablet : by offloading the hard work to a separate device , @entity1 has been able to keep costs down to a very competitive $ 35 ( £ 22 ) , including three months of @entity24 more expensive : the @entity12 is competitively priced against the @entity60 box , left , which starts at around £ 50 , and the @entity62 device , right , which usually also sells for around £ 50 ( @entity115 prices ) @entity117 analyst @entity116 said @entity12 could undermine @entity9 in the still - nascent market to plug streaming devices into @entity50 , just as the @entity108 tablets have siphoned some sales away from @entity9 's @entity122			1
' @entity12 looks like a smart and disruptive device , ' said ms @entity116			2
' maybe it took the other failures for @entity1 to get it right			2
' it faces stiff competition , but its comparatively reasonable price could see it come to dominate a rapidly growing market			0
earlier this year , @entity9 revealed that it has sold more than 13million of its streaming boxes			0
@entity60 said its sales of streaming boxes passed 5million units this year			0
as an enticement to get people to try @entity12 , @entity1 is offering three months of free @entity24 service with a purchase of the internet - streaming stick			2
that translates to a $ 24 value , leaving the cost of the device at $ 11 for those who would have gotten @entity24 anyway .			0

@entity12 connects straight to @entity17 ports to stream content from users smartphones , tablets and personal computers
@entity1 is desperate to make inroads into the living room as it would provide a lucrative new channel to sell more advertising
tiny gadget offloads all data processing to the synced device , allowing @entity1 to keep *retail* price competitive
