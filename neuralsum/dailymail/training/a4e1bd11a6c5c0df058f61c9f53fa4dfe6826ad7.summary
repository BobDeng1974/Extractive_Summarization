he said they 're stuck in a legal dispute with a ranch near @entity101 owned by @entity102 and her son @entity103 that was supposed to feed and take care of their horses in a contractual agreement they entered into			1
unimaginable cruelty : officials said the horses have lost 300 - 400lbs over the course of several months tragic sight : five of the animals have died in recent weeks and about 12 others are skin and bones and unlikely to survive they are unable to sell the horses due to the ongoing case			1

@entity16 said their ranch has been in the business of horse breeding for about 30 years , but they were unable to do their annual sale of baby horses last fall due to the legal dispute			1

her son @entity32 ’s facebook page also paints an idyllic picture of their operation , with the photo gallery crammed with images of healthy - looking , glossy horses and joyous celebrations held on the ranch			2
reality , however , has proven to be different			0
authorities have been giving the emaciated horses food and water			0
@entity12 said it likely took about six months of consistent malnourishment for the 12 horses near death to get to that state			2
according to @entity207 sheriff 's deputy @entity206 , most of the horses have lost 300 - @entity208 will likely take the same amount of time for them to recover , if they do			1
@entity12 said it is likely that more horses will die			0
there was only one source of water for the horses , and they had n't been drinking from it , @entity12 said			0
the veterinarian said that 's likely because the water was dirty or causing them to get sick , he said			0
