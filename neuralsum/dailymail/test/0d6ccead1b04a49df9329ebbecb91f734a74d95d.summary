former sports minister @entity0 says new allegations surrounding the @entity3 fire in 1985 which claimed 56 lives do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster			1
a new book claims that the fire at @entity9 was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned by or associated with the club 's then chairman @entity13 , who died in 1995			1
@entity0 , mp for @entity15 and deputy leader of @entity17 at the time of the tragedy , says he knew @entity13 ' flew by the seat of his pants ' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge mr @entity27 that the fire was an accident			1
a memorial to the people who dies in the 1985 fire at @entity9 the judge ruled the fire was started by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand			1
@entity0 said : ' the inquiry by mr @entity27 concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and i have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case			1
' @entity13 was one of those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who flew by the seat of his pants			2
i was deputy leader of the city council at the time and he was did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to paying the bill for the police and so on			2
the fire at @entity3 's @entity9 claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on may 11 , 1985 ' but i think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and i do n't think there needs to be another because of this			1
i do not believe there was any sort of cover - up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the @entity68 report came up with the right answers for football			2
' there will always be speculation but i just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives of 56 people and injured many more , and has scarred the city for many years			0
' the new claims are contained in the book ' @entity80 - @entity79 of the @entity81 ' by @entity82 , who was 12 at the time and escaped with his life from the blaze but lost three generations of his family including his father and brother			2
the book , published on thursday and being serialised in @entity91 , does not make any direct allegations but @entity82 says @entity13 's history with fires , which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £ 27million in today 's terms , warranted further investigation			1
then - @entity3 chairman @entity13 ( left ) with mr @entity27 in front of the burned stand @entity0 does not believe a new inquiry into the @entity3 fire is justified ' could any man really be as unlucky as @entity13 had been ? ' he asks			1
@entity103 said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire			0
detective superintendent @entity107 , of the homicide and @entity109 , said : ' the jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure			0
' however should any evidence come to light which was not available to @entity118 's coroner at the original inquest , then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action			0
' @entity82 's 11 - year - old brother was the fire 's youngest victim while his father @entity124 , 34 , uncle @entity125 , 32 , and grandfather @entity126 , 63 , also died			0
the disaster occurred at a time , according to @entity82 's evidence , when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it wo uld cost £ 2million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by @entity3 's promotion from the old @entity135			2
yet this did not feature in the @entity137 , which held its investigation only three weeks after the fire			0
@entity82 is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry , describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event			0
the book is released on april 16			0
nine days later a minute 's silence is due to be held at every @entity147 and @entity148 match to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary .			0

@entity0 does not believe there should be a fresh inquiry into the fire
the inquiry at the time concluded the fire was started by a discarded cigarette in an old wooden stand
a new book claims former @entity3 chairman @entity13 was linked to previous fires before the disaster
