winner - @entity0 goals - 4 assists - 1 minutes played - 457 despite playing just five games at the @entity15 , @entity1 's star @entity0 won the @entity16 with six goals			1
the @entity19 attacker , who has been heavily linked with a move to @entity21 since his stunning displays in @entity11 , beat @entity6 's @entity5 to the trophy by a single goal			0
he was 100 - 1 with bookmakers to finish top scorer before the start of the tournament			2
@entity5 would have won the award if he had scored in @entity6 's 1 - 0 extra-time win in the final against @entity32 , having registered more assists than @entity0 during the tournament			1
a goal from the @entity36 attacker against @entity38 's side would have made him the first player to win the @entity16 twice , after he won the award in @entity41 in 2010 after scoring five goals			0
the @entity43 forward failed to net at the @entity44 though , meaning @entity0 was crowned top scorer despite leaving the tournament at the quarter - final stage			1
his @entity1 side were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity11 at @entity47 in @entity48 , with @entity0 scoring @entity51 's side 's goal from the spot in the 80th minute			2
the first of that brace was arguably the goal of the tournament , as he chested the ball 30 yards from goal , glanced at where the goalkeeper was standing as the ball dropped , and then smashed a left - foot volley in off the crossbar			0
his penalty against @entity11 took his tally to six - a figure that @entity5 and @entity87 were unable to match despite playing two more games than the 23 - year - old			0
prolific : @entity5 final goal was the opener in @entity6 's 7 - 1 thrashing of @entity11 in the semi-finals efficiency : @entity5 made the most of the chances that fell his way during @entity6 's run to the final composure : @entity43 attacker strokes a shot past @entity103 of @entity104 during @entity6 's win @entity10 , who fractured his back in @entity11 's 2 - 1 victory that sent @entity0 packing , finished in third spot ahead of @entity87 in the final standings			1
the @entity111 scored twice in the opening match of the tournament against @entity114 , and added another brace in their 4 - 1 win over @entity117 in the @entity11 's final group game			0
great start : @entity10 points to the sky after scoring twice in @entity11 's opening match against @entity114 @entity122 cut short : @entity10 scored four goals for @entity11 before fracturing his back against @entity1 quadruple : @entity87 scored four goals for @entity32 at the @entity15 but all were during the group stages match - winner : @entity87 dragged @entity32 to the final of the @entity15 , scoring four goals along the way			2

@entity1 star scored six in five games during run to the quarter - finals
@entity0 was 100 - 1 to be top scorer before the tournament started
@entity5 had a chance to win a second *consecutive* @entity16 after winning the award in 2010 but @entity43 *man* did not net in the final
if @entity5 had scored in the extra-time victory against @entity32 he would have won the trophy *due* to a better assists record
@entity10 finished third in the standings with four goals and one assist
@entity87 had same record but @entity10 *achieved* his in fewer minutes
