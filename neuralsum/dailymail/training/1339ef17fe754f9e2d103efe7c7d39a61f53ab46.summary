@entity1 's critics need to pipe down ... he can become world class @entity5 fans are deluded if @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are all forced to miss saturday ’s @entity11 game at @entity12 through injury then @entity6 should be allowed to request the game is postponed			1
having any player injured on international duty is unfortunate – as @entity17 will testify			1
but to have three of their starting @entity21 all crocked while on @entity19 qualifying duty in the past few days has been spectacularly unlucky			0
if you think this is ridiculous , imagine if it happens to your club			0
now you can see the logic , right ? stop hating @entity6 , and think about this as a ruling that could benefit football , and would possibly help all clubs			2
so it ’s about time the clubs who suffer were given some sort of compensation , other than a token financial gesture			0
there is a problem establishing a rule : how do you decide how many players must be injured before a club can request a postponement ? for me , three seems reasonable ; as long as they ’re all regular first - team players			1
squads should be big enough to cope with one , even two injuries			0
but three players coming back from international games crocked creates a situation that ’s much harder to work with			2
and let ’s face it , if a trio of regular first - team players are out through no fault of the club ’s making , what kind of spectacle will it be ? the @entity11 is brilliant for many reasons but one of the main ones is the competitive spirit from top to bottom – @entity86 can go to the champions and win while @entity88 and @entity89 can find themselves in the top four and newly - promoted @entity91 can put five past @entity6			1
@entity6 manager @entity48 has been left with a depleted squad to choose from on saturday a @entity6 second - string side , with three injuries dumped on them by international football , away to @entity12 , is potentially lambs to the slaughter , and in simple terms it ’s unfair			1
there is no logical reason that says @entity12 should benefit			2
one question that arises from this idea : how many games can be postponed by the club that suffers ? in my opinion , just one			0
that should be long enough for any club to work with the remaining players in the squad and get their act together			2
there is another aspect to this			0
last month i interviewed @entity117 manager @entity116 and asked him how he felt about the @entity119 pair @entity118 and @entity120 missing the game in @entity122 , and then playing for their club a few days later			0
the issue has cropped up again with @entity117 assistant @entity126 saying @entity127 did n’t play for his country , so he does n’t understand the situation from the point of view of an international manager			1
@entity126 says it ’s a relief when he sees @entity118 and @entity120 turn up for the national side			0
@entity118 ( right ) has been involved in a tug of war between @entity119 and @entity117 @entity127 protecting his players is understandable			1
but the pressure of the situation might be eased – and @entity127 more likely to be flexible - if a way of helping clubs after the international break is put in place , if they ’re unlucky enough to suffer injuries			1
it ’s an unlikely scenario but imagine @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 are all injured in @entity149 on tuesday night			0
that would make a total of six @entity6 players injured on international duty			1
it ’s a situation that needs addressing – most clubs would agree with that			0
clubs and countries can work together and this is one way to help improve the relationship between them .			2

@entity12 host @entity6 at the @entity163 on saturday
@entity6 have seen three players injured while on international duty
not fair on clubs to lose first - team players through international injuries
three first - team injuries should be enough to request a postponement
@entity126 hit out at @entity127 for over @entity119 's @entity176 players
clubs and countries need to work together for *mutual* benefit
