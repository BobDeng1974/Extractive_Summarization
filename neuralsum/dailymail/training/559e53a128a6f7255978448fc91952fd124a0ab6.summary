by @entity0 , defence correspondent published : 08:44 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 20:00 est , 22 january 2013 the @entity2 can not refuel its new £ 650million spy planes in mid-air , it has been revealed			1
in a fresh humiliation for the @entity7 , it emerged that @entity8 must rely on other nations to fill up the @entity11 aircraft once it is in the skies			1
military analysts warned that crucial reconnaissance missions could be jeopardised by the @entity8 's failure to act independently			1
but the @entity7 said fuel efficient engines allow the plane to operate for longer while avoiding the spiralling costs and delays involved in converting it			0
ministers bought three second - hand @entity22 from the @entity24 in march 2010 to eavesdrop on enemy communications			1
renamed the @entity11 by the @entity2 , the vintage jets are being introduced to replace the @entity28 surveillance planes axed in 2011 after one blew up over @entity30 , killing all 14 men on board			1
but the @entity2 has been forced to admit that it will only be able to fuel the planes while they are stationary on the ground - making it impossible for them to carry out airborne missions of more than 12 hours without begging allies for help			1
the problem is that the @entity24 and other @entity55 countries use a different method of air - to - air refuelling than the @entity2			1
the @entity58 uses a boom refuelling system so a tanker aircraft would fly ahead of the @entity11 and pass back a rigid , hollow pipe which fits into its tank so fuel can be pumped into it - similar to how a car would be filled up at a petrol station			1
the @entity7 have purchased three @entity11 aircraft , pictured , from the @entity24 which use different methods for refuelling the £ 650million planes will be unable to refuel in mid-air without help from other nations the @entity11 can hold a crew of 27 including three pilots , two navigators and 22 rear crew			1
it weighs 146 tonnes when fully loaded and is 136ft long with a 130ft wingspan			0
with a top speed of 580mph , it has a range of 3,450 miles and can hit a maximum altitude of 50,000ft			0
the @entity7 expects them to be fully operational by 2014			0
the @entity2 , on the other hand , refuels mid-air using a method called ' probe and drogue '			1
@entity8 military tankers trail behind them a shuttlecock - shaped basket known as a ' drogue ' on the end of a hose			2
the plane being refuelled then places a 7 - inch probe into this to fill up its tank			0
the tankers carry 100,000 litres of fuel which is passed to other planes at 5,000 litres a minute - 125 times the speed of garage forecourt pumps			0
an ex-raf officer said : ' it seems to be a terrible blunder			0
the @entity7 attitude is we do n't need to refuel it inflight but that 's absolute rubbish			2
' for a lot of missions , maybe you do n't			0
but if we need to , we ca n't			2
' we 'd have to beg the @entity58 or the @entity114 for help and if they do n't agree with what we 're doing they could turn around and say , " no , we wo n't "			2
' we are losing a sovereign strategic asset and that is a dangerous position to be in			0
' critics claim the @entity7 replaced the nimrod with @entity11 jets because the cash - strapped department could not stretch to buying modern aircraft			1
airseekers were bought from the @entity24 to replace @entity129 ( pictured ) which were axed in 2011 after one aircraft blew up nimrod planes used to be used for surveillance purposes but they had to be ditched by the @entity7 due to safety concerns the spy planes are being converted from @entity136 , built in 1964 , in @entity137 , @entity138			1
once delivered they will be operated by @entity140 at @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity2 sources said the @entity11 can fly for up to ten hours without refuelling so commanders would rarely need to rely on their allies for assistance			1
but they said fitting the spy plane with @entity2 - friendly mid-air refuelling capabilities would have seen costs spiral ' astronomically ' and delay the introduction of the aircraft for several years			2
one officer said : ' this is not the gold - standard but that was not possible in the time frame we wanted to have the planes in operation			0
' would we like to be able to refuel independently ? yes			0
is it essential ? no. ' it is not the first refuelling glitch to hit the @entity2			0
last year , the @entity7 faced criticism after it emerged its new £ 10.5billion refuelling planes did not work on @entity8 fighter jets			2
tests revealed that the new fleet of giant @entity170 tankers leaked fuel when trying to fill up @entity172 and @entity173 mid-flight			0
engineers discovered ' problems ' with the connecting pipes which join the aircraft so fuel can be pumped to the warplanes			0
defence sources said the @entity7 had opted to buy the aircraft ' off the shelf ' to ensure the @entity2 had the operational intelligence and surveillance capability in service more swiftly			0
an @entity7 spokesman said : ' @entity11 will shortly provide the @entity2 with a vital surveillance and intelligence capability			2
' air - to - air refuelling is not essential for the aircraft as @entity11 's new fuel efficient engines allow it to operate for longer			2
where required , it can be refuelled by the @entity8 's @entity55 allies and the @entity58			1

three second hand @entity11 jets have been bought from the @entity24 to replace the @entity2 's @entity28
but the @entity2 use a different system to refuel jets mid-air which is n't *compatible* with @entity58 aircraft
military analysts warn reconnaissance missions could be put at risk as @entity8 will need other nations ' help to refuel planes
@entity11 will be limited to 12 hours flying time if they ca n't refuel mid-air
