@entity0 are the gateway to @entity3 care – nine out of 10 times , the first contact a patient has with the health system is through their gp			1
yet access to @entity0 has become a major policy and political issue			0
the crisis in @entity14 has led some to blame a lack of available gp appointments for people heading to emergency departments instead			1
weekend opening hours for @entity0 has been touted as one solution - by improving access , many patients wo n’t need to take up other care services			1
the crisis in @entity14 has led some people to blame a lack of available gp appointments , prompting more people to visit the emergency department instead since the summer of 2013 , a number of @entity30 in @entity31 have been piloting seven - day opening , as part of the @entity35 initiative - funding for which was recently increased from £ 50 million to £ 100 million			1
through the @entity35 , gp surgeries were asked to bid for funds for extra opening hours , but this was solely for set - up costs , for example , the sharing of medical records			1
running costs had to be covered by surgeries from existing budgets			0
we wanted to know whether the flow of patients to @entity14 from four of these pilots in central @entity31 changed compared to a control group of 30 other surgeries in central @entity31			2
in our study , we found an eight per cent drop in @entity14 attendances among patients of the pilot surgeries compared to the control group			2
we also found an eight per cent drop in @entity14 admissions among elderly patients , those aged 65 or more , of the pilot surgeries			2
this is because cautious doctors in emergency departments are more likely to admit elderly patients to hospital , while @entity0 , familiar with their case histories , may be more comfortable treating and sending them back home			0
the effect was also largest at weekends			0
and the fall was only in cases of mild to moderate severity			0
there was no effect in the most urgent cases such as those caused by accidents or brought to @entity14 in ambulance			2
weekend opening hours for @entity0 has been touted as one solution to relieve the mounting pressure on @entity14 departments - by improving access , it is thought many patients wo n’t need to take up other care services based on these findings , we calculated that this eight per cent fall would translate into two million fewer visits to @entity14 each year if weekend opening was made available nationally			1
given that the average cost of a @entity8 consultation is about £ 27 , while that of an @entity14 visit is £ 114 , two million fewer @entity14 visits would imply a cost saving of £ 194 million for the @entity3			1
from research carried out by @entity97 and colleagues , we know that there is an association between gp access and the number of non-urgent @entity14 visits			1
in 2010 - 11 , the gp surgeries that were most accessible also had lower @entity14 non-urgent visits compared to the gp surgeries with the least access			1
a one point increase in the percentage of registered patients who seek gp appointments within two week days increases non-urgent visits by 0.7 per cent			1
increased travel time to hospital also reduces non-urgent @entity14 visits			2
out - of - hour services and walk - in centres , of course are already available			0
the last @entity120 government encouraged extra hours but the policy was eventually dropped			0
on the whole , most of us are happy with access to our gp			0
in a survey of @entity8 patients conducted in 2014 , three - quarters of respondents said that they found opening hours convenient			1
but among those who found gp opening hours inconvenient , 74 per cent wanted surgeries to be open on saturdays , 71 per cent late hours ( after 6.30pm ) and 37 per cent wanted them open on sundays			1
around 24 per cent of people said it was not easy to get through to their surgery on the phone			0
one issue is also about the demographic of service users			0
the crisis has become a key political issue			0
@entity144 has promised to introduce seven - day access to gp services by 202 , while @entity147 has vowed to introduce a 48 - hour target for gp appointments as one gp put it : ' longer opening is a fine idea but the problem is that the people who see us the most - young children and elderly - are the ones that do n’t have a problem with appointments on a monday afternoon			1
@entity120 has promised a 48 - hour target for gp appointments ( at a cost of £ 100 million ) , while the @entity163 have promised a seven - day access to gp services by 2020			1
@entity144 said that the move could take pressure off @entity14 wards which are ' not the right place for frail , elderly people '			2
seven - day opening , however , does not actually mean all surgeries are open all week			0
in many places , weekend or late opening is rotated between nearby surgeries			0
it ’s a practical and cheap solution , especially for small surgeries which have less resources to spend , fewer gp and nursing staff , so less flexibility in adding weekend shifts			2
further evaluation of other pilots may point us towards the most cost - effective arrangement for weekend openings .			0
