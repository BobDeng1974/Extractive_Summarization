the wife of @entity1 is reportedly spending £ 10million on building a fully equipped medical suite in their family home so her husband can leave the hospital			1
even though @entity8 , 45 , has been told by doctors it is highly unlikely the racing ace will ever wake up from his medically induced coma , she has decided to use the family 's £ 500million fortune to build the facility in their lavish £ 25million estate on the banks of @entity19 , @entity20			1
today is the three month anniversary of the @entity23 skiing accident where the seven - time @entity25 champion , 45 , hit his head and was put into an induced coma to reduce brain swelling			1
bring him home : reports had claimed that @entity8 planned to build a multi-million pound facility so her husband can leave hospital , but these were subsequently denied by family and friends of the former @entity25 ace successful : the £ 25million estate on the shores of @entity19 where the @entity1 family live since then , there have been few encouraging signs of recovery and the racing ace has been wasting away in his hospital bed , losing 25 per cent of his body mass to now only weigh 8st 7lbs			1
a friend of the @entity1 's , who has known the family for 25 years @entity49 said : ' miracles happen , of course , and as a wealthy man he has the best care money can buy			2
' but all the money in the world can not fix what has happened to him			0
the family are making arrangements for a future of permanent immobility			0
' is there a sense of denial at play among them ? i would say yes ' the family 's life has been taken over by the accident , every day they make the 150 - mile round trip from their home in @entity20 to the @entity75 , @entity76 , where @entity1 is receiving the best possible care			1
they spend up to ten hours by his bedside , offering up prayers for his recovery , before returning home in the evening			0
@entity84 skier : thrill - seeker @entity1 had been a keen and skilled skier before his accident in december waiting : the @entity75 , where @entity1 has been in an induced coma for three months mrs @entity8 has always been a devoted wife , extremely supportive of her husband 's career			1
mr @entity1 once said : ' it is not so easy to find a partner who unconditionally adapts to the pace of my life			0
' both growing up in the same region of @entity96 , @entity1 and @entity8 met at a party in 1991 and fell in love			2
the pact that has seen their loving relationship endure is that she allows him pursue his high - octane career and , in return , he would give her everything she could want			0
with an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half - a - billion pounds , @entity1 's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years			1
this will include physiotherapists , to massage his atrophying joints , doctors , nutritionists , nurses and neurological experts			0
he used the staggering fortunes from his 22 - year career to snap up a ranch in @entity121 , where @entity8 raises horses , as well as apartments and ski chalets around the world - including the one in @entity126 from which he set out on the tragic day late last year			2
loving support : @entity8 arrives at the hospital to which she and family make a daily 150 - mile round trip he even built the estate on @entity19 where the new medical facility will be installed			1
as a result , mrs @entity8 refuses to give up on the man she once described as the ' perfect partner '			0
the family friend told @entity49 she ' would view breaking faith with the hope of a miracle a betrayal , little better than treachery			2
' she feels that the family communes around his bedside pulsate their hope and love to him , and that of the millions of fans worldwide who share that faith			0
' she ca n’t express defeat because that would be the end of her			0

the medical facility will be built in the family 's £ 25million @entity20 estate
doctors think it is unlikely @entity1 will ever wake up
despite grim *prognosis* , the seven - time @entity25 champion 's family will not give up
the family are currently making 150 - mile round trip to his bedside daily
family friend said @entity8 would see giving up as a ' betrayal '
