wanted man : @entity0 intend to keep striker @entity2 at the @entity16 next season inconsistent : @entity2 scored 23 goals last season but he did not net after january such overtures would not be welcomed and , in any case , @entity0 now have a higher valuation of the 28 - year - old than the reported figure , which equals the amount they paid @entity26 for him last summer			1
