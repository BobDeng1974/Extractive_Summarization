rarely can a headline in a matchday magazine have been so prophetic : on pages 16 and 17 of the @entity2 , next to a picture of @entity4 , screamed the words ‘ right place , right time ’			1
that has n’t always been the case during the @entity11 ’s debut season at @entity12			1
between october 20 and february 17 , @entity4 was barely sighted and started just three of the 21 games @entity14 played in that period , prompting much chatter about his place in the squad			1
it is no secret @entity21 wanted to bring @entity4 to @entity12 on deadline day in august 2013 but red tape scuppered his ambitions ; @entity14 pressed ahead with transfer after @entity21 was jettisoned but his inactivity prompted questions : did @entity28 want him or rate him ? @entity4 , pictured with @entity29 , netted a brace to ensure his side claimed the win against @entity33 @entity4 has established himself in @entity28 's first team plans after missing out in previous months @entity35 ( right ) congratulates two - goal hero @entity4 ( centre ) after the final whistle the settling in process was not easy but the 25 - year - old ’s head has never dropped and in the interview with the club publication , @entity4 made it clear that a lack of action was never going to leave him at loggerheads with @entity47			1
‘ i am very happy , he said			2
‘ even when i was n’t playing , i was also happy			0
i feel really lucky to be here			0
we have to respect his decision			0
he wants the best for us , the team and we have to follow him always			0
’ @entity4 ’s commitment was amply rewarded against @entity33			1
the brightest spark in a red jersey , he was certainly in the right place at the right time in the 43rd minute , when sweeping a terrific effort past @entity61 to set @entity14 on their way			2
his passing was slick , his movement was clever and it was appropriate he bookended this victory with @entity14 ’s third in injury time ; it was fifth shot on target in the @entity70 and , amazingly , his fifth goal			1
no wonder he left with acclaim from his manager ringing in his ears			0
‘ i knew @entity4 has @entity76 , ’ said @entity47			2
‘ sometimes he was not composed at the right moment but now he has composure			0
scoring seven goals in a season when he has n’t played so much ? i think that ’s fantastic			0

@entity4 fired @entity14 to victory with *double* against @entity33
the @entity11 put in a man - of - the - match *display* at @entity12
@entity4 *struggled* for games between october and february
however he now *appears* to be an *integral* *member* of @entity14 's squad
