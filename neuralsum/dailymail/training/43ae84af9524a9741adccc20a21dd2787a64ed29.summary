fined : @entity10 was given a parking ticket despite keeping his bike behind yellow lines and out of the way of pedestrians and cars the nursing home worker was about to set off for work from his home in @entity31 when he found the ticket , and claims he is a victim of ' underhand tactics '			1

' i have been riding a bike for four years and this is the first time i have had a ticket for something like this. , ' he said			1
' it 's not doing any harm to anyone			2
it 's parked there so i can keep an eye on it			2
there 's an alleyway opposite without any double yellows but if i parked it up there it would block people walking up and down , while at the moment it 's completely out of the way			2
i think they use little cases like this to make money			0
' they have just seen this and thought technically it 's double yellow lines so let 's just give him a ticket			1
they just do n't use their common sense			0
' i have spoken to a few neighbours and they think it 's ridiculous			2
' narrow : mr @entity10 has agreed with neighbours he will keep his motorbike behind the yellow lines as it keeps the narrow street in @entity31 clear mr @entity10 has contested the ticket and it is currently being reviewed by @entity84			1

that 's the only parking available , ' he said			0

' a property boundary relates to the edge of a building , or in the case of a property having a forecourt or garden , to the edge of the forecourt or garden			0
' areas at the side of roads adjacent to property boundaries that are n't privately owned are automatically adopted highway			0
' the yellow lines are sited for safety reasons			0
it is illegal for a vehicle to wait on a yellow line during the controlled hours , regardless of the length of time involved , unless it is otherwise exempt from the regulations			0
