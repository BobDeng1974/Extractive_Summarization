an army of @entity3 terrorists has advanced to the outskirts of @entity5 , @entity0 has cut off routes to @entity7 and @entity8 – prime minister of ' @entity10 ' – has deported all immigrants who have arrived in the past ten years			1
this , according to the @entity12 , is what the world would be like if the @entity15 were to collapse			1
the apocalyptic vision of a continent in which social order has broken down – to be screened on @entity19 tonight at 10pm – has been condemned by @entity21 critics as ' scaremongering '			1
the @entity12 describes @entity36 as an ' authored documentary ' , but the film – which features comedian @entity39 as an archaeologist struggling to explain what the single currency was to a young girl sitting next to him on a plane – has been criticised as a hyped - up piece of @entity48 propaganda			1
horrifying images of concentration camp victims are interspersed with wartime footage of devastated cities , while commentary is provided by former economist editor @entity54 , who made the film with @entity57 journalist @entity56			1
the terrifying sequence of events ends with @entity60 resigning as @entity62 president and overseeing a vote to abolish the @entity15			1
in his commentary , mr @entity54 admits immigration imposes financial burdens on nations but insists that in the long term it creates the resources needed to maintain a welfare state			1
in the film , the girl – apparently being deported from @entity72 because she has an @entity57 mother – asks @entity39 about pictures of bridges on an old euro banknote			2
he tells her : ' they were supposed to symbolise unity , unification , all the countries being connected			0
it was a great idea but unfortunately it did n't work			0
' ' faction ' : the @entity12 describes @entity36 as an ' authored documentary ' , but the film has been criticised as a hyped - up piece of @entity48 propaganda			1
mr @entity54 and ms @entity56 say the film expresses their personal views and is intended to provoke debate			1
but last night it was condemned by @entity91 eurosceptic mp sir @entity90 as ' scaremongering '			0
he said : ' it would be much better if the @entity12 provided us with a proper analysis of what has gone wrong with @entity32 structures			1
' and @entity91 mep @entity98 said : ' this is typical of the pro-eu side			0
they make such ludicrous claims they make themselves look ridiculous			0
' tonight 's broadcast will be followed by a discussion by a panel of guests including @entity109 columnist @entity108 and @entity110 mp @entity110			0
a @entity12 spokesman said : ' @entity12 editorial guidelines do not prevent the commissioning of programmes which approach subjects from a particular perspective			2
' and mr @entity54 said : ' it 's a warning of what could happen if @entity32 continues on its current path			1
' comment by @entity108 even the @entity12 sometimes grasps that it has gone too far			2
and 11 days ago , it went into a five - star panic over its plan to show a more - or-less crazy @entity48 film tonight			1
i assume that , spooked by the derisive reaction to its laughable @entity128 drama @entity129 , its chiefs suddenly realised that they had another embarrassment on their hands			0
the planned transmission was abruptly cut by several minutes , losing a large chunk about the migration wave across the @entity135			0
and this helped make space for a post-programme discussion , heavily loaded with critics of the @entity15 , including me , former chancellor @entity140 and @entity110 mp @entity110			2
this is really a figleaf to cover its naked bias , as you will see when you watch it tonight			0
i took part because it seemed silly to miss any opportunity to make the case for @entity72 independence			0
i 'm very happy for @entity54 to make as many films as he likes for the @entity12 about the wonders of the @entity15			1
the trouble is , you can not imagine the corporation giving anyone the chance to make a film about how miserable it will be if @entity72 stays in , and how good it will be if we leave			0
for this programme is blatant propaganda			2
and the only cause for joy is that it 's not very good propaganda			0
a doomed plane is zig - zagging across a divided , blacked - out @entity32 , bearing @entity39 and a little girl who has supposedly been deported from a xenophobic , cruel @entity10 because her mother is n't paid enough			1
this provides the excuse for a patronising series of lecturettes from mr @entity39			0
everything about it is run through with the stupid , ill - informed prejudices of the @entity12			2
opponents of the @entity15 are portrayed as ' anti-european ' nostalgists and haters of abroad			2
opponents of immigration are portrayed as dislikers of immigrants			0
things which are the @entity15 's own fault , such as its self - inflicted economic crisis , are not blamed on the @entity15			1
wild fantasies are explored in which a @entity72 departure causes everyone else to leave – though why they would , if it is so wonderful , i can not tell			0
baseless guff , about how the @entity15 has brought peace , is repeated unquestioned			2
in fact , to the extent that it has had any influence on war and peace , the @entity15 has brought war , most recently thanks to its aggressive push into @entity199			0
@entity202 's @entity201 speech of 1946 , which it partly quotes , is a plea for continental @entity32 to unite , with @entity72 , the @entity204 and the @entity205 acting as outside sponsors			0
oh , and the @entity208 airport for which the fictitious plane is originally bound closed in 2008 , as anyone who knows @entity32 would be aware .			1

apocalyptic vision of @entity32 descending into social chaos aired tonight
@entity19 programme condemned by @entity21 as ' pro-eu propaganda '
@entity12 say the great @entity32 disaster movie is ' authored documentary '
it shows terrorists advancing to @entity5 , @entity8 as prime minister
in the film , mr @entity54 warns : ' our worry is that if @entity32 continues on its current path , the @entity15 will collapse and that that would have *catastrophic* consequences for all of us . ' viewers see a *glimpse* of a @entity231 continent in which : visas and landing cards are required for travel between @entity32 countries ;
a power crisis in @entity239 has put @entity208 airport out of action .
the new president of @entity244 , far - right leader @entity243 , has declared a state of *emergency* .
@entity15 chiefs , meeting in @entity208 , have abolished the euro .
