@entity0 admitted pitches like the one in @entity2 make it easier to make centuries and harder to win games , as @entity6 batted themselves into a position of relative comfort on day four of the second test			1
regardless of the state of the wicket , @entity0 was in superb touch on his way to 182 not out in the morning session , his second highest score and the fourth of his six hundreds to pass the 150 mark			1
but for the second match in a row @entity19 's hopes of pushing for victory were railroaded by a dead pitch that was arguably better for run - making than on day one			1
@entity0 hits another ball to the boundary on his way to an impressive big hundred in @entity2 @entity0 admitted that the flat pitch made it too easy to score runs and too tough to take wickets @entity0 's efforts left the @entity6 with a 165 - run deficit , but they cleared that to finish 37 ahead on 202 for two at stumps			1
speaking after the match , @entity0 lifted the lid on the tourists ' frustrations			1
' these pitches are great for batters because we get big scores but as far as test cricket is concerned , it 's not ideal , ' he said			0
' unfortunately , it 's a very unresponsive pitch and it 's been hard work ' we all thought it might break up a little bit more and give a little bit more spin than it has done , but unfortunately it has n't happened			2
' this is what we 've got to deal with , and we 've just got to get on the best we can			0
' @entity58 , who eventually took the wicket of @entity60 , found the going tough in @entity2 @entity61 sees the ball disappear to the boundary once again as @entity19 struggled on day four in all likelihood , the destiny of the game will be decided in the morning			1
@entity19 are five overs away from a new ball - which has been the only bankable way of making things happen - and must make it count with a cluster of wickets to set themselves for success			1
' we 're going to need a very good first hour in the morning , ' he said			2
' with the new ball we 'll need a couple of early wickets and you never know			2
they 're only 40 ahead , so if it 's bang bang in the morning we 've got a game on our hands			0
' that would definitely give us the best chance of winning the game on a very flat wicket			0
' our only chance is wickets with the new ball , whether it be with seam or spin , that 's the way it looks at the moment , but you never know			0
' @entity0 admitted that @entity19 need early wickets with the new ball , just as @entity96 achieved on day four @entity6 go in to the final morning with @entity97 on 101 not out having compiled a dogged fourth @entity99 ton and @entity19 's tormentor - in - chief @entity100 alongside			1
@entity100 , who memorably saluted @entity61 after his dismissal on the third evening , was not sledged when he arrived at the crease but @entity0 had no guarantees that would continue			2
' everyone was very well behaved tonight , there was no - one speaking up , ' he added			0
' we 'll see how tomorrow goes			0
concentration might come into it , and maybe a bit of banter could spice things up a bit			0

@entity0 scored 182 *** but *criticises* *lifeless* pitch in @entity2
@entity19 struggled to take wickets on fourth day , as draw looks likely
@entity0 admits @entity19 ' need a very good first hour ' to force a result
