a little dishy was n't quite big enough for this fishy - nor was the door of @entity4 's restaurant			1
the owner of the @entity7 eatery in @entity8 forked out £ 1,500 the huge halibut and had it shipped to his restaurant in a refrigerated truck			1
only when it arrived did mr @entity4 realise just how big the seven - foot tall , 16 - stone whopper actually was			1
little dishy ? @entity4 ( left ) and chef @entity15 ( right ) realise they might need a bigger pan for the halibut the 38 - year - old restaurateur had to resort to filleting the 103kg fish in the restaurant forecourt with the help of fellow chef @entity15 before he could get it into the kitchen on the second floor			1
passers - by watched in amazement as they laid plastic on the ground and set to the halibut with knives			1
' we got a call from the fish market saying one of the trawlers had caught this huge fish and asked if i would be interested in taking it , ' mr @entity4 said			1
' i jumped at the chance because we specialise in seafood dishes and i wanted to have a halibut week at the restaurant			2
' i did n't realise how big it was until it arrived though			0
' our kitchen is upstairs and there was no way we could fit it inside			0
i had n't really given it much thought before it arrived			0
not your usual plaice : the halibut had to be filleted in the forecourt of the restaurant before it could be carried to the second floor kitchen ' myself and my chef @entity55 had to take it off the bone outside			1
' it took about an hour and people passing by could n't believe it , we stopped the traffic on the street outside and nearly caused an accident			0
' the fish was very heavy and it was very slippery to handle			0
' we had to get three guys to suspend it with a rope from our top window just to get our photo taken with it			0
' mr @entity4 paid £ 15 a kilo - £ 1,545 in total - for the halibut at @entity72 after it was line caught off the north coast of @entity76			1
the 200 that he managed to carve it into were gobbled up by diners in less than a week			2
mr @entity4 added : ' there was a lot of talk about it in the town because so many people had saw it when it arrived			2
' it sold it in less than a week			0
' catches like that are fairly rare but i would definitely buy another one			0
' @entity92 out : the fish cost £ 15 per kilo and cost £ 1,545 in total at 16 stones , @entity4 's fish is still somewhat shy of the largest halibut ever caught - a 34st whopper caught by @entity100 angler @entity99 in 2010 , which was sold for £ 2,500			1
the previous largest halibut was a 33st fish caught off @entity103 in 2009			2
earlier this year , staff at the @entity106 restaurant in @entity107 took delivery of an 11st halibut			0
@entity111 halibut are among the largest fish in the world and can grow up to 15ft long .			0
