so @entity0 is on the brink of joining @entity2 and completing the shock move of the summer			1
when i first saw the news breaking , my initial reaction was ‘ this ca n’t be true ’ ; i had serious misgivings			0
since then , though , i have changed my stance because of the economics — £ 16million for a 24 - year - old who is @entity13 ’s @entity12 striker looks a great deal			1
if you consider @entity17 moved from @entity18 to @entity19 for £ 11m , it is even better value			2
i admit he still has to convince me as a player			0
people talk about his behaviour off the pitch — that does n’t worry me too much and , in truth , i think some of it is quite funny			0
it is what happens when he crosses that white line that is important , and he has yet to show me he is as good as some people have claimed			0
we faced each other a few times when he was in @entity48 and i never saw a lot from him at @entity50			1
he was subbed in his three appearances there and sent off after 18 minutes as a substitute			0
on target : @entity0 celebrates after scoring against @entity48 during @entity13 's 2 - 1 @entity56 victory in june ordered off : @entity0 is shown a red card during @entity59 's 1 - 0 defeat by @entity60 in april 2012 there is , however , a player lurking in that frame			1
he has been outstanding on the two occasions he faced @entity48 at major tournaments , causing problems with his pace and power			0
if he ’s like that , @entity2 will have done some smart business			2
@entity71 will find three games a week difficult , so there will be rotation issues and how they play as a pair will be intriguing			0
above all , @entity2 have a fabulous spirit under @entity77 that has carried them far			1
@entity0 ca n’t be allowed to jeopardise that			1
sending out a message : @entity0 ( left ) and @entity80 wear ' i love @entity83 ' t - shirts in 2011			2

@entity0 is on the brink of joining the @entity50 club
signing @entity13 's no 1 striker for £ 16million looks a great deal
@entity0 can not be allowed to jeopardise @entity2 's *fantastic* team spirit
