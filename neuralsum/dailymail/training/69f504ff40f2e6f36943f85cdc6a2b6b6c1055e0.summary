being trampled on by a three - tonne elephant is not usually the first thing that springs to mind when thinking about ways to relieve stress			0
but tourists are flocking to a jungle camp in @entity6 for just that			2
the spa treatment is being offered in @entity10 province , where a number of @entity13 elephants - that weigh anywhere from 2.25 to 5.5 tonnes - administer the massage using their trunks and feet			1
@entity27 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , captured two foreign tourists - one male and another female - lying on the ground with a towel over their midriff			0
the giant @entity13 elephant is then led up to the tourists by a mahout , before ' gently ' patting them to replicate the techniques used by masseurs			1
that hits the spot : a tourists giggles as she is stepped on by one of the jumbos which weigh between 2.25 to 5.5 tonnes just relax : the elephants administer the massages using both their trunks and feet that might hurt : a tourists grins despite having a elephant 's foot pressing down on his groin @entity27 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , captured two foreign tourists - one male and another female - lying on the ground receiving the unusual therapy @entity27 said : ' during my travels around @entity13 i have seen many unusual animal massages including one with four @entity63 pythons			1
' in places like @entity6 entrepreneurial safari park owners see it as a way of making some extra money			2
' but this elephant one is a little more challenging purely thanks to the animals sheer size and power			0
the spa treatment , which is being offered in @entity10 , @entity6 , is certainly not for the feint hearted perks of the job : one of the elephant handlers , known a mahouts , gets a back rub from a jumbo firm pressure please : the @entity13 elephant have been trained to replicate the techniques used by masseurs ' it looked quite dangerous and i saw many years ago the perils when an elephant stepped on a tourist 's leg			1
you can imagine what happened and the pain that person was in			0
' but if you are brave enough , it is one for the bucket list			0
