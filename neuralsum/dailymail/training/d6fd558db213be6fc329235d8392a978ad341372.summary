the £ 4billion battle for live tv coverage of the @entity2 is set to be a three - way contest			2
the current dominance of @entity5 and @entity6 is likely to be challenged by @entity7 , the @entity9 documentary channel , when bidding for the 2016 - 19 seasons closes friday			1
the fierce competition for the seven packages of matches up for grabs , which total of 168 live games a season , could see the price of a single live game rise to an amazing £ 8m			1
@entity5 and @entity6 are set to battle @entity7 as well for 2016 - 19 @entity2 rights such a bonanza would bring in more than £ 4bn over three years from the domestic tv market alone with another healthy increase on the current £ 2bn from overseas deals to come later			1
this is as well as the £ 204m already agreed with the @entity26 for @entity27 highlights			0
the biggest winners from this windfall will , as ever , be the @entity2 players with £ 200,000 - a - week contracts for the elite stars likely to become more commonplace			0
@entity5 are expected to pour all their resources into retaining at least four of their prime first pick packages while @entity6 will want an increase on their 38 live games per season			2
and @entity38 , who own @entity40 , are also keen on a slice of the live @entity2 action			0
there are seven packages of matches up for grabs , which total of 168 live games a season and there ’s still speculation in a tender , in which all those involved have had to sign strict confidentiality agreements , over whether @entity56 - based @entity55 , the richest tv network in the world , will make a bid			1
meanwhile , broadcast regulators @entity59 have , as expected , turned down @entity61 ’s fanciful appeal to postpone the rights auction until their complaint about the sales process is fully investigated			0
such a bonanza would bring in more than £ 4billion over three years from the domestic tv market alone			0
