by @entity0 a group of lucky surfers had a very close encounter with a large whale on @entity6 's northern beaches on sunday			1
however they were warned to steer clear of the southern right whale as they were spotted just metres from the huge marine mammal at @entity11			1
footage from the @entity14 helicopter showed the group surrounding the creature as it slowly swam and splashed near the surface			1

' to be honest they were harassing it a bit			0
they were so close and it had no room to move ... if i was the fish i 'd be harassed too			0
it 'd move a bit and they 'd back off , ' he said			0

' the whale was within the confines of our beach , just having a sticky beak and some riders went out to have a look , ' mr @entity78 said			0
