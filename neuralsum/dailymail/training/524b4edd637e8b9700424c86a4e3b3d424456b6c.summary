@entity0 could face a huge tax bill after a failed appeal over a £ 290m tax avoidance scheme in which he was involved former @entity4 dj @entity0 could be landed with a huge tax bill after a court ruled against a £ 290m tax avoidance scheme in which he was involved			1
the breakfast show presenter - who netted a £ 700,000 annual salary from the @entity11 until he left his job in september 2012 - claimed he had incurred losses as a second - hand car dealer so he could avoid paying £ 1m in tax			1
but the self - proclaimed ' saviour of @entity17 ' was challenged by the taxman and the scheme - dubbed ' @entity19 ' - was later rejected by a tribunal			1
now @entity23 ( ' @entity22 , which promoted the scheme , has warned working wheels investors that @entity25 ' will seek to collect outstanding tax and interest , ' according to @entity28			1
the paper said two of @entity0 's fellow investors tried to appeal again the ruling , but failed			0
in a letter seen by the paper , the boss of @entity34 said it was a ' disappointing result ' which he believed had been ' very much affected ' by press coverage about tax avoidance			1
he wrote : ' clearly this is a disappointing result , made the more given our efforts to be heard by the higher courts have been thwarted			2
' we believe that the courts , especially the lower tribunals , are being very much affected by press coverage on tax avoidance and that is a dangerous development in any judicial system			2
' @entity0 was one of 450 celebrities , fund managers and other top earners to try to avoid tax by taking part in the scheme			1
it worked by allowing members of the scheme to say they had incurred huge fees while working in the second - hand car trade , which they could claim back against their tax bill			1
variants of the scheme included claiming losses from dealing in other high - value items such as watches or cash receivables			2
he moved his earnings around a string of banks and charitable trusts to claim that he had made the loss			0
but the tax tribunal ruled this was just a ruse to save tax			1
it found that , far from being a car dealer , @entity0 had never supplied any vehicles and had ' no interest ' in doing so			1
the ' saviour of @entity17 ' pictured in january 2004 , on his first day of presenting the radio 1 breakfast show @entity0 took to @entity87 after the ruling to say that he always thought the scheme was legal nor did he have the faintest idea how much the cars he was supposedly trading cost to buy and to sell			2
when @entity25 rejected the scheme , @entity0 and two other members appealed to a tax court			1
in february this year , tax judge @entity96 rejected the appeal , saying it was clear he ' entered the scheme for no purpose other than to achieve a tax saving '			0
he said the ' scale of mr @entity0 ' borrowing was driven solely by the amount of the tax loss he wanted to achieve			0
@entity25 is said to be seeking to recoup the outstanding tax and interest from the scheme the ruling said @entity0 was ' anxious to be reassured the scheme was lawful , and that he would not have to undertake any trading himself '			1
after the outcome , @entity0 took to @entity87 to say : ' upon advice , i signed up to a scheme which i was assured was legal			2
my knowledge of the dealings of the scheme were naive			0
i 'm not a tax expert and acted on advice			0
this was a mistake and i accept the ruling without reservation			0
' but during his year - long battle with the taxman , @entity0 desperately tried to keep his avoidance scheme secret			1
his legal team argued the tribunal should be heard behind closed doors so as not to infringe his ' right to respect for his private and family life '			0
his lawyer also said if his membership were exposed , ' his career might be damaged '			0
judge @entity96 rejected this on the grounds there was an obvious public interest in keeping tax cases public			0
many of the organisations involved in the scheme were based in low - tax and highly private jurisdictions such as @entity143 , the @entity144 and the @entity145			0
a @entity25 spokesman said : ' we do n't in general comment on individual cases			0
' we are always happy to help the increasing numbers of people who want to disentangle themselves from the fruitless practice of tax avoidance			2
' @entity154 has contacted mr @entity0 's representatives for comment .			0
