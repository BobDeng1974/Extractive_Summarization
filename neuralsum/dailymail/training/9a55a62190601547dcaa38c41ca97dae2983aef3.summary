the sun ’s fiery surface is captured in incredible detail from 93million miles away			0
the stunning shot was taken by 71 - year - old @entity8 , a photographer and amateur astronomer			1
streaks of superheated plasma rising across the sun 's surface - as seen from @entity14 the back garden astronomer : the dome in @entity18 's garden , containing the equipment used to take pictures of the sun like many of us mr @entity8 has the odd pot plant and a shed in his back garden			1
but , where we might have the compost heap or a vegetable patch , he has installed a 5 - inch refracting telescope , equipped with a hydrogen - alpha solar filter			1
the filter allows him to safely observe and photograph the high - energy activity on our nearest @entity33 said : ‘ when you look at the @entity35 you are looking at a star in high - magnification and detail – it is fascinating			2
it is about understanding our existence and our place in the solar system			0
’ mr @entity8 , from @entity14 , in @entity44 , pieced together thousands of frames using computer software to create the picture			0
a detailed photograph of the sun with an apparent smile captured using a telescope fitted with a special filter in @entity14 by amateur astronomer @entity18 a side - no view of a plasma burst - known as a prominence when viewed from the side - captured in @entity14 @entity18 and the equipment he used to take pictures of the sun in @entity14 what appear to be bursts of flame are known as filaments – when huge masses of superheated plasma jump off the @entity35 ’s surface			1
they are formed by short - lived magnetic loops hundreds of thousands of miles long that hold dense gas suspended thousands of miles above the @entity72 surface of the @entity35 mr @entity8 photographed the @entity35 from february 15 to 19 , but was unable to follow it any further because of cloudy weather			1
the retired engineer , who lives with wife @entity76 , a teacher , and son @entity78 , 18 , has been a keen astronomer for the last 40 years			0
he built his first telescope when he was 29 and has been an enthusiast ever since			0
after taking the pictures , mr @entity8 pieced the images together like a jigsaw puzzle using computer software			0
the filament appears etched on the surface of the sun but is actually far away from it , as the sideways photographs clearly show			0
@entity8 uses computer software to piece together thousands of images taken from his back garden in @entity14 to produce this stunning portrait of the sun a streak of superheated plasma across the surface of the sun - captured from a @entity14 back garden when the filament is seen from the side like this - it is known as a prominence			1
mr @entity8 said : ' filaments occur when magnetic fields have snapped			2
' this in turn causes the local hydrogen plasma to jump off the surface of the sun in a sweeping arc			0
' the telescope was fitted with a hydrogen alpha filter to capture these incredible shots from 93 million miles away the white ' clouds ' around the filament are breaks in the magnetic field			1
@entity8 , a retired @entity118 mechanical designer , imaged the sun over 5 days			2
@entity120 has also produced its own version of @entity8 's images - but relies on an orbiting spacecraft to capture its shots of activity on the sun 's surface			2
71 year - old @entity18 build his own observatory to house his five inch telescope @entity18 poses with the 5 - inch refracting telescope equipped with a hydrogen alpha filter used to capture images of the sun in @entity14			1

amateur solar - photographer @entity8 , 71 , used a 5 - inch refracting telescope equipped with a hydrogen - alpha solar filter
shows a ' filament ' - a snapped magnetic field , appearing to give the sun a facial expression
