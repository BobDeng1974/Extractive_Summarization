the guide is the first published by @entity1 since it became a women 's magazine in the 1960s known as the high - street sex bible , women ’s magazine @entity1 has once again pushed boundaries when it comes to bedroom advice			1
the magazine has published its very first sex guide for lesbian couples in its 50 year history			1
in keeping with other erotic material published by the magazine , the piece entitled ’ 28 mind - blowing lesbian sex positions ’ has graphic descriptions for each one			1
containing step - by - step information on exotic sounding positions such as the ‘ kinky jockey ’ , the ‘ tawdry tire - swing ’ , the ‘ erotic maypole ’ and the ‘ sexy spider ’ , the guide also has accompanying explicit drawings for each			1
requiring a variety of props , including sex toys , handcuffs , chairs the guide includes role playing ( think , good cop bad cop type scenarios ) as well as mild s&m			2
while not for the prudish or faint - of - heart , the guide marks an increasing inclusion of homosexual relationships in mainstream media			0
@entity1 has over 1.6 million readers worldwide , making it the largest young women ’s magazine worldwide			1
originally started as a family magazine in @entity48 in 1886 , it only took its current form as a women ’s magazine in the 1960s , becoming increasingly more sexual in content			2
the piece features information on exotic sounding positions such as the ' kinky jockey ' , the ' tawdry tire - swing ' , the ' erotic maypole ' and the ' sexy spider ' now a champion of sexual liberation for women , with the idea that women should enjoy sex without any guilt placed on them by societal prejudices , the magazine runs articles on numerous ways women can maximise their pleasure in bed as well as please their man			1
former editor of @entity76 and @entity77 sex columnist @entity75 says : ' there 's no greater mirror of contemporary sexual mores than @entity1			2
when erotic fashions evolve , @entity1 reflects those changes , so there 's no doubt the mag 's publication of a lesbian sex guide is significant			1
' it demonstrates far greater acceptance of same sex relationships and of experimentation by women who feel their sexuality is fluid			0
and it must come as a huge relief to all the @entity1 writers who have exhausted every single thing you can possibly say about blow - jobs and the reverse cowboy			0
' good cop , naughty cop : this position is essentially the same as ' doggy style ' , but involving either the use of a strap - on sex toy , or manual stimulation while the lower partner has their hands handcuffed behind their back			0
the passionate pole dancer : one partner sits on a chair , with the other partner supported in their lap , facing away from them			0
raising a knee helps keep things stable as well as providing stimulation for their clitoris			0
the kinky jockey : one partner kneels on all four and the other sits on them , using their tailbone as clitoral stimulation while yanking their hair like reins			2
defying gravity : one partner sits normal in a chair while the other kneels on her , facing out , and drops down to the floor , using their hands to balance			0
this provides an ideal position for oral sex .			0
