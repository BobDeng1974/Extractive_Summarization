by @entity0 women who receive better pain relief during labour are less likely to suffer postnatal depression controlling pain during childbirth may reduce the risk of mothers suffering from post-natal depression			1
researchers found women who had an epidural during labour had a 14 per cent rate of depression six weeks after birth			1
but this rose to 35 per cent for those who did not have the pain relief			2
in the study an epidural was the only means of pain control available to the women			1
the @entity25 research also found that breastfeeding was more common in the group who had an epidural for pain compared to those who did not , 70 per cent compared to 50 per cent			1
dr @entity32 , a perinatal psychiatrist at @entity33 in the @entity34 , wrote a report on the research conducted by the @entity25 researchers			2
she said : ' pain control gets the mother off to a good beginning rather than starting off defeated and exhausted			1
' whether it ’s vaginal or caesarean section delivery , pain control [ during and after the birth ] is an issue for all new mothers			1
' there is no way to have a delivery without pain			0
the objective here is to avoid severe pain			0
' controlling that delivery pain so a woman can comfortably develop as a mother is something that makes a lot of sense			0
' she added the study ’s findings , published in the journal @entity63 , are among the few to examine the relationship between pain during labor and postpartum depression			0
' it ’s a huge omission that there has been almost nothing in past research about pain during labour and delivery and postpartum depression			2
' there is a well - known relationship between acute and chronic pain and depression			2
' the incidence of severe acute postnatal pain is approximately 11 per cent for new mothers			0
the research discovered that biological and emotional factors contribute to postpartum depression , which affects 14.5 per cent of women who give birth			1
dr @entity32 added : ' these findings are quite exciting and further research should be done to confirm them , especially in women at increased risk of depression and in women from other cultures			0
' she recommends a woman who has chronic pain one to two months after delivery should be screened for depression			0
and that managing pain after childbirth supports a new mother ’s ability to emotionally attach and care for her baby			0
women who had an epidural during labour had a 14 per cent rate of depression six weeks after birth - but this rose to 35 per cent for those who did not have the pain relief			1

women who had epidural had a 14 **%** rate of depression 6 weeks after birth
@entity25 research found this rose to 35 **%** in women who did *n't* have it
' pain control gets the mother off to a good start - rather feeling exhausted '
