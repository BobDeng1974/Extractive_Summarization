it may seem hard to believe that such an unusual looking animal has remained hidden for so long			0
but scientists have only just discovered a new species of elephant shrew – or round - eared sengi - in the remote deserts of south western @entity7			1
while it is the smallest known member of the 19 sengis in the order @entity12 , the small creature is in fact genetically more closely related to an elephant than a true shrew			0
cute : scientists have discovered a new species of elephant shrew - or round - eared sengi ( pictured ) - in the remote deserts of south western @entity7 the @entity21 round - eared sengi , or @entity22 , was found in a remote part of the @entity24 in south western @entity7			1
it is the smallest of all elephant shrews or sengis			2
the animal is the third new species of sengi to be discovered in a decade			2
it has rust - coloured fur , a large , hairless gland on the underside of its tail and lacks dark skin pigment			1
genetic analysis showed important differences between this specimen and close relatives			0
sengis are restricted to @entity7 and despite their small size , are more closely related to elephants , manatees ( known as sea cows ) and aardvarks than they are to true shrews			0
the @entity21 round - eared sengi , or @entity22 , was discovered by scientists from the @entity50			1
it is the third new species of elephant shrew to be found in the wild in the past decade			1
the diminutive animal is smaller than other sengi and has rust - coloured fur , a large , hairless gland on the underside of its tail and lacks dark skin pigment , according to the study published in the @entity60			1
its unusual appearance attracted the attention of experts @entity65 and @entity66 , who noted it looked different from any museum specimens they had encountered			0
elusive : the @entity72 round - eared sengi , or @entity73 ( pictured ) was discovered by scientists from the @entity50			1
it is the third new species of sengi to be found in the wild in the past decade mapped : found in a remote area of @entity79 , on the inland edge of the @entity81 ( mapped ) at the base of the @entity83 , scientists believe this new species went undescribed for so long because of the challenges of doing scientific research in such an isolated area genetic analysis showed important differences between this specimen and close relatives			1
together with experts from the @entity94 of @entity79 and the @entity95 , they scoured museums for similar animals and conducted more genetic tests , before confirming that they had found a new species			0
‘ the differences between this and all other known species are very subtle , ’ said dr @entity65			0
‘ genetically , @entity22 is very different from other members of the genus and it ’s exciting to think that there are still areas of the world where even the mammal fauna is unknown and waiting to be explored			0
’ elephant shrews are restricted to @entity7 and despite their small size , are more closely related to elephants , manatees ( known as sea cows ) and aardvarks than they are to true shrews			2
nimble : the diminutive animal is smaller than other sengi and has rust - coloured fur , a large , hairless gland on the underside of its tail and lacks dark skin pigment found in a remote area of @entity79 , on the inland edge of the @entity81 at the base of the @entity83 , scientists believe this new species went undescribed for so long because of the challenges of doing scientific research in such an isolated area			1
yet it is precisely this isolation and the unique environmental conditions in the region that have given rise to this and other endemic animals			0
‘ with only about a dozen new species of mammal discovered in the wild each year , it is amazing that the @entity50 has been involved in describing three new sengis in the last decade , ’ said dr @entity142			2
‘ there are new and exciting insights into biodiversity awaiting discovery , even in a group as familiar as mammals			0

scientists from the @entity50 discovered @entity73 in the remote deserts of @entity79 , south western @entity7
it *'s* the third new species of sengi - or elephant shrew - to be found in the wild in the past decade
creature has rust - coloured fur and is smaller than other elephant shrews
scientists *compared* it to other elephant shrews and analysed its genetics to confirm it is a completely new species
