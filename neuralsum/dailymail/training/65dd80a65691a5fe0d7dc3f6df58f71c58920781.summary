in 2012 , 11 - year - old @entity51 was so petrified of getting on a plane home from the @entity54 that his parents looked for jobs in the area rather than back home in @entity59			2
and the @entity61 footballer @entity60 disappointed @entity63 fans hoping he would take a coaching role at the club as he revealed in his autobiography he will never fly again			0

after flying her mother out to calm her down , she eventually agreed to get on a ferry to @entity75 before taking the @entity76 to @entity77			1

‘ this was just a blight on the whole thing			0
we missed out on work for a month and we were draining our bank balances			2
’ the dog groomer said she had never suffered a panic attack before taking the outbound flight on july 16			1
it escalated , leaving her hyperventilating and being sick throughout the two - and - a - half hour journey			1
after making it to the hotel , she was given tablets by a @entity12 doctor but lost her nerve again on july 23 as they prepared to leave			2
she said : ‘ i completely freaked out			0
' i was n’t breathing very well and i kept passing out			0
' when we told the holiday reps , they read us a disclaimer saying if we did n’t get on the coach to the airport then we were no longer their responsibility			0
’ the couple returned to the hotel but had to pay £ 104 a night for their room – far more than during their package break , which cost a total of £ 1,600			1
they searched for another way home and found a ferry crossing a week later from @entity126 to @entity75			1
but moments before boarding , miss @entity28 had another panic attack and refused the £ 160 trip			1
her mother @entity132 , 56 , who also suffers from panic attacks , was flown out to calm her down			2
on august 15 , miss @entity28 was finally coaxed on to the ferry			0
it took them to @entity137 , where they boarded a £ 250 train to @entity140 before taking the @entity76 to @entity141 , @entity82			1
miss @entity28 said : ‘ in total we must have spent an extra £ 5,000			0
the only saving grace was the hotel staff			0
