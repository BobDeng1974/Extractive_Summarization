@entity0 is something we are all guilty of at @entity3			2
but did you know there are around 6,000 calories lurking in the average @entity3 feast , putting us at risk of gaining almost half a stone by the @entity11			1
from potatoes roasted in goose fat to celebratory glasses of champagne , it is easy to pack in almost three times your recommended daily allowance in one sitting			1
and dietitian @entity20 warns just a few canapes before dinner can add 2,000 calories - equal to a woman 's daily recommended allowance - to the festive feast tally			1
while the temptation can be too much for many , this infographic , produced by @entity27 , offers a host of top tips to surviving the festive period - your waistline unscathed			1
with the average person consuming a staggering 6,000 calories on christmas day , there are a host of tips to help you prepare a lighter festive feast that is kinder to your waistline from removing the skin of the turkey , to cutting potatoes slightly bigger , and opting for a dark chocolate , it is possible to enjoy a lighter @entity3 without missing out			1
mrs @entity20 told @entity43 : ' the average @entity3 dinner has 6,000 calories			1
' when you consider a woman 's daily recommended allowance is 2,000 and a man 's is 2,500 , that equates to almost three times your daily amounts			1
' the more vegetables on your plate , the less room there is for fatty foods , and they can help fill you up for longer			2
' meanwhile @entity58 , dr @entity59 , warned the festive period can be particularly hazardous for those with health condition , including diabetes and high cholesterol and blood pressure			2
moderation , they agree , is key with portion control at the very heart of a healthier @entity3			2
the hidden calories in @entity70 and the worst offenders on the @entity3 menu ? canapes , said mrs @entity20			1
sausage rolls , pigs in blankets , mini tartlets packed with tasty fillings - just a handful of bite - sized appetisers before @entity3 dinner can add a staggering 2,000 calories to your festive tally			1
' they are so moreish , and we know when our taste buds are overstimulated we are more likely to over indulge , ' she said			0
' and often they are eaten before a main meal , meaning you could consume your recommended daily allowance of calories before @entity3 dinner			1
' that is why it is so important to have a really good breakfast , or if you are off to a party a good bowl of soup or cereal to fill you up			0
' ' it is all about moderation			0
in the past @entity3 used to be about one day , then you had @entity100			2
' but now it is an entire festive period , it is almost a four - week run up beforehand			2
skimming the fat from the top of the gravy and homemade cranberry sauce can combat high fat and sugar levels , helping to reduce calories ' if you overeat by 500 calories a day , which is very easy to do , you will start to see your weight increase quickly			1
source : @entity27 and @entity20 ' a handful of crisps , a glass or two of champagne and it is easy to add 500 calories without realising			1
' it is easy when you go to so many parties			0
' the key is not to totally abandon your healthy eating principles			0
there are a number of clever swaps you can make to make a big difference			0
' @entity127 swaps to keep the @entity128 choosing marinated chicken instead of breaded or deep fried , a handful of @entity132 rather than crisps and rationing the number of nuts you gorge on , can all help			1
white turkey meat has lower levels of fat than dark meat , and banishing the skin can cut calories			1
and when it comes to roast potatoes , cutting each serving slightly larger than normal helps to decrease the surface area absorbing the fat , helping to shave yet more calories from the festive feast			1
' they may be small changes , just 50 calories here and there , but they all add up , ' mrs @entity20 added			2
' five hundred extra calories a day puts on around 1lb a week , which by the end of the festive period could see a person gaining almost half a stone			1
' beat the @entity157 and if , like thousands of people you suffer irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity161 ) , you might have the perfect excuse to avoid the dreaded @entity164 sprouts			0
while full fibre , vitamin c and carotenoids , which boost eye health , they are also packed with raffinose			0
@entity171 can not be broken down by the stomach and bypasses the small intestines , travelling straight to the large intestine and colon where bacteria ' have a field day ' , producing methane gases and triggering bloating			2
and on top of all that food , mrs @entity20 said it is vital to remember the calories you will drink each day , toasting the occasion			1
dietitian @entity20 warned @entity164 sprouts contain high levels of raffinose , which can not be digested by the stomach and so can cause bloating ' alcohol is so calorific , a glass of champagne is around 89 calories , ' she said			2
' and often people top up their glasses without realising how many they are having			0
' and once you have had one glass too many , you lose your inhibitions and are more likely to overeat			0
' maybe choose a smaller glass of wine , drink it from a champagne flute , to cut down			1
' ' that is not to say you have to be party poopers on christmas day , ' she added			1
' but for many by @entity11 they can gain as much as 5lbs , which is so much harder to lose than it is to gain			0
' opt for a fruit or veggie stuffing over sausage meat , and skimmed or one per cent milk to make bread sauce , rather than cream or whole milk			1
' and be aware of your butter intake , at @entity3 it is all about brandy butter			1
but a teapsoon of butter , around 5g , can pack in as many as 45 calories			1
' instead , maybe use lemon juice and if you are craving a mince pie , choose a smaller one			1
count your chocolate wrappers to avoid temptation ' another popular treat is @entity3 chocolates , tubs of celebrations and @entity234 adorning tables			0
' my tip is to keep hold of your wrappers to track how many you are eating , it is easy to dismiss them because they are small			0
' as well as clever food swaps , portion control and a little restraint , exercise can help you beat the january weight gain blues			0
' @entity3 is a time where many people sit down with their families , ' she said			0
' all exercise habits can go out the window			0
swapping white and milk chocolate for dark alternatives can help shave calories from your festive tally ' but a brisk walk on @entity3 can counteract some of the indulgence			1
' ' it all comes down to portion control , ' she said			0
' restraint and balancing your food for a more comfortable , less bloated @entity3 and an easier @entity11			0
' one in five people suffer @entity161 and @entity3 often triggers the symptoms , especially with the stressful build - up beforehand			2
' @entity270 can leave a person feeling bloated and uncomfortable , so it is better to exercise a little restraint and opt for smaller portions of everything , without depriving yourself			1
' treat it like a normal day , enjoy it but do n't over do it			2
' dr @entity59 echoed the calls for restraint , highlighting the importance for those with existing health conditions			0
she told @entity43 : ' it is particularly important for people with health conditions , such as high cholesterol and diabetes , to take care over the @entity3 period			0
' it is important to recognise you are eating a larger than normal meal , full of sugar , fat and carbohydrates , and so sugar levels in particular , may be affected			2
' but it is not just one meal , it is the @entity3 period			0
' for type 1 diabetics they might need to be aware their insulin requirements are likely to go up over the festive period			0
' it is about achieving a balance			0
a simple rule to follow is to fill half your plate with vegetables , a quarter with carbohydrates and the last quarter with lean meat			2
' enjoy it but remember it is not a normal meal , you are going to be indulging a lot more than usual			0
' consider that and eat in moderation and try to balance your meals as much as possible			0
' choosing vegetable oil instead of goose fat , watching salt levels and enjoying a hearty breakfast can help			0
