three weeks before @entity3 died , aged just 36 , she and her twin brother , @entity2 star @entity1 , went for a walk in the @entity6 village where they grew up			1
‘ it was a beautiful day , ’ remembers the actor , who shot to fame in the 1990s playing long - haired hunk @entity10 in @entity12 ’s @entity11 , and recently appeared in the box office hit @entity14			1
‘ we had a cream tea and then wandered up to the 11th century church			0
’ as early summer sunlight dappled through the trees on to the ancient graves , @entity1 idly asked @entity22 where she ’d like to be buried			1
he recalls : ‘ she said in her slightly dismissive way , “ oh , i do n’t know			0
maybe there , ” and pointed to a damp and shady corner of the churchyard			2
’ @entity1 asked @entity22 if she would n’t want somewhere more picturesque to rest but , having made her choice , she seemed adamant			1
@entity22 was a lifelong sufferer from the neurological condition epilepsy , but , before she died , appeared to have turned a corner in her treatment			1
then she suffered a catastrophic seizure during a day out at the beach			2
three days later , on june 6 , 2010 , she passed away from multiple organ failure			2
and so @entity22 was laid to rest in the spot she had chosen , quite befitting the unconventional life she had chosen , living with her carpenter husband @entity56 in a gypsy wagon , and breeding pheasants for a living			0
epilepsy , which affects about one per cent of the population , is due to damage to the tissues of the brain which causes disruption in communication between nerve cells			2
this can occur through head injury , stroke , meningitis and genetic conditions , or birth trauma – which is rare , but perhaps was a factor in @entity22 ’s case			0
@entity1 and his sister came from a large family of eight children including , remarkably , three sets of twins			1
when she was born , @entity22 spent four weeks in hospital			2
‘ she turned blue just after birth , ’ explains @entity1			1
soap star : @entity1 , who is now 40 , played heart - throb @entity10 in @entity11 from 1993 to 1995 people with epilepsy have a tendency to recurrent seizures and the type and severity depends on the part of the brain damaged			1
alongside drugs known as anti-convulsants , management of the condition involves a healthy lifestyle that includes regular sleeping patterns			0
in some cases , surgery can help			0
@entity1 says : ‘ as a family we are unconvinced by mainstream medicine for the most part , and relied predominantly on nurturing her ourselves			1
she rejected most anti-convulsants because of the side effects			0
’ dr @entity109 , consultant neurologist at @entity111 and @entity112 , and @entity113 in @entity111 , says : ‘ @entity114 have long been the mainstay of treatment for epilepsy no matter what form it takes			1
this is in part because of the very small risk of death when the seizure is prolonged or sudden unexpected death in epilepsy			1
but it can be hard for younger patients to commit to a drug which they need to take for long periods or even the rest of their lives			0
’ while they were growing up , the @entity130 lived a bohemian existence in @entity6 , with all the children home - schooled			2
@entity22 had her first seizure aged nine			2
@entity1 says : ‘ doctors felt being at home was the best thing for her , with a twin growing at the same chronological rate and able to support her			1
there were differences between us academically which became more pronounced as we grew up , ’ @entity1 continues			1
‘ i was looking to go to @entity112			0
@entity22 led a normal life apart from the odd seizure , and she stayed locally			2
’ @entity1 joined the cast of @entity11 aged 19 and then , as his film career took off in his 20s , divided his time between @entity152 and @entity153			1
@entity22 became his solace from the ‘ madness ’ of showbiz			0
red carpet : @entity1 ( right ) with @entity14 co-stars @entity158 and @entity159 at the premiere last year in her 20s , unable to drive because of her seizures ( the @entity161 requires patients to be seizure free for a year to hold a licence ) , @entity22 began taking medication and for a decade , this worked			1
then her symptoms returned with a vengeance			0
seizures typically last just a few moments but in severe cases , they can occur in quick succession , or continuously – and any episode that lasts for more than five minutes requires urgent treatment as there is a risk of brain damage			1
@entity22 ’s fits were lasting 30 minutes or more			0
‘ such seizures are often triggered by something , ’ says professor @entity182 , director of the @entity183 , professor of neurology and @entity185 and @entity186 at @entity187			0
perhaps an infection or forgetting medication			0
but sometimes they just happen without explanation			0
’ in @entity22 ’s case , no one will ever know why , on a hot may day at @entity197 beach near @entity198 with her husband , she suffered a two - hour seizure			1
an ambulance took her to intensive care , where her family were called to her bedside			0
throughout our conversation @entity1 is introspective , speaking about the idea that when one twin dies and the other survives there is a ‘ connection between @entity213 ’ , and that seeing a bird trapped in the eaves of a church ‘ felt like a symbol ’			1
but , perhaps like his sister did when choosing her memorial , he also sees humour even in the bleakest moments			2
and he speaks of the dreadful time with gentle humour : ‘ the day after she died , my agent called , oblivious to what was going on , and said , “ we ’ve got this great audition			0
it ’s for a film called @entity230 … ” ’			0
