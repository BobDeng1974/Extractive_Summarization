@entity0 has confirmed it is placing clickable warnings over extreme ' graphic ' content on its site			1
the warnings , which are placed over flagged images and videos , state that the content might ' shock offend and upset '			1
the move comes after the @entity12 social media site came under fire for failing to impose greater controls on disturbing images			0
@entity0 has confirmed it is placing warnings over extreme ' graphic ' content on its @entity19 warnings , which are placed over flagged images and videos , state that the content might ' shock offend and upset ' the warning asks the user ' are you sure you want to see this ? '			1
content with the warning will not be seen by users under 18 and videos will also not autoplay like other newsfeed items			1
videos to come under the new measures include footage of the death of @entity38 policeman , @entity37 , who was shot in @entity39 during the @entity41 attacks			1
' a photo or video containing graphic content may appear with a warning to let people know about the content before they view it , and may only be visible to people older than 18 , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity0 has confirmed the scheme has been rolled out on its site since december			2
' when people share things on @entity0 , we expect that they will share it responsibly , including choosing who will see that content , ' a spokeswoman told the @entity57			1
videos to come under the new measures include footage of the death of @entity38 policeman @entity37 , who was shot in @entity39 during the @entity41 attacks ' we also ask that people warn their audience about what they are about to see if it includes graphic violence			1
' as well as changes to graphic content warnings , @entity0 said today said it will begin firing off police - sanctioned ' @entity67 ' to members of the leading social network to help locate children who have been abducted or gone missing			1
alerts including pictures and details about missing children and their possible abductors will appear in news feeds of @entity0 members in areas where those being sought might be found , according to the social network 's trust and safety manager @entity81			2
@entity0 members sharing the news will be able to link to relevant information at the website of the @entity88 , which issues @entity89 at the behest of police the @entity92 warning system was started after the 1996 kidnapping and murder of 9 - year - old @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity97			1
since then , more than 700 children have been found as a direct result of the alerts			0

dr @entity109 , who runs a branch of the @entity112 suicide - prevention charity , is calling for an outright ban on graphic clips			1
he told the @entity57 that many children used the service and they could work around the new restrictions			0
currently , @entity0 only allows children 13 years or older to be members			2

the site has long faced criticism for what has been described as an ' overly complex ' response to disturbing content			0
its policy states it would ban any content ' shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence '			2
in 2013 , it placed warnings over clips of beheadings , but the scheme was not rolled out across the entire site			0

they had accused @entity0 of irresponsibility after it lifted a ban on users posting videos of beheadings - and demanded the social networking site explain its decision to parents			1
critics accused the firm of ' taking leave of its senses '			0
@entity0 said at the time that while the images must not be posted for ' sadistic pleasure ' they should be available for those who wish to condemn them			2
currently , @entity0 only allows children 13 years or older to be members , but many can get around this rule			0
