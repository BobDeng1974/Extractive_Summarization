@entity8 , the prime suspect in the murky case which has seen prime minister @entity11 demand answers , is said to have terrified those around her and behaved like ' an empress '			1
her husband @entity14 , 60 , rose up the ranks of the @entity16 with an incredibly successful anti-corruption , sweeping gangs from the streets and reducing levels of crime			0
but his wife , 50 , was an equally strong figure as details of a confrontation at the @entity26 - where @entity6 , 41 , was poisoned last november - would appear to confirm			1
@entity8 , furious when a waiter 's pleas to noisy diners to quieten down went unheeded , called the local police chief , @entity30 , a close ally of her husband , and summoned him into action			1
a source close to @entity35 officials explained how , minutes later , he stormed into the restaurant at the hilltop hotel , brandishing his pistol and threatening the rowdy eaters			1

she is one of the 39 people have now been arrested in a series of raids over several months on officials linked to politician @entity14 – once tipped as a future @entity16 leader			1
those arrested are believed to include billionaire @entity91 , one of @entity4 ’s richest men			1
police believe he was poisoned after he threatened to expose a plan by @entity8 to move millions of dollars abroad			1
of the various unproven claims to have emerged in the case , it has been suggested that @entity6 was helping to launder that money - and even that he was having an affair with @entity8			1
@entity8 and @entity30 are in custody and @entity14 has not been seen in public since march , when he was dismissed as boss of @entity35			2

questions remain : it is thought that mr @entity6 was killed in one of the mountain - top hotel 's £ 600 - a - night villas , but details of his demise are sketchy according to @entity120 's account in a @entity4 newspaper , @entity30 had a flair for the dramatic			1
he would drive to crime scenes in a @entity137 jeep modified to carry a double rack of lights on its roof so the locals would know ‘ @entity30 ’ was on the case			0
he would leap atop the car , draw his gun and fire shots in the air after arriving on the scene			2
on a night raid of hair salons thought to be fronts for prostitution , @entity30 rushed into one and threw a young man with dyed yellow hair to the ground			0
after a police search for evidence yielded nothing , he told them to take the youth to the police station , saying , ‘ a man with hair like that ca n't be any good			2
’ @entity14 brought in @entity30 to lead a crackdown on organised crime in @entity35 after he became the city 's @entity16 chief in 2007			2
the two men became close , said a source in @entity35 with access to city officials			2
‘ the anti-organised crime campaign was like a two - man skit , ’ said the source			2

he also demanded continuous supplies of fresh flowers and towels , said another source with access to city officials			0
a former colleague of @entity30 's in northeast @entity4 said he would sometimes perform the autopsies on executed convicts himself because he claimed he wanted to see if ‘ their hearts were black or red ’			1
as @entity30 's crime crackdown grew , the campaign created enemies in the rank and file , as well as in leadership circles			0
