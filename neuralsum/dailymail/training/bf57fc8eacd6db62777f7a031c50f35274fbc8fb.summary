by @entity0 published : 14:43 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 16:43 est , 10 september 2013 @entity1 has spoken out about @entity3 's rocky departure from the @entity4 saying that he purposefully tried to keep quiet in the aftermath even though many saw him as the reason for her departure			1
the anchor said that while he was ' disappointed ' by the way the ousting of @entity3 was handled publicly , he knew that there was nothing he could do			1
' does anyone want to see a person who ’s making the money that the newspapers say i ’m making complaining , “ @entity14 is me , my life is terrible , and people are being unfair ” ? no one would ’ve had any patience for that			2
i would n’t have any patience for that , ' he told @entity28			0
tense : @entity1 said that he was ' incredibly frustrated ' over the past two years since he was largely blamed for the forced departure of his co-anchor @entity3 that was the only time he mentioned the anchoring upheaval specifically , though there were two other very clear digs at his former colleague			1
in one , he said that if he were to offer up - and - coming broadcasters his career , they would all take it in a heartbeat			2
the interesting part of the anecdote came in the way that he described the offer , and in turn , his time at @entity47			0
he told the hypothetical newcomers : ' you ’re going to have twenty years as host of the today show , and eighteen of those years are going to be so unbelievably fantastic that you ’re going to think you ’re living in a fantasy world			2
and one or two of those years is going to be incredibly frustrating and challenging '			2
there was no mention of his current co-anchor , @entity58 , but he did circle back to @entity60 , who was at the couch beside him in the 1990s through to 2006			1
the replacement : @entity58 came in to take over for @entity3 in june 2011 connection : @entity1 said that his relationship with @entity60 was more than just ' chemistry ' , it was a bond that came from covering stories like the attacks of september 11 , 2001 ' there ’s a difference between good chemistry and a bond			1
chemistry is something you have with somebody you meet — or you do n’t			0
it ’s much harder to put your finger on than a bond			0
broadcasting through 9/11 together , like @entity60 and i did , creates a bond , ' he said			0
the interview , which came more in the form of a series of espoused wisdom than an article , included the 55 - year - old 's reflections on his father and mother , but most saccharine moment came when he spoke about his children			1
' if i feel like i ’ve done a great job during an interview with the president of the @entity103 live in the @entity104 , it does n’t give me a tenth of the good feeling of going to the school play and making eye contact with my kids as they ’re onstage delivering their lines			0
nothing compares with that moment of connection , ' he said			0
doting : @entity1 said that no interview is as good as a shared connection with his children - seen holding his daughter @entity118 ( he also has two sons named @entity120 and @entity121 who are not pictured ) ever since @entity3 made her weepy departure from the @entity4 in june 2011 , and @entity1 has tried to remain tight - lipped throughout it all			1
he gave one interview to @entity125 in march where he said that he had not spoken to @entity3 since his departure because his mind was elsewhere			1
' because i ’m concentrating on doing the show , not concentrating on spinning the damage and trying to end the negativity on a daily basis , ' he told the magazine .			0

@entity1 's former co-anchor @entity3 was fired in june 2011 and many placed the blame on @entity1
she made a tear - filled exit *shortly* before @entity58 replaced her
he has largely *refused* to comment on the issue in the past two years
