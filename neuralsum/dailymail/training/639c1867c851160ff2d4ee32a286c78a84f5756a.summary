by @entity0 published : 08:42 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 09:32 est , 17 may 2012 disgraced : @entity1 , former chief constable of @entity2 , is to get the payout despite admitting ' gross misconduct ' a disgraced former chief constable who admitted gross misconduct for helping a relative get a job has walked away from the force with a £ 250,000 golden goodbye , it emerged yesterday			1
@entity1 , 51 , narrowly escaped the sack over the claims of nepotism and was given a final written warning at a secret disciplinary hearing last may			1
but after the police authority refused to extend his £ 133,000 - a - year contract a controversial clause legally entitling mr @entity1 to £ 247,636 in compensation was activated			1
the clause enables mr @entity1 to receive 85 per cent of the difference between the pension lump sum he is now eligible for after serving 28 - and - a - half years and the amount he would have received had he continued for another 18 months			2
it is believed to be the first time the compensation clause has ever been activated following a decision not to renew a chief constable 's contract			2
today , the payment to the former @entity32 police chief was branded ' shocking ' and ' ridiculous '			1
@entity33 and @entity35 mp @entity34 urged the government to overhaul the rules which entitled mr @entity1 to the large pay - out			0
' the taxpayers of @entity32 will find this figure shocking , ' he said			2
' i have already written to the policing minister and i am meeting with him to make the case that never again will a chief officer guilty of gross misconduct be able to take these ridiculous sums of money			1
' mr @entity1 admitted making ' errors of judgement ' when he helped a family member jump the queue to apply for a job within his own force in february 2010			1
he stepped in after a hotline set up to recruit 70 new officers was ' overwhelmed ' by 500,000 applicants , many of whom were unable to get through			1
former office : the headquarters of @entity2 in @entity61 among them was a male member of mr @entity1 's extended family			2
the relative was not entitled to a ' call back ' , but nonetheless mr @entity1 rang the family member himself and completed the vetting questionnaire			1
mr @entity1 later admitted his involvement and in a meeting with the force solicitor allegedly described himself as an ' a * * * hole '			0
despite his apparent admission mr @entity1 continued to deny helping the relative and only admitted the charge of gross misconduct - a sackable offence - when his disciplinary hearing got underway			1
by then more than £ 300,000 of public money had been spent on the misconduct case			0
mr @entity1 did not respond to calls from this newspaper for a comment			0
but the existence of the clause that entitled him to the pay - out is likely to come into sharper focus when the newly - elected police commissioners take over from police authorities at the end of the year			1
under new rules commissioners will be given the power to remove chief constables from office			0
as a result there could be more pay - outs similar to the one mr @entity1 received			0
last night , @entity98 chief executive @entity97 said : ' it is important that the public understand that the @entity98 had absolutely no discretion in this matter whatsoever			0
' mr @entity1 became entitled to receive this payment as a matter of law , following the @entity98 's decision not to extend his fixed term appointment			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity109 said : ' police authorities signed up to these arrangements several years ago but we are looking at them again in the light of the recent @entity114			0
' ' it recommended that misconduct hearings should have the power to remove all or part of a chief constable 's severance payment and we have asked the @entity121 to consider this			0
' mr @entity1 has been succeeded by temporary chief constable @entity123			0
the police authority said mr @entity123 's temporary appointment was to allow the @entity126 , due to be elected in november , to make the final decision on a substantive appointment .			2

@entity130 *awarded* sum due to *special* clause after @entity32 police refused to renew contract
disciplinary hearing heard he helped a family member jump queue of 500,000 applicants for jobs
the 51 - year - old later admitted ' gross misconduct '
