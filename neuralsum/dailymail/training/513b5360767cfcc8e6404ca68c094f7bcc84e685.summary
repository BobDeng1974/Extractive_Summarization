by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:47 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 20:55 est , 5 december 2012 a £ 1billion raid on pensions will hit tens of thousands of middle and high - income earners , experts warned last night			1
@entity7 yesterday announced he was cutting the tax - free amount an individual can put into their pension each year from £ 50,000 to £ 40,000			1
it comes just a year after the annual limit was cut from £ 255,000			1
@entity15 statement : chancellor @entity7 delivers his @entity15 budget in the @entity17 and cut the tax relief for rich pensioners the tax - free cap on lifetime pension pots will also be reduced from £ 1.5million to £ 1.25million			1
the chancellor suggested the changes would largely affect only those at the very top of the income scale			0
but experts warned that many middle income earners could be affected if they are in final salary pension schemes			2
however the main impact will be on those earning higher incomes , particularly in the public sector			0
sources suggested the change could affect the top five per cent of public sector earners – including senior civil servants , top doctors , leading police officers and head teachers			0
off to work : @entity7 and @entity41 leave the chancellor 's home on @entity44 day - and are set to hit @entity45 's richest the @entity46 said 160,000 a year would be caught by the decision to cap annual tax relief at £ 40,000			1
some 340,000 workers will be affected by the lifetime allowance to £ 1.25 million			1
the pensions raid was drawn up as an alternative to the @entity53 ’ mansion tax on homes worth more than £ 2million			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ i know these tax measures will not be welcomed by all – ways to reduce the deficit never are			0
but we must show we ’re all in this together			0
’ @entity60 , chief executive of the @entity61 , said many on middle incomes could be hit with tax bills running into thousands of pounds if they got a significant promotion			2
she added : ‘ the chancellor is wrong to say that the changes will only affect those at the top of the wage tree			0
complaint : @entity7 and @entity41 leave the @entity72 on @entity73 yesterday but their decision to cut tax benefits for pensions have been panned by some ‘ @entity7 claims he is taking a carrot away from the rich , but he is also beating many middle class savers with a stick			1
middle managers in the public and private sectors will get caught in the net			0
‘ people in a final salary pension who have worked loyally for the same employer for years and then get a pay rise , or a promotion , could end up with a tax bill of several thousand pounds			1
’ the self - employed and those nearing retirement desperately trying to ‘ catch up ’ by boosting their pension are also at risk			2
‘ what we desperately need is stability , so that people can trust the pensions system and get on with saving for their old age , instead of being treated like a cashpoint when things go wrong , ’ she said			0
doing the maths : @entity7 on his visit to @entity107 ahead of his mini-budget but @entity109 , director - general of @entity110 , said it was reasonable to trim the pension tax allowances of the better - off			1
‘ it is understandable that the chancellor has chosen to limit the amount spent on top earners ’ pensions tax relief , ’ she said			1
‘ tax relief is meant to be an incentive to help people save for retirement , but it is hugely expensive and it provides the most incentive to the people who need it least			0
the highest earners get the highest incentives			0
’ mr @entity7 said the average pension saver put in £ 6,000 a year , with just one per cent putting away more than £ 40,000			1
an individual saving for a defined contribution scheme in the private sector would have to be earning well over £ 200,000 to be affected			0
successful small business owners , workers with generous final salary schemes and the very wealthiest will be hit by the raid on pensions			2
they will either be caught out by a lower cap on how much tax relief they can get on their pension contributions , or by a limit on the amount they can save up in a retirement fund			2
yesterday , @entity7 announced the annual tax allowance for pension contributions will be cut from £ 50,000 to £ 40,000 from 2014			1
the lifetime limit will be lowered from £ 1.5million to £ 1.25million			2
for the vast majority , paying these sorts of sums into a pension pot is unimaginable			0
a 30 - year - old , getting healthy annual pay rises and benefiting from a good return on his or her investment , would have to pay in 40p of every £ 1 earned every year for 35 years to get close to the £ 1.25million limit , according to insurers @entity161			1
even someone in a very generous final salary scheme , with 40 years ’ continuous service , who retired on £ 97,500 a year , would only just bust the cap			2
the government estimates that just 30,000 people would have more than £ 1.25million in their pension pots in 2014			2
but around 330,000 of current working age could be affected in the future			0
these are all likely to be senior staff in companies or the public sector , with good final salary schemes to which they have contributed for years			0
it is the annual allowance which will catch out more workers			0
typically , small business owners do n’t pay into a pension during their working years , instead preferring to make a large lump sum when they sell their company			0
head teachers , police chiefs , senior nurses , middle - ranking civil servants and private sector managers on around £ 50,000 , who are in final salary schemes and get a 10 per cent pay rise could also bust the cap and face a tax charge on the excess			1
the raid on pensions may be morally acceptable but the chancellor must , once and for all , make up his mind how he wants to treat tax relief on pensions so workers know what to expect in retirement			1
the message that this government keeps reinforcing is that savers ’ nest eggs are fair game when it comes to getting the economy back on track			0
