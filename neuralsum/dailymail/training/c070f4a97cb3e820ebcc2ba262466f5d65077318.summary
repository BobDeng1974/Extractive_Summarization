by @entity1 reporter published : 15:38 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 17:57 est , 1 december 2012 students at @entity3 woke up on friday to find inflammatory invitations had been pushed under their bedroom doors			1
a sealed envelope contained a flyer inviting undergraduates to ' @entity3 ’s @entity9 ' - one of the university 's 14 exclusive single - sex social groups			0
this new organization claimed to be called the pigeon - two of the all - male clubs , the @entity15 and the @entity16 , are named after birds			0
it proclaimed a motto of ' inclusion , @entity21 , @entity22 '			0
but each word was footnoted			0
inclusion had ' @entity25 need not apply			0
' @entity21 was ' seriously , no f * * * * * * g @entity25			0
' @entity22 had ' @entity28 ' - a misspelling of the date - rape drug rohypnol			0
' offensive ' : the invitation that was distributed in all nine @entity33 in the early hours of friday the invitation claimed that the first meeting of the new club was at 11.02pm on december 13 at @entity37 , a frozen yoghurt shop , and ' semi-bro attire ' was required			1
the leaflets were distributed in nine dormitory houses			1
@entity3 @entity43 @entity42 reacted to the pamphlets by saying : ' i find these flyers offensive			1
they are not a reflection of the values of our community			0
' even if intended as satirical in nature , they are hurtful and offensive to many students , faculty and staff , and do not demonstrate the level of thoughtfulness and respect we expect at @entity3 when engaging difficult issues within our community			1
' no one has yet claimed responsibility for the incident but many at the university do believe that the flyers are satirical			2
@entity67 , one of the 9 dormitories where the leaflets were distributed			1
@entity71 created @entity72 in his @entity67 room in 2004 @entity3 final clubs are controversial on campus as some consider them to be elitist and discriminatory			1
as the @entity78 reported in 2011 , a similar under - the - door campaign ( also used by the real clubs ) asked students to think twice about joining a final club			1
that leaflet asked undergraduates to consider the ' exclusivity , ' gender discrimination , ' ' unequal access to social space on @entity3 ’s campus ' and ' lack of transparency ' of the clubs			2
concerns have also been raised about the safety of students at final clubs			2
in 2010 the @entity78 expressed concerns about sexual assault at the clubs : ' when predatory sexual behavior at @entity3 is discussed , the conversation often turns to the all - male final clubs , whose parties are known for their free - flowing alcohol and lack of administrative supervision			2

@entity43 describes stunt as ' offensive ' but many on campus believe pamphlets are satirical
