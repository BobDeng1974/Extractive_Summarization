by @entity0 published : 08:46 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 27 september 2013 @entity1 has sent its @entity3 trike around the @entity4 and added it to the online service			1
the search giant spent two weeks riding a special trike fitted with 360 degree cameras around the huge experiment to capture it			1
members of the public can now marvel at the sheer enormity of @entity13 as well as other giant machines at the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) near @entity16			1
members of the public can take in the 7000 - tonne @entity13 detector , which is probing for fundamental particles including the @entity20 , using @entity3 this view is of @entity22 , a heavy - ion detector on the @entity4 ring that 's designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities , where a phase of matter called quark - gluon plasma forms the @entity31 in @entity32 is opening an exhibition this november to show the work of some 10,000 people across the globe to uncover the building blocks of the universe at the @entity4 the museum will use theatre and video as well as real artefacts from @entity15 to recreate the famous laboratory			1
it promises to take visitors behind the scenes to witness the discovery of the @entity20 and explore the 27km collider			0
‘ we ’re delighted that @entity15 opened its doors to @entity3 allowing anyone , anywhere in the world to take a peek into its laboratories , control centers and its myriad underground tunnels housing cutting - edge experiments , ’ said @entity49 of @entity1			1
@entity15 is the world 's largest particle physics laboratory where some of the world ’s best physicists and engineers use advanced particle accelerators to help solve age old questions about the universe like what it 's made of and how it started			0
@entity1 has already sent its trikes , cars and backpacks everywhere from the @entity71 to the @entity72			0
it says the latest addition to @entity3 could even help scientists plan future experiments			1
this is a view of the @entity4 beauty ( @entity79 ) experiment , which will shed light on why we live in a universe that appears to be composed almost entirely of matter , but no antimatter			2
it was set up to explore what happened after the @entity87 the 27 - km @entity4 tunnel holding the circumference accelerator ring of superconducting magnets , is pictured			1
its job is to increase the energy of particles that will be smashed at detectors around the ring ‘ @entity3 also lets scientists working on the experiments , who may be on the other side of the world , explore the equipment they 're using			2
’ the @entity1 team were able to capture the main experiments running at @entity15 , the @entity107 particle physics laboratory based in the suburbs of @entity16			1
‘ a team from @entity1 , working with @entity15 personnel , took images across all of @entity15 ’s sites using , among other things , a bike - mounted camera system known as the “ @entity116 ”			2
@entity13 ( pictured ) is a particle physics experiment that is searching for new discoveries in the head - on collisions of protons of extraordinarily high energy			0
it aims to learn about forces that shaped our @entity124 since and that will determine its fate , including the dimensions of space and evidence of dark matter a year ago , the world 's largest particle collider identified what is believed to be the @entity20			0
but the experiment is now on a break as work is pushing ahead to give the vast machines an upgrade			0
the 27km circular lab went offline in february for an 18 - month overhaul			0
when experiments resume in 2015 , scientists at @entity15 will use its enhanced power to probe dark matter , dark energy and super symmetry			2
they also explored parts of the @entity4 tunnel and four experiments : @entity22 , @entity13 , @entity151 and @entity79 , ’ said @entity152 of @entity15			1
six - sided panoramic images were taken every three metres and four experiments were photographed , as well as 1200 metres of the @entity4 tunnel			1
the entire project generated 6,000 points that were coordinated with @entity158 locations to create a virtual tour of the laboratory			0
the project is ongoing and will expand and offer views of more of @entity15 experiments , @entity152 said			0
this view is of the @entity151 ( @entity151 ) , a general - purpose detector at the @entity4 that 's designed to investigate a wide range of physics , including the search for the @entity20 , extra dimensions and particles that could make up dark matter @entity151 is 25 metres long , 15 metres in diameter , and weighs about 12,500 tons			2
approximately 3,800 people from 42 countries built and now operate the detector			0
in july 2012 , along with @entity13 , @entity151 discovered a boson , which is very similar to the @entity176 @entity20			0
