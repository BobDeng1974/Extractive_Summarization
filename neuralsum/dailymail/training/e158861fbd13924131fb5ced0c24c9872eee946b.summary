up to 100,000 mormons from around the world will arrive in @entity2 this weekend to listen to words of guidance and inspiration from the faith 's leaders during a biannual church conference			1
thousands of the attendees will be coming from countries outside the @entity11 — most stopping on their way into the 21,000 - seat conference center to grab headphones so they can listen to speeches translated into 94 different languages			1
it is widely anticipated that one or more of this weekend 's speakers will deliver an address in a language other than @entity21 , marking a first in the @entity24 ' biannual general conference			2
members of the @entity27 singing during the opening session of a mormon church conference in @entity2 that happened in april this year church leaders recently announced they would make that option available to speakers			1
a non-english speech would be an important representation of the internationalization of a church that was founded in 1830 by @entity37 in @entity38 , say scholars who study the religion			0
' it 's a hugely important symbol , because it reveals that the religion is becoming less and less a small , interesting @entity44 sect , and more and more a diverse , global religion , ' said @entity46 , a @entity27 scholar and history professor at @entity48 in @entity49			0
the number of church members outside the @entity11 first surpassed the number within the country in 1997 , and today more than half of the faith 's 15 million members reside in non- @entity11 countries , said @entity58 , a church member who analyzes membership numbers with the nonprofit @entity60			1
the faith has established footing in several @entity44 countries that are rooted in @entity64 , including @entity65 and @entity66 , which both count more than 1 million church members			2
membership growth is driven by a missionary force of young men and women who proselytize around the world			0
the @entity73 ( pictured ) in @entity74 in @entity2 will host the conference this weekend the nearly 85,000 missionaries serving around the world are more than at any time in church history			1
but behind the glowing international membership numbers lays a real and challenging problem for the church — keeping new converts active in the faith , @entity58 said			0
his group 's analysis shows that foreign church members are significantly less active in church activities than @entity88 in the @entity11 many factors play into this , he said , with the most pertinent being a disconnect between missionaries who lured them to the faith and local church members tasked with keeping them active , he said			1
@entity96 , a professor of mormon history and culture at @entity99 , said retention of international members is a real challenge because the church tends to baptize converts quickly			0
that makes their commitment ' vulnerable and tender , ' @entity96 said			0
but hearing a general conference speech in their own language this weekend could be a special moment that will make international members feel more a part of the faith , @entity96 said			2
' it will reinforce the international spread of the church , but will also signal a deepened sensitivity and respect for those speakers and listeners who are not fluent in @entity21 , ' @entity96 said .			0
