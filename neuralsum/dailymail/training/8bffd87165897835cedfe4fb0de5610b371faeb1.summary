tea - time : two of the essentials to make a perfect brew - a kettle and milk - were considered good value for money ' people are having to be more and more aware of their spending day to day and squeeze the pennies further			1
' that makes them reassess every purchasing decision and clearly the value of an item is not always in line with the cost			0
he added that it is in interesting to see the range of areas where the worst value items can be found , saying it proves that @entity5 feel their lives are becoming increasingly expensive			1
mr @entity126 added : “ the study shows it ’s not about how much something costs but the level of value represented in the price - whether that ’s buying a stamp or a tv subscription , people are always very aware of what they are getting in return for their money			1
