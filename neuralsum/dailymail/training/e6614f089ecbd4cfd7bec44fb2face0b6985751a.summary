two men have admitted a string of pet cruelty charges after being caught sending live fish in the post			2
@entity6 started an online pet delivery business from his home in @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , along with friend @entity12 , a court heard this week			1
@entity10 magistrates heard on tuesday how @entity6 , 28 , posted animals in watertight bags placed inside boxes marked ' fragile ' using a private delivery firm			1
nondescript : one of the boxes used by @entity6 and @entity12 's business to send live pets to customers			2
the ' fragile ' tape was the only indication of the package 's contents the pets sent out to online buyers included terrapins , lizards and siamese fighting fish			1
@entity6 and @entity12 , 24 , of @entity9 - but now living in @entity32 - were arrested last year after a delivery worker from @entity34 discovered a fish in a package			2
when the @entity38 sent an officer to @entity6 's address , they found another courier leaving with a parcel containing live fish			1
both men were charged with causing unnecessary suffering to animals and @entity6 was also charged with failing to provide reasonable care to siamese fighting fish			0
risky : these two terrapins were sent in the post with little more protection than a watertight bag the court heard how the exotic pets were sent in ' clear plastic bags containing water ' , and after a search of @entity6 's home @entity38 officers found more animals in bags ready for transportation			1
@entity63 , prosecuting for the @entity38 , said although none of the animals had died they would have suffered from being posted to customers in boxes			1
he told the court : ' apart from having the label " fragile " on it , it had no information that it contained live animals			0
' it was opened and there was some newspaper and some bubble wrap and the terrapins were in a clear plastic bag			0
' the court heard how @entity81 invested £ 1,500 in the business , but left the day - to - day running to @entity83			0
exotic pet : @entity6 admitted failing to provide reasonable care to @entity86 after the @entity38 caught him sending them via couriers @entity89 , defending @entity90 , said his client had been ' looking after animals since he was seven ' and would never deliberately harm them			1
both men pleaded guilty to five counts of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and @entity6 also pleaded guilty to failing to provide reasonable care to siamese fighting fish			0
@entity12 was banned from owning aquatic animals for 10 years and ordered to pay £ 3,130 in court costs , as well as receiving a three - year conditional discharge			0
@entity6 was released on bail and will be sentenced on april 24			0
