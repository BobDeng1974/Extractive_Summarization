when you 're small in stature , life can sometimes go over your head			0
this was certainly the case for @entity7 the @entity9 pony , who at just 43in was unable to see over his stable door			1
but luckily for him , a group of local schoolchildren came to the rescue – by designing a special equine periscope			1
it was built by printing firm @entity26 , which heard about the idea through a volunteer			0
pint - sized @entity7 was kindly given a home at @entity30 , in @entity31 , @entity32 , last year as his height makes him perfect for small or disabled children to pet			1
builders estimated it would cost thousands of pounds for a bespoke , miniature pad for pedro - money the struggling charity do not have			0
so instead local school children thought up a special cardboard periscope dubbed the ' @entity20 ' he can peek through – and enjoy watching his trotting stable - mates			1
' the @entity20 ' helps pint - sized @entity7 see the outside world as he too small for his current stable door @entity45 ( pictured ) is just 43in tall and is unable to see over his stable door properly @entity47 from the charity , which gives disadvantaged children the chance to engage with horses , said : ' we 'd love to buy him a new miniature stable with a lower door			1
but this is a fun interim solution			0
' yesterday a delighted @entity7 used his ' @entity20 ' to view his friends and staff are now geeing themselves for the mammoth task of fundraising to build him a more size - appropriate home			1
funding manager ms @entity47 said : ' @entity7 spends lots of his time out in the paddock playing , so he has a wonderful life			2
' but we 'd love to buy him a new miniature stable with a lower door so he can look out and see what 's going on when relaxing in his stable			2
' while we raise the funds , we thought we 'd ask local schoolchildren to make it their project to invent a fun interim solution			0
local schoolchildren thought the idea up - @entity7 can now enjoy watching his stable - mates trot in the yard ' we were blown away by their ideas			1
little did we know one conversation with a volunteer would lead to a company agreeing to build a full - size working ' @entity20 '			2
we 're so thankful to them			0
' other ideas the children came up with included ' suspend him from a giant helium balloon ' , ' build a set of steps for his stable ' , ' cut a spy hatch into his door ' , and ' build him a very high straw bed			2
' @entity93 , 11 , said : ' @entity7 is so cute and our other horses love him			2
i 'd never seen a horse in real life ' til i came to @entity30 , never mind one as small as @entity7			1
' @entity98 , 15 , who coined the name ' @entity20 ' added : ' we 've been looking it up online and reckon it 's the world 's first pony periscope ! ' @entity7 eagerly attempts to get his bowl of feed being offered to him over his stable door by a helpful assistant @entity30 worker @entity106 , 25 , said : ' for kids who have never seen a horse , they can be scary at first so @entity7 's perfect for gaining their confidence			1
' last week he visited a school we work with where a number of students are wheelchair users			0
they loved him as he was so good with them			0
' the children come to us through referrals from schools , police and social workers			0
horse - riding gives them both an outlet and a direction in life			0
' alternative ideas thought up by schoolchildren included ' suspend him from a giant helium balloon ' , ' build a set of steps for his stable ' , ' cut a spy hatch into his door ' , and ' build him a very high straw bed ' riding instructor @entity139 , 24 , said : ' the children have been really imaginative in coming up with ideas for @entity7 's problem			1
' i love the ' @entity20 ' and @entity7 's just getting the hang of it			1
but really he would love a mini stable of his own			0
' @entity146 , 37 , mother of one of @entity7 's young autistic carers @entity149 , said : ' i 've grown up round @entity31 and i ca n't believe we 've got this community riding centre right on our doorstep			1
' it 's changed my son 's life			0
he was recently diagnosed with @entity156 , never did any sport and finds it hard to make friends at school			0
' but here , he 's like a different child			0
i 'm so grateful to @entity30			2
' anyone wishing to donate to help build @entity7 and new home can donate to @entity30 by texting @entity164 , along with any amount such as ' £ 5 ' , to 70070 .			1

@entity7 the pony is 43in tall and can not see properly over his stable door
he moved to the @entity30 charity in @entity31 , @entity32 , last year
his height makes him perfect for small or disabled children to pet
schoolchildren designed a special periscope called the @entity20 for him
*device* allows the pony to see over the gate and into the yard of his home
