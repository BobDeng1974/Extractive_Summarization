normal service was resumed as feuding @entity2 duo @entity1 and @entity3 finished one - two come the culmination of practice on friday for the @entity7 @entity6			1
after @entity9 's @entity8 had surprisingly split the pair in the opening 90 - minute session around @entity13 - with @entity3 comfortably quickest - come the second run , @entity1 held sway over his team - mate			1
for over an hour , though , it appeared to be a case of ' it never rains but it pours ' for @entity3 as he frustratingly looked on at his mechanics tending to his car plagued by an electrical issue			1
in this instance his troubles may only have been in second practice , affording him plenty of opportunity to recover , but nevertheless he must have been wondering ' why always me ? ' @entity3 will now naturally be hoping his misfortune is out of the way this weekend and he will run trouble - free through to the chequered flag on sunday			1
@entity3 managed to complete 16 laps compared to @entity1 's 41 , and would arguably have finished top of the timesheet but for traffic when he did finally take to the track with 25 minutes remaining			1
@entity3 emerged for the final 30 minutes to post the second fastest time in the second free practice session @entity1 finished top with a lap of one minute 26.225 seconds , although @entity3 would likely have found some satisfaction with clocking the quickest lap of the day in the morning outing with a 1min 26.187secs			1
the fact there is no difference in times between the hard and medium @entity69 tyres - the softer compound is normally far quicker - may surprise many , but the teams opted to perform heavy - fuel race simulations in @entity72 rather than qualifying runs , as is often the case in such a session			1
@entity3 ultimately finished 0.061secs adrift of @entity1 in @entity72 , with a further surprise the fact their rivals are far closer than perhaps was expected on a power circuit where @entity2 should be dominant			1

@entity89 ' @entity88 , @entity8 and reigning champion @entity90 in his @entity130 were all around half a second adrift in fifth , sixth and seventh			0
the team - mates of the trio completed the top 10 , with @entity9 's @entity92 eighth fastest , followed by @entity89 ' @entity94 and @entity130 's @entity96			1
leading the way : @entity1 is ahead of @entity3 n the drivers ' championship the @entity97 has won the last two races to thrust himself into title contention , but suffered technical issues of his own during practice to keep him three quarters of a second back			1
with all race drivers back in harness for @entity72 , after four reserves were used in the first session , there was still another familiar sight with the @entity154 propping up the pack			0
after being forced to sit out the race in @entity157 for what he has claimed are " political " reasons in his team , and also @entity162 at @entity13 , @entity117 was back behind the wheel for @entity72			0
banner : some @entity165 fans appeared to be unhappy with the sport 's new era the @entity118 was 21st , just under three seconds down , with team - mate @entity120 a fraction of a second down at the rear			1
@entity111 's @entity115 was 19th , the @entity170 even managing to finish ahead of @entity114 ' @entity116 .			1

@entity3 missed *majority* of second practice session with electrical issue
@entity170 took to track for final 30 minutes of session and posted 2nd best time
@entity1 led the way after ending the morning session behind his team - mate
@entity3 is 29 points adrift of @entity1 heading into sunday 's @entity7 *gp*
