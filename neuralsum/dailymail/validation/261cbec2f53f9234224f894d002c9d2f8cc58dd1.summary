the boss of the @entity1 is on a collision course with mps after he insisted the licence fee will work for at least another ten years			1
last week , the @entity5 said the £ 145.50 - a - year charge was ‘ anachronistic ’ and should be scrapped within the next decade in favour of a flat - rate broadcast levy on all households			1
but @entity10 , the @entity11 ’s director - general , insisted yesterday that the licence fee ‘ has got at least another ten years in it ’ , adding : ‘ i think it could go well beyond that			1
’ not dead yet : @entity1 director - general lord @entity10 has said he believes the licence fee ‘ has got at least another ten years in it ’ even if the fee is axed , he said it should be replaced by an equivalent charge			1
despite mps painting a damning picture of the @entity1 – which they said had blown billions of pounds of licence fee payers ’ money trying to be ‘ all things to all people ’ – @entity10 was optimistic			1
' i think the committee ’s report should really be commended because they have raised something which says , you know what , the licence fee is n’t dead , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity1 ai n’t dead			0
actually , it ’s got a real future			0
’ @entity1 is watching : the @entity1 has unveiled plans to ask users of its news app and iplayer catch - up service to sign up to ‘ @entity38 ’ , so it can learn about individuals ’ viewing habits mps said last week that a blanket levy on all households – not just those with televisions – should replace the licence fee which has funded the @entity1 for the past 69 years			2
yesterday , @entity10 backed the proposal , but said it was simply ‘ another way of the licence fee being modernised ’			2
but he also warned that the @entity1 risks ‘ sleepwalking into decay ’ unless it reinvents itself for the internet age by collecting users ’ data			0
@entity10 said @entity11 is in danger of becoming ‘ irrelevant ’ if it does not gather information about viewers to tailor its services , in a similar way to @entity61 and @entity62			0
his remarks came as the @entity1 unveiled plans to ask users of its news app and @entity67 catch - up service to sign up to ‘ @entity38 ’ , so it can learn about individuals ’ viewing habits and send them recommendations for other programmes and articles .			0

@entity10 believes the licence fee ‘ has got at least ten years in it ’
he said even if the fee is axed , it should be replaced by a charge
follows *critique* from mps that the charge is ‘ anachronistic ’
