@entity0 produced an error - strewn display which promised so much but ultimately delivered less than it should have done as @entity3 ’s men developed a severe case of white - line fever			1
the 12 point win means @entity8 ’s side have an excellent chance of claiming an unlikely @entity11 title if they can see off @entity13 more convincingly than @entity14 beat @entity15 or @entity16 beat @entity17			2
but they will be kicking themselves at an incredibly wasteful display which saw no fewer than six gilt - edged try - scoring opportunities wasted as passes went astray and support runners were ignored			0
@entity0 captain @entity24 lifts the @entity25 after @entity0 beat @entity15 25 - 13 at @entity26 in the @entity27 the @entity0 squad smile for the cameras having defeated @entity15 25 - 13 to win the @entity25 in their @entity27 clash @entity31 ( centre ) is congratulated by his @entity0 team - mates having scored an early try at @entity26 @entity35 got @entity0 off to a perfect start in the second - half with this early try to put the home side back in front @entity42 wing @entity40 crosses over to score @entity0 's third try of the evening at @entity26 to send them top of the table @entity0 xv : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity31 , @entity49 , @entity40 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity24 , @entity58 replacements : @entity51 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 tries : @entity31 , @entity50 , @entity40 conversions : @entity50 ( 2 ) penalties : @entity50 ( 2 ) @entity15 xv : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 ; @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84			1
replacements : @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 tries : @entity95 conversions : @entity97 ( 1 ) penalties : @entity97 ( 2 ) @entity0 did score three tries to @entity15 ’s one , leaving their points difference four points to the good over nearest title rivals @entity14 , but they could so easily have been out of sight if they ’d kept their composure with the line at their mercy			2
@entity31 , @entity35 and @entity40 all crossed for @entity3 ’s men , with @entity40 ’s late score adding some gloss to the scoreline			1
but @entity3 and his men will know this should have been so much more convincing			0
the @entity25 may be theirs , but this was far from the dominant , clinical performance @entity0 craved after the no - show in @entity118 a fortnight ago			2
rarely can a side have dominated an opening 20 minutes of international rugby so completely but to so little effect			0
time after time @entity15 ’s defence was torn to ribbons only for the @entity0 player in possession to run clumsily into contact , seemingly without any awareness of support runners or the need to shift the point of attack			1
@entity49 started the pattern after just two minutes when he completely ignored @entity48 on his right to blunder head down into @entity15 full back @entity136 , who pulled off the first of three fine tackles			2
in truth , @entity0 should have scored with something to spare			0
with five minutes on the clock , and @entity15 seemingly on the ropes already , @entity0 piled into @entity15 territory again and fly half @entity35 whipped a cleverly delayed pass to @entity31 and the @entity147 centre hot - stepped his way over			1
@entity35 added the extras to make it 7 - 0 and it looked for all the world as if @entity0 were set to take the visitors for a cricket score			1
after three slow starts in succession , finally @entity8 ’s men had the momentum early in the game			0
but , despite their dominance and superior attacking edge , @entity0 were simply unable to convert chances			0
@entity51 ( centre ) leads an @entity0 breakaway with his team - mates sprinting to joining in with his venture forward @entity167 hands off the tackle of @entity15 's @entity97 as @entity0 recovered from a half - time deficit to win at @entity26 @entity47 , making a welcome return from the concussion he suffered against @entity17 a month ago , latched on to a smart break down the short side from @entity167 after sharp work from @entity40			1
the @entity0 full back pinned his ears back from 20 metres but @entity136 had his measure on an arcing run and again the chance was lost as the ball was turned over			2
@entity40 – who looked sharp throughout – was at fault next when he made a powerful break through the middle of @entity15 ’s defence only to ignore support runners on both sides and slip ineffectively into @entity136 ’s grasp			2
it was another chance lost and @entity0 could hardly believe they were just seven points ahead after a first quarter that promised so much but ultimately delivered little			0
@entity0 's @entity47 attempts to keep a run going whilst missing a boot at @entity26 during the clash with @entity15 @entity15 attempt to clear their lines during the @entity27 clash at @entity26 with @entity56 ( right ) trying to block @entity48 runs clear for @entity3 's @entity0 side during the @entity25 contest with @entity15 at @entity26 if @entity0 have serious pretentions to challenge the world ’s top sides on a consistent basis they simply can not afford to waste chances like this			1
as @entity15 sensed they ’d somehow weathered the early storm , centre @entity95 forced his way over the line after 23 minutes on his side ’s first serious incursion into @entity0 ’s 22			1
@entity97 kicked the conversion and somehow @entity15 were level at 7 - 7			0
as the half wore on , @entity15 ’s confidence grew			0
@entity52 was penalised twice for boring in with @entity0 ’s scrum dominant while @entity53 ’s line - out radar was once again out of kilter			0
it came as no surprise when the @entity0 hooker was substituted early in the second half			2
@entity0 back - row @entity58 evades the tackles of two @entity228 opponents , hoping to kick start another attack @entity50 and @entity97 exchanged penalties before @entity47 was forced into emergency defensive action when @entity15 wing @entity232 cut through @entity0 ’s defence and look to be bound for a try			1
but @entity47 took him down , only for another penalty to be conceded , with @entity97 kicked , as @entity15 took a three - point lead in at half time			1
@entity0 again started the second - half brightly and @entity50 went over within two minutes of the re-start when @entity24 passed behind @entity0 ’s first line of attackers and the fly half scurried in behind the @entity15 defence			1
referee @entity246 chose not to refer his decision to the video referee despite suggestions of crossing			0
another penalty from the excellent @entity50 saw @entity8 ’s men into a 20 - 13 lead on 51 minutes but old habits die hard and @entity51 , on for the ineffective @entity53 , became the latest @entity0 latest player to qualify as a master butcher when he scythed through @entity15 ’s defence only to throw yet another pass to nowhere			1
@entity0 ’s profligacy was astonishing to witness , for all the wrong reasons			0
@entity47 looked to have scored on 62 minutes but – you guessed it – @entity57 ’s pass was rightly deemed forward and @entity0 had their second try chalked off for a forward pass			0
@entity48 had crossed in the first half only for @entity50 ’s earlier pass to @entity49 to be called forward			0
@entity40 dotted down late on to make it three tries to one			0
@entity0 's @entity54 ( left ) , @entity269 ( centre ) and @entity271 ( right ) prepare for another scrummage during the @entity25 @entity52 is hauled to the ground with team - mate @entity57 ( right ) watching on as @entity0 looked to build on their second - half lead @entity52 ( centre ) celebrates @entity0 's second try with scorer @entity35 ( left ) as @entity8 's side recovered to win on saturday @entity0 and @entity279 lock @entity56 jumps highest to win the lineout for the hosts as @entity3 's side went on the attack whilst the @entity0 players celebrate @entity40 's late try , the @entity15 players look devastated during the @entity25 defeat battered and bruised @entity0 players @entity54 ( left ) , @entity52 ( centre ) and the @entity51 brothers ( right ) pose with the @entity25 the @entity0 squad pose together with captain @entity24 ( centre ) looking after the @entity25 after defeating @entity15 25 - 13			1

@entity31 put @entity0 ahead early on with a fifth minute try for @entity3 's side
after a pulsating start for @entity0 , @entity15 recovered to lead 13 - 10 at half - time at @entity26
a @entity35 try early just after half - time put @entity0 back into the ascendancy and @entity40 went over late on
