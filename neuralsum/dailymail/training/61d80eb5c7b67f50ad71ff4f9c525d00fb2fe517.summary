the controversial new @entity2 president is not a ‘ sort of green - eyed federalist monster ’ , @entity0 claimed today			1
the former labour cabinet minister insisted @entity6 was not pushing for a @entity7 of @entity8 and feared @entity9 exiting the @entity10 would be a ‘ disaster ’			1
but he warned @entity12 to stop brandishing his in - out referendum like ‘ some sort of pistol ’ to threaten other @entity10 leaders : ‘ agree with us , or else ’			1
@entity0 , a former @entity18 commissioner , insisted @entity19 was not pushing for a @entity7 of @entity8 mr @entity6 was confirmed as the new president of the @entity2 on friday , after mr @entity12 became embroiled in bitter row with his @entity10 counterparts			1
mr @entity12 condemned the decision as a ‘ bad day for @entity8 ’			1
the @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 all agreed mr @entity6 , a former prime minister of @entity28 , was the wrong person for the job			1
it is feared his reputation as a pro-federalist will make it harder for mr @entity12 to claw powers back from @entity18			2
@entity0 conceded mr @entity6 was not an ‘ ideal candidate ’ but insisted there were ‘ encouraging signs ’ that he is open to @entity9 ’s demands			2
prime minister @entity12 said it was a bad day for @entity8 when @entity10 leaders handed mr @entity6 the role of president of the @entity2 @entity12 's strategy to try to stop @entity6 from getting the @entity18 job by a former top diplomat			1
@entity49 , former @entity10 director at the @entity50 and until last year the government 's top trade official , said the strategy ' was , and is , the right thing to try to get someone other than @entity6 '			2
writing on his blog , mr @entity49 added : ' he ’s a corporatist , unsympathetic to flexibility and subsidiarity , and does n’t seem to have much sympathy for the @entity9 ’s thinking			0
' that ’s not what the @entity10 needs just now			0
' he added : ' on issues that matter in the @entity10 , you are always best stating your case forcibly , politely , but clearly			0
' mr @entity49 warned of ' a bit of bumpiness ' in @entity9 's relationship with @entity70 , but said it depends on ' whether either @entity12 or @entity72 think they were genuinely misled by the other in any of their discussions '			2
@entity0 , a former @entity8 commissioner , met mr @entity6 at a summit in @entity77 last week			2
‘ he explicitly said that he does not advocate a @entity7 of @entity8 – he ’s not a sort of green - eyed federalist monster , as some in @entity9 have portrayed him , ’ he told @entity79 ’s today programme			1
‘ secondly , he strongly agreed with me when i said that , were @entity9 to leave the @entity10 , it would n’t just be a catastrophe for @entity9 , it would be a disaster for the @entity10 as a whole			0
‘ and the third thing i was struck by was his emphasis on the economy in @entity8 and the need to drive up our competitiveness and our share in global markets			0
and that would mean he accepted extending and deepening @entity8 ’s single market			0
‘ so these are encouraging signs about his policy agenda and we ’ve now got to set about working with him in them			0
’ writing in @entity104 , mr @entity12 today insisted he can still secure reforms to @entity9 's relationship with @entity8			2
' i am ready to move on and keep fighting for @entity9 's interests in @entity8 , ' he wrote			0
referring to previous claims by mr @entity6 that he was ready to deliver a ' fair deal ' for @entity9 , mr @entity12 said : ' if by a fair deal , we can agree that we are not heading , at different speeds , to the same place - as some have assumed up to now - then there is business we can do			1
' however , @entity0 warned the prime minister against repeatedly using his threat of an in - out referendum by 2017 to get what he wants in @entity8			1
‘ i would just give this advice to the prime minister : stop waving around this threat of a referendum in @entity9 as if it ’s some sort of pistol that we ’re holding to everyone ’s head and saying ‘ you ’ve got to agree with us , or else ’			1
’ he said mr @entity12 had to come up with reforms of benefit to @entity8 as a whole and not just give the impression that the only reason that he is advocating these measures is because of divisions in the @entity139 party			0
‘ the problem is that the prime minister in the way he ’s gone about handling @entity9 ’s interests in @entity8 has rather isolated himself			0
‘ he makes it more difficult for people to back him , even when they agree with the points he is making			0
‘ he does find it very difficult now to get others in the @entity10 to follow him on anything and that , i ’m afraid , is a direct result of the way in which he ’s conducted his case in @entity18			0
