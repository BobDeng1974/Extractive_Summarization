for the co-founder of @entity1 said to be worth more than half a billion pounds , the £ 1.1million house he bought in 2009 was not going to break the bank but it was his dream home			1
however , once @entity8 , 46 , scratched the ' veneer of quality ' of his new @entity12 - style mansion , it soon became clear the ' shambolic ' property was in such a bad state he had to knock it down and start again			1
behind its glazed walls and minimalist interiors the house on one of @entity20 's most desirable private estates in @entity21 , had such serious defects that made it unfit for human habitation , the millionaire said			2
modern : this is the house at the centre of the @entity30 row before it was knocked down by @entity1 founder @entity8 changes : the entrepreneur , said to be worth £ 600m , has since started rebuilding the home but pursued the former owners through the courts and lost yesterday dream : the property ( circled ) sits facing the @entity39 marina in an enviable position but soon after this picture was taken it was condemned a more recent image shows where the house used to stand the keen yachtsman and his wife had moved there because it is a stone 's throw from the famous marina on the @entity39			1
his anger was such that the @entity52 took the previous owners @entity54 and @entity55 to court , but he has failed to convince a top judge that he was a victim of unscrupulous property developers			2
mr @entity59 said mr @entity8 ’s case had not looked promising from the start and concluded that neither ms @entity55 nor ms @entity54 had been aware of any significant construction defects			2
he said the evidence pointed ' overwhelmingly ' to the conclusion that ms @entity55 and ms @entity54 had created their ' dream home ' - which enjoys spectacular views over @entity69 from @entity72 estate - and did intend to sell when they embarked on a re-building project			0
row : @entity73 yachtsman @entity8 and his wife @entity74 bought the home on the @entity21 coast from @entity54 ( pictured right yesterday ) and her partner but the court found in their favour imagination : @entity8 and @entity81 came up with the idea of @entity1 in 2003 and within 8 years it was sold for $ 8.5bn jan 2003 : entrepreneurs @entity8 and @entity81 come up with the concept of @entity1			1

may 2011 : @entity97 buys @entity1 for $ 8.5billion the lesbian couple - who celebrated a civil partnership in 2008 and had been together for 20 years - said afterwards the case had left them ' physically and mentally ' drained			1
' the evidence points overwhelmingly , in my view , to the conclusion that they built it as their dream home as they have always contended ' , the judge told them yesterday			2
in true @entity112 - style , ms @entity55 and ms @entity54 bought the property in 2004 for £ 360,000 , later demolishing the existing house there and building what they hoped would be the sort of @entity12 beauty beloved of @entity120 presenter @entity119			1
the couple , from the @entity122 area , told the court that , despite their intense desire to live in the house , they were forced to sell to the @entity127 because of trouble meeting the mortgage and difficulties with a near neighbour			0
@entity132 entrepreneur @entity8 helped build the @entity1 brand into an online giant			1
in may 2011 the internet phone service was bought by @entity97 for around $ 8.5billion , its biggest - ever cash deal , and @entity8 is believed to have got at least $ 500million of it			1
during the home - row court case mr @entity8 ’s barrister , @entity138 , had told the court he believed he was buying a ' new luxury house ' , built to a high standard			1
' instead , once the sale was complete and builders started opening up areas to undertake what should have been minor works , it became apparent that the construction of the property was a shambles , ' he said			0
@entity152 : @entity1 co-founder @entity8 is said to be worth £ 600million , much of which was generated when the online phone service was sold to @entity97 for $ 8.5billion start again : @entity8 was forced to bring in the builders to his @entity12 - mansion in @entity39 , @entity21 because he claimed it was unsafe site : the keen yachtsman bought it on the @entity162 private estate which is a matter of metres from the famous @entity39 marina major defects had been disguised behind finishes that gave ' the veneer of quality ' but which hid problems which gave no choice but to demolish and start again			1
not only was the house not fit for human habitation , he claimed , but it was also dangerous in some respects and had to be knocked down			0
however , dismissing the @entity177 ’ claims against ms @entity54 and ms @entity55 , the judge said they were genuinely ignorant of the ins and out of construction work and had not operated as commercial property developers .			2
