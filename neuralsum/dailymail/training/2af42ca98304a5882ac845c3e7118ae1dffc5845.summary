a report has revealed that one in five crimes goes unrecorded due to failures by police one in five crimes goes unrecorded because of failures by police			1
up to 740,000 victims of violence , burglary and other offences are being denied justice , a report revealed yesterday			2
one rape was not logged because the officer thought it would be too much work			1
an attack on a boy with autism was written off as ‘ sexual experimentation ’			0
the report by @entity22 ’s @entity21 piles pressure on forces already under fire for @entity26 , @entity27 and the abuse of stop and search powers			1
it said the sheer number of unresolved crimes meant some officers had to be guilty of ‘ discreditable or unethical behaviour ’			2
and the investigation reinforces warnings from statisticians and mps that crime figures can not be trusted			0
spelling out the human cost , the report said : ‘ victims are failed because the crimes against them are not investigated , they have no hope of justice according to the law			1
’ the unrecorded rape case led to accusations of laziness from campaigners			1
‘ this is about much more than inaccurate statistics or poor number - crunching , ’ said @entity53			0
‘ each mistake represents a victim losing their chance to get justice and to access support services			0
‘ it is completely unacceptable that victims of any crimes – let alone serious sexual offences such as rape – should have their complaints go unrecorded or downgraded because of police incompetence or even laziness			1
‘ most victims want more than anything for their offender not to commit another crime , but if the police ca n’t reliably recognise and record when and where a crime has been committed , their efforts to cut crime may well be misdirected			2
’ police ignored a complaint made on behalf of a female rape victim by a doctor who had examined her injuries			1
a report of several assaults by a member of staff at a care home on teenage victims went similarly unrecorded			1
home secretary @entity92 said : ‘ i commissioned @entity21 to carry out this investigation in order to get a detailed assessment of how the police are treating recorded crime statistics			1
@entity21 ’s interim report exposes unacceptable failings by the police			1
home secretary and minister for women @entity92 says the report has exposed ' unacceptable failings ' by police ‘ it is quite possible , once @entity21 has completed its work on recorded crime statistics and made recommendations on how the police need to improve , that we will see an increase in recorded crime			1
’ she pointed out however that offending was at its lowest level since 1981			0
inspectors carried out checks on 13 police forces and listened to phone calls made by members of the public			1
these were checked against police records to see if the incidents had been properly logged			1
out of a sample of 3,102 incidents , @entity21 found 2,551 crimes should have been recorded , but 523 were not , including sexual offences , crimes of violence , robbery and burglary and even 14 rapes			2
@entity22 chief inspector of constabulary , @entity134 , says the consequences of under - recording of crime are ' serious ' the watchdog said the figures suggested 20 per cent of crimes may be going unrecorded			1
last year , police recorded 3.7million offences			2
the inspectors said : ‘ in the light of what we have so far found it is difficult to conclude that none of these failures was the result of discreditable or unethical behaviour			2
the failure rate is too high			0
’ @entity22 chief inspector of constabulary @entity134 said : ‘ the consequences of under - recording of crime are serious , and may mean victims and the community are failed			0
’ the report comes after serious concerns were raised over the integrity of crime figures , sparked by claims made by former metropolitan police officer @entity161 last year			1
mr @entity161 told mps that massaging crime figures to hit performance targets had become ‘ an ingrained part of policing culture ’			0
police forces inspected so far are @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180			2
the remainder will be checked ahead of a final report in the autumn			0
police wrongly allowed more than 50,000 hardened criminals to dodge court last year , the report reveals			2
in around 400,000 cases , offenders guilty of violence , drug use , yobbery and other offences escaped with a caution , penalty notice , cannabis warning or ‘ community resolution ’			0
but inspectors found that in one in every seven cases this had been a mistake			0
out - of - court disposals are supposed to be used for low - level crimes committed by first - or second - time offenders			0
but police were doling them out to convicts with long histories of law - breaking			0
it is yet another example of victims of crime being failed , @entity22 ’s @entity21 found			0
in many cases , victims were not consulted or told how their attacker would be punished			0
the report said offenders ‘ were given out - of - court disposals when their offending histories ought to have precluded the imposition of such a disposal ’			0
it went on : ‘ in some of these cases , the offender ought to have been charged or summonsed to court			0
’ shadow home secretary @entity226 said ministers should stop community resolutions being used for serious crimes .			1

claims one rape not logged as officer thought it would be too much work
