by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 will sit out the rest of practice on friday ahead of the @entity6 @entity5 due to an electrical fault with his @entity8			1
the reigning four - times @entity10 champion completed just four laps of the opening 90 - minute practice session at the @entity13 in @entity14 before parking his car on the side of the track			1
although the @entity19 was returned to the garage on the back of a flat - bed truck , and the team had 50 minutes to work on the issue , it has since been discovered the problem is too complex to fix in one day			0
blow : @entity2 stopped on track after completing only four laps in friday 's opening practice session keeping her steady : the @entity32 driver maintains a keen eye on his @entity8 as it is loaded on to a truck via their @entity37 feed , the team said : ' due to an electrical problem that has damaged the wiring loom of @entity40 , @entity2 will not be able to take part in @entity42			1
' the team will use the time to fix it to be ready for @entity46 tomorrow			2
' ahead of this weekend 's return to action after a recent mini-break , @entity8 opted to change the chassis on @entity2 's car			2
the 26 - year - old has so far endured a rough campaign in his bid for a fifth successive title , notably in the last two races being asked to move aside for team - mate @entity57 due to a lack of pace			0
@entity2 had hoped the change of chassis would bring with it a change of luck , albeit appreciating there would unlikely be any difference in performance			0
tough times : the reigning world champion has endured a miserable start to the new campaign time to thing : @entity2 reflects on a difficult start to his @entity6 @entity5 weekend as his car is towed away instead , the @entity32 described it as ' a sanity check ' , to eradicate any possible demons inside his head he may have associated with his current form			1
with 33 points from the four grands prix to date , @entity2 trails championship leader @entity82 by 46 points			0
this latest problem is unlikely to alleviate the feeling that things are going against him this season .			0

@entity2 completed only four laps before the fault with his @entity8
but the @entity32 will be ready to take part in @entity46 and *qualifying* on *saturday*
@entity2 has endured a troubled start to the *defence* of his @entity10 crown
