it ’s dog eat dog in the wild , or in the case of this video captured by a visitor to the @entity7 in @entity8 , it ’s a matter of crocodile or lion eats elephant			1
when an elephant died at the side of a lake in the @entity20 reserve , leaving enough meat to feed a multitude of animals , a group of hungry lions and a crocodile with a serious meat craving immediately clocked the easy catch			1
but the elephant meat was n’t easy for either predator to win if this video of a rare stand - off between crocodile and lion , uploaded to @entity29 by @entity30 , is to be believed			1
no sooner than each animal spots its ready - killed prey , the young male lion and muscular @entity35 crocodile , the world ’s largest reptilian predator , which boasts over 30 teeth in its gargantuan jaw , begin to eye each other up			0
it might initially seem that the crocodile has the evolutionary upper hand , killing creatures as it has been for over 250 million years and outliving even the dinosaurs , but as two more lions join their daring companion , pinning the reptile down in the water , it starts to seem like this is anyone ’s game			2
face off : two of the most ferocious species in @entity20 prepare to duel over hard won elephant meat a cry for help ? as the trio of ferocious lions overwhelm the solitary crocodile it spreads its jaw , as if wailing much splashing ensues and although one lion is left with blood on its leg , the first round of fighting leaves the crocodile and cat on a level peg			1
it might be three against one , but this is by no means an easy ride for the lions			0
a massive 99 per cent of young crocodiles end up being eaten by fish , lizards and even other cannibalistic crocodiles , so the ones who end up surviving are the toughest of the tough , with a jaw so powerful it ’s thought to rival that of a t - rex			0
splash attack : water flies as the lions and crocodile get rowdy in the @entity20 lake a tough tackle : the lions join their forces to pile onto the crocodile and pin down the ancient beast an issue experienced by @entity95 filming this jaw - dropping scene means that the second fight is seen in a dramatic slow motion succession of still shots that see the lions slap the crocodile around the snout like house cats batting string			1
the reptile weakens as the lions pile onto the ancient reptile , one of them even blighting it further by biting its pointy webbed foot			0
as the battle concludes , the crocodile retreats , crippled and defeated			2
the lion who picked the fight stands water - soaked and triumphant over its weakened opponent while the rest of its pride descend to gorge on the elephant prize			0
meow ! the lion lashes out at its reptilian opponent 's jaw , which thought to be as strong as that of a @entity125 eyes on the prize : a pride of lions gorge on the tough - won dead elephant that will feed them well			0
