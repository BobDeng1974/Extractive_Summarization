the @entity1 divide is blurred in @entity2 , where the multi-millionaire footballers of the two great @entity5 clubs make their homes			1
there is a scent in the air as you drive along its sunken lanes , not only that autumnal blend of burning wood and rotting leaves — but of money			2
this @entity18 village , a few miles north of @entity16 , is one of the richest places outside the @entity21 of @entity22 — part of a triangle of wealth formed with the nearby settlements of @entity27 and @entity28			2
@entity29 has object to ' affordable ' houses being built near to her eight - bedroom mansion in @entity2 @entity29 , wife of @entity22 and @entity34 captain @entity33 , wrote an angry letter to the council about the plans mrs @entity29 grew up in a rough area of @entity39 in @entity40 , but has objected to ' affordable ' homes being built there are some cheaper houses in @entity2 — think £ 900,000 - plus for a four - bedroom bungalow — but very few are ‘ affordable ’ in the sense the government means : ones that young couples on average incomes have enough money to buy			1
so when a local developer suggested building five ‘ affordable homes ’ as part of a small ‘ executive ’ development — 15 houses in total — on the outskirts of the village , it might be expected that its more fortunate inhabitants , particularly those from humble backgrounds , would be in favour of the plan			1
after all , @entity29 , wife of @entity34 and @entity22 captain @entity33 , knows what a struggle life can be			1
her mum was a nursery nurse who grew up in a rough area of @entity39 in @entity40			1
and today , even though the @entity74 ’ home on the outskirts of the village is a mansion worth about £ 5 million , they must remember the days before their world transmuted into an endless round of @entity80 holidays , @entity81 — and disappointing @entity22 performances			1
but do they want affordable homes for people from similar backgrounds as themselves to be built near them and lived in by people not unlike themselves ? certainly not ! ‘ let ’s not ruin our village , ’ mrs @entity29 wrote this week in a letter to her local planning authority , @entity90			1
‘ the development would be in direct conflict with the national policy to protect green belt land			1
’ she went on to warn of the dangers of increased traffic and damage to the ‘ special landscape , character and appearance of the area ’			1
in a show of support that points to the village ’s unusual make - up , mrs @entity29 was supported by the wife of glam - rock band @entity111 ’s frontman @entity110			1
the holders are long - standing residents of @entity2 and live on the same secluded cul - de - sac as the @entity116			2
‘ @entity2 is an historic village and we need to preserve its character and setting , ’ wrote @entity117			1
on thursday , the council planning committee threw out the offending application , though it may yet be resubmitted			1
all very well — except that when it comes to altering the ‘ special landscape , character and appearance of the area ’ the @entity116 have form			1
@entity29 has hit out at plans to build 15 homes on @entity132 land ( pictured ) , just yards from her £ 12million @entity18 mansion ( circled ) mrs @entity29 ’s concern for the green belt , expressed in suspiciously legalistic language , is no doubt sincere			1
but some may be tempted to accuse her of , at best , nimby - ism and , at worst , double standards			2
as @entity141 , a surveyor advising the thwarted developers @entity143 , says : ‘ there is a contradiction			2
the @entity74 ’ house is like a mini office building and it seems slightly strange that they should object to what is a very sympathetic development on adjoining land			1
’ in architectural terms , the @entity74 ’ house , completed in 2005 , is a sprawling , characterless pile of the kind to be seen in many a faceless gated community in @entity158			2
the three - storey mansion boasts all the toys a star footballer would expect — swimming pool , @entity163 , gym , cinema — and all the style of one of the cheaper @entity169 themed hotels			1
@entity171 columns and gold bath taps are said to grace the interior — but who really knows ? outside , the 20 acres of grounds are surrounded by high perimeter walls studded with security cameras			2
there is nothing pretty about the house dubbed @entity181 , and no one in their right mind could describe it as being in sympathy with that ‘ special landscape ’ so treasured by mrs @entity29			1
there is also the fact that it replaced a perfectly adequate and less obtrusive five - bedroom property of 1930s vintage			2
in this , the @entity116 represent part of a controversial trend			0
the golden couple ’s arrival in @entity2 presaged an influx of footballers , mainly from @entity34 and @entity198 and all stupendously well - paid and able to afford rocketing asking prices			0
@entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 have lived in the village at various times			0
the former @entity22 cricketer @entity205 is another well - known resident			0
of course , it was n’t just footballers who turned this corner of @entity18 into a @entity210 @entity209 , but they played their part			0
one by one , perfectly good houses in the @entity2 - @entity28 area were torn down to be replaced by palaces of varying degrees of ghastliness			1
you see them as you drive around : partially hidden behind gates , walls and hedges , but still hideous — and most definitely not in sympathy with a beautiful landscape , framed in the east by the @entity225			0
at its height in 2008 , the mansion - building splurge prompted @entity228 , a veteran @entity229 councillor , to call a halt			1
the plans , submitted to @entity90 , would see five ' affordable ' homes built on @entity132 land ‘ since @entity33 moved into the village it ’s been a snowball effect , ’ she said			1
‘ some of the houses do need pulling down , but the houses they ’re building to replace them are just so huge			1
they are going up to three storeys high			0
it ’s destroying the character of the village			0
’ the style of the new homes has not been the only issue — their inhabitants ’ behaviour continues to draw criticism			1
@entity253 , a member of @entity254 , says that the footballers ‘ do n’t take part in the village			0
they live behind locked gates ; they close themselves off from day one			0
’ there is also suspicion over their enthusiasm for the knock - downs and rebuilds			0
building costs on new homes are not subject to @entity269 , which would add 20 per cent to the bill			1
‘ there is another story to this , ’ says mr @entity253			0
‘ if you modernise a house , you pay vat on it ; if you build a new house , you do n’t			1
so there is a financial advantage to knock - down and rebuild over renovation			0
’ there is , of course , an argument that such wealthy residents must bring much - needed funds to what could be a sleepy country village			0
but stroll down @entity2 ’s pretty @entity288 , past the parish church towards the admiral rodney pub , and there are a disturbing number of for sale and to let signs adorning empty shops and offices			0
‘ footballers and celebrities tend to spend their money out of the area rather than in it , ’ says @entity297 , a member of @entity90			2
while he says @entity29 does occasionally use the local co-op — as does @entity205 — in his eyes , @entity2 has altered over the past 10 or 15 years			1
‘ i do appreciate it ’s difficult for @entity33 to walk up and down the street because he gets people coming up and asking him for autographs			0
‘ people like him live a more protected life			0
but , unfortunately , it is changing the village			0
it ’s changing it away from a community			0
’ the actor @entity315 , who plays @entity316 in @entity317 and runs a farm shop in the village , begs to differ			0
other well - known residents do contribute to local life , he says			0
@entity29 , pictured on another holiday in @entity323 , where she and @entity33 own a second home , objected to the plans because she believes the new builds would ' ruin ' her village ‘ @entity29 and her husband support the village shops and , when they ’re around , they go to the local @entity330 restaurant , ’ he says			1
‘ @entity205 comes in our shop most days and he drinks in the pub. [ former footballer turned @entity336 pundit ] @entity338 shops with us			0
[ @entity340 player ] @entity201 shops with us , as does the wife of [ @entity198 captain ] @entity344			0
’ as for the @entity116 ’ stubborn stance on the housing plans , he says : ‘ it ’s not nimby - ism — they have every right to object			2
’ maybe , but it may seem to outsiders like one planning law for some and another law for others			2
certainly , those who live in the shadow of the vast new mansions find it impossible to ignore the area ’s celebrity status			2
‘ we who have lived here for a long time are both amused by it and morbidly fascinated by it , but it also intrudes into our daily lives , ’ says @entity363 , a resident of @entity28			0
‘ i ’m sure it keeps property prices high and provides employment — but then you have the house building			2
’ the strength of feeling even prompted him to write a poem about it , which has been published on the website of the local residents ’ group			0
naming no names , the verses describe ‘ a house like an office block ’ — a vast concrete - and - glass monstrosity surrounded by gates and ‘ walls like @entity392 ’			0
the problem , of course , it that ‘ though neighbours think it ’s as ugly as sin , a footballer thinks that it ’s heaven ’ .			0

@entity29 *slammed* plans to build 15 homes next to her mansion
mrs @entity29 wrote an angry letter to the council over the planned build
she wrote that she was concerned about building on @entity132 land
five of the houses would have been ' affordable ' homes , plans say
mrs @entity29 was brought up in a rough area of @entity39 , in @entity40
