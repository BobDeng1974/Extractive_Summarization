' he was holding his breath and challenging himself to see how many laps can i do			2
' @entity35 jumped in the pool to try and tried to resuscitate him but she could n't and he died			0

a change.org petition last month , which has now closed , called on the aquarium to ' pull down the misleading poster '			0

' a spokesperson for the @entity8 campaign said ' this specific advertisement is a part of a larger campaign , which is certainly not intended to encourage children to take any of the comparisons with the @entity10 literally , including the holding of one 's breath for any period of time			1
' ' the campaign is rather intended for adults and children alike to interpret the comparisons of humans to dugongs as a fun way to learn about the anatomy , personalities and quirks of our famous dugongs , @entity158 and @entity159			2
' ' however , we do acknowledge this is a real issue and so have taken the steps to ensure our campaign does n’t contribute further to it			2
