it is the second heaviest ban of the @entity7 era			0
@entity35 , the late former @entity36 hooker , was suspended for 10 matches for knocking out @entity38 and breaking the cheekbone of @entity40 while playing for @entity2 against @entity5 in 2005 but the ban was extended to seven months when his appeal was rejected			1

it was something that happened in the heat of the moment when our emotions and adrenaline were running high			0
i instantly regretted it and am devastated that i allowed myself to punch someone like this			0
flower has been fined 50 per cent of his wages for three months by @entity2 ' at @entity2 we are known for being aggressive but we are constantly told to do this within the rules of the game and that punching is n't tough			1
we may aim to dominate teams , but we do n't aim to hurt people			0
' he added after being punished by his club : ' i fully accept this decision taken by @entity2			0
i deeply regret my actions and i am grateful for the support that my club has given me throughout this process			0
