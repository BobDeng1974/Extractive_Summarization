@entity0 was in no mood to celebrate as @entity2 secured their place in the semi-final of the @entity5 with a 5 - 3 penalty shoot - out victory over @entity7 on wednesday			1
the @entity2 boss instead admitted his concern at the scoring touch which appears to have deserted his side in recent games , with the @entity14 champions only finding the net once in their last three matches			2
@entity0 believes the team is shackled by the absence of @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity2 manager @entity0 is concerned about his team without @entity20 and @entity19 @entity19 ( left ) is absent with an ankle injury while @entity20 is out until may with a stomach muscle tear ' without @entity20 and @entity19 , we are a different team , ' @entity0 said after the game			1
' of course we have big problems because we have no players for the one - on - one situations			0
we have other players and have to adapt the game for them			0
' @entity20 was ruled out for around two months with a stomach muscle tear at the end of march			0
@entity19 has an uncertain timescale on his recovery from an ankle injury but is doubtful for the first leg of @entity39 's @entity38 quarter - final tie against @entity40			2
@entity39 's players celebrate after progressing to the semi-final of the @entity5 @entity43 scored the winning penalty for @entity39 against @entity7 as the shoot - out was won 5 - 3 @entity0 will hope he can inspire his players to overcome the problem when they host @entity48 on saturday in the @entity49 , looking to maintain their 10 - point advantage over @entity51			1
the one goal @entity2 did score over their last three encounters came from @entity54 in the 1 - 0 win against his former club @entity56 and the two sides will meet again in the semi-final .			0
