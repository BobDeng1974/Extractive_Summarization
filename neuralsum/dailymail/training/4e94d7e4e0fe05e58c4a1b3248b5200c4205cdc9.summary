economy seats on airplanes are a tight enough squeeze as it is			2
and with roughly 64 per cent of adults in the @entity6 classed as overweight or obese , the size issue is becoming more of a problem on flights			0
as seating on flights appears to get smaller , the population is getting larger , prompting one expert to call for airlines to reflect this with their plane layouts			0
@entity16 says airlines should offer a new class of ' wide ' economy seats for those who are larger @entity16 , founder of airfarewatchdog.com named ' @entity21 ' by @entity22 , has come up with a solution			1
he 's advocated a new class of ' wide ' economy seats to accommodate those who take up more space			0
rather than changing all seating on flights , mr @entity16 is advocating creating two rows of wider seats for obese passengers			1
the average economy class airline seat is around 17 inches wide , which mr @entity16 claims can even be too small for people who are of a larger build but do n't have a weight issue , causing discomfort for neighbouring passengers			1
economy seats measure 17 inches wide although many people , including body builders , surpass that as policy with more airlines stands , they request ' passengers of size ' who ca n't fully lower the arm rest because of their width , to buy an extra seat ( although most do n't bother ) and in extreme cases crew can refuse to let overweight passengers board flights			1
@entity16 suggests adding one or two rows of ' economy - class wide ' seats to planes instead , similar to the economy comfort seating which is offered by @entity60			1
the carrier charges up to $ 75 ( Â£ 50 ) extra each way depending on whether the flight is domestic or international			0
for that fee , customers receive up to four inches more legroom and up to 50 per cent more seat recline			1
mr @entity16 said : ' why not install one or two rows - just four or eight economy seats - in a two - by - two configuration with the standard amount of legroom ? most airline 's irlines policy says ' passengers of size ' should buy an extra seat or might be refused to board ' no extra perks - no priority boarding , no free snacks - just extra width , and charge the same that airlines now charge for extra legroom			1
' ' these seats would be about eight inches wider			1
if no " passengers of size " needed or reserved them , then the airlines could give them to their frequent fliers at check - in or to lucky passengers by the luck of the draw			0
this would be a great status perk and solve the spill - over issue			0
' in the past , proposals from airline manufacturer @entity98 to reduce seat sizes to accommodate new extra-wide seats have enraged passengers			2
64 % of @entity6 adults are classed as overweight or obese , making the size problem a growing one on flights eighty - four per cent of respondents to a recent survey by @entity107 said the move would be deeply unfair			0
@entity110 boss @entity109 also caused controversy by suggesting introducing a ' fat tax ' for obese passengers , forcing them to pay more			2
the outspoken ceo 's idea prompted a flurry of surveys to understand whether passengers were in agreement or against the proposal			0
nearly half of the people asked ( 48 per cent ) in a survey by @entity124 felt that overweight passengers should be charged extra to board their flight			2
men in particular thought those carrying excessive body weight should pay the price , with 51 per cent of men in favour of additional charges compared to 43 per cent of women .			0

@entity16 , airfarewatchdog.com founder , issues advice for new seats
he says obesity causes ' problems ' when flying *commercially*
@entity16 suggests up to eight seats be added that are eight inches wider
passengers would pay the same amount as extra legroom for extra width
