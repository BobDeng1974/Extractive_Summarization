the @entity10 pointed out that former @entity12 boss sir @entity11 started his career at the retailer stacking shelves			1
lashed out : @entity16 has attacked graduates who think they are ' too good ' to stack shelves tough talk : the @entity10 was speaking to @entity20 on the @entity21 today in a direct rebuke to @entity25 , he added : ‘ the next time one of these smart people that say there ’s something wrong with this goes into their supermarket , ask themselves this simple question			2
‘ when they ca n’t find the food on the shelves , who is more important : them , the geologist , or the person that stacked the shelf ? ’ example : former @entity12 ceo , sir @entity11 , started his career at the retailer stacking shelves miss @entity4 , 24 , is now working part - time in a supermarket			2
she said she did not object to menial work – simply the fact that she was not being paid			0
last week ’s @entity49 ruling forced ministers to hurriedly re-write the rules surrounding a string of back - to - work schemes , and could result in compensation of more than £ 40million being paid to jobless claimants who had their benefits stopped for refusing to do work experience			1
in a defiant intervention on the @entity59 ’s @entity21 show yesterday , mr @entity1 made it clear he would not back down			1

' most young people love this programme and i am sorry but there are a group of people out there who think they are too good for this kind of stuff			0
’ he added : ‘ i am not going to give way on this			0
i absolutely clearly tell you this : people who think it is their right to take benefit and do nothing for it – those days are over			0
’ last week ’s ruling found that the government ’s regulations failed to give the unemployed enough information , especially about the sanctions for refusing jobs under the schemes			0
but it rejected miss @entity4 ’s claim that being forced to do unpaid work experience breached her human rights			0
miss @entity4 said last week : ‘ i do n’t think i am above working in @entity8			0
’ rebuke : mr @entity1 dismissed suggestions the flagship back - to - work scheme is ' slave labour '			1
