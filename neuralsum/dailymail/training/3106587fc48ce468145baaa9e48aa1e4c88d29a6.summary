@entity0 has been told ‘ you must do better with your policies ’ in a scathing report from his former school headmaster			1
@entity6 ’s @entity5 triggered a furious political row last week when he warned top public schools they would lose £ 700 million if they did n’t help local state pupils			2
the plan was dismissed as ‘ class war ’ by critics			0
@entity0 's former headmaster at the £ 17,835 - a - year @entity14 in @entity15 said he was ' disappointed ' that the @entity6 shadow education spokesman ' pictured ' had such an ' unoriginal policy ' but now @entity18 , the retired headteacher who taught mr @entity0 at the £ 17,835 - a - year @entity14 ( @entity14 ) in @entity15 , has issued his withering verdict			1
he dismisses the plan as ‘ completely old hat ’ , saying it was first floated by @entity22 , and that it would be a ‘ seven - day wonder ’			2
he has also ordered him to come up with better plans to improve the state sector			0
mr @entity18 – who took over at @entity14 in 1983 , before mr @entity0 entered the school – told @entity28 he was ‘ disappointed ’ that ‘ such an intelligent , articulate and delightful man has come up with something so totally unoriginal ’			1
mr @entity18 said : ‘ i would have expected more from him than this tired old saw , [ such as ] some proper ideas to improve schools			1
’ mr @entity0 , 40 , angered private school headteachers by warning that under a @entity37 they would lose the tax breaks associated with their charitable status if they did not share teachers and facilities with local state schools			1
@entity18 , pictured , said @entity22 was calling for similar policies in the 1970s , describing mr @entity0 's plans for private schools as ' old hat ' but mr @entity18 , 77 , who retired in 1996 and now has a building at the school named after him , said : ‘ this is an idea which has been around for decades – i remember @entity22 calling for it in the 1970s			1
it is completely old hat and i am rather sad about it , because @entity0 was such an intelligent and charming pupil			2
‘ i think it will die on its feet and be just a seven - day wonder			2
most independent schools are already doing exactly what they are required to do as charities			2
’ mr @entity18 , who said he had ‘ no idea ’ whether mr @entity0 was reflecting his own beliefs or pushing a party line , added that @entity14 had always been ‘ very active in the local community ’ and that during the mp ’s time at the school the boys were involved in charitable activities such as helping the elderly			1
@entity14 has forged links with three local state secondaries and several primaries , including help with @entity74 lessons and offering access to its swimming pool			2
more than nine out of ten independent schools are involved in similar partnerships			0
after mr @entity0 condemned the ‘ @entity84 ’ between private and state education , which he said had created a ‘ corrosive divide of privilege ’ , the current @entity14 headmaster @entity80 fought back by describing the policy as ‘ odious bigotry ’			1
mr @entity80 said : ‘ if mr @entity0 wanted to tastelessly quantify the value of public benefit that @entity14 generates each year then he would find that it far outstrips the value of tax relief			1
’ it triggered a very public war of words between mr @entity0 and the independent school sector			1
some of his political opponents suspected the policy had been rushed out in order to appeal to @entity6 ’s core vote and distract attention from the ‘ snob ’ row over former frontbencher @entity104 ’s @entity103 message showing a flag - covered house in @entity107 with a white van parked outside			0
mr @entity0 attended @entity14 in @entity15 , north @entity110 , pictured , in the late 80s , early 90s yesterday mr @entity0 stoked the row further by pledging a @entity37 would send @entity112 inspectors into private schools to check they were doing enough to help local ones			1
‘ if the militants of independent schools say “ never ” then we will have to think again and @entity112 could be an answer , ’ he said			0
‘ go through some of these schools ’ accounts and it is so hard to find what they have done			0
’ mr @entity0 , whose father is @entity125 , left ucs in 1992 with two as and a b to read history at @entity129 , @entity130			1
last night he said : ‘ the @entity6 remains committed to breaking down the barriers in our education system that stand in the way of opportunity and aspiration for all children			0
‘ we look forward to seeing more meaningful partnerships between state and private schools , and that is what this announcement is all about			2
’ it costs £ 5,462 to turn a new house into a home , according to a new study			0
the research shows that homeowners take weeks putting their stamp on a property before it feels like their own			0
nearly half install a new bathroom or kitchen but , for a third , that moment comes with something as simple as putting up photos			0
getting out the paintbrush is also a rite of passage , while 11 per cent say it ’s when a letter arrives with their new address on , according to the survey by @entity166			0
@entity167 , from the @entity168 , said : ‘ making a property feel like a home is really important			0
it ’s just a shame that it can cost so much			0
