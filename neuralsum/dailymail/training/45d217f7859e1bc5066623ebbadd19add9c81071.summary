by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 12:40 est , 23 september 2013 demolition work on the house where a couple killed their six young children after they set it alight is beginning today			1
the semi-detached house at 18 @entity7 , @entity8 , will be razed to the ground this week , nearly two and a half years after @entity11 and @entity12 's children died in the fire			1
@entity14 , 10 , and her brothers @entity16 , nine , @entity17 , eight , @entity18 , six , and @entity19 , five , died in the blaze in may 2012			1
@entity21 , 13 , died days later in hospital			1
the house at 18 @entity7 in @entity8 will be razed to the ground two and a half years after the fatal blaze a few withered flowers are still pinned to the door of the house which @entity29 , 55 , right , the mother of @entity12 , wants to see demolished - she says her grandchildren 's souls will be at rest when it 's gone @entity21 , 13 , @entity14 , 10 , and her brothers @entity16 , nine , ( lower row ) @entity17 , eight , @entity19 , five and @entity18 , six , died @entity37 flowers are still pinned to the front door of the house where the children died in the fire workmen lower a portable cabin onto the street outside the condemned house in the suburb of @entity47 @entity11 and @entity12 were jailed in april , along with friend @entity12 , after being convicted of killing the couple 's six children in the petrol - fuelled blaze in the suburb of @entity47			1
today mrs @entity12 's mother @entity29 stood outside the house where builders were erecting scaffolding before demolition work begins on the house and the one next to it			1
mrs @entity29 , 55 , said : ' i 'm just here to see it			0
the children will be resting in peace now			2
' the three - bedroom house , which has been boarded up since firefighters put out the flames of the deadly fire in may 2011 , still has withered floral tributes to the children who died pinned to the front door			1
@entity12 was jailed for life with a minimum term of 15 years after being convicted of six counts of manslaughter following a trial at @entity75 earlier this year			1
the trial heard that @entity12 used petrol to set fire to his home in a bid to frame his mistress during a child custody battle			1
tragic : @entity85 , with his six children - he is serving life in prison for their manslaughter ready for demolition : the house at 18 @entity7 , right , and the one next to it will be knocked down this week poignant tributes : withered flowers on the front door of the semi-detached house in @entity8 kind : the companies involved in the demolition have pledged to give their fees to a children 's charity @entity12 and wife @entity12 react during a news conference after their children died in a fire at the house his wife @entity12 and @entity12 were told they would each serve half of a 17 - year sentence for their part in the plan to set fire to the property			1
@entity115 said the process of demolition is likely to take up to three weeks ; one week to prepare the site and a further two weeks to take down both properties , beginning with the outbuildings and roofing structures			0
new social housing is expected to be built on the site in due course			0
the firms involved in the demolition have agreed to donate their fee to @entity126 in @entity127 , which provides disadvantaged local children with holidays in the town			2
no escape : this photograph shows the blackened and charred sitting room of the house just after the fire local councillor @entity136 said : ' i think we all welcome the demolition of these properties			2
' whilst the tragic deaths of the six @entity12 children will never be forgotten , local people continue to move on and this is symbolic of the end of a very difficult time for the community			1
' the deadly blaze in may 2012 was started by @entity12 with the help of wife @entity12 and friend @entity12 while their six children were sleeping upstairs			1
they had hatched an elaborate plot in which @entity11 would save the children and the fire would be blamed on his estranged partner @entity156 , with whom @entity12 was locked in a legal battle for custody of the four children they had together			1
but the idiotic plan went disastrously wrong			0
too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of control – leaving @entity12 unable to reach the children in temperatures approaching @entity166			1
share what you think the comments below have been moderated in advance			0
@entity171 , @entity172 , 22 hours ago they should not build more houses , they should put something community based there to help children and a memorial			2
they can build two new houses elsewhere			0
cupcake , @entity184 , 22 hours ago i 'm sorry and all that but there is a housing crisis ! @entity188 , eastside , 22 hours ago when @entity12 comes out , will he be given a new @entity190 - courtesy of @entity115 - just wondering ? ? ? ? ? @entity191 , 22 hours ago six angels in @entity193			2
i hope their parents never get out of prison maybe someone could lose the cell key			0
@entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , 22 hours ago i think it ´ s incredibly tacky that whoever is demolishing it has put a massive advertising banner on the front			0
@entity12 from @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , 22 hours ago they are going to demolish both semi detached houses ( ie the @entity213 's and the on joined to it ) ? or are they going to demolish just the @entity217 's house alone and make good the exposed party wall with render and the roof of the other house			2
i think it 's right to demolish the @entity217 's house but i do n't think their neighbours should have to lose their home [ whether they are council tennants themselves or indeed own the place ] because of the evil deeds of these children 's parents			2
if the adjacent attached house were my dwelling , i 'd be mighty miffed to have to suffering having it demolished through having had the misfortune of having lived next door to a monsper and his warped spouse			0
@entity238 , south east , @entity210 , 22 hours ago poor children , repulsive parents			0
@entity241 , @entity8 , @entity210 , 22 hours ago the other half of the semi was empty as the owner had died , the council bought the house back			1
both are being demolished and two new houses being built on the site as that is what the residents wanted			0
they did n't want a memorial garden because let 's face it does anyone want the parents going there when they get out of prison ? new housing is far better			0
@entity261 , @entity260 , 23 hours ago why destroy a perfectly good home - why not just restyle it , reshape the front or build an extension so that it looks visibly different			0
@entity265 , @entity266 , @entity210 , 23 hours ago i hope mairead is too old to have any more kids when she is released			0
