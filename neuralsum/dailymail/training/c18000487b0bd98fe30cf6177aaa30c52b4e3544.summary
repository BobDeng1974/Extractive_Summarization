@entity1 senator @entity0 admonished president @entity2 today for going behind @entity4 's back to get missing soldier @entity5 released			1
@entity0 said @entity2 ' did n't follow the law ' when he unilaterally made the decision to release five @entity9 detainees with ties to the @entity11 in exchange for sgt. @entity5			1
' we have a law in this country , it says you have to notify [ @entity4 ] within in 30 days , ' @entity0 , a @entity13 on the @entity15 's @entity14 , told @entity21			1
' he completely ignored it			0
' sen. @entity0 , pictured here at a rally for @entity13 senatorial candidate @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , told @entity21 on tuesday that @entity2 ' ignored ' the law when he went around @entity4 to negotiate @entity5 's release the @entity29 requires the executive branch to give @entity4 30 days notice before it frees prisoners from @entity9			1
in the case of the @entity5 trade , members of @entity4 received notice just hours before the deal was to occur			1
president @entity2 tried to play down the significance of his administration 's actions today , saying at a press conference in @entity42 , @entity43 , this morning that @entity4 knew his office was considering a trade for ' quite some time ' before it happened			1
members of @entity4 dispute that claim			2
' i do n’t know what he means by consulted @entity4 for some time , ' @entity48 chairman @entity47 , a @entity13 , told @entity51 this morning			1
' in 2011 , they did come up and present a plan that included a prisoner transfer that was , in a bipartisan way , pushed back			0
' we had n’t heard anything since on any details of any prisoner exchange , ' he said			0
house speaker @entity60 backed up his colleague 's timeline of events this afternoon , saying in a statement that more than two years ago the administration had a discussion with members of @entity4 about a trade , but ' the administration deferred further engagement because the prospects of the exchange had diminished			2
' ' the administration provided assurances , publicly reiterated by the @entity75 in june 2013 , that its engagement with @entity4 would resume if the prospects for an exchange became credible again , ' @entity60 said , adding that ' the only reason it did not is because the administration knew it faced serious and sober bipartisan concern and opposition			1
' @entity14 chairwoman @entity83 offered reporters a similar version of events , saying that when the administration approached the @entity75 and @entity89 in 2011 ' there were very strong views and they were virtually unanimous against the trade			0
' ' the notification to us is important and i think that it would have been a much better thing to do because you do try to work together , ' @entity83 said			0
@entity83 said deputy national security adviser @entity96 called her last night to beg pardon for not notifying her of the trade sooner			0
' he apologized and said it was an oversight , ' the @entity100 senator said after her party 's weekly policy luncheon			2
' the notification to us is important and i think that it would have been a much better thing to do because you do try to work together , ' @entity14 chairwoman @entity83 told reporters today after the @entity100 's policy luncheon administration officials say the @entity75 kept the swap secret to ensure @entity5 's safety , but republicans are questioning the accuracy of that claim			1
' the administration has invited serious questions into how this exchange went down and the calculations the @entity75 and relevant agencies made in moving forward without consulting @entity4 despite assurances it would re-engage with members on both sides of the aisle , ' speaker @entity60 said today			2
@entity2 did n't notify members of @entity4 about the trade until it was happening , < ! -- / * @entity126 * / @ font - face { font - family : " @entity129 " ; panose - 1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4 ; } @ font - face { font - family : " @entity132 " ; panose - 1:2 11 5 2 4 2 4 2 2 3 ; } / * style definitions * / @entity133 , @entity135 , @entity136 { margin - top : 0in ; margin - right : 0in ; margin - bottom : 8.0pt ; margin - left : 0in ; line - height : 107 % ; font - size : 11.0pt ; font - family : " @entity142 " , " sans - serif " ; }			2

it 's a near certainty that @entity2 knew about the swap when he secretly had former secretary of state and presumed 2016 presidential candidate @entity161 over for lunch two days before @entity5 's release			1
@entity165 sen. @entity164 told @entity166 it would be ' fair game ' to ask @entity168 if she did indeed know about the trade before it took place			0
' this has ramifications long term for the @entity156 , this prisoner swap , ' he said			0
' if mrs. @entity161 remains politically active , people will want to know what her advice was on the subject , ' @entity177 sen. @entity176 , who sits on the @entity178 , told @entity166			0
if @entity2 did tell @entity168 , ' it would be outrageous that he notified someone who 's outside government before he would even notify members of @entity4 , including the chairwoman of the @entity14 , for example , or the @entity189 , for that matter , ' @entity0 told @entity21			1
a spokesman for the @entity192 would n't tell @entity166 what @entity2 and @entity168 discussed at lunch , and @entity168 's spokesman ignored reporters ' requests for comment on @entity5 today			1
asked at a lecture about @entity5 yesterday , @entity168 said @entity2 faced a ' tough ' decision and its one she dares not question			2
' i do n't believe in second guessing people who have to make these hard choices , ' @entity168 said .			0

*lawmakers* are upset with president @entity2 for going around their back to get sgt. @entity5 released
the president violated a law requiring him to give @entity4 30 days notice before releasing prisoners from @entity9 , @entity13 say
' he completely ignored it . he 's gone rogue , ' @entity1 @entity13 sen. @entity0 told @entity21
the @entity75 has since apologized for the ' oversight '
