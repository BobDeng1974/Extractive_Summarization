by @entity0 published : 13:01 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 13:01 est , 7 june 2013 astronomers in the @entity2 have , for the first time , observed a comet factory around a young star			1
particles around the young star grow by clumping together , solving a long - standing mystery about how dust particles in discs form comets or planets			1
the ‘ dust trap ’ was found by @entity13 , a phd student at @entity14 using the new @entity15 ( @entity15 )			1
this artist 's impression shows the dust trap in the system @entity21 48			2
the dust trap provides a safe haven for the tiny rocks in the disc , allowing them to clump together and grow to sizes that allow them to survive on their own earlier observations using @entity31 ’s @entity30 had already shown that the small dust particles also form a similar ring structure			1
but the @entity15 view of where the larger dust particles were found was very different			2
‘ at first , the shape of the dust in the image was a complete surprise for us , ’ said van der @entity13			0
‘ instead of the ring we had expected to see , we found a very clear cashew - nut shape			0
' we had to convince ourselves that this feature was real , but the strong signal and sharpness of the @entity15 observations left no doubt about the structure			0
suddenly we realised what we had found			0
’ the ' dust trap ' was observed by @entity13 , a phd student at @entity14 in the @entity2 using the new @entity15 ( @entity15 )			1
earlier observations using @entity31 's @entity30 had already shown that the small dust particles also form a similar ring structure @entity13 saw an area circled by a ring of gas with a central hole that was probably created by an unseen planet or companion star			2
what had been discovered was a region where bigger dust grains were trapped and could grow much larger by colliding and sticking together			0
this was a dust trap - just what the theorists were looking for			2
‘ it ’s likely that we are looking at a kind of comet factory because the particles can grow in this dust trap up to cometary sizes of a few kilometres , ’ said @entity13			1
artist 's impression of the proposed disk structure of @entity78 48			0
the brown spots represent the large and small grains			0
the larger grains detected by @entity15 are concentrated in the dust trap at the bottom of the image			1
the blue represents the distribution of carbon monoxide gas			0
the gap in is shown with the proposed planetary body that is sweeping the area clear and providing the conditions necessary to form the dust trap ‘ the dust is not likely to form full - sized planets at this distance from the star			1
but in the near future @entity15 will be able to observe dust traps closer to their parent stars , where the same mechanisms are at work			2
‘ such dust traps really would be the cradles for new - born planets			0
’ the dust trap forms as bigger dust particles move in the direction of higher pressure			1
separate computer models have shown that such a high pressure region can originate from the motions of the gas at the edge of a gas hole - just like the one found in this disc			0
‘ around the time that these observations were obtained , we were working on models predicting exactly these kinds of structures : a very lucky coincidence , ’ said @entity117 from the @entity118 in @entity119			0
this image from @entity15 shows the dust trap in the disc that surrounds the system @entity128 48			1
the dust trap provides a safe haven for tiny particles in the disc , allowing them to clump together and grow to sizes that allow them to survive on their own the green region shows where the larger particles are located ( millimetre - sized ) and is the dust trap seen discovered by @entity15			1
the orange ring shows observations of much finer dust particles ( micron - sized ) using the @entity144 instrument on @entity31 's @entity30			0

astronomers in the @entity2 have , for the first time , observed what they believe to be a comet factory
the ' dust trap ' clumps particles together in space to form comets or planets
