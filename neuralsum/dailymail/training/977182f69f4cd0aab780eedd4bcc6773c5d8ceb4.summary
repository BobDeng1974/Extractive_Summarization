defeat has seldom tasted so sweet			2
the king might not necessarily still be the king but he is definitely back and ready to fight to reclaim his crown			0
that was the reaction from the @entity6 team as the horse still rated the best steeplechaser in @entity9 finished three - lengths second to @entity10 in the grade one @entity11 at @entity12			1
jockey @entity13 and trainer @entity14 could be accused of peering through rose - tinted spectacles but , equally , they also had a heap of reasons to view the run with a healthy dose of optimism			1
this was , after all , @entity6 ’s first run for 386 days and his first voyage into competitive action since being pulled up at @entity26 13 months ago with a heart problem that threatened to end the career of the seven - time grade one winning chaser			1
dodging @entity10 ( left ) beats @entity6 in the @entity32 @entity31 at @entity12 @entity6 struggles to close the gap on dodging bullets as @entity35 pulls clear on the winner there were also concerns that the frightening experience may have left a mental scare on 2013 @entity41 winner , whose jumping got noticeably more exuberant as the race progressed			1
it was hardly surprising a noticeable nervous hush shrouded the parade ring before the two - mile contest which was replaced after it by a rush of relief , most notably from the trainer and not diluted by the subsequent news that the nine - year - old had suffered a ‘ low level ’ bleed from the nose after veterinary examination			2
@entity14 , who had agonised all week about running @entity6 on ground he feared would be worse than the eventual @entity61 going , said : ’ we are not trying to sweep that under the carpet but do not think ( the bleed ) is significant			1
@entity14 , trainer of @entity6 , said his horse ' travelled well but got a little bit tired ' at @entity12 ‘ he proved it is still there			1
i have seen lots of positive			0
he just got a bit tired			0
‘ you would not send your player out and play 90 minutes first time out			0
you would probably take him off after 60			0
‘ this morning i would have taken that ( result ) and , turning for home , i thought i was going to take a bit better ‘ it was still a great performance because it has been hard work			0
in october and november , we were n’t exactly blooming but things are coming together at the right time			0
we are on the right road and i am fairly optimistic about that			0
’ dodging @entity10 leads from the front early on with @entity6 and @entity13 giving chase hopes of an immediate return to winning ways have been elevated when @entity6 loomed up seeming to be travelling best on the home turn			1
but eventual fourth @entity89 and @entity90 had set out make this two - mile contest as big a test of stamina as possible and it worked			2
@entity94 had @entity6 in front before the second last fence but @entity98 - trained , @entity35 - ridden @entity97 winner @entity99 had overtaken him strides after it and @entity94 was never going to ask his mount too serious a question in the in finals hard yards			1
@entity94 said : ‘ all of a sudden i felt him tread water a bit			0
but he is bound to get tired , he has been off a year and we went a really good gallop			1
@entity94 admits he was beaten fair and square but is confident today 's run will help @entity6 improve ‘ we were beaten fair and square on the day but you ’d imagine with a run under his belt he will improve			2
bar winning , i could not be any happier			0
’ sponsors betway now make @entity6 3 - 1 joint favourite with 2014 winner @entity116 for this season ’s renewal at the @entity119 in march			1
the latter must himself prove he has recovered from an injury in the @entity123 at @entity124 on february 7			0
@entity94 was more than happy with the way @entity6 performed on the @entity12 track after a lay - off			2

@entity6 was sent off 4 - 6 favourite to win the race
but the @entity98 ' trained @entity10 prevailed by three lengths
@entity14 admits he was *pleased* with how @entity6 travelled
but the trainer admitted the really good gallop caught him out in the end
