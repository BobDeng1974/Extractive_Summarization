on sunday evening , an asteroid the size of a house soared past the @entity3 and may have released shards of meteorite into our atmosphere			1
one such fragment is believed to have created a crater 39 - ft wide ( 20 metres ) in @entity10 - but what would have happened if the asteroid itself had struck the @entity3 ? the @entity15 project was set up to answer such questions , and calculates how far and wide the spread of damage would be if a space rock collided with our planet			1
using a @entity28 plugin , the interactive calculator lets users select the type of projectile , either a comet or asteroid , as well as its size ; small , medium and large			1
for the purposes of the project , the small asteroid is listed as the size of a school bus , around 8ft ( 2.4 metres ) wide , and made of iron			1
the medium , stony asteroid is listed as being three times the size of a football field , approximately 1,080 ft ( 329 metres )			1
while the large asteroid is listed as 6,336ft wide ( 1,931 metres ) and travelling at approximately 12miles a second ( 20km )			2
the small ‘ miniature icy ’ comet in the simulation is 360ft wide ( 109 metres ) and is moving at 30 miles a second ( 50km )			2
the medium comet is also made of ice and is travelling at 30 miles a second ( 50km ) , but is 3,166ft ( 965 metres ) wide			2
the largest icy comet in the project is 31,680ft ( 9,656 metres )			1
users can select any of these projectiles , before choosing from one of 15 locations			0
the project was funded by @entity24 ’s @entity23 ( @entity23 ) and @entity25			1

users can select any of these projectiles , before choosing from one of 15 locations where the impact will take place			0
alternatively , they can select a random location			0
after pressing ' go ' , a simulated animation is shown hitting the chosen location , with a warning about the aftermath			0
for example , a large comet crashing into @entity94 in @entity95 would throw enough debris into the air to ‘ darken the skies			0
’ the map reveals that this kind of projectile could cause an ‘ extinction event ’ , that is said to have killed off the dinosaurs , but ‘ happily these may only occur every billion years or so			1
’ a small asteroid hitting @entity107 would create a crater that spreads past @entity109 in the west , and @entity111 in the east			1
buildings as far south as @entity114 would fall over , but the impact would only affect those in this range			0
this simulation shows the impact a medium asteroid hitting @entity107 would create			1
people in @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and up to @entity124 would suffer first degree burns			0
residents of @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 would have their clothes set on fire			0
steel buildings would be destroyed as far west as @entity133 and the crater would decimate the entire central @entity107 a large comet hitting @entity137 , for example , would create devastation across the east coast of the @entity140 , and people in @entity142 and @entity143 in @entity144 would suffer first degree burns alternatively , a medium asteroid hitting the same spot would spread much further			1

all of these estimates were based on calculations devised by professor @entity159 and his team at @entity161 , @entity107			2
his online calculator lets users customise the size and speed of projectiles			0
using the size of the asteroid 2014 @entity169 ( pictured ) , and making estimations about its speed , angle and density , if it was to hit @entity3 it would begin to breakup at an altitude of 207,000 ft ( 63100 metres )			1
the air blast would arrive approximately 1.17 minutes after impact and sound intensity would be @entity180 , or as loud as heavy traffic if you were stood a kilometre away			0
the asteroid was reported as passing closest to earth at approximately 7.18pm bst ( 2.18pm est ) over @entity185 on sunday one meteorite , believed to have been a shard of the asteroid 2014 @entity169 , created a crater 39 - ft wide ( 20 metres ) in @entity10 ( pictured )			2
the meteorite , which may have splintered from the asteroid , is said to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight , and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments @entity196 's organisation uses to measure earthquakes using the size of the asteroid 2014 @entity169 , and making estimations about its speed , angle and density , if it was to hit @entity3 it would begin to breakup at an altitude of 207,000 ft ( 63100 metres )			1
it would burst into a cloud of fragments at an altitude of 75,700 ft ( 23,100 metres )			0
the air blast would arrive approximately 1.17 minutes after impact and sound intensity would be @entity180 , or as loud as heavy traffic if you were stood a kilometre away			0
the asteroid was reported as passing closest to earth at approximately 7.18pm bst ( 2.18pm est ) , as it travelled over @entity185 on sunday			0
it did not hit @entity3 , but its orbit will bring it back to our planet 's neighbourhood in the future			2
the asteroid 's future motion will be closely monitored , but no future threatening @entity3 encounters have been identified , according to @entity25 .			1

the @entity15 project was funded by @entity24 ’s @entity23 ( @entity23 ) and @entity25
it calculates the damage that would be created by a comet or asteroid hitting @entity3
these calculations are based on the weight , size and velocity of the projectile , as well as its density
interactive map reveals how far the impact would *stretch* , and the radius of people who would be affected
