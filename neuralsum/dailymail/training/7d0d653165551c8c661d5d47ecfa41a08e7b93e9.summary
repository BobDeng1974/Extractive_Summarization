by @entity0 published : 12:13 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 13:35 est , 29 july 2013 @entity1 , 59 , has lost her fight to get more money from her ex-husband - 21 years after they divorced a financial agony aunt left penniless and on the brink of homelessness has lost her fight to get more money from the man she divorced two decades ago			1
@entity1 , 59 , used to advise women 's magazine readers about how to manage their money but found herself destitute only months after ex-husband @entity15 sold his business for £ 2.6million			1
the couple had been divorced for ' longer than most people are married ' , the @entity17 heard			0
mr @entity1 had given his wife £ 24,000 - a - year since their 1992 divorce for living costs and to help bring up their children			1
but a judge ruled that the couple should sever their financial ties after mr @entity1 , also 59 , sold his wealth management business last year			1
@entity31 decided that mrs @entity32 , who now runs a not - for - profit education through arts business , should receive her future maintenance as a £ 300,000 lump sum in instalments			1
her appeal against the judge 's decision was today rejected at the @entity41			2
lord @entity42 said : ' there should be a clean break - they have been divorced longer than most people are married			0
' this couple have got to put an end to this war			0
they have got to get on with their lives			0
he continued : ' when this marriage ended , there was nothing , all of the husband ’s wealth was built up again post-separation ... she ca n’t expect to enjoy the standard of living which she would have had if they had stayed married			2
' mrs @entity32 ' barrister @entity65 accused mr @entity1 of not fully disclosing what he is worth and said his client would be left with almost nothing to live on before her next payment arrives next year			1
the court heard that , as the lump sum is to be paid in instalments , mrs @entity32 ' maintenance stands at only five pence a year before her money arrives			1
she faces losing her @entity75 home in @entity78 's @entity77 , mr @entity65 said , and would be left with almost nothing to live on after paying off mortgage arrears			1
mr @entity65 said that judge @entity82 's original ruling had effectively asked mrs @entity32 to live on about £ 50 - a - week in the meantime			1
' what is she supposed to live on in these intervening months ? ' mr @entity65 asked the court			0
' the judge knew she was facing repossession proceedings , he had seen the paperwork			0
she is likely to lose her property and that is her home			0
' mrs @entity32 her ex-husband lived together for a decade , but were married for only a few years before they were divorced in 1992			1
the businessman , of @entity95 , near @entity96 , turned his financial services business , @entity98 into a success following the divorce , counting the @entity101 among its clients			2
for years , he made payments to make sure that his ex had enough money to live on and to pay towards their children ’s upkeep and school fees			0
but , with the sale of his business looming , judge @entity82 consolidated her future payments into the £ 300,000 lump sum , to be paid in three instalments , over two years , at each stage of the sale			2
at the @entity17 , mr @entity65 argued that judge @entity82 ’s assessment of how much mrs @entity32 should get was flawed , since nobody knew exactly what her ex-husband is now worth			1
a judge at the @entity17 today upheld last year 's decision to restrict mrs @entity32 's maintenance to a £ 300,000 lump sum he had admitted an approximate £ 230,000 - a - year income , but had made provision for a tax bill of almost £ 200,000 , suggesting his true income was much higher than that , the barrister said			1
a sales agreement showed details of his corporate clients , but did not disclose anything about his private clients , which could have provided him with another £ 500,000 - a - year in income , he claimed			2
' mr @entity1 continually delayed and delayed and delayed			2
he downright refused to - or just did n’t - produce any of the details of the assets held jointly with his partner			0
' that information just is n’t available , ' mr @entity65 said			0
' it was always the appellant ’s case that there was not full disclosure by her ex-husband			0
' so , when the judge made a decision about what he could or could not afford , he did n’t have a clear picture of what mr @entity1 was worth			1
' giving judgment , @entity153 refused permission for an appeal against the amount mrs @entity32 will eventually get , but granted leave to appeal the way that the money is to be paid			1
he continued : ' the wife has been left in the position under his order that she is required , in effect , to subsist throughout the remainder of this year with virtually no income at all			0
' i think that it is at least reasonably arguable that that involves an exercise of discretion which does n’t adequately take into account the unfairness to the wife			0
' mr @entity1 was neither present , nor represented , during the @entity174			2
no date was set for the full hearing of his ex-wife ’s appeal .			0

@entity1 and @entity15 , both 59 , ended their marriage in 1992
he paid £ 24,000 - a - year to help with *lifestyle* and bringing up their children
a judge ruled they should sever financial ties and decision has been upheld
ruling came after mr @entity1 sold wealth management business for £ 2.6m
mrs @entity32 's barrister said his client faced losing her @entity77 home
