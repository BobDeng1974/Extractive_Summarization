by @entity0 published : 08:33 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 12:27 est , 17 july 2012 as a tourism chief battling one of the soggiest summers on record , @entity1 might be excused for cursing the heavens above			1
perhaps surprisingly , however , he also has a more earthly target			0
for mr @entity1 does n’t just blame the weather for putting a dampener on his year , but also the weathermen and women who predict it			1
and the unusually heavy rainfall has given forecasters plenty of opportunity to deliver the depressing news			1
gloomy : @entity51 chief @entity1 says forecasters delight in bringing news of rain june was one of the wettest on record in the @entity58 , with torrential rainfall causing floods in many areas around the country , and the april - june quarter was the wettest second quarter in the @entity58 since records began in 1910			1
and now even river - based activities have been affected by the downpours			0
the latest casualty of the wet weather is the annual ceremony of @entity71			1
the historic event - a census of swans - has been cancelled for the entire week for the first time in hundreds of years because of the flooded @entity76			1
the event dates from the twelfth century and should have started yesterday and lasted until friday			0
but an announcement last night said it had been cancelled because of the dangerous state of the river			0
danger warnings are in place along most of the @entity76 from @entity83 to @entity84 advising boats to keep off the river because of the strong stream following recent heavy rain			1
the @entity89 ’s @entity88 said : ' it is very disappointing but navigation warnings are in force along the river and we can not take chances			0
' the royal @entity71 in colourful traditional uniforms travel the river in rowing boats from @entity98 in @entity18 to @entity99 on @entity84 taking a census of swans , checking their health and marking young birds			0
warming up : sunbathers enjoy the sunny weather on @entity106 - but it was not quite bikini weather warm : blue sky peeps through the clouds above @entity20 drawing sunbathers and holidaymakers to the shore splashing around : @entity114 , four , splashes in the sea on @entity42 beach in @entity117 today the @entity89 still retains the right to ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water , but only exercises her ownership on certain stretches of the @entity76 and surrounding tributaries			1
the deluges have also led to the need for regular use of the largest plughole in the world in @entity130 in @entity131			0
it was built to prevent the reservoir from breaking its banks by creating a whirlpool on the surface , sucking the water down and through a valve house at the bottom of the dam			0
commonly referred to as a plughole , it measures 24 metres in diameter and is one of two in the three - mile long reservoir , which is the lowest of three reservoirs in the @entity150 area of the @entity151			0
a huge chunk of road has been swept away in a landlside just weeks after it was relaid at @entity155 in @entity156 @entity157 up : a graffiti artist in @entity159 makes his feelings known about the @entity58 summer the @entity51 chief believes their ‘ flippant remarks ’ could cost the economy millions in lost revenue from tourism , and he says colleagues at other resorts , including @entity170 and @entity171 , agree			1
‘ rather than help the public in these difficult and austere times to have at least some comfort and pleasure in their holidays and free times , they seem obsessed with making them even more depressed , ’ he said			1
‘ i despair when weather presenters all too often seem to delight and get excited about poor weather and skip over the periods of fair weather			1
’ presenters gloss over the details of the forecast , he said , leaving viewers uncertain whether they face a day of downpours or one of ten - minute showers			2
mr @entity1 said the tourism industry in @entity51 could lose as much as £ 60million this summer , after the wettest april to june on record			1
performers from the @entity194 wait in the rain before a rehearsal at the @entity197 fowl weather : the traditional @entity71 ceremony has had to be cancelled because of flooding along the @entity76 he said june ’s rain alone brought a fall of around 20 per cent in custom for some businesses			1
and he believes throwaway remarks by tv weather presenters who ‘ try to be stand - up comics ’ are the problem			1
he said : ‘ they say things like “ we ’ll have our wellies on until october ” or confuse showers , which can last ten minutes , with a rainy day and put people off			0
’ the @entity217 said weather reporters permanently based at media organisations including the @entity220 tend to follow house styles set by the broadcasters			2
carrying the flame : dame @entity224 with the @entity226 torch at @entity227 ‘ i do n’t think anyone would disagree when we say that the weather so far this june and the early part of july has been rather disappointing , ’ it said , adding that it worked with the tourist industry to provide localised forecasts for resorts and attractions			2
one thing which – for the moment at least – seems to be ignoring mr @entity1 ’s plea for good news is the weather itself , with the @entity245 seeing more torrential rain yesterday			1
parts of @entity51 have had more than 100mm of rain so far this july , compared with an average expectation of just under 70mm for the entire month			1
elsewhere , a coastal road was literally washed away at @entity155 in @entity156 , while @entity252 was flooded for the second time this year after the @entity254 burst its banks			0
an annual sheep fair in @entity257 that has been running for more than six centuries has been cancelled for the first time ever due to weather			2
the event , due to have been held on 22 august , would have been the 664th @entity262			0
the fair has been held every year since 1348 , apart from in 2001 and 2007 because of foot - and - mouth disease			0
@entity265 , chairman of the @entity266 , said cancelling it had been ' a really tough decision to take '			0
the fair moved from @entity269 to the @entity271 village in 1348 because of the @entity272 , although evidence has been found of a fair being held in @entity274 before that			0
organisers said it would take several weeks of fine weather to dry the ground out mr @entity265 added : ' we had a realistic look at all the options that were available to us but , in the end , the safety of our helpers and visitors attending the fair had to come first			1
' we must also consider that the other fields we use are based on the goodwill of the landowners , who allow their land to be used for free , but do n’t want to see the fields turned to mud			0
' meanwhile , a farmer who set up a company selling vegetable boxes has suspended his business ' indefinitely ' after weeks of heavy rainfall left fields flooded			0
the @entity299 of @entity300 , @entity156 , was created four years ago and has delivered up to 220 boxes every week			2
but the weather , along with an unfavourably long growing season in 2011 and increased fuel costs mean it has been losing £ 2,500 a month			2
on the road : it managed to stay dry as @entity307 ran with the @entity308 at @entity309 , pictured , with a view of the @entity312 cliffs behind her shelter from the storm : students in @entity317 brave the conditions as they arrive for their graduations founder @entity320 , 29 , said he now intends to concentrate on his wholesale vegetable business			2
mr @entity320 told customers : ' i have farmed all my life but i can honestly say this year has been the worst year in my career for growing horticultural produce			0
' he said that a mild winter meant crops had been harvested months earlier than normal , leaving almost nothing left for the spring			0
he added : ' everything has either been drowned by rain or is not growing through lack of sun. it ’s very sad			2
' but we are not the only guys in this situation , all over the place growers are struggling and horticultural crops are failing left right and centre			0
' but there is some good news on the way - @entity58 is finally expected to get drier and warmer next week			1
@entity343 , a forecaster with @entity344 , the @entity345 ’s weather division , said : ' we will get high pressure building to the west , and it looks like that ’s going to give us a couple of dry days on friday and saturday			1
' it looks like there ’s going to be high pressure across the south of the @entity58 , so it looks like it ’s going to be generally drier next week			1
but northern areas will see some rain , particularly northern @entity359			2
' it looks like southern areas can expect some drier and warmer weather			2
it ’s more like average summer conditions and weather we would expect			0
