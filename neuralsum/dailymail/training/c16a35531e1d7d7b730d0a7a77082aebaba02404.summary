when it comes to naming those in need of fat treatment the winner of @entity6 @entity5 does not immediately spring to mind			2
@entity8 may not be the most likely candidate for having body issues , but the model has recently undergone a £ 600 fat - freezing treatment to tone her thighs to get in shape for her 2015 calendar shoot			1
the i 'm a @entity18 star went on two month campaign to drop the weight gained due to eating carbs to train for @entity22 , in order to look toned and trim for her latest swim - wear shoot			1
@entity8 revealed that she was n't her usual svelte self because the carb heavy diet that her marathon trainer had put her on prior to the race had made her pile on some weight			2
' just a short while after i had run the marathon i was still not back to my usual figure when i did a swim - wear photo shoot at @entity36 ' said the 22 - year - old			1
@entity8 had been left feeling insecure after she was called a ' whale ' following her bikini shoot at the @entity36 earlier this year @entity8 says that it was the abuse on @entity52 that motivated her to get back into shape ' bizarrely , i actually put weight on when i was training for the @entity56 marathon			1
i was carb - loading because i was burning so much energy in training but it did n't help my figure			0
' @entity8 says that she does not regret doing the race whatsoever but she was eager to shed some of the weight she had gained			1
' i am really happy that i took part and raised a lot of money for the @entity67 charity , but afterwards i needed to go back to what i know – eating healthy and regular gym sessions			0
' @entity8 was pictured standing in giant scallop shell was meant to recreate the classic @entity71 painting @entity72 , but instead it received a barrage of abuse on @entity52 with people calling her ' huge ' and ' a whale '			1
@entity8 says that it was the harsh comments that left her motivated enough to get back to her slender self			0
the @entity81 works by ' freezing fat ' causing cells to crystallise and die ' i did a photo shoot at @entity36 and i received some really nasty comments on twitter			1
i do n't think i have ever had such negative criticism before , but i did n't let the twitter trolls bother me and in fact i used that criticism as motivation to get in even better shape and now i 'm the best shape i 've ever been in			0
' although the model was hugely driven to lose the weight she admitted that a it was a fat - freezing process that gave her the helping hand she needed			1
' i 'd also heard about the @entity81 fat - freezing treatment from friends who told me it kills off fat cells			1
they said it had worked for them and that it was pain - free so i thought why not ? ' i work out regularly but i sometimes find it hard to shift the weight off of my thighs so i thought it would be good to have a bit of extra help in spot reduction of fat in that area			2
' @entity116 of the @entity118 clinic ( pictured ) says that even the skinniest of girls can have trouble shifting that extra wobble @entity8 had the treatment at @entity117 in @entity124 a few weeks after @entity36			1
the 60 - minute treatment was for her upper thighs and has been seen to reduce fat deposits by up to 59 % in just one session			2
a protective gauze is placed on the body area which is then gently sucked into the treatment head which then slightly heats the skin for five minutes before slowly reducing the skin temperature to minus @entity134			0
at this temperature fat cells crystallise and die , and then naturally waste away through the body 's renal system over the next 6 - 8 weeks			0
@entity8 could n't wait to see the results and took to @entity52 to share her excitement			2
' was so worried about trying @entity141 but it did n't hurt at all ! yay @ @entity144 awesome job ca n't wait to track the results x ' despite having been motivated to lose weight , @entity8 insists that she was in no way bullied into it and says she did it purely for her own benefit			2
' i would never try to lose weight because people told me i have to			0
it 's all about how you feel in yourself - bullies should not dictate how you live			0
' @entity156 , director of the @entity118 clinic in @entity124 , says that even the skinniest of models can sometimes have a little cellulite that ca n't be shifted			0
' even super fit girls like @entity8 have that little bit of fat that just wo n't budge , regardless of how much exercise they do			0
' ' that 's where @entity166 comes in – it destroys those stubborn fat cells that would otherwise have taken years of hard work to break down			0

@entity8 gained weight while training for the @entity22
she was *subjected* to @entity52 abuse after her @entity36 shoot
