‘ the first thing i notice is that she wipes her lips with a tissue like there is something annoying her , she is wiping it more than if there was just something on her mouth			0
‘ she carries on working and there are certain frames where she touches her face , rubs her chest around her stomach			0
open verdict : mrs @entity8 had confided in friends that her husband abused her and would ' kill her ' if she asked for a divorce , @entity35 heard ‘ towards the end of the day she appears as if she is getting ready to leave with everybody but she appears to fall against the doorframe			1
