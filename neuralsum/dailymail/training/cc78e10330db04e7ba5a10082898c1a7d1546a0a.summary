as a @entity4 model , @entity1 cover girl and socialite @entity0 is seemingly living the supermodel dream			1
but her enviable lifestyle and stellar success is bittersweet because @entity0 , 24 , is also a mother who 's regularly forced to leave her son behind when she jets around the world for work			1
the @entity13 model has a five - year - old named @entity14 and has revealed she was envious of her mother spending so much time with him when she first began working internationally			1
but it works for me			0
' you can find the balance of being a working mother , but i could n't do it without my mum			2
she is the one who allowed me to go and do my thing			0
' the catwalk star also claims other models could n't relate to her at first because they did n't understand her commitments as a mother			1
@entity0 added : ' i love that one day i am doing this and then i go home to my reality : getting @entity14 ready for school , doing his reading with him , taking him to the park			2
' for some in this industry their life is their work			0
the other girls did n't understand in the beginning why i did n't want to go out all the time			0
' @entity0 , who was scouted in her local @entity54 at the tender age of 15 , fell pregnant aged 18 and after giving birth to her son @entity14 , his father was arrested for possession of cocaine			2
@entity0 fell pregnant aged 18 and her son @entity14 is now five and often cared for by @entity0 's mother the catwalk star also claims other models could n't relate to her at first because they did n't understand her commitments as a mother			1
she and @entity67 are , however , fiercely close @entity0 was in a predicament , left alone to balance her increasingly successful working life with her flailing personal life			2
and things did n't get any easier for the mother from @entity73 after @entity14 was diagnosed with sickle - cell anaemia , an inherited , noncontagious blood disorder			2
the disorder leaves sufferers with a shorter life expectancy and periods of sickle - cell crisis that last a few days and require serious medication and hospitalisation			0
although @entity86 does n't have the disease herself , she and the father of her son are among the 250,000 people in @entity90 estimated to carry the genetic mutation that causes it			0
@entity0 posted her first @entity1 cover to her @entity95 account and revealed her joy at becoming the first solo black model to grace the cover of @entity1 for more than 12 years @entity0 poses alongside her @entity13 model pals ( l - r ) @entity100 , @entity0 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 ) in matching leather jackets ahead of the show in december speaking to the @entity108 at the time , the model said : ' i found out i carried it when i was pregnant , which was a huge shock			1
' the first time @entity14 had a crisis , i was working in @entity114 and due to travel to @entity116			0
mum was amazing and reassured me he was in the best hands and that i should keep working			0
' @entity14 has to take penicillin and folic acid daily and @entity0 worries that more awareness should be raised about the disease			2
she said : ' it 's something people do n't really know about , due to the fact it 's genetic , so it does n't have the high profile of @entity127 or malaria , ' @entity14 looks just like a normal boy , but i ca n't get away from the fact he has a serious disease			0
' @entity0 intends to use her status as a famous model to help garner more support for the @entity135 , which she strongly supports			1
taking it in her stride , @entity0 has powered through life and juggled her thriving modelling career with the demands of being a single parent			2
@entity0 's career highlights include walking for the super-cool @entity144 show , left , and @entity13 , right the modelling world has been extremely accommodating of @entity0 's decision to be a mother first and a model second , with @entity149 even making her a special pregnancy catwalk outfit for a show			1
last week , @entity0 was revealed as the first solo black model to grace the cover of @entity1 for more than 12 years			1
the 24 - year - old @entity154 shared the cover image of the fashion magazine on @entity95 to her 954,000 followers after speculation on @entity159 today			0
she wrote : ' i 'm so happy to finally say i 'm on the cover of @entity1 ! ! ! ' she added : ' thank you @entity163 and @entity164 for making this happen and also thank you all for the @entity166 and support it means everything to me # 2015yearofthedunn			0
' although this is her first solo @entity1 cover , @entity0 did previously front the magazine in 2008 along with @entity172 and @entity173			1
this also marks a change for the fashion bible as it is the first time they have featured a solo black model on the cover since @entity180 appeared in 2002			1
@entity0 has enjoyed a highly successful career so far and has been the face of @entity4 beauty along with @entity67 and @entity184 this is the latest in a string of good news for the model			1
at the beginning of last month she took a highly successful turn on the @entity13 runway as the show hit @entity154 for the first time			0
then in mid-december it was revealed that @entity0 and @entity180 were the faces of @entity4 's @entity196 campaign			1
she said of the shoot : ' this campaign is even more special for me because i was shot with @entity180 for the first time - someone who i admire and respect within the fashion industry			0
' she is also a firm favourite on the fashion party circuit counting @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 amongst her close friends			0
