by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:01 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 05:52 est , 27 november 2013 @entity2 launched an astonishing attack on the @entity4 over the @entity6 affair last night – after a 12 - month inquiry concluded there was insufficient evidence that a @entity11 police officer had lied			1
the former @entity13 chief whip named pc @entity14 – with whom he clashed in @entity17 – branding him a serial liar and demanding that he repeat his claims that he used the word ‘ plebs ’ on oath			1
mr @entity2 flatly denies claims by the officer that he used the word after he was stopped cycling through the street ’s gates last september			1
@entity2 ( pictured with his wife dr @entity27 ) has said he ntends to bring @entity28 to ' justice ' and re-instate his reputation his denunciation came as prosecutors yesterday decided a single officer should face trial following a mammoth police investigation , which involved taking more than 1,100 statements			2
@entity15 @entity37 , 53 , was charged with misconduct in a public office over allegations he falsely claimed he witnessed the row			0
five officers from the @entity4 ’s @entity43 , including @entity37 , will now face gross misconduct hearings for discreditable conduct , meaning they could lose their jobs			0
three others will face less serious disciplinary proceedings			0
related ] but , crucially , the @entity49 said there was insufficient evidence to show that @entity52 , 43 , lied about what had happened			0
nor is he facing a misconduct inquiry			0
mr @entity2 claimed the police had failed to even interview @entity52 as a suspect about what happened			1
and he accused metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity59 of prematurely clearing his officers of wrongdoing			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ pc @entity14 , who was responsible for writing those toxic phrases into his notebook , was not telling the truth			1
' i will seek to say this on oath in a court of law and it is our intention to ensure that pc @entity14 has similarly to swear his account			1
‘ i understand that pc @entity14 has not been arrested or even interviewed under criminal caution during the police inquiry			1
’ the former @entity13 chief whip named pc @entity14 - with whom he clashed in @entity17 - branding him a serial liar and demanding that he repeat his claims that he used the word ' plebs ' on oath in a statement , @entity52 said last night : ‘ i stand by my account of events in @entity17 on 19th september 2012			1
' this has now been thoroughly investigated and the @entity49 has confirmed there is insufficient evidence to take any criminal proceedings against me			0
‘ in addition , neither am i subject to any disciplinary proceedings			2
' i confirm that i am prepared to give evidence under oath if required			0
’ mr @entity2 is suing @entity94 newspaper , which printed the original report , for libel and said he believed the paper would have to call @entity28 to corroborate the paper ’s account , forcing him to give evidence on oath			1
@entity101 said @entity52 was interviewed under ‘ police misconduct regulations ’ – not under police caution			2
but it added his statement could have been used against him had he been charged with criminal or internal disciplinary offences			0
the announcement by new director of public prosecutions @entity108 fell far short of the result that mr @entity2 had sought if he is to resume his cabinet career			1
she said : ‘ we have considered all of the evidence in this case , including previously unseen , unedited @entity118 footage from @entity17 , not referred to by the media			0
' taking it all into account , including the accounts of the officer at the gate of @entity17 and that of @entity2 mp before , during and after the incident , we have found that there is insufficient evidence to show that the officer at the gate lied in his account			2
‘ the @entity49 has also found that there is insufficient evidence to show that mr @entity2 was the victim of a conspiracy of misinformation			1
’ her lawyers also found that a jury would be likely to decide that the leaking of an email in the affair was in the public interest , a finding that could undermine mr @entity2 ’s attempt to sue the @entity94 sir @entity59 said : ‘ this investigation has been a ruthless search for the truth as at the heart of this are extremely damaging allegations that officers have lied and falsified statements against a cabinet minister			1
’ a @entity156 documentary into the @entity6 affair has been called into question by the new head of the @entity49			2
last december ’s programme – hailed by @entity2 and his supporters – appeared to cast doubt on the officers ’ account of what happened			2
it revealed @entity118 footage which showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the main gate of @entity17 at the time of the altercation as had originally been claimed			0
mr @entity2 at the gate where he clashed with the officer			1
he flatly denies claims that he used the word after he was stopped cycling through the street 's gates last september but director of public prosecutions @entity108 , who succeeded @entity180 earlier this month , said the programme ‘ showed edited footage that was less than clear in a number of regards ’			1
she said in her 1,800 - word statement on @entity6 : ‘ much of the press reporting to date has assumed that the @entity118 recordings show that the gate officer lied about the words used during the incident			2
‘ the @entity118 footage that has been aired publicly was edited and did not show the full picture			0
‘ we have been supplied with previously unseen and unedited footage of the incident from five different cameras			0
the cctv footage does not determine the issue completely as it could be consistent with either the accounts of the officer on the gate or mr @entity2			1
‘ it is clear from the footage that there was sufficient time for the words to have been said either as described by the gate officer or as described by mr @entity2 , and this has been confirmed by an expert			1
’ a @entity156 spokesman defended its journalism on @entity6			0
he said : ‘ the @entity118 footage was obtained by @entity2 from @entity17 and provided to @entity211 and @entity212			2
the footage as broadcast for the first time on 18th december 2012 was not edited by the production team to change or alter the sequence of events			0
‘ furthermore the three camera angles that we were provided with were image - matched frame by frame to confirm their veracity			0
we stand fully behind this investigation			0
’ at his televised press conference yesterday , mr @entity2 made clear his appreciation of the @entity156 documentary , and selected @entity229 , @entity212 ’s political correspondent – with whom he enjoys a strong professional relationship – to ask him the first question from the floor			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
