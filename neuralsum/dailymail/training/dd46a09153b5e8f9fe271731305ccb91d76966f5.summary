i did not go to heaven			2
' ' i said i went to heaven because i thought it would get me attention			0

home life : @entity6 is able to stand with the help of a brace and has been taken on runs by his mother , right ' it is both puzzling and painful to watch the book @entity19 to not only continue to sell , but to continue , for the most part , to not be questioned			1

' and she adds that @entity6 previously told a pastor that the book was made up , but was told the publication was ' blessing ' people and to stay quiet			1
she concludes : ' the ones making money from the book are not the ones staying up through the night , struggling for their breath , or were they the ones at six years old , waking up unable to move or breathe and in a strange place after last remember seeing a car coming right at the car he was riding in '			2

@entity6 said he wrote the book because he thought it would get him ' attention ' ; it became a best seller ' i want the whole world to know that the @entity59 is sufficient			1
