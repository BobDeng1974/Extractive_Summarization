@entity1 manager @entity0 believes a trip to @entity3 to face a @entity5 side on a roll is perfect for his players despite their shaky confidence			1
failure to get out of the @entity11 group stages following a 1 - 1 draw against @entity13 in midweek was a considerable blow to a squad which had looked to have turned a corner , however small , in recent weeks			1
contrast that with @entity5 , who are far from at their fluent best but have won five games in a row to lift them into third place in the table			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 saw his team exit the @entity11 after a 1 - 1 draw to @entity26 @entity27 had given @entity1 hope with a late free kick but his side were unable to secure the win a dejected @entity32 ( centre ) walks off the pitch after @entity1 were only able to draw with @entity26 defeat for @entity1 this weekend would leave them 10 points adrift of their arch - rivals and put @entity11 qualification even further out of sight			1
but @entity0 insists facing up to their greatest rivals could be the ideal remedy			1
' the game against @entity5 is perfect for us and we hope to take confidence and spirit into the game , ' he said			1
' it 's more than a football game - you 're representing a city and a group of supporters where there has been a great rivalry over many years			2
' you 've just got to find the ways to refocus the minds of the players , forget and learn from the experiences , and look at it as an opportunity to go and get onto a winning run			2
' you have to be [ determined ] when you 're at a club this size			2
the expectancy is what you want			2
' we 're very much focused on improving that performance level			0
we know that we can do that - we can put a run of results together that can keep us climbing			0
' but really we want to keep improving on the performance level			0
as my teams have shown , we 'll get better as the season goes on but we want to start that sooner rather than later			0
' @entity27 ( centre ) scored two penalties the last time @entity1 played @entity5 at @entity3 @entity27 celebrates after scoring the second goal against @entity5 for @entity1 unsurprisingly criticism increased after their @entity11 failure but @entity0 said they would shrug that off and look to bounce back			1
' one thing that we 've always had here has been the spirit in the camp , ' he added			0
' no matter what the outside influences , what is spoken and written about , we 've always retained that strong mentality and the focus is very much back on getting ourselves sorted for the weekend			0
' it was vital we could not dwell on the disappointment for too long			0
' having guided the side to within reach of winning the title last season the tables have turned for @entity0 and the @entity99 is now third - favourite to be the next boss to lose his job , behind bottom side @entity109 's @entity105 and @entity106 , whose @entity108 team have won just one in nine league matches			1
@entity0 built up a considerable amount of credit with owners @entity112 after last season , which culminated in him being given a new contract , and he is not worried about the @entity116 wielding the axe just yet			2
@entity5 manager @entity118 has led his team to third position in the table with five consecutive victories ' one thing i have always had with the owners and the players is solidarity , ' he said			1
' of course the owners have seen the progress over the last couple of years and like us all are disappointed with performances this season			0
' but it is about reinforcing what we have done well in the last couple of years but planning to keep the club moving forward			0
' that is the key objective for them and a primary objective for myself			0

@entity1 *crashed* out of the @entity11 on *tuesday* to @entity26
@entity0 ' team has *slumped* to ninth in the @entity144
but he believes @entity5 clash is the ' perfect ' game to hit form
