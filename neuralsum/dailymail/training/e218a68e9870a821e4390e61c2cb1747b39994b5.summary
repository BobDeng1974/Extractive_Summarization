by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 10 november 2012 updated : 03:02 est , 12 november 2012 near miss : sir @entity2 and wife @entity3 at the launch of @entity6 's cookbook just hours before the incident sir @entity8 and his wife were just two feet away from disaster when the pilot of their helicopter became ‘ disorientated ’ in bad weather and plunged towards trees			1
they avoided a potentially fatal crash with just a split second to spare when the pilot dramatically lifted the chartered @entity20 away from the rain - lashed tree tops			2
the drama happened as the aircraft , with the couple on board , attempted to land at night on a helipad at their @entity28 estate			0
the helicopter eventually touched down safely after diverting to a nearby airport			1
it is understood that sir @entity2 , 70 , and his 52 - year - old wife , @entity3 – who have declined to comment about the incident – were unaware how close they came to crashing			1
the near miss is being investigated by the @entity37			0
the @entity38 can reveal that the @entity39 has categorised the episode as a ‘ serious incident ’ , which it defines as ‘ involving circumstances indicating that an accident nearly occurred ’			2
according to the @entity39 report , the minimum reading from the helicopter ’s altimeter – which measures height by focusing on a fixed point – was ‘ two feet ’			0
it is understood the fixed point was the tree tops rather than the ground			0
in pulling hard away , the 55 - year - old pilot was forced to put immense pressure on the engine , which can itself be dangerous			2
the report also reveals flying conditions that night included ‘ low cloudbase , poor visibility and rain ’			1
despite this , the pilot pressed ahead and prepared to land on the former @entity67 ’s helipad , which is in the corner of a field encircled by woodland			0
it adds : ‘ while manoeuvring , the commander became disorientated and the helicopter descended towards tops of trees in the forested area to the south and west of the landing site			2
’ the pilot then ‘ executed a go - around ’ or aborted landing			1
the £ 5 million nine - seater helicopter , which weighs 5.3 tons , was chartered from @entity85 , which describes itself as the ‘ leading @entity87 - based business aviation service provider ’			1
the firm counts @entity89 among its clients and charges around £ 3,000 an hour			0
earlier in the evening , the couple had been to the @entity94 department store in the @entity95 for the launch of a vegetarian cookbook written by sir @entity2 ’s eldest daughter @entity98			1
they took off from @entity100 in @entity87 at 9.30pm , reaching @entity28 25 minutes later			0
luxury travel : sir @entity2 and his wife were flying in a nine - seater @entity85 helicopter worth £ 5million following the aborted landing , the pilot eventually landed safely after diverting to @entity106 in @entity107 , 15 miles from their home near @entity109			1
the report also reveals that weeks after the may 3 incident , the flight data was examined using incorrect software			0
this meant @entity85 was unaware the helicopter had exceeded its limitations and a ‘ maintenance ’ inspection was required			1
it prompted the @entity39 – which makes no judgment on blame in accidents and serious incidents – to issue a safety recommendation about the software			0
the report does not mention the helicopter ’s speed at the time of the incident , although some experts suggested it may have been about 60mph			2
the @entity20 ’s maximum cruising speed is 178mph			0
close call : the helipad on sir @entity2 's @entity28 estate in the corner of a field surrounded by dense trees @entity138 , chief executive of the @entity139 , last night described the incident as ‘ alarming ’			1
he said : ‘ he [ the pilot ] was going to land and realised he was n’t in control of the aircraft because of the weather conditions and visibility ; he pulled in lots of power to climb away and correct the aircraft to its proper flightpath and missed whatever it was by two feet			1
’ the @entity85 pilot thought to have been at the controls during the incident lives in @entity156 with his family			1
he told a reporter yesterday : ‘ i ca n’t say anything			0
’ his company declined to say whether he faced disciplinary action			0
as well as executive travel , the @entity20 twin - engine helicopter is used for search and rescue missions			2
on its website , @entity165 , @entity85 ’s operations manager , says : ‘ the beauty of helicopter travel is that you really can be picked up from a suitable local site , possibly your own garden , if it is big enough			1
this negates the need for airports and all the associated hassle they entail			0
’ elsewhere , the website says : ‘ throughout the past ten years , the @entity85 fleet has been constantly updated to ensure that our customers have the very best and latest machines available ; today we have the finest examples of vip helicopters			2
‘ @entity85 ’s future looks set to continue the long established statement of quality , safety , comfort and style			2
’ a spokesman for @entity85 said : ‘ @entity190 can confirm that an incident took place on may 3 involving an @entity85 helicopter			1
‘ we are working in full cooperation with the @entity39 which are currently investigating the incident			0
’ last night sir @entity2 ’s spokesman said : ‘ @entity2 has been spoken to			1
it has been put to him , everything			0
it ’s a no comment			0

sir @entity2 and his wife were flying in a £ 5million 9 - seater @entity85 helicopter
pilot was not in control because of poor weather conditions
following aborted landing at sir @entity2 's estate , pilot landed at nearby airport
air accident investigators have launched ' serious incident ' probe
