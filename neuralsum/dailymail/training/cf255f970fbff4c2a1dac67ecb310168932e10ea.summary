@entity6 then turned on the woman 's lawyers , @entity58 and @entity59 , accusing them of failing to properly investigate her claims			1
' if they had checked my travel records , if they had asked me and i could have given them the names of people who were witnesses - they would know the story is totally untrue , ' he said			0

' he added that attorney @entity111 , who is handling related litigation , has invited @entity6 to provide sworn testimony and any evidence - including his passport travel pages and photographs of him at @entity16 's properties - relating to his part in the suit by january 19			1
@entity58 added : ' we intend only to litigate the relevant issues in court and not to play into any sideshow			0

' you can not allow these allegations to hang above you , ' @entity6 said in the interview			2
' the first question you have to ask yourself when you are charged with a crime like this is , " is there any conceivable possibility you did it ? " and if the answer to that is ' no ' , you have to fight back with every resource and ounce of energy available to you			0
' the prince , who has cut short a vacation to travel back to the @entity189 , has issued a strongly - worded denial , with @entity191 saying ' any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue '			0

her father , @entity231 , has also spoken out to say that prince @entity2 should be prosecuted if the claims were true			1
the suit , which is civil not criminal , has been filed against the government and not prince @entity2 so he does not face any penalties			1
over the weekend , police sources in the @entity189 said that the @entity2 could face an investigation if @entity18 makes a formal complaint against him			2
mr @entity231 , 58 , also claimed his daughter had been introduced to the @entity240 while visiting @entity241 with @entity16 - but @entity191 has denied the allegations			2
