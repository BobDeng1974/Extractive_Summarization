by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam saturday 2 august : @entity4 v @entity2 - 2pm saturday 2 august : @entity6 v @entity5 - 4.20pm sunday 3 august : @entity5 v @entity4 - 2pm sunday 3 august : @entity6 v @entity2 - 4.20pm the @entity11 gets underway this weekend with @entity6 fans excited at the opportunity to see summer signing @entity14 in action for the first time			1
the @entity18 international is n't the only star attraction at the four - team tournament though that also features @entity2 , @entity5 and @entity4			1
@entity23 previews the star men to watch for each team over the weekend			0
@entity6 @entity26 man : @entity14 @entity27 finds himself in an unusual position of having concluded his major business early in the summer , with this tournament offering an early glimpse of what kind of potential he has amassed			1
the hope is that @entity14 will feature , with the broader wish among @entity6 ’s support that he is , in fact , the missing piece of the puzzle			1
@entity27 was positively beaming this week when he spoke about the qualities brought to the party by the £ 30million forward , usurped at @entity42 by @entity43 but welcomed like a kind of messiah at the @entity46			0
‘ so i took him because he is a player who has the qualities of @entity55 , he goes behind the defenders off the ball			0
‘ and with the quality of his runs he can be very important for us			0
i think he will give us an extra dimension , in terms of quality and threat			0
and i hope i ’m right			0
’ @entity69 , who cost £ 12million from @entity70 , is likely to battle with new arrival @entity71 , a £ 10m signing from @entity73 , for the right - back slot , but @entity75 , so impressive at the @entity76 with @entity77 , has a thigh injury			0
up for the challenge : @entity69 is set to rival @entity71 for the right - back berth at @entity6 @entity2 @entity26 man : @entity47 with @entity82 sold to @entity83 for north of £ 70m , @entity2 lose a little bit of their allure			1
but in @entity88 they have an excellent midfielder worth watching and , besides , they also have @entity47			2
the £ 53m @entity91 is a magnificent talent and one who was so cruelly denied a place in the @entity76 but a serious knee injury suffered in january			0
predator : @entity47 is one of the world 's deadliest strikers and is a target for @entity83 the 28 - year - old now appears likely to appear for @entity2 against @entity4 , for his first appearance in six months			1
@entity83 will likely be watching as they plan a move to sign @entity47			2
@entity2 coach @entity104 told @entity105 : ‘ i think he will be able to start playing again at the @entity11			1
he is now in the final phase of his recuperation			0
’ another familiar face will be @entity110			0
pastures new : @entity2 will be without @entity82 who completed a move to @entity83 in july @entity4 @entity26 man : @entity114 this is far from a vintage @entity4 side , arriving in @entity117 on the back of a woeful season in which they finished eighth in @entity122 and were trounced 3 - 0 at home by @entity124 in the @entity125			1
financially they found themselves in a bit of a mess			0
to @entity117 and @entity4 travel with a new manager , @entity130 , a former goalkeeper at @entity131 under @entity132 , and only modest hopes			2
out to impress : @entity4 's @entity114 ( left ) will face parent club @entity5 on sunday having moved on loan they have a genuine talent in the form of @entity114 , who had an unremarkable loan spell at @entity140 in 2010 - 11 but is a fine striker			1
a product of @entity83 ’s academy , the former @entity143 under 21 player is on loan in @entity143 from @entity5			2
@entity4 ’s most recent pre-season results have a defeat on penalties to @entity152 side @entity150 and a 3 - 1 loss to @entity154 of the @entity156 second division			1
@entity26 pedigree : @entity114 ( right ) is a product of @entity83 's academy and is a former @entity143 under 21 international @entity5 @entity26 man : @entity160 the form team of the competition come in on the back of an excellent season			1
they won a domestic treble and reached the final of the @entity125 , where they lost on penalties against @entity170			0
@entity171 has built a solid side , with possibly the strongest point being @entity160 on the left wing			2
against @entity6 , he will likely come up against @entity69 or @entity71 , both new signings at right back , and it will be a match - up worth watching			1
@entity177 : @entity160 played a key role on the left wing as @entity5 won a domestic treble last season @entity160 did n’t make @entity183 ’s @entity76 squad , but the 26 - year - old was arguably @entity5 ’s finest player last season , lighting up the @entity186 final and also drawing significant attention from @entity188			1
@entity190 @entity189 has also proven himself as a prolific forward , while @entity192 , at 31 , is still extremely effective despite a relatively tame 2013 - 14 season			0
@entity5 drew huge strength from their defence last season with @entity196 , their 33 - year - old , producing one of his finest campaigns			2
rock solid : captain @entity196 enjoyed a stellar season at @entity5 leading the @entity202 champions last term			0

the @entity11 gets underway on saturday in what could see @entity14 make his @entity6 debut
the two - day four - team tournament also features @entity2 , @entity4 and @entity5
@entity2 's @entity47 , @entity4 's @entity114 and @entity5 's @entity160 are all *expected* to shine for their *respective* sides
