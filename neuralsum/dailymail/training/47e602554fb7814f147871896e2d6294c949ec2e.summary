the illegitimate son a wealthy @entity1 aristocrat has been awarded a € 2million inheritance in a five - year legal battle reminiscent of a @entity6 plot			1
@entity7 , 59 , was born to 17 - year - old servant girl @entity8 in 1955 , after she had an affair with the late @entity11 - based landowner @entity10			1
as the boy was illegitimate @entity12 refused to recognise him as his son , which led to his adoption and eventually to him receiving no money when his father died aged 82 in 2001			2
but following a lengthy legal fight that saw his family secretly exhume @entity12 's body and have it cremated in order to destroy the dna , a judge has now ruled that @entity8 , who works as a waiter in @entity27 , has the same right to the family fortune as his three legitimate brothers			1
illegitimate : @entity7 , 59 , was born to 17 - year - old servant girl @entity8 in 1955 , after she had an affair with the late @entity11 - based landowner @entity10 @entity8 was born on his father 's estate near @entity11 at a time when the law allowed wealthy aristocrats to easily disown children they had fathered outside of marriage			1
the problem was particularly prevalent in southern @entity1 in the mid- 1950s			0
as she was not receiving any additional income to look after her son , his mother was forced to give @entity8 up for adoption , although the pair kept in regular contact , according to @entity47			0
when @entity10 died in 2001 his estate was divided between his legitimate offspring			1
eight years later @entity8 started legal action to claim his share of the money , claiming his mother deserved justice after being forced to give up the child she loved			2
in a bizarre twist early in the case , @entity10 's family dug up the aristocrat 's body and had it cremated before dna tests ordered by the court could be conducted			1
the tests were ordered in the hope of proving @entity10 was @entity8 's father - something his family had long denied			1
but the judge this week finally ruled in favour of @entity8 and awarded him $ 2million - claiming the ' extraordinary obstruction ' of his three brothers and the family likeness was enough to prove @entity10 had been his biological father			2
@entity8 is not the only illegitimate @entity1 waiter to launch a high - profile court case arguing his right to an aristocratic inheritance			0
@entity77 ( left ) claims he is the son of @entity1 's former @entity78 ( right ) the case came to court after @entity1 changed its inheritance laws in 2006 , allowing women and children born outside marriages the same right to inherit family fortunes as their legitimate siblings			0
since then dozens of high profile cases have emerged where the first - born daughters of aristocrats and politicians have been granted wealth and titles they would n't have received under the old law			0
bizarrely @entity8 is not the only illegitimate @entity1 waiter to launch a high - profile court case arguing his right to a large inheritance from his aristocratic father			0
@entity77 , 58 , whose adoptive parents are peasants from @entity99 , claims he is the illegitimate son of @entity1 's former @entity78 - the monarch who abdicated the throne in july and allegedly bedded more than 1,500 women			0
in august - after the former king lost his immunity by quitting quit the throne - @entity77 lodged his claim in the country 's highest court in a bid to finally prove he is of royal blood .			0

@entity7 was born to a 17 - year - old servant girl in 1955
she had been having an affair with wealthy landowner @entity10
but the aristocrat refused to recognise the child and forced his adoption
when @entity10 died in 2001 his estate was divided between legitimate sons
@entity125 then exhumed the late aristocrat 's body and cremated the remains in order to destroy dna evidence proving he had fathered @entity8
but judge said family *resemblance* is enough and awarded @entity8 money
