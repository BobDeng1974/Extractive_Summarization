@entity0 sent revenge porn to his jilted lover 's daughter and threatened to post a sex video on the mother 's @entity6 page a mother whose jilted lover sent revenge porn to her 18 - year - old daughter has spoken of the ' absolute nightmare ' her life became as he bombarded her with abusive messages			1
@entity0 , 42 , plagued his victim with messages over the internet , even threatening to post a sex video of her on her @entity6 page			1
the terrified woman said her life became a living ' hell ' when @entity0 , who was jailed last week , sent an explicit photo of her to her own daughter			1
' it got so bad i considered suicide , ' the mother said			1
' if it had n't have been for some great friends i would have gone through with it			2
' ' it was n't nice for my daughter			1
it was my past - years ago			2
my kids did n't need to know about that			2
' i was trying to move on with my life			1
it 's part of my life i want to totally erase			1
' i know i 'm not blameless because i should n't have slept with him			2
it was a stupid , stupid thing to do , it was a drunken thing			2
but it made my life an absolute nightmare			1
' @entity0 knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes , @entity42 heard			1
he and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through @entity6 in 2013			1
they met up for three dates between january and september 2013 but had sex on just one occasion			2
the court was told that the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again			1
soon afterwards she began receiving ' creepy ' messages from the defendant , saying he loved her and wanted to be with her			2
as a result , she ' unfriended ' him on @entity6 and changed her mobile phone number			0
during the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different @entity6 accounts in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site			1
the victim said : ' my life was made hell			1
i became depressed , anxious and scared to leave the house			0
@entity0 was jailed for 12 weeks and ordered to not contact woman again following a trial at @entity42 ( pictured ) ' he did n't know where i lived but i thought " what if he finds out ? " it got me worried to go out , i was constantly looking over my shoulder			1
i became very depressed , and the fact that he was sending pictures to my daughter was the final straw			2
' it was just constant			0
there was no let - up			0
some people said " oh it 's only messages " , but it consumes your life			1
' they say you should delete your @entity6 account but it 's a way of keeping in touch with my friends and family , especially friends i do n't get to see			0
i blocked him but each time he set up new profiles to get past it ... there was no way he was going to stop			0
' she reported @entity0 to @entity6 but the social media site did not take any action , the victim claims			1
@entity0 , 42 , plagued his victim with messages over the internet , including threatening to post a sex video of her on her @entity6 page eventually the woman told the police about the messages , ending the abuse , but the court case was yet another ordeal			1
she gave evidence from behind a screen that was just a few yards away from @entity0 , who smirked as she spoke			1
' i thought if i did n't go to court he could carry on doing it , so i got the courage from somewhere , ' she said			0
' i 'm happy i did , but it was difficult			0
this has been going on since august 2013 so it 's nice to be believed			0
' it feels like a weight 's been lifted and hopefully this will be the end of it			0
' ' i 'm happy the police arrested him and brought him to justice			0
i hope this sends the message out that you ca n't do this kind of thing			0
' i have no idea how i got through it			0
there was a point where i was going to give in until a very , very good friend of mine said " you can not let this man do this to you anymore "			0
she was very concerned about my health , my mental stability			0
' the government has made this sort of thing a criminal offence , and that is a good thing			0
' but i think about young children and teenagers who are going through a similar nightmare , and it sickens me			0
there are people out there who are not strong enough to deal with it			0
' @entity0 , from @entity169 , @entity170 , was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial			1
as well as being jailed , he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim			1
district judge @entity174 said : ' you harassed the complainant over a three - month period and used social networks constantly in a threatening manner to get her to re-engage with you			2
' there are a number of aggravating features in this case			0
' you sought to use dozens of @entity6 profiles to get in touch with her , you also found a link to a pornographic site and made use of that			0
' you either involved or threatened to involve others , sending the link to the woman 's friends and her sister , insinuating that her children might get to see the photos			2
' you used the power you had over her by the knowledge of those photos			0
