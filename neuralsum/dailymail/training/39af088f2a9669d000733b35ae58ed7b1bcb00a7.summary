i say to myself well done @entity73			0
i think i ’m allowed to do that when i win a set			0
what , i have to be worried about every word i am going to say ? i just pumped myself up for winning the first set then sat on the chair			0
maybe next time i should stay even more calm , and that ’s it			0
it was a great battle a good match , unfortunately with a bad end for me			0
' @entity88 , @entity3 's former coach , watches on as his new charge @entity4 battles on @entity4 complained to umpire @entity128 about the quality of the balls during the game as @entity3 let out some expletives in annoyance at his own play , the big screens in @entity157 further added to the drama			1

it is a big match and a lot was made of @entity72 working with him			0
