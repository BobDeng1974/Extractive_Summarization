by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham @entity1 swept aside @entity3 holders @entity2 in the @entity4 to send a warning to their title rivals that they mean business this season			1
the @entity10 were top for almost the entire first half of the last campaign but eventually finished well off the pace			2
here , @entity14 brings you five reason why they can go all the way this year			0
@entity18 @entity1 's new £ 30million man @entity19 is the latest gem , full of class and elegance and technique to match , at @entity25 's disposal			1
he may have played only 45 minutes against @entity2 , but the plucky @entity26 showed glimpses of what @entity1 fans can expect from him this season			1
@entity19 can play anywhere across the front line and will cause havoc for defences across the country with his adeptness at switching flanks or playing through the middle			2
like the club , he started the campaign strongly but faded towards the end			0
fresh from winning the @entity56 with @entity57 , if @entity49 can carry that confidence into his second season in north @entity60 then he could well become one of the stars of the league			1
no - one doubts that the forward has the ability to become @entity1 's attacking fulcrum and it will make them one of the most dangerous teams in the league if he fulfils that potential			1
fresh start : @entity49 should be full of confidence after helping @entity57 win the @entity56 in @entity74 video @entity76 trio to miss start of season - @entity25 attacking options @entity25 was going weak at the knees about his attacking options after they hit three past @entity2 on sunday			1
not only have they spent more than £ 70m on @entity19 and @entity49 in the past year , they have welcomed back @entity84 from his loan spells and after his displays at the @entity56 for @entity87 and at @entity88 last season he is like another signing			1
they 've added to @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 to create a frightening choice of attacking options			2
option : the return of @entity104 ( right ) from a loan spell will improve the @entity10 ' attack after the @entity4 victory @entity25 said : ' three , four , five years ago we lost a big player every year			1
in the last two years we ’ve added players , like @entity49 and @entity19			1
i have more attacking options than i ’ve had for a long time			0
' big game mentality @entity1 ultimately came undone by their inability to perform well against the top sides last season			2
they were on the receiving end of some humiliating defeats – a 6 - 3 loss to @entity2 , a 6 - 0 hammering by @entity121 and a 5 - 1 demolition by @entity123			1
@entity95 admitted after the @entity4 : ' in these games last season we have been guilty of conceding early on			2
it 's difficult enough so it was important today for us to stay in the game , wait for them to open up , and we capitalised on that			0
room for improvement : @entity95 believes @entity1 are ready to perform against the league 's big teams ' we ’re more than capable - the team has a good team spirit			1
we need to improve on the big games so hopefully now we ’ve learnt our lesson , we can go into this season and have a good go			0
' his manager agreed with him			0
' last year we were very consistent against teams outside the top six and not consistent against top - six teams , ' @entity25 said			2
' the year before it was the reverse			0
it ’s hoped that this year it will be right on both sides			0
' get that right and they will be one of the favourites to lift the title			0
@entity154 @entity25 threw young defender @entity155 in at the deep end playing in the centre of defence – having played last season as right back for @entity160 – against one of the best attacks in the country			2
he was one of best players on the pitch			0
@entity43 ' reading of the game makes him a ideal at the heart of the defence and @entity25 has already told the player he will trial him at centre back or possibly as a defensive midfielder			0
he is still only 19 but , following his £ 12m move , has already been talked about as having the potential to emulate @entity174 at the north @entity60 club			0
bright future : summer signing @entity155 can play at both right - back and centre - back @entity25 described his display against @entity2 as ' outstanding ' and hinted that @entity43 could be first - choice centre back this season			1
if the @entity184 has unearthed another @entity174 , they will have one of the most formidable defences in the league to match their attack .			0

@entity1 comfortably beat title holders @entity2 3 - 0 in the @entity4 at @entity191 on sunday
summer signing @entity19 looks set to shine for the @entity10
@entity49 will return from his @entity56 victory with a point to prove
@entity95 believes his side are ready to perform against the @entity3 's best teams
*youngster* @entity155 has the potential to star in defence
