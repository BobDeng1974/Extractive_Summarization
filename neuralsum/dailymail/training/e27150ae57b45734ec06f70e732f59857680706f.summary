@entity30 and @entity31 from the @entity37 near @entity38 , @entity36 say more then 600 billion single - use bottles were sold globally last year			1
in @entity41 alone , studies show that around 1,500 single - use water bottles are consumed every second - and only 20 per cent of these are recycled			2

earlier this year a trio of designers created an alternative to the plastic water bottle - a container made from an edible algae balloon			1
called @entity66 , the spheres can be produced in different sizes , hygienically protect the liquid inside , and cost just 2 cents ( less than a penny ) each			1
the design was crowned one of 12 winners of the second annual @entity74 and is due to go on sale in @entity76 later this year			1
' the @entity4 was designed to overcome two problems that we see in our society			2
' firstly our attachment to the outdoors and environment - we have always been disgusted with the overuse of singly use plastic bottles			0
' we developed a passionate desire to reduce their usage and their disastrous effect on the environment			0
' secondly , throughout our schooling and university years , and to a larger extent our professional work life , we have been frustrated with the inability to fit water bottles in carry / laptop bags			0
' somewhere along the line , there has been a general consensus to design circular shaped bottles			0
' rather than making a product that fits into this category , we decided to create something that is easy to transport but still holds the functional aspects of traditional bottles			2
' the bottle will be available in three different sizes - @entity109 which holds 750ml ( 1.3 pints ) , @entity110 which holds 1.25 litres ( 2.2 pints ) and letter size which also stores 1.25 litres the product is seeking funding on @entity114 and has already soared past its primary goal of raising £ 8,310 ( $ 13,500 ) , reaching it in just 36 hours designer @entity31 said : ' the feedback we ’ve received have been overwhelmingly positive !
