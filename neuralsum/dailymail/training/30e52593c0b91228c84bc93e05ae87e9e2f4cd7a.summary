the free service uses text messages so it can be used by people without a smartphone and in areas without an internet connection			1
it was invented by @entity33 , in @entity34 to keep his girlfriend safe			1
the 23 - year old @entity37 computer science graduate told @entity38 : ' my girlfriend , who lives in a dangerous neighbourhood in @entity34 , called to ask me to check up on her as she was walking home from work one day			1
' i wondered if there might be an app or service that could offer a little extra safety for her when she goes out at night			0
' anyone wanting to use the service can set up an account on @entity53 ’s website , where they enter their phone number plus an emergency contact , as well as writing an alert message which will be sent to their chosen contact when needed			1

the free ' safecall ' service uses text messages so it can be used by people without a smartphone and in areas without an internet connection			1
to begin using the service , people have to create an account online and add contacts ( pictured ) which will be alerted by text in an emergency to use the service , people schedule a time and date for when they plan to be out and estimate how long they will be			2
this can be done online ( pictured ) and via text message @entity1 is a personal safety service , self - described as an ' overprotective mom '			2
how does it work ? users can ask @entity1 to check up on them at a specified time in the future and it will text them to make sure they ’re safe			2
a user must reply to the message - or check in on the website - and all is well			2
if they do n’t check in , @entity1 alerts their emergency contacts			2
it is possible to extend a trip or start a new trip if a user will be much later than they planned			0
extra security : people can set up a password to stop savvy attackers pretending to be them			0
a ‘ secret duress code ’ can also be used to send an alert message to emergency contacts in a moment of @entity102 : the basic version is free for 8 trips a month and there is no app to download			1

they can also customise their check - in period			0
compatibility : the service uses text messages so it works on any mobile phone in 217 countries			2
they can text kitestring a duration like ‘ 45m ’ to start a trip , for example , or click on options on the company 's website			0
when that time has passed , @entity1 sends a text message asking for confirmation that the person is safe			1
users can extend a trip by testing ‘ @entity131 ’ for example , to receive another text 15 minutes later , or can start another new trip if they expect to later than an hour after they originally said			0

but if someone ’s phone battery runs flat , contacts will still be notified , which could cause unnecessary panic			0
this is because the ‘ notifications system runs on our servers and does not depend on your phone being available , ’ the company says			0
because the service works using text messages , it makes itself useable by more people than previous ‘ safecall ’ apps for smartphones , which often rely on an internet connection and @entity162			1
@entity1 works in 217 countries , which could also make it handy for backpackers and other holidaymakers exploring a new area on their own			0
when that time has passed , @entity1 sends a text message asking for confirmation that the person is safe			1
this is one suggested by the service the service could be sued by backpackers in far flung places , or simply by people walking home in the dark ( illustrated ) , meeting someone for the first time or when travelling through dubious neighborhoods where they feel unsafe			0
unlike other services , @entity1 only needs basic mobile reception to send and receive a text			0
