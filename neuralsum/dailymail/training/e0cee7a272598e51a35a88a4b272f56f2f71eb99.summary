by @entity0 for @entity1 the cartoon @entity3 helped inspire @entity5 men to enlist in @entity6 , but the national figure is actually based on a real man who lived more than 200 years ago and briefly fought in the @entity9			1
@entity10 was born in @entity11 , @entity12 on september 13 , 1766 and went on to become a wealthy meat - packer and business owned in @entity15 , @entity16			1
it was his government contract supplying provisions to @entity5 troops during the @entity20 that @entity3 first inspired the larger - than - life caricature			1
inspiration : the character @entity3 is actually based on a real man who lived more than 200 years ago , and owned a slaughterhouse in @entity15 , @entity16 but @entity10 's service to the @entity5 started in 1781 , when he enlisted in the @entity28 at the age of 15			1
by the time he joined , the war was near a close and young @entity10 was deemed too weak to fight on the battlefield			0
so he spent his six months with the army guarding cattle , mending fences and helping to slaughter and package meat			0
he took that skill with him when he moved to @entity15 , @entity16 with his brother several years later			2
the @entity40 were one of the first pioneer families in the community and established several local businesses there , including a brick - making company			0
eventually @entity10 bought a parcel of land to start a meat - packing business , and when the @entity20 broke out , he secured an important contract to feed the soldiers in @entity16 and @entity51 for a year			1
legend : a statue memorializes the real @entity3 near his birthplace of @entity11 , @entity12 the 6,000 barrels of pork and beef that @entity57 slaughterhouse shipped to the soldiers in @entity61 , @entity16 were stamped with the label ' @entity63 - @entity5 '			1
most of the soldiers stationed in the area were from @entity15 and familiar with @entity10 , who was given the nickname @entity3 in the community			1
so the soldiers associated the @entity5 stamp with meaning both @entity3 and @entity5			1
soon all provisions , whether they came from @entity57 or not , were referred to as @entity3 's			2
after the war , an author writing under a pseudonym published ' the adventures of @entity3 : in @entity77 ' - one of the first references to @entity3 as the national personification			2
in the book , @entity3 was referred to as a meat packer , which lines up with the real @entity10 's background			2
but it was n't until 1860 that @entity3 started to resemble the character we know today			0
it was artist @entity88 who illustrated @entity3 as a tall , goateed , thin man wearing a pin - striped suit and star - spangled top hat			0
in real life , @entity10 was actually clean shaven			0
@entity96 used @entity88 's character as the basis for the most famous iteration of @entity3			0
in 1917 , @entity96 created the famous ' @entity3 ' propaganda poster which went on to sell more than 4million copies after appearing on the cover of @entity103 .			0

@entity10 was born in @entity12 in september 1766
he briefly fought in the @entity9 before starting a slaughterhouse in @entity15 , @entity16
during the @entity20 , his slaughterhouse @entity57 supplied provisions to soldiers in @entity16 and @entity51
the barrels of food were labelled ' @entity63 - @entity5 '
many of the soldiers receiving the food were from @entity15 and associated the @entity5 with meaning ' @entity3 '
