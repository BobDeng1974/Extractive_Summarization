by @entity0 , political editor changes to the law will see automatic jail terms for anyone caught carrying a knife for a second time criminals caught carrying a knife for the second time will face automatic jail sentences under plans to be backed by conservative mps in defiance of their @entity14 colleagues			1
in a significant fracturing of the coalition , @entity16 will next week urge @entity15 to vote for a toughening of punishments for repeat offences despite @entity23 's refusal to support the move			1
because of the @entity27 split , ministers will abstain , but backbenchers and parliamentary private secretaries , who are junior members of the government , are being encouraged to back the change			2
the decision means the reform will be implemented if , as is expected , it is backed by @entity34			0
it will the first time since the coalition was formed in 2010 that the @entity15 have forced through a change in the law while the @entity14 vote against it			1
a government source said : ' the conservatives have always made clear we want to do more to tackle knife crime			0
the commons will vote next week on an amendment to jail people caught carrying a knife on more than one occasion			2
' conservative ministers support these plans in principle			0
but because this is not an agreed coalition policy , they will abstain in tuesday 's vote			0
however , other conservative mps will be free to vote as they wish and these new powers stand a good chance of becoming law			1
' mr @entity23 was said to be ' bouncing off the walls ' last month after secret @entity62 correspondence was leaked to the @entity63 revealing senior @entity14 were resisting @entity15 proposals to introduce punishments for repeat knife offences			1
the @entity63 published a leaked letter to mr @entity23 from @entity14 treasury chief secretary @entity68 rejecting plans to impose a mandatory six - month jail sentence on any adult convicted of a second knife offence as too expensive			1
@entity16 ( left ) will next week urge @entity15 to vote for a toughening of punishments for repeat offences of knife crime despite @entity23 's refusal to support the move in another letter to the deputy prime minister , @entity14 schools minister @entity79 said mandatory minimum sentences were ' too blunt an instrument ' and said he was unwilling to support them			1
the deputy prime minister blamed the @entity15 for the highly unusual breach of @entity62 confidentiality , and @entity14 sources said the @entity15 should ' examine their consciences ' for engaging in political games in the aftermath of teacher @entity93 's killing			1
@entity15 sources said the proposal to tighten the law had , in fact , been under discussion for months in advance			1
labour mps are also expected to vote for the changes after @entity102 said he supports tougher sentences conservative cabinet ministers including @entity105 , the justice secretary , @entity107 , the home secretary , and @entity109 , the @entity110 and @entity111 , the defence secretary , have all lined up behind the plan for tougher knife laws			2
@entity115 , the veteran cabinet minister , is understood to be the only senior @entity15 backing the @entity14 , arguing judges ' hands should not be tied			1
@entity118 , the @entity118 mp for @entity119 , has tabled an amendment to a crime @entity122 introduce automatic jail terms , which his colleagues are being urged to support			1
backing from @entity125 will guarantee it is passed by the @entity127 next week			0
mr @entity118 said only one in four of the 16,031 cases of knife possession last year resulted in immediate custody			0
' i hope backbenchers from across the @entity134 will support this amendment and it can become law , ' he said			0
a senior @entity14 source said : ' the @entity14 have been clear from the outset that we do not agree with these proposals			2
' as a result , all @entity142 , whether ministers or backbenchers will be voting against the amendment â€“ the parliamentary party is united on this			0
' we believe in giving judges the flexibility to use their expertise and judgement , based on the facts of each case			0
@entity154 is often going to be the right option and violent offenders who are a danger to the public ought to be behind bars but that should be for judges to decide			0
' labour leader @entity102 said last month : ' i do n't agree with @entity23			0
i think we do need tougher penalties for knife crime			0
@entity125 has been consistently arguing that this is an issue that needs to be looked at and we definitely do want to use the legislation to strengthen the law , and we 're definitely sympathetic to the issue of mandatory sentences after a second offence			2

new rules will see automatic jail sentences for repeat offenders
changes come despite @entity14 *opposition* to the move
@entity16 will call on his mps to vote the changes through
could be first time @entity15 have forced law change without @entity14 help
