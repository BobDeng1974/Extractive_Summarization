the number of mentally - ill patients killed by euthanasia in @entity4 has trebled in the space of a year , new figures have revealed			1
in 2013 , a total of 42 people with ‘ severe psychiatric problems ’ were killed by lethal injection compared to 14 in 2012 and 13 in 2011			1
the latest official figures also revealed a 15 per cent surge in the number of euthanasia deaths from 4,188 cases in 2012 to 4,829 cases last year			1
the rise is also likely to confirm the fears of @entity4 regulator @entity27 who told the @entity30 that he expected to see euthanasia cases smash the 6,000 barrier in 2014			2
overall , deaths by euthanasia , which officially account for three per cent of all deaths in the @entity4 , have increased by 151 per cent in just seven years			1
most cases - some 3,600 people – involved cancer sufferers but there were also 97 people who died at the hands of their doctors because they were suffering from dementia , the figures show			1
the figures , however , do not include cases of so - called terminal sedation , where patients are given a cocktail of sedatives and narcotics before food and fluids are withdrawn			0
studies suggest that if such deaths were added to the figure then euthanasia would account for one in eight – about 12.3 per cent – of all deaths in the @entity4			1
dr @entity57 of the @entity58 said the @entity4 experiment proved that doctor - assisted death was impossible to effectively regulate			1
@entity4 regulator @entity27 said that he expected to see euthanasia cases smash the 6,000 barrier in 2014 in @entity4 ‘ euthanasia in the @entity4 is way out of control , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity66 calculated in 2005 that with a @entity4 - type law in @entity69 we would be seeing over 13,000 cases of euthanasia per year , ’ he continued			1
‘ on the basis of how @entity4 euthanasia deaths have risen since this may prove to be a gross underestimate			1
‘ what we are seeing in the @entity4 is “ incremental extension ” , the steady intentional escalation of numbers with a gradual widening of the categories of patients to be included			0
’ he said there was a similar pattern of increasing numbers of assisted suicide and euthanasia in the @entity90 state of @entity91 , @entity92 , and @entity93			0
dr @entity57 said : ‘ the lessons are clear			0
once you relax the law on euthanasia or assisted suicide steady extension will follow as night follows day			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity69 needs to take warning as debate on the @entity104 bill continues			0
’ @entity104 ’s @entity105 received its @entity106 in july and it will reach committee stage in november after @entity109 reconvenes			2
supporters , such as campaigners @entity111 , insist that the @entity113 is based on a @entity90 model of assisted suicide ‘ which has been working safely for over 17 years and has never been extended beyond the criteria of terminal illness ’			0
but professor @entity27 , who has reviewed 4,000 cases of euthanasia in his role as a regulator , told @entity109 in the summer : ‘ do n’t go there			2
’ once a firm advocate of euthanasia , he said that he now the @entity4 were ‘ terribly wrong ’ to think they could control it			2
writing in the @entity30 , he said his country has witnessed an ‘ explosive increase ’ in the numbers of euthanasia deaths since 2007 and that he expected the number of such deaths this year to hit 6,000			2
he was also gravely concerned at the extension of killing to new classes of people , including the demented and the depressed			0
‘ some slopes truly are slippery , ’ he said			0
doctors in neighbouring @entity93 , which this year legalised euthanasia for children , are now killing an average of five people every day by euthanasia , according to latest figures , with a 27 per cent surge in the number of euthanasia deaths in the last year alone			1
in one of the most shocking cases , a @entity146 man last week described how he arranged the double euthanasia of his octogenarian parents who wanted to die because they were afraid of loneliness			0
it has also emerged that a @entity4 woman in her 80s was killed by her doctors just because she did not want to live in a care home			2
the case is the first to be referred to @entity4 prosecutors by regulators since euthanasia was legalised in @entity4 12 years ago			0
euthanasia is permitted in cases where there is unbearable suffering , increasingly interpreted to mean mental anguish .			0

42 people with mental illnesses killed by lethal injection in @entity4 last year
this is three times more than the number who were euthanised in 2012
overall figures for assisted deaths show a 15 per cent surge in a year
doctors warn that the @entity4 euthanasia experiment is ' out of control '
@entity69 @entity105 to be *discussed* again in @entity109 next month
