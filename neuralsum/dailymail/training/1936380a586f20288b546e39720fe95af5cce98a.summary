by @entity0 published : 18:16 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 04:16 est , 12 july 2013 it was all going jolly well for @entity3 ’s cricketers in their campaign to retain the @entity5			0
but that was until a virtually unknown @entity8 teenager named @entity9 – dubbed ‘ @entity10 ? ’ – strolled in to bat with his team nine wickets down			1
and after a stunning innings in which the rookie humbled @entity3 and smashed cricketing records in the process , it was more a case of ‘ @entity10 wow ! ’ remarkably , 19 - year - old @entity9 was playing league cricket for @entity21 just a few months ago , as a way of learning about @entity24 pitches and conditions			1
did n't see that one coming : @entity9 scored 98 runs as number 11 batsman - a record - breaking feat - yesterday 's test match ( left )			1
a month ago he was playing for @entity29 in @entity21 on @entity30 ( right ) the experience clearly served him well yesterday as he scored 98 runs , tantalisingly short of becoming the first number 11 batsman to score a test century but still the highest in that position			1
his partnership of 163 with @entity36 was the highest for a 10th wicket in @entity38			0
the predominantly @entity24 crowd at @entity40 in @entity41 gave the youngster a standing ovation as he left the pitch and even former @entity3 captain @entity45 confessed that he was ‘ disappointed ’ when @entity9 was out			2
and it left @entity3 , the clear favourites to keep hold of the @entity5 trophy , facing something of a challenge			0
support : @entity9 is congratulated by his parents @entity54 and @entity55 and brothers @entity57 ( left ) and @entity58 ( right ) after his incredible performance on day two of the @entity5 test match between @entity3 and @entity61 at @entity40 and by the time he was eventually caught out , @entity61 were 65 runs ahead of @entity3 - and @entity63 had etched his name into the record books			1
@entity61 ’s delighted prime minister @entity66 hailed his ‘ stunning ’ performance and jokingly declared an ‘ @entity71 ’ in honour of the nation ’s newest hero			0
@entity9 ’s @entity72 - born mother @entity55 and brothers were in the crowd at @entity40 , having flown from @entity61 to witness his debut			2
wait for it : @entity9 's mum , @entity55 , thought he had scored his century ( left ) ... before realising her celebration was premature ( right ) @entity55 leaped out of her seat in joy when she thought her son had smashed a four to reach his century - but he was caught out by an @entity24 fielder			1
his father @entity54 revealed that @entity9 had rushed up to his family and apologised for failing to make the magical 100 runs			2
‘ he came over to his brothers and said sorry			0
he still had a smile on his face			0
he often looks up to us when we ’re in the stands , ’ he said			0
@entity9 had caused eyebrows to be raised simply by being picked to play in the opening @entity95			1
he had only ever previously played ten games of first class cricket in @entity61 .			0

@entity9 , 19 , was an unknown when was picked for this week 's test
a few months ago he was playing league cricket for lowly @entity21 cc
now the teenager has taken a place in the record books with huge innings
