@entity0 believes it would have been a ' travesty ' had @entity2 lost against @entity3 at @entity4 , having dominated for large spells of sunday 's encounter			1
after missing several chances at @entity8 in their defeat to @entity10 last time out , @entity2 were again guilty of profligacy in front of goal against the @entity15 at @entity4 , with 27 shots yielding just two goals			1
however , after going down to ten men following substitute @entity21 's dismissal , there are certainly plenty of positives to take out of the 2 - 2 draw , and @entity0 thinks things are looking up for @entity27 ' men			1
' it would have been a travesty if @entity2 would have lost that game			1
' they have been battered at times this season			2
they ’ve conceded too many goals and not been at their best for a while			0
' if you are looking for positives , today is as good as it gets for @entity2			2
@entity48 had a busy afternoon at @entity4 , with @entity2 finding the target on ten occasions @entity52 's late header rescued @entity2 , but @entity0 was pleased with what he saw ' i know they only drew 2 - 2 , but the manner with which they passed the ball they can only get better with @entity57 to come back			1
' going forward has been a problem , as well as at the back this season , but some of the movement was a joy to watch at times			0
' how they got themselves into a position to lose that match , with the amount of chances and possession that they had i do not know			2
' that have to sort it out defensively , yes , but if they keep passing like that things will improve			0
former @entity2 striker @entity75 backed @entity0 's claims that the @entity77 are certainly improving , and reserved special praise for two of the creators in @entity27 ' line - up			1
@entity75 was full of praise for @entity84 's movement and pace in attack against @entity3 @entity87 's performance was also praised as he begins to find his feet at @entity2 " i agree that @entity2 are much better , " @entity89 added			1
' i thought the performance against @entity10 was very good			2
then @entity92 and now today			0
' they are looking more of a threat that ’s for sure			0
' ( @entity84 ) @entity84 was brilliant today , and we are now seeing the best of ( @entity87 ) @entity87			0
' he has found a position and we are seeing what he did at @entity99			0
' all @entity84 needs is half a yard , he is that quick off the mark			0

@entity2 produced 27 shots at goal *compared* to just seven from @entity3
@entity3 had just *35* *%* possession - their lowest since @entity108 stats began
@entity0 liked what he saw from the @entity2 performance
*defending* still a cause for concern , but @entity0 praises attacking play
