a doctor with terminal cancer plans to tweet from her deathbed so people can understand what the experience is like			1
dr @entity6 , 31 , went through five rounds of chemotherapy after her diagnosis in july 2011 and was told she was unlikely to live longer than five years			1
but the sessions left her so ill she decided to stop receiving treatment and concentrate on enjoying a good quality of life with her family and friends			2
last week , the elderly care specialist asked her 3,200 @entity18 followers : ' any suggestions for an appropriate # for me to use when eventually i am actively popping my clogs & live tweeting the experience ? ' @entity6 and her husband @entity23 pictured on their wedding day in 2005			1
dr @entity6 plans to tweet until her last so that people can understand what the experience is like since her diagnosis , dr @entity29 , from @entity30 , found that dark humour helped her and husband @entity23 to cope with their situation			1
suggestions from her followers included : ' # deathbedlive , # finalcountdown , # exfactor , # onedieseveryminute , # goinggoinggone ' and ' @entity43 '			1
some asked her if she was serious about her tweeting plans , to which she said she was ' deadly ' so			1
' i thought it would be quite interesting for everyone to understand more about what the experience is like for me , ' she told the @entity51			1
' if my tweets about my death and what i ’m going through make one person talk to their loved one about what they would do that ’s a good thing			1
' positivity and humour help me get through the day and deal with what i ’m going through			2
' dr @entity29 hopes that tweeting from her deathbed will help people understand what the experience is like after her tweets , she published a blogpost entitled ' dying - can it ever be a laughing matter ? ' she wrote : ' do n’t get me wrong , i definitely was n’t making jokes on day one but soon after i started to use humour to help me get through the day			1
' some people around me were shocked by this attitude and language at first , but it ’s amazing how infectious it is and how it normalises this huge life event that is approaching for me			1
' dr @entity29 , who returned to work at @entity80 in @entity30 after treatment , has written a book about her illness , which was serialised in the @entity85 last year			1
she was diagnosed in august 2011 after she began suffering pains on the right side of her back while on holiday in the @entity91 @entity6 on holiday with husband @entity23			1
she hopes tweeting help other people talk to their loved ones about their dying wishes when she returned , her husband took her to @entity98 where tests revealed a huge mass in her abdomen and pelvis , some of which encased her ureters — the tubes connecting the kidneys and bladder			1
she was diagnosed with a desmoplastic small round cell tumour - an aggressive and rare tumor that primarily occurs as masses in the abdomen			2
in one extract from @entity114 , the proceeds of which go to the @entity116 , she said her illness had made her a better doctor			2
she wrote : ' it ’s made me realise how important the little things are — holding a patient ’s hand , sitting down with them and not standing over them , communicating news in a compassionate way and explaining the impact on them to their families			2
' dr @entity6 says that black humour helps her cope with her illness in january , she wrote again in the @entity85 how she had decided not to have any more treatment			1
she described the misery of spending @entity134 in hospital with an infection and decided the ' burdens ' of treatment outweighed the benefits			2
she wrote : ' although upset , i feel quite peaceful			0
i ’ve got much further with the treatment than i ever expected to			0
a few friends and family have said they think i ’m giving up too soon — but i ’m choosing to take control of how i live			0
i just want my old life back , even for a couple of months			0
' she also described how , ' as a control freak ' , she had planned every detail of her funeral such as the music , poems , prayers and dress code			0
' i ’ve written letters and cards to @entity23 up to his 70th birthday			0
i am now writing letters to other close family			0
' she also returned to work , saying : ' i am in pain but so pleased to be at work			0
if patients ask , i tell them i have cancer , otherwise i never mention it			2
' having cancer has changed me			2
it ’s made me realise how important the little things are — holding a patient ’s hand , sitting down with them and not standing over them , communicating news in a compassionate way and explaining the impact on them to their families			0
' i wrote this diary in the dark hours of my hospital stays			0
i want it to be in every medical school and hope my colleagues read it and think about how they practise medicine			0
' meanwhile , @entity23 and i are working through my bucket list — experiences i want to have while there ’s still time			0
we renewed our wedding vows in april , had tea at @entity192 , have been to @entity193 and we ’re going to @entity194			0
' i am blessed with my life — i have a job , husband and close family who i love very much , and i hope i ’ve made a difference			0
