the first game of 2015 and @entity1 will hope there are n’t too many more like it over the course of the next 12 months			0
if the @entity6 did n’t fully appreciate what to expect from a trip to a blustery @entity9 , he does now			2
@entity10 came through a gruelling early @entity12 test in which they were bombarded , buffeted , at times besieged and yet ultimately still unbeaten in 10 games stretching back to the start of november			2
former @entity18 favourite @entity17 has done a fine job polishing up the @entity20 since he took over here , but some of the old hallmarks still remain and @entity24 relished making life as uncomfortable as possible for @entity10 in the windy conditions			1
@entity27 ( second from left ) heads the ball and it falls to an unmarked @entity30 ( left ) who helps it on its way to the goal @entity30 reacted first as the ball fell kindly to him and he put it beyond @entity36 in the @entity10 goal @entity30 gave @entity24 the lead in the second minute against @entity10 at the @entity9 on @entity12 @entity30 celebrates while @entity39 ( left ) and co look gutted after allowing the @entity24 defender to be unmarked and score @entity10 's defence were poor as @entity24 took the lead after two minutes and could have beaten the visitors in the second half @entity47 runs in to meet the corner and sweep the ball into the back of the net to make it 1 - 1 at the @entity9 on thursday @entity47 equalises to make it 1 - 1 in the @entity55 match before half time at a windy @entity9 on @entity12 @entity47 celebrates scoring for @entity10 after @entity24 took an early lead against the @entity18 club @entity10 team - mates @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity47 celebrate making it 1 - 1 against @entity24 in the @entity55 match @entity1 looks on during the match as his @entity10 side were held to a 1 - 1 draw against @entity24 @entity24 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity64 6 , @entity65 5.5 , @entity30 7 , @entity66 6 , @entity67 6 , @entity68 6 , @entity69 6.5 , @entity70 7 ( @entity71 81 ) , @entity72 6 , @entity73 6.5 , @entity27 8 subs not used : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 goal : @entity30 ( 2 ) manager : @entity17 7 @entity10 ( 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity83 6 , @entity84 6 , @entity85 6.5 , @entity86 5 , @entity39 7 , @entity87 6 ( @entity88 75 ) , @entity60 6.5 , @entity59 5.5 , @entity89 7.5 ( @entity90 64 5.5 ) , @entity47 6.5 ( @entity91 , 64 5.5 ) , @entity92 5.5 subs not used : @entity77 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 goal : @entity47 ( 26 ) manager : @entity1 6.5 referee : @entity100 6.5 attendance : 27,203 man of the match : @entity27			1
ratings by @entity105 at the @entity9 this was how @entity30 gave @entity24 their second - minute lead ... click here to find more heat maps , statistics and goals ! in the absence of key playmaker @entity114 , @entity70 ’s set - pieces were a constant menace , @entity27 a constant threat			1
this was ‘ old school ’ @entity24 according to @entity27 who set up a goal for @entity30 inside two minutes , hit the post and had strong claims for a penalty turned down when @entity85 clearly handled his header in the second half			1
@entity47 equalised for @entity10 who should have been grateful to get out of the @entity126 with a point			1
despite admitting that @entity24 were the better team , however , @entity128 was left frustrated with a third draw away from home over @entity131			0
‘ i ’m not interested in a period of unbeaten , because i ’m in a process , ’ said the @entity10 manager			0
‘ we have to win away games and we did n’t do that			0
’ @entity128 had complained about the demands of the festive fixture list in @entity140 , and his mood was not helped by the sight of @entity87 limping out of his fourth game in 13 days with a pulled hamstring			2
@entity30 blows a kiss after giving @entity24 the lead against @entity1 's @entity10 at the @entity9 @entity24 went ahead in the second minute of the @entity55 match against @entity10 in the first game on @entity12 @entity24 's @entity73 ( left ) could have doubled @entity24 's lead when he dispossessed @entity86 ( right ) to have a shot on goal inside the box @entity73 was frustrated after he could and should have doubled @entity24 's lead before @entity10 equalised in the 26th minute @entity87 is expected to be out for up to a month while @entity10 ’s other first - choice wing - back , @entity154 , did not even make the trip on thursday because of a thigh strain			1
@entity128 was even less happy with the way his team fell behind to a set - piece behind inside two minutes			0
@entity70 fired over a corner from the right , @entity27 rose above a static @entity89 to head goalwards and @entity30 was completely unmarked to turn and hook the ball home			1
‘ we ’ve had two meetings about that , ’ said @entity128			0
‘ we know that @entity27 is doing that and they were totally free without any opponent in the neighbourhood so that was very bad			0
’ if there was one consolation for @entity10 , this was the kind of game they would have lost last season			0
in fact they did , a 2 - 1 defeat by @entity17 ’s side in february still their only loss in 14 @entity55 encounters with @entity24			1
they lost @entity84 and @entity86 to injuries before half - time that day , and both players had a bumpy ride alongside @entity85 in the first half here			1
@entity24 used the wind to hang up long balls and asked @entity73 and @entity27 to chase down @entity10 ’s back - three			1
@entity86 , in particular , almost paid for the price for allowing @entity70 ’s punt to bounce several times towards his own penalty box in the 19th minute , inviting @entity73 to muscle him off the ball and go through on goal			2
it was an excellent chance for the former @entity10 striker to double @entity24 ’s lead but he curled a shot well wide of @entity36 ’s goal			1
@entity47 gets among the melee of players and sweeps the ball into the back of the net to make it 1 - 1 against @entity24 @entity10 celebrate as the ball makes its way past @entity24 goalkeeper @entity64 to set the game at 1 - 1 @entity47 runs away in celebration after equalising for @entity10 against @entity24 on @entity12 at the @entity9 @entity211 celebrates after @entity10 came from behind to make it 1 - 1 at an extremely windy @entity9 @entity10 will make a decision about the option to buy @entity47 in april and not in the next few days			1
click here to read the full story ‘ he made a bit of a mess of it and i was thankful for that , ’ admitted a relieved @entity86			0
‘ the ball kept holding up in the wind and you had to break your stride sometimes to let it drop			0
i said to @entity73 , “ is it like this every week ? ” and he said it is			0
’ @entity10 were level seven minutes later and it infuriated @entity17 that his old club scored from a corner of their own			1
@entity60 swung over a cross from the left , @entity39 managed to flick the ball on and @entity47 was lurking on the edge of the six - yard box to guide it past @entity64			2
it was the @entity236 ’s third goal in 12 games for @entity10 and , surprisingly , @entity39 ’s first @entity55 assist since @entity238 2012			2
@entity128 sent on @entity90 and @entity91 for @entity47 and @entity89 , but that was the precursor to a period of ferocious @entity24 precious that should have brought a winner			2
after @entity84 was forced to head narrowly wide of his own goal , the resulting corner from @entity70 picked out @entity27 who headed goalwards			2
the ball clearly hit @entity85 ’s outstretched left arm from some distance but referee @entity100 waved away @entity24 ’s furious claims for a penalty			1
@entity24 goalkeeper @entity64 catches the ball but appears to lift his foot high intentionally as the approaching @entity253 closes him down @entity92 and @entity64 exchange words after the striker felt the goalkeeper intentionally left a high foot on him @entity92 embraces @entity64 to let the goalkeeper know what he thinks ( left ) before @entity30 intervenes ( right ) during the match @entity39 's flick - on for @entity47 ’s goal was his first @entity55 assist since @entity238 2012			1
moments later , @entity27 beat @entity85 to @entity70 ’s freekick and flicked a header towards the back post with @entity211 beaten			1
agonisingly , it came back off the post and @entity73 ’s follow - up effort went over the bar			0
‘ i think @entity24 were closer to the victory with the ball on the post , and the first chance from @entity73 was also not a little chance , ’ conceded @entity128			2
‘ so they had two major chances and we did n’t create so much in spite of the time and space			0
‘ but it ’s more difficult because we are not so tall			0
( @entity280 ) @entity68 is taller and @entity27 is taller , so it ’s not so easy			0
the opponent is always taller than us			0
’ so can we expect @entity10 to sign some taller players in the transfer window ? ‘ no , ’ he replied			0
‘ we want to play another kind of football to @entity24			0
’ @entity87 is helped off in the second after as he is substituted after appearing to injure his hamstring at the @entity9 @entity85 's handball went unpunished by referee @entity100 during the @entity55 match on @entity12 @entity24 appeal to referee @entity292 for a penalty after the handball by @entity85 at the @entity9 on @entity12 @entity24 manager @entity17 applauds the fans at the @entity9 as his side faced @entity10 in the early @entity12 kick - off			1

an unmarked @entity30 scored the opening goal in the second minute for @entity24
@entity47 equalised in similar style to the @entity24 defender from a corner in the 26th minute
the teams went in level at 1 - 1 at half time at a @entity9 *dominated* by wind
@entity85 got away with a handball in the box at 1 - 1 before @entity27 hit the post from a header
@entity10 's @entity87 was substituted in the 75th minute with what appeared to be a hamstring injury
