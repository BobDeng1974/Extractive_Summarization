by @entity0 published : 08:12 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 08:16 est , 28 may 2012 @entity2 television company @entity1 has unveiled a camera that captures and ' digests ' four billion pixels per second - capturing 33 - megapixel footage at 120 frames per second			1
to put that in context , the camera in @entity9 is eight megapixels , and cinema reels run at 24 frames per second			0
companies such as @entity15 are already unveiling televisions and projectors with resolutions above 1080p hd - the highest currently possible - and @entity22 's new film @entity20 will be shot in 48 frames per second and @entity24 , about four times sharper than @entity19			1
the cameras are built to showcase @entity1 's new ' @entity27 ' format and can capture four billion pixels per second - shooting at 33 megapixels and up to 120 frames per second @entity31 as @entity32 in @entity20 - being shot in @entity24 at 48 frames per second , one of several new formats designed to ' beyond ' hd @entity1 's camera is a demonstration model for its @entity38 ' - one of several competing resolutions designed to take televisions beyond hi - def. companies such as @entity42 are already shooting films in @entity24 - a super-high - def resolution touted as the ' next generation ' of high definition			1
but @entity1 's camera is even more extreme - shooting in bursts up to 120 frames per second , at a resolution of 33 megapixels			1
like the @entity24 cameras used in films , the amount of computing power required is so great that the devices are still bulky			0
several different standards for resolutions ' above hd ' will be trialled this year at the @entity56 - with the @entity57 filming some events in @entity15 's £ 7,000 @entity59 is the first consumer tv with the technology - although there are no video players on the market capable of showing anything in @entity24 , or even any discs stored in the format			2
there are several resolutions - which could become competing formats , in a similar vein to the battle between @entity73 and @entity74 - from the relatively modest @entity75 up to @entity76			0
there are few devices that can play the format , thus far - although if your pc is up to it , @entity80 will host @entity24 footage			0
@entity1 's camera is a demonstration model for its @entity38 ' - one of several competing resolutions designed to take televisions beyond hi - def yours for a mere £ 7000 : @entity15 's ' naked eye ' 3d set will be 55 inches , and capable of ' @entity90 - a super-hi - def format four times the resolution of current hd sets many films are already shot using @entity95 's @entity94 was shot and screened in @entity24 , and an increasing number of cinema films use the format .			2
