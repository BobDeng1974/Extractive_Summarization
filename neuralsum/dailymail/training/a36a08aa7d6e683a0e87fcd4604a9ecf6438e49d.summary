by @entity0 a trial is to be held entirely in secret for the first time in @entity5 history			1
two men accused of a terror plot will go into the dock at the @entity9 in weeks			1
for undisclosed reasons of national security their identities , as well as details of their alleged crimes , will not be heard in public			1
the very existence of the trial can be disclosed today only because the @entity18 fought with other media groups to have the reporting restrictions lifted			1
two men accused of a terror plot will go into the dock at the @entity9 , pictured , within in weeks - but their identity and alleged crimes will not be made public due to undisclosed reasons of national security the casting aside of the centuries - old doctrine of open courts sparked anger last night			1
‘ to hold trials entirely in secret is an outrageous assault on the fundamental principles of @entity5 justice , ’ said @entity30 of @entity31			1
‘ this government ’s dangerous obsession with secret courts seems to know no bounds			0
unless it is resisted , we risk ending up with a justice system that will not be worthy of the name			2
’ @entity44 , @entity45 chairman of the @entity47 home affairs committee , said : ‘ for a parliamentary democracy with our reputation for a fair legal system , this sets a very dangerous precedent			0
‘ for an entire trial to be heard in camera , this is unprecedented , very serious and worrying			2
’ the @entity56 was urged by the media groups ’ lawyer to restrict the secrecy order because it represented a ‘ totally unprecedented departure from the principles of open justice ’			1
justice secretary @entity63 insisted it was a ' matter for the courts ' but stressed sitting in secret should be ' very , very rare indeed '			2
he told @entity69 's today programme : ' the default in our justice system should be transparency , we should not see situations where a large amount of the process in our courts system suddenly becomes secret			2
' but the law does allow very rare occasions where trials or parts of trials can take place in private			0
this is always a matter for the judges			0
' but what i would say is i know our senior judiciary well , i know they will want to protect the interests of justice and i 'm very confident that if they take a decision on a difficult matter like this they will be doing so in the interests of justice			2
' the existence of the @entity9 trial has only come to light because the @entity18 and other media groups have campaigned for reporting restrictions to be lifted @entity102 , mr justice @entity103 and mr @entity104 said they would make a decision within days			1
the @entity18 has campaigned to expose the threat to democracy and openness that secret courts represent			2
there has been huge controversy around closed family courts , super injunctions and civil cases involving national security			1
prior to yesterday , the media was banned from even reporting that the trial of the two men , known only as @entity120 and @entity121 , was due to take place in conditions of total secrecy			1
@entity120 is accused of ‘ engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts ’			2
both men are accused of possessing terrorist documents , including a file named ‘ bomb making ’ held on a memory stick			2
@entity121 faces a fourth charge under immigration laws of improperly obtaining a @entity5 passport			2
chairman of the @entity47 home affairs committee @entity44 said the ' serious and worrying ' move set a ' very dangerous precedent ' senior prosecutors claim the trial may not go ahead if it has to be held in public			1
but they have refused to disclose publicly the need for total secrecy			0
@entity145 , representing the media organisations , branded this position ‘ unreasonable ’ and ‘ unrealistic ’			0
he said national security should not be pursued without regard for the values of the society it is trying to protect			1
‘ this appeal raises important issues relating to not only the constitutional principle of open justice , but also the equally important principle of fairness and natural justice , ’ he added			0
‘ this case is a test of the court ’s commitment to that constitutional principle in the admittedly difficult and sensitive cases where the state seeks to have trials involving terrorism heard in secret and relies in support of that on the grounds of national security			1
‘ it is unprecedented that the trial of two defendants charged with serious terrorism offences should take place entirely in private with the identities of both defendants withheld			0
‘ no order has ever been made which requires an entire criminal trial to be held in private , with the media excluded and defendants anonymous			1
’ commenting on the case , @entity184 of @entity185 said transparency was not ‘ an optional luxury in the justice system ’			0
she added : ‘ this case is a worrying high water mark for secrecy in our courts			0
‘ there must be clearer explanations before the door is shut on press and public			0
’ criminal cases are heard in open courts which the public and media can attend			0
reporting restrictions sometimes cover specific parts of cases , but no previous trial has been held entirely in secret			1
the @entity209 enables cases to be heard behind closed doors but the legislation is rarely used in this way			0
liberty director @entity184 was also critical of the move , saying transparency was not ' an optional luxury in the justice system ' the power to hold a trial in secret comes from common law and is not covered by recent terrorist legislation			1
@entity223 , who will prosecute the two men , said the @entity225 supported open justice			2
but he said ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ had led to the request for secrecy			0
in 2008 , the @entity9 heard parts of a murder trial in secret on grounds of national security			1
but the defendant , @entity235 , who battered recluse @entity236 to death , was named and most of the case was heard in public			0
the trial of @entity5 ’s most notorious double agent , @entity243 , was held partly in secret in the early 1960s			1
charged under the @entity209 , he was sentenced to 42 years for passing secrets to the @entity247			0
the @entity18 has campaigned to expose the threat to democracy and openness that secret courts represent last year , the president of the @entity253 launched a stinging attack on secret justice , saying it is ‘ not justice at all ’			1
@entity258 said hearing evidence behind closed doors was ‘ against the principle of justice ’			0
he said that other than in exceptional circumstances judges should treat requests to hear cases in closed courts with ‘ distaste and concern ’			0
his comments came after a bitter row over @entity271 plans to introduce the @entity272			0
this formally enshrined secret hearings and judgments in the legal system , a radical departure from centuries of tradition			0

two men accused of terror plot are to appear at the @entity9 in @entity286
identity and alleged crimes not made public ' for reasons of national security '
trial disclosed because @entity18 , @entity294 and *broadcasters* fought for reporting restrictions to be lifted
critics have described the move as an ' outrageous assault on @entity5 justice '
decision on whether to restrict secrecy order expected within days
