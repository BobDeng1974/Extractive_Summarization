the ‘ bad ’ type of cholesterol – which causes heart disease – is linked to @entity4 ’s , researchers have found			1
such cholesterol has previously been associated with a narrowing of the arteries			0
now a study has revealed that the bad type is related to the amyloid peptide protein in the brain , which is present in @entity4 ’s			1
a study has revealed that the bad type of cholesterol - which causes heart disease - is related to the amyloid peptide protein ( pictured ) in the brain , which is present in @entity4 's in patients affected by disease , clumps of the protein stick to brain cells , affecting memory , mood and behaviour			1
the discovery may explain the well - known link between raised cholesterol and an increased risk of @entity4 ’s			1
researchers found the link depended on whether people had more good cholesterol , known as high density lipoprotein ( @entity31 ) , or the bad form called low density lipoprotein ( @entity34 )			1
high levels of @entity34 can lead to narrowed arteries and heart disease , whereas @entity31 is protective			2
the new @entity39 research suggests the two kinds of cholesterol have the same effect on the brain as on the heart			0
study leader professor @entity45 , from the @entity46 , said : ‘ unhealthy patterns of cholesterol could be directly causing the higher levels of amyloid known to contribute to @entity4 ’s , in the same way that such patterns promote heart disease			1
’ the discovery may explain the well - known link between raised cholesterol and an increased risk of @entity4 's ( stock picture ) the scientists looked at 74 men and women aged 70 and over			0
all had brain scans using a tracer chemical that binds with amyloid plaques in order to highlight them on the images			0
higher fasting levels of @entity34 and lower levels of @entity31 were both associated with more amyloid in the brain , according to the findings published online in the journal @entity72			2
professor @entity45 said : ‘ this study provides a reason to certainly continue cholesterol treatment in people who are developing memory loss , regardless of concerns regarding their cardiovascular health			0
’ fellow author dr @entity80 said the discovery was a ‘ wake - up call ’ for those with a poor cholesterol balance			0
dr @entity85 , of @entity86 , said : ‘ the findings add to existing evidence that cholesterol could play a role in the @entity4 ’s disease process			2
‘ the best way to keep our brain healthy is to eat a balanced diet , maintain a healthy weight , not smoke , exercise regularly and keep blood pressure and cholesterol in check			0

low density lipoprotein ( @entity34 ) has been associated with narrowing arteries
it is related to amyloid peptide protein in brain , present in @entity4 ’s
clumps of protein stick to brain cells , affecting memory , mood and behaviour
