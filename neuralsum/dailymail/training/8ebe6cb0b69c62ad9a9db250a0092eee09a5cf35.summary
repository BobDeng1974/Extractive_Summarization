@entity0 believes a fight with @entity2 would be even bigger than a clash between @entity4 and @entity5			1
@entity2 outclassed @entity6 in @entity7 on saturday night to be crowned @entity9 's first heavyweight world champion since 2006			1
he immediately targeted a fight with fellow motormouth @entity0 who admitted he would relish the challenge			1
@entity2 saw off @entity6 to be crowned @entity15 heavyweight champion on saturday @entity2 was untroubled for large parts of the fight but when he was caught , showed he could take a punch @entity2 runs to the ropes to celebrate after the final bell ( left ) and shows off his new @entity15 heavyweight belt ' @entity2 did a good job on @entity23 and he 's now got the @entity15 title , ' he said			1
' that puts him in line for big fights against people like me , @entity30 and whoever else			2
' @entity9 has a new heavyweight champion of the world and the big boys are back in the division			1
the division has been set on fire again			2
' it was definitely the result i wanted			2
@entity6 , although a good champion , was a bit of an unknown			1
nobody knew who he was and nobody cared			0
now @entity9 has a new heavyweight champion			1
@entity0 ( right ) - who @entity2 wants to fight next - easily beat @entity46 in a world title bout in november ' also , @entity2 's undefeated and a knockout artist			1
that means the division has been given a lift and we 're all back in business			0
' i do n't like @entity2 and he does n't like me			1
i think he 's a big hype - job			2
' we once had a bit of a falling out in @entity57 at one of @entity60 's boxing shows and i told him one day i will get him in the ring and knock him out			2
that is still my plan			0
' fury is the mandatory challenger to world champion @entity30 who holds the three other major belts			1
@entity0 celebrates beating @entity46 for the @entity67 @entity66 back in november and he believes he will one day be crowned the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world			1
' in an ideal world i 'd like to fight @entity30 first , because he 's got most of the belts and he 's the no 1 in the division , and then i 'd like to unify all the titles against @entity2 , ' @entity0 added			1
' potentially , i 'm three or four fights away from being the unified heavyweight champion of the world			1
' it would be the biggest selling fight with the greatest smack talk in heavyweight history			2
' no other fight could come close to it			0
it would be pure entertainment			0
@entity30 's last bout ended with a fifth - round knockout win over @entity87 in november 2014 ' back in the ( @entity90 ) @entity89 days , there was only one man doing the talking			2
the others would n't talk			0
this is different , though			0
we can both talk , we both play the press and we are both natural born entertainers			0
that 's why it 's the biggest fight out there as far as i 'm concerned			0
' it 's not just the biggest fight in the heavyweight division , it 's the biggest fight in world boxing			1
' i 'm a big puncher , he 's a big puncher , and it 's just a matter of who lands first			0
i would n't go out there to try and outbox somebody who is probably quicker than me			0
i 'd go out there to switch his lights off			0
i 'd look to demolish him early			0
' there 'd be a guaranteed knockout in the early rounds			0
either way , it will be over very fast			0
