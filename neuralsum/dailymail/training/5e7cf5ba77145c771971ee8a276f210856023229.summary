scary ? @entity10 sent his teenaged nephew into a @entity11 intersection dressed in mock terrorist garb and carrying a fake grenade launcher in july and says it was to test the local authorities ' response time crusader ? @entity10 could face five years or more in jail for the stunt , but his attorney is pushing for a probation sentence @entity10 told an officer who arrived at the scene that he and his 16 - year - old nephew , who was wrapped in a baby blue sheet , were filming a movie			1
they were not arrested at that point			0
@entity10 's video commentary makes a point of this , suggesting the officer , who told @entity10 to put the camera down , was n't concerned enough about the possibility it was an actual terrorist attack			2
however , after the @entity56 video he posted of the stunt made the rounds online , @entity10 was arrested and charged with giving a false impression of a terrorist act , according to abc15.com			1
in the @entity56 video , @entity10 said he wanted to see how long it would take authorities to respond to a terrorist situation and mentioned a movie theater shooting two weeks earlier that killed 12 people in @entity66 , @entity67 he was also charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and ‘ misconduct of simulated explosive devices			2
’ sentencing is set for aug. 8			0

' my client is in shock			0
' slow response : @entity10 and his nephew walked around a @entity11 , @entity12 neighborhood hoping to attract the attention of police but were disappointed no one seemed afraid in a @entity56 video that @entity10 made of the hoax , his young relative was dressed in a sheet , had a scarf wrapped around his head , made erratic movements while in a crosswalk and pointed the fake weapon at vehicles , prompting motorists to call 911			1
prosecutor @entity102 told jurors in closing arguments monday that @entity10 , who was responsible for his nephew 's safety that day , could have gotten his young relative killed in the hoax			2
@entity102 said some motorists who saw the teen with the realistic - looking fake launcher had discussions about whether they should run him over			0
still , some recordings of 911 calls also showed that some witnesses assumed the weapon was a fake			0
police response : police initially questioned @entity10 and his nephew but did n't seem concerned and did n't pursue it @entity77 said callers were n't terrified and instead figured they were witnessing a joke , pointing out that they could see his client filming the hoax and that his nephew did a brief dance while on the street corner			1
earlier in the trial that began june 11 , @entity77 told jurors that it was foolish for @entity10 to get his nephew involved but noted that no one was injured and no vehicles wrecked as a result of the hoax			2
