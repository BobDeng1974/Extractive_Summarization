judge @entity0 is ' concerned ' that @entity2 lawyer @entity1 is n't prepared to represent her @entity4 - who was present at pre-trial - either has to get another lawyer or she has to come into court and waive her right to a competent @entity8 lawyer he vehemently blocks @entity1 's attempt to put back trial from march 18 to april 1 ' in the interest of justice , my client needs that time , ' @entity1 maintained by @entity16 published : 13:00 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 16:09 est , 1 march 2013 ' give her leeway to show that she 's worth of compassion , ' @entity1 pleaded with judge @entity0 this morning in a bid to get @entity22 's latest criminal case thrown out			1
the @entity2 based lawyer even played the victim card , telling judge @entity0 that ' there seems to be some doubt as to whether @entity22 is entitled to some mercy because of her history with this department			1
' but the judge was n't buying it , and he steadfastly refused to allow @entity1 to persuade him to move the trial date from march 18 to april 1			1
unsuitable ? judge @entity0 told @entity22 's lawyer that he was not versed sufficiently in @entity8 law to represent her properly at trial as he threw his attempts to have lying to police claims thrown out during this morning 's pre-trial hearing noting that it was also @entity41 , @entity0 pointed out that april 1st is a court holiday and said he saw no merit in postponing the reckoning			1

he added that @entity1 had not prepared adequately given his lack of competence in @entity8 law , which meant prosecutor @entity72 's trial date remained in place			1
he told @entity74 his concerns about police not reading @entity4 her @entity78 rights were of no concern , either , as @entity4 's fourth amendment rights had not been violated			2
@entity0 also emphasized to @entity1 that he needs to take local guidance before trial and that @entity4 will suffer if she does n't have a legal team who fully understand @entity8 law			1
her father @entity85 was , as always , quick to comment on the matter to @entity87 , he said : ' this guy is a loser and will drag her down			0
' i already started to pray to @entity91 that @entity4 fires him before it 's too late , ' he added before explaining he has another lawyer lined up			1

facing the music : @entity1 's pleas for ' compassion ' and ' mercy ' fell on deaf ears and @entity4 will face trial on march 18 details of the apparent deal surfaced after the @entity2 - based attorney sent an emotional letter pleading with prosecutors to help the ' deeply broken ' actress			1
@entity1 reveals that @entity4 is undergoing extensive psychiatric therapy and is struggling to overcome a history of family issues , and urges @entity151 and @entity152 attorneys @entity72 and @entity153 to join forces with him to become the team that ' fix ' the actress			1
sent on february 4 and obtained by @entity87 , the letter was also sent to the judge presiding over the case			0
@entity1 , who came onto the case after @entity22 fired her long - term attorney , @entity161 , earlier this year , wrote the prosecutors need to understand that his client 's problems are even deeper than what is publicly known			1
on her way : @entity22 and her mother @entity168 head to the car crash case pre-trial hearing on january 30 ' i have known @entity4 for many years and have witnessed the dynamics of her family and her experiences that are not known to general public , and which have deeply impacted her and resulted in certain events in her life that has bought her before the @entity178 and derivatively to your attention and professional assessment , ' he is quoted			2
' yet , as i noted at our meeting these prior events and their portrayal in the media , regrettably always results in distortion , creating a very negative public persona without consideration of what happened in @entity4 's life that bought her to that place and without considering the pain , torment and confusion which @entity4 has experienced and been affected with			2
' the lawyer promises , alongside @entity4 's psychotherapist , to reveal just how bad things have become for the @entity201 actress as he says that without knowing , the prosecutors are ' handicapped because he could you propose to fix something without known just how broken it was '			2
' the only way we as a " team " are going to formulate a solution is for @entity4 , her psychotherapist and i provide a true window revealing the real problems we must solve , ' the letter reportedly continues			0

' which is why i appeal to your good conscious to join me in not rubber stamping this case but rather to be patient and understanding and open to productive alternatives as we , as a team , help fix @entity22 , ' the letter continues			0
