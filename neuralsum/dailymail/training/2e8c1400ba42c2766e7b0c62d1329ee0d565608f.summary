by @entity0 published : 11:56 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 14:52 est , 5 november 2012 @entity1 told voters in a bullish speech as he today stormed into the final day of campaigning before @entity5 in the @entity6 : ' i may be full of grey hair now , but i ’m just as motivated as i was four years ago			2
we ’ve come too far to turn back			0
’ ahead of tomorrow ’s big day , the president and his @entity12 rival @entity11 once again visited the country ’s toughest battleground state in @entity15 , which has picked the winner of the last 12 elections			1
it came as mr @entity11 pulled ahead of president @entity1 in the key @entity20 daily tracking poll			1
it gave the @entity12 a one - point lead by 49 to 48 per cent			1
the same survey had them tied yesterday			0
mr @entity11 was also given a two - point lead in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity15 - but a national poll of more than 36,000 voters in 27 states said the president will win re-election by two percentage points			1
that gives him an easier path to the 270 electoral votes needed for victory			0
no @entity12 has won without @entity15 , and mr @entity11 could still make a late visit there on @entity5			1
the winner is not determined by the nationwide popular vote but in state - by - state contests , making nine ‘ battleground ’ states that do n't consistently vote either way very important in such a tight race			1
winning a state gives mr @entity11 or president @entity1 that state 's electoral votes , which are apportioned to states based on a mix of population and representation in @entity66			1
there is a chance of a replay of 2000 , when @entity12 @entity70 won the presidency with an electoral vote majority while @entity74 @entity73 had a narrow lead in the nationwide popular vote			0
battle : president @entity1 ( left ) starts to move to the music of performer @entity79 who was off - stage performing at the end of the campaign event yesterday in @entity82 ; while @entity11 ( right ) gestures as he greets supporters as he arrives at a @entity26 campaign rally at @entity86 , in @entity26 big fans : president @entity1 greets supporters after speaking at a campaign event at @entity90 yesterday in @entity91 , @entity26 all dressed up : @entity92 , of @entity93 , @entity15 , stands outside of @entity94 after vice president @entity95 had a campaign rally in @entity15 both president @entity1 and mr @entity11 say this year 's winner will be determined by who can get the most supporters to the polls			1
‘ this is going to be a turnout election , ’ the president said today			0
' i may be full of grey hair now , but i ’m just as motivated as i was four years ago			0
we ’ve come too far to turn back			0
i ’m not weary ' president @entity1 president @entity1 ’s campaign knows that the feeling of making history by electing @entity6 's first black president that fired up the 2008 campaign has cooled			1
rock legend @entity113 and rapper @entity114 were joining @entity1 for @entity15 events today			1
‘ we have one job left , ’ and that 's getting people out to vote , mr @entity11 told a @entity26 crowd this morning			2
the crowd chanted , ‘ one more day ! ’ mr @entity11 , who described himself as ‘ severely conservative ’ during the @entity12 primary campaign , is now appealing to the centre and highlighting his ‘ bipartisan record ’ as @entity127 governor			0
here we go : bags filled with voting supplies wait to be doubled checked prior being sent to precincts in @entity131 , @entity132 , today explained : election volunteer @entity133 ( left ) talks to first - time volunteer @entity134 ( right ) as they prepare to double check voting supplies in @entity131 backing : @entity137 , 32 , puts the finishing touches to a hat painted with the flags of the @entity6 and @entity141 and reading ' @entity1 for president ' in @entity143 , @entity141 he continues to insist that his experience as a businessman would help fix the still - weak @entity6 economy - a top issue with voters			2
president @entity1 meanwhile has come back from a weak performance in his first of three debates with mr @entity11 last month and hammered at his rival ’s shifting positions			2
' one more day ! ' @entity154 's chant at @entity11 event in @entity26 the final national @entity157 / @entity156 , released yesterday , showed president @entity1 with the support of 48 per cent of likely voters , with mr @entity11 receiving 47 per cent			1
the final national poll from the @entity161 found president @entity1 with a three - point edge over mr @entity11 of 48 per cent to 45 per cent			1
this was an improved showing that indicates the president may have benefited from his handling of the response to last week 's @entity168			0
he suspended three full days of campaigning to deal with the @entity171 disaster			0
vote for me : @entity6 @entity12 presidential nominee and former @entity127 governor @entity11 speaks today at a campaign rally in @entity175 , @entity26 child 's play : a boy in the audience holds a puppet of @entity12 presidential nominee @entity11 today at a campaign rally at the airport in @entity175 , @entity26 even babies are involved : supporters of @entity6 @entity12 presidential nominee @entity11 attend a campaign rally today in @entity175 , @entity26 supporter : former president @entity186 , right , speaks at a rally for @entity1 yesterday at @entity188 in @entity189 , @entity132 if the election were held now , an @entity191 analysis found president @entity1 would be all but assured of 249 electoral votes by carrying 20 states that are solidly @entity195 or leaning his way and the @entity197			1
mr @entity11 would lay claim to 206 , from probable victories in 24 states that are strong @entity12 ground or tilt toward the @entity12			2
up for grabs are 83 electoral votes spread across @entity205 , @entity26 , @entity15 , @entity206 , @entity25 and @entity207			0
of those , @entity12 and @entity195 alike say president @entity1 seems in slightly better shape than mr @entity11 in @entity15 and @entity207 , while mr @entity11 appears to be performing slightly better than president @entity1 or has pulled even in @entity25 and @entity26			1
with president @entity1 sustaining his lead in @entity15 , mr @entity11 has made a surprise , last - minute move in neighbouring @entity213			1
the state has voted @entity195 in the last five presidential elections and has long been counted in the president @entity1 column			0
mr @entity11 made his first visit of the autumn campaign yesterday			0
the theme from the movie ‘ @entity221 ’ blared from the loudspeakers as he stepped to the podium in a @entity225 suburb			0
‘ the people of @entity6 understand we 're taking back the @entity229 because we 're going to win @entity213 , ’ mr @entity11 told a large crowd on a cold night			2
president @entity1 's campaign said mr @entity11 's move in @entity213 showed the @entity12 's desperation over his diminished chances in @entity15			1
and the @entity1 campaign announced that former president @entity186 - president @entity1 's most powerful surrogate - would make four campaign stops in @entity213 today			2
about 30million people have already cast ballots in 34 states and the @entity197 , although none will be counted until @entity5			0
storm - hit @entity242 and @entity243 hurried to make voting accessible in a region where more than 1million remain without power			0
but the states are seen by both campaigns to be heavily in favour of the president			0
