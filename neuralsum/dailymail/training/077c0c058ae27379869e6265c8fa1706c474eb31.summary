@entity0 are less than 12 months away from a home @entity2 but have just lost four tests on the trot to @entity5 and one to @entity6			1
the game with @entity8 on saturday week is now ‘ must - win ’			2
but do the southern - hemisphere nations agree that @entity0 are in crisis ? @entity12 asked three legends … @entity14 ( 72 - cap @entity8 fly half , 1991 @entity2 winner ) @entity14 won the 1991 @entity2 it ’s not time to press the panic button just yet but there was not a lot of creativity in @entity0 ’s play at the weekend			1
that played into @entity6 ’s hands because they ’re a physical side that love people running straight at them			1
@entity28 has n’t played a lot of rugby this season and it ’s not an easy task to find your feet against @entity5 and the @entity6			1
maybe he was n’t quite ready			0
i think there ’s an option to have @entity38 come in at @entity39 , with @entity28 at 12			0
it gives you more options with kicking and also two ball - players that can stand either side of the ruck			0
@entity28 is very strong at inside centre and he ’s used to playing alongside @entity48 , who has been at 13			0
maybe it ’s time for @entity50 to have a go at scrum half against @entity53 and show us what he ’s got , but the most important thing is getting a win over @entity8			1
@entity28 has been criticised for his displays against @entity5 and @entity6 the @entity59 fly half could be moved to inside centre , but seems unlikely to start the next game at 10 @entity62 ( 92 - cap former @entity5 skipper ) @entity62 is a legendary @entity5 @entity0 are going through a building phase but they will be disappointed with the performance against @entity6			1
they should be a bit harder on themselves but , in the context of where they were three years ago , they have made huge strides			0
as fans here we want @entity0 to win and the nice thing is now people are expecting them to win			1
injuries have not helped their cause and @entity6 at @entity77 is a game they would have targeted as a win			1
the fact that southern - hemisphere players are being contracted to their union also certainly helps , especially in the autumn			0
it makes them almost like a club team			2
that ’s where the northern hemisphere are going to struggle against the southern hemisphere			0
perhaps the @entity92 should look to buy out the clubs			0
@entity38 , who came on in both games , could start for @entity0 in the next fixture against @entity53 @entity96 ( former @entity6 and @entity97 full back ) @entity96 played 18 times for @entity6 the guys all looked very nervous at @entity77 and @entity0 must learn to handle the pressure and expectation that will come over the next 12 months			1
@entity6 had less possession and territory in the first half but capitalised on ill - discipline and unforced errors — a lot of that is down to pressure and in particular the decision - making at 9 , 10 and 12			1
unfortunately pressure is building on the @entity0 set - up from all angles			2
how they handle that will be crucial to their chances of winning the @entity2			0
they can go out for a beer , but if they get caught out by the media and then the result does n’t go their way , then it becomes the wrong thing to do			0
but it can swing both ways and @entity0 have to find that balance between focus and relaxation very quickly			2
@entity0 could call on @entity50 to help break the malaise in the half - back positions the @entity133 on @entity134 are part of an unrivalled schedule of rugby union with over 360 matches from the international , @entity140 and domestic game .			2

@entity0 suffered *defeats* to @entity5 and @entity6
@entity145 *'s* team face @entity53 next weekend
