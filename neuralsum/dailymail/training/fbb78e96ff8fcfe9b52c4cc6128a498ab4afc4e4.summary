former @entity1 captain @entity0 - who was in the last @entity1 team to face @entity3 on @entity5 soil , in november 1999 - insists that @entity3 remain a force to be reckoned with on the international stage , despite @entity9 ’s men being a national embarrassment at the @entity11			1
@entity0 played in both legs of the @entity14 qualifying play - off 15 years ago			1
in the first leg at @entity16 , two goals from @entity18 put @entity3 2 - 0 up			1
@entity1 then shocked @entity3 at @entity19 , winning 1 - 0 , a deserved victory but not enough for progress			1
the fortunes of both international sides have dipped since then			0
@entity1 have not been to any major finals since the @entity25 ’ 98 @entity11			1
@entity3 have reached the quarter - finals at @entity27 but the limp winless exit from @entity29 showed how low their stock has fallen			1
@entity33 , in action against @entity32 , is just one of the talents @entity3 can boast , says @entity0 @entity35 is @entity3 's finest player in a generation , according to the former @entity1 captain but @entity0 insists @entity3 have a crop of players many nations envy - and they will come good in time			1
‘ @entity41 , @entity33 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 - these are talents any country in the world would be interested in , ’ he says			1
‘ it ’s a bit of myth that there is little or no talent there			0
it ’s a matter of letting it come to fruition			0
‘ pick a team , stand by it , give it a chance to bond and have faith instead of chopping and changing after a couple of bad games			0
‘ and then there ’s @entity35 , who is the best player @entity3 have had in a generation			2
’ @entity0 know the young @entity35 when they both played for @entity65			1
‘ at 15 years old , he was confident , sure of himself , a nice guy , worked hard , trained hard , loved football , ’ @entity0 says			2
‘ he ’s the same now			0
he ’ll play anywhere , he ’s got great qualities as a player			0
’ @entity0 was a 29 - year - old centre - half in his first full season at @entity65 when @entity1 lost the play - off double - header in 1999			1
he is now the 44 - year - old assistant manager at @entity75 , having played in a @entity77 final and won silverware at @entity78 and been @entity80 manager in between			2
@entity0 tackles @entity3 striker @entity81 on the way to losing 2 - 0 with @entity1 at @entity16 in 1999 @entity0 is now assistant manager at @entity75 side @entity75 having managed @entity80 he has seen @entity1 ’s fortunes dwindle over the past 15 years , although he believes they may have turned a corner , and he has seen @entity3 ’s dwindle too , although insists @entity3 have not fallen as far as many perceive			1
and as the pair prepare to face each other at @entity89 in tonight ’s friendly , he thinks the way in which the respective domestic leagues have become tougher to crack for home - grown players may be one reason their national sides have faltered			1
‘ the level in the @entity97 certainly got higher , and it got harder for [ @entity99 ] players to get games , ’ he says			0
‘ it got harder in the @entity102 too			0
i ’m not sure the level got higher there but it got harder for a young @entity5 player to get a game because there were more foreign players , and bigger money to foreign players			0
‘ looking back now that did n’t necessarily help @entity1 in the long term			2
’ @entity18 leaps to head in his second goal as @entity3 beat @entity1 2 - 0 in the @entity14 play - off the @entity16 leg in 1999 was ‘ an occasion of huge magnitude ’ , @entity0 says			1
‘ @entity1 at the time were used to qualifying for major championships			2
we ’d been at @entity120 and the @entity11 in 1998 so were expecting to go to the @entity121 again in 2000			0
so it was massive pair of games and one we thought we had a chance in			0
’ @entity3 ’s @entity126 still was still formidable enough that many rival nations would have coveted the spine : @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity18 , @entity132			2
@entity133 was on the wing			0
it was the day before @entity18 ’s 25th birthday and he scored his first goal in the 21st minute from a cross by @entity139 on the right , chesting down in the ‘ d ’ , running on and lashing home right - foot from the edge of the six - yard box			0
@entity3 manager @entity145 jumped in joy , arms aloft , as he did when @entity18 got his second , this time from a @entity133 cross , a header converted six yards out			2
@entity132 , @entity129 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity133 , @entity18 , @entity153 and @entity81 line up for @entity3 at @entity16 with the spine of a team most nations would have coveted ‘ a bit of quality , ’ recalls @entity0 , summing up the difference in the sides back then			1
‘ a massive atmosphere went from being very big to very quiet , very quickly			0
’ @entity1 ’s captain was @entity163 , and alongside @entity0 were seasoned @entity5 players with big - tournament experience - @entity165 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170			1
‘ he said after we lost the first leg we still had a chance at @entity19 , ’ @entity0 recalls			2
@entity1 famously won , @entity169 scoring and @entity177 almost making it two			2
@entity0 says @entity1 have the ability for another upset today			1
‘ i think we ’re competitive again now , ’ he says			0
@entity0 thinks the ‘ friendly ’ nature of the match will favour @entity1			1
‘ [ in competitive games ] maybe @entity1 are a bit more emotional and caught up in the atmosphere rather than clinical and executing a plan , ’ he says			0
‘ being a friendly will maybe relax things a bit , let them play with freedom and not get caught up in the emotion			0
’ not like 15 years ago .			0
