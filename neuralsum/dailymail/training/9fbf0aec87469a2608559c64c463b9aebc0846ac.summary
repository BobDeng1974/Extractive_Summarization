they are just tiny specks in a vast landscape of deep ridges which ripple spectacularly , making @entity4 's lowest , driest , and hottest place look like the surface of the moon or an alien planet			1
the handful of intrepid walkers are the only signs of life in the baron desert and give a breathtaking sense of scale to @entity15 in these pictures from @entity18 travel photographer @entity17			1
mr @entity17 was on a driving holiday through @entity15 , in @entity21 's @entity20 , when he spotted the walkers on one of the ridges			2
the 57 - year - old from @entity25 was there to photograph the sunrise but could not resist taking the set of snaps at @entity29 in @entity30			0
@entity18 travel photographer @entity17 caught an incredible sense of scale with these pictures taken while on a driving holiday through @entity15 , in @entity21 's @entity20 visiting the @entity29 at sunrise , mr @entity17 caught spectacular images of walkers set against giant ridges rippling through the valley @entity15 stretches across about 3,000 square miles and its highest point is @entity41 in the @entity42 which is 11,043 ft ( 3,366 metres ) tall			1
the average annual rainfall in the vast and baron @entity15 desert is just 60mm @entity29 is made up of sediments from @entity47 which dried up five million years ago - way before @entity15 was formed @entity29 is in the @entity30 - the lowest lowest point in @entity4 , at 282ft ( 86 metres ) below sea level @entity29 sits on the edge of @entity15 's @entity47 , which holds the air temperature record at 56.7 , recorded in july 10 , 1913			1
but temperatures can drop below freezing at night during the winter @entity15 got its name during the gold rush from prospectors who sought to cross the valley			0
although , the name may be misleading , with only one death recorded during the period			0
the oldest rocks in @entity62 in @entity21 are thought to be at least 1,700 million years old when mr @entity17 came across the walkers they were too bunched up			0
but he said : ' fortunately three disappeared over the ridge leaving the two walkers perfectly positioned to give some scale and context to the image ... i had my shot ' glacial lakes once filled @entity15 but about 10,500 years ago these lakes began to dry up , producing the desert environment seen today			2
