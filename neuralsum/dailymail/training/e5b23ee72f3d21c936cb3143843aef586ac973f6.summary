but after @entity0 read the post , which has been viewed more than 24million times , she realized it was not what it seemed			1
' i had the same reaction any woman would have when i first saw the title , ' she told @entity17			0
@entity0 , wife of @entity1 who wrote a blog post about his fear of commitment titled ' marriage is not for you , ' has admitted that her first reaction to the online article was negative when @entity1 began to struggle in his marriage of 18 months to @entity0 , who had became ever more dedicated to her graduate studies in theater , which led the couple to relocate to @entity28 , the @entity23 - native said he felt isolated and began to push @entity0 away			1
' we were living in the same house but we were growing apart , ' he said			0
when the tension culminated in an argument , @entity1 anticipated a blowout with a defensive @entity0			1
but instead , his wife responded with compassion			0
' i felt like i had two choices , i could react in anger and our relationship would get worse , or i could try and see past my own hurts and my own frustrations and try and see what @entity1 was feeling , ' she admitted			2
that moment reminded @entity1 of advice his father had shared before the couple married , when @entity1 felt ' paralyzing fear ' about whether he was making the ' right ' choice ' after @entity0 read the post , which has been viewed 24million times , she realized it was not what it seemed ' i had the same reaction any woman would have when i first saw the title , ' she told @entity17 ' i 'm going to make this really simple : marriage is n't for you , ' @entity1 's father had said at the time			1
' you do n't marry to make yourself happy , you marry to make someone else happy			0
' so @entity1 turned to the @entity61 to share his experience			2
' i realized that i had lost sight of what marriage was really about and was losing @entity0 in the process , ' @entity1 admitted			1
' as well as her hopes and dreams			0
' ' i could react in anger and our relationship would get worse , or i could try and see past my own hurts and my own frustrations ' under the loaded title , ' marriage is not for you , ' @entity1 wrote on his blog : ' having been married only a year and a half , i 've recently come to the conclusion that marriage is n't for me			1
' @entity1 , a @entity79 , met his wife @entity0 when they were just 15 years old			1
they were friends for ten years before their relationship became something more , and a year - and - a - half ago , they got married			1
' the nearer @entity0 and i approached the decision to marry , the more i was filled with a paralyzing fear			2
was i ready ? was i making the right choice ? was @entity0 the right person to marry ? would she make me happy ? ' he wrote			1
but a conversation with his father put rest to any doubts @entity1 had about his upcoming nuptials			2
' @entity1 , you ’re being totally selfish			2
so i ’m going to make this really simple : marriage is n’t for you			0
you do n’t marry to make yourself happy , you marry to make someone else happy , ' @entity1 's father told him			1
' more than that , your marriage is n’t for yourself , you ’re marrying for a family			2
not just for the in - laws and all of that nonsense , but for your future children			0
who do you want to help you raise them ? who do you want to influence them ? marriage is n’t for you			0
it ’s not about you			0
marriage is about the person you married , ' he said			2
@entity1 , adding his own commentary to his father 's advice , concluded : ' no , a true marriage ( and true love ) is never about you			1
it 's about the person you love - their wants , their needs , their hopes , and their dreams			2
selfishness demands , " what 's in it for me ? " while @entity130 asks , " what can i give ? " ' initially , the blogger , who also edits a site called @entity134 , received criticism from some readers who feared he was forsaking his needs to tend to someone else , but he insists that misses the point			0
@entity0 admitted she was touched by the post - and surprised when it went viral , with thousands of people commenting on her marriage			1
one commenter wrote , ' loved it ! after 15 years of marriage , and several near misses with that grey line in the affair department , my husband finally figured that out ... i finally was ready to walk away ... he would now tell you he was so wrong and not thinking about that other ‘ person ’ he should have been taking care of – our marriage			1
' @entity0 admitted she was touched by the post - and surprised when it went viral , with thousands of people commenting on her marriage @entity1 , adding his own commentary to his father 's advice , concluded : ' no , a true marriage ( and true love ) is never about you			1
it 's about the person you love - their wants , their needs , their hopes , and their dreams another tweeted , ' thanks for posting that " marriage is n't for you " article it changed my mind on that archaic , disenfranchising , and oppressive tradition ! ' it 's also received backlash from cynics for what they called , an overly simplistic view of marriage			1
' one of the most overrated institutions on the planet			0
only makes sense if you do n't have a will , ' wrote a commentator on @entity194			0
' marriage is n't for men , with the divorce laws , child support and alimony what man wants to get married , ' said another			2
' and marriage is n't for women either , because in most cases you just end up being a nanny , nurse , housekeeper , second income , etc , ' came the retort			0
' sounds like a nice sentiment			0
could not help but thinking though that it would have a lot more credibility if the author had made it past the 2 year mark first ... it can be a lot more difficult than you ever expected despite good intentions and a lot of hard work			0
people can be unpredictable over the long haul , ' wrote another			0
@entity225 responded with an article entitled , ' stop lying , marriage is for you , ' which argued that marrying someone you love because it will make your life better is n't a bad thing .			0

@entity1 @entity1 wrote a blog post entitled , ' marriage is not for you '
his open sentence states that he has been married for a year and a half and had come to the conclusion marriage is not for him
@entity1 then *explains* he means marriage is not about him - it 's about his wife , @entity0 , and their family
@entity0 supports her husband 's view of marriage in the post , but admits she took the *controversial* title the wrong way at first
