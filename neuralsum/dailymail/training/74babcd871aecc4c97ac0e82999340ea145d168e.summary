' despite the negative attention @entity14 received throughout last year for her role in the administration 's failure to prevent the deaths and it 's subsequent botched response to the attack , @entity14 's favorability ratings outpace those of her main 2016 rivals			1
@entity5 gets favorable marks from @entity17 despite her association with the @entity3 terrorist attacks just over a year ago , @entity14 resigned from her cabinet - level position amidst congressional hearings into @entity3			1
as if the physical attack on @entity3 was n't bad enough , @entity14 floundered in the face of @entity40 , shouting out the now infamous line ' what difference at this point does it make ' when pressed about the cause of the attack			1
' the fact is we had four dead @entity17 ! was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they â€™d go kill some @entity17 ? what difference at this point does it make ? ' @entity14 said while testifying at a @entity58 hearing on january 23 , 2013			2

' the hard questions are not , " do you want to be president ? " " can you win ? " ' @entity14 said during a recent speech			0

on thursday , @entity111 rep. @entity110 told a blogger for @entity113 that a group of nine @entity108 , including himself , have been reviewing congressional testimony on the attacks from various witnesses to look for ' any contradictions in testimonies			0
' while not expressly named by @entity122 , @entity14 's testimony is undoubtedly on the group 's list to review			2
' @entity3 happened on her watch , so she will always have a connection to the attack , ' a former spokesperson for @entity14 at state , told the @entity130 last week			1
' there have been some efforts to make it about her , which i suspect will continue despite the lack of evidence			0
' in @entity1 's poll , a majority of respondents said they thought @entity40 should continue investigatating the @entity73 administration 's roll in the @entity3 terrorist attack , and 61 percent said they still believe the @entity73 administration is engaged in a cover - up			1

' now , only 60 percent say the same thing			0

in a potential match up against @entity163 governor @entity162 and former @entity165 governor @entity164 , two politicians who ranked highest on @entity169 respondents ' 2016 wish list , @entity14 would beat both by a solid eight to nine points , the poll found			1
