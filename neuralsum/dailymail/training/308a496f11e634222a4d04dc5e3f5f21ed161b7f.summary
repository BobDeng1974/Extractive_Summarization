by @entity0 published : 01:02 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 03:50 est , 15 july 2013 @entity4 has highly sensitive documents on how the @entity3 is structured and operates that could harm the @entity8 government , but has insisted that they not be made public , a journalist close to the @entity3 leaker said			1
@entity9 , a columnist with @entity11 newspaper who first reported on the intelligence leaks , told @entity0 that disclosure of the information in the documents ' would allow somebody who read them to know exactly how the @entity3 does what it does , which would in turn allow them to evade that surveillance or replicate it			1
' he said the ' literally thousands of documents ' taken by @entity4 constitute ' basically the instruction manual for how the @entity3 is built			1
' during friday 's meeting @entity4 told human rights activists he plans to stay in @entity27 temporarily , but officials say they have n't received any request ' in order to take documents with him that proved that what he was saying was true he had to take ones that included very sensitive , detailed blueprints of how the @entity3 does what they do , ' the journalist said sunday in a @entity41 hotel room			1
he said the interview was taking place about four hours after his last interaction with @entity4			2
@entity9 said he believes the disclosure of the information in the documents would not prove harmful to @entity8 or their national security , but that @entity4 has insisted they not be made public			1
media frenzy : @entity27 lawyer @entity49 ( c ) speaks to journalists after arriving at @entity51 in @entity52 on friday for a meeting with @entity3 whistleblower @entity4 ' i think it would be harmful to the @entity8 government , as they perceive their own interests , if the details of those programs were revealed , ' he said			1
he has previously said the documents have been encrypted to help ensure their safekeeping			0
@entity4 emerged from weeks of hiding in a @entity52 airport friday , and said he was willing to meet president @entity65 's condition that he stop leaking @entity8 secrets if it means @entity27 would give him asylum until he can move on to @entity69			1
@entity9 told the @entity0 that he deliberately avoids talking to @entity4 about issues related to where the former analyst might seek asylum in order to avoid possible legal problems for himself guarded : the world 's media were eager to get a glimpse of the fugitive whistleblower who remains at the police guarded transit area of the airport , where the meeting took place @entity4 is believed to be stuck in the transit area of @entity52 's main international airport , where he arrived from @entity86 on june 23			1
he 's had offers of asylum from @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , but because his @entity8 passport has been revoked , the logistics of reaching whichever country he chooses are complicated			2
still , @entity9 said that @entity4 remains ' calm and tranquil , ' despite his predicament			2
' i have n't sensed an iota of remorse or regret or anxiety over the situation that he 's in , ' said @entity9 , who has lived in @entity102 for the past eight years			0
' he 's of course tense and focused on his security and his short - term well - being to the best extent that he can , but he 's very resigned to the fact that things might go terribly wrong and he 's at peace with that			0
' @entity9 said he worried that interest in @entity4 's personal saga had detracted from the impact of his revelations , adding that @entity4 deliberately turned down nearly all requests for interviews to avoid the media spotlight			2
asked whether @entity4 seemed worried about his personal safety , @entity9 responded , ' he 's concerned			0
' stranded : mr @entity4 arrived at @entity51 on june 23 and has remained in the transit lounge ever since he said the @entity8 has shown it 's ' willing to take even the most extreme steps if they think doing so is necessary to neutralize a national security threat , ' @entity9 said			1
' he 's aware of all those things , he 's concerned about them but he 's not going to be in any way paralyzed or constrained in what he thinks he can do as a result of that			0
' asked about a so - called dead man 's pact , which @entity9 has said would allow several people to access @entity4 's trove of documents were anything to happen to him , @entity9 replied that ' media descriptions of it have been overly simplistic			2
' it 's not just a matter of , if he dies , things get released , it 's more nuanced than that , ' he said			0
' it 's really just a way to protect himself against extremely rogue behavior on the part of the @entity8 , by which i mean violent actions toward him , designed to end his life , and it 's just a way to ensure that nobody feels incentivized to do that			0
' he declined to provide any more details about the pact or how it would work			0
@entity9 said he himself has beefed up his own security , particularly since a laptop went missing from his @entity41 home			0
attack : @entity8 deputy secretary of state @entity161 ( left ) criticised @entity162 for failing to extradite mr @entity4 when he was in @entity86 following two days of high - level talks between the @entity8 and @entity162 on security and the economy ' i do n't really feel comfortable discussing the specific measures , but one would be really irrational and foolish to have thousands of top - secret documents from the most secretive agency of the world 's most powerful government and not be thoughtful about added security , ' said the 46 - year - old former constitutional and civil rights lawyer who has written three books contending the government has violated personal rights in the name of protecting national security			1
@entity9 has also co-authored a series of articles in @entity41 's @entity182 newspaper focusing on @entity3 actions in @entity69			0
he said he expected to continue publishing further stories based on other @entity4 documents over the next four months			2
upcoming stories would likely include details on ' other domestic spying programs that have yet to be revealed , ' but which are similar in scope to those he has been reporting on			0
he did not provide further details on the nature of those programs			0
it was not immediately clear whether @entity27 would take @entity4 up on his latest request for asylum , which could further test @entity8 - @entity27 relations			1
following friday 's meeting between @entity4 and human rights activists , @entity8 officials criticized @entity27 for allowing a ' propaganda platform ' for the @entity3 leader			1
@entity204 spokesman @entity203 said @entity27 should instead send @entity4 back to the @entity8 to face the felony charges that are pending against him			2
@entity203 said @entity4 is not a human rights activist or a dissident			0
' he is accused of leaking classified information , has been charged with three felony counts and should be returned to the @entity8 , ' the spokesman said			0
the escape route is fraught with problems for @entity4 , and would mean him having to gain access to @entity27 and then taking a huge detour an air plane , a supposed @entity216 flight to @entity217 , rolls out in preparation for a take - off seen through a window of @entity51 outside @entity52 , @entity27			1
