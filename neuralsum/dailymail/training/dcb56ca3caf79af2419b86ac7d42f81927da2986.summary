by @entity0 published : 12:44 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 01:43 est , 7 june 2013 one of @entity2 's stranger ideas has led to the identification of a new planet twice as heavy as @entity5 , orbiting a star some 2,000 light - years from @entity7			1
‘ this is the first time that this aspect of @entity2 's theory of relativity has been used to discover a planet , ’ said @entity8 , of @entity9			1
the discovery made use of the beaming effect which occurs when light from the parent star brightens as its planet tugs closer to @entity7 , and dims as the planet pulls it away			2
@entity2 's planet , formally known as @entity24 , is a ' hot @entity5 ' that orbits its star every 1.5 days			1
the planet is tidally locked to its star , always showing the same face to it , just as the @entity29 is tidally locked to @entity7 the warping of space - time caused by this motion forces light particles into a narrower , more focused beam that looks brighter than it really is			2
the newfound world , nicknamed ‘ @entity2 ’s planet ’ , orbits its star every 1.5 days			1
it is located about 2,000 light - years from @entity7 in the constellation @entity40			0
the discovery made use of @entity2 's relativistic ' beaming effect ' which occurs when light from the parent star brightens as its planet tugs closer to @entity7 , and dims as the planet pulls it away formally known as kepler - 76b , the planet is tidally locked to its star , always showing the same face to it , just as the @entity29 is tidally locked to @entity7			1
as a result , @entity2 ’s planet broils at a temperature of about 3,600 degrees @entity54			1
the team found strong evidence that the planet has extremely fast jet - stream winds that carry the heat around it			2
this is the first time optical observations have shown evidence of alien jet stream winds at work			2
detection of planets via the beaming effect was predicted in 2003 by professor @entity69 at @entity70 and professor @entity71 , now at @entity72			0
back then , the idea was met with @entity74 , a @entity70 astronomer who collaborated on the discovery , originally doubted it was even possible to do			0
‘ i thought it was silly , ’ he told @entity77			0
‘ i thought the effect was so small we ’d never detect it			0
’ the technique requires measurements of changes in brightness as small as a few parts per million , which could not be achieved a decade ago			0
but since the @entity90 ’s @entity89 spacecraft went into orbit in 2009 , the researchers had the extremely detailed observations necessary to put theory into practice			1
the diameter of @entity2 's planet is about 25 per cent larger than @entity5 and it weighs twice as much			1
it orbits a type f star located about 2,000 light - years from @entity7 in the constellation @entity40 alongside @entity2 ’s beaming effect , the team looked for signs that the star was stretched into a american football shape by gravitational tides from the orbiting planet			1
the star would appear brighter when observed the football from the side , due to more visible surface area , and fainter when viewed end - on			0
the third small effect was due to starlight reflected by the planet itself			2
‘ we have been searching for this elusive effect for more than two years , and we finally found a planet			2
it is amazing that already a decade ago @entity69 and @entity71 foresaw this happening , ’ said @entity8			0
@entity2 's planet , formally known as @entity24 , is a ‘ hot @entity5 ’ that orbits its star every 1.5 days			1
the planet is tidally locked to its star , always showing the same face to it , just as the @entity29 is tidally locked to @entity7			0
as a result , @entity24 broils at a temperature of about 3,600 degrees @entity54			0
its diameter is about 25 per cent larger than @entity5 and it weighs twice as much			1
it orbits a type f star located about 2,000 light - years from @entity7 in the constellation @entity40			0
the hottest point on @entity24 is n't the sub stellar point ( or high noon ) but a location offset by about 10,000 miles .			0

@entity2 's theory of relativity used for the first time to identify a planet
@entity143 made using detailed data from @entity90 ’s @entity89 spacecraft
@entity147 has a diameter 25 *%* larger than @entity5 and weighs twice as much
