the most exciting thing about @entity1 is that he can hit 360 degrees — he can play almost any shot , anywhere			1
that ’s not to say we should be expecting him to open his box of tricks in a test match			2
it would be completely unfair to burden him with that			0
but from what we ’ve seen of him so far in limited - overs cricket for @entity16 , the boy has got some serious talent			1
nice move : @entity1 and @entity16 warm up with a game of touch rugby at @entity21 on thursday his hand - eye coordination and bat speed are exceptional — a bit like @entity25 ’s			1
he has strong wrists , which may help explain his prowess at squash , and obviously a good deal of self - confidence			1
it ’s a combination that can make him very hard to bowl to			0
we saw during his fantastic 121 off 74 balls in that one - dayer against @entity35 at @entity36 in may that , by the end , they did n’t know where to bowl			1
he was just smashing them over extra cover for six			0
of course , test cricket is a different beast			0
there are slips and a gully in pretty well all the time , and the edges that might fly to third man in a one - day game can end up in a fielder ’s hands in a test match			1
there are times when i ’ve watched him play red - ball cricket that he has gone hard at the ball early on and that can lead to nicks			1
so he ’ll need time to adjust — just as he will behind the stumps			0
you still need a technique to survive in test cricket			0
players such as @entity68 and @entity66 had exactly that and we saw at @entity36 with @entity71 that a keeper - batsman can struggle with lateral movement if his technique is n’t quite up to scratch			1
but the natural talent is clearly there			0
he plays the ramp shot differently from @entity79 with his @entity80			0
@entity79 goes down early and hits the ball back over his head , with the blade of the bat facing him			1
@entity1 stands up , shimmies across his stumps — but not so far that he ’s exposing them too much — and watches the ball			1
he does n’t try to overhit and keeps his head in line with the ball			0
he has a strong bottom hand and almost rubbery wrists , and has the confidence to go through with the stroke			2
the result can be that bowlers then go wide outside off to stop him playing the ramp , but then he responds with a kind of reverse - scoop or swat over backward point			2
if the bowlers go full , he sets himself early and gets his front leg out of the way			0
because his hands are so quick , he can latch on to anything that is n’t quite yorker length and has the leverage to hit it over the top			0
there was a one - dayer against @entity110 at @entity111 in 2012 when they had set the field to stop him playing the ramp so instead he just stood up and hit everything in the @entity116 he absolutely destroyed them			2
the question is whether he can transfer this mindset into @entity120 , though of course all these exciting shots are mainly for the one - day game			2
people have to realise he could take a while to adapt to the longer form , just as it took a while for @entity1 to convince everyone he could do a job for @entity16 in limited - overs cricket			1
but , with the @entity132 game at such a low ebb right now , he is definitely worth getting excited about .			0
