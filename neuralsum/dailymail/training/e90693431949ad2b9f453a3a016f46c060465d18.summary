by @entity0 and @entity1 a possible fifth ' ping ' from the black box of missing @entity6 has been detected by a surveillance plane conducting an acoustic search , @entity3 officials said			1
the latest signal was picked up by an @entity3 p - 3 orion aircraft , with on - board instruments tracing it to the same area where two pings were heard this week by @entity3 ship @entity15			1
air chief marshal @entity16 , who is co-ordinating the search in @entity18 , said on thursday : ' the acoustic data will require further analysis overnight but shows potential of being from a man - made source			1
he said the detection , on tuesday afternoon , was held for about five minutes and 32 seconds , while the second was held for about seven minutes			2
' yesterday 's [ tuesday 's ] signals will assist in better defining a reduced and much more manageable search area on the ocean floor ' he said			1
despite what mr @entity16 described as ' further encouraging findings ' he said that the underwater vehicle ' @entity53 21 ' , which can ' sniff out ' objects deep in the ocean , would not be launched until the search area could be narrowed			2
' i believe we are searching in the right area , but we need to visually identify aircraft wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of @entity6 , ' he said			1
' i 'm not prepared to confirm anything until such time as somebody lays eyes on the wreckage			0
' more signals : a handout image released by the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) shows the search area in the @entity28 , @entity71 of @entity3 , where 15 planes and 14 ships are scouring a 75,423 square km area of ocean for the wreckage of flight mh370 more than a month after it disappeared a map from @entity69 shows where pinger contacts have been recorded in the search for flight mh370 however , @entity83 captain @entity82 said the detections indicate the device emitting the pings is somewhere within about a 12 - mile radius			1
that would still equate to a 500 square mile chunk of the ocean floor - an area that would take the @entity93 sub between six weeks to two months to canvas			1
data analysis of the first two detections at the weekend has shown they were consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder , said the air chief marshal			0
the @entity3 @entity102 based at @entity103 in @entity104 , on the @entity106 coast south of @entity107 , concluded that the two detections were from a source that was not of ' natural origin ' and was ' likely sourced ' from specific electronic equipment			1
mr @entity16 , pointing out that his optimism had risen since sunday , warned that a lot of silt could complicate the search , which is being boosted by a sonar buoy and a modified @entity118 aircraft to co-ordinate with @entity15			2
' it 's important for @entity15 to collect as much data as possible ahead of deploying @entity53 21 , ' he said			0
' the reason we want to do that is there 's no second chances			0
' the pings detected by the @entity3 defence vessel @entity15 's pinger locator in the search for the missing flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder in the southern @entity28 may now not be released the towed pinger locator ( @entity133 - 25 ) on the deck of the @entity135 detected two signals which were thought to be from a black box transponder , but further analysis has shown the signals may have no connection with @entity6 the @entity93 21 submarine drone , which will be used to scour the seabed for @entity6 once the search area in narrowed down further , is hosited on board the @entity135 after buoyanct testing he warned that the recently - detected signals have been much weaker than the original signals detected - ' so that means probably we 're either a long way from it , or in my view , more likely , the batteries are starting to fade and as a consequence the signal is becoming weaker			1
' he added : ' so we need to , as we say in @entity3 , make hay while the sun shines			1
' @entity15 , he said , would be looking to pick up more transmissions that would help to better pinpoint where the signal was coming from			2
once the search area has been narrowed , ships and aircraft could then find something in ' a matter of days , ' he suggested			2
he continued to express optimism that searchers were closing in on the plane 's final resting place , despite what he believed were signals from dying batteries			0
@entity93 21 , takes six times longer to cover the same area as the pinger locator , which is pulled behind the boat at a depth of 3,000 metres			0
a @entity118 @entity181 is seen parked on the tarmac after returning from a search mission for debris from missing @entity6 yesterday @entity186 confidence of @entity188 commodore @entity187 ( pictured , right , with search chief @entity16 last month ) of the recorded pings being from missing @entity6 has now waned the sub 's sonar can scan only about 100 metres and it can ' see ' with lights and cameras only a few metres			0
the maximum depth it can dive is 4,500 metres , and some areas of the search zone are deeper			0
search crews are also contending with a thick layer of silt on the sea floor that can both hide any possible wreckage and distort the sounds emanating from the black boxes that may be resting there , said mr @entity187 , who is helping to lead the search			0
captain @entity82 said : ' it 's certainly a man - made device emitting that signal and i have no explanation for what other component could be there			1
' i 'm an engineer so i do n't talk emotions too much			0
but certainly when i received word that they had another detection , you feel elated			0
' you 're hopeful that you can locate the final resting place of the aircraft and bring closure to all the families involved			0

latest signal picked up in area where other pings have been heard
it was detected by an @entity3 p - 3 orion surveillance aircraft
' shows potential of being from man - made source ' - @entity3 official
possible black box signals heard for several minutes earlier this week
