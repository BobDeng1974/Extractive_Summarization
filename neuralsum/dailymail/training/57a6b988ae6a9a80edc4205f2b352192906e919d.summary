a 16 - year - old stowaway has miraculously survived flying halfway across the @entity1 in the wheel well of a flight from @entity4 to @entity5 - despite temperatures of @entity7 at 38,000 feet			1
the teen was discovered on the tarmac at the @entity11 airport on sunday carrying no @entity12 or belongings - apart from a comb - and told the @entity14 he had run away from home after an argument with his parents			1
' kid 's lucky to be alive , ' @entity14 spokesman @entity18 in @entity19 said on sunday night			2
among those skeptical about his journey , medical experts said his body would have had to fall into a hibernation - like state - with his heart beating only a couple of times a minute - for him to survive			1
@entity18 said when the flight landed in @entity11 , the boy remained unconscious for about an hour , but eventually hopped down from the wheel well and started wandering around the airport grounds			1
' he was unconscious for the lion 's share of the flight , ' @entity18 said			2
the flight lasted about 5 1/2 hours			2
@entity44 spokesman @entity52 said airline personnel noticed the boy on the ramp after the flight arrived and immediately notified airport security			1
a picture of the teen being taken away for medical care , looking awake and alert , was provided to the @entity62 by @entity63			2
plane : this is a 767 - 300 aircraft - the same model that the teen boy managed to stow himself away in staggering : the 16 - year - old somehow survived unharmed while stowed in the wheel well the boy was not charged with any crime and has been handed over to child protective services			1
' our primary concern now is for the well - being of the boy , who is exceptionally lucky to have survived , ' @entity52 said			1
@entity18 said the boy was medically screened and found to be unharmed			1
the sheer physical stresses on the body any stowaway climbing inside the landing gear faces are incredible			0
according to the @entity85 's @entity84 , the chances of survival of a wheel - well stowaway on a commercial aircraft are around 24 per cent			2
avoiding being crushed when the undercarriage retracts is the first challenge faced and then in quick succession , hypothermia , hypoxia and ultimately falling when the doors reopen			0
obviously the landing gear well has no heat or oxygen supply and is not pressurized			0
at 18,000 feet , the oxygen supply becomes so depleted that the stowaway is likely to lose consciousness			2
anywhere above 33,000 feet , the stowaway 's lungs would be in need of artificial pressure to be able to expand and contract normally			0
@entity103 is 29,029ft and only 5 per cent of the 3,000 + who have made that ascent have done so without oxygen at 38,000 feet , the temperature would be no more than -81f , which usually would prove fatal within minutes			0
and as the plane comes into land , assuming the stowaway is even conscious , they would have to avoid being crushed again or falling thousands of feet to their death			0
' does n't even remember the flight , ' @entity18 said			1
' it 's amazing he survived that			2
' but news of the survival was met with suspicion , as most wheel - well stowaways do n't survive the freezing temperatures and lack of oxygen			1
among the skeptics was @entity126 aviation consultant @entity125 , who said : ' this is a first in medical science and a first in physiology			0
i just do n't believe it			2
' dr. @entity133 , @entity126 ' chief health and medical editor , said to survive such conditions , the body has to fall into a hibernation - like state , with the heart only beating a couple of times a minute			1
' it 's near impossible , almost miraculous , and maybe there 's more to the story , ' @entity133 said			0
another aviation expert , @entity144 , said that he was staggered the boy survived			1
' the odds of a person surviving that long of a flight at that altitude are very remote , actually			1
i mean , you are talking about altitudes that are well above the altitude of @entity154			2
and temperatures that can reach 40 degrees below zero , ' @entity144 said			2
' a lot of people would only have useful consciousness for a minute or two at that altitude			1
' for somebody to survive multiple hours with that lack of oxygen and that cold is just miraculous			2
i 've never heard of anything like that before			0
' his misadventure also raised security questions			0
a congressman who serves on the @entity171 wondered how the teen could have got onto the airfield at @entity34 unnoticed			1
' i have long been concerned about security at our airport perimeters			0
# stowaway teen demonstrates vulnerabilities that need to be addressed , ' tweeted rep. @entity179 , a @entity180 who represents the @entity182 's eastern cities and suburbs			0
a call and email message to a @entity187 spokeswoman were not immediately returned			0
officials at @entity36 referred questions to the @entity190 , which did not return a phone call seeking comment			0
take - off : the 16 - year - old boy sneaked onto the plane at @entity34 airport in @entity4 ( pictured ) @entity44 24 to @entity196 , @entity4 , was delayed nearly three hours sunday due to the incident			1
the flight was scheduled to leave @entity36 at noon and finally departed at 2:51 p.m. a male passenger who declined to be identified said that he was seated on the plane to @entity196 with his family before he was notified of the delay			0
he said that flight attendants were told to disarm the doors and that the flight would be delayed 10 to 15 minutes			0
a @entity207 spokesman who declined to be named referred questions to the @entity14 and airport authorities			0
in august , a 13 - or 14 - year - old boy in @entity211 survived a 35 - minute trip in the wheel well of a domestic flight after stowing away			1
authorities credited the flight 's short duration and altitude of about 25,000			1
others stowing away in wheel wells have died , including a 16 - year - old killed after stowing away aboard a flight from @entity223 , @entity224 , to @entity225 in 2010 and a 26 - year - old man who fell onto a suburban @entity228 street from a flight from @entity230 in 2012			1
september 2012 : a 26 - year - old @entity232 national flying from @entity230 to @entity233 in @entity228 was found dead in a suburban street under the flight path after presumably falling to his death as the undercarriage opened			1
august 2012 : another man was found dead in the landing gear bay of a boring 747 when it landed at @entity233 from a flight from @entity243 , @entity244			0
june 2010 : a 20 - year - old @entity246 man survived -41f temperatures for 100 minutes during a flight from @entity249 to @entity233			1
he survived because the plane stayed at 25,000 feet due to thunderstorms			0
2006 : @entity252 flew from @entity253 to @entity254 and his core body temperature was 79 degrees fahrenheit when he arrived at the @entity256 for treatment of hypothermia and dehydration			0
anything below 85 degrees @entity261 is usually fatal			0
december 2002 : @entity263 refugee @entity262 flew four hours from @entity264 to @entity265 in a @entity266 in temperatures below -41f			1
he survived due to a leaky pipe which shot out warm air and also gave him something to hold onto when the plane landed .			0

teenage boy flew from @entity34 , @entity4 to @entity11 , @entity5 on sunday
the *unidentified* teen was discovered ' dazed and *confused* ' on the runway
crept onto @entity280 and *braved* temperatures of @entity7 ( -62c ) during the five - and - a - half hour flight
lost consciousness during the flight but survived unharmed
he wo n't face charges and has been handed to child protective services
he is believed to be only the second person to survive at such an altitude
