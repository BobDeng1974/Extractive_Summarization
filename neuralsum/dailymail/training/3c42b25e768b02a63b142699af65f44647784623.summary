the @entity1 administration said wednesday it is withholding from @entity2 some sensitive details of its nuclear negotiations with @entity5 because it is worried that @entity2 government officials have leaked information to try to scuttle the talks — and will continue to do so			1
in extraordinary admissions that reflect increasingly strained ties between the @entity13 and @entity2 , the @entity9 and @entity10 said they were not sharing everything from the negotiations with the @entity2 and complained that @entity2 officials had misrepresented what they had been told in the past			1
meanwhile , senior @entity13 officials privately blamed prime minister @entity20 himself for ' changing the dynamic ' of previously robust information - sharing by politicizing it			0
the comments came as a late march deadline to forge the outline of an @entity5 nuclear deal looms			2
tension : @entity2 prime minister @entity20			0
is the @entity13 heading for a good or bad nuclear deal with @entity5 ? good , says @entity32			1
bad , says @entity2 prime minister @entity20 @entity20 has angered the @entity9 by his open opposition to a deal he believes threatens @entity2 's existence , and by accepting a @entity37 invitation to address @entity38 about @entity5 in early march without consulting the @entity9 , a breach of diplomatic protocol			1
@entity9 press secretary @entity41 told reporters that sharing all details of the negotiations with governments that are not at the table would complicate efforts to get a deal that would prevent @entity5 from developing a nuclear weapon in exchange for sanctions relief			2
the talks are being held among the five permanent members of the @entity54 — @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and the @entity13 — @entity59 and @entity5			2
' the @entity13 is not going to be in a position of negotiating this agreement in public , particularly when we see that there is a continued practice of cherry - picking specific pieces of information and using them out of context to distort the negotiating position of the @entity13 , ' @entity41 said , when asked whether the @entity13 was limiting the amount of information it shared with @entity2 about the talks			2
not happy : the tensions between the @entity13 and @entity2 over negotiating with @entity75 plunged to a new low when mr. @entity20 engineered an invitation to address a joint meeting of @entity38 , in less than two weeks , to warn against a ' bad deal			2
' ' so , there is an obligation when you 're participating in these kinds of negotiations to ensure that those consultations and that those negotiations are carried out in good faith			0
and that means giving negotiators the room and the space to negotiate , ' he said			0
@entity10 spokeswoman @entity93 went further , confirming that one of the steps the administration takes to ensure that ' classified negotiating details stay behind closed doors ' is to withhold them from @entity2			1
she also directly blamed @entity2 for mischaracterizing the talks			0
' i think it 's safe to say that not everything you 're hearing from the @entity2 government is an accurate reflection of the details of the talks , ' she said			1
' there 's a selective sharing of information			0
' but while @entity41 and @entity93 said the limitations on information sharing were longstanding , @entity13 officials more directly involved in the talks said the decision to withhold the most sensitive details of the negotiations dated back only several weeks			1
those officials , speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly , said the administration believes @entity20 , who is facing a march 17 election at home , has made a political decision to try to destroy the negotiations rather than merely insist on a good deal			0
this , they said , had led to politically motivated leaks from @entity2 officials and made it impossible to continue to share all details of the talks , particularly as @entity20 has not backed down on his vow to argue against a nuclear deal when he speaks to @entity38			1
deal maker ? @entity5 president @entity136			0
@entity2 says any pact that stops short of totally dismembering @entity5 programs with weapons - making potential is deeply flawed neither @entity41 nor @entity93 would discuss the details of the leaks but senior @entity13 officials have expressed consternation with reports in the @entity2 media as well as by @entity147 about the number of centrifuges @entity5 might be able to keep under a potential agreement			1
centrifuges are used to enrich uranium and diplomats familiar with the talks have said @entity5 may be allowed to keep more of them in exchange for other concessions under current proposals that are on the table			0
@entity20 has insisted that @entity5 , whose top officials have sworn to obliterate @entity2 , should not be allowed to enrich any uranium			1
the @entity13 and its partners say that stance is untenable because @entity5 would never accept it			0
as the talks have progressed , @entity20 's opposition to an agreement has increased over what he believes to be extreme concessions made to @entity5 that would leave it as a threshold nuclear weapons power and a direct threat to @entity2 's existence			1
the @entity9 and @entity10 maintained that the @entity13 will not leave @entity2 threatened			2
they also insisted that @entity2 has not been completely cut out of the loop and that overall security cooperation with the jewish state remains strong			0
administration officials and some lawmakers have said they will not attend the speech .			0

@entity10 spokeswoman @entity93 says ' not everything you 're hearing from the @entity2 government is an accurate *depiction* of the talks '
@entity2 officials *responded* arguing that if the deal being negotiated was a good one , why was there a need to hide details ?
@entity32 's *acknowledgment* of a gap in its *briefings* to @entity2 *highlights* growing space between the allies on the *emerging* agreement with @entity5
