a new book @entity1 has revealed how the former @entity3 leader @entity2 recommended @entity1 for a knighthood for far longer than should have been possible , the @entity5 has passed itself off as the home of political virtue : more honest and less corrupt than what its leader @entity8 at the last election referred to dismissively as ‘ the two old parties ’			1
that veil of purity has been stripped away by the exigencies of power			1
for those on the @entity20 who voted @entity3 at the last election because of its pledge to scrap student fees , the party ’s decision in government to support their tripling to £ 9,000 has destroyed its reputation for integrity			1
those on the @entity28 who felt the party could be trusted to keep their word as partner with the @entity32 say ‘ never again ’ , following @entity8 ’s abrupt abrogation of the @entity35 agreement to support a @entity36 for the creation of fewer and more equal - sized constituencies			1
so much for the @entity3 ’ commitment to a ‘ fairer electoral system ’			1
those of no particular political leaning , who simply admired the @entity3 ’ critique of the way the ‘ old parties ’ handed out @entity46 seats to their financial backers , have seen how @entity50 have done exactly the same : the latest batch of @entity3 nominated peerages for donors includes a faintly sinister nightclub owner			1
now one of the party ’s previous nominations for honours has come back to haunt it			1
in its serialisation of @entity62 : the double life of @entity1 , the @entity64 has revealed how the former @entity3 leader @entity2 recommended @entity1 for a knighthood , despite knowing of the sordid stories about the way the former @entity69 @entity3 mp had sexually abused a number of boys , some from a children ’s home he had co-founded			1
the book , co-written by @entity76 , @entity1 ’s successor as mp for @entity69 , gives horrifying accounts of how this 29st man , the single most recognisable figure in his party , sadistically forced himself on some of his most vulnerable constituents			1
it also contains compelling evidence of how @entity69 ’s mr @entity85 — in every sense — was protected by senior figures in politics and the criminal justice system , to the disgust of local police officers who believed they had enough witness statements to bring a cast - iron case of serial sexual abuse			1
back in 1979 , @entity106 published details of witness statements of @entity1 ’s abuse on its main news page			1
by no means are all stories in that periodical true in every particular — and it has the libel bills to show for that — but the striking thing about this one was that @entity1 neither publicly denied the accusations nor sued the magazine			1
@entity76 ’s conclusion is that the @entity5 ( later @entity3 ) leadership turned a blind eye to the whole story because @entity1 was too central a figure in the party and an irreplaceable element in its attempt to appeal to working - class voters especially in the @entity129 , where it had found it hard to make an electoral breakthrough			1
on saturday , a spokesman for the @entity3 leader told the @entity64 : ¿ clearly he would never have paid tribute to @entity1 if he ¿ d had any idea about these horrible allegations ' indeed , @entity1 , a former mayor of @entity69 , was the prototype of what the party later made its modus operandi : a ferocious concentration on a select band of constituencies where every street would be intensively wooed with all manner of promises of a purely local nature			2
it was a @entity151 version of what in @entity152 is called pork barrel politics ; and it has the same risks			1
it is clear that one reason why @entity1 was so protected was that he had a pudgy finger in every local pie : he had done countless favours — and they could be called in			1
coincidentally , the man who masterminded this localised brand of electioneering for the @entity3 , @entity161 , faces accusations of sexual harassment of party workers — though of an infinitely less serious nature			1
@entity8 has already admitted the party had been far too slow to investigate the complaints against @entity161			2
but that is as nothing to the embarrassment he now faces : reminded of how , in 2008 , he sent a message to be read out at @entity1 ’s 80th birthday party , declaring : ‘ you were a beacon for our party in the @entity179 and @entity180 and continue to be an inspiration to the people of @entity69			2
’ on saturday , a spokesman for the @entity3 leader told the @entity64 : ‘ clearly he would never have paid tribute to @entity1 if he ’d had any idea about these horrible allegations			2
’ how can that be true ? as noted above , the allegations had been known since at least 1979			2
all that can be said is that @entity8 ( and , indeed , @entity95 ) found it convenient to disregard or forget them			2
obviously , it is not the case that every unpleasant person is automatically guilty of anything levelled against them			2
yet even leaving aside the allegations of sexual abuse , @entity1 was a byword in the party for egomania , bullying and bluster , cordially loathed by the leadership			2
he was , though , a formidable vote - winner : and for them , that is what counted			2
like @entity1 himself , they just kept smiling			2
now , however , the party ’s leadership has very little to smile about			0
the latest opinion polls have their public support at a derisory 7 per cent			0
they face annihilation in the imminent elections to the @entity217			0
given that almost the sole intact principle of the @entity3 is their belief in ever greater harmonisation of @entity151 within the @entity222 , this would represent a special humiliation			0
@entity1 at the @entity224 in 1990 ( left ) and deputy prime minister @entity8 ( right ) it is too early to say they face similar extinction in the @entity228 , scheduled for june 2015			0
but if that were to happen , most of their leading figures could easily find accommodation in one or other of the ‘ two old parties ’			1
of the @entity35 ministers , business secretary @entity235 used to be a @entity238 member and would have no trouble being a colleague of @entity241 ; education minister @entity242 would fit snugly into the @entity32 ( as @entity243 regularly tells him )			0
besides which , the @entity3 ’ financial solvency is hardly guaranteed , especially if @entity1 ’s victims are successful in suing the party for compensation			0
the truth is that if it were a business , this unhappy merger between the @entity5 and social democratic parties would be wound up and its assets ( such as they are ) distributed among other interested parties			0
if such an outcome could in any way be attributed to @entity1 ’s misdeeds , then some good would have come out of his depravity			0
anger : lord @entity261 opposes the use of pesticides on crops @entity261 , a lobbyist for organic food growers , last week had a letter published in the @entity64 , insisting : ‘ the claim that the @entity268 is telling consumers to buy organic food “ to avoid getting cancer ” is untrue			0
’ he was responding to this column , which noted @entity274 ’s announcement that in a large study of middle - aged women in the @entity151 ‘ we found no evidence that a woman ’s overall cancer risk was decreased if she generally ate organic food ’			1
i repeat what i wrote then : that the @entity268 responded on its website that the public should treat this report from the pre-eminent @entity151 cancer research charity ‘ with a pinch of organic salt ’			0
what else is this but an attempt to continue to persuade families that they should be scared of getting cancer from eating food grown with pesticides ? indeed , on its website , under the headline ‘ @entity296 ’ the @entity268 states : ‘ the most dangerous chemicals used in farming , such as organophosphates , have been linked with a range of problems , including cancer			0
’ again , this is a clear attempt to scare the public about the ( non-existent ) enhanced risk of cancer from food grown with chemicals			0
lord @entity261 ’s grandfather and great - grandfather must be turning in their graves : both were chairmen of @entity315			0
@entity316 , 24 , was killed five months ago on a roundabout in @entity318 , when her bike was struck by a lorry			0
last week a coroner found that ‘ the fundamental cause of this collision was @entity316 going through a red light			0
’ ghastly for her family to be told that it was her own fault : but perhaps the coroner ’s verdict will cause more cyclists to realise that traffic lights are for their own protection , as well as that of pedestrians			0
as one of the latter group , i have three times in recent months been forced to take evasive action so as not to be struck by a cyclist hurtling through a red light			0
the most annoying aspect is that they tend to shout out as if you were the one committing an offence			0
