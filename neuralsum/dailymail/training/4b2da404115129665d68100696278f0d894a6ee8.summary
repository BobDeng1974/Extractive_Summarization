if you ’ve ever spilt water on a hot pan , you ’ve seen the @entity3 in action			1
the skittering and fizzing that takes place happens because the surface is super-hot - about twice as hot as the liquid 's boiling point			2
this causes the water to levitate on the evaporated gas vapour which acts a barrier that keeps the droplet and the hot surface separated			1
this causes the water to levitate on the evaporated gas vapour which acts a barrier that keeps the droplet and the hot surface separated when a liquid hits something really hot - about twice as hot as the liquid 's boiling point - it never comes directly in contact with its surface			1
this is because vapour acts as a barrier that keeps the two separated			0
the skittering of water you see when it hits a hot pan is the @entity3 effect			1
@entity42 ’s @entity41 and @entity40 looked at how droplets travel on different textured surfaces , heated at varying temperatures			0
they found that they could change the direction of the droplets ’ movement by changing the temperature of the ratcheted surface			1
they also found that droplets can be made to climb up a steep incline – the sharper the teeth of the surface , the steeper incline they were able to climb			0
and so the @entity57 was created			0
the maze guides the water droplets in different directions using specially - arranged grooved hotplates			0
‘ we think the droplets change direction depending on how fast the gas evaporates from the surface of the droplet and how much the droplet is levitating , combined with the effect of the textured surface that allows it to be propelled along and even go uphill , ’ said researcher @entity62			2
the research could be used to develop more sophisticated methods for controlling small droplets and heat transfer , such as cooling systems without moving parts			0
researchers at @entity42 have found that water droplets can be made to climb up a steep incline using the @entity83 effect – the sharper the teeth of the surface , the steeper incline they were able to climb the @entity57 guides water droplets in different directions using specially - arranged grooved hotplates			2

this is because of something known as the ' @entity3 '
the effect causes the water to levitate on the evaporated gas vapour
movement can be changed by *adjusting* the surface texture and temperature
