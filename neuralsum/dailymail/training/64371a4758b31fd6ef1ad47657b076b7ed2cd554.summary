a shortage of donor sperm has meant that @entity3 's supply has been severely depleted , resulting in moves for it to be provided from overseas instead			1
fertility clinics across the country are struggling to recruit enough local men as the demand now from single women and same - sex couples is too much			0
the number of people accessing donor insemination has also more than tripled in the past four years			2
another major effect is that donating sperm anonymously has been banned state - wide , and this has put many men off from donating sperm in recent years			1
culturally @entity3 lag behind most other countries when it comes to donating tissues or organs anyway			1
so there was never that many available sperm donors to begin with			2
a big increase in demand for donor sperm has seen fertility clinics looking further afield ' there is a serious shortage in donor sperm , ' associate professor @entity28 , medical director at @entity29 , said			1
' the demand is such from the likes of single women and same - sex couples that overseas donations is definitely one way of meeting this shortfall			1
' so long as the same practices that are required in @entity3 are followed overseas it will work			1
but other countries need to comply fully with all the ethical and legal standards set out in @entity3			1
' it is essential that full identification of each sperm donors is provided			2
in the past anonymity had persuaded men to donate sperm , but this is now a thing of the past			2
associate professor @entity28 advocates the full identification of each sperm donor ' it is very important that the donors are willing to leave their identity for the children when they get older			1
as a consequence of that we do n't have as many donors as we need , ' prof @entity28 said			0
' the actual legislation varies a little bit from one state to another			0
' but it is the case that in every state in @entity3 , donors do need to leave their identity , and nowhere in @entity3 is there totally anonymous sperm donations any more			1
' if the same practices that are required in @entity3 are followed overseas there should be no issues prof @entity28 said there were still many men who want to give their sperm so others can have a family , and to leave a bit of themselves behind on the planet , but nowhere near as many as before			1
' there 's a general acceptance that the old days of using anonymous sperm donors was not a good thing , and that there are a number of young adults who have been quite severely traumatised by the fact they ca n't track down where they have come from , ' prof @entity28 explained			2
what also affects the number of sperm donors productivity is that from state to state it varies as to how many families a donor can create			1
in @entity95 you are only allowed to use a donor to create five families , while in @entity99 and @entity100 it 's 10 families			2
because of the increased demand from couples , clinics now are looking at a range of options however , dr @entity107 , the scientific director of the @entity108 , believed that the main difference was that the likes of the @entity111 and other countries were more prepared to donate their tissues in the first place			1
' the anonymity factor has hurt us to an extent , but the number of sperm donors was never great to start with , ' dr @entity107 said			2
' @entity3 are notoriously poor tissue donors			2
we are one of the worst blood donor groups in the world for example			0
if you look at a propensity to donate @entity3 is right down at the bottom of the list			2
' it 's a cultural thing			0
people in the @entity111 and @entity131 are more likely to donate their blood or their organs			0
it 's hardly surprising therefore that they 're more willing to donate their sperm			0
' we just have to try and encourage people here to be more generous			0
' in their annual report the @entity138 said the number of donors whose sperm was available on july 1 dropped by 23 per cent compared to the previous year			0
increased communication internationally means the best sperm donors can be found ' the number of men signing up to become sperm donors has dwindled from 64 to 61 , because the demand has been so great			0
the number the number of women using donor insemination increased from 92 in 2009 - 10 to 311 this year , ' explained @entity138 chief executive , @entity153			0
' some clinics in @entity100 have been investigating importing donor sperm			1
the important thing is that regardless of where the donors come from they still need to be identifiable , altruistic , and their details need to be accessible to the who are children born who will want to know this information			0
' all the requirements under @entity100 legislation need to be meet concerning overseas donors			0
' @entity138 chief executive , @entity153 , believes all appropriate criteria must be met by overseas donors @entity153 said that because of the increased demand clinics are looking at a range of options			0
' @entity100 clinics are still looking to expand their recruitment methods locally but checking overseas options as well			0
but they must be aware of the implications of donating and meet our criteria , ' she said			0
sourcing the appropriate sperm donors overseas is getting easier though			2
' with increased communication internationally it 's less of a hurdle to find the right sperm donor overseas			1
people are using @entity186 to discuss possible donation			0
counsellors here use @entity186 as a method of communicating with donors as well , ' @entity153 said			0
the rise in same - sex couples wanting a child has forced some to look abroad for sperm donors the age reported that @entity197 is currently recruiting donors through a sperm bank in @entity200 in the @entity111 in the hope that @entity3 patients will have access to imported donor sperm by mid- 2015			1
' the issue in @entity100 has been the legislation , which allows identification as a right to the offspring when they turn 18 , so what we 've discussed with a group in @entity111 is for them to recruit sperm donors who are happy to meet those requirements , ' medical director dr @entity205 said			0
culturally @entity3 are adverse to donating blood or organs			1
the same goes for sperm @entity197 saw the biggest decline in donor sperm supply last year			1
the number of new donors recruited increased from 42 to 44 in 12 months , but available donor sperm plummeted from 104 to eight over the same period .			1

importing donor sperm from overseas is only way to *bridge* the shortfall
banning sperm donated anonymously has also made a huge difference
donating tissues or organs has always been culturally *frowned* upon
other countries must comply with ethical and legal standards in @entity3
