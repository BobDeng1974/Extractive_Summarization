three @entity1 - born scientists have won the @entity2 in physics for inventing blue - light emitting diodes that have revolutionised the lighting industry			1
@entity7 and @entity8 of @entity1 and @entity10 scientist @entity9 won the award for their 1990s invention , which has led to the use of environmentally - friendly light sources worldwide			1
but when @entity9 invented the technology in 1993 , the company he worked for at the time awarded him the equivalent of just £ 125 ( $ 200 ) - despite the idea being worth a potential £ 50 billion ( $ 80 billion ) by 2020 according to estimates			1
the lighting breakthrough creates more energy - efficient home lighting , and can improve keyhole surgery techniques the @entity29 said the invention is just 20 years old , ' but it has already contributed to create white light in an entirely new manner to the benefit of us all			1
' in this image @entity9 demonstrates different led lights during a presentation in @entity38 @entity9 invented the blue light - emitting - diode while working for the @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity1 in 1993			1
estimates suggest the technology , used in everything from homes to billboards today , will be worth £ 50 billion ( $ 80 billion ) in 2020 according to @entity47			1
but when he first came up with @entity40 rewarded him with just 20,000 yen ( £ 125 or $ 200 ) , as @entity1 firms favoured the mentality that work for an employer was not a means for personal glory			1
however @entity9 quit and moved to the @entity10 in 2000 , before counter-suing in 2001 after @entity40 attempted to sue him for infringing trade secrets			1
107 @entity2 in @entity24 have been awarded between 1901 - 2013			2
47 @entity54 have been given to one laureate only			0
2 women have been awarded the @entity57 so far			2
1 person , @entity58 , has been awarded the @entity57 twice			2
25 years was the age of the youngest physics laureate ever , @entity61 , when he was awarded the @entity62 together with his father			0
55 is the average age of the @entity65 the year they were awarded the prize			0
source : @entity2 he was ultimately awarded £ 5.04 million ( $ 8.1 million ) for the idea , reported as the largest payout ever made to an employee for an invention			1
the @entity29 said that while the technology is just 20 years old , ' it has already contributed to create white light in an entirely new manner to the benefit of us all			2
' @entity7 , 85 , is a professor at @entity78 and distinguished professor at @entity80			1
@entity8 , 54 , is also a professor at @entity80 , while the 60 - year - old @entity9 is a professor at the @entity38 , @entity38			1
the laureates triggered a transformation of lighting technology when they produced bright blue light from semiconductors , something scientist had struggled with for decades , the @entity2 committee said			1
using the blue light , @entity89 lamps emitting white light could be created in a new way			1
' as about one fourth of world electricity consumption is used for lighting purposes , the leds contribute to saving the @entity98 's resources , ' the committee said			1
led bulbs ( pictured ) last for 100,000 hours compared with 10,000 hours for fluorescent tubes and 1,000 hours for tungsten filament light @entity100 also use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs			1
' they succeeded where everyone else had failed , ' the @entity2 committee added			0
' incandescent light bulbs lit the 20th century ; the 21st century will be lit by led lamps			1
led bulbs last for 100,000 hours compared with 10,000 hours for fluorescent tubes and 1,000 hours for tungsten filament light bulbs			2
they also use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs			1
professor @entity7 said in a nationally - televised news conference that he had often been told that his research would n't bear fruit within the 20th century			1
' but i never felt that way , ' he said			0
' i was just doing what i wanted to do			0
' the benefits of increased efficiency could go far beyond home lighting , and the researchers are now looking at applications that extend from biomedicine to power electronics			2
the @entity126 , for instance , is planning to build tiny led devices that can be implanted by keyhole surgery in cancer patients being treated with radiotherapy			0
the laureates triggered a transformation of lighting technology when they produced bright blue light from semiconductors in the 1990s , something scientist had struggled with for decades , the @entity2 committee said			1
journalists waiting for the beginning of this morning 's press conference are pictured ' if a patient moves while an x-ray or proton beam is directed at their tumour , then they risk healthy tissue being damaged , ' explained sir @entity148 from the @entity149			2
' an led attached to a sensor would detect movement at the site of the tumour in order to redirect the beam			0
' last year 's physics award went to @entity158 's @entity157 and @entity160 colleague @entity159 for helping to explain how matter formed after the @entity161			2
up to three @entity2 laureates and two different works can be selected for the @entity24			0

2013 briton @entity157 and @entity160 @entity165 scoop the prize for successfully predicting the existence of the @entity205 particle – the ' @entity207 particle ' found by @entity208 in 2012 that could explain why matter has mass. compared with other @entity2 , some believe the nomination and selection process for the prize in @entity24 is much longer and far more rigorous			0
@entity2 season began yesterday with the announcement of the 102nd @entity2 for physiology or medicine			0
the prize is awarded for ' the most important discovery ' , rather than for a lifetime 's portfolio of work by a researchers , doctor or scientist			0
yesterday 's prize was given to @entity227 at @entity228 , and the @entity230 husband - and - wife team , @entity231 and @entity232			2
the team discovered cells in the brain that act as the body 's internal global positioning system			0
the @entity2 will be handed out on december 10 , which is also the anniversary of prize founder @entity238 's ( left ) death in 1896			1

@entity249 told three @entity178 @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 , that they could not accept their award			0
they all later received the @entity256 , but not the prize amount			0
@entity258 , the 1958 @entity259 , initially accepted the @entity2 but was later coerced by the authorities of the @entity261 to decline			0
source : @entity2 winners must be alive , but they are not contacted until very shortly before the official announcement			0
this rule proved problematic in 2011 , when it was discovered that @entity267 @entity266 , had died of cancer four days before being told about his @entity2			0
the @entity269 will be announced tomorrow , and the @entity259 on thursday			0
this will be followed by the award of the @entity2 peace prize on friday and the @entity2 in economics will be announced on monday			0
winners in all categories receive 8.0 million @entity277 kronor this year – just over £ 690,000 or $ 1.1 million			1
the @entity2 will be handed out on december 10 , the anniversary of prize founder @entity238 's death in 1896			1
from 1901 to 2013 , 876 have received @entity2 including the likes of @entity168 , @entity281 and @entity282 .			0

award given to @entity7 and @entity8 at @entity80 , @entity1 and @entity9 at @entity38 at @entity38
they invented blue light - emitting diodes - a low - energy light source
but when @entity9 first came up with the technology in 1993 his company only gave him the equivalent of £ 125 ( $ 200 )
this was despite the idea being worth a potential £ 50bn ( $ 80bn ) by 2020
about one fourth of world electricity consumption is used for lighting
the new blue @entity89 could contribute to saving the @entity98 's resources
leds use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs
@entity308 will receive 8 million @entity277 kronor - £ 690,000 or $ 1.1 million
@entity57 will given on december 10 , the anniversary of @entity238 's death
