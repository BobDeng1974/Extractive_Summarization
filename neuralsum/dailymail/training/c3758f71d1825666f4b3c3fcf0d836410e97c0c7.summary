dna testing has been used to identify the eye and hair colour of human remains up to 800 years old			1
the new genetic technique is expected to provide intriguing detail about what historical figures looked like			0
it has already been shown to be a potentially valuable tool for police and forensics experts trying to identify modern remains but has now been shown to be effective for teeth and bones hundreds of years old			1
tests on the remains of @entity18 war hero general @entity17 adys ¿ aw @entity19 revealed he had blue eyes			1
among the remains tested was a tooth from a woman found , to the astonishment of archaeologists , alongside those of abbots in a monastery near @entity29 in @entity18			1
analysis of a sample taken from the woman , who was buried in in the crypt of the @entity33 and @entity34 in the @entity35 some time in the 12th to 14th centuries , revealed that she most likely had blue eyes and dark blonde hair			2
quite why she and another woman were buried with the monks , however , remains a mystery			1
the results of analysis of 24 bone and tooth samples was said to show that the system offers a valuable new tool to archaeologists			0
' overall , we demonstrate that the @entity54 system is suitable , sufficiently sensitive androbust to successfully predict eye and hair colour from ancient and contemporary skeletalremains , ' the research team concluded			2
' our findings , therefore , highlight the @entity54 system as a promising tool in futureroutine forensic casework involving skeletal remains , including ancient dna studies , for theprediction of eye and hair colour of deceased individuals			1
' researchers were able to use the technique to confirm @entity18 @entity70 hero general @entity19 had light blonde hair and blue eyes			1
a skull from a woman found buried alongside monks in a crypt in @entity18			1
contemporary accounts described him as having blonde hair and blue eyes but there are no colour photographs of him , while a colour portrait was painted after his death			2
@entity19 was commander - in - chief of the @entity86 and was prime minister of the @entity18 government in exile until he was killed in an airplane crash at @entity91 in 1943			2
after being exhumed in 1993 from a cemetery in @entity94 his remains were placed in athe crypt of the cathedral of the @entity97 on @entity98 in @entity29			0
however , in 2008 he was exhumed once again amid doubts the aircraft crash that killed him was an accident			0
dna testing confirmed the body in the crypt was his and researchers also took the opportunity to test for eye and hair colour using @entity54			2
the tests were 99 per cent certain that the @entity19 had blue eyes and 69.5 per cent certain that his hair was a light blonde			0
dr @entity113 , from the @entity114 and @entity115 , @entity29 , led the study and said : ‘ this system can be used to solve historical controversies where colour photographs or other records are missing			0
‘ @entity54 was able to confirm that general @entity19 , who died in a plane crash in 1943 , had the blue eyes and blond hair present in portraits painted years after his death			0
‘ some of our samples were from unknown inmates of a @entity70 prison			0
' in these cases @entity54 helped to put physical features to the other dna evidence			0
