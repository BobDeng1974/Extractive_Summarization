a poll has revealed that one in seven @entity1 do n't know how to tell the time on a clock face			1
pictured is @entity4 , who famously admitted he did n't know to do so the @entity7 mathematician and science fiction writer @entity5 famously wrote that time makes fools of us all '			1
he would probably have been pretty horrified to discover that one in seven @entity1 admit they ca n't tell time on a non-digital watch			2
a new poll by an online watch retailer has uncovered a worrying trend amongst @entity1 with regards to telling the time , with many parents not teaching their young children how			1
the issue hit the headlines during the most recent i 'm a celebrity , @entity21 , where 23 year old @entity22 star @entity4 admitted he could not fathom the myriad intricacies of the two arms on a clock			1
firstly , the poll aimed to determine whether more @entity1 owned digital or non-digital watches			1
a fifth , 19 per cent , claimed to own a digital watch , while 52 per cent had an analogue watch of some description			2
all respondents were then asked if they could tell the time on a non-digital watch , with 14 per cent stating ‘ no ’			2
however , 32 per cent of these respondents said that they actually owned a non-digital watch , meaning that they wore one but could n’t properly use it			0
when asked why they had a non-digital watch if they could n’t even tell the time , the majority ( 67 per cent ) said it was just a fashion accessory , while 17 per cent said that they planned to get round to learning at some point			0
a total of 47 per cent said that they had simply never been taught how , whilst 31 per cent claimed it was because they had never needed to learn			0
all respondents were then asked which accessories or devices they used the most to tell the time			0
the majority , 45 per cent , admitted to using their mobile phone the most to find out what the time was , while 27 per cent used a watch and 19 per cent used a computer , laptop or tablet			0
not that hard : when asked why they had a watch if they could n’t even tell the time , 67 per cent said it was just a fashion accessory six per cent said they used their tv to find out the time amd three per cent said they tended to ask somebody else			0
according to the poll of 2,197 people by @entity71 , 37 per cent of the parents taking part with children aged 10 or under said they had not or did n’t plan to teach their children to read the time on non-digital watches 19 per cent claimed to own a digital watch 52 per cent had an analogue watch 37 per cent wo n't teach kids to tell time 14 per cent ca n't tell time , and of them ... 32 per cent owned an analogue watch and ... 67 per cent admitted it was for style statement the majority , 61 per cent , explained that they did n’t see the need because time was now , more often than not , displayed in a digital format			1
@entity92 , founder of @entity93 , said the following about the findings : ' it ’s shocking to see that as many as one in seven @entity1 adults ca n’t tell the time on a non-digital watch			1
with so many gadgets providing the time in a digital format however , it ’s easy to see how some people just never feel the need to learn			0
' i really ca n’t believe that 37 per cent of parents with young children do n’t see the importance of teaching their children how to tell the time on an analogue watch – there will inevitably come a time in their life when they need to read the time in a non-digital format and instead they ’re going to have to rely on others			2
' more people use their mobile phones to tell the time than any other method , which seems funny to me because perhaps even those with watches on will be delving into their pockets to find their handset when they could just look at their wrist for a time check			0

a poll has discovered that many adults *struggle* with simple task
many parents are not *bothering* to teach their kids how
@entity4 famously *highlighted* the issue on i 'm a celeb ...
