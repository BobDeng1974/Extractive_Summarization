by @entity0 published : 07:55 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 11:12 est , 18 march 2013 he has spent his life collecting every number one record released over the past 61 years			2
but , following huge changes in technology , record fanatic @entity5 has had to give up his obsession			1
the company director had wanted to own every number one in the singles chart			0
however , that became impossible after @entity15 's recent hit @entity16 was only made available as a download			1
@entity19 fan : @entity5 from the @entity20 and his dog @entity21 surrounded by his collection of every @entity25 number one single since the charts came into existence in 1952 disappointed mr @entity5 , 47 , who had collected more than 1,200 records , said : ' i have been beaten by technology , i am afraid			1
that is the way records are sold these days and my obsession is over			0
' while many download singles have previously reached number one , starting with crazy by @entity38 in 2006 , they have either been released in physical form subsequently or been available as promotional or import @entity40 mr @entity5 , from @entity42 , @entity20 , added : ' it has been getting harder and harder to get hold of physical copies of number one hits			1
' luckily i had friends who were djs or who worked in radio stations and gave me promo copies but i could see this day approaching some way off			0
dedicated : here in my heart , by @entity53 , the earliest single held by mr @entity5 and right @entity56 by @entity59 - mr @entity5 's favorite single in his collection diverse : mr @entity5 's collection includes the @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and the @entity66 ' i started in 1998 , the year my son was born and i thought it would be interesting to collect every number one of that year as a memento			1
thwarted : @entity15 's recent hit @entity16 was only made available as a download ' when that was over i thought i would try to get every chart - topper ever made and it was great fun filling the gaps			1
' hunting them all down was an obsession of sorts			0
' i have to decide now if i should carry on with that missing record as a gap			0
i am finding it hard to let my addiction go			0
' mr @entity5 's collection includes the @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and the @entity66			1
his favourite is @entity59 ' 1962 hit ' @entity87 ' and the one he hates most is @entity89 's ' @entity88 ' produced in 2006			2
' i feel sorry for kids today because they will have no physical records , no chance to create a collection like mine			2
' i think people like hard copies to remind them of key moments in their life , something to look back on in the years ahead			0
' all those vinyl albums and their wonderful sleeves will be a thing of the past			0
this is all very sad for us record collectors			0
' @entity107 's comeback single , where are we now ? , was released as a download earlier this year and quickly topped the @entity110 chart			2
however , it was not an official number one because it was given away for free , meaning that it does not count for the purposes of mr @entity5 's collection .			1
