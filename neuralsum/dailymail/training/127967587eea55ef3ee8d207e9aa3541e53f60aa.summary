a @entity1 mother was left red - faced with embarrassment and then burning with rage after her four - year - old son was banned from a doughnut shop for asking if a lady was pregnant on tuesday			1
@entity7 said when her son mistakenly asked a customer in @entity11 's @entity10 on monday if she was carrying a child - she was understandably mortified			1
however , the next day when they tried to walk back in , they ' were screamed at in front of the door , ' said @entity17			0
they said her son , @entity19 , was not ' allowed in here ' because he ' is rude			2
' scroll down for @entity21 children say the darndest things : @entity19 was banned from his local doughnut shop for asking the wrong question to a lady who was not pregnant recalling her inquisitive son 's error on monday , @entity17 said that when the woman said ' no ' to being pregnant , her son said sorry but she was suitably shocked			1
' my response was ' oh my goodness , i 'm so embarrassed , i 'm so sorry ' , @entity17 said to @entity34			2
seriously ? @entity7 has said that now she has calmed down she will no longer be spending any more money at the doughnut store in @entity11 , @entity1 no more food : the doughnut shop has banned the 4 - year - old for his question to a lady who was not pregnant the lady in question even said it was okay , but the managers at the @entity10 apparently did not see it the same way when they tried to walk in on tuesday			1
' she said , ' he 's not allowed in here , ' and i looked around , and said , ' him ? ' and she said ' yeah , he 's rude ' , ' @entity17 said to @entity34			0
leaving the store to take their money elsewhere , @entity17 has said she has tried to explain the situation to her son and that he ' sort of ' understands			0
' some people , unfortunately are quick to pass judgment , and therefore we will take our money and business elsewhere , ' @entity17 added .			0
