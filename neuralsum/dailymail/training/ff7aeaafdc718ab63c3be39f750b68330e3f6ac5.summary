' ' they see their coaches sleeping with girls , ' @entity87 said			0
' when they become a coach			0
... ( they ) get access to sexual relationships with young , fit teenage girls – and it 's just part of the culture			2
everybody thinks that 's ok			0
' in her interview with @entity62 , @entity45 said she knew from the beginning that her relationship with @entity6 was inappropriate			1
' i knew that because he made it be a secret , ' she said			2
' but i will say that the 15 - year - old thought it was exciting			1
' @entity45 said she did n't tell anyone what had happened for years			0
' the first five to seven years after it happened , i was scared , ' she told the radio station			0
' i was petrified , because i was young and in speedskating , and i was knocking on the door to the junior national team , then the senior national team , and i did n't want to do anything to jeopardize that			0

' and it took a long time and a lot of work and some pretty dark times to come to grips with it and put myself together			0
' ' i wanted to be close and real with friends in skating , but there was this big secret and there was this big part i was n't disclosing , ' she said			0
