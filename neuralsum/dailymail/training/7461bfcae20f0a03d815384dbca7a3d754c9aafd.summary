she said : ' he had a fight with one of my friend ’s dogs in the park and then he attacked our female bulldog as well			2
' i did n’t trust him very much if i ’m honest			0
after he attacked the other two dogs it really scared me and i wanted him put down			2
' the mother - of - three , of @entity53 , @entity54 , added : ' there was another incident in about may last year where the same dog killed our family cat			1
' @entity34 ’s ex @entity61 said there were also two incidents involving the former couple ’s sons last summer			0
he said : ' my older son , who was 16 at the time , was chased by the four dogs in the park			2
they just kept jumping up at him and trying to grab him			0
brutal : the court heard how all of the dogs , including two @entity19 mastiffs , two @entity24 bulldogs and a small mongrel ( all pictured ) , have been put down after all their bite marks were found on mrs @entity2 ' body ' and a couple of months later they attacked my 10 - year - old son and he had quite severe bite marks on his arm			1
' it also emerged the dogs had also savaged mrs @entity2 the previous summer			1
but instead of putting it down the family , who had six dogs at that time , got rid of two other dogs , leaving them with four in their home in @entity53 , @entity54			2
recording a narrative verdict , @entity96 coroner @entity95 , said : ' it would appear that all four dogs had a history of behaving in ways that were inappropriate			1

' ms @entity95 said mrs @entity2 apparently did n't trust the @entity38 as it had previously jumped up and bit her hand			1
she said the series of attacks suggested that all the dogs were ' out of control ' having all shown evidence of ' behaving aggressively before this incident '			1
' i think it is very , very sad the dogs that chased @entity34 ’s son and had bitten mrs @entity2 before unfortunately acted in the way that they did the day of the attack and took mrs @entity2 ' life			1
' @entity34 ’s ex-husband @entity61 told the coroner he did n’t have the dogs put down because he ' believed they needed some more time spent on training them '			2

the other four dogs were behind the stair gate in the conservatory			0
' i noticed a pile of clothes in the garden			0
i thought the dogs had pulled the washing off the line then i saw it was mrs @entity2			1
it was only then i saw blood around the dogs mouths and two of the dogs were covered in blood			0
' mrs @entity2 was pronounced dead at 6.24pm			2
a post mortem found she died of shock and blood loss			0

he said : ' there is evidence from a surgeon who examined mrs @entity2 body that given the measurements of the dental casts taken from the dogs that all the dogs had at some stage bitten her			1
' animals removed : police have seized the two @entity19 mastiffs , the @entity24 bulldogs and the mongrel and are in police - approved kennels pending the post-mortem tragedy : dog baskets and food bowls can be seen in the garden at the scene where @entity2 may have been mauled to death by the animals the dogs have since been destroyed after police ruled they were a danger to the public			1
mrs @entity2 , who was described as a ‘ very placid person who was always on the go doing housework or gardening ’ had helped run a family pie shop in @entity9 , south @entity234 , for several generations			1
