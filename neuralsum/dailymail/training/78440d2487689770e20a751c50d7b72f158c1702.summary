by @entity1 reporter published : 19:39 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 19:39 est , 16 july 2012 three elderly @entity2 who claim they were tortured under @entity4 rule will today demand an apology and damages at the @entity7			1
the trio say they suffered ‘ unspeakable acts of brutality ’ in @entity4 - run detention camps during the @entity10 between 1952 and 1960			1
if they win their case , it could lead to thousands more demanding compensation via no - win no - fee lawyers			1
@entity2 ( l - r ) @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 appearing outside the @entity7 last year			2
they are taking the @entity4 government to court over allegations that they were tortured during the @entity10 uprising the claimants are expected in a two - week hearing to give moving testimony at the @entity7 in @entity27			2
the @entity28 , which denies liability , said they had left it too late to claim			2
archbishop @entity31 has urged @entity32 to concede the case , accusing the government of continuing to refuse to deal with ‘ these elderly torture victims with the dignity they deserve '			1
@entity37 says she suffered appalling sexual abuse			1
@entity39 says he was suspended by his feet and beaten unconscious in an incident in which 11 men were clubbed to death			2
he claims cold water was poured on his face to stop him breathing			2
and @entity46 , 85 , is expected to tell the court he was castrated during the atrocities allegedly committed at the hands of @entity4 soldiers			2
all three were held in detention camps during the 1950s			2
the @entity28 , which denies liability , said the group had left it too late to claim			0
archbishop @entity31 adds in his letter : ' it is high time that the @entity59 showed some magnanimity and compassion			1
' angry : archbishop @entity31 has urged @entity32 to concede the case , accusing the government of continuing to refuse to deal with ' these elderly torture victims with the dignity they deserve ' a year ago the @entity2 won a historic ruling which took them one step nearer to achieving their goal when mr @entity69 said they had ' arguable cases in law '			1
the fresh hearing will focus on the government 's argument that the claims can not proceed because they have been brought outside the legal time limit - but lawyers for the @entity2 will argue that it is an exceptional case in which the judge should exercise his discretion in their favour			1
in his letter to mr @entity32 , archbishop @entity31 accuses the government of ' relying on legal technicalities in response to allegations of torture of the worst kind '			1
the claims are being brought with the support of the @entity91 and the @entity2 government			0
issue : archbishop @entity31 urged @entity32 not to relying on legal technicalities solicitor @entity95 , senior partner from law firm @entity95 , said : ' the history of what happened to the @entity10 in @entity2 during the 1950s at the hands of the @entity4 is a very sorry and distressing tale			1
it is however a tale that has to be told , if we as the @entity4 people are to learn from the mistakes of the past			0
' he said his firm 's clients had been ' waiting for this day for a long time ' , adding : ' we are pleased for them that at long last they have their chance to give their evidence to the court			0
our clients are elderly with likely few years left to live			0
' initially , there were four claimants but one has died since the case was started in 2009			1
mr @entity95 said the claimants wanted an apology and a @entity10 welfare fund to ensure that they , and their comrades , could live with an element of dignity in their final days			0
opening the case for the @entity2 , @entity124 said the crux issue was whether a fair trial was still possible			1
he argued that the existence of thousands of official records and other sources of primary contemporary documentation meant a fair trial was possible , despite the passage of time and the death of certain witnesses			0
he acknowledged the task was going to be painstaking and time - consuming			0
he said : ' it is going to take a long time , cost a lot of money and occupy court time			0
all that gives rise to notions of proportionality			0
' but he said it was an important case and the court should not be put off by its complexity			1
however the @entity28 argued the case should be thrown out			1
its @entity124 , @entity151 , said : ' it would be contrary to principle and the balance of fairness to allow this matter to proceed to a trial			0
there can not be a fair trial of the issues			0
' he said that the @entity28 faced ' irredeemable difficulties ' in respect of the availability of witnesses and documents in defending the claim			0
those in senior positions in the @entity169 , the @entity170 , the @entity171 and the @entity172 would ideally be called as witnesses - but most of them were now dead , he said			0
' without those witnesses , and indeed with the necessarily limited recollections of those who do survive , the very complicated and difficult task of determining the competing factual positions can not be fairly conducted , ' the @entity175 a written submission , the @entity28 declared : ' after so long , it is simply impossible			0
