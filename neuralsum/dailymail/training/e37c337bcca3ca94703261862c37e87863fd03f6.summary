by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:38 est , 7 february 2014 @entity3 : 05:42 est , 7 february 2014 @entity9 ’s victory in the @entity7 must not be celebrated , the minister in charge of marking the centenary of the @entity7 has warned			1
@entity10 said although the war was an ‘ absolute vital victory ’ for @entity9 there should be no ‘ triumphant fanfares ’ throughout the next four years of commemorations			1
but historians warned the stance showed a ‘ lack of understanding ’ about how the war was won			0
events to mark the centenary of the @entity7 must not repeat the jubilant scenes in 1918 when the @entity25 was announced , ministers warned @entity26 has pledged a ‘ truly national commemoration ’ in 2014 to remember the start of the ‘ war to end all wars ’			1
the prime minister has promised a four - year £ 50million programme to commemorate the 100 - year anniversary , culiminating in events in 1918 to mark the end of the conflict			1
but miss @entity10 warned against striking the wrong tone , insisting there must be no ‘ daning in the streets			1
she wrote in @entity41 : ‘ we wo n't be shying away from the fact that , in the end , it was an absolutely vital victory for us that changed the course of world history in countless ways , but we wo n't be celebrating that fact or sounding triumphant fanfares			1
‘ do n't forget that , as well as changing history , the conflict claimed the lives of around sixteen million people across the world , and injured a further twenty million			0
‘ the tone has to be right , not four years of gloom and misery , but no dancing in the street either			1
’ the government has promised a four - year £ 50million programme of events to mark the centenary of the @entity7 the government has been faced with a difficult balancing act over how to mark the war , in which @entity9 emerged victories but millions died			1
historian @entity68 , professor of war studies at the @entity70 said : ‘ what i think they ’ve got wrong , and it ’s caused some concern among military historians for example , is that among the great set - piece commemorations they are not including the great victories of 1918 which actually ended the war			2
‘ that shows a lack of understanding of the basic facets of the history of the @entity7 , ’ he told @entity81			0
‘ i think avoiding triumphalism is absolutely correct			0
nobody wants a triumphalist approach			0
but we ’ve got to be aware that celebrating can mean different things			0
celebrating in the sense of acknowledging the national effort made during the war is entirely appropriate			0
‘ we must not lose sight of the fact that the war was fought by @entity9 to counter largely @entity99 aggression and involved a huge national effort on the battle front and home front			0
’ the debate follows a row sparked by education secretary @entity105 when he suggested popular shows like @entity107 were being used as a propaganda tool by ‘ left - wing academics ’			2
mr @entity105 told the @entity110 that the left insisted on peddling myths about the @entity7 , which have served to ‘ denigrate virtues such as patriotism , honour and courage ’			0
@entity117 minister @entity10 said there must not be four years of gloom and misery , but also ' no dancing in the street either ' while @entity124 's shadow education secretary @entity123 has also cautioned against a triumphalist tone he wrote : ‘ the conflict has , for many , been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as @entity127 , @entity129 and @entity107 , as a misbegotten shambles - a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out - of - touch elite			1
even to this day there are left - wing academics all too happy to feed those myths			2
’ his remarks saw him clash with @entity107 star sir @entity137 who accused mr @entity105 of making a ‘ very silly mistake ’			0
@entity139 education secretary @entity123 also waded into the argument condemning the conservatives for attempting to politicise the 2014 anniversary of the start of the war			2
deputy prime minister @entity145 later stepped in to insist the @entity146 was taking a ‘ dispassionate ’ reflection of the lessons learnt from the ‘ shocking scale of bloodshed ’			2
last night mr @entity123 told @entity81 he was pleased the government had now adopted a more reflective and respectful tone following ms @entity10 's comments .			1
