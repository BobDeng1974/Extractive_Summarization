so this week 's big thing is to add up how much @entity1 has spent at @entity2 and conclude that he 's useless			1
i 'm all for scrutinising players , managers and others in the game – that 's what i do			0
but it 's always good to retain a bit of perspective when throwing that spotlight on some of the people involved at the sharp end			0
they were a joy to watch , in fact his @entity2 team last season were the pioneers of the new attacking style adopted by the @entity35			2
of course @entity36 was a huge part of that – but the way @entity1 oversaw the development of @entity18 , @entity42 and @entity43 can not be ignored			1
all three played a massive part in that fantastic football we all enjoyed last season			0
@entity1 also did something that no other manager had done before – he trusted @entity50			1
the striker repaid that faith , and both @entity2 and @entity53 benefited			0
captain @entity20 , @entity54 and @entity19 look dejected after the loss at @entity56 the loss of @entity36 , who scored 31 goals last season , to @entity60 has hit @entity2 hard @entity2 desperately need @entity50 back from injury and firing again @entity2 find themselves in seventh in the @entity35 table after an indifferent start to the season there were so many examples of good management from @entity1 last season , and they should n't be so easily forgotten			1
to take a team from seventh position to second is some achievement			0
the fact that a slip at the end cost @entity2 the title had the effect of making too many people judge the season as a failure			1
@entity1 ' management was magnificent last season and this campaign is proving trickier			2
four defeats in 10 @entity35 games and a stuttering @entity85 effort is n't good , and i 'll be massively impressed if @entity1 can get a consistent run of performances from @entity19			0
and it would be no surprise if @entity2 are well beaten by @entity24 on tuesday night			0
@entity19 has scored just twice for @entity2 since arriving from @entity91 at the end of the transfer window @entity2 come up again @entity94 and the might of @entity24 in the @entity85 next for the side that finished seventh in the @entity35 two years ago to even be on the same pitch as the @entity100 champions is some achievement , and the @entity2 manager deserves huge credit			1
he 's got enough in the bank to be above the kind of scrutiny he 's being subjected to right now			0
the start of the season has n't been what @entity2 expected and wanted – you do n't need to have played the game to work that one out			2
but after what he did last season - and just 10 games into this - i think we should still be focusing more on @entity1 ' achievements , rather than what has gone wrong this season			2
@entity119 @entity2 can still progress - @entity1			1

@entity2 have started the season poorly at home and in @entity100
manager @entity1 has come in for harsh *criticism*
but fans should remember how close they came to the title last season
@entity130 brought on @entity43 , @entity18 and @entity42
@entity1 has been *unfortunate* with @entity50 's injury this season
