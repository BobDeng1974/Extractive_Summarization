this is the moment a mysterious flying object was caught on camera as it hovered in the night sky			1
footage of the @entity5 - a dome - shaped object with pulsating lights - was taken from outside a home in @entity9 , @entity10			2
@entity11 , a venture capitalist , said he was letting his dog into the garden at about 11.30pm on monday when he spotted the unidentified object hanging in the distance			1
the object , which is made up of flashing white and purple lights , hovers in the sky for two minutes while mr @entity11 records its movements			1
the 43 - year - old told @entity33 that he originally thought it was a plane travelling on ' an unusual flight path '			1
but he quickly realised it was ' an unusual colour for a plane ' and ' it was not moving as you would expect a plane to move '			0
mr @entity11 said it was at this point he went into his house to find his video camera			1
he said : ' i used the zoom so i could get a better look , and what i saw surprised me			0
it appeared to be a dome with a bulge in the middle and it had pulsating lights on it			0
' i am out at night a lot walking the dog but this was like nothing i have ever seen before			0
' flickering : the video first shows this speck of white light apparently flying somewhere in the distance hovering : the shape grows and appears to move closer to the camera - transforming into this purple dome @entity65 : mr @entity11 continues to film as it hovers for two minutes and moves erratically across the sky in the video , the object at first looks like a white speck of light that is somewhere in the distance			1
it then grows larger , and transforms into a diamond , or dome shape , as it hovers closer to the camera			0
the @entity5 appears to glow purple and white in the night sky , with a light quality that resembles static on a tv screen			2
mr @entity11 continues to film as it disappears back into the distance , before once again reappearing			2
last month , a similar unidentified object was captured as it hovered in the sky over @entity9			0
in the video , posted on @entity86 , the white pulsating light hovers in the sky , much like in mr @entity11 's footage , but it never grows into a larger object			1
and in 2006 , another @entity5 was photographed by a man in nearby @entity91			0
the spooky shot was captured by two men as they were taking photos of the sunset .			0

mysterious flying object was filmed from a back garden in @entity10
@entity11 was letting his dog out when he saw the flashing light
the 43 - year - old captured it on his video camera as it hovered in night sky
