three top retailers have been criticised by mental health charities for selling fancy dress costumes that appeared to trivialise mental health issues			1
supermarket giant @entity4 has announced it will make a £ 25,000 donation to the mental health charity mind after it apologised for advertising an outfit comprised of a ragged , blood - spattered straitjacket - and pictured worn by someone covered in blood and brandishing a machete - as a ' mental patient fancy dress costume '			1
@entity13 said shortly after that it would be removing the ' @entity15 ' costumes advertised on it own sites - a bright orange jumpsuit with the word ' committed ' on the back			1
stigma : @entity4 's ' mental patient costume ' ( left ) and @entity13 's ' @entity25 ' costume enhanced negative stereotypes of mentally ill people , charities said a number of traders on @entity30 are also selling a range of " psycho " costumes for both adults and children , but the online retailer has yet to comment			1
one , listed as a ' psycho costume ' , consists of a white shirt covered in ' blood ' , while another child 's ' psycho surgeon ' set shows a shirt and trouser set smeared with red paint			0
@entity13 said it was ' really sorry for any offence caused ' by the costume , which was worn on its website by a model in a brown mask , holding a syringe			2
the website description of the costume says : ' dress up as the most thrilling psycho killer character of all time in this @entity58 costume , consisting of a bright orange , long - sleeved boiler suit with zip fastener to front , ' @entity15 ' printed on the chest			2
' the same words ( are ) printed on the back in larger letters with a prominent ' committed ' stamp just below			0
' inappropriate : @entity30 also advertised a @entity15 costume - at a reduced price @entity4 's ' mental patient ' costume , which first provoked the storm , was designed to look like a blood - splattered straitjacket with ragged edges			1
it was on sale for £ 20 through the supermarket 's clothing arm @entity4			1
many took to @entity78 to express their disgust at the description including former footballer @entity81 , who has a well - documented battle with depression			1
he tweeted : ' @entity85 , nice stereotype of ' mental patients '			0
something you 'd expect from the £ £ £			0
a f * * * ing joke			0
' do you actually realise how many people are hanging themselves because of being frightened of the stigma ? wording is clear			0
' @entity4 yesterday apologised for the incident in a series of tweets , and announced the large donation it had made today			2
a spokesman for @entity4 declined to elaborate further on the donation , other than to say : ' this is a sincere gesture to apologise for the offence			2
we want to do this for the right reasons and not for publicity			0
' the company said : ' we 're deeply sorry one of our fancy dress costumes has upset people			1
this was an unacceptable error - the product was withdrawn immediately			0
bad taste : supermarket giant @entity4 has been forced to apologise after it advertised a fancy dress outfit featuring someone covered in blood and brandishing a machete as a ' mental patient fancy dress costume ' ' we 'd like to offer our sincere apologies for the offence it 's caused and will be making a sizeable donation to @ @entity122			1
' we removed the product from our website this afternoon but unfortunately the page may remain visible for a few more hours			0
' a @entity13 spokesman said : ' we 're really sorry for any offence this has caused and we are removing this product from sale			2
' a spokesman said the ' @entity25 ' costume was intended to refer to a ' film character ' and that after complaints from customers it had been withdrawn from sale and from the company 's website			2
former spin doctor @entity138 , who has also suffered from depression , told @entity140 : ' it underlines to me that we treat mental illness like it 's not serious			0
i 've had depression , i 've had psychosis			0
mental illness is scarier than most physical illnesses and i just can not understand what goes through the minds of intelligent business people			0
' we are trying to change attitudes towards mental illness ... but we are still in the dark ages if some of the biggest companies in this country - @entity13 , @entity4 , @entity30 - think that it 's acceptable to sell something like this			1
it 's unacceptable on every level			0
' @entity161 , chief executive of mental health charity @entity162 , said : ' we welcome @entity4 's withdrawal of the costume , which could only serve to reinforce prejudice and misperceptions of mental illness , leaving those already struggling with mental health problems more lonely and excluded			1
' outrage : many took to @entity78 to express their disgust at the description including former footballer @entity81 , who has a well - documented battle with depression stunned : former @entity178 spin doctor and mental health charity @entity176 were among the critics on @entity78 @entity181 , chief executive of the charity @entity176 , said : ' i am pleased to see @entity4 has now removed the costume from their website , but the fact it was ever there in the first place is completely unacceptable			1
@entity189 , campaigner for mental health charity @entity190 , told @entity192 's today programme : ' nine out of ten people using mental health services in patient care report stigma and discrimination from a range of sources			1
' stigma and discrimination is unfortunately still really damaging in @entity202 today and this kind of myth of the dangerousness posed by people , that you should be scared of anyone who has used mental health services , is really damaging			2
' ( @entity4 ) certainly crossed the line here and i hear it might well have been changed with the addition of mental patient , so it was definitely being used to tap into negative stereotypes			1
' ' this costume is breathtakingly insensitive , and it 's shocking that @entity4 ever felt it was an appropriate product to sell			2
there is already so much stigma surrounding mental illness , and ' joke ' products like this only serve to make things worse			0
' @entity224 , director of campaigns at the charity @entity226 , said : ' @entity4 has made a huge error of judgment in marketing this costume as ' mental health patient '			1
this costume just makes it harder for children and young people to speak out and get help about mental health			1
' one in ten children and young people have a diagnosable mental health problem , with many more out there struggling without being diagnosed			2
we need to create a climate of support around children and young people , not fear			0
' mistake : @entity4 has now withdrawn the product after apologising for an ' unacceptable error ' the row comes as new figures show that more than 30,000 people with mental health problems are dying needlessly every year from causes other than suicide			1
the government estimates around 100,000 people under 75 die every year from illnesses that could have been prevented through better medical treatment or interventions like stop smoking campaigns			0
a new report from the charity @entity176 has found around a third of these deaths are among people with mental health problems			1
they are more likely to die from preventable illness - such as cancer or heart disease - than the rest of the population			0
the study , @entity271 , calls on the government to do more to target this group , who have higher rates of illness through side - effects of medication , smoking , a lack of basic health checks on the @entity281 and professionals not taking their concerns seriously .			0

@entity4 ' mental patient ' fancy dress costume was on sale for £ 20
