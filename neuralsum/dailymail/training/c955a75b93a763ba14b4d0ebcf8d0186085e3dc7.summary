in their biggest rivals ’ backyard			0
for @entity2 , this is his @entity13			1
the team revolves around @entity2 , although with team - mates in attack such as @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , @entity5 are the @entity20 of national teams : they enjoy playing on the break , with pace			1
now or never : this summer 's @entity13 is the tournament which will see @entity2 at his peak absolutely everything has been done to ensure @entity5 , and @entity2 , arrive as serious contenders , including the appointment of a new coach			1
despite a 4 – 1 win against @entity31 in september 2010 , then manager @entity29 failed to combine the footballing growth of ‘ @entity33 ’ with a team that worked			0
he failed in the @entity35 held in @entity5 in 2011 , losing to @entity36 in the quarter - finals			1
@entity38 came in and lifted spirits without making too much noise			0
the four forwards ( @entity2 , @entity42 , @entity17 and @entity18 ) had been developing an understanding and would be sure starters			1
and in midfield , a combination of @entity47 ’s tactical discipline and @entity49 ’s touch made them leaders on and off the pitch			0
serious contenders : @entity5 coach @entity38 talks tactics with @entity2 during friday 's training session in 571 minutes of @entity13 football @entity2 has scored just one goal			1
@entity2 had @entity49 behind him and @entity17 as his partner up front in both his titles with @entity5 ( under 20 @entity13 and the @entity62 )			1
they were reunited under @entity38			0
@entity2 , alongside team - mates who were on the same wavelength , began playing with freedom			1
he started becoming @entity67 ’s @entity2			1
‘ the only thing i said as soon as i joined the national team was that he had to be left in peace , ’ says @entity38			0
‘ he once missed a penalty and it was as if an asteroid had struck the @entity74			0
please ! ‘ then they started , “ what if he ’s depressed ... what ’s happening to @entity2 ? ” it turns out that he scored five goals in the following two matches			1
we have to understand that @entity2 is a human being			1
’ @entity38 heeded advice from @entity85 , the former @entity67 coach : ‘ protect him with players who make his job simpler			1
’ and make him feel loved , he added			0
with that in mind , the new coach gave @entity2 the captaincy			2
former captain @entity47 says : ‘ i was the one who gave it to him			0
i told him i would no longer be captain			0
i told @entity2 he had to be captain because of everything he represented for us			2
all smiles : @entity47 ( right ) shares a joke with @entity49 , @entity100 and @entity19 ‘ he was saying , “ no ! how ? you are the captain ! ” and i was saying to him , “ no , @entity104 , it has to be you ”			0
that is if you ignore his early team talks			0
@entity67 ’s @entity109 recalls : ‘ he told me that in @entity5 they have a tradition of captains giving speeches before each match			1
when it was his turn , he said , “ there is no speech today			0
come on , let ’s get on the pitch ! ” in his first match as captain ! ’ but , according to @entity124 ’s @entity123 , @entity2 gradually adapted to the responsibilities			2
‘ at the beginning he would speak to us on a more individual basis , ’ says @entity123 , ‘ but now he says , “ this is @entity5 , let ’s go for it from the start , remember the importance to the country ”			1
’ every king needs a coronation and @entity2 ’s came on a very hot day in @entity137 , @entity138			2
@entity5 had already lost to @entity139 and drawn with @entity140 in their @entity13 qualifiers			2
‘ that match , when we came back with a spectacular second - half performance by @entity2 , was key , ’ remembers @entity143 writer @entity142			1
‘ he made us win			0
it was epic : a @entity2 who can give no more , dying from the heat , on the brink of exhaustion ... and he turned it around			2
’ at that moment @entity143 society became reconciled with @entity104			2
his performances under @entity155 ( 20 goals in 22 games , when under previous coaches he had scored 17 in 61 ) matched those of the team			0
@entity2 , @entity42 , @entity18 and @entity17 scored 90 per cent of @entity5 ’s goals in qualifying			1
the idea of not winning in @entity164 does not enter @entity2 ’s head			2
it eats away at him that , although he feels he is no 1 , he has not yet made history			0
high spirits : @entity2 laughs as @entity5 team - mate @entity47 falls to the ground during training ‘ if we come back after the quarter - finals they will lambast him again , ’ reflects @entity142			1
‘ if he wins , maybe @entity175 ( @entity174 ) will move aside			0
or we put both on the altar , father and son			0
