an airplane made an emergency landing at @entity2 in @entity3 late on tuesday after a female passenger became ill and the cabin crew grew concerned that she could have the deadly ebola virus			1
@entity7 from @entity8 was scheduled to land at @entity2 just after 11 pm , but just 20 minutes before landing the captain called to alert authorities that an unnamed passenger was displaying flu - like symptoms			1
with the entire country on high alert over the @entity18 outbreak in @entity3 , the crew of @entity14 were concerned that the passenger may have the deadly disease - despite the face she had come from @entity22 and not an infected region			1
@entity31 told @entity34 that it is ‘ highly unlikely ’ that the woman has @entity18			0
another important factor that makes @entity18 unlikely is that the woman was n't coming from an infected area			0
she had traveled from @entity40 , @entity22 through @entity41 to @entity8 and then on to @entity2			0
' at this point , we are considering it not to be @entity18 but we never want to rule anything completely out			0
it 's highly unlikely that it is @entity18 , ' said @entity31			0
the woman was transported to @entity48 following disease control procedures , but later released as local authorities determined it was ' highly unlikely ' that she has the ebola virus local authorities however were taking no chances on tuesday night and as the plane touched down on the tarmac , emergency crews were on hand and emergency lights flashing			1
@entity60 personnel boarded the plane in hazmat suits to assess the situation and the woman was transported to @entity48 following disease control procedures			2
after being monitored by local health and emergency management authorities , the woman was allowed to leave			2
officials have contact information for all 69 people aboard the flight and have asked that if any display any flu - like symptoms they are to immediately notify their local health department as a precautionary measure .			2

twenty minutes before landing the captain of @entity14 called ahead to say the crew were concerned about a passenger with flu - like symptoms
@entity18 was mentioned as a possible *diagnosis* and emergency personnel in hazmat suits boarded the plane once it landed
the woman had been vomiting but she did n't have a fever and was n't traveling from a country that has the deadly virus
local authorities now believe it is ' highly unlikely ' that the woman has @entity18 and she was allowed to leave the local *hospital*
@entity98 *patient* @entity97 passed away on *wednesday* at @entity99 after flying to @entity100 from @entity101 last month
