home captain @entity0 's career - best 192 was the highlight of day two between @entity2 and @entity3 in @entity4 , but the tourists will be pleased with how they dug in when their time came to bat			1
having witnessed the @entity8 up 530 from their overnight 295 for five , @entity3 - 2 - 0 down in the series - may have been expected to be worse off than they were at the close			1
they ended the day at the @entity14 on 108 for one , thanks to @entity16 's unbeaten 50 , and although work remains to be done , they can take heart from their defiance			1
@entity0 acknowledges the crowd after being dismissed on 192 runs against @entity3 in @entity4 @entity0 was eight runs short of a double century as @entity2 took control on the second day of the third test their resolve will have been severely tested by @entity0 and the @entity29 lower - order , though			1
@entity0 , shining as captain in place of the injured @entity32 , recorded his third straight hundred after resuming on 72 , and had @entity33 with him for company , with the veteran keeper making 55			0
@entity0 's seventh test hundred came in 191 balls but he was not to stop there , even when @entity33 left him as the only remaining recognised batsman , bottom - edging @entity40 behind			2
that brought @entity42 to the middle and he put up an entertaining 28 , going after 37 balls when @entity45 tempted him down the pitch and he was stumped by @entity47			0
@entity0 raises his bat to celebrate reaching his century during the third test against @entity3 @entity42 managed 28 off 37 balls before being stumped by @entity3 's @entity47 @entity51 was next in and the gnarled paceman offered some genuine surprise , going to a @entity50 best 74 from 88 balls			2
@entity51 clubbed eight fours and a six while out in the middle , providing real frustration for the visiting attack who , at that stage , would have been hoping to keep @entity2 to around 450			0
@entity45 eventually did for @entity51 , getting him playing across the line , and when @entity62 went to @entity63 for 11 all that remained was the question of whether @entity0 would get to a double hundred			0
@entity16 ( left ) connects with a shot on his way to an unbeaten 50 on day two of the third test the answer was no , the skipper cleaned up by @entity73 before heading off to a standing ovation after his 305 - ball vigil			1
he quickly had to switch to tactical mode as @entity3 started their reply , and it was he who pouched the only wicket of the innings , scooping up @entity82 for 28 off @entity51			0
after that @entity16 ( 55no ) and @entity83 ( 25no ) got to the close , although the latter was fortunate to see @entity33 put him down - albeit off a difficult chance off @entity87 - when on 12 .			0

@entity0 scored 192 before being *bowled* by @entity73
@entity3 ended the day on 108 for one after @entity16 's unbeaten 50
@entity2 are currently 2 - 0 up in the four @entity90 series
