the @entity0 have a saying about rematches : second time around is a rhubarb			0
mostly , they are right			0
@entity4 and @entity5 — @entity8 boxing ’s historic precursor to @entity9 at @entity10 on saturday night — came close to filling @entity11 , but that return bout fell as flat as a cowpat on a muddy field			1
ready to go : @entity16 and @entity17 ' rematch takes place at @entity10 this saturday occasionally , as with the @entity21 in @entity22 , our transatlantic cousins will grudgingly concede to a rematch being a ‘ barn - burner ’			1
@entity16 took part in one of those when he exacted revenge over @entity29 a year ago			1
the 80,000 ticket - buyers for @entity10 and the million projected to pay to watch on @entity31 will be comforted to know that the @entity32 expects this one to be even more thrilling			1
but for the most part , rematches are more bones of contention than nights of high drama			0
the public tend to clamour for second helpings and @entity9 roared as loudly as the fans for his chance of a second shot at @entity16 after his somewhat premature stoppage loss in november			1
@entity16 smiles wryly at being ordered by the @entity46 — whose world super-middleweight title he holds — to oblige his young challenger			1
the irony is not lost on him that @entity9 has insisted on deleting from the multi-million - pound contract a clause providing for a third fight in the event that he wins this time			1
@entity16 says : ‘ accidents can happen in the ring but it ’s interesting that @entity17 wo n’t offer me another rematch if he gets lucky			1
and while i ’m fighting him again he never gave a second chance to @entity60			0
’ not on : @entity9 was distraught after his first world title fight with @entity16 was stopped in @entity62 last year that is a reference to the @entity66 super-middleweight title fight in 2010 to which @entity60 came as a late substitute with a few days ’ training			1
@entity60 shocked @entity9 with an early knockdown before being stopped in the sixth round			0
his calls for a rematch with time to prepare went unheeded			2
@entity73 can argue @entity60 lapsed into amphetamine use soon after			0
but that remains the only defeat on the @entity78 ’s 19 - fight record ; he has since won the @entity8 title			1
another fight between them would not have reached the magnitude that is gripping the nation this weekend			2
can @entity9 live up to expectations , equal or surpass the excitement of five months ago ? intense : both men are confident they will knock the other out at @entity10 both men believe so			1
@entity9 says : ‘ this will be a great fight , even if it is one @entity16 can not win in the end			1
i will knock him out in the third			0
’ @entity16 says : ‘ @entity17 is getting stopped			1
probably in the mid-to - late rounds but sooner if he tries to fulfil that early prediction			2
’ so , come sunday morning , to which will we be adding @entity97 or the @entity98 ? @entity99 @entity100 - october 9 , 1993 , @entity11 after @entity5 ’s stoppage of the @entity4 in the first fight , the world ’s boxing fans had to wait three years for the rematch			1
then they flocked to @entity11 – to be disappointed			0
only the 12th and last round lived up to the blood and thunder of the original – and only because both corners told their man they had to win it			0
it ended in an unsatisfactory draw			0
disappointing : the rematch between @entity4 and @entity5 finished with a draw in @entity62 @entity118 - @entity117 – may 21st 1966 , @entity119 our ‘ @entity121 had famously floored @entity122 at @entity10 three years earlier with his fabled left hook and only the bell had saved @entity125			1
@entity117 took more care in the rematch at @entity119 , waiting for @entity118 ’s fragile eyes to cut again , which inevitably they did			1
easier : @entity122 was prepared for the threat of @entity118 in the rematch at @entity119 in 1966 @entity132 11 – february 7 , 1997 , @entity133 our @entity134 had lost his world heavyweight title by a shock 2nd round ko to @entity132 but the @entity0 lost his mojo in the intervening two - and - a - half years before the rematch			1
in the midst of his battles with drug abuse , @entity132 appeared in no fit state to fight – and refused to do so in the fourth and fifth rounds , suffering a mental break - down and weeping profusely in the ring			1
the referee had no alternative but to call a halt in @entity132 ’ favour			0
comfortable : @entity151 was past his best ... the referee had to award the fight to @entity132 @entity154 – january 28 , 1974 , @entity157 , @entity156 ’ @entity155 had inflicted @entity117 ’s first defeat in the @entity159 four years earlier			1
the first re-match in their trilogy was a let - down as @entity117 manoeuvred his way to a staid decision			1
@entity166 11 – march 16th 1996 , @entity167 , @entity133 our @entity168 had rocked @entity166 with a huge left in the second round of their first fight seven years earlier , before being stopped in the fifth			2
but @entity175 had come raging out of prison before the rematch and our @entity166 had to go back to @entity133 to defend his world heavyweight title against @entity179 on @entity180			2
sadly , a declining @entity166 was not up to the task , in what proved to be his last fight			2
he genuflected more than 30 times on his way to the ring , visibly in a state of nervous apprehension , and subsided against the ropes in the third round			0
declining force : @entity192 was not up to the task against @entity166 in the 1996 rematch in @entity133 @entity195 @entity196 – october 1st , 1975 , @entity197 , @entity198 although the first rematch disappointed , the second was an epic			2
promoter @entity202 ’s @entity21 in @entity198 was fought by these bitter foes as if it really was a war			0
after 14 rounds of extraordinary courage and punishment @entity206 ’ @entity155 was retired on his stool by trainer @entity209			0
it materialised that @entity125 was about to be pulled out by his trainer @entity211 and @entity117 said : ‘ this is the closest to death i have ever been			1
’ that 's more like it : @entity117 said it was the closest to death he had ever been after the @entity21 in @entity198 with @entity219 @entity220 – november 6th 1993 , @entity221 , @entity133 @entity222 had won a thunderous first fight , including an unbelievable 10th round which is acclaimed as the greatest three minutes in ring history			1
@entity227 @entity226 reclaimed the world heavyweight title a year later in the open - air stadium temporarily erected on the car park at @entity221			2
if anything the second bout in their trilogy was even more thrilling and this was rematch of two halves			2
@entity236 again had the best of the early rounds but the fight had to be stopped midway through the seventh round as a para-glider calling himself @entity243 crash - landed in the ring			1
@entity226 came back the stronger after a 21 minute delay to claim an epic decision			0
@entity247 : there was a 21 - minute delay in the rematch between @entity226 and @entity236 @entity251 – june 12 1989 , @entity221 , @entity133 @entity252 had retired since stopping the hitman eight years earlier , in the 14th round after being told by trainer @entity211 he was about ‘ to blow ’ the world welterweight title			1
@entity256 had come back to win the super-middleweight title			0
the championship distance had been reduced to 12 rounds and another phenomenal fight was declared a draw			2
uproar greeted the decision and years later @entity252 sportingly told @entity264 : ‘ you won that fight			2
’ @entity267 - february 5 , 1943 , @entity268 @entity252 versus the @entity269 has to be the greatest of all ring rivalries			2
having won their first fight a year earlier , @entity271 found himself in an even bigger war in their first re-match			2
probably the most gifted boxer in history , @entity252 was knocked through the ropes as his skills failed to fend off @entity281 through a long pounding			0
after their sixth and last fight @entity281 said : ‘ i fought @entity286 so often i almost got diabetes			0
’ @entity288 – 23nd november 2002 and june 7th 2003 , @entity289 and @entity290 @entity292 @entity291 and @entity293 fought three times between may 2002 and june 2003			0
every one was a barn - burner			1
the first and third were voted @entity299 by @entity300 and the second would have been had it not taken place in the same year as the first			0
none were for world titles but no - one cared			0
@entity291 won a @entity308 first			0
in the second he got up from being floored to survive a pounding but lose the 10 - round decision			0
the third saw @entity293 flattened , just beat the count and saved by the bell before recovering to win			0
after each fight both were taken to hospital			0
incredible : @entity319 and @entity291 served up some thrilling matches in the 21st century incredible : @entity319 and @entity291 served up some thrilling matches in the 21st century			0
