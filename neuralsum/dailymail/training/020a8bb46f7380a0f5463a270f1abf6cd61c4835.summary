by @entity0 by time up the sighs of relief from the @entity4 directors box very nearly drowned out the howls of outrage and anger from their @entity9 counterparts			2
almost , but not quite			2
@entity4 will wake on thursday morning to learn if @entity10 have been judged to be the victims of an over-officious @entity13 injustice			2
there was no right of appeal for @entity9 on wednesday night			2
no way of reversing the two significant penalty calls from referee @entity19 which saw @entity21 ’s first competitive domestic game end in a comfortable victory			1
breakthrough : @entity24 rounds @entity25 to give @entity4 the lead at @entity9 @entity9 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity25 5 ; @entity27 6 , @entity28 5 , @entity29 6 ; @entity30 6 , @entity31 6 , @entity32 5 ( @entity33 78 ) , @entity34 5 ( @entity35 59 ) , @entity36 5 ( @entity37 45 ) ; @entity38 5			1
subs not used : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43			2
booked : @entity27 , @entity37			1
@entity4 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity44 7 ; @entity45 6 , @entity46 6 , @entity47 6 , @entity48 6 ; @entity49 6 , @entity50 6 ; @entity51 7 ( @entity52 57 ) , @entity53 6 ; commons 5 ( @entity55 67 ) , @entity24 6 ( @entity56 73 )			2
subs not used : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61			2
man of the match : @entity51 a week after finding himself in the eye of a storm for red carding @entity69 player @entity68 at @entity70 , @entity19 was in the spotlight once more			1
if referees really are looking for a pay rise , this is the kind of game unlikely to help their cause much			1
it all hinged on six minutes and two key incidents involving @entity79 skipper @entity27			1
the first saw the right - back race the length of the field to remonstrate after the raised boot of @entity85 appeared to make clear contact in the @entity4 penalty area			1
no penalty , said the referee			1
on the touchline @entity41 writhed and gyrated , incensed with the verdict			2
his mood was scarcely aided by the spot kick given at the other end five minutes later			2
it was , in truth , a horrible decision			2
@entity52 has n’t done much to enhance his reputation in @entity99 football			2
his exaggerated tumble as he tried to wriggle clear of @entity27 in the @entity9 area is unlikely to improve the situation			1
@entity27 – already booked – was shown an instant red card for an alleged infringement			1
yet the @entity105 appeared to throw himself to the ground a full step after any semblance of contact , such as it was			2
the dismissal added insult to substantial injury			1
already a goal down to an @entity24 opportunist finish in 55 minutes , @entity9 were done for			0
controversy : referee @entity19 shows a red card to @entity9 's @entity27 ( left ) @entity49 struck the penalty kick calmly into the net for his first @entity4 goal			1
the third , a squirming low shot from @entity53 which wriggled horribly past @entity25 in 84 minutes , even though he got his hands to it , only compounded the @entity9 anguish			0
the home support left at the end muttering their claims of @entity4 cheating			0
the away support were diverted – however briefly – from their state of simmering discontent over @entity4 ’s transfer spend			0
seventy two hours before @entity135 unfurls the league flag there was a @entity139 sense of déjà vu as a banner in the @entity4 support read : ‘ @entity143 , sack the board			0
’ it was gone by time up			0
as was the @entity148 assistant coach who travelled to @entity149 in expectation of hosting @entity4 next wednesday night			0
his report will surely speak of a scoreline flattering the champions slightly			0
in truth @entity4 rarely have it easy in @entity149 , winning just one of their last four visits on league business			0
clinical : @entity49 struck his penalty kick calmly into the net for his first @entity4 goal the injured @entity164 was missing , while @entity165 ’s on loan defender @entity61 started on the bench			1
the opening 45 minutes demonstrated why @entity21 ’s next priority is to sign a striker			1
@entity169 – a player who might be the best option in the current impoverished circumstances – was axed from the squad completely			0
that , you sense , is a developing story			0
@entity175 partnered @entity176 up front once more in a conventional 4 - 4 - 2 – a departure from @entity21 ’s preferred 4 - 2 - 3 - 1			1
not for the first time the @entity178 frustrated the life out of his supporters in the first half before delivering the goal which changed the game with an opportunist finish			1
the goal was well - timed			0
without @entity188 , the talisman sold to @entity189 wednesday , @entity9 had their best spell at the start of the second half			0
the first period had been a non event			0
@entity51 had a bright 45 minutes on his first start for some time , but limped off in increasingly characteristic fashion in 57 minutes for @entity52 , a critical change			0
howler : @entity9 keeper @entity25 ( centre ) fumbles a shot from @entity53 for third goal aside from @entity51 , a competitive start for @entity44 marked the only other bright spot of the opening 45 for @entity21			1
the former @entity206 keeper might soon be the current @entity207 if he stays fit			0
replacing @entity208 he looked assured and confident , producing the only save of note in a pretty dreadful opening period when he pushed away @entity38 ’s 20 yard drive in the 22nd minute			0
@entity51 was a bundle of energy , adding more balance and width to @entity4 ’s play			0
he played a terrific one - two with @entity176 in 15 minutes and cut inside before striking a disappointing left foot low drive			0
but @entity4 ’s next chance came a full 23 minutes later , @entity24 fouled on the edge of the box by @entity27 and striking the free kick narrowly wide himself			1
within five minutes of the restart @entity79 came close to taking the lead when @entity34 retrieved @entity227 ’s inviting ball across goal and cut inside , his driven angled shot almost turned into goal by @entity38 from close range			1
delight : @entity4 manager @entity21 salutes travelling fans after first league victory @entity4 , it seemed , were on the back foot			1
@entity9 were knocking on the door			0
yet that changed completely when @entity28 dallied in possession in his own final third and was dispossessed by a pressing commons			0
@entity24 collected , kept his cool and rounded @entity25 to slot an angled low shot into the net for 1 - 0			0
@entity53 almost added another seconds later , taking a ricocheted @entity46 cross and thumping just wide			1
but only after the penalty incidents which defined this game			1
the @entity27 claim after the raised boot by @entity47			1
the @entity251 flashpoint which left @entity9 flushed and fuming			0
at 2 - 0 it was n’t over yet			0
@entity53 ’s useful knack of scoring goals continued when his low shot at the end of a neat passing move slipped and squirmed and evaded @entity25 for 3 - 0			0
the @entity4 youngster could have had another moments later but the champions – and @entity21 – had the win they craved at the end of a difficult fortnight .			1

@entity21 's first competitive domestic game ended in comfortable victory
referee @entity19 at centre of two controversial penalty decisions
dismissal of @entity79 skipper @entity27 added insult to injury
