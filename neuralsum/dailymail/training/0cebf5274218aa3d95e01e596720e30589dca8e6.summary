by @entity0 for hospital patients , the nights are often the loneliest , bleakest time			2
for @entity5 , the night after surgeons found a worrying ‘ abnormality ’ was possibly the worst of her life			1
@entity5 , then 25 and a mother of two , had undergone routine surgery to repair a prolapsed womb — but during the operation , surgeons had spotted a growth near her bladder that needed to be removed as soon as possible			1
‘ i ’d gone into hospital to have a routine op and now there was this “ abnormality ” — i was petrified it was cancer , ’ recalls @entity5			1
exceptional : nurse @entity25 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) her anxiety was understandable — over the previous ten years the receptionist from @entity28 had suffered more than 300 kidney infections , with no obvious cause			1
despite her anguish , ‘ not a single nurse or doctor came to see me that night to explain what was going on ’ , says @entity5			1
‘ my husband , @entity36 , had left because visiting hours were over and i just felt so scared and alone			0
i spent the night crying my eyes out — i even phoned my mum at 3am , begging her to come and get me			2
she rang the nurses ’ station and that was the only time a nurse came to see me			2
‘ i was really distressed , yet the nurse basically told me off and almost pushed me back to bed			2
’ the next morning a young nurse starting her shift caught sight of a clearly distraught @entity5			1
‘ she appeared by my bed like some kind of angel , ’ she recalls			0
‘ she was just so comforting , asking me what was wrong , and reassuring me she would sort everything out			0
she had n’t even taken off her coat , but started looking over my notes and explained what had happened during the operation			2
she also arranged for the surgeon to come and see me			0
‘ and , despite having other patients to see to , this nurse was by my bed , on and off , for ages — even through her lunch break			2
she made me believe everything would be all right			0
’ the nurse was @entity25			1
over the next ten months , @entity5 was admitted to hospital nearly 20 times , but the dedicated care she received from 24 - year - old @entity25 helped her through this			1
that ’s why @entity5 is nominating @entity25 for the @entity73 awards			1
‘ it ’s not just her empathy that makes @entity25 stand out , ’ says @entity5			1
‘ she goes out of her way to care , anticipating what you might want , how you might feel			0
‘ she ’d come to check on you just to see how you were			0
the other nurses did the medical things , but did n’t really speak to us ; she did both			0
when she was on the ward , everyone cheered up and felt better			0
‘ i was the youngest patient by far , and with the older patients , @entity25 would make sure they ’d eaten properly , cutting their food up for them , or feeding them , to keep their strength up			1
‘ she ’d search out fortified drinks for those who could n’t eat , bringing back a selection of flavours , rather than just making them have what she ’d chosen			0
she ’d find chairs for relatives to sit on			0
' it 's not just her empathy that makes @entity25 ( pictured left ) stand out , ' says @entity5 ( right )			1
' she goes out of her way to care , anticipating what you might want , how you might feel			0
' ' i just do what i can to try to bring something positive to whatever it is that my patients are going through			0
that 's what we have to do as nurses ' explains @entity25 ( pictured ) ‘ she would also stay after her shift had finished to make sure her patients were ok			1
she even came in on her day off to check on me			2
she made such a difference			0
‘ before i met @entity25 , my faith in the @entity113 was non-existent — she restored it			1
’ two days after her operation , @entity5 was discharged from the @entity116 in @entity28 , facing the prospect of another operation to investigate and remove the ‘ abnormality ’ once she ’d recovered properly			1
adding to her worries was the news that the catheter which had been inserted to drain urine from her bladder would have to remain for the foreseeable future			0
‘ i was already anxious about my next operation , and now i felt so humiliated that i was going to be hooked indefinitely to a bag — i was only 25			1
’ it was @entity25 who was there to comfort her and explain			1
two days later , on christmas eve , @entity5 was rushed back into hospital in agonising pain , caused by a blockage in the catheter			1
she spent @entity135 not at home with her husband and their two sons , @entity140 , now five , and @entity141 , four , but in hospital			2
‘ even though i felt so ill , i was miserable about not being at home			0
but @entity25 spent as much time with me as she could			1
‘ and when the children were allowed a brief visit , she made balloon animals out of surgical gloves , drew pictures on napkins and played games with the cardboard sick bowls			0
she tried so hard to make us all feel better			0
’ @entity5 is now is nominating nurse @entity25 for the @entity73 awards @entity5 returned to hospital last february to have investigative surgery — this revealed that her ‘ abnormality ’ was actually a 5cm cyst			1
that was the good news			0
‘ when i woke up from the operation , i was racked with pain , ’ she says			2
‘ but what made things worse was i ’d been led to believe the growth had been the cause of all my problems and i would n’t need a catheter any more			2
‘ but it was still there and i was told it might have to stay for good because of the damage to my urethra			0
‘ i felt utterly wretched			0
but as soon as i got back to the ward , @entity25 was there , reassuring me , talking me through everything			1
’ @entity5 had to undergo two more investigative operations , and each time , she says , she was overwhelmed by @entity25 ’s unstinting care and devotion			1
‘ once she came to see me on the day she was off work and going on holiday , saying she just wanted me to know that she was always there for me , ’ @entity5 says			1
matron @entity184 , who works alongside @entity25 at the @entity116 , says her colleague ‘ deserves both the plaudits and the nomination of health hero ’			1
‘ @entity25 goes above and beyond to make sure her patients always come first			1
many times i ’ve seen her work through her break or stay late because she wants to make sure she can personally see that everything is done for a particular patient , ’ she adds			0
' once she [ @entity25 , pictured right ] came to see me on the day she was off work and going on holiday , saying she just wanted me to know that she was always there for me , ' @entity5 ( left ) says ‘ there are a lot of good nurses , but @entity25 nurses as much with her heart as with the practical skills and knowledge she has learned			1
she ’s an exceptional nurse and a credit to the profession			2
’ @entity25 says : ‘ nursing is easy because it ’s something i feel so passionately about			1
’ she puts it down to the death of her 14 - year - old cousin in a motorbike accident when she herself was a teenager			0
‘ i spent a lot of time with my aunt , his mother			0
i saw how she struggled to come to terms with what had happened , and i felt i needed to do something with my life to help other people when they were having such difficulties			0
’ ‘ i just do what i can to try to bring something positive to whatever it is that my patients are going through			0
that ’s what we have to do as nurses			0
’ moved by her example , in january @entity5 quit her job as a receptionist at a gym to work with elderly and vulnerable people			2
‘ i was so inspired by watching the way @entity25 cared for others and the difference she made , ’ explains @entity5 , now 26			1
‘ i wanted to be able to do for others what she had done for me			0
everything i do in my new job — whether it ’s explaining things carefully to frightened elderly people or giving what comfort i can — is down to watching @entity25 at work			2
‘ @entity25 ’s an exceptional person who genuinely cares about your health			2
and she ’s helped me deal with whatever my fate may be			0
