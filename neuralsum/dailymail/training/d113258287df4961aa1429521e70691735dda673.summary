when @entity24 , who suffers from type 2 diabetes was interviewed by police , it emerged she may have been rendered totally incapable to drive due to a lack of blood sugar			1
she suffered from autonomic neuropathy which meant she did not have the warning signals to suggest that she was going to have a hypoglycaemic attack and paramedics did not check her blood levels at the time			2
inquiries also revealed the @entity41 automatic she had been driving was a courtesy car given to her on loan after she was involved in another road accident nine days earlier			1
she told @entity45 that she had slowed down as she approached the roundabout ' as i generally do '			0

however , after the sentencing , mrs @entity71 's husband @entity70 , 60 , a truck driver said : ' the sentence is ridiculous and she 's not even been financially burdened			1
' this medical condition she had has got her away scot - free and she has got off very lightly in my opinion			2
' a community order for a life , for killing a mother and wife , to me is totally wrong			1
i do n't think she realises what she has done			0
' ' she could have said something to us at court but she just let us walk past			0
that 's the hardest bite , her not showing any remorse			2
truck driver , @entity90 , 60 , whose wife @entity91 was killed in the accident , said the sentence is ' ridiculous ' ' she did n't even drop her head and start crying , when she came out i think she wanted to smile ' he added : ' @entity91 was the best mother and wife and my soulmate and the first thing i do when i walk through the door is look straight at the photo of her and say " i hope you are in a better place "			1
' if i could i would buy her back but i 'm never going to get her back			0

' a joint victim statements from mrs @entity71 's sons @entity109 and @entity112 said : ' life can never be the same again and it is not something we will ever get over , hopefully somehow we will learn to cope without mum			0

' passing sentence judge @entity120 told @entity24 : ' i make it plain if it were not for the medical condition that you are suffering , a sentence of imprisonment would be appropriate			1
' @entity126 wishes that they could turn the clock back and so undo the terrible tragedy that happened but that is not possible			0
arriving a court , @entity0 ( left ) and @entity131 ( right ) ahead of her sentencing at @entity45 ' one family has lost a wife and mother through no fault of their own			1
another a mother and grandmother held responsible for the events of that day			0
' no sentence can ever compensate for a life lost and no life lost can ever be measured in terms of a sentence whether in prison or not			2
' the sole cause of this fatal accident was the careless driving			2
there was no good reason why she should not have seen the truck in time but failed to do so			0
instead she accelerated to try and get ahead of it and in doing so lost control of the vehicle			1
' ' this unfortunate tragedy may well have been caused by a hypoglycaemic episode , she was unaware she had had at the time			1
' the accident , which happened on february 12 , 2013 , was nine days after another crash where @entity24 ' overshot ' a give way marking and collided with a car whilst on her way to see her daughter			1
there were injuries but her own car was damaged and she was given the automatic @entity41 as a courtesy car			2
witnesses to the tragedy said in the moments before the fatal impact @entity24 was involved in near miss at another mini roundabout where she failed to give way forcing a driver to slam on the brakes			1
motorist , @entity186 , said : ' she was just staring straight ahead did not make an eye contact - it was like the roundabout was n't there			0
' a judge at @entity45 found @entity24 guilty and handed her a community order and a driving ban he then followed her only to see disaster strike at a second roundabout further down the road			1
a 32 tonne tipper truck driver had to brake and sound his horn as @entity24 drove across in front of him			2
she was then seen to ' put her head down ' before her @entity41 suddenly accelerated and swerved onto the pavement where mrs @entity71 had no chance to get out of the way			0
@entity24 initially tried to claim another vehicle had crashed into the right - hand side of her car and knocked her across on to the pavement - but a thorough examination of the @entity41 did not show any evidence it had been hit on the side			1
the wagon , which had to brake hard as @entity24 drove in front of it , had no damage either - and none of four independent witnesses to the accident saw any contact			1
it is thought mrs @entity71 's dog returned home of its own accord after the accident			0
in mitigation defence counsel miss @entity228 said : ' had she known she was suffering from this condition she simply would not have been driving			2
' she expresses her remorse and sorrow for what happened			0
