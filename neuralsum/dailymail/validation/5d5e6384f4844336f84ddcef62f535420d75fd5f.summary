' from the perspective simply of the need for more infrastructure spending , there 's no doubt that from our perspective , we welcome the entry of the @entity30 , ' he said			0
' as the @entity2 just announced today in their statement , they were very clear in saying that they were going to insist that the standards of any new bank that they are part of would be equal to the @entity10 and the @entity271 , ' @entity249 added			2
