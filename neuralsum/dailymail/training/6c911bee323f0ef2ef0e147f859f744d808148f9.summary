@entity10 has posed for a picture of his old cast - mates from @entity13 , the wildly popular sitcom that launched his acting career			1

of course there are a few more grey hairs and wrinkles on display than during their 90s heyday			0
on the whole however , everyone was looking remarkably well preserved , the @entity13 followed the adventures of a fictionalised version of @entity10 himself			0
after getting into trouble with a local gang his mother decides to send him to stay with her wealthy and successful sister in the posh @entity13 area of @entity84			0
it was notable for @entity10 's often eccentric choices of early 90s clothing , with the rapper displaying a particular fondness for dayglo pinks			0
