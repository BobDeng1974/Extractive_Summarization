@entity0 , a former computer programmer for @entity1 who was convicted in march of aiding his boss ' massive @entity3 , got support from a noteworthy source this week : @entity1 himself			1
in an email filed in @entity9 federal court by @entity0 's defense lawyers , @entity1 described a meeting in which he said he told @entity0 and another programmer , @entity12 , that the trading at his firm was legitimate			1
' they ( asked ) if i was buying the securities that they showed on the reports , ' @entity1 wrote from his @entity21 prison , where he is serving a 150 - year sentence			1
' i answered , ' of course ' and explained that i had trading and custodial arrangements with all the major investment banks in @entity26 and the @entity27 who traded with us every day			0
' @entity0 is one of five @entity31 workers convicted in march of conspiracy to defraud clients , securities fraud and falsifying records			1
he â€™ll be sentenced next month , and his lawyers said the @entity1 emails might sway the judge toward leniency @entity1 's email also attempted to excuse @entity12			1
the email @entity1 sent to one of the defense lawyers claimed that the pair really did n't know what was happening in the filing , the lawyers argued that @entity1 's description of the meeting undermined the government 's thesis that @entity0 and @entity12 were aware the reports they were creating for outside auditors were based on fake trades			1
the two programmers were found guilty on all counts in march along with three other former madoff employees - back office director @entity58 and portfolio managers @entity59 and @entity61 - following a nearly six - month trial			0
prosecutors have asked for more than 20 years in prison for @entity65 and @entity59 , more than 14 years for @entity66 and more than eight years for @entity0 and @entity12			2
according to the email correspondence , @entity1 reached out to the defense lawyers and offered to provide information that might help their cases			2
' i assure you that my info in each of you clients ( sic ) cases is of great value and discredits the testimony provided by @entity78 , ' he wrote on sept. 29 in an email with several typographical errors , referring to the government 's star witness and his former deputy , @entity83			0
at trial , @entity83 testified about the meeting involving @entity1 , @entity0 and @entity12 that took place in september 2006			1
since @entity1 's fall , when he finally pled guilty to pocketing nearly $ 20 billion from his investors , many have been caught in the wake			2
not only are his employees facing serious jail time , but his family has been shattered according to @entity83 , the two programmers confronted @entity1 after expressing concerns they had given fake data to government regulators			2
@entity83 claimed the men refused to continue creating data reports and demanded additional pay , including a suggestion that they be paid in diamonds			0
lawyers for the two men have disputed that account , saying their clients had legitimate concerns and that they accepted @entity1 's explanation during the meeting			1
' in our view , the government 's arguments in this regard have no support in the record and are based on sheer speculation , ' wrote @entity117 , a lawyer for @entity0 , in the court filing			0
federal prosecutors have not yet filed a response			0
a spokeswoman for the office of @entity9 @entity27 attorney @entity123 declined to comment			0

lawyers for @entity0 are *hoping* that emails from @entity1 will sway a judge to be lenient on their client
*due* to be sentenced next month on charges of conspiracy to defraud clients , securities fraud and falsifying records .
