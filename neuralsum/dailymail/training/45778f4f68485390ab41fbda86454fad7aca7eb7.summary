one is a toddler who desperately needed an operation to walk , the other an aspiring topless model who wanted a ‘ boob job ’ to look more like @entity4			2
and there are no prizes for guessing which case the @entity9 deemed the more urgent			2
the health service was yesterday accused of showing a ‘ skewed sense of priorities ’ after it emerged that @entity12 , a two - year - old boy with cerebral palsy , has been turned down for funding for an operation which could allow him to walk			1
priorities : @entity20 , left , was refused funding for an operation which could help him walk while aspiring model @entity23 , right , had her breasts enlarged to 36dd at a cost of £ 4,800 to taxpayers yet just a few miles away , 22 - year - old @entity28 has been given size 36dd breasts at taxpayers ’ expense because she convinced doctors her flat chest was ‘ ruining her life ’			1
the two cases from @entity38 have emerged after @entity12 ’s mother spoke out about how he has been denied the potentially life - changing procedure			1
the toddler , who relies on a frame to move around , can have the operation only if his single mother @entity44 can raise £ 25,000 to have it performed privately			1
miss @entity46 , 30 , said : ‘ @entity12 has splints on his legs , a flexi - stand as he has n’t got any balance , and uses a walking frame to get around			1
‘ he wants to be jumping in muddy puddles like @entity53			0
he wants to be kicking a football and he ca n’t jump on a trampoline			0
i ’d love to see him walking unaided for his first day at primary school			0
‘ i ’m a single parent and i do n’t have that kind of money			0
even if they look again at the decision , there ’s going to be a big backlog of children like @entity12 waiting to have this done			2
’ turned down : @entity12 , who has cerebral palsy , with mother @entity44 , needs a metal frame to walk @entity12 , who lives with his mother in @entity68 , was referred for surgery at @entity70 , which specialises in the procedure , known as selective dorsal rhizotomy			1
but when a surgeon applied to @entity74 for funding , he was turned down because the procedure is not yet routinely covered by the health service			2
the case seems particularly cruel when compared to that of @entity80 , who had a breast enlargement on the @entity9 at nearby @entity82 , which is also part of the @entity84			1
under @entity9 guidelines , cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances when a local trust deems it is needed ‘ to protect a person ’s health ’			1
outrage : @entity46 , whose son @entity12 , two , needs a specialist operation in order to walk without a frame , slammed the @entity9 for refusing to pay for the operation but miss @entity28 , who works in telesales , convinced doctors that having a flat chest was causing her emotional distress			1
after funding was recommended by her gp and approved by her local primary care trust , she had a £ 4,800 operation , increasing the size of her breasts from @entity106 to @entity107			2
she now says she has the ‘ confidence ’ to pursue her dream of topless modelling and hopes to emulate former page 3 girl @entity4 , also known as @entity4			0
the unmarried mother from @entity38 plans to leave her children , @entity113 , five , and @entity114 , two , with her parents while she chases her dream			0
she wrote on @entity117 : ‘ i have no regrets			0
my body is the start of my new life			0
’ @entity122 , chief executive of the @entity123 ’ @entity124 , said : ‘ taxpayers will be stupefied that the same system which funded a boob job for an aspiring glamour model will not allow treatment that would enable a little boy to walk unaided			0
‘ it certainly suggests that the @entity9 has a skewed sense of priorities			1
’ a spokesman for @entity74 said funding was granted for the operation recommended for @entity12 in only ‘ exceptional cases ’ , adding that proposals are being considered to offer it more widely later in the year			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity141 said : ‘ any treatment provided by the @entity9 needs to be clinically justified , but the local @entity9 is best placed to make these decisions			2
’ meanwhile , @entity44 is determined to fund the operation for her son herself and has launched her own charity page at justgiving.com / oliverwantstojoinin cosmetic procedures are not normally done on the @entity9 unless doctors decide there is a clinical need			1
this decision is taken at a local level , by local clinical commissioners under the new @entity9 reform , on the basis of reports submitted by a patient 's doctors			2
commissioners set their own criteria according to what , in their view , are the health needs of the local community			0
for cosmetic surgery , the usual protocol is that the commissioners must decide there is some kind of clinical , ie health , need for the operation to be funded on the @entity9			1
simply wanting to look nicer in itself is not reason enough			0
@entity174 , also known as @entity9 @entity38 , offers a list of cosmetic procedures that may be available on its website			0
they include breast augmentation , breast reduction , eyelid surgery ( blepharoplasty ) , and rhytidectomy ( wrinkle removal including face lift )			0
it says these may be available ' providing certain criteria can be met ' , and lists the criteria			0
the criteria required for breast augmentation include suffering from certain rare syndromes , severe asymmetry ( more than two cup sizes difference ) , or lumpectomy that results in deformity			0
rare cases , however , such as ms @entity28 's , have to be go through the @entity199 process , in which each case is decided upon its individual merits			1

the operation on @entity12 , 2 , is not deemed worth of funding by @entity9 *bureaucrats*
model @entity28 's breast enlargement was deemed ' necessary for health reasons '
@entity214 's mother now raising money to have vital surgery done privately
@entity9 accused of having ' skewed sense of priorities '
@entity12 's mother is now raising £ *24,000* to give her son the gift of walking
