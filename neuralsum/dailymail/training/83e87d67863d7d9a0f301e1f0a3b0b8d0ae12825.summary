by @entity0 he might be celebrating his first birthday today but when it comes to style , @entity3 has the sort of selling power that far outstrips his years with even his mother , the @entity8 , left trailing in his wake			1
dubbed ' the world 's most influential toddler ' by @entity12 , anything the infant royal wears sells out instantly as mothers rush to add a shot of royal style to their children 's wardrobes			1
with a mother famous for her sartorial nous , @entity3 was always going to have a stylish wardrobe			1
but what few could have imagined is just how quickly the ' @entity24 ' would kick in			0
they have since sold out adorable : @entity3 's @entity33 ( left , beneath cardigan ) and his @entity36 shorts and t - shirt ( right ) all sold out within hours of being worn in the event , it took less than 48 hours with the white receiving blanket in which he was wrapped as he was carried from the @entity42 selling out almost instantly			1
costing £ 44.95 and made by @entity45 + @entity46 , a @entity48 label run by an @entity49 , more than 7000 @entity44 swaddling wraps were sold in the first nine days of @entity3 's life , while traffic to the brand 's website shot up by 1,960 per cent			1
and so it has continued , with the latest to benefit from the @entity3 effect being @entity56 , the @entity58 brand behind the striped sailcloth dungarees worn by the third in line to the throne for the birthday portrait released on sunday			1
costing just £ 27.50 , the all - in - one sold out within hours of the photograph 's publication with a £ 31.50 red version also selling well - much to the delight of ceo @entity69			1
' @entity56 is extremely honoured that the @entity71 and @entity8 chose our brand to dress @entity3 for this official photo , ' he told @entity75			1
starting early : @entity45 + @entity46 sold more than 7,000 white receiving blankets in the first nine days of @entity3 's life after the baby was carried from the @entity42 in one ca n't copy this one : one of the few outfits not to sell out , if only because it is unique , @entity3 's @entity80 style lace christening gown did spark a wave of imitations 174280 71145 37920 137602 69101 26820 97455 ' we are surprised and delighted and we could not imagine a better ambassador than this little boy full of life			1
we take this opportunity to wish him a very happy birthday			2
' and @entity92 is n't the only ceo to have been left rubbing his hands in glee following a royal appearance			2
designer @entity36 , almost unheard of until @entity3 wore her sailboat smocked dungarees for a ' crawl - about ' in @entity99 , says that the @entity24 has transformed her business			1
' he is such a high profile baby and he ’s brought lots of attention and excitement to the brand , ' the @entity102 - based designer said in an interview with @entity12			2
' it ’s been phenomenal for the business to have @entity3 wearing pieces from the collection			2
personally , as a @entity117 citizen , if there ’s one child i ’d want to dress it ’s the heir to the throne			0
' others to benefit include little known @entity122 label , @entity123 whose white romper suit emblazoned with sailboats was worn as @entity3 arrived in @entity49 , and @entity128 's @entity127 whose website crashed after the baby royal was photographed in its pinstriped dungarees during a day out at the polo			1
' @entity3 wore the sailboat romper by @entity133 on two occasions , at the @entity71 arrival in @entity99 ( with a white cardigan ) and in @entity49 , ' remembers @entity123 founder , @entity137			2
popular : this @entity138 of @entity140 cashmere jumper worn in march 's @entity142 portrait was a gift from @entity3 's doting grandfather , prince @entity144 adorable : this pair of £ 33.99 @entity147 dungarees sold out within hours of being spotted on @entity3 at a polo match and even crashed the brand 's website ' it was a great surprise and honour to see it worn by @entity3			1
we had a significant increase in sales afterwards and people emailed us from all over the world to order the romper			0
' and it is n't just @entity123 sales figures that have felt the @entity3 effect			2
as ms @entity137 explains , the increased scrutiny has resulted in a makeover for the business itself. , ' we had the idea of developing our business by launching a web shop , ' she explains			0
' with all the publicity we received , we had to speed up setting the shop up			0
' it also motivates us for our future projects			0
now there are big expectations and people are following what we are doing			0
a fashion magazine even contacted us to photo shoot of our autumn winter collection ; this has been very encouraging for us			0
' most of all though , ms @entity137 says she is thrilled by the simple fact that the @entity8 liked her work enough to buy it for her baby son			0
' we are of course thrilled with such an honour and we have great admiration for the royals , ' she beams			0
' the fact that they liked our sailboat romper means a lot to us , regardless of whether the current sailboat romper frenzy continue or not			0
' we will always remember the moment we saw the little prince wearing our romper , and the excitement we felt			0
we feel great about the fact that @entity133 can dress little boys all over the world like little princes			0
' trendsetter : @entity3 's @entity147 dungarees were also worn in @entity200 ( left ) while this pair of @entity36 dungarees ( right ) were seen in @entity203 and dressing baby sons around the world is clearly popular - the young royal even has his own style blog , what @entity3 wore , dedicated to all things baby style			1
the blog even has a sister site in the shape of @entity213 wore - a website devoted to the @entity8 's wardrobe - although prince @entity216 is yet to find similar favour with the fashion set			2
but while the @entity8 might still be a dab hand at selling out whatever she wears , even she can not compete with her son when it comes to sheer selling power			0
from £ 44.95 swaddling wraps to sailcloth dungarees , the @entity3 effect shows no sign of petering out - much to the excitement of childrenswear designers contemplating another decade of buoyant sales to come .			1

@entity3 was less than 48 hours old when the ' @entity233 ' first kicked , selling out @entity45 + @entity235 blankets
since then , everything the *junior* royal has worn has sold out with designer @entity36 among those to benefit
the £ 27.50 sailcloth dungarees by @entity56 worn in sunday 's first birthday portrait have already sold out
@entity3 will celebrate his first birthday today with a family party at @entity247
