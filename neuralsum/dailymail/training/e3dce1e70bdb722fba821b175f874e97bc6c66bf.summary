by @entity1 reporter a woman dodged two speeding tickets by claiming her husband was driving , even though he had been dead for a year			1
former business owner @entity5 , 60 , got away with the deception until she applied for a passport in her husband ’s name and sent with it a photo of a man she met in @entity13			1
civil servants became concerned and alerted police who found @entity18 ’s husband @entity17 had died in 2007			1
jailed : @entity5 was handed a six - month jail term after claiming her dead husband was driving the car on both occasions when she was caught for speeding but @entity23 was told he had two speeding fines recorded against him in 2008 and six penalty points had been put on his driving licence			1
details of the speeding incidents were sent to her home in @entity31 , @entity32 and she replied saying her husband was the driver and paid the £ 60 fines			1
@entity34 , prosecuting , said : ' the @entity35 did n’t realise he had passed away until these matters were drawn to their attention			2
' somewhat bizarrely and for no apparent reason , this defendant later made an application for a @entity42 passport in the name of her late husband , who passed away in 2007			2
' the first application was made in 2011 but was returned to her			2
she then made a second one , again in the name of her late husband , and included the photograph of a man who has never been identified			0
she admitted two counts of perverting the course of justice and two of making fraudulent applications to get a passport			1
@entity58 , in mitigation , said she had no penalty points on her licence and so did not risk a ban because of the speeding tickets			1
he said : ' there would be an increase in insurance but this is clearly not the situation where somebody has nine points and gets a partner , grandfather or uncle to take the points so they avoid disqualification			0
' she was ' primary carer ' for her husband , who had cancer			0
when he died , she suffered from depression and discovered he was in debt			2
that resulted in ' loan sharks ' chasing her , mr @entity58 said			0
judge @entity84 told @entity18 her actions were ' callous ' , ' attacking the very fabric of the justice system ' ' there were debts with legitimate companies and loan sharks were also coming out of the woodwork			1
her husband had passed away and she had no one to turn to , ' he added			0
' she was not thinking clearly , not thinking as she would normally			0
she was not aware of the seriousness of what she has done			0
' the court heard @entity18 used to own a printing business and was a trained bookkeeper			1
after being widowed , she lived in @entity13 and was ordered by debt collectors to produce her husband ’s passport			0
she used a photograph of a man she met in @entity13			0
mr @entity58 said : ' she signed it to say it was a likeness of her husband			0
she gave her phone number and e-mail			0
' passing sentence judge @entity84 told @entity18 : ' it sounds quite callous what you did			2
perverting justice is attacking the very fabric of the justice system			1
