' his suggestion that “ voices told him to do it ” , were in our opinion completely fabricated			0
' @entity78 had decided to split up from @entity9 , but she was murdered before she had a chance to leave him			0
' we have had to live with the terrible consequence of @entity9 ’s murder of our daughter , the details of which have been both shocking and graphic			2
' at no stage has @entity9 shown any remorse whatsoever and his account of how he murdered @entity78 is quite the worst thing any parent could possibly imagine			0
