by @entity0 a 74 - year - old marathon runner believes a technical error is behind his apparently miraculous performance in the second half of the @entity5			1
veteran runner @entity6 set off on the grueling 26 - mile race shortly after 10am on sunday , april 13 , official race statistics show			1
he managed to reach the halfway point in a time of around three and a half hours , crossing the midway line at 1:28pm			1
@entity6 appears to have completed the second half of the @entity15 marathon in under half the time he took to complete the first half official photos show mr @entity6 crossing @entity18 ( right ) and making his way up the @entity21 in front of @entity23 ( left ) race records show mr @entity6 set off at 10am , reached the half way point at 1.30pm but had finished by 2.45pm but , according to race records , mr @entity6 then ran an incredible second half of the race , completing the last 13 miles in just one hour and 14 minutes			1
the time would not be out of place in an @entity32 marathon , with former @entity35 women 's champion @entity33 only seven minutes faster in her 2003 @entity37 run			0
mr @entity6 has denied he had cheated and insisted the extremely fast second half time must be down to a technical problem			2
he told @entity40 : ' i do n't remember there being mats to record times			0
i ca n't explain it , but it 's not my fault			0
' mr @entity6 ( centre left ) crossed the finish line with a time of four hours , 39 minutes - but his second half performance would have been good enough to keep up with @entity33 his overall time of four hours , 39 minutes made him the 15,281st runner to cross the finishing line near @entity23 , the official website states			1
retired insurance broker mr @entity6 , of @entity57 , @entity58 , has run more than 30 marathons including @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 since taking up running in the 1980s			2
a member of @entity15 's @entity66 running club , he has even taken part in runs in the @entity69 , @entity70 and on @entity71			0
@entity73 - @entity72 was accused of cheating after , like mr @entity6 , his record only showed estimated times for 25km , 30km and 35km it comes after another runner , @entity73 - @entity72 , 34 , was accused of duping race officials after he completed the second leg of the marathon in just one hour , one minute - three minutes shy of the world record			1
it was alleged mr @entity83 - @entity72 jumped the barrier separating the 13 - mile marker from the 22 - mile point and hid in the crowds while runners looped round @entity89 and doubled back			0
like the online record for mr @entity83 - @entity72 ' run , mr @entity6 ' record only gives estimated times at the 25km , 30km and 35km markers â€“ suggesting he either missed out those checkpoints or that his chip failed to activate at those points			0
a spokesman for @entity5 has said they are investigating ' a number of discrepancies ' in runners ' times .			2
