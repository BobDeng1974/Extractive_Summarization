passengers flying into , or out of @entity1 , will now be able to use portable electronics including phones and tablets at any time during their flights			1
starting immediately , @entity1 - based airlines can , at their own discretion , allow passengers to leave electronics on throughout the entire flight , without putting them into @entity11			1
but , airlines will need to certify their planes are n't affected by transmission signals before allowing devices to be used			1
the @entity16 in @entity17 has issued new guidelines			1
they state that passengers can use portable electronics , including phones and tablets , at any time during flights they will also need to equip their aircrafts with network connectors to make it possible to get online , for example			1
the statement was made by @entity28 - based @entity16 ( @entity16 )			2
spokesman @entity29 said the plans are a step beyond what 's allowed by the @entity33			2
earlier this year , @entity35 security officials introduced mandatory checks for electronic devices on flights			0
under the plans , passengers must be able to power on their phone or table			0
if they ca n't , then they either ca n't board the flight , or they have to hand over the gadget			0
in july , ministers in the @entity46 announced these checks on electronic devices would be expanded			0
checks will apply to passengers flying both in and out of @entity46			0
flights involved include those to and from the @entity53 and @entity54			0
however , reports claim @entity56 and @entity57 will fund the return of passengers ' confiscated devices			0
‘ we 're basically opening the door where , in theory , you 'll be able to continue making your phone call through the gate throughout the flight , like you would on a train			0
’ @entity56 already lets passengers on its business - class flights from @entity71 to @entity72 to use @entity73 and send texts , and is starting to relax the regulations on other flights as well			1
passengers are not allowed to make voice calls , both other @entity73 and through their network , to avoid annoying other passengers			1
in addition , there is no network signal at high altitudes			0
@entity16 's previous guidance , from last year , allowed electronic devices for almost the whole flight , so long as they were not transmitting any signals by being put into @entity11			1
similarly , the @entity33 lifted its own restrictions on the use of most personal electronic devices during takeoffs and landings			0
this does not include calls , which fall under the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) , and are prohibited			0
airlines will need to certify planes are n't affected by transmission signals			1
they will also need to equip craft with network connectors before the @entity33 's announcement in october , the agency had long barred the use of electronic devices below 10,000 feet ( 3,000 metres ) because of concern they could cause electronic interference with aircraft systems during landings , the phase of flight when accidents are most likely to occur			1
due to differences among fleets and operations , the agency said the implementation will vary among airlines , but the agency expects many carriers will prove to the @entity33 their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode , gate - to-gate , by the end of the year			2
the @entity33 based its decision on input from a group of experts that included representatives from the airlines , aviation manufacturers , passengers , pilots , flight attendants , and the mobile technology industry			2
@entity29 said the new guidance applies to any @entity1 - based carrier , no matter where the flight originates .			2

the @entity16 in @entity17 has issued new guidelines
they state that passengers can use portable electronics , including phones and tablets , at any time during flights
some airlines already allowed @entity73 to be used in flights , but the changes mean all flights in @entity1 can fly without the restrictions
guidelines are *effective* immediately , but airlines make the *ultimate* decision
airlines will need to certify planes are n't affected by transmission signals
they will also need to equip their aircrafts with network connectors
*people* will still be restricted from making calls to prevent annoying others
