by @entity0 published : 18:42 est , 16 march 2014 updated : 22:25 est , 16 march 2014 pledge : @entity2 has vowed to build 120,000 more homes by the end of the decade the controversial government - backed help to buy scheme is to be extended until the end of the decade and the first new garden city for 100 years is to be built in an attempt to boost housebuilding			1
chancellor @entity2 revealed yesterday that both measures will be in this week ’s @entity14 , adding that @entity15 needed to ‘ get building ’ to secure the economic recovery			1
the extension of @entity5 to buy for new properties – which had been due to end in 2016 – to 2020 will support the construction of 120,000 additional homes , he said			1
the move comes despite suggestions that the help to buy scheme could be overheating the housing market , with @entity28 governor @entity27 keeping a ‘ close eye ’ on the scheme			1
under help to buy , the government lends a prospective home buyer up to 20 per cent of the cost of their new - build home so a buyer needs only a 5 per cent cash deposit and a 75 per cent mortgage to make up the rest			2
the chancellor also announced that a garden city will be built at @entity43 in @entity44 , which will initially provide 15,000 homes			1
the chancellor said @entity15 needs to ' get building ' despite @entity27 warning the scheme is dangerous shadow chancellor @entity48 said : ‘ we ’ve got the lowest level of house - building since the 20s			1
‘ the government is not doing enough to invest in affordable homes and the economics of this is if you boost demand with help to buy and do n’t do enough on supply , the price goes up ( and ) it ’s harder to get into the housing market			2
‘ if @entity2 really wants to make a difference he would have been much more radical on house - building in the last three years and today – and he ’s not been			1
it ’s a damp squib			0
’ the @entity68 , which represents almost 400 councils in @entity70 and @entity71 , expressed alarm at the chancellor ’s plans			0
chairman sir @entity75 said : ‘ democratically accountable councils have been at the forefront of delivering local growth and the creation of a separate , remote quango is unnecessary			0
’ @entity48 yesterday dumped @entity82 ’s promises to cut vat and reverse child benefit cuts			0
the shadow chancellor confirmed that a £ 12billion plan at the centre of the opposition ’s ‘ plan for jobs and growth ’ – a reduction in vat to 17.5 per cent – had been abandoned			0
and a pledge to restore child benefit to the better - off could also no longer be a ‘ priority ’			0
instead @entity82 would use the proceeds of new taxes on banks and bankers ’ bonuses – which the @entity101 accuse them of spending ten times over on different projects – to fund a ‘ jobs guarantee ’ for the young unemployed			0
@entity48 blasted @entity2 's plans while revealing @entity82 will not prioritise reversing child benefit cuts mr @entity48 also again refused to apologise for @entity82 ’s economic record – denying the last government spent too much money			1
‘ there was a global financial crisis , ’ he said			0
‘ at that point , we had the lowest level of national debt of any big country and @entity2 , the @entity101 shadow chancellor , had matched @entity82 ’s level of public spending			2
‘ am i going to apologise for the level of public spending that @entity2 , @entity120 and @entity121 agreed on in 2007 ? absolutely not			2
’ @entity101 mp @entity122 said : ‘ it ’s the same old @entity82 – offering no economic plan , just more spending , more borrowing and more taxes			0

help to @entity130 will last until end of decade instead of ending in 2016
new garden city in @entity43 , @entity44 , will provide 15,000 more homes
@entity2 said @entity15 needs to ' get building ' despite warning from @entity27
