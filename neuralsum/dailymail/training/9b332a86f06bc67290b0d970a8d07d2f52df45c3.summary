@entity0 does not believe there is a problem with the intensity of @entity5 's training after @entity6 suggested they need to work harder			1
@entity6 made his comments in the wake of the @entity14 ' fortunate 2 - 1 @entity13 win in @entity15 , in which they required two goals in the final minutes to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat			1
that result came on the back of another disappointing home draw against @entity23 last saturday			1
@entity0 said : ' i do n't know what he meant by that			1
but you have to be careful with statements after the game			2
i think we train very hard , the attitude is right and the spirit is there			0
' we lost only two games ( in all competitions ) but we have not made enough points			0
' @entity6 had offered stinging criticism of both @entity5 's style of training and style of play following yet another poor performance in @entity50			1
the north @entity37 outfit are already 11 points off @entity53 in the @entity55 title race after drawing five of their opening eight matches			0
' we are not at our best , ' the @entity5 vice-captain said			1
' football-wise we lack a few things			0
we have to be honest to ourselves and train harder			0
' everyone knows that it is a difficult start to the season for us and confidence is not how we want it			0
@entity65 ( left , with @entity6 ) rescued a @entity13 victory with a last - minute winner but @entity5 are well off the title pace set by @entity53 after drawing against @entity23 last saturday ' i think we have to do better with our own possession , to put more pressure on them [ opponents ] , not to lose so many balls in the middle of the park , to play more in wide areas			1
' i think it is better to expose them there , instead of playing one - twos through the middle			2
it does n't work as much as last season , so we have to work on that			2
the passing game is not as efficient as last year			2
but all of a sudden we lose players week - by - week			2
' @entity0 indicated @entity88 will not be ready to play this weekend against @entity89 after a nine - month lay off with a serious knee injury			1
@entity88 is back in training with @entity5 but is not yet quite ready for a return to the first team he said : ' he has to get used to contact again			1
he has been out nine months , he needs to get used to being kicked again			0
he needs to feel completely confident but he is not far			0
fitness wise he is there			0
contact front he needs a bit more time			0
' @entity5 travel to the @entity99 hoping to take advantage of a team still in shock from the 8 - 0 hammering they received at @entity104 last week			1
but @entity0 warned his men to expect a fightback from @entity108 's side			1
' we expect commitment and fight for 90 minutes and we have to prepare for that , ' he said			0
' the result will have dropped their confidence and increased their resolve			0
