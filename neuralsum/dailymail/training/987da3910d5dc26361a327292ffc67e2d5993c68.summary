by @entity0 children are being targeted by junk food tv ads because companies like @entity4 and @entity5 have found a way around controls , claim health campaigners			1
in theory , foods high in sugar , fat and salt are banned from being advertised around programmes that are specifically for children			2
however , food companies have resorted to targeting programmes in family peak viewing time , such as @entity20 ’s @entity19 , @entity21 , @entity22 , and @entity23 , which have huge child audiences			1
children are being targeted by junk food tv ads because companies like @entity4 and @entity5 have found a way around controls , claim health campaigners in theory , foods high in sugar , fat and salt are banned from being advertised around programmes that are specifically for children now , doctors , the @entity35 , and the @entity36 are calling for controls on the advertising of unhealthy foods to be extended until the 9pm watershed			1
an analysis of over 750 adverts found almost one in four tv ads shown between 8pm and 9pm were for food			0
viewers were bombarded with as many as eleven junk food adverts per hour , according to a team of researchers from @entity52 ’s @entity51			2
within these food ads , the most frequently shown were unhealthy products from supermarkets such as @entity56 and @entity57 , followed by fast - food chains such as @entity4 and then chocolate and sweet companies like @entity61 and @entity5			1
figures show that children ’s tv viewing peaks around 8pm , but regulations created to protect them from targeted ads do not typically cover this time			0
an alliance of concerned organisations , action on @entity71 , which is headed by the @entity36 and the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) , commissioned the research to spur the government and broadcasting regulator @entity74 to take action			2
however , food companies have resorted to targeting programmes in family peak viewing time , such as @entity20 ¿ s @entity19 , @entity21 , @entity22 , and @entity23 , which have huge child audiences the researchers said the clips analysed seem designed for a young audience , with nearly a third of food adverts shown between 8pm - 9pm using themes of ‘ fun ’ rather than more adult concerns of price or convenience			1
over half of the clips – 53per cent - used children or child - aged characters to promote their food			0
around a third of ads studied ended with a website or @entity99 hashtag - a key way of reaching teenagers , as thirty six per cent of 8 - 15 year olds use smartphones or laptops ‘ most times ’ when watching tv			0
@entity107 , chief executive of the @entity35 , said : ‘ parents do n’t expect their children to be bombarded with ads for unhealthy food during primetime tv , but that ’s exactly what happens			1
‘ even when the show is over , junk food marketers could be reaching out to young people online			0
a lack of regulation means companies are free to lure kids into playing games and entering competitions – all with a view to pushing their product			0
‘ we want the government to protect children by switching off junk food adverts on tv until after 9pm and putting rules in place to stop children becoming fair game for internet marketing			1
’ @entity107 , chief executive of the @entity35 , said : ' parents do n't expect their children to be bombarded with ads for unhealthy food during primetime tv , but that 's exactly what happens ' professor @entity141 , of the @entity142 , said : ‘ currently junk food advertising on television is banned during children ’ s programming – but we know that millions of children are watching ‘ family friendly ’ programmes like the @entity21 and @entity20 ’s @entity19 later in the evening			1
‘ and we know that advertising to this age group at this time , works ; not only are children and young people easily influenced and parents worn down by pester power , but food companies would n’t spend huge amounts of money if it was n’t effective			2
‘ extending the ban to 9pm would not only have a positive effect in changing behaviours , but it would also send a clear message to the industry			0
' children should not be commercially exploited and the advertising industry must take some responsibility for helping tackle the growing problem of childhood obesity			0

health campaigners *criticised* junk food companies for targeting children
@entity4 and @entity5 are among the brands *condemned* for advertising during programmes like @entity21 and @entity20 's @entity19
doctors , the @entity35 and the @entity36 want ads for unhealthy foods to be banned before the 9pm watershed
