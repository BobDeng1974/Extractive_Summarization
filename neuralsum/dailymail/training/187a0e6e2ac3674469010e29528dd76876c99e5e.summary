australians have been warned of an increase in bushfires as a super hot summer is once again predicated across the country			0
temperatures are reportedly going to soar above average over summer 2014 - 15 , for the third year in a row and after 2013 marked the hottest year on record			1
the news comes as @entity10 scored its hottest two consecutive days on record on monday and tuesday , with temperatures reaching up to 35.5 degrees			1
dr @entity13 from the @entity14 told @entity15 : ' the next three months are likely to be above average ... and the above average temperatures will continue through both day and night			2
' dr @entity13 said the biggest changes will be felt in southern and eastern @entity20 and all the major capital cities and that the rise in temperatures is a continuation of what we have seen for the past three years			1
' @entity34 just had it 's second hottest september on record and @entity20 had its hottest day on record ... it 's not just @entity10 that has seen unusual conditions , ' dr @entity13 said			1
the rising temperatures this summer are reportedly due to warmer than normal ocean temperatures off the western and southern coastline combined with a developing @entity41 - a band of warm ocean water temperatures - in the @entity44			1
however , five separate studies this week blamed 2013 's heatwave on man - made climate change caused by carbon emissions			1
researchers from the @entity51 , the @entity52 and the @entity53 published their strong statement on the impact of climate change on @entity20 's weather patterns in the @entity58			1
dr @entity13 supports the recent findings and said ' that [ climate change ] signal in the background is not going away			1
in the last decade @entity20 has only seen one relatively cool year			2
' heatwaves are set to occur in @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 this severe weather season , according to the @entity70 report			0
meanwhile , @entity20 is predicted to experience an increasing number of bad bushfire weather days in its southern and eastern states			1
@entity10 scored its hottest two consecutive days on record on monday and tuesday , with temperatures reaching up to 35.5 degrees it will be the third year in a row @entity20 has experienced record temperatures the high temperatures this week were just a taste of what is to come over summer dr @entity81 , ceo of the @entity83 and @entity82 , told @entity15 : ' an underlying lack of rainfall across much of central and eastern @entity20 and in the south - west of the continent has increased the potential for bushfires in these areas over the coming season			1
' despite good rainfalls in recent weeks in some areas and large fires last season , many areas are still dry and largely unburnt			0
if this summer is again very hot and dry the conditions are set for a potentially bad bushfire season			1
' @entity99 commissioner @entity98 told the @entity100 this season would be worse than the last			0
' without being alarmists in anyway , we are being realistic based on the forecast and the underlying conditions , [ that this ] season is shaping up to be a difficult one , ' he said			0
the official bushfire seasons began on wednesday and a bushfire map , published this week by the @entity83 and @entity109 , shows the areas that have the potential for a fire to be more severe if it were to occur			2
an increase in bushfires has been predicted for this summer due to the above average temperatures the @entity117 map is used by fire authorities to make strategic decisions on resource planning for the upcoming fire season			2
the map shows the areas that have the potential for a fire to be more severe the map , which is used as a tool to help fire agencies prepare for bushfires , shows how fires could break out in many parts of the country			0
bushfire potential depends on many factors including weather and climate , fuel abundance and availability , recent fire history and firefighting resources available in an area			2
the @entity83 and @entity109 's september reports says that rainfall since may has been below average across most of @entity141 , northern and eastern @entity142 , northern @entity143 and much of south west @entity20			1
this combination of little rain , above average temperatures and near @entity41 conditions in the @entity44 means above normal fire seasons are expected in many areas			2
firefighters fought bushfires in the @entity152 last october when 248 houses and other structures were destroyed across the state firefighters evicted residents and were forced to demolish fire - affected buildings smoke and ash from wildfires burning across the state of @entity142 was visible above @entity10 's cbd last year the worst bushfires since the 1960s tore through @entity142 and devastated the @entity152 area in october			1
at the peak of the fires , on the morning of 18 october , over 100 fires were burning across @entity142			0
the @entity171 @entity170 declared a state of emergency on 20 october , which saw firefighters evict residents and demolish fire - affected buildings			0
as of 19 october 2013 , two people were killed while 248 houses and other structures were destroyed across the state because of the fires			0
dr @entity81 explained that this year large areas of southern @entity20 , especially along the east and west coasts extending inland , @entity143 ’s west coast and central @entity20 , face above normal fire potential for the 2014 - 2015 fire season			1
he said the key learnings from last year 's devastating @entity152 bushfires show that most @entity189 do not have a written bushfire plan			2
@entity109 research conducted in partnership with the @entity99 after the 2013 october bushfires in the @entity152 , @entity191 and @entity193 areas showed that of the 194 people interviewed , 73 per cent indicated they had some form of bushfire plan before the fire , however only seven percent indicated having a written bushfire plan			2
' the research also reveals that people delayed their decision to stay or leave until the bushfire actually threatened and they could see signs such as smoke			0
significantly , very few people proactively left early on the basis of extreme weather forecasts , ' dr @entity81 said			0
he advised that people who live in a bushfire - prone area , including on the edge of a city or town , should make a bushfire survival plan			0
' write it down , talk about it with your family and practice your plan			0
it ’s also important to have a back up plan , as we know from research after @entity225 that things can go wrong			0
what will you do if the pump fails , or the hoses melt ? it ’s important to know what your triggers for different actions are , ' he said .			0

temperatures will reportedly rise above average across @entity20 from october to april
@entity239 the third year in a row @entity20 has experienced record temperatures
2013 's record highs were due to man - made climate change , five reports concluded this week
increasing number of bad bushfire weather days are predicated in southern and eastern states
