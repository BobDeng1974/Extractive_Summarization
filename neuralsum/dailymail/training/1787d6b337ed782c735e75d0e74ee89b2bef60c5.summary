@entity0 says it will be payback time when @entity2 face @entity3 in @entity4 on saturday for a place in the @entity7 final			1
the clash at the futuristic @entity9 will be the first meeting of the teams since @entity12 's converted try 20 seconds from the end of last november 's @entity14 semi-final at @entity16 cruelly denied @entity2 a place in the final			1
@entity18 has gone on record to say the effects of that heart - breaking finish ' will probably stay with me until the day i die ' but @entity0 reckons victory on saturday would go some way towards erasing the bitter memory			1
@entity12 scored the winning try for @entity3 to break @entity2 hearts at @entity16 last november ' i know that all the players involved were hurting after that game , as you can imagine , ' @entity0 said			1
' we certainly feel like we owe them one for that , with @entity12 getting one over us in the last minute			2
' @entity0 became a team - mate of @entity12 's after the @entity14 and has witnessed the creative skills of the talented half - back close up during his maiden season in the @entity40			1
the @entity2 full - back will be up against another three of his @entity43 club - mates in @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 and has been able to offer coach @entity48 and the squad an insight into their strengths and weaknesses			1
' i was getting asked a few questions - ' what does this bloke do ? ' and things like that , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity58 ( right ) and his @entity2 team - mates look dejected at the final whistle ' i 've offered a couple of little bits to the coaches on how certain players play but nothing you ca n't see by watching the video of how they played against @entity69 and @entity70			1
the @entity72 lads that are playing are all world class			2
' the @entity75 are a very good side , as we all know , and we are going to have to do a great job to go out and beat them			2
we are going to give it our best			0
' the @entity7 has reunited @entity0 with seven of his old @entity82 team - mates , including older brother @entity83 , who returned to the 13 - man code in the summer after a three - year flirtation with rugby union			1
' it 's good to have some familiar faces around and it 's good especially with the amount of young lads in this group , ' said @entity0			1
' they have added a bit of energy to the group , so it 's a good place to be			2
@entity0 says it 's payback time when @entity2 face @entity3 on saturday ' i have certainly missed playing alongside @entity83			1
it 's been a few years now but i think he is enjoying being back in league			2
it 's where he belongs - he is a league player really			2
' @entity83 was a surprise addition to @entity48 's 24 - man squad after playing just seven games for his club but has started both @entity7 matches so far and is set to win his sixth cap on saturday			2
he is delighted to be back in league but modestly plays down comparisons with other cross-code returnees			0
' guys like @entity113 and @entity114 are at a different level to me , ' he said			0
' i 'm just a bloke trying to do his best and not a superstar like them			0
' it was an amazing experience in rugby union			0
opportunities like that do n't come around very often and to play at @entity123 against those teams was special			0
@entity125 celebrates his try against @entity70 in @entity127 last week ' i really enjoyed it but i was approached to return to league and the timing was perfect			0
' i feel i am a better league player than union player			0
that is the bottom line			0
' @entity83 , who was in the team alongside @entity0 that lost to @entity3 in @entity134 four years ago , is confident the @entity2 pack can lay a foundation for the 10 - point victory that would secure a return trip to the @entity139 on saturday week			1
' we 've got a bit of experience playing the @entity75 so we 'll go into the test with some confidence and hopefully get the job done , ' he said			0
' they 've probably been the best pack around for the past few years so hopefully we can lay down a marker and go toe to toe with them			0
' we have to win by 10 or more , which does add a little pressure , but we 'll be trying not to think about that too much			0
if we put on a good performance , the points will come			0

@entity4 clash will be first meeting between sides since @entity14 semi
@entity12 's last - gasp try broke @entity2 hearts at @entity16 last year
@entity0 says it will be payback time as @entity2 try to avenge loss
