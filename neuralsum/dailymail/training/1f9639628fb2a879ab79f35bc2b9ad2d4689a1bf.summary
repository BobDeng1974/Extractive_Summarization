a young widow whose husband was shot dead while out for an early morning walk is talking about her pain and loss 10 months after the tragic incident			1
@entity6 of @entity7 , @entity8 , was killed by a 16 - year - old with no motive on april 1 while his wife @entity11 was eight - months pregnant with their first child			1
now , @entity11 has given birth to a beautiful baby girl @entity14 , and knowing that she will never get a chance to meet her father , she has decided to do something to make sure no one else will every have to go through what she and her daughter have been forced to endure			1
and she also wants to make sure her daughter never forgets her father , even though they will never meet one another , so she hung his photo over her crib			2
' i wanted a picture where he was looking down over her and that one came to mind immediately			2
i think that would be perfect			0
i want her to see him every day			2
i want her to know who her daddy is			0
not only that , i want her to know he is watching over her			0
' now she is also focused on getting guns off the streets , particularly illegal guns , by supporting @entity52 , which makes carrying a gun an adult offense for anyone over 14 years of age , and imposes harsher penalties amnd jail sentences for threats with a gun or use of a gun			2
' i want to start by getting this bill passed , then work from there to start making sure our laws are enforced - because what good is another law if it is not enforced , wrote @entity11 on her website , a @entity70			1
' our police force is doing the best they can and they have suffered this past year too			0
but there has to be a way out there to get these criminals off of the streets			0
' she then added ; ' for those who carry guns legally , this will not affect you in any way so long as you use it within the state of the law			0
' @entity88 , a 16 - year - old nicknamed ' @entity89 ' with a long criminal history was charged with @entity6 's murder			1
soon after the crime police released security footage of two males following the 24 - year - old , before one of them shepherded him into a parking lot between two buildings and killed him			2
@entity88 is alleged to have shot another man just two nights before after they ' bumped ' in a steak house car park			2
then he was shot in the neck himself on the evening after @entity6 ’s murder			1
@entity88 wanted to rob @entity6 , police allege			1
but to @entity6 's family , what makes his killing even more senseless , is that he never carried anythingof value on his walks			1
' i have to remind myself every day why he is not next to me , ' said @entity11 @entity11 is working on passing a @entity112 that would impose stricter gun laws @entity88 ( above ) , a 16 - year - old nicknamed ' @entity89 ' with a long criminal history was charged with @entity6 's murder @entity11 also revealed @entity6 always used to take his daily exercise in the evenings , but fatefully changed his routine that week so he could spend more time with her			1
that tuesday was only the second time he had gone for a walk in the morning			0
‘ when he asked me to marry him he said , " i want us both to be saints and for us to go to heaven together , side by side "			0
in his mind our marriage had three people , him , me and @entity129 , ' @entity11 told @entity130 in an interview last year			1
‘ @entity6 actually said i was a better @entity132 than he could ever be , he said i had a child - like faith , i ’m not sure if that ’s true , but i never doubted @entity129 and this has n’t changed that			1
now i just want to become closer to him so i can see @entity137 again			0
’ ' although he has been described as incredibly humble and gracious , @entity11 says @entity6 always believed he was destined for something special and was determined to leave his mark on life			1
' ‘ he had told me he thought he was made for great things , not in an arrogant or presumptuous way ' , @entity11 explained			1
‘ i ’m not sure he really knew what , but he just felt something			0
he wanted to be a teacher , so he could have an impact on people			0
‘ in the last few days people have told me they are going back to church because of @entity137 ’s story			0
he never dreamed that this is how it would end , but knowing people are going back to church and that they have been touched by his story means a lot to me and would mean so much to him			0
‘ he used to invite so many of my friends to come to @entity158 mass and when i saw pictures of how full the church was for his funeral , i thought , he finally did it , he finally got them there			0

@entity6 of @entity7 , @entity8 , was shot dead on april 1 while his wife @entity11 was eight - months pregnant with their first child
