by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 30 july 2012 updated : 08:53 est , 30 july 2012 when life becomes a struggle against a common enemy , it is hopefully a time when warring factions can unite and reconcile their differences			1
perhaps this is the reason for a startling new co-operative friendship between two factions of dolphins , who before have not even bothered to share a tuna snack between them			0
the two bottlenose dolphin populations , living in the clear waters of @entity17 near @entity18 in @entity19 , have rarely interacted - but when fishing boats stopped using the bay , the dolphins got together to forage			1
friends reunited : the bottlenose dolphins of @entity17 are now co-operating on the food forage ( file picture ) @entity29 coast : @entity17 , near @entity18 in @entity19 , is home to two tribes of dolphin - now merged into one group one of the dolphin groups would feed almost entirely on the off - casts from trawler boats , while the other tribe would hunt fish for themselves			1
in what was called ' the parting of the pods ' , the dolphins would never associate			2
but with fishing reduced in the area by around 50 per cent , the dophins 're - engineered ' their relationships			0
speaking to @entity46 , dr @entity47 , marine vertebrate ecologist for the @entity49 , said : ' there 's never been really any experiments looking at social structure ... where you can compare what it was like before and what it is like now			0
social behaviour : the dolphins became friends again in @entity17 , near @entity18 ' the dolphins had basically re-arranged their whole social system after trawling disappeared so they 're now actually interacting again			1
' when relying on natural food sources i guess it 's more important for them to interact with others , or to learn from others , or to co-operate with others to get to these food sources			2
' presumably they 're sharing information , co-operating and things like that			0
' the scientists can tell individual dolphins apart from markings on their dorsal fin - usually scars or notches - and could follow individual dolphins as they moved between packs			0
the behaviour of the divided animals was first noted in the 1990s , but now they hunt together - and perhaps one dolphin was the peace - broker , as he has is now ' fully integrated ' with the other pack .			2

two groups in @entity18 join forces to hunt for food
first time ' joining of the pods ' has been seen in the wild
