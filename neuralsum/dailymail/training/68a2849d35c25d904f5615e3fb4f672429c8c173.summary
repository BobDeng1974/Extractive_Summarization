by @entity0 published : 11:37 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 17:47 est , 13 december 2013 a @entity2 man has filed a lawsuit accusing the notorious affairs website @entity4 of breaking up his 13 - year marriage			0
@entity8 's lawsuit , originally filed last year , names the infidelity website , its @entity11 parent company , @entity12 , and his ex-wife 's lover , @entity15			1
according to court documents , @entity15 , 58 , a married professor of civil engineering , and @entity8 ’s wife , 51 - year - old @entity17 , first met on @entity4 in 2007 and soon began an affair			1
' homewrecker ' : a spurned @entity2 husband is suing the infidelity site @entity4 for allegedly breaking up his 13 - year marriage last october , mr @entity15 and his paramour got married after divorcing their respective spouses			1
@entity8 ’s complaint cited by @entity27 seeking more than $ 10,000 alleges that @entity15 , @entity4 and its parent company came between him and his wife and ' alienated and destroyed ' their love			1
the ' other ' man : @entity33 ' @entity15 , 58 , a married professor of civil engineering , met @entity17 in 2007 on the cheating site , and the two began an affair that ended in a wedding last year @entity2 is one of only a handful of states that still have archaic alienation of affection / criminal conversation laws on the books allowing scorned spouses to seek punitivie damages when a marriage fails due to the actions of a third party			1
in @entity53 's case , the cuckolded 62 - year - old husband claims that the infidelity website and @entity15 alienated his wife , who then went on to have ' criminal conversation - a legal term for extramarital sex - with her paramour			1
@entity59 , the founder of the cheating portal - and a married father of two - dismissed the claims outlined in the lawsuit as nonsensical , telling the paper that his company is no more liable for someone 's split than a hotel room where a tryst had taken place , or a cell phone operator who made it possible for the lovers to communicate			2
the former attorney and sports agent added that @entity4 connects people online but is no way responsible for what their clients choose to do offline			0
‘ i think it would be an incredibly slippery slope to attempt to espouse blame to all the technology and inanimate objects that were utilized in an affair , ’ he told the paper			0
however , @entity8 's attorney , @entity89 , pointed out that @entity59 's argument does not hold water because unlike a hotel room or a cell phone , which have other purposes besides fostering unfaithfulness , @entity4 's sole raison d'etre is to promote affairs			2
in fact , the company 's motto prominently displayed on its homepage goads : ' life is short			0
' defense : @entity4 founder @entity59 said his company is no more liable for someone 's split than a hotel room or a cell phone operator the portal , which has been in operation since 2002 , boasts nearly 23million members and purports to be ' the most famous name in infidelity and married dating			1
' ' @entity4 is the most successful website for finding an affair and cheating partners , ' the company description claims			2
' have an affair today on @entity4			0
' thousands of cheating wives and cheating husbands sign up every day looking for an affair			0
we are the most famous website for discreet encounters between married individuals			0
' @entity8 's lawsuit has ample precedent in @entity2			2
in 2010 , a wronged wife was awarded $ 9million against her husband ’s mistress			0
the following year , a judge ruled in favor of a @entity135 businessman ’s former wife who sued her replacement , awarding her the largest judgement in state history - $ 30million			0
cheating emporium : @entity4 boasts nearly 23million members and purports to be ' the most famous name in infidelity and married dating ' in 2009 , state lawmakers passed a measure protecting employers from being sued under the alienation law since affairs often begin in the workplace			1
now , legal action for breaking up a marriage can be pursued only against a ' natural person ' - but @entity8 's attorney said that since his client 's ex-wife struck up a relationship with another man in 2007 , two years before the passage of the legislation , @entity4 could still be on the hook for thousands of dollars .			2

@entity53 . 62 , is seeking $ 10,000 in damages from @entity4 , its parent company and his ex-wife 's lover , @entity166
lawsuit claims @entity8 's wife , @entity17 , 51 , met @entity15 , 58 , on infidelity site in 2007 and began an affair ; they got married last october
