images of lonely polar bears seemingly stranded on chunks of drifting ice have become one of the defining images of global warming			1
now scientists warn that a quarter of @entity10 polar bears could be wiped out by the end of the century because of shrinking ice caps			1
warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear ’s habitat , affecting their ability to roam across huge expanses of ice to hunt for food			1
scientists warn that a quarter of @entity10 polar bears ( pictured ) could be wiped out by the end of the century because of shrinking ice caps			1
warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear ’s habitat , affecting their ability to roam across huge expanses of ice to hunt for food and mate biologists from the @entity29 believe that as summers get warmer in the @entity32 off the @entity34 continent and @entity35 – more permanent ice cover will melt away every year			1
this means that by 2100 , each polar bear population in the @entity38 may have to endure between two and five months of the year without ice at sea , which would likely lead to starvation and hamper their ability to mate			1
projected global warming would adversely affect one tenth of their habitat , which is being damaged by man - made pollution , according to the study			1
it found that sea ice across the @entity50 is declining and altering the physical characteristics of marine ecosystems			1

a mother and her cubs are pictured carbon emissions from human activities must be cut to net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels			2
other greenhouse gases , such as methane , nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons ( @entity69 ) must reach net zero by the end of the century emissions need to peak within a decade , with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by mid-century			0
delaying taking action until after 2020 will lead to higher costs and increased risks to our way of life			0
predatory animals are vulnerable to these changes in sea ice conditions because a smaller amount of sea ice lessens animals ' opportunities to roam across expanses of ice and catch prey			1
the study , published in @entity92 , used sea ice projections from 2006 to 2100 to gain an insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears			1
biologist @entity97 from @entity29 said : ‘ we predict that nearly one - tenth of the world ’s polar bear habitat , as much as one - quarter of their global population , may undergo significant habitat loss under business - as - usual climate projections			1
’ last week , @entity108 scientists warned that carbon emissions must be cut to zero by at least 2064 if the planet is to avoid the effects of climate change becoming out of control			0
they said that emissions from human activities , such as burning fossil fuels , should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels			2
the stark report , by the @entity121 ( @entity121 ) said that emissions need to peak within a decade , with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by mid-century , in order to avoid sea levels rising and dramatic weather conditions , such as widespread droughts			2
countries have already agreed to limit temperature rises to no more than 2 ° c - beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change are expected - but @entity121 said that if the world carries on as it is , greenhouse gas emissions will be ‘ way beyond safe limits ’			0
another study has revealed that the population of endangered @entity140 penguins fell by 70 per cent between 2001 and 2013 and is continuing to decline			2
there are less than 18,000 breeding pairs left in the wild in @entity144			0
every year , experts from @entity147 rescue chicks abandoned by their parents foraging for food , but this year they say the chicks are coming in early ‘ in their hundreds ’			2
a study has revealed that the population of endangered @entity140 penguins fell by 70 per cent between 2001 and 2013 and is continuing to decline the crisis is not a direct result of global warming , but due to falling fish stocks			2
the rehabilitation centre in @entity144 is already helping to care for 430 and the numbers are growing at a previously unseen rate			0
because if the soaring price of fish , the @entity147 has launched an appeal to feed and care for the chicks			0
dr @entity166 , director of conservation at @entity147 said : ‘ unless conservation organisations intervene , these chicks will starve to death			0
‘ as african penguin populations are currently facing a crisis due to a diminished food supply near their nesting colonies , there is a substantial risk that this species could eventually become extinct without action			0
’ chicks are abandoned at this time of year just before their parents start their moulting cycle , when they develop a new set of waterproof feathers			0
adult @entity140 penguins still need to make foraging trips during this time and leave their chicks behind			0
due to an increasing decline in fish stocks , penguins have to journey further afield for their food but are unable to swim before their moulting cycle			0
this means that they can not feed their chicks that are not old enough to fend for themselves , resulting in abandonment and starvation			0

warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear ’s habitat
by 2100 , each polar bear population in the the @entity38 may have to endure two and five months of the year without ice at sea
loss of ice would stop predators hunting for food and mating
