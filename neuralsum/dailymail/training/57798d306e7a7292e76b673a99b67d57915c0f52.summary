@entity0 have vowed to take on the @entity1 after midfielder @entity2 was handed a two - match ban for spitting on @entity4 – despite the @entity6 winger insisting the incident did not happen			1
in the wake of the surprise verdict , the @entity9 club offered @entity2 their full backing to and announced plans to appeal – only to be informed there was no right of appeal in @entity1 @entity18 cases			2
a ‘ stunned ’ @entity0 however vowed not to back down and released a scathing statement attacking new @entity1 compliance officer @entity20 and the @entity21 for the ‘ incredulous ’ and ‘ mystifying ’ decision to find @entity2 guilty			1
this is the incident where @entity0 's @entity2 was said to have spat at @entity6 's @entity4 @entity4 tweeted ' @entity2 never spat at me ' three days after the incident but the charge has been upheld @entity0 midfielder @entity2 ( left ) has been banned for two matches for spitting at @entity4 ' the player will certainly be appealing this decision and will be given our full backing in this matter			1
' the decision today relating to @entity2 is incredulous			0

' last night the @entity1 confirmed to @entity56 there is no right of appeal meaning @entity2 is banned for sunday ’s home match against champions @entity61 and the following week ’s visit to @entity63			1
‘ we are of the opinion that the wording of the current rules allows us to challenge a fundamentally flawed decision – like this undoubtedly is , ’ a defiant @entity0 spokesman insisted			0
‘ we will contest this ban as hard as we can			0
’ @entity0 had believed their written submission to the @entity1 - containing blown - up footage of the alleged incident - in addition to @entity4 ’ strong denial on @entity78 that any spitting occurred , would see their player exonerated			1
after @entity2 was handed the two - game ban , however , a furious @entity0 went on the offensive			2
‘ the player will certainly be appealing this decision and will be given our full backing in this matter , ’ a club statement said			0
‘ the decision relating to @entity2 is incredulous			0
we are stunned firstly that it was brought in front of the @entity21 by the new compliance officer and secondly that the @entity21 have found the player guilty of something that we do not believe to have taken place			0
‘ it is truly mystifying that three people in a room at @entity43 in @entity44 on a thursday afternoon can see something that was not seen by the referee , first assistant , second assistant , fourth official , @entity51 delegate , the managers of either team , the players of either team including the alleged villain and victim not to mention the 11,168 supporters in the stadium			0
‘ as part of our original defence submission we studied enlarged video footage to ensure our player was not guilty of such an offence			0
we were sound in our belief that no such action had taken place and we will continue to support the player in this matter through the appeal process			0
