parents have renamed a @entity2 primary school the ' @entity3 ' after it banned @entity4 from the timetable			1
@entity6 has decided there will be no nativity play for its pupils because of its poor academic performance			0
the school in @entity12 , near @entity13 , whose students are aged four to 11 , says the festivities would interrupt pupil learning as it strives to improve achievements in maths and @entity20			1
@entity4 : @entity6 has axed its nativity play because it wants children in class because it wants to improve academic performance ( file picture ) parents believe the children are being deliberately punished because the move came just days after the school , prior to its academy conversion , was ranked last out of 44 in @entity30 in @entity31 @entity33 rankings in @entity35 rankings			1
@entity36 , whose child attends the school , said : ' they have stolen @entity4 from the @entity38 should be called the @entity3			1
where is the fun ? ' they can take children out of class for assemblies but they ca n't find the time to organise a play ? to say they can not have @entity4 until their grades improve is really unfair			1
' surely getting the students to learn a script for a festive play would aid learning , and the performance would build confidence			0
how can that not be of benefit to their education ? the children are really disappointed ; it has really affected them			0
' why ca n't they have a bit of fun on the last days of school ? ' @entity64 , 38 , whose daughter @entity65 , 6 , attends the school , said @entity4 could have been incorporated into the children 's lessons			1
she said : ' while i agree that the school needs to focus on education , with a bit of planning they could easily have incorporated things like a nativity into lessons			0
it 's educational for the children to learn about things like that and it 's also an important part of their childhood			0
' they are not at secondary school level , they are just primary school @entity84 's also been a lot of bad feeling because the school left it so late in the day to tell us			1
if they were going to do this , they should have communicated it earlier to save as much upset			0
' a spokesperson from @entity94 said : ' the academy realises that some parents are disappointed that we 're not putting on a @entity4 play this year			2
' this is because such plays take many weeks of rehearsal time and , given the current context at @entity102 with very low standards of attainment , the academy needs to prioritise and focus rigorously on raising standards in @entity20 and maths for all our students			1
' to do this , our students need to focus on their school work throughout the term			0
however , this far from means that we 're not having any other @entity4 activities and celebrations at the academy and these include a visiting theatre company , special @entity4 assemblies , a @entity4 fair , carols around the tree and a @entity4 dinner for students and their parents to attend			2
' in the future , when education standards have been notably raised at the academy , there will be an opportunity to re-introduce termly music and drama productions without compromising the students ' entitlement to success and progress in key areas such and reading , writing and maths			0
' and a spokesperson from the @entity6 group , which runs the academy , said : ' there is a certain irony to the situation , in that people would think a @entity2 organisation would try to cancel @entity4			2
' @entity4 has not been cancelled and there have been other festive events put on instead of a nativity @entity150 understand that might upset some parents but we are trying to do what is best for the students			2

@entity6 staff believe weeks of rehearsals would be better used as lessons
primary school is *desperate* to improve maths and @entity20 standards
parents say their children are being unfairly punished and *teachers* have ' stolen ' @entity4
