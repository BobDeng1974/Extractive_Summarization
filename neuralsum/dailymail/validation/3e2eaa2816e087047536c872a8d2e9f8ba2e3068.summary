@entity0 was banned for seven games for his part in the spitting storm that also involved @entity5 defender @entity4			1
@entity4 himself is facing a ban of six matches if found guilty after the @entity9 charged both men			1
the incident came during @entity5 ’s 1 - 0 win at @entity13 on wednesday night when the pair spat at each other following a first - half tangle			1
@entity4 appears to launch spit in the direction of the floored @entity13 striker @entity0 subsequently retaliates , and appears to aim spit of his own back at the @entity5 man @entity4 ( left ) and @entity0 clash near the half - way line at @entity24 following the unpleasant exchange @entity26 ( a ) , march 15 @entity27 ( h ) , march 21 @entity29 ( a ) , april 5 @entity30 ( a ) , april 13 @entity31 ( h ) , april 19 @entity33 ( h ) , april 25 @entity35 ( a ) , may 2 both @entity13 striker @entity0 , who admitted the charge , and @entity4 released statements on thursday in which they disagreed on the intent behind the disgusting scenes			1
bizarrely , @entity4 claimed he was shocked by the allegations and protested his innocence			0
@entity0 responded by apologising but said he was provoked when @entity4 spat at him			2
indeed , @entity43 understands that @entity0 is furious that the @entity44 international has not admitted his guilt , and is adamant the defender spat at his leg			2
and @entity0 will inform @entity9 disciplinary chiefs that @entity4 intentionally spat at him when questioned about the incident			1
@entity0 has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the @entity9 on thursday this season , @entity9 guidelines dictate that the punishment for spitting should be in line with @entity59 's six game ban for the offence			1
@entity0 faces an additional one game ban because he has already been sent off for violent conduct after elbowing @entity26 's @entity63 ( above ) in december			1
having conceded he was wrong to react by spitting in @entity4 ’s face , @entity0 will be fined a week ’s wages of around £ 40,000 by @entity13 , who will now be without their 11 - goal top scorer until may			1
@entity9 rules were changed in the summer to bring them in line with @entity59 guidelines which state a player found guilty of spitting at an opponent will be suspended for six games			2
however , @entity0 has already served a three - match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing @entity26 ’s @entity63 and as a result will be hit with an additional one - game suspension			1
he will not return until the final three matches of the campaign			0
@entity4 , meanwhile , could miss crucial @entity83 fixtures against @entity31 , @entity30 , @entity84 and @entity85 should he be found guilty			0
but the 27 - year - old will contest the charge , to which he must respond by 6pm on friday evening			1
the @entity90 striker points the finger at @entity5 defender @entity4 after the ugly incident @entity13 managing director @entity94 said : ' both ourselves and @entity0 agree that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable			1
' in life , when you do something wrong you have to front up , admit your mistakes and accept the punishment			0
@entity0 was proactive this morning in making a full and heartfelt apology , which he did in advance of any notification from the @entity9 regarding this charge			1
' this was something he felt strongly about and we fully support him in quickly accepting the charge			0
' @entity0 is known to many of our region 's schools , community groups and junior football teams for his involvement in the work of the @entity118			2
' he has this evening expressed to us his strong desire to engage in additional community activities during the period of his ban			0
' he is particularly keen to use his position as a role model to encourage young and influential fans to engage in sport and learn lessons about the importance of fair play and personal conduct			0
' @entity4 ’s statement read : ‘ having woken up this morning i am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night ’s match			2
i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at @entity0			2
‘ i was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor			2
‘ during the game @entity0 and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting			1
‘ it is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something i have ever done or would ever do			0
it is certainly not something that i did last night			0
’ tempers threaten to boil over as team - mates from @entity13 and @entity5 gather on the pitch @entity0 was banned for an extra man after @entity161 sent off for elbowing @entity26 's @entity63 in december the @entity9 were waiting for referee @entity163 's report			1
as he missed the incident between @entity4 and @entity165 , and it was n't included in his report - the @entity9 were within their right to retrospectively punish the pair			1
@entity171 striker @entity170 was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at @entity84 goalkeeper @entity174			0
however , the @entity9 have issued new guidelines to move in line with new @entity59 guidelines meaning @entity4 and @entity0 could now be banned for six games			1
@entity0 responded less than an hour later by saying : ‘ i have apologies to make to a lot of people today			0
firstly to my team - mates and to our supporters , secondly to @entity4 , and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and @entity4			2
‘ i reacted to something i found very unpleasant			0
sometimes it is hard not to react , particularly in the heat of the moment			0
i have always tried hard to be a positive role model , especially for our young fans , and yesterday i let you down			0
‘ i hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry			0
perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake , not copy it			0
