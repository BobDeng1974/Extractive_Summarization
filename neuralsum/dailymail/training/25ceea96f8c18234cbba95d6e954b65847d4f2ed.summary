by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 07:48 est , 20 june 2013 for decades historians have tried to convince us that @entity3 were nothing but peaceful traders and farmers			0
but now , historians in @entity8 have shown that they were in fact the fearsome warriors we had previously thought them to be			1
archaeologists behind ‘ @entity11 ’ , an exhibition at the @entity13 , have explored the traditional idea of raiders and pillagers , inspiring fear wherever their longboats would take them			1
the massive warship would have held 100 men , and 36 pairs of oars			1
it is thought that only royalty could have afforded to pay for such a vessel the exhibition was opened by @entity27 of @entity28 today , and will arrive in @entity29 next year to launch the @entity31 ’s new exhibition space			1
it focuses on the weaponry that @entity3 would have used , such as swords , spears and arrows			0
archaeologist and co-coordinator @entity37 told the @entity39 : the arrow shape did more damage			0
the wounds were bigger and more difficult to heal than a straight edged slit			0
’ also featured is the longest @entity11 warship ever found			1
at 36m in length , it is surrounded by swords and battle axes , showing the power and fear that the warriors would have invoked			2
organisers of the exhibition ( right ) decided to display as many @entity11 swords ( left ) as they could the exhibition features jewellery and clothing from the period , showing the wealth that @entity3 sought vikings were traders , farmers , raiders and mercenaries with many amassing large collections of gold characters like @entity67 given an impression of @entity3 being friendlier than they perhaps were @entity69 said : ‘ some of my colleagues thought surely one sword is enough but i said no one can ever have too many swords			1
’ made from oak felled in 1025 in @entity75 , it would have held 100 men and 36 pairs of oars			1
the ship was found in @entity80 , home to a museum that was built to hold a fleet of @entity11 boats that were sunk 1,000 years ago to protect the harbour			2
the vessel is thought to have taken 30,000 hours of labour to make , and it is likely that only royalty would have had the resources to pay for such a vessel			2
historians point to @entity92 the @entity93 as a possible owner , as he conquered @entity95 in 1028 and @entity96 in 1016			0
the exhibition , which is the largest of its kind in 20 years , also explores the idea of @entity3 as mercenaries , travelling to @entity102 and @entity103			2
other objects featured include pieces of amber and jewellery incorporating byzantine coins , and a pair of gold brooches created in the shape of tiny animals			0
an inscribed silver collar from @entity95 suggests that they came to @entity115 to ‘ exchange war garments from them ’ but it is suggested that collars were used for slavery			0
iron slave collars from @entity121 show that the @entity3 sought more than gold and silver			0
the jewellery and metalwork on display shows the intricate carvings and designs favoured at the time the exhibition , featuring @entity11 artwork , will travel to the @entity31 next year the exhibition takes in artifacts from collections across @entity134 , including the @entity136 carvings from @entity137			1
organisers hope that it will help show all wides of @entity11 life			2
@entity69 added : probably only a small percentage of the @entity3 ever went to sea on raiding parties , but i think that those who stayed home would have told stories of great warriors , great ships and great swords			0

new exhibition explores the fearsome and *dangerous* side of @entity11 warriors
features a *30m* warship that would have held 100 men and 36 pairs of oars
it is thought that only royalty could have afforded a vessel so large
