@entity0 will leave no room for sentiment when solving his goalkeeping dilemma for @entity6 's @entity5 final against @entity7			1
@entity8 has started all of @entity6 's games on their charge to @entity12 , but @entity0 must balance that loyalty against the risks of leaving @entity15 , one of the world 's finest goalkeepers , on the bench			1
@entity0 promised that only cold judgement would be applied in his selection , which he claimed would not be known by the players until saturday or sunday morning before heading to the stadium			1
@entity8 has started all of @entity6 's @entity5 games on their charge to @entity12 but the former @entity25 keeper may be dropped for the final against @entity7 on sunday he said : ' in each game and every game i take a decision and analyse which is the best side to pick			1
' those who get left out need to be kept on board for the rest of the season though			0
the players know that only 18 players can be in the squad and only 11 can start			0
it 's not a different rule for the final			0
' the players , like on the first day , need to understand that i am the boss			0
i decide the squad , i decide the starting xi and i decide who plays and who does not			0
@entity6 manager @entity47 could opt to start his first - choice keeper @entity15 instead @entity0 said the players had to understand that he was the manager and he picks the team ' it is true that it is a final and an important game but the players need to accept my decision			1
' @entity0 's selection in thursday 's @entity57 exit against @entity58 saw @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 left on the bench			0
all are understood to be in line to start against @entity7			2
@entity0 , who was on @entity67 's bench for their 2006 @entity69 final win , added : ' when you are in football and you are a player , when you sign the contract it is for training , for your best in that and after you have to wait for the decision of the manager			2
