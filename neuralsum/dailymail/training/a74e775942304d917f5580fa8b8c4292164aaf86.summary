@entity0 and @entity1 fought out a @entity3 stalemate as @entity4 starred for the hosts in goal while @entity7 struggled to show his predatory best up front			1
@entity1 boss @entity10 considered the result the loss of two points while @entity0 ' @entity14 will feel fortunate to have salvaged a point from the scoreless draw			1
@entity18 's @entity17 was at @entity19 and assessed all of the players ' performances			1
@entity0 keeper @entity4 made the difference with saves such as this from @entity26 @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity4 – saved by @entity27 in first half but solid , as always			1
a number of fine saves , the best of which was his acrobatic swipe at a @entity34 shot			1
never faltered on the routine stops			0
8 @entity27 – superb last - ditch clearance off the line in first half after @entity41 free - kick came back off the post , but struggled to contain @entity34			1
6 fearless star man @entity4 made a number of fine saves and was faultless on routine stops @entity46 – still capable of passing to no - one when under little pressure , but managed a number of decent challenges			1
6 @entity50 – not helped by @entity14 ’s high defensive line and part of a unit that failed to win enough balls into the box			0
6 @entity56 – had an easier afternoon than @entity27 and dealt comfortably with @entity57			0
solid but rarely allowed to utilise his ability to get forward			0
6 @entity56 was solid for @entity0 at left back but was rarely able to impose himself going forward @entity60 - booked for first - half foul on @entity62 and kicked out at @entity63 after the break			1
along with @entity65 , never got hold of midfield			2
5.5 @entity65 – good in the tackle , but too wasteful in possession			0
when he was teed up by a lovely @entity72 pass in second half , he was way off target			0
5.5 @entity75 – impressive start and made a good chance for @entity72 , but faded badly			2
needed to offer @entity27 more help in dealing with @entity34			0
6 @entity75 started impressively and made a chance for @entity72 but faded badly at the end @entity81 – barely noticed he was on the pitch until late free - kick that at least got @entity84 moving			1
improved in second half but needed to look for ball more			0
5.5 @entity87 – replaced by @entity88 after an ineffective performance			0
had scope to target a suspect defence but lacked service and made little use of ball when it did come			2
5 @entity72 – one reasonable first - half chance from a @entity75 pass that he failed to connect with properly , but played a superb ball for @entity65 late on which could have settled it			1
6 a rare day for @entity72 in that it came without a goal and almost won it for @entity0 with an assist substitutes : @entity88 for @entity103 ( 78 ) , @entity104 for @entity75 ( 79 ) subs not used : @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 manager : @entity14 - his side improved , but odd to see him do so little when @entity1 were dominating the first half			1
his defence and its high line looked at times like an accident waiting to happen			2
6 @entity1 ( 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity117 – sharp but generally untested			1
saved from @entity118 in first half and also kept out @entity81 ’s late free - kick			2
6 keeper @entity117 makes what is eventually a routine save in a match where he was rarely tested @entity63 – not much to do at the back and had a goal ruled out at the other end			2
fine challenge to deny @entity46 in second half			0
6.5 @entity129 – not convincing in possession and played himself into trouble in first half			2
silly booking for body - checking @entity72 and replaced by @entity134			2
5 @entity135 – targeted early on by @entity75 but held his own well			0
6 @entity1 defender @entity63 ( right ) made a fine second - half challenge on @entity46 ( left ) in the second half @entity140 – quiet first half and replaced by @entity142 at half - time			1
5.5 @entity62 – lofted an utterly magnificent pass into @entity147 path at the end of the first half			1
always composed and always looking for runs			0
7.5 @entity151 – excelled in his deep role in first half , having plenty of possession and a great source of tempo for @entity1			1
but fluffed a first - half header and struggled to get in game in second half			2
lucky not to conceded penalty for grappling @entity72 in the box			0
6.5 @entity151 excelled in his deep role but fluffed his lines when he had good opportunities in attack @entity34 – his revival continues			0
thrived in the space created by @entity0 ’ s high defensive line and forced a stunning first - half save from @entity4			1
some good work defensively , as well			0
7 @entity41 – stunning free - kick deflected off wall onto post in first half and showed his usual excellent range of passing			0
frequently lost possession because of poor touches and sent a weak shot straight at @entity4 in first hald			1
for such a renowned predator , he never looked dangerous			1
4 for such a renowned predator , @entity7 never looked dangerous up front for @entity1 @entity26 – nearly scored a @entity186 goal in first half after bringing down @entity62 pass on his toe but failed to get a shot off			1
also ballooned a volley over early in second half			0
5 substitutes : @entity142 for @entity57 ( 45 )			0
@entity134 for @entity129 ( 76 ) @entity137 for @entity135 ( 72 ) subs not used : @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197			0
manager : @entity10 - @entity199 , the @entity200 only introduced defenders from the bench , perhaps because his side was tiring so noticeably in the second half			0

@entity4 made a series of *fantastic* saves for @entity0 in scoreless draw
@entity62 oozed composure in @entity1 's midfield
@entity1 *striker* @entity7 never looked dangerous in front of goal
@entity0 and @entity1 played out a 0 - 0 draw on *sunday*
