by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 13:57 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 16:26 est , 24 september 2013 an @entity4 con man man who romanced @entity5 before spending 4 - 1/2 years in federal prison for fraud was knee - deep in the world of @entity9 and @entity10 before his arrest and a catastrophic downfall , a new report reveals			1
@entity13 , whom federal prosecutors sent to prison in 2008 for defrauding his backers , accepted a $ 50 million investment three years earlier from the @entity18 , where @entity19 was the senior adviser , @entity20 reports			1
while the money was earmarked for buying properties from the @entity23 and converting them into commercial developments , @entity13 spent much of it on himself and @entity5			1
he also claimed to be the @entity27 's chief financial officer at one point			0
@entity13 's personal receipts later included $ 37,000 per month for an apartment complete with an executive chef and a private dog - walker , and at least one $ 107,000 jet rental for him and @entity5 to join the @entity34 for @entity35 at @entity38 ’s @entity37 estate			1
happier times : @entity13 and @entity5 were a pair in 2008 at the @entity41 , but a few months later the fraudster was in handcuffs with a $ 21 million bail order @entity45 ( r ) rose from a @entity47 internship to become the ultimate gatekeeper to @entity19 @entity49 : among @entity13 's well - connected friends were @entity53 @entity52 sen. @entity51 ( @entity54 ) and @entity55 ( r ) , the @entity57 ' candidate for @entity59 governor ' in his recently published autobiography , ' the @entity61 reported in 2007 , ' @entity55 , a @entity57 leader who is now chairman of @entity51 [ @entity10 ] @entity19 's presidential campaign , includes a group photo from a january 2006 party in the @entity37 resort of @entity66			1
it shows mr. and mrs. @entity55 , @entity9 and @entity10 , @entity69 , ms. @entity5 and mr. @entity13			1
' @entity55 is now locked in a neck - and - neck @entity59 gubernatorial election battle with the state 's @entity52 attorney general , @entity71			0
@entity73 , @entity19 's 41 - year - old former ' body man , ' became super-rich from his association with the former president and now owns a trio of adjoining @entity78 apartments valued at $ 10.3 million			1
band 's entree to the jet set came through @entity13 , whose meteoric rise into @entity78 's financial elite was fueled , prosecutors later found , by lies			2
' @entity13 courted @entity45 by playing on his taste for the high life , ' according to @entity20			0
the fraudster invited band and his then - girlfriend to fancy dinners and introduced them to the rich and famous			2
' @entity45 was exposed to another universe , ' former @entity13 publicist @entity92 told the magazine			0
' the cosmetics of it worked for everybody			0
' @entity73 , who was -- and still is -- @entity19 's gatekeeper , reciprocated by bringing @entity13 to meet the super-wealthy in the former president 's inner circle , some of whom later invested with the con man			1
once firmly inside the @entity105 , @entity13 brought @entity5 within arm 's reach of the former @entity109 charmer @entity19 and his longtime pal billionaire @entity110 ( r ) put $ 50 million into @entity13 's fabricated plan to buy up church properties , based on an introduction from @entity19 ' body man ' @entity73 ' with @entity45 ’s help , ' according to the lengthy article , ' @entity13 got meetings with , among others , @entity19 himself , @entity110 , and @entity119 , the richest man in the world , aboard @entity119 ’s yacht in the @entity122			1
' ' @entity119 declined to invest , but another introduction paid off : through another @entity19 contact , @entity124 , @entity45 hooked @entity13 up with @entity126 , the head of @entity128 - based @entity127 , who kicked in $ 6 million			1
' @entity110 , a billionaire and long - time ' @entity129 , ' took a meeting with @entity13 in 2005 and inked a deal to buy the church properties , based on the grifter 's promise that he had special access at the @entity27			2
one year later , @entity137 was suing for breach of contract			0
when that money came in , @entity13 paid $ 400,000 to a shell company that @entity45 had set up to allow businesses , including @entity137 , to supplement his income so he could afford to work for @entity19 on a relatively modest $ 110,000 salary			1
with that money in hand , @entity45 and his brother @entity145 made $ 4,600 contributions -- the maximum allowed at the time -- to @entity10 's presidential campaign			2
@entity73 told @entity20 that he eventually repaid the $ 400,000 payoff , sending it to @entity126 directly			2
but that development came in 2007 , after @entity137 sued @entity13 and press inquiries began to percolate			0
in 2006 , @entity13 was also wooing at least one prominent @entity52 at the time : @entity53 sen. @entity51			0
a photograph published by the liberal magazine @entity158 shows @entity13 greeting guests while the senator walks up the gangplank of a yacht on his 70th birthday in 2006			0
@entity13 had rented the boat for a month to sail the @entity165			0
@entity51 was in @entity166 as part of a congressional - delegation trip			0
@entity13 once took @entity5 for an audience with pope @entity170 , cementing his contrived image as a @entity27 insider ' a few months after @entity51 's yacht party , ' @entity158 reported , ' @entity13 strengthened his ties to @entity51 's orbit by retaining @entity178 's well - connected @entity177 lobbying firm , @entity176 , and offering @entity178 both an investment deal and help in securing the @entity181 vote for @entity51 's presidential bid			1
' once , at an annual meeting of the then - one - year - old @entity185 , the former president seemed to give @entity13 his own public imprimatur with an on - stage embrace			2
the rub : as former secretary of state @entity10 girds up for a 2016 presidential campaign , she can ill afford any hints of financial impropriety surrounding her famous political family at the september 21 , 2006 event , @entity19 called the swindler to the stage and thanked him for a $ 50 million pledge , which was earmarked for vaccinating @entity199 children against hepatitis a. that money never materialized			1
' why anyone would allow him to get close to @entity19 and be on a stage saying he ’s going to give $ 50 million away ? ' one @entity19 insider told @entity205 two years later , speaking of @entity45			1
' it ’s absolutely nuts			0
' band largely traded on his access to @entity19 , @entity20 reported			0
in one case a company hoping for a @entity19 speech at a conference approached @entity45 for guidance			0
in addition to recommending a sizable donation to the @entity185 , he also reportedly said the company should ' also pay you for having made that happen ' ' @entity73 has always been reasonably commercial , let ’s just say , ' a former @entity47 colleague said			2
' he was a gatekeeper who charged tolls			0
' @entity13 is now back in @entity4 , with his felony convictions for wire fraud , money laundering and conspiracy behind him			2
a spokesman for @entity10 , the former @entity1 senator who is now exploring a presidential run , did not respond to e-mailed questions about @entity45 's role in her previous campaigns , and whether she ever benefited from @entity13 's short - lived financial connections			1
@entity73 also has not responded to a phone message seeking comment .			0

@entity236 , @entity5 's ex , spent 4 - 1/2 years in federal prison for defrauding investors
@entity19 *consigliere* @entity73 introduced the con man to the @entity19 orbit after he pledged $ 50 million to the @entity185 *initiative* , money that was never paid
an investment fund where @entity19 was the chief adviser put $ 50 million into a bogus @entity13 *scheme* to buy and develop @entity23 properties
the @entity19 connection to a convicted fraudster wo *n't* help @entity10 as she gears up to run for president in 2016
