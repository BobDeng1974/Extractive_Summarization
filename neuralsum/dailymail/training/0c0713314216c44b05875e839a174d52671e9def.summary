by @entity0 for the @entity1 it is n't quite the 44 damned days of @entity5 's @entity4 reign 40 years ago , but it appears @entity8 's time at @entity9 will not last a great deal longer			1
just 65 days into @entity12 's experiment with an unknown manager plucked from @entity14 , he has apparently already been given the @entity16 thumbs down			1
the unforgiving @entity18 owner , who famously got through 36 managers in 22 years at @entity20 , will pull the trigger once again unless there is an instant upturn in fortunes , starting with wednesday 's @entity26 derby with @entity27			2
staying power : @entity29 will not be sacked as @entity4 manager despite recent poor results @entity8 , hired from @entity33 side @entity32 in june , was understandably exasperated after his side finished with nine men in the defeat at @entity37			1
but as he spoke of the ' green shoots and signs of recovery ' @entity4 are apparently showing , he did not come across as a man expecting to lose his job			1
' i strongly believe that with the players i 've got , i 'm doing a decent job , ' he said			2
' barring that moment of madness , we would have come away with something			2
' that moment came on 58 minutes when debutant defender @entity51 miskicked a clearance , allowing the livewire @entity54 through on goal			2
@entity51 dragged him down , was sent off and @entity56 scored from the spot to make it 2 - 1			2
he has apologised to the team — for what it 's worth , ' @entity8 said			1
' it 's something i ca n't legislate for			2
' until then , @entity4 had been just about a match for @entity66 's in - form side			1
afterwards , they lost the plot , conceding twice more — to @entity54 and @entity68 — and saw @entity69 sent off in stoppage time for stupidly lashing out at @entity71			0
@entity8 added : ' even though it was 4 - 1 today , i do n't really think anyone can go away and say they were that much better than you and they ripped the pants off you			1
' yet @entity12 deals solely in cold , hard facts and @entity8 has presided over three defeats from four , leaving @entity4 a solitary point above the @entity82 drop zone			1
u-turn : @entity4 owner @entity12 had decided to sack the manager before changing his mind the @entity18 was not amused and another defeat is likely to see time called on his experiment and @entity8 's contract ripped up			1
with hindsight , the writing has always been on the wall			0
the 2,000 - strong travelling contingent at @entity95 reflected long - held frustrations when they sang ' we 're s * * * and we 're sick of it ' during the second half			0
it 's been a long decade in the wilderness since @entity4 dropped out of the @entity102 and @entity8 was hardly the high - profile , proven appointment the fans expected when @entity105 left last season			1
@entity12 admitted that @entity8 was working with an incomplete squad last week but some of those brought in do n't look up to it			1
@entity51 endured a nightmare start and new striker @entity112 was badly off the pace			0
slump : @entity4 are perilously close to the relegation zone after losing three of their four opening games when another , @entity119 , was subbed at 2 - 1 to avoid picking up an injury , the away fans jeered @entity121			1
and this dismal performance was against a @entity37 side supposedly in a crisis of their own			2
when @entity128 scored at @entity129 in midweek , he celebrated by shouting abuse at @entity131 , leading to rumours of a camp unhappy at the @entity18 's constant rotation			0
but he 'll be sticking by his methods after this performance , which saw the @entity137 soar to second in the table			0
@entity128 was nowhere near the squad against @entity4 but will return			1
@entity66 said : ' i did not see that celebration			0
this belongs to the past			0
i need all of my players			0
' if only @entity121 could rewind history too			0
his troubles are very much in the present			0
performance of the weekend @entity151 has restored passion and purpose at @entity154 and they 're flying high in the @entity82 after a 4 - 0 thumping of @entity157			1
winger @entity158 scored twice and set up another against his former employers , while £ 5m signing @entity160 now has four in four @entity102 games			2
' the new signings have really hit the ground running , ' said a delighted @entity151			0
delighted : @entity151 has made an immediate impact at @entity154 since becoming manager elsewhere ... @entity167 could get the sack if @entity169 lose to @entity170 in the @entity26 tomorrow			1
they are rock bottom after a 5 - 1 loss at @entity174			0
' the result was very bad and so now is the time to change , ' he said afterwards			0
we presume he meant team selection , not his job			2
@entity180 scored maybe the goal of the weekend for @entity182 against @entity183 , picking out the top corner with a 25 - yard cracker at @entity186			0
@entity188 's perfect start continued with a 2 - 1 win at @entity190 in @entity191			0
teenage striker @entity192 grabbed both goals in another impressive display			0
dogfight : @entity167 could lose his job as @entity169 manager if they continue their dismal form it 's not too late to play @entity201 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there 's £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week …			1
