by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has been sensationally cleared of a physical assault on @entity5 ’s @entity4 after an @entity7 judge took just 10 minutes to throw out all charges against both players			1
@entity11 ’s insistence that nothing serious happened when @entity2 and @entity4 clashed at the bottom of the pavilion staircase at @entity15 during the first test was vindicated in highly embarrassing fashion for @entity5			1
@entity18 , the hardline @entity7 judge appointed by the @entity19 to hear the case , spent six hours listening to evidence from both sides by video link and was then expected to take up to 48 hours to reach his verdict			0
spat : @entity2 and @entity4 were embroiled in a row as they left the @entity15 pitch delight : @entity2 can not hide his emotions after dismissing @entity4 at the @entity31 yet in a development which left @entity5 both stunned and angry the judicial commissioner quickly decided there was no case to answer for either player			2
it was @entity5 who insisted on bringing a highly unusual @entity40 charge against @entity2 for ‘ abusing and pushing ’ @entity4 which left him facing a four - @entity44 suspension and expulsion for the rest of a series that @entity11 levelled in convincing fashion on thursday			1
they were adamant that @entity2 had crossed a line in making physical contact with @entity4 after the players had left the outfield at lunch on the second day of the first test , raising the stakes and forcing both sides to bring in lawyers			0
yet @entity11 ’s belief that @entity5 ’s provocative move was purely tactical to get their best bowler thrown out of the series was backed up by @entity18 ’s decision to clear @entity2 and uphold @entity5 ’s appeal against a fine levelled against @entity4			1
leader of the attack : @entity2 was man of the match in @entity11 's third @entity44 win at the @entity31 for fourth test vs @entity5 at @entity70 , starting on august 7 @entity71 ( c ) , @entity72 , @entity2 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 ( wkt ) , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82			1
@entity85 , @entity75 and @entity81 , the @entity11 players closest to the incident , were the main witnesses for @entity2 while @entity5 coach @entity86 , captain @entity87 and physio @entity88 were in @entity4 ’s corner			1
@entity2 , man of the match in @entity11 ’s 266 - run victory at the @entity31 , was said to be euphoric after having the potentially serious stain on his record which has been hanging over him during the last two tests removed			2
now , in a huge psychological boost , @entity2 will be free to play at his home ground of @entity70 in next week ’s fourth test after what @entity11 will consider almost as big a victory as the one they gained on the field in @entity102 over the last week			2
' i 'm not going to start judging @entity2 on everything he does and does n't do , " he said			0
' what i will say is that at the moment we celebrate the fact that he 's bowling at his best			0
' the whole test , he 's been great			0
but the spell he bowled on the last morning was a real masterclass of swing bowling			0
' ( it was ) on a pitch that was drying , had something in it - but his control of line , length and the decisions he made to put batsmen under pressure was outstanding			0

@entity2 found not **guilty** of @entity126 **offence** by @entity19
@entity11 *seamer* free to play at @entity70 and the @entity129
@entity5 all - rounder @entity4 also found not **guilty** of any **offence**
verdict was reached during six - hour hearing
@entity136 delighted to have @entity2 for rest of @entity139 series
