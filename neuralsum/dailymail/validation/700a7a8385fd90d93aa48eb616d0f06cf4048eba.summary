scientists have discovered a frog in @entity2 that can rapidly change its skin patterns to mimic the texture it sits on			1
spotted in the western @entity8 cloud forest , the creature is believed to be the first known amphibian to have this shape - shifting capability			1
researchers claim the ability to change skin texture to reflect its surroundings may enable the frog to camouflage itself from birds and other predators – but say this has yet to be proven			1
@entity31 spotted the spiny frog , which nearly the width of a marble , sitting on a moss - covered leaf			1
the @entity36 captured the frog , and nicknamed it ' punk rocker ' because of the thorn - like spines covering its body			2
the next day , ms @entity31 pulled the frog from the cup and set it on a smooth white sheet of plastic			2
it was n't ' punk ' - it was smooth - skinned			0
the new species , called @entity26 - or mutable rainfrog - was discovered by a @entity28 phd student and her husband at @entity30			0
this image shows how the frog changes from spiky to almost smooth in just over 300 seconds they assumed that , much to her dismay , she must have picked up the wrong frog			0
' i then put the frog back in the cup and added some moss , ' she said			0
' the spines came back ... we simply could n't believe our eyes , our frog changed skin texture			1
' i put the frog back on the smooth white background			0
' ' the spines and colouration help them blend into mossy habitats , making it hard for us to see them , ' she said			0
' but whether the texture really helps them elude predators still needs to be tested			1
' in this image , one of the frogs can even be seen sitting next to her transparent eggs , where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside this is the astonishing ' glass ' frog which manages to elude its predators with its see through skin - rendering it almost invisible			1
the @entity92 's @entity91 looks as if it is changing colour as it moves , as the background shows through its transparent flesh			2
the bizarre camouflage means you can still see its heart , intestines , and red blood vessels			0
photographer @entity101 snapped the frogs - with bulging yellow eyes - underneath leaves at a nature reserve in @entity105 , @entity106			0
in this image , one of the frogs can even be seen sitting next to her transparent eggs , where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside			2
during the next three years , a team of fellow biologists studied the frogs			0
they found the animals shift skin texture in a little more than three minutes			1
a separate research them at @entity120 , @entity2 , discovered that @entity122 sobetes , a relative with similar markings but about twice the size of @entity126 , has the same trait			1
because the appearance of animals has long been one of the keys to identifying them as a certain species , the researchers believe could mean many species have been missed .			0

*pristimantis* *mutabilis* was spotted in @entity2 's @entity8 cloud forest
it shifts its skin texture to match what it is sitting on in three minutes
this may to be *protect* itself from predators , but this is yet to be proven
