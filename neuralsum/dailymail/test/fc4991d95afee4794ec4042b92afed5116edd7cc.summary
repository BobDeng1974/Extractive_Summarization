who has been @entity1 ’s player of the season ? had you asked that question 12 months ago , the answer would have been glaring : @entity6			1
for his 31 goals and his breathtaking displays , the accolade could only have gone to the @entity10			0
it was not , though , a case of him operating alone			0
had it been a ‘ normal ’ season , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 would all have been worthy recipients			1
but they were not the only contenders			0
@entity23 was a big presence			0
@entity6 was clearly @entity1 's player of last season after the striker scored 31 goals in the campaign @entity14 ( left ) and @entity29 ( front ) also played well as @entity1 's title tilt fell short the @entity33 playmaker put in a real all - action display for his team			1
as well as scoring the winner , he had the most shots , most touches , the highest duel success , highest dribble completion , and the most tackles			0
fast forward to the present and ask the same question : who has been @entity1 ’s player of the season ? there is no obvious candidate			1
@entity22 , of course , would have his backers			1
the @entity51 international has excelled since the turn of the year , while @entity16 would command his share of the vote			1
@entity55 suggested after the @entity33 ’s fabulous goal against @entity57 on march 1 he might be a contender for @entity58 but , at times since , his flame has not flickered so brightly			2
@entity17 had three blistering months when his goals were key to reviving fortunes			2
@entity62 has caught the eye since @entity64 , while results have been better with @entity66 in the team ; @entity1 have only suffered three defeats in the 23 matches he has started			1
and that explains why @entity1 are where they are at the moment			2
there have been lots of satisfactory contributions , a few excellent , but there has n’t been anywhere near the consistency of 12 months ago			2
@entity22 has chipped in with some important goals and impressed with his boundless energy @entity16 has again played well and won the game for @entity1 to send them into the @entity84 semi-finals @entity16 has popped up with some important goals this season — five of his six strikes have earned @entity1 results ( four wins and a draw )			1
it is why they find themselves on the wrong side of the line for @entity98 places and why they have made such heavy weather of this @entity84 campaign			2
for long periods here they flattered to deceive			0
@entity17 saw little of the ball and @entity15 continued to show how out of form he is			2
the goals have dried up for @entity55 ’ side over the course of the last month — they had only scored seven in their previous six matches before this game			0
@entity55 must have feared the worst as @entity111 kept his side ’s @entity113 dreams alive with two stunning saves early in the second period , but then , much to his relief , up popped @entity16			0
there is still time , of course , for one of @entity55 ’ squad to emerge as the absolute best of this bunch ; on may 19 , a gala dinner will be held at the city ’s @entity125 when the successor to @entity6 will be announced			0
@entity15 's injury - hit season has been a tempestuous affair for the out - of - sorts striker @entity17 was denied of service at @entity132 during a frustrating display for the contract rebel at this moment , nobody is better placed than @entity16			1
if @entity1 are going to clamber into the top four — still a possibility given @entity1 ’s implosion — and win the @entity84 , much will depend on the little @entity33			1
he proved he had what it takes to settle a frantic collision at @entity132			0
@entity55 needs him to show that right through until the end of may .			0

@entity6 was @entity1 's player of last season
but who would earn that accolade this year ? @entity22 has many backers , as does @entity16
several , among them @entity62 and @entity17 , have shone in parts
there have been lots of *adequate* contributions but there has *n't* been anywhere near enough consistency
if @entity1 are going to clamber into the top four and win the @entity84 , much will depend on the little @entity33
