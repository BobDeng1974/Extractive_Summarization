@entity5 was meeting a client at the exclusive @entity7 in @entity8 during the recent heatwave			1
instead of a tea or coffee , he ordered three 500ml bottles of @entity13 - which typically cost 60p in supermarkets			1
it emerged the @entity7 - a five - star hotel which charges £ 600 a night for a suite - operates a minimum charge of £ 25 per person when using its bar after 4pm			1
