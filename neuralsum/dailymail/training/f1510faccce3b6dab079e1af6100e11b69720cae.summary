by @entity1 reporter on june 6 , 1944 , @entity2 launched the biggest seaborne invasion ever seen , @entity3 , as they attempted to overcome the @entity5 juggernaut that had conquered most of mainland @entity6			2
that attack , and the battles that followed , would see some of the fiercest fighting of the @entity10 brought to the coast and countryside of @entity13			0
here an incredible set of photographs shows those battlefields as they were then , littered with burned out planes , wounded soldiers and destroyed buildings , and as they are now , packed with tourists , sunbathers , and beach huts			1
packed with landing craft , tanks , trucks , soldiers and anti-aircraft balloons , it is difficult to recognise the beach near @entity30 , code - named @entity31 , when it is set against its serene modern - day counterpart , home to nothing more than a few walkers and a caravan			0
bottom : 70 years on in may this year , the beach near @entity53 is a haven of peace calmer waters : @entity41 troops are helped ashore after their craft was sunk by enemy fire at @entity31 — which is now a popular spot for sunbathers chaos of war : a crashed @entity41 fighter plane on the waterfront at @entity67 near @entity68 bears testament to the ferocity of fighting , where flags now fly prettily along the promenade watching history : residents look on as a @entity76 bulldozer clears the @entity77 after the battle for @entity79 — the church towers somehow survived the @entity49 bombing , but much of the city had to be rebuilt everyday horrors : the body of a dead @entity86 soldier lies in the main square of @entity88 near @entity31			1
today , the town is popular with families streets of change : a @entity13 tank gets a warm welcome passing through @entity95 — today the bombed building is a clothes shop sands of time : captured @entity86 soldiers at @entity100 , which was one of the first liberated towns			0

this year marks 70 years since @entity49 invasion of @entity13 in 1944 with *thousands* of troops landed in @entity106
here photographs show the incredible *transformation* of battlefields from the invasion to the present day
tanks are *replaced* by caravans while sunbathers relax where wounded troops were carried ashore by *comrades*
