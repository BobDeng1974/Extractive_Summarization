published : 16:17 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 06:02 est , 12 august 2013 the first time i tried to lure a robin to feed from my hand , i failed			1
my experience with wildlife is almost entirely based on mammals , and i was not convinced that your heart could easily be captured by a bird			2
perhaps my lack of commitment shone through as i stood near the specks of organic mature cheddar i had placed on the garden table , waiting for the robin , which seemed to glower at me from the nearby dogwood , to swoop down and accept my offering			1
@entity18 from @entity19 who has a @entity20 in his back garden that will eat from his hand the reason i was trying to lure him to my hand was down to robin expert @entity24 , whom i had met while writing my latest book , @entity26			1
i had challenged a number of wildlife gurus to convince me that their favourite species was equal to my own , the hedgehog			2
@entity24 , obviously , had opted for the robin			2
the challenge was life - changingly serious — i had rather rashly declared i would get a tattoo of the species to join the one of a hedgehog i already had on my left ankle			2
i have long held that the hedgehog is the most important creature on the planet			2
between its muddy little paws are held the keys to the salvation of humanity			2
this is because its behaviour allows us to get so close to it			2
while most wildlife flees or attacks you when you approach , the hedgehog just rolls itself into a @entity54 can be a profound experience coming nose to nose with a wild animal , and that ’s what you can do with a hedgehog			2
could i get as up close and personal to a robin ? wing and a prayer : like a jump jet preparing to land , the robin swoops in to retrieve its prize - a tiny piece of cheddar cheese say cheese : the bird ¿ s feathers fan out as it lands - and @entity18 's camera captures the image i was n’t confident — even though the @entity77 people ’s bond with robins goes back many years			1
elsewhere , the bird is hunted			2
but here , thanks to the way we garden , the robin has struck up a peculiar relationship with human beings			1
why ? because to the robin we are little more than tall pigs			0
in their natural habitat , the woodland edge , they follow wild boar , watching as they turn over the soil and expose food			0
and what do we do in the garden ? we weed and dig — and the robin hops along behind us			1
but the bond between man and robin is not just down to our pig - like behaviour			0
the robin does itself a lot of favours by being bold , bright and musical in the bleakest months			0
people have found you can tame robins to feed from your hand , which is what @entity24 had told me about			1
he learned the technique from his mother , who always had a ‘ pet ’ robin			0
last year , a recently fledged robin was tolerating my presence in the garden			1
and though i tried to lure it to feed from my hand , i failed			1
then , this summer , a bold redbreast , which i like to think is the same one ( though they have such short lives that might not be the case ) , appeared just outside the conservatory door			1
not expecting much , i took a few crumbs of cheese , put them on the table outside and waited @entity133 swooped , took a piece of cheese and was off again			0
i had just completed the first hurdle			0
a few minutes later the robin was back so i set up the next step — cheese on the table , but this time i stood closer , with my hand out			1
a little more hesitantly , the robin came closer , bounced around the far side of the table , before flitting across , pinching the cheese and disappearing down the garden with a thrumming of wings			1
fantastic flight : @entity18 took photographs to prove to friends that the magical connection with the robin really happened the next day , it was back , and this time i placed the cheese on the table , but with my hand nearby			1
again , more hesitation , but it came and grabbed another crumb of mature cheddar			0
later in the day , i heard the rapid flutter of wings and a little cheep			0
i decided to be as bold as the robin and placed the cheese on the tips of my fingers , with my hand on the table			1
hopping around , plucking up courage , the robin came close , before flying away without the treat			0
i realised i had been holding my breath			0
the next day i repeated the exercise , though this time with my camera in the other hand — at least , i thought , i would get a nice close - up of the bird			1
@entity179 , hop it came , closer and closer , then a dart forward			0
it took the cheese and buzzed off			0
i had completely forgotten to take a photograph			0
elated , i went back to the fridge for more cheese , and over the next three weeks we struck up an understanding — the robin will pose for a photograph on my hand for around 1/500th of a second in return for a piece of cheese the size of a grain of rice			1
apart from the neighbour ’s cat , my only worry for the bird is its cholesterol levels			0
i took the first photographs to show my doubting friends that the magical connection between the robin and me had happened			1
but then i noticed how beautiful the bird was , so i began to take out a camera with me every time			0
close - up and personal : the camera helped @entity18 see the minute details of the robin 's feathers snatch and grab : the robin darts away with the piece of cheese it has taken from @entity18 's hand when the robin hovered nervously to begin with , as it decided whether to come for the food or not , this gave me a rare view of the wings , trembling in mid air			1
as it became bolder , the wings seemed to look different because it flew in more directly , sometimes folding them back like a falcon			1
and then , when it was even more comfortable , i got shots of the great fan of feathers that make up the wing of this amazing little bird			0
sometimes it seemed to be dancing on my hand as it perched for a fraction of a second before darting away with its prize			1
the feathers around the face are so fine			0
without the camera , i would never have seen so closely what makes a robin special			0
i have been lucky enough to be able to share the delight — my wife , children and friends have all enjoyed moments of wildlife connection			1
one morning i was having a snooze in the conservatory when i was woken by a ‘ cheep , cheep			0
’ i looked down and the robin was hopping around my feet			0
i got some cheese and as i stood there , feeding the bird , it dawned on me that perhaps i had not trained the robin — it had trained me			2
perhaps i should consider that tattoo after all .			0

@entity18 has trained a @entity20 in his back garden to eat from his hand
he took photographs to prove to friends that it really happened
