details of a bizarre @entity2 plan to breed giant @entity4 rabbits in concentration camps to provide fur - lined clothing for @entity8 's armed forces has been unearthed in a @entity10 archive			1
' @entity12 ' , as it was known , was the brainchild of sinister @entity15 chief @entity14 who was had a career as a trained chicken farmer before he became the architect of the @entity19			2
he ordered a breeding programme for the rabbits and specified that they were to be raised in luxury just yards away from the where the most terrible crime against humanity was taking place			2
bleak : @entity28 prisoners at @entity2 concentration camp @entity29 , near @entity30 , which was the first camp to have a rabbit breeding station while prisoners were starved , beaten and tortured to death in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity29 , the rabbit hutches in these and 27 other camps camps were spacious and heated			1
the furry residents were also given a daily supply of fresh vegetables - probably more than the human inmates who were forced to tend them saw in a month			1
the idea was for the rabbits to produce enough fur to make lined coats for @entity49 pilots , cosy socks for @entity52 personnel and warm undergarments for the infantry in winter according to the @entity10 newspaper @entity55			1
the plans were detailed the ' @entity4 book ' which was discovered hidden at his home on the fringes of the @entity61 in @entity62 in 1945			0
keeping cosy : @entity14 's dream was to collect the rabbit fur in order to provide warm coats for @entity49 pilots and even socks for @entity52 personnel valuable : the @entity68 treated their @entity4 rabbits very humanely and considered them a valuable resource in their plan to protect their troops from the harsh cold of winter apparently he deliberately hid it there for fear that it would fall into enemy hands			1
it contains 150 photos of fluffy rabbits , some being cared for by concentration camp prisoners in their trademark striped ' pyjama ' uniforms			2
some of these inmates were even executed if their @entity15 overseers believed they were not treating their rabbit charges with enough respect			1
partners in crime : @entity14 , notorious head of the @entity92 , stands with @entity8 to observe a @entity2 parade in 1940 the breeding programme began in 1941 shortly after the @entity2 invasion of the @entity96			2
@entity14 got the idea for utilising rabbits for wool production after reading of a small - scale scheme that was started during the @entity101			2
he wrote at the time : ' throughout @entity104 it is my intention to establish breeding stations in concentration camps ' and even decreed that they should be kept in pens where they had ' plenty of space			1
' often their hutches were just yards away from barrack huts designed for 200 where upwards of 800 prisoners lived			1
in @entity29 , the first such camp and the one which became a model for all that followed , he ordered the cultivation of peppers which were intended to feed the rabbits			0
@entity14 , who was also obsessed with creating the perfect blonde , blue - eyed ' @entity129 ' master race of @entity10 , immersed himself in every aspect of the plan			0
but like many other @entity2 ideologies @entity134 plans failed to match up to reality			0
a chart in his book counted 6,500 rabbits by the end of 1941 and 25,000 by 1943			0
but by that year , when the project finally stopped as the war began to turn disastrously against @entity10 , the total amount of wool collected amounted to less than five tons			0
when the camps were liberated many empty hutches were found but the rabbits were long gone			0
@entity148 , one of the liberators of @entity29 near @entity30 himself ' liberated ' a fur - lined jacked which he found on a pile in a storeroom at the camp where 36,000 people were murdered between 1933 and 1945			0
he called it his ' bunny coat			0

starving inmates of concentration camps were forced to grow fresh vegetables to feed the ***animals***
some were even executed by the @entity15 for not showing the ***animals*** the proper respect
the brain child of @entity14 rabbit breeding programmes existed at *31* death camps
he *wanted* their fur for lined coats for the @entity49 pilots , cosy socks for @entity52 personnel and warm *underwear* for the infantry
***animals*** given heated hutches and ' plenty of space ' often just yards from where prisoners lived in *squalid* , *over-crowded* and *freezing* blocks
