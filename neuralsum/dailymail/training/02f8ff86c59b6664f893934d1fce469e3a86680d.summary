a few days before @entity3 ’s @entity2 squad flew out to @entity4 last summer , @entity0 made it clear that he expected to be given a run of games up front when he returned to @entity9			1
we are coming up to the anniversary of that conversation — which happened in the swanky resort of @entity14 do @entity15 in @entity16 — and nothing has changed , except his club			0
on sunday , wearing the colours of @entity21 in this @entity23 fifth - round tie against @entity24 , the forward was shoe - horned into this team			1
few could displace @entity27 on his current form			0
@entity0 ( centre ) was not played in his preferred central position in @entity21 's @entity23 victory the @entity32 forward misses a chance to add to his meagre goal tally of seven for the season @entity21 's main striker @entity27 scored both goals in the 2 - 0 defeat of @entity24 at the @entity38 @entity0 experienced similar difficulties at @entity9 before being shown the exit door instead , @entity0 is in familiar territory , forced on to the wing again because @entity27 , one of the most under - appreciated players at the highest level of the game , is scoring at will			1
in many ways @entity0 is a victim of his own versatility , squeezed out to the wing in this cup tie because @entity27 is a first pick for @entity52 when he is fit			1
@entity52 said : ‘ if you look at the history of my strikers , most of them have been able to play in different forward positions over the year			0
the only one who has n’t and probably has to play up front is @entity27 , but the rest have been able to play wide if necessary			0
’ in the days of @entity62 he could pop up wherever he wanted , but @entity0 is playing with more tactical discipline as he works his way into this team			2
against one of the best sides in the @entity67 , @entity0 started on the left and swapped with @entity69 to play on the right after the break			2
his afternoon ended when he was replaced by @entity73 in the 72nd minute			0
even though he is on the same pitch as some players with genuine pedigree — @entity69 , @entity77 and @entity78 operate at a different technical level from the others — this is not what he signed up to			0
@entity0 is competing with the likes of @entity69 ( left ) and @entity27 to become the main man at @entity21 @entity0 's versatility has often worked against him but his work rate is appreciated by all @entity0 's heat map against @entity24 showed that he struggled to get into dangerous positions - click here for more stats from our brilliant @entity92 service the 25 - year - old was eventually substituted for alternative winger @entity73 ( right ) after 71minutes @entity0 's finest moment in an @entity21 shirt came with a @entity99 hat - trick against @entity100 when he arrived from @entity9 at the end of the summer transfer window , @entity0 wanted to be the star of the show in an @entity21 shirt			1
instead , we are waiting for him to really get going			0
he touched the ball 38 times at the @entity109 on sunday , a long way short of the the 128 touches taken by the imperious @entity78 and his midfield partner @entity77 ( 116 )			0
if it came down to work - rate in the @entity115 , then @entity0 would win a place in this team every week			1
he has scored some goals , netting his first for the club in a 3 - 0 victory at @entity121 in september and scoring a hat - trick against @entity100 in a 4 - 1 win the following month			1
suddenly , though , he seems vulnerable			0
@entity21 manager @entity52 insists that his forwards often play in a variety of positions @entity0 will be hoping to progress in the same way that @entity62 ( left ) did under @entity52 's guidance @entity0 will not have a guaranteed place in the team when a number of stars return from injury despite being a favourite of @entity134 , @entity0 could find his @entity3 place under threat next month an @entity3 squad will be announced for the games against @entity139 and @entity140			1
@entity0 is coming under pressure from @entity142			1
he is a favourite of @entity134 ’s , but to keep his place in the team for club and country the forward will need to play in his preferred position			0
it seems that if @entity27 is fit , he will always start ahead of @entity0			2
the @entity151 has now scored 11 times in the @entity23			2
in a few weeks , as @entity21 power on for a place in the top four and another appearance in an @entity23 final , the competition will be fierce in this squad			1
heavyweights such as @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 will be making demands of @entity52 as they enter a crucial phase of the season			0
when that moment arrives , you begin to wonder where @entity0 will fit in .			2

@entity21 moved into @entity23 *quarter* - finals with 2 - 0 defeat of @entity24
@entity0 has failed to become the @entity32 ' star striker since arriving from @entity9
forward will be under pressure from @entity142 for @entity3 's next games
