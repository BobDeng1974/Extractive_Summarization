with a value of £ 1,250 , a tank that can hold 10 litres of water and a firing range of 40ft , it is said to be the world 's most sophisticated machine gun water pistol			1
engineer @entity8 , 27 , of @entity9 , south @entity10 , spent 50 hours designing and building the first - ever @entity12 - style water pistol from scratch - using 55 separate parts from everyday life			1
a black cab 's windscreen wiper provides its rotary motion and a walking pole handle makes the pump , with most of the parts fitted together using self - setting silicone rubber @entity22			1
‘ for example , i used a black cab 's windscreen wiper to provide the rotary motion of the pistol and laser cut mechanics to create an intermittent barrel rotation			2
‘ the windscreen wiper motor was ideal as they have a very high gearing and are easy to pick up cheaply second hand			0
‘ standard plumbing pipes and fittings were used wherever possible , so that as much of the pistol could be made from stuff in your local diy store			0
technology : @entity56 welding canisters are used to pressure two large fire extinguishers so the water can fire out long distances through the six barrels soaking : most of the water gun 's parts were fitted together using self - setting silicone rubber @entity22 @entity65 : different colours shoot out from the different barrels thanks to the added ingredient of small amounts of food dye ‘ combining @entity22 with existing parts , i was able to make custom valves , pistons and injectors integral to the @entity12 motion and colouring of the jets of water			2
’ ' i had to first break down the mechanics of how the @entity12 gun worked , and then build it up using a mix of all sorts of components ' @entity8 , engineer @entity56 welding canisters are used to pressure two large fire extinguishers so the water can fire out long distances through the six barrels			0
