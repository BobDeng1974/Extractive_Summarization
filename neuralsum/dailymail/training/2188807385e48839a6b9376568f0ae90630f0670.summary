by @entity0 published : 19:08 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 02:53 est , 7 december 2012 @entity1 : religion is so important for the pagan star @entity4 has revealed that she is a pagan and a believer ‘ in the trees ’			1
it is the first time the absolutely fabulous actress , who was raised a @entity10 , has spoken openly about her religious beliefs and spirituality			1
the 66 - year - old made the admission in an interview about @entity16 , a documentary examining the story of @entity18 and the flood which she will present for @entity21 this month			1
the investigation into the origins of the flood story , which features in the three world faiths – @entity26 , @entity27 – forced @entity4 to confront her own beliefs			1
‘ i think i ’m a pagan , but a believer in all			2
i kind of believe in the trees			2
do you know ? ’ she said in the interview with @entity31 magazine			1
‘ i think most of us are curious			0
which is why religion is so important to people			0
we all want to find out “ what ’s it all about , @entity41 ? ” before we book out completely			0
‘ i was brought up as a @entity10 – first in @entity42 , in a house which had all these masses of @entity46 images , in a country where @entity48 reigned – and then in the @entity49 where the call of the muezzin [ the @entity53 call to prayer ] was heard every morning			0
‘ i ’m a fellow traveller with all these faiths , but i have n’t got a personal tradition			0
‘ the message i would take from the story of the flood as @entity61 ’s punishment is that we are all responsible for behaving properly on the planet			1
look after it , because it could go badly wrong			0
’ @entity4 , who described herself as a darwinist and ‘ not a @entity66 ’ , revealed that she has had a lifelong fascination with the story of @entity18 and his @entity69 ‘ i have an idea that when a notion persists throughout the ages and across the globe , it probably contains some fundamental truth			1
it ’s not as simple as “ no smoke without fire ”			0
but on the other hand there ’s something about the timing of this , ’ she said			0
‘ there have been horrifying floods , some extraordinary climate changes , so now seemed as good a time as any to address the notion of a cataclysmic event			0
everything points to the fact that there was a flood alarming enough to be recorded in @entity92 history , which predates the main world religions			2
‘ so i think that human beings – who are responsible for pretty much everything we know in the way of alteration to the earth – probably made some sense , to their own ends , of a flood that really happened			2
’ @entity103 : what would @entity104 , played by @entity4 ( pictured ) , make of the actresses pagan views ?			1
