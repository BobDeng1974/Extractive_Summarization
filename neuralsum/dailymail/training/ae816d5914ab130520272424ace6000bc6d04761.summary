by @entity0 published : 16:08 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 20:35 est , 26 october 2013 @entity2 has revealed the heartbreaking moment she almost snatched a baby from her cot in a ‘ cold and frightening ’ state - run so - called orphanage in @entity7			1
the @entity9 author says her maternal instincts drove her to consider the unthinkable during a visit to the institution , which she claimed was more like a prison than a home			1
she says : ‘ i ’m an emotional person			2
i struggle with that a lot in this kind of situation			2
there was one little baby , a girl , and i was standing at this cot and i just thought , “ i will take her ”			1
emotional : @entity2 makes heart - rending confession in rare interview about her children 's charity @entity25 ‘ it was irrational but that ’s your human response			1
there was no earthly way i could take this baby home but that is your most powerful reaction			1
you think as a mother , “ i will save this baby , this one baby ”			1
’ @entity2 recalls the encounter in an emotional interview with @entity40 , editor of @entity41 , in which she also discusses the work of her children ’s charity @entity25 , named after a spell in the @entity9 novels			1
the mother of three also reveals that , despite being worth £ 560 million , she still worries about money - the legacy of once being a single mother living on benefits			1
@entity2 ’s charity has rescued thousands of children from filthy and inadequate care homes in some of @entity7 ’s poorest countries			1
they include orphans as well as those whose parents are no longer able to feed them properly			1
action : @entity2 has set up a children ’s charity , @entity25 , to help orphans in @entity7 the writer , who is planning to expand the work of the charity to @entity66 , has donated millions of pounds of her own money and made a series of ‘ secret ’ visits both to the orphanage she is trying to close and the replacement homes she has helped to build			1
in the interview , published in today ’s @entity74 , she also discusses the emotional toil her encounters have had on her and how she hopes to help a million children in @entity78 , the @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			1
she says : ‘ the one incident that absolutely killed me was a little girl with physical disabilities who had been put into the institution and used to ask for her mother			2
the nurse would go outside and ring the girl and pretend to be her mother			2
’ and @entity2 reveals how she came up with the charity ’s unusual name – the wand - lighting charm in @entity9			1
she says : ‘ @entity9 had been left in a very hostile environment , so there are clear parallels			2
he is a boy removed from his family by bereavement			0
’ the author speaks candidly about how her ‘ emotional anxiety ’ about money is deeply rooted in her past			1
‘ i still worry about money			0
funnily enough it bears no relation to what is in your bank account , it is purely emotional , ’ she says			0
‘ i was as poor as it ’s possible to be in this country			1
‘ i was a single parent			0
the key phrase is “ in this country ” because we have a welfare state			0
i remember not eating so my daughter would eat ... nights when there was literally no money , when i had one @entity123 biscuit and that was dinner			0
’ she adds : ‘ i was terrified of pressing the wrong button and losing everything , and having to look my daughter in the face and say , “ we had a house and now through a stupid error ... ” i do n’t know what i thought i was going to do but my terror was making a ridiculous mistake and it all disappearing			0
’ @entity2 - whose seven @entity9 books have sold more than 450 million copies between them - is now enjoying success with her two adult fiction novels , @entity140 and the @entity142 ’s calling			2
she was accused of being ‘ anti-middle - class ’ after her first novel looked at tensions between a sink council estate and the local town			0
but she explains : ‘ i ’m not anti-middle - class in the slightest			0
look at me ! i am very pro people putting time and money and effort into trying to improve the world			0
‘ and the middle classes do that very , very well			0
i would be the last person to deny that , being middle - class myself			0
’ the @entity9 author has welcomed the ‘ huge ’ improvement in the press ’s behaviour			1
@entity2 , who told the @entity162 in 2011 that her family ’s privacy had been invaded on dozens of occasions , said she no longer felt that she was being ‘ watched or followed ’			2
and she claimed it was unlikely that anyone today would be exposed to the ‘ tsunami ’ of media attention she endured at the height of her @entity9 fame			0
‘ in 1997 it was like the @entity174 , ’ she says in the interview with today ’s @entity74			2
‘ if @entity9 happened now , i ’d have a different experience			0
i have felt a change and it ’s been really welcome			2
‘ it has largely disappeared , those mysterious phone calls trying to get information out of you			0
it went on routinely and has fallen away , and thank @entity182 for that			0
’ she adds : ‘ certain things are n’t up for grabs			0
