but not for the rangers on one @entity8 's most rugged group of islands who have just started a once in every five year puffin count			1
@entity11 , the 10 intrepid inhabitants of the @entity13 off the @entity15 coast will spend the next three months braving nips and bites as they stick their bare arms down 80,000 burrows to check for inhabitants			1
the rangers put their hands down each burrow on the islands to find out the exact numbers of breeding pairs hands off ! @entity29 rangers will @entity26 and @entity27 laugh as they put their hands into @entity31 nests after years of growing numbers at the colony - one of the largest in @entity8 - the 2008 survey found the puffin population had plummeted by a third found you ! @entity29 ranger @entity26 holds a @entity31 during a census on the @entity13 as the birds mate for life and faithfully return the same underground den year after year , any signs of occupancy - including an egg , newly - laid bedding , or fresh guano - adds two more to the rangers ' tally			1
but inevitably there are occasions when the owners are home , and then it is not uncommon for blood to be drawn as the rangers ' come off worse in their exchange with the puffins ' sharp bills			2
after years of growing numbers at the colony - one of the largest in @entity8 - the 2008 survey found the puffin population had plummeted by a third compared to the previous census , from 56,500 to 36,500 breeding pairs			1
the count takes place every five years and dates back to 1939			0
the sudden decline in puffin numbers has baffled bird lovers @entity29 rangers @entity26 , @entity67 , @entity27 and @entity68 dig deep for evidence			1
any signs of occupancy - including an egg , newly - laid bedding , or fresh guano - adds two more to the rangers ' tally inevitably there are occasions when the owners are home , and then it is not uncommon for blood to be drawn as the rangers ' come off worse in their exchange with the puffins ' sharp bills numbers had dropped from 56,500 to 36,500 breeding pairs - so rangers are keen to find any evidence that numbers have increased the sudden decline baffled bird lovers , with some blaming overfishing of the @entity92 or pollution from oil and plastics			2
others feared that changing climate could be driving them away			0
on four of the eight @entity13 there was a dramatic decrease of up to 50 per cent			0
in recent years , the signs were that numbers had begun to steadily creep back up			0
the iconic @entity31 seabirds with their brightly colourful bills have returned in their thousands to the @entity13 @entity29 rangers will carry out a puffin census on the @entity13 which offer good protection for the birds to nest the @entity13 provide excellent sources of food and few ground predators but despite this rangers fear that the extreme winter could impact on breeding numbers a census is carried out every five years with the last one in 2008 recording 36,500 pairs of puffins but wardens now fear any gains will be wiped out by the worst puffin ' wreck ' for more than 60 years , which occurred in march			1
around 3,000 dead birds washed up on the north - east coast , amongst them one of the colonies oldest puffins , a 31 - year - old male			1
@entity128 , head warden of the @entity29 - owned @entity13 , said : ' we had seen some small increases in the past few years , so we were optimistic that numbers would be up			0
on four of the eight @entity13 there was a dramatic decrease of up to 50 per cent of puffins with 80,000 burrows needing to be checked by hand , the team will likely have lost of scars to show for their hard work in recent months dozens of puffins have been washed up along the @entity92 coast after succumbing to extreme weather conditions wardens fear any gains in numbers will be wiped out by the worst puffin ' wreck ' for more than 60 years , which occurred in march ' but with the recent extreme weather , and the puffin ' wreck ' claiming thousands of birds there will inevitably be knock - on , so we will just have to wait and see			1
' the count can be both the best and worst of the job			0
it 's great fun , but with 80,000 burrows needing to be checked by hand , the team will likely be sick of them by the end of the count , and have lost of scars to show for it			0
' the rangers are also hoping to re-introduce rabbits to the isles this summer , to graze the meadows where many species of bird make their nest - including eider ducks , razorbills and terns			0
around 3,000 dead birds washed up on the north - east coast , amongst them one of the colonies oldest puffins , a 31 - year - old male puffins can expect new neighbours , as rangers are hoping to re-introduce rabbits to the isles this summer some bird lovers blamed overfishing of the @entity92 or pollution from oil and plastics for the decline although rabbits like to burrow , they do not compete with the puffins , who will chase them out of their nests			1
for fans of the colourful little seabirds who are unable to make the journey to wild and windy @entity199 , the @entity29 have installed a camera in one of the burrows , showing the day to day activities of a pair of birds and their newly - hatched egg			0
they also have a ' puffin - cam ' on the island , which has been placed amongst the birds to capture up close footage			2
peekaboo ! a ' @entity212 ' from inside one of the @entity214 on @entity13 shows life inside a @entity31 nest @entity29 installed a ' puffin - cam ' on the island , which has been placed amongst the birds to capture up close footage fans of the brightly - coloured birds take pictures as they visit the @entity13			2

thousands of birds return to one of @entity8 's largest colonies in @entity15
a 2008 survey found the puffin population had plummeted by a third
extreme weather *believed* to have contributed to decline of puffins
