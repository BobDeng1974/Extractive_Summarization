a couple accidentally booked a cheap flight to the @entity2 from the wrong @entity3 - 4,000 miles away			1
@entity4 and his partner @entity5 were thrilled when they bagged two return flights to @entity8 for just £ 800			1
but when they arrived at the @entity12 hub , they were told their @entity14 flight was actually taking off from @entity3 - the biggest in the @entity16 state of @entity17			2
humbug ! the tickets were booked by 55 - year - old @entity4 , left , for himself and his partner @entity5 getaway : an @entity14 flight landing on the @entity2 island of @entity24			1
@entity4 and his partner @entity5 were devastated to discover their ' bargain ' flight was actually leaving from @entity3 , @entity17 mr @entity4 , 55 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , told @entity30 on sunday : ' the girl at the information desk broke the news with a very sympathetic look that our flight was leaving over 2,000 miles away			1
' we had no choice but to get our car out of long stay and drive home			1
' the pair are now on a bargain break in the @entity45 resort of @entity46 instead , the newspaper reported			0
despite the 4,200 - mile distance between them , the two airports have some surprising similarities			0
they are a similar size and both went into service around the same time - the @entity55 's version was commissioned in 1928 , while flights began at the @entity16 version in the same year			0

they are a similar size and both went into service around the same time - the @entity55 's version was commissioned in 1928 , while flights began at the @entity16 version in the same year it is not the first mix - up involving a @entity2 flight			0
just three months ago grandmother @entity77 , 62 , from @entity78 , fell victim to another namesake - except she ended up in the @entity2 by accident			0
as she sipped a gin and tonic at 30,000ft and looked forward to her break in @entity86 , @entity45 , a fellow passenger broke it to her that they were actually travelling to the island of @entity89			1
and it is not even the first mix - up between the two @entity92			0
in 2008 @entity94 chiefs were left red - faced after they distributed 720,000 leaflets praising @entity96 for their recycling - which showed the skyline of @entity3 , @entity17 , instead .			2

@entity4 , 55 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , booked tickets for just £ 800
