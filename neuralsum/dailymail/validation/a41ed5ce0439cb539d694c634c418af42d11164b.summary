@entity0 was a surprise home finalist at the inaugural @entity2 but his hopes of repeating the feat were killed off by @entity5 on thursday			1
the 29 - year - old surpassed all expectations in october 2013 , when @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 were among his victims , before @entity12 inflicted a 5 - 0 defeat on the @entity15 cueman in the title match			2
nudged back in the calendar to march this season , 50th - ranked @entity0 would have longed to put together another decent run in his home tournament , but the figure of world number eight @entity5 loomed large in the draw			2
@entity5 saw off @entity0 to deny the @entity15 a repeat success at his home tournament and @entity25 winner @entity5 came through a 4 - 2 winner to reach the last 16 , where @entity28 's @entity27 awaits him			1
former world champions @entity30 and @entity9 advanced , @entity32 winning 4 - 2 against @entity33 and @entity34 with a final - frame break of 127 to fend off one - time @entity37 king @entity8 4 - 3			1
next up for @entity9 is world number six @entity39 , who was given a scare by amateur @entity41 and was far from persuasive as he edged through 4 - 3			1
@entity39 has been struggling with a shoulder injury and even considered withdrawing from the tournament			0
@entity39 said after beating @entity41 : ' the shoulder is better than it was in my first match , though it is still not perfect			0
' i do n't expect much tomorrow , i will just battle like i did today and see what happens			0
i 'm not going to play my best here			0
i just need to try to be patient because i know i 'm going to miss balls that i do n't usually miss. ' @entity9 is hoping to hang around in @entity50 - because he is smitten by the local cuisine			2
@entity9 said , according to @entity53 's website : ' i 've had two curries a day since i 've been here			0
they are the best curries i 've ever had , better than anything back home			0
if my wife asks me next week if want to go for a curry , i 'll definitely have to say no. ' @entity60 , the 2006 world champion , breezed to a 4 - 0 win over @entity62 , with others through to the last 16 including @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 - the 22 - year - old @entity71 potter reaching the last 16 of a ranking event for the first time after a 4 - 1 victory over @entity75 .			1

@entity0 made the final at inaugural @entity2
but @entity5 beat him 4 - 2 to reach the last 16 this time around
@entity30 , @entity9 and @entity39 also all advance
