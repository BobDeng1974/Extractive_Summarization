by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 11 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:59 est , 11 february 2014 lawsuit : @entity5 's @entity4 is claiming more than $ 500,000 for privacy breaches a highway patrol trooper who caught another officer speeding to an off - duty job at 120mph is suing for more than $ 500,000 - saying his allies harassed her after he was fired			1
@entity13 's @entity4 made national headlines after handcuffing @entity16 officer @entity15 , while he was in full uniform and driving a police car			1
since the incident in 2011 she claims she has had threatening calls on her cell phone , police cars idling outside her house and fellow officers accessing her private driver 's license information			1
ms @entity4 - who is suing more than 25 police agencies - said she is even afraid to open her mailbox			1
other calls included prank calls and orders for pizza , she claimed			2
in a lawsuit she said law enforcement officers had long been known to band together and protect each other , but her case took things too far			0
according to her lawyer , she suspected her private driver 's license information was being accessed by fellow officers , so she made a public records request with the @entity42			2
it allegedly showed at least 88 law enforcement officers from 25 different agencies accessed @entity4 ' driver 's license information more than 200 times - in just three months			1
ms @entity4 is suing those police agencies and the individual officers under the federal @entity51 , a 1994 law that provides for a penalty of $ 2,500 for each violation if the information was improperly accessed			1
@entity57 ' attorney , @entity56 , said it was clear most of the officers had no legitimate reason to look up her data			0
if all the searches were found illegal , @entity4 could receive more than $ 500,000			1
' ultimately what it comes down to is a violation of privacy , ' ms @entity56 added			0
' it was n't for any legitimate purpose on the part of the police officers and it was done by people in a position of trust			2
he was later fired and she says his allies turned on her according to court documents , most of the individual officers named in @entity4 ' lawsuit did face some disciplinary action , usually a written reprimand			2
but lawyers for the agencies have asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit , claiming that under the @entity94 , @entity93 can not hold police officers liable for merely accessing the information - only if they try to sell it			2
some of the officers say they had a legitimate reason			0
a lawyer for fellow state trooper @entity101 said he accessed @entity4 ' information after ' hearing rumors that other troopers were threatening ' her , and that his actions were done ' out of concern for a fellow trooper ' and as ' a matter of public safety			2
' the challenge by some @entity13 police agencies to the driver 's license law has drawn the attention of the @entity115 , which is defending its constitutionality			1
' there is value in drivers ' information and a market for it , ' @entity115 lawyers said in court papers			0
' what the defendants fail to recognize is that there is value in drivers ' information whether or not it is actually sold			0
' ms @entity4 was on a routine patrol early in the morning in october 2011 when a @entity15 's car whizzed past at speeds that would eventually top 120 mph			1
even with her blue lights flashing and siren blaring , it took her more than seven minutes to pull him over			0
not certain who was behind the wheel , she approached the car warily , with her gun drawn , according to video from her cruiser 's dashboard camera - yelling : ' put your hands out of the window ! right now ! ' @entity15 apologized and said he was late for an off - duty job , to which @entity4 shouted : ' you were running 120 miles an hour ! ' @entity15 was eventually fired after the confrontation made national headlines			1
some police agencies are trying to change the driver 's license law to stop claims like ms @entity4 '			1
@entity156 , executive director of the @entity157 ( @entity158 ) , said law enforcement officials are concerned lawyers are using the law to target individual officers who access the information			0
speeding : ms @entity4 was initially unsure who was in the police car and approached with her gun drawn ' in our view , it was not what the federal law was enacted to counteract , ' @entity156 said			2
' i think it would be unfair and outside the scope of the legislation to think individuals would get whacked like that			0
' @entity158 is lobbying @entity93 to remove the automatic $ 2,500 penalty and change the law so that a violation could only occur if there was ' specific intent to secure an economic benefit , ' according to the organization 's documents			1
ms @entity56 said anyone can ask the @entity42 for a report - known as @entity187 , for driving and @entity188 - on who has accessed their driver 's license information and how many times , but it is n't easy			0
' you do n't even know you 've been looked up unless you make a concerted effort to find out , ' she said			0
a judge is expected to rule on the law enforcement agency and officers ' motions to dismiss the case in the next few weeks , which will determine whether the lawsuit continues			0
ms @entity56 said @entity4 , who had been assigned to road patrol in @entity204 , has relocated and is no longer driving a cruiser , but she still works for the @entity5 .			0

@entity13 trooper @entity4 pulled over @entity78 's @entity15 in 2011

since then she says officers have run illegal searches on her license
there were also alleged prank calls and police cars idling outside her home
she is suing police agencies and officers over the searches for $ 2,500 a time
