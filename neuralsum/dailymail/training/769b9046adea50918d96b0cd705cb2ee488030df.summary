" ' she explained how she embraced the ageing process , telling @entity7 , 60 : ' it 's a gradual thing and you get to learn about yourself and see yourself and start to live with who you are as you go			0
but after a brush with @entity34 's favourite face freezer left the something about @entity37 feeling disengaged with her own face ; the blonde beauty - still one of the highest paid actresses in @entity34 - made the tough decision to allow herself to age naturally			1
and on sunday , @entity2 - who landed a $ 40m paycheck for 2011 's bad teacher , which is way above the standard for leading ladies and twice what a male contemporary like @entity53 can command - opened up to @entity54 about taking a stand against ageism in society			2
she said that it is ‘ crazy ’ how women are under pressure to look like they are 25 even when they are more mature			2
@entity31 ban : @entity2 has been open about using the face freezing toxin and how she disliked the results refreshingly different : @entity2 has joined @entity66 in breaking ranks with the perennially youthful @entity34 crowd she said that women ‘ do n’t give ourselves permission to age gracefully ’ and that they are constantly told they have to ‘ defy nature ’			1
@entity2 herself has in the past fallen victim to the guilt she describes and has had @entity31 which she regrets as it changed her face in a ‘ weird way ’			1
she had a nose job after breaking it four times and has spoken about her battle with acne , revealing that she tried everything from makeup to medication to make it go away			0
@entity2 said : ‘ for me i feel like if i - it is almost as if we have failed if we do n't remain 25 for the rest of our lives			2

it is a personal failure			0
like our fault that at 40 years old that i still do n't look like i 'm 25			2
’ arguably , it ; s @entity2 's determination to grow into her own face that 's ensured she 's stayed at the top of the @entity34 casting tree , certainly her lucrative bad teacher role relied on her ability to mug it up in a way the @entity31 queens just ca n't			1
her latest role , as @entity118 in the remake of @entity120 alongside @entity121 and with @entity122 as the titular star , involves similar comedy			0

’ @entity2 agreed with @entity54 that everyone 's trying to be ‘ back there , ’ in the past			0
she said : ‘ women do n't allow other women to age gracefully , and we do n't give ourselves permission to age gracefully , everybody ’s judging			1
’ @entity2 , pictured aged 26 in her breakthrough role in @entity142 , spoke about how women feel they have somehow failed if they do n't look like they are in their 20s @entity2 , who has just released her lifestyle guide @entity126 , gave the interview weeks after @entity66 spoke out about how she ‘ wanted to die ’ when she put on weight in her 20s			1

in a frank interview she also said that years later she suffered a relapse and teared up in the bathroom with a bottle of wine as she told herself : ‘ i ’m not coming out until i can totally accept the way i look			0
’ now and then : @entity2 said on monday she stopped using @entity31 , which may be why she looked so smooth back in may ( right ) last year passion for push ups : though the @entity162 has often been spotted post work - out , as she is here in may , she insisted she is n't a gym rat			1
