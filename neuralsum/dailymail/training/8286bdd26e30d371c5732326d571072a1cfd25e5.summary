by @entity1 reporter published : 17:01 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 18:48 est , 18 december 2012 having built a giant dalek last @entity7 , @entity4 fans @entity2 and @entity5 wondered how they could possibly go one better this year			1
the answer was this 10ft festive version of the @entity10 , which almost touches the ceiling of their home in @entity13 , @entity14			0
they used 150,000 bricks – all of which must be put away in the right boxes come @entity20			2
standing tall : miss @entity2 with the 10ft mascot , which took 150,000 bricks and two months to build mr @entity5 , 54 , and @entity24 , 49 , spent two months building the giant @entity10 , which is the latest in a long line of creations over the past 20 years			1
they spent more than 70 hours constructing the giant mascot , complete with @entity30 costume , which is now standing in their living room			0
miss @entity2 said : ' we started building it in mid-october and we ’ve spent at least an hour a day working on it			2
' we watched the @entity36 in the summer and we enjoyed it so much we decided to use the mascot for our theme this year and add a @entity7 coat			0
' we had a soft toy wenlock which we used to design the model and we added an fc instead of a @entity42 on his head			0
' the couple and their children @entity46 , 20 , @entity49 , 17 and @entity50 , 14 , have been building huge @entity4 models at @entity7 for the last two decades			1
early days : the family have been making @entity4 models each year since @entity46 ( pictured left with sister @entity49 , right ) was a baby , including this snowman built in 1995 travelled afar : @entity46 , left , @entity49 and baby @entity50 with a @entity4 model of the @entity58 in 1999 over the years the models have become increasingly complex , including last year 's @entity60 , left , and the @entity61 , right , built in 2005 it 's that time of year again : in 1996 the family built this @entity7 sleigh they started the year @entity46 was born and a family friend came to visit with a young child			1
miss @entity2 said : ' i got my old box of @entity4 out for the toddler to play with but the pieces were too small so the adults ended up playing instead and we built our first @entity7 model			1
' since then the models have got bigger each year and the family has built a @entity7 stocking , a @entity7 , an angel , a snowman , choirboys and a giant dalek			2
hark the @entity82 : the family 's skills had clearly developed by the time the @entity4 angel was built in 2006 , right , and the three choirboys in 2003 growing up : the three children in front of the 2001 model of a @entity91 @entity7 market they now have a huge collection of @entity4 , much of which they have bought from @entity94 , and it is all stored in the cellar			1
miss @entity2 said : ' on the twelfth night after @entity7 we invite friends round and have a packing away party as all the pieces need to go in the right boxes			0
' it can take around two weeks to put all the bricks away again			0
' dedication : each year the family has built an impressive model , including this large mansion created in 2000			0

@entity2 and @entity5 used 150,000 bricks to build model
