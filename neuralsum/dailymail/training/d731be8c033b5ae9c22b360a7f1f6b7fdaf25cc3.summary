by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 17:45 est , 26 november 2013 ' nuts ! ' is a word often heard by defeated players on court at the @entity5 , home of the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8			1
but this little fella must have thought something similar as he was caught in a crossfire of tennis balls as he scampered across the court ... almost as fast as one of @entity17 's serves			0
play began in the first day of the @entity6 tennis championship with familiar faces all taking part for a shot at the title , the squirrel amongst them			1
it only goes to prove that hare - brained ideas do n't just come from the players			0
it seems this nutty animal wanted to beg , burrow or steal a seat at the @entity6 , come what may ! perhaps in - training for a career in animal acting , the squirrel waited until the cameras were rolling to enact its daring move ... in an interview , when asked what the squirrel was thinking about , he simply responded : ' @entity60 ! ' regular visitor : it 's not the first time the squirrel has been seen darting across the court at @entity65 nutcase : the squirrel may well have the best seat in the house , but is in danger of being hit by low flying objects traveling at almost 100mph ... and we 're not talking about nuts !			2

game , set and nuts : @entity76 stole the show as it ran across the court on day one of the @entity6
the most suicidal of moves has shot the squirrel to stardom
furry friend seems to make a *yearly* *appearance* at the championship
