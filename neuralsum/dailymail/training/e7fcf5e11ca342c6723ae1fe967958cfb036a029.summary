by @entity0 moving portrait : chancellor of the exchequer @entity0 tells the story of his great - uncle and grandfather as dusk fell at 6pm on march 21 , 1918 , @entity5 , a 20 - year - old lieutenant in the @entity6 , was killed			1
he was shot running across the @entity9 , in @entity10 , in a last - ditch attempt to reinforce his battalion ’s right flank and stop it being surrounded by advancing @entity15 soldiers			1
it was certainly the last time he was seen alive			2
my great - uncle ’s body was never found			1
he was billed as ‘ missing ’ , and it was not until a full year later , in march 1919 , that his distraught family put a notice in their local newspaper , the @entity25 , accepting he had died and would never return			1
@entity5 was killed after almost two years on the @entity27 , and at the end of a long , desperate day of fighting that had started with gas shells raining down on his trenches at 5am			1
all day the fighting had raged , as wave upon wave of enemy troops pushed the @entity6 further and further back			2
it was the first day of the great @entity15 @entity37 of 1918 known as the @entity37 , or @entity38 , that was designed to deliver the decisive blow that would end the war in the crucial months between the exit of the now - revolutionary @entity42 and the arrival in strength of the @entity45			1
after the initial breakthrough , the @entity15 advance continued for a further seven days and 16 miles until , having over-run the town of @entity50 , they reached the @entity51			2
there , the @entity52 were the latest group of exhausted @entity54 soldiers who had been ordered to try to stop them , and had hastily dug some trenches in @entity56 , on the other side of the river , from which to mount their defence			2
there was bitter fighting , and the @entity52 were pushed back through the wood – but they managed to hold on			2
the @entity15 advance ground to a halt – and it was the furthest point that the spring offensive reached			2
the man who helped to command those troops in that final defensive was @entity5 ’s brother , major @entity0 – my grandfather			1
sadly , i never met my grandfather			1
born in 1894 , he was a quiet professional soldier from @entity73 who , before @entity74 , had already been wounded twice in action and mentioned in dispatches			2
family history : @entity5 , a 20 - year - old lieutenant , was killed in the @entity37 in 1918 , the same battle where his brother @entity79 – @entity0 's grandfather - commanded troops that day , in 1918 , he was to win the @entity81 for his bravery			1
during my childhood , his silver @entity81 with its white and purple ribbon and ‘ @entity86 , 1918 ’ engraved on the back , stared down at me from a display case in my home			1
alongside it sat the large bronze memorial plaque that commemorated the sacrifice of his younger brother			2
it was one of 1,335,000 such plaques , or a @entity97 as they were called , that were issued			0
i have always looked at the two sets of medals and wondered at the fate of war			0
one brother lives , is decorated for his bravery ; goes on to have four children and dies many decades later			0
the other is killed as a youth and the only trace he leaves behind is a bronze medallion , a long - faded memory and a name , engraved among countless others on a memorial in the @entity114 cemetery in @entity115			1
if the trajectories of the enemy bullets had been ever - so slightly different , then my great - uncle would have lived and my grandfather would have died – and my father , my brothers and i and my children would never have lived			1
for me , like so many other families , there is nothing abstract about the @entity125			0
and it is not just the scale of the slaughter that has struck me			0
it is the sheer randomness of who lived and who died			0
a few weeks ago , i went again to visit the battlefields of @entity10 with my children			0
i defy anyone who stares at row upon row , column upon column , arch after arch of the names of the dead on the @entity143 , or the @entity144 in @entity145 , not to at least ask again the question : what could possibly justify all this ? what did my great - uncle and the other 32 young men from his small village in @entity73 die for ? @entity5 was killed trying to prevent the final @entity15 effort to win the war – an effort that failed thanks to his sacrifice and courage , the courage of my grandfather and of many , many others			1
attack : the @entity37 , or @entity38 , that was designed to deliver the decisive blow that would end the war in the crucial months between the exit of the now - revolutionary @entity42 and the arrival in strength of the @entity45 it is difficult to appreciate now – because we know the outcome of the war and all that followed – that those fighting it did not know that @entity54 and its allies would win , even by 1918			1
indeed , faced with the relentless @entity15 onslaught that spring , @entity174 sir @entity173 issued a plea to all troops that said simply : ‘ with our backs to the wall and believing in the justice of our cause each one of us must fight on to the bitter end			0
’ so these battles mattered in a war where the outcome mattered			0
when the commemorations for the centenary of the @entity125 were first being discussed , there was a risk that the reason we fought the war would be forgotten			1
there is always the temptation to present it as nothing more than a bloody struggle between rival empires ruled by rival royal cousins			0
thankfully , we have , as a country , resisted that simplistic interpretation			0
@entity54 was , for all its imperfections , a democracy seeking to preserve the rule of international law on the @entity206 and resist @entity15 militarism			0
we know the far - reaching consequences of victory for @entity54 , and the transformation it brought to everything from our attitude to war itself to the role of women			1
we also know the peace did n’t last			0
but that does not make it a conflict without any purpose			0
what is unknowable are the even more far - reaching consequences for @entity54 had we lost			2
we do not know what our country would look like today – but it is difficult to believe it would be a better place ; in all likelihood it would be very much worse			0
so i do not accept that @entity5 and all his comrades died in vain			1
and then there is the impact on the living			0
some years ago , with my father and his brother , i went to explore @entity86 and to see where their father had won the @entity81			0
there is no sign or memorial to the struggle there			0
this was not @entity245 or @entity246 ; just another forgotten skirmish among thousands of others			0
we parked the car by the side of the road , walked into a little copse by the side of the ploughed fields , and it was as if we had been transported back nine decades			0
there , in the wood , apparently undisturbed except by the passage of time , were remnants of the barbed wire , the shallow trenches and the shell holes where my grandfather fought and survived			1
' i doubt my relatives who fought in @entity10 would have imagined it possible that a century later their offspring , and offspring 's offspring , would be marching through those woods and honouring their memory , ' writes chancellor @entity0 there , by the side of the fields , was a row of unexploded @entity15 shells , exposed by the latest ploughing , that had been fired to kill him			1
and there too was the companionship of the @entity0 family , almost 100 years later , brought together in remembrance of part of our own personal history			1
last month i took my own children to visit the same area			0
i doubt my relatives who fought in @entity10 would have imagined it possible that a century later their offspring , and offspring ’s offspring , would be marching through those woods and honouring their memory			2
i doubt ten years ago that we would have thought it likely that thousands of our schools , our newspapers and broadcasters , and the public at large would take such a close interest in the centenary of the @entity125			0
i ’m sure that the courage of @entity54 soldiers in @entity301 and @entity302 has reminded us all of the sacrifice those in uniform make to keep us safe			0
in an age when we worry about the fragmentation of our national identity , this centenary has reminded us not just of our shared past – but of the ties that bind us still			0
it was that nation , and those ties , that @entity5 and @entity0 fought for			1
i already knew the story of my decorated grandfather			2
but the story of my great - uncle ’s last day on @entity318 is only known to me because of the work of people living in the village of @entity322 , in @entity73 , where @entity5 and @entity0 grew up			1
there , a group of fellow citizens have devoted a huge amount of effort to researching the stories of the 33 men from the small parish killed in that war			2
they wrote to me earlier this year , enclosing the research they had done on @entity5			1
i am hugely grateful to them , not just because they honour his memory and sacrifice , but also because they have enriched my life , filled in for me part of my family history and connected me with the sacrifice of men who gave everything so that we could enjoy our freedom today			0
may the courage of @entity79 never be forgotten			0
may lieutenant @entity5 rest in peace			1
and may all who fought and died for our freedom in that almighty struggle be honoured again this year .			1
