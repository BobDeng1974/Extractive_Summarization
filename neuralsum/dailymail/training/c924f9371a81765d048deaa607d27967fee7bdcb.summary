sir @entity0 is open to the idea of a showdown between the best cyclists on the planet , but stopped short of accepting @entity6 's challenge for the four best riders to contest all three @entity8 in 2015 for one million euros			1
the eccentric @entity9 would like to see @entity10 , who rides for his @entity11 , @entity13 's @entity12 , @entity15 's @entity14 and @entity16 of @entity18 race in the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 in the same year			1
the one million euros ( £ 788,966 ) purse could be divided equally , or be awarded as a prize to the rider who places best at the @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			2
@entity12 , of @entity28 and @entity13 , leads @entity10 during the @entity29 sir @entity0 is open to a showdown , but stopped short of accepting @entity6 's € 1 million challenge @entity6 owns @entity11 , the team @entity10 rides for , and wants a € 1 million @entity32 @entity13 principal @entity0 , speaking at the leaders in @entity35 conference in @entity36 , said : ' i like the attitude , i must say			1
i think we 'd all agree that seeing the best riders slug it out across the season at key races is what everybody would want to see			0
' if you could bring an added element to it of a bit more of a narrative throughout the season rather than just a one - off race then i think i 'd be behind that			0
' i think it 's all about getting the best riders racing together in the best and biggest races			2
' many cycling fans are relishing the @entity58 , where the quartet are expected to meet to contest for the yellow jersey won by @entity14 in 2014			0
the route of the @entity19 , announced earlier this week , suggested a @entity62 double might be possible , but few riders ride three @entity8 in a calendar year , let alone contest for the overall victory at them			1
@entity12 ( centre ) pictured riding during the second stage of the @entity70 @entity71 of @entity28 leads @entity12 through @entity72 during the @entity73 ' from a performance point of view , it 's quite a serious undertaking , ' @entity0 added			2
' but , from a conceptual point of view , i 'm sure from a fan 's point of view , from a sporting point of view , i think it 's got a lot of merit			0
' there will be concerns a sport which has endeavoured to tackle the use of performance - enhancing drugs will be leaving itself susceptible to abuse if such a gruelling challenge is contemplated			0
@entity6 called for his gruelling idea to be adopted in an interview with @entity93 newspaper @entity35 and then took to @entity94 to ' call out ' @entity10 's rivals publicly , including addressing @entity96			1
@entity6 wrote : ' @entity97 dont be a chiken ( sic ) ! # @entity99 ' @entity0 will reserve full comment on the suggestion until the @entity20 route is announced in @entity103 later this month			1
' until we get all the information , it 's going to be a pretty difficult one to judge , ' he said .			0
