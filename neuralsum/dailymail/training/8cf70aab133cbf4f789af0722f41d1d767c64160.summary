it looks like it started off with a curious critter hoping to make a friend and play in the snow , but as these pictures show , the the invitation was harshly rejected			1
these two voles were captured fighting tooth and nail , tumbling through the ice and snow with their claws at the ready			1
it appears one of the voles did not take lightly to the other entering its territory on @entity20 , @entity21 , and a fight ensued			1
tooth and claw : these two voles ended up locked in a fierce battle after starting a squabble in the snow they 're even cute when they 're angry ! as hard as you try to find them scary , it 's impossible furry fury : the bigger vole appears to scream in pain , as the smaller one bites down on its back , taking friendship ( and snowmen ) firmly off the cards unwilling to share its space , the enraged rodents were then seen tumbling in the frozen fields of @entity20			1
@entity21 wildlife photographer @entity44 , cape upon the altercation whilst out on a walk near his house on the island			2
despite being known for their timid nature , the voles paid no attention to @entity44 as they brawled in the snow			2
@entity44 said : ' i was walking near my house when i noticed some movement in the snow			0
' after taking a closer look , i noticed the voles wrestling , grappling and chasing one another			0
' moment of suspension : the two voles tumble through the snow , hardly noticing that they fall of a ( tiny ) cliff kung - fu skills : as they land , the smaller vole throws the other off its back , continuing the fight it all started so nice ... a tiny vole peaks around a snow - covered rock on @entity20 , @entity21 ' do you wan na build a snowman ? ' he approaches the other vole , an innocent expression on his tiny face ' no. ' the other vole is clearly not a @entity82 fan , and is not interested in construction of humanoid snowsculptures of any kind ' there was a small hole nearby that would be a perfect shelter for a little vole so i think they were fighting for territory			1
' i also know that these fights become more commonplace in the winter as food and shelter become harder to find			0
' mice owners never house males together as they will often fight but in the wild it 's a different story			0
' the fight looks very cruel but rarely is a vole severely injured , it normally ends with one of them surrendering and escaping			0
' it was very hard to keep track of them as they move so quickly , i believe this happens in the wild a lot but it is rare that someone gets the chance to photograph it			0
