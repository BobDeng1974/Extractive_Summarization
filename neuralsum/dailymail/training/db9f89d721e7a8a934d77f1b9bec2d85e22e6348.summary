@entity1 striker @entity0 says they have 10 days to get their season back on track			1
last season ’s title pretenders have had a poor season so far with new recruits struggling to gel and the injury to @entity11 proving more damaging than expected			1
but @entity0 , who figured in recent defeats by @entity13 and @entity14 , believes the international break can help @entity1 put right their wrongs ahead of a visit to @entity18 on november 23 , the site where their title challenge ended last season			1
@entity0 applauds the travelling @entity1 support after the defeat by @entity13 last week @entity0 - who started up front in @entity25 - takes on @entity13 midfielder @entity26 at the @entity27 @entity28 consoles a tearful @entity29 at @entity30 last year as @entity1 's title dream ended @entity0 , who remains a january target for @entity33 and @entity34 , said : ‘ the feeling here is that we have 10 days to work hard and focus on ourselves			1
‘ we can work hard on what we need to do to improve and take that into the game against @entity18 and then @entity41			1
‘ we ’ve got to focus on the positives and return to winning ways			2
we need to find confidence and belief , focus on us first and be really concentrated on what we do			2
we need to just pass all the rest because that ’s how you perform well			2
talking to @entity50 , he added : ‘ we played better [ against @entity14 ] than we had in the previous league games			2
but to lose 2 - 1 is obviously a disappointment			0
we ca n’t be happy about a loss in the league , especially against one of the contenders for the league and one of our rivals			0
‘ but there are positives - the way we played and the way we started the game , which was a lot better than what we did in the games before that			2
@entity69 international @entity0 trains at @entity1 's @entity71 training ground earlier this month @entity0 holds his jaw as he is helped to his feet by @entity13 defender @entity74 ‘ but we lost three games in one week and when you lose three times you become tired of losing			1
now it ’s actually [ going to be ] easier to get up and fight because you want to win and you want to show that the winning mentality is our mentality			0
’ @entity0 , 23 , has worked hard to make an impression despite it appearing his @entity83 career was over in the summer			1
‘ i think that when i was called upon to play , i did well against @entity13 or against @entity14 , when we were down and we needed to chase the game , ’ said the @entity84			0
‘ against @entity86 , we were at 0 - 0 and we needed to change the game			0
so it ’s not an easy way to get in , but it ’s good to be involved and i hope i get more [ chances ]			0
‘ in training i work hard every day , so i ’ve got the game rhythm every day			0
so it ’s easy for me to get into the game , like i showed against @entity95			0
i had been out for six weeks and then i came in and played 90 minutes and was fine			0
’ @entity11 - who hopes to return at @entity18 next weekend - watches the defeat by @entity14			1
