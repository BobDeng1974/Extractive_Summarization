chancellor @entity0 has flown in the face of mounting rage at @entity4 's decision to award it boss a £ 1million bonus by claiming that it ' could have been worse for the taxpayer '			1
to widespread fury , the taxpayer - owned bank awarded its chief executive @entity11 a bonus worth £ 963,000 , more than many ordinary workers earn in a lifetime			1
while the bank insists it has shown restraint - claiming its chief executive was ' entitled ' to £ 1.5million - the decision has become a lightning rod for public disgust at the culture of rewards for failure			1
bonus : @entity4 's @entity11 was given £ 1m , despite a catalogue of failures and his decision to axe 3,500 jobs , but the decision was defended by the chancellor @entity0 , right clear criticism is raining down from all corner ; labour leader @entity30 ; @entity32 mayor @entity31 ; @entity34 governor @entity33 ; @entity36 foreign office minister @entity35 , trade unions and taxpayers watchdogs			1
however , @entity0 , speaking at the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41 , came out in defence of the decision			0
he excused the government of blame but then claimed the £ 1m award was value for the taxpayer			1
' i ’ve always said that levels of pay across banking and financial services are too high , ' he said			0
' but this pay for @entity11 - the bonus - was set by the board of @entity4 under the arrangements that were put in place by the previous government , and of course @entity11 was the person brought in to sort out the mess at @entity4 after it collapsed			1
' i think the important point for people to understand is that the alternatives would have been worse for the taxpayer			0
' either there would have been a much larger bonus , of the kind he would have got a few years ago			0
' or the @entity70 would have had to take over complete ownership of @entity4 and over-ruled the board , and i think that would have cost the taxpayer more as well			2
away days : @entity0 's comments came while speaking at the @entity39 , which is taking place in the @entity41 ski resort of @entity40 ' i understand people ’s frustration about levels of pay across the banking sector , but the alternatives , when it came to @entity11 ’s bonus , would have been worse for the taxpayer			1
' @entity4 , which received a £ 45 billion state bailout , has seen its share price slump by 40 per cent , giving the taxpayer a paper loss of billions of pounds			1
@entity0 's comments come just days after ministers announced a crackdown on executive pay and @entity94 said a seven - figure sum for mr @entity11 would be unacceptable			1
the prime minister said rewards for failure made ‘ people ’s blood boil ’ when – in the words of @entity33 – hard - up @entity99 were suffering ' a ferocious squeeze '			2
but @entity94 has been placed in a very difficult position , not just by @entity0 's inflammatory comments , but also by criticism today which has come from within the coalition government			1
speaking on @entity110 's @entity109 , @entity36 foreign office minister @entity35 said @entity111 had earned more in three days than a soldier serving on the frontline in @entity114 would earn in a year			1
angry : @entity94 said that the rewards for failure make people 's ' blood boil ' while @entity36 minister @entity35 , right said @entity111 had a duty to refuse the bonus , which is more than a soldier earns a year '' i think he should reflect on that , ' said mr @entity35			1
' he is working for a company which is five sixths owned by us , the taxpayer , and i think he has to think like a public servant , not like someone who 's there to line their own pocket			0
' he needs to think like a public servant who has a duty to his country , not just his own wealth			0
' ' no - one 's forcing him to take this money			0
he could struggle on with £ 1.2m			0
' @entity94 is now facing pressure from within the coalition to back up his rhetoric with action			1
labour leader @entity30 seized the opportunity today to pressure @entity94 , saying that the pay award showed the prime minister had failed to live up to his rhetoric on executive pay and shareholder activism			1
' it 's a disgraceful failure of leadership by the prime minister , ' he said			2
' he ’s been promising for months action against excessive bonuses , executive pay , and now he ’s nodded through a million - pound bonus			0
pressuring the pm : @entity30 , left , said the pay award was a clear failure of leadership from @entity94 while @entity31 said he was ' at a loss ' to explain the size of the bonus ' he ’s also been lecturing shareholders about how they need to be more active in holding executives to account			1
' he owns , through the @entity70 , 83 % of the @entity4			0
' he must now explain , not least to the @entity99 people , why he has allowed this to happen			0
' @entity32 mayor @entity31 joined the condemnation , saying he was ' at a loss to justify ' the scale of the payment			2
protest : a man wearing a ' fat cat ' suit stands outside @entity4 in @entity32 , with a cigar yesterday as the bank met to decide on the bonus he said he had sympathy for mr @entity11 and wanted an end to ' incessant banker - bashing '			1
but he went on : ' i find it absolutely bewildering because @entity4 occupies the same status in the economy as @entity180 did in the @entity181 : it ’s a state - owned bank			2
' the idea that this is not in the control of the government seems to me to be far - fetched			0
' protesters from civic campaign group @entity187 are due to gather at the @entity4 headquarters in @entity32 later to call for bonuses to be dropped			0
trade union leaders have also vented their anger at the size of the bonus , pointing out that millions of public sector workers were facing a pay freeze and lower pensions as well as job losses			2
@entity198 , @entity199 national officer , said : ' what planet does @entity11 and his banking chums live on ? ' taking almost £ 1 million from taxpayers ' pockets as a bonus is utterly disgusting and offensive to every working person across the country			1
how can a @entity4 senior banker who is responsible for sacking over 21,000 workers be rewarded in this way ? ' @entity212 general secretary @entity211 said : ' ordinary people facing the biggest squeeze in their living standards for decades and businesses desperate for credit will not understand why mr @entity11 should get such a huge bonus			1
' the government has been lecturing public servants about how they must accept a pay freeze and a big increase in pension contributions			0
they seem to have made an exception for @entity99 's best paid civil servant			0
' @entity227 , general secretary of the @entity229 union , said : ' a bonus of nearly a million pounds looks to ordinary people like he has won the lottery - with a ticket they paid for			0
' @entity235 , spokesman for the @entity237 campaign , said : ' @entity111 's bonus at state - owned @entity4 is a small step in the right direction but nowhere near enough			1
criticism : sir @entity33 said it would be wrong if rewards go to a small elite earlier this week , while @entity212 leader @entity211 said the government 's lectures on pay freezes clearly do n't apply to @entity111 it is believed any payout to @entity111 would be in shares rather than cash , and deferred for three years			2
senior government sources said they were satisfied mr @entity11 ’s bonus , which was £ 2m last year , had been cut and insisted he had to be paid well or be lost to a better - paid job in the private sector			1
@entity256 , an analyst at @entity257 , agreed and argued that the real test of @entity111 's pay is how much he could earn somewhere else			2
sir @entity260 , chairman of @entity4 , said the bonus was fair , adding : ‘ a safer and more valuable @entity4 is in the interests of our customers , shareholders and the @entity99 economy			2
‘ we are progressing well toward this goal under the leadership of @entity11			2
’ but @entity111 ’s bonus is just the first of many for staff at a bank in the process of laying off 3,500 employees			1
the bank fell slightly short of its target for lending to small firms under the government ’s @entity277 initiative to get credit flowing through the economy , critics argue the @entity277 goals are faulty as they measure banks ’ ‘ capacity ’ to lend – the money they make available in theory			0
small firms claim the banks have hiked up loan charges and fees , deterring businesses from taking up the funds			0
under the terms of @entity277 , @entity4 and the country ’s other four biggest banks pledged to lend small and medium - sized firms £ 76billion in 2011			2
between january and september , this should have seen them hand out £ 57billion – and they fell £ 1billion short			0
@entity298 said @entity4 , which is 83 per cent state owned following its bail - out in 2008 , was ‘ the worst culprit by far ’ among the banks			0
@entity4 earlier this month announced a further 3,500 job losses in its investment banking operation , on top of 2,000 announced previously			0
the bank has shed around 30,000 staff in the past two years , 22,000 of them in the @entity99 .			0

chancellor flies in the face of widespread anger over £ 1m bonus awarded to @entity4 boss @entity313
@entity36 foreign office minister @entity35 said @entity111 earns more in three days than a soldier serving in @entity114 would earn in a year
criticism from inside @entity319 puts @entity94 under pressure to act
@entity30 claims the award is a clear ' failure of leadership ' from the pm
@entity31 says he is ' at a loss ' to explain the size of the bonus
bank claims it showed ' restraint ' as @entity11 was entitled to £ 1.5m
