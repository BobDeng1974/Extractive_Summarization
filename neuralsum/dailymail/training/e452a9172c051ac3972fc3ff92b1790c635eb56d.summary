and the glamorous princess @entity17 found the act rather distasteful and chose to feed both her children , @entity20 and @entity21 , by bottle			2
will she ? wo n't she ? recent @entity4 tradition - and her own very modern outlook - suggest the @entity24 will choose to breastfed her new baby son			2
but in the past many @entity4 mothers chose not to indeed , it ’s only in the last century that the @entity28 have even considered natural feeding as an option			0
