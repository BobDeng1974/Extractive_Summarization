by @entity0 published : 21:38 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 03:40 est , 25 february 2013 it was meant to be a tribute to some of the hardest working women in film			2
during his opening monologue at the 85th annual @entity8 , host @entity6 took a moment to elaborate jokes that showed his bad taste , including a tune titled ' we saw your boobs			1
' the @entity17 comedian got the ball rolling with a self - effacing opening monologue that predicted he would go down in history as the worst host ever of the prestigious awards show			0
he quickly brought up one of the most contentious choices by the @entity8 this year to not nominate @entity41 for best director , despite getting nods in all other top categories -- and @entity46 's win at the director 's @entity47			1
' the film is based on classified @entity51 files ...			0
the story was so top secret that the film 's director is unknown to the academy , ' @entity6 joked			1
the stage is all his : critics predicted the @entity17 creator 's humour may be tough to swallow but then things turned sour as @entity6 tried to inject some humour into a line about the violent @entity65 western @entity64			1
' this is the story of a man fighting to get back his woman , who 's been subjected to unthinkable violence -- or as @entity70 and @entity71 call it , a date movie			1
' the energy in the room cooled as the crowd laughed nervously , forcing him to reply with an assurance that the joke was ' as bad as it gets , if it makes you feel better			0
' back from the future : @entity82 , dressed as @entity83 , comes from the future to save the show ominous prediction : @entity82 shows seth a title from a newspaper the next day ' oh no , that 's what we were afraid he would do , ' he said , mimicking the audience 's response			0
he followed it up with another diss at @entity65 's film -- which he later won an award for @entity99			0
talking about the film 's controversial overuse of the n - word , @entity6 drew silence from the crowd when he joked that the screenplay was ' loosely based on @entity107 's voicemails			1
' ' what , now you 're all on his side ? ' he asked , clearly showing that he is uncomfortable with @entity111 a few boos , he replied with a promise that ' it 's really not as bad as it gets			0
' in interviews beforehand , he had spoken of his hope to strike a balance between respect for @entity120 and some necessary sass			0
@entity122 accomplished , as even critics from @entity124 lauded the actor			2
' loving that @entity127 is attempting to preempt his # @entity8 criticism , ' the magazine posted on their @entity131 account sunday			1
song and dance : @entity82 then shows a clip from the show in which @entity6 sings a song titled ' @entity137 ' stifled laughter : his song is met with mixed emotion but before he can continue on his downward spiral , @entity6 is interrupted by @entity82 dressed as a time travelling @entity83 , a role he made famous on the @entity144 television series			1
@entity82 immediately criticizes the handsome funnyman in an attempt to stop him from ' destroying the @entity8			1
' ' the show 's a disaster			0
your jokes are tasteless and inappropriate and everyone ends up hating you , ' @entity82 forewarned			0
he then showed @entity6 a copy of a newspaper headline from the day after the awards that read ' @entity6 worst @entity8 host ever			1
' not amuzed : @entity157 looked agitated in the pre-recorded bit when he mentioned her role in monster we saw her boobs : @entity164 drew looks from the audience in the skit horrified : @entity164 's face nearly went pale as she played along with the joke playing innocent , @entity6 tries to defend himself and asks what he did wrong			1
with that , @entity82 plays for @entity6 a pre-taped production number featuring the comedian singing and dancing to a crude tune titled ' we saw your boobs			1
' the melody showcases @entity6 's singing prowess as he 's backed by an all men 's choir			1
@entity183 mention : @entity184 was also mentioned in the spoof , and she gave a thumbs up the song , which oft repeated the titular phrase , called out actresses in the audience that have exposed their chest in some of their most famous roles			2
playing along with the joke , @entity164 looked horrified when he mentioned her name			0
next , @entity157 bowed her head low and avoided the camera at the mention of her breast - exposing performance in @entity161			0
but the always jubilant @entity184 relished at the nod , giving a glad hands up to the cameras			0
musical theme : there were many musical breaks during the show , many of which @entity6 partook in though it was clear the women were looped into the pre-recorded piece , the reaction from the internet was mixed			1
and in a matter of moments , # @entity216 became a popular hashtag on @entity131 and @entity6 was one of the trending topics on the micro-blogging site			2
television host @entity223 was quick to show his support for the comedian			0
' this is unbelievably , unacceptably , gob - smackingly , hilariously inappropriate			0
@ @entity228 ' @entity229 also threw in some praise : ' if you 're hating on @entity6 , just remember : he 's got @entity232 up there dancing			2
' @entity234 : @entity6 sang @entity235 's @entity236 as @entity237 and @entity157 took the stage stunning performance : @entity240 later told @entity157 she was a ' beautiful dancer ' on the other side of the fence , celebrity blogger @entity241 was one of the most vocal critics of the performance			1
' that song @ @entity228 did made me wish he just stuck to telling mildly funny jokes ! # @entity8 , ' he wrote			2
in an effort to change the course of history , he used the remainder of his 15 minutes to redeem himself , starting with a sensual dance by @entity157 and @entity237 to his rendition of @entity235 's @entity236			0
' not good enough , said @entity82 , who then revealed a video clip where @entity127 , costumed in a @entity256 habit , hit on @entity8 nominee @entity257 in the green room			2
stage presence : he did a musical number with @entity261 and @entity262			0

critics were mixed as @entity6 tried to stay on his best *behaviour*
called @entity267 a ' date movie ' for @entity70 and @entity71
*attacked* the @entity8 for *snubbing* @entity46 as director of ' @entity41 '
