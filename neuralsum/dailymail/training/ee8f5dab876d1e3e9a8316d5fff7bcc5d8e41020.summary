@entity0 is unlikely to get too giddy over the fact that the @entity2 will sit proudly alongside the @entity3 at @entity4 this season			1
the @entity6 is too long in the tooth to pay much attention to pre-season tournaments and the pots they provide			0
of far more importance to @entity12 will be the way his team fought back in @entity16 ’s @entity15 to claim an unlikely , and some would argue undeserved , victory over old rivals @entity18			0
it means that @entity20 fly home on tuesday morning unbeaten on their five - game tour of @entity23 and yet to taste defeat under the new manager			1
no mean feat when the opponents have also included @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			0
subs : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82			0
goals : @entity32 ( 55 ) , @entity47 ( 57 ) , @entity54 ( 88 ) booked : @entity69 ( 52 )			1
@entity18 : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity43 , @entity87 ( @entity88 74 ) , @entity89 [ captain ] ( @entity91 62 ) , @entity92 ( @entity93 62 ) , @entity94 , @entity95 ( @entity96 77 ) , @entity97 ( can 62 ) , @entity98			1
subs : @entity67 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104			2
goal : @entity89 ( 14 , pen ) attendance : 51,104 that scenario appeared unlikely when a @entity18 side who were on top for two thirds of the game went ahead through @entity89 ’s penalty			1
however , two goals in three minutes from @entity32 and @entity47 turned the game on its head before substitute @entity118 added a late third			1
perhaps more significantly , he was handed the captain ’s role that he craves at @entity20 for the first time under the new regime			2
@entity125 will not paper over the cracks for @entity12			0
@entity20 were poor at times here and he will be concerned at how his 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 formation was exposed by the excellent @entity98 in a game that was every bit as competitive as we had hoped			1
a thunderstorm of almost @entity135 proportions on sunday night and more torrential downpours throughout monday may have been to blame for a disappointing turnout which was well below expectations			0
@entity139 , for one , must hope that was the reason and not an abject lack of interest for soccer in @entity144 as he prepares to pump millions into a new franchise in @entity16			0
the weather would have left many pitches under water but the surface was in remarkably good condition at kick - off , such is the quality of the drainage system here			0
they still do n’t have a roof on the @entity15 , though , which is just too bad for spectators			0
one up : @entity89 is congratulated by @entity94 ( right ) and @entity97 ( left ) after scoring ahead : @entity89 slotted home @entity18 's first goal from the spot early in the first - half contrast : @entity20 players look to regroup after the penalty as @entity18 celebrate in the background cynical foul : @entity67 brings down @entity98 early on to give away a penalty in @entity16 no way : @entity67 pleads his innocence after giving away the penalty early on in @entity16 this , remember , is the same venue where @entity173 ’s @entity172 warm - up against @entity174 was held up for 20 minutes last month because of thunderstorms and lightning ; and the same stadium where @entity98 and @entity68 were sent off for an ugly confrontation when @entity180 ’s side had met @entity181 met three days earlier			1
any chance of another ding - dong between the two disappeared inside eight minutes as @entity68 went off injured – curiously he had been omitted from the line - ups broadcast on tv beforehand – and replaced by @entity69			0
the change also meant that @entity72 switched from left to right			0
as well as he has played on tour , @entity72 does not offer the same defensive protection as @entity68 and @entity20 discovered that to their cost five minutes later			2
ca n't believe it : @entity32 walked off with an embarrassed look on his face after the ' goal ' out : the ball clearly hits the stanchion before bouncing out towards @entity32 to slot home @entity98 had already caused them enough problems down the left flank when he pushed the ball past @entity67 inside the penalty box			1
@entity67 is not the quickest of centre - backs , nor can he always resist the temptation to dive in , and on this occasion it cost his team a penalty			1
the way he and his teammates protested showed just how much this game meant to them , but it was the right decision by referee @entity216 even though @entity67 got the slightest of touches			1
after that , there was never any doubt @entity89 would beat @entity222 from the spot			2
in fact , @entity18 should have had another penalty in the 34th minute when @entity67 ’s poor pass played @entity66 into trouble			2
@entity97 laid the ball to @entity98 and the fact that @entity70 clearly fouled him with his second attempt to tackle the winger was somehow missed by the match officials			1
@entity233 wants reinforcements judgement : @entity12 looks on from the dugout as his first season with @entity20 nears @entity238 : @entity32 attempts a free - kick for @entity20 in the first - half in @entity16 , but it hits the wall popular tourists : @entity20 have been the main attraction in the @entity23 over the past two weeks @entity20 ’s best chance in the first half arrived as early as the fifth minute when @entity38 slid in to turn @entity72 ’s outswinging pass back across goal and @entity87 ’s last - ditch clearance denied @entity32 an almost certain goal			1
@entity18 had the best of it , though , and @entity94 headed over from a great position when @entity38 could only help @entity89 ’s freekick into his path before @entity95 brought a fantastic save from @entity63 down by his near post			2
they continued to threaten after half - time and could have scored another two within five minutes of the restart			0
this time it was @entity70 ’s turn to put @entity47 under pressure with a poor pass			2
he was easily dispossessed and @entity89 squared the ball to @entity97 whose finish from 10 yards lacked conviction			1
piling in : @entity38 , who missed a sitter early on in @entity16 , loses out to @entity43 in the second - half focus : @entity70 passes the ball under pressure from @entity18 midfielder @entity94 in front : @entity20 midfielder @entity47 looks to get to the ball ahead of defender @entity43 moments later , @entity95 again exposed @entity67 with a pass in behind the @entity20 defender and @entity98 cut inside only to see his effort deflect wide off the heels of @entity66			1
so you could understand the sense of shock when @entity20 suddenly struck back with two goals in three minutes			0
it was difficult to tell which was better , @entity38 ’s cross or @entity32 ’s finish , when they got the first			2
the @entity284 picked out his teammate ’s run with a quite wonderful ball to the back post			0
there was still plenty of work to do from a tight angle with @entity43 in close attendance , but @entity32 watched the ball all the way before guiding it back across @entity84 and inside the far post with his left foot			2
unfortunate : @entity68 ( right ) came off early on after injury for @entity20 for @entity69 denied : @entity38 sees his effort from distance blocked by @entity18 captain @entity89 pivot : @entity20 midfielder @entity72 turns away from the attention of @entity86 if @entity18 could feel slightly aggrieved at being pegged back , they were positively shocked to fall behind to @entity47 ’s strike moments later			1
there seemed little danger when @entity69 played the ball into the @entity310 20 yards from goal but @entity47 took advantage of poor marking to turn and shoot			1
@entity87 spotted the danger too late and only succeeded in applying a vital nick which left his goalkeeper wrong - footed			0
@entity20 thought they had grabbed a bizarre third in the 65th minute when @entity72 ’s booming effort from the left touchline had @entity84 backtracking towards his own goal			1
in fact , the @entity320 keeper was in the side - netting by the time it landed inches over the bar but then rebounded back off the frame of the goal			2
hefty : @entity72 goes in hard on @entity86 as @entity20 looked to get a foothold in the game in behind : @entity98 slips the ball past @entity67 as the midfielder looks to build an attack clothes line : @entity67 then hands off @entity98 to the face as the young winger looked to accelerate ever the predator , @entity32 was lurking to guide home the loose ball but the furtive glance and wry smile gave something away long before the error was spotted on television and the goal chalked off			1
there was nothing wrong with @entity54 ’s effort in the 88th minute though			0
@entity350 was involved , racing down the right and crossing into the @entity18 box			0
@entity73 miscontrolled but it only teed the ball up for @entity54 who took one touch before rifling a shot past @entity84			0
no doubt the scoreline flattered @entity20			0
but @entity12 has been brought in to win , and so far that is all he has done			0
turning in : @entity32 pivots inside under the attention of @entity18 defender @entity43 finale : @entity20 and @entity18 line - up before the game surrounded by firework smoke @entity366 : @entity32 and @entity89 lead the teams out at the @entity15 in @entity368 soaked : the rain had hit the @entity15 in @entity16 hard before kick - off for the final			1

@entity67 brought down @entity98 early on , with @entity89 converting
it was @entity89 's tenth goal against @entity376 , more than any player
@entity32 equalised for @entity20 early in the second - half with a cute finish
@entity47 's deflected effort put @entity0 's side ahead *shortly* after
*confusion* in the second - half as @entity32 slotted home after the ball seemed to hit the crossbar
the goal was intially given , but replays clearly showed the ball hit the stanchion and was out of play
the *linesman* then *instructed* the referee to rule out the goal
@entity118 rounds of victory with fine finish late on
