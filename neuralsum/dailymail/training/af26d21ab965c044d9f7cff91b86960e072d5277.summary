my job is to encourage people to pray			2
' the mosque was so full at times , there would be people outside in the wind and rain praying			1
' i knew i could n’t just let this happen - because i would be abandoning what the @entity39 teaches us about how we should treat our neighbours			0
' when i spoke to people at the church about the situation , someone actually said to me this was not our problem , but i had seen it with my own eyes , so it was a problem			1
@entity22 said : ' they were out there praying and the snow came on for the first time in winter , it was really hard to watch			1
' when they were doing the prayer they had their hands and feet exposed and they were sitting on on the pavement , which is very rough			0
' you could even see them breathing because it was so cold and i think when i saw that , the visual impact was such that i just could n't walk past			0
' it felt wrong , mainly because the church is next door , it 's a big building and it remains empty on a friday lunchtime which is when they need the place most as that 's when they are at their busiest			1
' we had something we could offer and they were just standing out in the cold and i said to my congregation " we need to do something "			0
' @entity22 said he wanted the move to help build bridges between @entity83 and @entity6 after some initial resistance from his congregation about the move			0
he said : ' it 's a move that is so basic and fundamental			2
it has nothing to do with religion - it 's all based on human need			2
' the religious divide should n't divide us as people			0
' but i anticipated there would be some opposition as it 's strange and new and there was some natural anxiety in the beginning			2
' but once people realised that there is more commonality between us			0
' i certainly hope , wish and pray that this will help relations between the two religions			0
' when i spoke to the imam there was some hesitation on their part too , because this has never been done before			2
' but they took us up on the offer and it has been a positive relationship			0

dr @entity139 said : ' it would be good to think we can change the world			1
' most of us most of the time feel we ca n’t so do n’t bother			0
' but sometimes , someone has a vision we can do something of global significance on a local scale			0
' this is what is happening between @entity8 ’s and the mosque in its grounds			1
' everyone can do something locally and if more were to do so then something big might just begin to happen globally			0
' dr @entity139 said that the ' eyes of the world ' were now focused on the two faiths represented in the building on the city ’s @entity169			2
