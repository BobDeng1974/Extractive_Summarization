the group became stranded in @entity7 , @entity8 , when the gully they were in quickly filled with water as the tide came in - with a solid 5ft swell washing through			1
they huddled together on a rocky platform near a deep cave on the beach but were at risk of being swept off - and as it was too dangerous for them to try to leave the gully , lifeguards were @entity20 down for video of the rescue got you : @entity25 crew rescue one of the nine people trapped on a gully on a beach in @entity8 yesterday pointed out : @entity25 lifeguards are seen approaching as one of the stranded victims ( circled ) waits for help on rocks the conditions meant neither lifeboats nor paddleboards could be used , so lifeguards had to swim each member of the group to safety			1

mr @entity41 said : ‘ because of the shape of the gully and the size of the swell , it was impossible to get the inshore rescue boat ( @entity54 ) or even the rescue board in close enough to pick up the casualties so the only way was to swim in			2
‘ @entity58 and @entity43 swam in with rescue tubes , and communicated with @entity46 and @entity47 who were standing off in the @entity54			0
they could see when a set of waves was coming through so we could time our exit in the lull between sets			0
on board : the three adults and six youngsters aged between seven and 12 were at @entity7 in @entity70 help : the conditions meant neither lifeboats nor paddleboards could be used , so lifeguards had to swim each member of the group to safety ‘ we swam two children out first , with a dad who was helping another child			0
' it was a very difficult and long process , made even worse by the time pressures of the incoming tide and a building swell ' @entity41 , senior @entity25 lifeguard ‘ we dropped them off at the beach 15 metres ( 50ft ) away and returned for the second group			2
' we repeated the process with the other three children and one of the adults who was a stronger swimmer helping one of the children			0
