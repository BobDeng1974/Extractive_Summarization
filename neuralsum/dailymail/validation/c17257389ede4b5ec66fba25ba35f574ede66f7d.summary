if this was the last - chance saloon then @entity0 was the life and soul of the party with a standout performance as @entity7 's @entity6 drew 1 - 1 with @entity8			1
the @entity10 right back , 24 , is said to be fighting for his future at @entity12 after struggling to impress manager @entity13			2
he has made just nine appearances this term and was an unused substitute for the 2 - 1 @entity18 defeat to @entity19 on monday after being left out of the squad altogether for the previous two matches against @entity22 and @entity23 - despite overcoming injury			1
@entity0 impressed for @entity7 's @entity25 against @entity8 at @entity12 on tuesday @entity0 was an unused substitute during @entity7 's @entity18 quarter - final defeat to @entity19 on monday @entity0 was @entity7 's star performer in their 1 - 1 draw against @entity8 's @entity28 at @entity12 @entity0 is congratulated by @entity7 team - mate @entity29 after scoring the eqauliser on tuesday but he showed no sign of rustiness in the kind of all - action display that has seen him become a cult hero at @entity12			1
in a first - half in which he , unlike fellow senior @entity36 , rarely put a foot wrong @entity0 brought the house down with a delightful goal			0
with @entity7 trailing to @entity44 's neat opener , the defender intercepted a throw from @entity8 keeper @entity46 , chesting it down before clipping a delightful lob over the same man from 30 yards with his left foot			0
it brought a youthful house down - and was a timely reminder of his attacking talents in front of a watching assistant manager @entity56			0
@entity7 assistant manager @entity56 ( second left ) and @entity58 @entity57 ( third left ) watched on in the stands @entity62 's misplaced back pass on monday night saw @entity7 crash out of the @entity18 @entity7 are understood to be open to offers for @entity0 with a number of clubs in his homeland said to be leading the charge			1
but pressure will be growing on current incumbent @entity62 after his poor performance in monday 's 2 - 1 home @entity18 quarter final defeat to @entity19			2
@entity0 will have done his cause no harm , although remaining on the field for 90 minutes would not appear to be a good omen			0
