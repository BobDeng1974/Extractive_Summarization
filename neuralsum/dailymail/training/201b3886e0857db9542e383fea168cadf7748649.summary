ms @entity7 said stunts are an ' excuse ' for her to push her limits and ' find out what is possible ' ms @entity7 uses her breasts like a hammer to crush a stack of beer cans lined up along a bench ms @entity7 shows off her bruised hand and the brick that injured her when she broke it with her fist the stunt woman covers her eyes and braces herself as a friend prepares to shoot her with a pellet gun something which has probably helped her avoid serious injury			2

' but ms @entity7 is never deterred : ' pretty much everything i attempt someone tells me it 's too dangerous or not possible			0
leaning back , ms @entity7 opens her throat as a friend slowly places a sword into her mouth in freezing conditions ms @entity7 goes outside in just shorts and a bikini top and rubs snow on her body ' for things i know that no one will want me doing , i usually do n't tell them about it till after i am done shooting			2
