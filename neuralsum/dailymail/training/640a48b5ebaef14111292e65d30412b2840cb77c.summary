by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:54 est , 10 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:12 est , 10 december 2013 a father - of - two died after suffering brain damage when medics failed to diagnosed and treat his severe ear infection			1
@entity7 , 31 , died at the @entity8 in july 2010			1
his life could have been saved by a simple course of antibiotics , it was later concluded			0
@entity7 ( pictured with his wife , @entity13 , and their sons , @entity16 and @entity17 ) , 31 , died after he developed a severe middle ear infection which was misdiagnosed as a less serious outer ear infection mr @entity7 went to the hospital with his wife , @entity13 , on july 24 , 2010 , suffering from a severe ear ache , vomiting , dizziness , light intolerance and a fever			1
instead of being seen by an @entity26 doctor , he was referred by the receptionist to see a nurse at the walk in centre on the hospital site			1
the nurse wrongly diagnosed him as suffering from an infection of the external ear canal and sent him home with ear drops			2
had he been seen by an @entity26 doctor , he would probably have been correctly diagnosed with a more serious middle ear infection			1
as the infection was not properly treated , it spread from his ear to his brain and caused irreversible damage			2
after leaving the walk in centre , mr @entity7 ’s condition deteriorated further and he was drifting in and out of consciousness			2
his wife called an out of hours gp service and @entity49 but was not instructed to take him back to hospital			0
on july 26 he suffered a fit at the family home in @entity53 and was rushed to hospital by ambulance			0
mr @entity7 went to the @entity8 suffering from an ear ache , vomiting , dizziness and a fever			1
rather than being seen by an @entity26 doctor , he was sent to the walk in centre on the hospital site to see a nurse who misdiagnosed him meaning he did n't get the life - saving treatment he needed at this point he was finally diagnosed with an infection of the middle ear and underwent an operation to remove the infected bone and tissue			1
however , the treatment came too late and he died on july 30 of brain damage and swelling caused by blood poisoning as a result of an acute infection of the middle ear			1
@entity77 admitted that had mr @entity7 been seen by a doctor on july 24 , it would have resulted in him being given antibiotics , which would have treated his ear infection and prevented his death			1
@entity77 has now agreed to pay an out - of - court settlement to the family for the failings in mr @entity7 ’s care			1
mrs @entity86 , 33 , mother to the couple ’s two children , now aged eight and seven , said : ‘ @entity7 was taken from us and he should never have died			0
he will miss watching @entity17 and @entity16 grow up and we will always wish he was still here with us			0
‘ knowing @entity7 would have survived and been fine if he was given the correct treatment makes it even harder to come to terms with , but i am at least thankful the @entity77 has finally admitted it was their fault , it 's a little bit of justice for @entity7			2
‘ despite this , since @entity7 ’s death , we have never once had an apology from the trust which leaves me questioning whether improvements have been made and whether they are serious about improving patient safety			0
mr @entity7 would probably have survived if he had been correctly diagnosed and given antibiotics sooner ‘ i do n’t think it ’s a lot to ask for given i have lost my husband and two little boys have lost their dad			1
‘ i need to know that changes have been put into place to ensure this wo n't happen again to another family			0
people deserve a thorough examination by an appropriate medical professional , and this should be common practice			0
’ following an inquest into mr @entity7 ’s death at the end of 2011 , a coroner recorded a narrative verdict , saying that although he had died of a middle ear infection - a natural cause - there was evidence that vital signs had been missed which lead to a misdiagnosis			1
deputy coroner @entity130 went on to ask for a review of procedures relating to the treatment of ear infections at the walk in centre on the @entity8 site			2
@entity138 , a medical law expert at @entity141 ’s @entity140 office , said : ‘ this is a truly tragic case that has left two little boys without a father and @entity13 shocked and devastated by the sudden loss of her husband			0
‘ it is obviously very difficult for the family to come to terms with the fact that had @entity7 been referred to a doctor and given a simple course of antibiotics to treat the ear infection , he would in all likelihood still be alive today			1
mr @entity7 died at the @entity8 of brain damage and swelling caused by blood poisoning as a result of an acute infection of the middle ear ‘ instead , the family now have to live with knowing that more could have been done to prevent @entity7 ’s death and obviously no settlement can make up for that			1
‘ we believe that diagnosis of ear infections can be difficult even for experienced doctors and it should not therefore be a diagnosis that nurses are asked to make without assistance			0
we do not believe that they should be put in that position			0
‘ we are keen to see confirmation from the @entity77 about what training and procedures have been implemented to ensure the same errors can not be made again and protect patient safety			0
’ dr @entity179 , medical director at @entity77 which runs the walk in clinic , said : ' we would like to extend our apologies and condolences to mrs @entity86 and her family			2
' @entity185 took over management of the walk in centre in april 2011			0
we carried out a thorough review to understand the circumstances surrounding this tragic event and ensure that any learning for the service and its staff was quickly identified and implemented			0
' these included tightening protocols around the assessment and treatment of otitis media and otitis externa [ ear infections ] , providing additional staff training around ear infections and working to ensure all consultation notes are comprehensive and detailed			0
' @entity185 apologises unreservedly for the failings identified in mr @entity7 ’s care			2

@entity7 went to the @entity8 on july 24 , 2010 , with a severe ear ache , vomiting , dizziness , light intolerance and a fever
rather than being seen by an @entity26 doctor , the receptionist sent him to see a nurse at the walk in clinic - he was diagnosed with an outer ear infection
in fact , he had a more serious middle ear infection requiring antibiotics
he declined and was rushed to hospital where the infection was diagnosed
had surgery to remove the infected tissue and bone but it was too late
he died on july 30 , 2010 , of brain damage and swelling caused by blood poisoning as a result of an acute infection of the middle ear
@entity77 admitted that if mr @entity7 had been seen by a doctor *initially* , he probably would have survived
