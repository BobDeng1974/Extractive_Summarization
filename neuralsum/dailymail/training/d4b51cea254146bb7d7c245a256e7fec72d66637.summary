by @entity0 for the @entity1 shadow home secretary @entity2 said the @entity3 has details of suspects but lacks the resources to investigate them all the government ’s flagship anti-crime agency is failing to investigate up to 25,000 paedophiles suspected of downloading child pornography , @entity2 said today			1
the shadow home secretary said the @entity3 has details of the suspects but lacks the resources to investigate them all			1
she told @entity13 conference in @entity14 the lack of action could leave children at risk			1
she said : the @entity3 has the detail of over 25,000 people suspected of downloading vile abusive images of children online			1
’ ‘ but they have only investigated and arrested 660 suspects and they say the police do n’t have the capacity to investigate them all			1
‘ but the police arrest 230,000 people a year for theft			2
why do n’t they have the capacity to investigate 25,000 cases where children may be at risk ? ‘ the truth is this is not just about capacity it ’s about priority			1
‘ @entity37 says crime is falling and we do n’t need as many police			0
i say crime is changing and we need police and @entity45 action to keep our children safe			1
miss @entity2 also said @entity13 would take action to deport thousands more @entity48 foreign criminals including violent thugs – who are currently allowed to remain in the country			1
at the moment , she said their offences were not deemed serious enough to warrant being kicked out of the country			0
@entity13 would ditch the current requirement for criminals to have received a sentence of two years or more – or 12 months for sexual , violent or drugs crimes – before they can be deported			2
instead , she said , anyone who commits a crime like common assault – and who has lived in the @entity64 for as little as six months – should be considered for automatic removal			0
repeat offenders , such as prolific thieves , could also qualify for immediate removal under the new rules			0
it also emerged @entity13 is to hit thousands of pubs and clubs with a late night opening tax – in a blunt admission of the chaos caused by 24 - hour drinking laws			1
in 2003 @entity77 opened the door to round - the - clock drinking with the claim that it would lead to a @entity48 style café culture			2
instead , it unleashed a wave of booze - fuelled violence across the country , with police comparing towns and cities to the @entity89			0
miss @entity2 said drinking venues wanting to open beyond midnight will be forced to cough up thousands of pounds in the areas with the most alcohol licences			1
it will mean pubs , bars and clubs facing an additional charge of up to £ 4,400 a year if they want to stay open late			1
aides said extending the current @entity100 ’s @entity99 to 100 areas would raise £ 12million which would be handed to the police and local authorities to help pay for clean - up costs and put extra officers on the street			0
the policy was drawn up by @entity37 in an effort to control drinking excess – but it has been adopted by only a handful of councils			0
miss @entity2 's husband @entity113 ( centre ) watches her speech in the conference hall , as she said @entity13 would take action to deport thousands more @entity48 foreign criminals including violent thugs @entity13 officials said the levy had proved ‘ ineffective ’ and only raised ten per cent of the £ 17million ministers hoped for			1
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity37 talks a good game , but she is n't finding savings to help the police protect the frontline			0
we want to see proper enforcement of the @entity99 for the top 100 licensing authorities			0
’ however , the move will leave @entity13 open to the charge that it is trying to put the ‘ genie back in the bottle ’ from a problem it created			2
earlier this month , senior police officers made a desperate plea for moderation in drinking as they admitted defeat in tackling @entity64 ’s excessive boozing culture			0
the country ’s most senior officer responsible for alcohol - related crime called for an end to the attitude which tolerates out - of - control drunkenness as ‘ normal ’			0
chief constable @entity149 also admitted officers ’ efforts to combat booze fuelled yobbishness and violence had ‘ barely scratched the surface ’ of a problem that is ‘ blighting our communities ’			0
he also called for much tougher action against the alcohol industry , a clampdown on cheap booze and more action to combat criminals with alcohol problems			2
since 2007 , the number of town centres and neighbourhoods officially classed as being overrun by problem pubs and bars has rocketed by 150 per cent .			2
