@entity0 is ignoring the background noise about his future , such is the on - loan defender 's determination to complete @entity6 's ' special season ' by securing @entity8 qualification			1
eyebrows were raised last summer when the 26 - year - old moved to @entity11 's on a season - long loan , just months after playing for @entity13 in the @entity15 final			1
@entity0 's form on the south coast has attracted interest from the likes of @entity20 and @entity21 , but @entity23 's side have the option to make the deal permanent for just £ 6.8million			1
@entity0 has been in superb form this season at @entity6 since joining on loan from @entity13 the @entity29 international has expressed a desire to stay at @entity6 , but the waters are muddied by @entity13 's ability to nullify the buy - out clause by paying them £ 1.5million			1
@entity36 recently indicated the @entity38 club would invoke that clause , saying @entity41 's men were counting on him for next term , but @entity0 is unclear whether he will be at @entity11 's , the @entity43 or elsewhere			1
' i saw something in the @entity47 papers , ' said @entity0			1
' i do n't know , i did n't hear from them			2
' it is not ( frustrating ) because it does not matter what they say , what is in the papers			2
' i am just focused on @entity6 and we are playing for a @entity8 spot , so it is going to be a special season			1
' i am focused , i am happy here , so , yeah , no problem for me			2
' @entity0 has been one of @entity6 's best players in a remarkable season			1
many predicted a relegation battle for @entity23 's men , yet saturday 's 2 - 0 win against @entity67 saw them equal the record @entity68 points tally of 56 set last year			2
last season @entity0 was playing in the @entity15 final for his parent club , and he could return ' it is has been a very nice season , ' @entity0 said			1
' we like to play football , we have a good team and we have good results			2
' we are playing for the @entity8 spots so i am happy			2
' the win over @entity67 was unconvincing but gave @entity6 's faint top - four hopes a boost			1
bettering the fifth place of 1985 looks a big ask but not impossible after @entity87 's penalty and a late @entity89 strike			0
' we just have to look to ourselves and not to look to other teams , ' @entity0 said			2
' we know we have six games left , so it is going to be a hard sprint			0
' the games are all tough , like next week @entity95 away			0
it is a very difficult game , but we are going to try and win our games			0
the @entity99 defender tackles @entity100 , and says he is ignoring rumours about going back to @entity47 ' we know we have @entity21 at home so we can do good business , but first we have to go to @entity95 and that is going to be difficult			1
' the result leaves @entity67 further in the mire given they face an unenviable run of fixtures from now until the end of the season			0
city have a two - week break before their next match at @entity115 , where @entity116 knows they need to put saturday 's disappointment behind them			0
' it is a massive disappointment , ' the @entity67 skipper said			0
' the first half , i thought we got right at them and i think @entity126 ( goalkeeper @entity125 ) probably made one save			0
' we were hoping to do the same in the second , but goals change games , big decisions in games			0
@entity0 is focused on @entity8 qualification , and @entity6 took another step towards that goal against @entity67 ' the yellow card incident where @entity138 ( @entity137 ) is covered in claret , where ( @entity89 ) has caught him flush straight in the face , that for me is a red card , but obviously with the penalty the ref got that right			1
' there was a lot more chances created by us than them , but at the end of the day we go away with no points which is a massive disappointment for us			0
' the teams in and around us are winning , so it 's about ourselves			0
we need to starting picking up some points			0
' @entity67 captain @entity116 admitted that his team need to start picking up points if they are to survive			0

@entity0 is on loan at @entity6 from @entity13
@entity99 defender can join permanently in the summer for just £ 6.8million
but @entity13 may want to bring him back to the @entity43
@entity20 and @entity21 also interested in the defender
@entity0 focused on helping @entity6 qualify for @entity167
