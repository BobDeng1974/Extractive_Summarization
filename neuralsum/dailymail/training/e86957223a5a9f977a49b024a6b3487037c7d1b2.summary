by @entity1 reporter the death toll has risen to 22 in a killer heroin epidemic that has plagued the city of @entity5 , @entity6 , for the last nine days			1
numerous more victims of the super-powered heroin are flooding emergency rooms with non-fatal overdoses and even drug dealers are beginning to warn customers about the potency of the new strain			2
health officials believe the culprit is heroin laced with fentanyl , an opiate 100 time more powerful than morphine			1
the new hotshots are being sold on the street marketed as ' @entity22 , ' ' @entity23 ' and ' @entity24 , ' according to the @entity25			1
public health officials , along with federal , state and local police are rattling the bushes , rounding up addicts and dealers alike to determine the source of the deadly drugs			0
' you do n't know what 's in it			0
we know that the advice not to use heroin in the first place falls on deaf ears for people with addiction			2
' if you do n't heed that advice and you are going to use , i would recommend using significantly less because if you do n't , this could be the last time you shoot up			0
' three people were declared dead sunday morning alone after apparent heroin overdoses in @entity64 and officials warn the situation now looks startlingly like the crisis of 1988 when 18 @entity68 were killed by a powerful synthetic heroin called @entity70			1
' the fentanyl we 're seeing as a powder has to be made by somebody , ' @entity64 medical examiner dr. @entity71 told @entity76			0
' somebody is making this somewhere in a clandestine laboratory			0
' @entity80 is manufactured as a legal pain killer , but authorities suspect the fentanyl that laced the heroin was made in an illegal lab ' by some clever chemists			1
' @entity64 sees about one overdose case per day , @entity71 said			0
what 's happened in the past week is extremely out of the ordinary			0
' we usually deal with 250 drug overdoses a year so what ’s going on is really significant , ' he told the @entity25			0
@entity80 resembles heroin , though it is much more potent , and it has been blamed for dozens of deaths around the @entity96 been here before ? found in some of the @entity22 bags was the super-potent narcotic @entity22 , which officials like @entity64 medical examiner dr. @entity71 ( right ) says makes the recent rash of deaths eerily similar to the 1988 @entity70 epidemic @entity70 : in 1988 , 18 were killed in the @entity5 area by a drug called 3 - methylfentanyl , a sort of synthetic heroin with the street name @entity70 each of the people who died in the rash of overdoses has a known history of drug abuse , particularly heroin , @entity71 said			1
deaths also have been reported in @entity118 , @entity5 mayor @entity116 ’s office said			0
the area has seen periodic rises in the overdose rate , notably in 1988 when a potent chemical called 3 - methylfentanyl , @entity123 , was introduced to heroin users in the area , killing 18 of them			1
it remains to be seen if each of the recent victims died due to heroin laced with fentanyl			2

' we ’re obviously dealing with a major public health crisis , ' he said , something ' bringing to mind the very localized @entity70 epidemic we had in 1988			1

*investigators* have found many of the drug users possessed heroin bags labelled ' @entity22 , ' ' @entity23 ' and ' @entity24 '
tests *revealed* those bags were laced with the super powerful narcotic @entity80
*experts* have likened the rash of deaths to the 1988 synthetic heroin called ' @entity70 ' killed 18 in the city
