by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 9:14 pm on 21st october 2011 it is an argument that many would think is long forgotten now that the two countries have one of the strongest international alliances in the world			2
but that has not stopped a team of lawyers from the @entity10 challenging the @entity11 that released the @entity12 from their colonial masters			1
a debate took place this week in @entity16 - the city where discussions began in 1776 and concluded in the separation on july 4 - between the two countries testing the validity of the document			2
@entity24 ( left ) , former president of @entity22 , @entity23 , headed the @entity10 team while @entity26 , @entity27 of @entity28 , spoke for the @entity12 side treason ? the @entity10 team argued , during a tongue - in - cheek discussion , that the @entity11 was n't worth the paper on which it was written @entity24 , former president of @entity22 , @entity23 , headed the @entity10 team while @entity26 , @entity27 of @entity28 , spoke for the @entity12 side			1
they questioned various aspects of the declaration that founded @entity38 and led to the @entity39 that ended with the @entity40 in 1783			0
it was claimed by the @entity10 that the declaration signed seven years earlier was in fact illegal			1
the @entity10 half of the discussion , which took place in the @entity47 , said it was totally illegitimate and amounted to treason			1
during the tongue - in - cheek argument , one of the @entity10 team said : ' there really is no need for you @entity54 to keep picking at this ancient scab two centuries or so later			1
' they argued that just because you want to start a new law , it does n't mean you can just do such a thing			2
in their brief , they said : ' what if @entity66 decided today it wanted to secede from the @entity68 ? @entity71 made the case against secession and he was right ' , the @entity70 reports			0
making history : @entity75 on july 4 , 1776 in response , the @entity12 said : ' the @entity77 had used their own declaration of rights to depose @entity79 and these acts were deemed completely lawful and justified			1
' when it comes to taxing people without giving them representation , the @entity10 lawyers said that that was simply a wish of colonists			1
they argued that they should be grateful that @entity10 protected them at great expense from the @entity90 during a seven - year war			1
the @entity12 , however , said the @entity11 was formed through ' natural law ' , which the @entity10 said is an undefined concept			1
they also said that the document was legal because there had been other movements of independence across the world that had been recognised in the @entity100 charter			1
at the end , a vote was held and it was decided that the @entity12 would survive for another day and maintain its independence			1
the @entity104 , which helped establish the guiding principles of modern democracy , was written mainly by @entity12 founding father @entity107 and is described by historians as ' @entity38 's birth certificate '			1
it includes the then extraordinary assertion : ' we hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , ' which paved the way for the @entity116 13 years later			0
it was signed by 56 delegates from the 13 @entity12 colonies that were at war with @entity10			1
the 200 first copies were made by printer @entity122 that night and distributed throughout the colonies the following morning to be read aloud to the colonists and their militia			0
writing the @entity11 , 1776 : from left , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity107 the @entity12 revolution was the political upheaval during the latter half of the 18th century			2
thirteen colonies in @entity38 joined forces to break free from the @entity136 - giving rise to the @entity12			2
rejecting the authority of @entity10 's @entity139 to govern them from overseas , by 1774 , each colony had set up a provisional @entity141 ... january 10 , 1776 : @entity142 published a booklet entitled @entity144			2
it outlined his vision of a government in which the people , through their elected representatives , would have supreme power			0
@entity142 was the first to openly suggest independence from @entity10			1
@entity144 was read by many , including @entity152			0
the work was to have a massive influence on @entity107 in his writing of the @entity11			0
may : @entity141 , meeting in @entity16 , receives @entity157 's resolution urging the colonies to become free and independent states			0
june 11 : @entity107 , @entity129 , @entity128 , @entity160 , and @entity161 are appointed to a committee to draft a declaration of independence			0
june 12 - 27 : @entity107 is chosen to write the first draft , of which only a fragment exists			0
@entity107 's clean copy - the ' original rough draught ' - is reviewed by the committee			0
both documents are in the manuscript collections of the @entity171			0
july 1 - 4 : @entity141 debates and revises the declaration			0
july 2 : @entity141 declares independence			0
@entity174 , president of the @entity141 and @entity175 , the secretary , signed the document			0
