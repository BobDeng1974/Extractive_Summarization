@entity0 have ended speculation surrounding @entity3 's future - with their outgoing president confirming he will cut short the @entity6 's contract at the end of the season			1
@entity3 was widely rumoured to be leaving the team he has been part of since 2010 , but @entity11 finally provided confirmation that he would be heading for the exit on @entity15 television			2
' @entity3 is leaving for two reasons , ' @entity11 said			0
' one , he wants another environment			0
two , because he is an age when he can not wait to win again			0
' @entity0 's @entity3 ( right ) says it is ' unlikely ' that he will be driving for @entity21 next season @entity3 is said to have lost faith in @entity0 's ability to produce a winning car as he currently sits sixth in the drivers ' championship with three races remaining			1
' he was disappointed that he has not won over these last years and wanted new stimulus , ' @entity11 confirmed			0
@entity3 gave a hint about his @entity31 future at sunday 's @entity33 @entity32 by saying the decision would seem obvious once announced and he was unlikely to drive for a @entity21 - powered team			1
' i 'm not in a hurry ... i understand the curiosity , and i understand , for the fans , the news that can be around the future , ' the @entity6 told reporters			0
' but do not worry , do not worry			0
just relax , enjoy , and when it 's time to know it , you will know it			0
@entity3 has been at @entity0 since 2010 , but has never won a @entity47 with the @entity15 team ' my mind is set , for the last two or three months , and when you know you will understand that probably it was very obvious what i would do , ' added the double world champion			1
in a separate interview with @entity56 television , @entity3 said ' i do n't think so ' when asked if he would be driving for a team with @entity21 engines			1
that would appear to leave only a return to @entity61 , who are starting a new partnership with @entity64 , or staying at @entity0 as the 33 - year - old 's realistic options of a drive given that @entity69 - powered @entity68 have announced a 2015 line - up			1
although @entity3 has a contract at @entity0 until the end of 2016 , he is expected to leave at the end of the year to make way for four - times champion @entity75			1
@entity76 , @entity0 's 2007 champion , has a contract for 2015 but has been eclipsed by @entity3 this year			2
@entity78 driver @entity3 could yet remain with @entity0 , but only if @entity76 leaves the team @entity75 announced last week that he was leaving @entity68 at the end of the year , with his team 's principal @entity80 saying the driver was heading for @entity0			1
neither @entity0 nor the @entity83 have confirmed anything			0
maintaining the intrigue , @entity3 also said he wanted to do his best for the future of @entity0			2
' my decision ... was to help this fantastic team , and i 'm extremely happy with the things that will come , ' he said			0
@entity75 ( right ) is reported to be joining @entity0 , but it has n't yet been announced			2

@entity3 set to leave @entity0 after five seasons
@entity75 seems set to join @entity0 next season
@entity78 driver @entity3 has said it is unlikely he will drive for @entity21
@entity61 appear to be the *likeliest* option for @entity3
