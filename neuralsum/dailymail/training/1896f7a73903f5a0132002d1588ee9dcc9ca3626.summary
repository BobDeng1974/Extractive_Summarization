by @entity0 published : 15:00 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 16:23 est , 2 august 2013 a @entity2 newspaper editor has been fired after writing a headline critical of president @entity4			1
@entity6 's editorial , titled , ' take your jobs plan and shove it , mr. president : your policies have harmed @entity12 enough , ' was published in the @entity13 earlier this week when @entity4 visited the city			1
the timing of the column gave it a national audience it might not otherwise have had			0
as a result , it went viral online and @entity6 , the editor of the @entity13 editorial page , has since been let go			1
@entity6 says he was fired from his job as an editor for the @entity13 for writing an @entity25 headline on an editorial the newspaper said it fired @entity6 for violating a policy requiring that last - minute changes to headlines be approved by upper management			1
in a statement published to its website on friday , the paper stated : ' on monday night , @entity6 changed the approved headline on his tuesday editorial from , “ keep your jobs plan to yourself , mr. president : your policies have harmed @entity12 enough already ” to “ take your jobs plan and shove it , mr. president : your policies have harmed @entity12 enough			1
” ' however , he waited until his editor had left for the day before changing the headline , ' the statement continued			2
' that is a violation of our clear editing practice , and our trust			0
he admitted the following day that he failed to follow the standard set for him			0
' @entity6 claims that the editing policy was implemented after his piece was published earlier this week			1
he says the real reason he was fired was because of pressure on his bosses from @entity4 's supporters			2
' [ the editor ] said that she was disappointed in the headline , that she thought it was crass and she 'd gotten a lot of complaints by @entity4 supporters , ' he said in an interview with @entity62			1
' today i come into work and am told that i 'm fired for violating that policy that was n't put in place until the day after i wrote the piece			2
' the newspaper said it fired @entity6 for ' placing a headline on an editorial outside of normal editing procedures ' @entity6 said he feels ' confident ' that if the headline had referenced former president @entity73 rather than @entity4 , that he would still have a job			1
he also pointed out that his headline was not changed online for several hours after the editorial was published to the paper 's website			2
' i just became the first person in the history of newspapers to be fired for writing a paper 's most - read article , ' he tweeted			0
the paper pushed back against @entity6 's claims that his editors bowed to political pressure			1
' @entity6 ’s firing was not about yielding to political pressure , ' the paper said in its statement published online , which was not attributed to a specific person			1
' he was not fired for writing an editorial criticizing president @entity4			2
the body of the editorial was approved for publication ; only the headline was changed			2
' in a clear dig at @entity6 , the paper added : ' the only instance when the @entity13 ever denied @entity6 the freedom to present his views was last week when he referred to pornography as a “ miracle product ” and touted the benefits of pornography stating that if teenagers watched pornography it would result in lower rates of teenage pregnancy			1
' this statement was published to the @entity13 website on friday : contrary to statements made by former @entity13 editor @entity6 and national media reports , @entity6 was told on multiple prior occasions not to make material changes to editorials or headlines once they were approved by the editor responsible for the page			1
on monday night , @entity6 changed the approved headline on his tuesday editorial from , “ keep your jobs plan to yourself , mr. president : your policies have harmed @entity12 enough already ” to “ take your jobs plan and shove it , mr. president : your policies have harmed @entity12 enough			1
” however , he waited until his editor had left for the day before changing the headline			0
that is a violation of our clear editing practice , and our trust			0
he admitted the following day that he failed to follow the standard set for him			0
the language he chose was vulgar and not appropriate for this newspaper			0
even @entity6 himself admitted that the headline was “ harsh and perhaps crass to a fault ” in an editorial he wrote for this sunday , which will not run			1
@entity6 ’s firing was not about yielding to political pressure			1
he was not fired for writing an editorial criticizing president @entity4			0
the body of the editorial was approved for publication ; only the headline was changed			0
the newspaper has allowed @entity6 to write his opinions freely and without censorship during the time he worked here – even when he wrote about very controversial topics that many readers complained about			0
in the past year we have printed at least 46 editorials critical of @entity4 on the free press page			0
in fact the only instance when the @entity13 ever denied @entity6 the freedom to present his views was last week when he referred to pornography as a “ miracle product ” and touted the benefits of pornography stating that if teenagers watched pornography it would result in lower rates of teenage pregnancy			2
the @entity13 values having two editorial pages to express both conservative and liberal views			0
we encourage differing viewpoints and dissent , we believe having competing views makes community stronger			0
we expect those debates to be respectful			0
