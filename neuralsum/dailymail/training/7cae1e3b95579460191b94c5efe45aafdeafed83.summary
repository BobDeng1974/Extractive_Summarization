by @entity0 published : 13:45 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 13:56 est , 12 march 2013 they call him @entity3 , the @entity4 farmer who refused to leave his home town despite it being less than six miles away from the crippled @entity8 nuclear plant			1
defiant @entity9 , 53 , is the only remaining inhabitant of the town of @entity9 which was a thriving community of 16,000 people before the tsunami hit two years ago			1
the rice farmer disobeyed government orders to leave and has stayed on to feed the town 's animals including his own 50 cows and two ostriches			1
he put his health at further risk by eating food that had also been exposed to radiation , although he is now surviving on relief supplies delivered from outside and water that has been checked for radiation			1
when researchers at the @entity36 conducted tests , mr @entity27 was found to have the highest level of radiation in anyone they had tested			1
he told @entity42 : ' when i went down and let them look me over , they told me i was the " champion "			2
' but they also told me that i would n’t get sick for 30 or 40 years			2
i ’ll most likely be dead by then anyway , so i could n’t care less			2
' mr @entity27 is permanently exposed to up to 17 times the level of radiation that is considered safe mr @entity27 feeds a calf and pony at his farm in @entity9 , inside the nuclear exclusion zone surrounding the @entity8 nuclear plant a man apart : mr @entity27 at his home in the town of @entity9 a once - thriving community of 16,000 people @entity58 , who is a fifth generation rice - farmer , did leave the town for a short while to live with his parents in the south of the country , but after a few days he could not bear the thought of the animals left to fend for themselves so he returned			1
he added : ' i was scared at first because i knew the radiation had spread everywhere			1
' the next thought in my head was that if i stayed too long , i ’d end up with cancer or leukemia			2
but , the longer i was with the animals , the more i came to see that we were all still healthy and that we would be ok			2
' as well as the animals on his own farm mr @entity27 now cares for dozens of former pet dogs and cats left behind when the town was evacuated			1
he explained : ' our dogs did n’t get fed for the first few days			2
when i did eventually feed them , the neighbors ’ dogs started going crazy			0
' i went over to check on them and found that they were all still tied up			0
everyone in town left thinking they would be back home in a week or so , i guess			1
from then on , i fed all the cats and dogs every day			0
mr @entity27 is the only resident to have stayed on in @entity9 less than six miles from the @entity8 nuclear plant companions : mr @entity27 feeds his two ostriches			1
he went to live with his parents for a short time but returned because he could not bear the thought of the animals being left to fend for themselves ' they could n’t stand the wait , so they ’d all gather around barking up a storm as soon as they heard my truck			0
everywhere i went there was always barking			0
like , ‘ we ’re thirsty ’ or , ‘ we do n’t have any food			0
’ so i just kept making the rounds			0
' among the animals he rescued was a dog that had been trapped inside a cattle barn for a year and a half			0
it had only survived by eating the flesh of cattle that had starved to death			0
when mr @entity27 rescued it in the summer of 2012 most of its fur had fallen out			0
but thanks to mr @entity27 's loving care it has made a remarkable recovery and most of its fur has now grown back			0
mr @entity27 named him @entity130 , which means ' miracle ' in @entity133			0
without any humans about many of the town 's dogs and cats havegone feral and now live in the forest			1
sadly hundreds of head of cattle were left to starve to death inside a nearby barn and despite mr @entity27 's efforts many of the survivors are severely undernourished			0
nevertheless he has pledged to stay on as long and care for them for as long as he can			0
he said : ' i was born and raised in this town , ' he told us			1
' when i die , it ’s going to be in @entity9			1

@entity9 is the only remaining inhabitant of the town of @entity9
less than six miles from the crippled power *station* it was home to 16,000
defiant rice farmer is constantly exposed to dangerous levels of radiation
