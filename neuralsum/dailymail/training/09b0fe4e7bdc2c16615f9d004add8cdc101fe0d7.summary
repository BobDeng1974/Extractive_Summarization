by @entity0 the @entity1 could soon be transformed into a giant vacuum cleaner			0
@entity3 from the @entity4 has designed a structure that could be attached to the top of the tower in @entity8 and used to ' suck up ' the dust from air pollution			1
his synth [ e ] tech [ e ] cology design would then convert caught carbon dioxide into natural gas by using water and sunlight - producing around 100 metric tonnes of methanol a year			1
this artist 's impression shows what the carbon fibre and steel rigging design would look like			2
the project , called @entity11 [ e ] tech [ e ] cology , captures air pollution and converts it into fuel architect student @entity3 believes his synth [ e ] tech [ e ] cology project could also become a tourist attraction , as this artist 's impression demonstrates @entity11 [ e ] tech [ e ] cology design turns the carbon dioxide found in the air into natural gas , called methanol			1
the technology takes the carbon dioxide and mixes it in a water - filled chamber with an electrode and a catalyst			1
the reaction caused by mixing these chemicals converts @entity57 into a new molecule , methanol			2
methanol can be used as a fuel , an industrial solvent or a starting material for the manufacture of other chemicals			0
@entity3 chose the @entity1 because it is one of the city 's tallest buildings - at 581 feet			2
he also added that through pollution data mapping the area around @entity72 area - near where the tower is based - was found to be @entity75 's worst hotspot for air pollution due to heavy traffic			1
however , the architect believes the design could also be used on other tall buildings			0
the structure would be made from carbon fibre , filled with nanotubes and suction points to collect the carbon dioxide and pollution , and fitted to the tower using steel rigging			1
@entity3 claims that the structure could also be a good way of harvesting energy from abandoned structures and building around the city			1
in a video explaining his concept , @entity3 said : ' pollution could be another economy			2
' with recent technological advancements , pollutants could be positively employed as abundant , alternative , resources rather than simple negative filthy and sometimes fearsome matter			0
the synth [ e ] tech [ e ] cology structure is filled with nanotubes			0
these tubes are used to capture the carbon dioxide in the air , mix it with a catalyst , and convert it into natural gas , or methanol this images shows the inner workings of the @entity11 [ e ] tech [ e ] cology by architect student @entity3			1
the carbon dioxide and hydrogen is captured in the tubes and structures at the base of the unit			1
it is then mixed with a catalyst and water and releases methanol from the valves hanging from the design this artist 's impression shows how the structures design look like from the top of the @entity1			2
@entity3 believes the design could be used on other tall buildings ' the new parasitic infrastructure has aim to raise the most polluted level of air to above 60m with liquid asset production process , showing alternate ways for ' economic profit ' meaningfully engaged into pollution can be a provocative strategy for ' sustainable ecology			1
' he also described the technology as a giant ' vacuum cleaner ' - sucking dust particles and soot from the air			0
the project is described as a hybrid between ' a vertical oil field , which can directly provide recycled petrol generated from heavy traffic area , and laboratory for future resources scrubbed from atmosphere			0
' in the video @entity3 predicts that the @entity1 will eventually become redundant			2
he suggests turning it into an eco-skyscraper that would collect airborne soot and dirt particles , which would in turn to reduce respiratory illnesses across the capital			0
his project plans to use some of the recent advancements in particle - capturing technologies developed by teams such as @entity165			0
the team was one of the first to successfully convert carbon dioxide to methanol using the catalyst method			1
it aims to ' show how hybrisided new infrastructure can gather pollutants , store , digest , and harvest them to dilute minerals and biofules , celebrating clean air process on the ground level			0
' the architecture student created the concept as his diploma project			0
he was named one of two winners of the @entity186 in late june .			0

@entity3 from the @entity4 has designed a structure that could be attached to the top of the tower in @entity8
the carbon and steel structure on the tower would ' suck up ' air pollution
captured carbon dioxide would then be converted into natural gas
designer claims it could produce 100 metric tonnes of methanol a year
