it was perhaps meant to be that @entity2 's first goal in his second spell at @entity4 came from the penalty spot in the @entity6 - just as his first period at the club ended			1
and the @entity4 legend went for the same corner of the net as his winning spot kick in @entity13 just over two years ago , this time marking the 12th consecutive season in which he has scored in the @entity6			1
only @entity15 and @entity17 's @entity16 has a better record , notching in 14 campaigns back - to - back , while @entity20 managed 11			1
@entity2 celebrates the penalty marking his 12th consecutive year of scoring in the @entity6 @entity2 's penalty against @entity23 ( right ) was very similar to his strike that won @entity4 the @entity6 the @entity26 powerhouse raises his hands to thank the @entity4 supporters after scoring against @entity23 @entity2 holds the @entity6 trophy aloft after scoring the winning penalty against @entity31 @entity2 started his run in the 2003/04 season with @entity34 before scoring in all eight of his previous seasons in the competition with @entity4			2
he then grabbed goals in the past two seasons for @entity40 club @entity39 during his time there			0
and his 23rd minute penalty made it 12 - in - a - row as well as giving @entity4 a 2 - 0 lead that @entity23 never looked likely to overhaul			2
it was his seventh appearance of the season in a bit - part role in @entity49 's squad , but the @entity26 could end up starting at @entity50 against @entity51 on sunday with @entity52 and @entity53 both nursing injuries			0
@entity2 points to the sky after doubling @entity4 's lead over @entity23 to put them in a comfortable position @entity2 chases down a @entity6 ball for @entity34 and celebrates scoring in his first @entity4 year @entity2 celebrates after scoring against @entity59 in year two at @entity4 and against @entity60 in year three @entity2 was a nightmare for @entity62 in his fourth and fifth years at @entity4 in the @entity6 ... a goal at @entity64 sees @entity2 stick his tongue out , before he converts a penalty in the 2010/11 season @entity2 finally won the big - eared trophy in 2011/12 before moving , and scoring , with @entity39 in 2012/13 more goals in @entity70 followed before he returned to @entity71 to score against @entity23 @entity53 came off for @entity2 against @entity23 with a suspected groin problem , while top scorer @entity52 is still wrestling with a hamstring injury suffered on international			1

@entity4 went on to win the competition that year			0
what chances of @entity77 and @entity2 replicating the feat again this season ? @entity53 limped off to be replaced by @entity2 against @entity23 and it is feared he could miss the next game @entity52 's fitness is also up in the air ahead of @entity4 's visit to @entity50 to face @entity51			0
