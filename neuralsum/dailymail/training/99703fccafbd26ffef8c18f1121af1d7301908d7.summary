by @entity0 published : 10:19 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 11:35 est , 26 november 2013 women have been paying the price of wearing high heels for years suffering from sore feet , aching legs and a bad back for a height and style boost			0
but now a brand say they can offer a three - and - a - half - inch shoe that is both comfortable and stylish			1
@entity10 brand hotter have created the boutique by @entity13 collection which they describe as fashionable and elegant - but best of all comfy			1
impressed : podiatrist @entity14 put different styles of @entity13 's ' most comfortable shoes you 'll ever wear ' to the test founder of the @entity21 - based company , @entity22 , said he 's always strived to ' create and design shoes as comfortable as slippers '			1
doing this when it comes to heels is no mean feat but they say they have achieved it thanks to using a stable block heel , flexible sole , soft leather linings and cushioning at ball and heel of the foot			1
but this is no ordinary cushioning - it 's @entity42 - inspired cushioning made with a ' pyramid construction '			1
a spokesman for the brand explains : ' pyramid technology puts science into comfort			2
hidden deep inside the shoe sole is a pyramid - shaped foam pad which contracts and traps air as you walk , acting as a cushion to the balls of your feet where pressure can be constant			1
' placed directly above the flexi grooves of the shoes ' sole , the special pads enhance flexibility and soften this part of the insole			0
' in boutique by @entity13 , styles are enhanced with an added layer of foam at the heel to making them the most comfortable fashion styles you 'll ever wear			2
' the claims will be welcome news to the thousands of women who suffer from foot , leg and back pain thanks to their love of high heels			0
happy feet : @entity13 's @entity66 collection comes in styles for work and play and use pyramid cushioning for a comfortable fit			1
the buckle style called ' glamour ' , far left , is £ 95 , while the red and silver glitter ' admire ' shoes are £ 85 each the dangers of high heels include compression of the spine , damage to the joints and developing bunions and blisters from the way the toes are pushed forward into the end of the shoe			0
but are @entity13 's claims that they 've designed comfortable heels too good to be true ? @entity107 asked podiatrist @entity14 to put them to the test			1
she said : when i wore them i immediately felt the comfort of the cushioning			0
the stacked , blocked - yet elegant - heel was noticeably effective			2
no rubbing , full cushioning and easy to walk on			0
' the foot expert said she was ' very impressed ' with the fit and feel of the shoe - and was especially pleased they they are available in half sizes			2
beauty is pain : many women feel the pinch from wearing high heels , they can also cause damage to joints she said : ' they fit really well with that all important half size			0
it will be a pleasure to add @entity13 shoes to the list of where to get shoes that really fit to those of us with half sizes			0
@entity142 and some specialist areas seemed to be the last to maintain this @entity10 sizing			0
' @entity14 wore the shoes to a recent world conference in podiatry in @entity148 where she said had the opportunity to test the comfort of the shoes and see what her podiatrist peers thought of them			1
after putting them to the test , she concluded : ' this is a well made , accessible , flexible high heel shoe			1
' the attention to detail in the placement of the heel , flexibility at the forefoot and additional forefoot padding make for a comfortable , elegant and wearable high heel shoe			2
' the @entity66 collection is available at @entity167 , 50 hotter stores nationwide or via their mail order catalogue .			0
