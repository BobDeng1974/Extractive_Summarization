aid : the @entity5 approved the $ 50.5 billion disaster relief package for those devastated by the storm in a 241 - 180 vote recovery : the @entity10 is expected to accept the measure but there have been concerns that the package does not do enough @entity14 senator @entity26 said : ' while the @entity5 bill is not quite as good as the @entity10 bill , it is certainly close enough			1
' the aid package was supported by @entity5 democrats in large numbers in the vote , but substantial @entity35 backing was needed before its passage in the @entity35 - controlled @entity5			1
the victory has been tarnished by some who have complained that @entity39 approved tens of billions of dollars in aid within days of @entity41 but stalled for more than two months on @entity2			1
@entity2 pounded several states in late october and has been blamed for 140 deaths and billions of dollars in residential and business property damage			1
@entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 were hardest hit , with power outages and interruptions to public transportation causing the clamor for federal relief to begin almost immediately			2
@entity53 rep. @entity53 called the package an ' outstanding victory for the people of @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity57 '			2
immediate : @entity12 previously called for @entity58 to vote on the @entity2 aid ' without delay for our fellow @entity61 ' but he added that ' it is unfortunate that we had to fight so hard to be treated the same as every other state has been treated '			0

the @entity10 approved a $ 60.4 billion measure in the final days of the @entity39 that expired on january 3 and a @entity5 vote had been expected quickly			2
but @entity5 speaker @entity107 unexpectedly postponed the vote in the final hours of the expiring @entity39 as he struggled to calm politicians unhappy that the @entity5 had just approved a separate measure raising tax rates on the wealthy			0
@entity107 's delay sparked a public uproar , much of it from other @entity35 like @entity46 governor @entity114 who has lobbied @entity39 for aid			0
delay : @entity5 speaker @entity107 unexpectedly postponed the vote ' there 's only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims , the @entity5 majority and their speaker , @entity107 , ' mr @entity114 said on the day after the delay was announced			0

@entity39 has already approved a $ 9.7 billion increase in a fund to pay federal flood insurance claims , much of it expected to benefit victims of @entity2			2
firsthand : gov. @entity114 comforting a woman whose home was damaged by @entity2 the @entity5 - passed @entity2 aid package does not include some projects that were in the @entity10 version and drew sharp fire from conservatives as unrelated to the storm			1
