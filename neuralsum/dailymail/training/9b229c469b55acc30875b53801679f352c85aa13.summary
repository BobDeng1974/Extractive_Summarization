revealed : @entity0 , pictured today , has spoken about how a hoax caller was put through to his mobile just by claiming he was the director of @entity3 @entity0 has today revealed the moment a drunk hoax caller high on cocaine and cannabis was put through to his mobile as he carried his daughter on a family walk as part of his new pre-election fitness regime			1
the caller , who bragged later : ' i was off my face ' , said he was the head of spy agency @entity3 @entity16 and was put through to the prime minister by the @entity19 switchboard			1
mr @entity0 asked him : ' who is this ? '' and quickly ended the call when the prankster could only say : ' it is a hoax call '			1
@entity19 and the security services have now launched a major review of procedures following the breach , although mr @entity0 has said nobody would be sacked and no crime was committed			1
the prime minister has revealed the call came after he returned from @entity32 to pay his respects after the death of @entity35 and he was enjoying a ' very nice walk ' with his family when his mobile rang			1
he said : ' i had @entity38 on my back to add to the exercise regime that i 'm undertaking			2
my @entity41 went in my pocket , i answered it and it claimed to be a conference call established – which i do obviously very frequently – between the head of @entity3 and some of the staff in my office			2
' a voice came through , a voice i did n't recognise			0
the voice said he said he was sorry to wake me up , which i thought was strange as it was eleven o'clock in the morning , and so i quite rapidly asked ' who is this ? ' , to which the answer came ' it is a hoax call ' , and so i pushed the red button on the @entity41 which ended the call			1
' that is what happened so no harm was done , no national security was breached , but it is important when these things happen to make sure we do everything we can to put in place systems to we weed out hoax calls , but every now and again , i suspect these things will happen '			2
the call followed a separate astonishing security lapse earlier in the day when a caller , believed to be the same man , was given a mobile number for @entity3 director mr @entity16 after he rang the organisation			1
the unnamed man , described as well - educated and in his twenties , told a newspaper : ' i 've just made complete monkeys out of @entity3			2
i got the mobile number of a director			2
what 's more , i 'm off my face on booze and cocaine			2
i had some spliff too			0
i 've been up all night , i 'm utterly wasted – hilarious			0
' he had started making the calls in the early hours of sunday morning			0
first he called the @entity3 switchboard and said that he was an aide to the prime minister from @entity19			1
breach : a caller was given a mobile number for @entity3 director mr @entity16 after he rang the organisation , who gave him the director 's private mobile number he had told the operator that @entity16 was not answering his ' usual number ' so the @entity3 employee gave him the director 's personal blackberry			1
mr @entity16 is then said to have received a call from a man claiming to be a journalist from @entity117 - and then ended the call			2
security officials have insisted that it was not the line used by the @entity3 chief for ' secure ' top secret calls on matters of national security			2
on sunday morning the same caller is said to have impersonated mr @entity16 after calling the @entity19 switchboard - who put him through to the prime minister			1
all this was done by a man who ' could n't string a sentence together ' , he said			0
treasury minister @entity133 insisted @entity19 takes security ' very , very seriously '			1
she told @entity135 : ' there will now be a security review in light of what has happened			0
we 've had an issue here , it 's quite right and proper that @entity3 and @entity19 … look at the details of this … and they will have a thorough investigation			1
that is the right approach			0
' @entity19 last night insisted no confidential information had been disclosed by the prime minister			1
but both @entity149 and @entity3 , which eavesdrops on the phone calls of terror suspects and criminals , launched immediate inquiries into the security breach			2
last night no one had claimed responsibility for either of the calls			0
it was unclear if they were by the same person			0
attention is likely to focus on computer hackers or self - styled internet privacy campaigners unhappy with the prime minister 's stance on state surveillance			1
@entity19 said no sensitive information was disclosed during the ' quite brief ' conversation and said mr @entity0 ended the call upon realising it was a hoax			1
security procedures at @entity149 are now under review blunder : an operator at @entity3 in @entity175 appears to have handed over the number in the wake of the @entity180 attacks , he has called for greater powers to allow @entity3 to monitor the content of calls , emails and social media			1
early hours of sunday morning : hoaxer calls @entity3 switchboard and says that he is an aide from @entity19			1
tells operator that director @entity16 was not answering his ' usual number ' so the @entity3 employee promptly gave him the director 's personal blackberry			1
then calls mr @entity16 claiming to be a journalist - and the spy chief hangs up			0
11am sunday : same caller telephones the @entity19 switchboard pretending to be @entity16			1
he is then put through to the prime minister and has a ' brief ' conversation before @entity0 ends the call			1
it ’s not clear whether the man was put straight through by the switchboard or after being transferred to someone else			2
he provoked alarm among some privacy campaigners by suggesting services such as @entity208 should not be able to encrypt messages in a way they can not be read by spies			0
a government spokesman said : ' following two hoax calls to @entity214 departments today , a notice has gone out to all departments to be on the alert for such calls			0
' in the first instance , a call was made to @entity3 which resulted in the disclosure of a mobile phone number for the director			1
' the mobile number provided is never used for calls involving classified information			0
in the second instance , a hoax caller claiming to be the @entity3 director was connected to the prime minister			1
' the prime minister ended the call when it became clear it was a hoax			1
' mr @entity0 is not the first high profile victim of a prank call			2
a hoaxer in december 2012 sparked tragedy when an @entity242 radio station succeeded in getting through to a hospital where the @entity244 was being treated for morning sickness			0
the prank led to the death of nurse @entity248 , who took her own life after transferring the call			0
in 1995 , the @entity253 spoke to a prank caller for 17 minutes – believing the person was the @entity256 prime minister			1
in 1995 , the @entity253 spoke to a prank caller for 17 minutes , believing the person at the end of the line to be the @entity256 prime minister and in 1998 , @entity257 ( right ) took a call which he believed to be from @entity262 during the call , taken at @entity264 , she promised the man , who claimed to be @entity266 , that she would try to influence a referendum being held in @entity256			1
in fact , the caller was a @entity256 impressionist @entity268 calling on behalf of radio station @entity270 in @entity271			0
former prime minister @entity257 also fell for a prank call from a radio station			1
in 1998 , he took a call which he believed to be from then @entity275 leader @entity262			0
the caller was in fact @entity278 – a dj from @entity280			0
within moments , mr @entity257 realised that the call was a fake but played along with the joke			0
@entity0 is not the first prime minister to have a phone hoaxer put through to him			1
radio host @entity278 played the trick on @entity257 as he left his morning briefing in 1998 , right at the time , with the help of impressionist @entity289			0
@entity289 put on the voice of then - leader of the opposition @entity262 , and a @entity19 operator put him through			2
the impressionist told mr @entity257 he was ringing to see how he was and the prime minister laughed along and said : ' that 's quite a good imitation			2
' mr @entity257 knew it was not his @entity275 rival because @entity289 called him ' @entity298 ' , whereas mr @entity262 would always have used ' prime minister '			2
one of the most famous hoax calls ever staged came some three years earlier when the @entity253 chatted on air to a @entity256 dj pretending to be @entity256 prime minister @entity266			1
@entity268 got through to @entity264 , spoke to the monarch on - air for 15 minutes and elicited a promise for her to influence @entity306 's referendum on proposals to break away from @entity256			0
the @entity253 did not know it was a hoax with the @entity264 later describing the incident as ' irritating and regrettable '			0
on another occasion , @entity268 spoke to pope @entity311 , asking the pontiff if he had ever thought of fixing a toy propeller to his cap			0
in 2003 , @entity317 radio station @entity315 spoke to late @entity319 president @entity318 pretending to be @entity321 president @entity320 before reversing the prank by calling @entity320 posing as @entity318			0
@entity320 famously lost his temper and swore at the djs live on air after they revealed that ' the whole of @entity317 ' had been listening in on the joke			0
one of the most recent notorious pranks led to the death of a nurse at a hospital where the @entity244 was being treated for morning sickness			0
@entity242 djs @entity333 and @entity334 called king edward vii hospital impersonated the @entity253 and prince @entity336 to ask staff questions about the @entity244 's health			0
