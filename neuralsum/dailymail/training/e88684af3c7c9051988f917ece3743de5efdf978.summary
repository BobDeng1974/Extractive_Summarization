@entity2 , who has worked closely with @entity12 and has a long - standing relationship with @entity4 captain @entity14 , will be involved with @entity3 's squad and the manager is pleased to have him on board			1
' it is not just any psychiatrist , ' he said			1
' it is dr @entity2 , who is a very famous man in that area			1
' he has a great cv of working in different sports and has been doing some work with @entity12 and @entity25 so @entity2 knows him well			1
' it is something we have spoken about for some time but we wanted to get the right man - luckily @entity25 let me talk to @entity2 and he has accepted our invitations so we are happy with that			2
' @entity2 has also worked successfully with the @entity36 cycling team and five - time world snooker champion @entity37			2
endorsement : @entity14 had one - on - one meetings with @entity2 when going through a groin injury desperate : @entity41 is keen to make an impression on @entity3 neat touch : @entity44 juggles the ball during the training session at @entity47 on monday best of enemies : @entity49 and @entity50 ( right ) are battling for @entity4 's left back place @entity14 gave his ringing endorsement for @entity2 , and revealed he first met him three years ago			1
' i 've been seeing him for three years now , ' said @entity14			2
' first , when i had a groin problem and feared for my career in 2010			2
i saw him in a one - on - one situation and liked the work he did			2
i continued to see him and i 've seen more of him since he 's been connected with @entity12			1
' he ca n’t help you do a @entity59 turn better but he can help you to learn what goes on in your head and help with preparation			2
' i did n’t know what was going on in my head before i worked with him			2
he ’s helped me with mental prep before games			2
i feel i ’ve found my most consistent form since i ’ve been seeing @entity69 i ’m delighted the manager ’s got him on board			1
' heads up : @entity72 keeps his eye on the ball and will hope to get some game time against @entity76 something old , something new : it 's routine for @entity44 but @entity41 is preparing for his @entity4 debut @entity12 's @entity81 praised dr @entity2 in an interview last october as he hit top form for his club			1
' @entity2 had helped a lot in terms of mindset , ' he told the @entity89			2
' he 's all about self - belief : do n't go out there with the mentality of trying to do something , just let it happen			1
' @entity2 made @entity81 give himself a mark out of 10 for his @entity12 performances so far			2
the striker said : ' @entity2 told me to say high but i 've never been one to be comfortable			0
i 'm uncomfortable getting comfortable			0
' i think , for my capacity as a footballer , i 'd sat a seven out of 10			0
probably even six - i 'm being kind to myself saying a seven			0
i can do a lot better than i 'm doing now			0
' @entity3 also reacted to @entity103 's withdrawal from wednesday 's friendly at home to @entity76 and confirmed @entity104 is now set to earn his 50th cap			1
' it is unfortunate of course , ' @entity3 said of @entity103 's hip injury			1
' he has n't played for the last two or three games and we were hoping he would recover but he needs at least another week before he will be fit to play			0
' he was with us last night , we had a ' @entity11 ' meeting to put our plans forward			0
' there are n't that many defenders so there is a good chance , if you insist i tell you @entity104 will get his 50th cap at right - back then i can say yes			0
' @entity14 is joined in the @entity4 squad by @entity12 team - mates @entity104 , @entity124 , @entity81 and @entity125 and the skipper wants to see their club form relate into a good international showing if they are selected			1
still got it : @entity3 gets involved while on the pitch in @entity47 ' i think we have got five in the squad and everyone is in good form and feeling confident , ' he said			1
' if everyone is selected hopefully they can bring their performances tomorrow night			0
we are happy with where we are in the table			0
' you have got to give credit to @entity25 - if you are good enough he plays you			0
he is not scared and he has been paid back by them with top - class performances			0
' @entity41 , meanwhile , knows he needs to make the most of his first @entity4 appearance to make the plane to @entity11			1
@entity41 only made his league debut last year for @entity151 , but he looks set to earn his first @entity4 cap on wednesday night against @entity76			1
' if you get a chance you have to give everything and try and impress the manager , ' @entity41 told the @entity158 's website			1
' hopefully i can do it this week			0
' who is @entity2 ? a consultant psychiatrist and university lecturer who works with elite sports teams and senior management for corporate @entity166 has he helped ? @entity2 's clients include @entity169 cyclists such as sir @entity170 and sir @entity171 , @entity37 , @entity12 and @entity4 ’s @entity173 @entity172 ? @entity2 works to a principle called ‘ @entity175 ’ , which says the brain is split into three parts : the rational ‘ human ’ section , the illogical ‘ chimp ’ section and a computer for storing information			1
the way athletes control their ‘ chimp ’ dictates how well they perform			0
put simply , athletes need to control their surges of emotion			0
@entity188 does it work in practice ? @entity2 gets athletes to write down all the problems in their lives leading up to a big competition			0
for each problem they then have to provide a logical solution to help them deal with it			0
@entity2 also warns athletes against setting goals that are beyond their control			0
for example , footballers should not set a goal of becoming the best footballer in the world because they have no control over what other players will achieve			0
however , he will tell them to try and be the best they can possibly be and then devise a plan from there			0
