the @entity9 teenager , who won a gold medal in the @entity11 last year , was already in @entity12 with @entity13 when the @entity14 made its ruling			1
the @entity14 decided that 18 - year - old @entity1 , who was paralyzed by a rare neurological disorder seven years ago , was not suffering from a permanent disability and so was not eligible to be a paralympian			1
in a @entity24 post the swimmer , who broke world records for the 100m and 400m freestyle , said : ' to have trained so hard this past year and come so far only to be humiliated and targeted by the @entity14 for reasons unknown baffles me			1
' a statement released by the @entity14 , on the opening day of the world championships on sunday , said : ' @entity14 can confirm that @entity1 of the @entity13 will not participate at the @entity33 and future @entity14 competitions having failed to provide conclusive evidence of a permanent eligible impairment			1
' when @entity1 competed as part of @entity13 at the @entity38 last year she was classified as between being a 5 and 6 in a system where 15 is nearly able - bodied , according to @entity40			1
because of her paralysis she swims with only her arms			0
@entity1 , who was a runner up for @entity45 's @entity44 with a disability award this year , developed a rare neurological condition that paralyzed her and left her in a coma for three years			1
the condition , transverse myelitis in association with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or @entity54 , damages nerve cell fibers in the body			0
paralyzed : the teenager , who holds two world records , lost the use of her lower body through a rare neurological disease penalized : @entity1 , a runner up at the @entity45 awards this year , was banned because of the possibility that she may one day regain the use of her legs ' it started off with flu - like symptoms and pain , then i started feeling really funny , ' she said			1
' in two weeks i was paralyzed from the waist down ... every ability i had was slowly slipping away			0
' the @entity14 had requested more analysis into her condition after the @entity11 last year			2
a report was provided by @entity77 in july and , after references to the swimmer 's name was removed , it was sent to five independent medical experts for their opinion , @entity14 spokesman @entity75 wrote to @entity40			2
' all were in agreement that the report , its assessment and its diagnosis fail to provide sufficient evidence of an eligible impairment leading to permanent or verifiable activity limitation - which is required under the @entity90 , ' she said			0
@entity1 's father was disgusted by the ruling , saying : ' this kid has trained seven days a week for years and now she is being railroaded out			2
' he added : ' what kills me is their people have no experience with my daughter 's disease and have given an opinion			0
they 've got every disability in this organization , but this is discrimination			0
' @entity9 governor @entity107 has also rallied on the teenager 's behalf			0
shock : swim champion @entity1 was already in @entity12 when she was told she can not compete in a letter to the @entity14 she wrote : ' the basis for ruling @entity114 ineligible - the possibility that she might one day be able to resume use of her legs - is nothing short of disgraceful , undermining the very values of courage , inspiration , determination and equality that the @entity14 aims to promote			1
' a doctor contacted by the family to ensure @entity114 would not become further paralyzed through her condition , had suggested that the teenager could one day be able to walk again if she had years of physical therapy			0
dr @entity129 , of @entity130 in @entity131 , added however : ' it will take many months to years to get ms @entity1 back on her feet			2
i did not mean to imply that ms @entity1 would be able to walk quickly			2
' ' please do not misconstrue my plan as a statement of permanence of her disability , ' he said , according to @entity40			0
@entity1 said : ' i am not walking now and i wo n’t be in the near future , that ’s for sure			2
' heartbroken : @entity1 , pictured her receiving a silver medal at the @entity11 , was turned away from the championships ' i want to remain hopeful and i am being penalized for being hopeful , ' she added , according to @entity144			0
after being turned away from the @entity12 championships , @entity1 went to @entity146 with her mother and boyfriend			1
the triplet , who has three brothers , said : ' i am keeping my head held high and i am not bitter , discouraged or angry against them			0
