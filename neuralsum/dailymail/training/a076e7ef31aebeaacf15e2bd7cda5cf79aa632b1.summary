by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 05:16 est , 15 june 2013 on the face of it , chairman @entity1 , @entity2 and the @entity3 might seem like they have nothing in common			2
but despite that they have all used propaganda to bury themselves in people 's minds			1
whether used as a force for good or bad , propaganda is everywhere and a striking exhibition seeks to highlight just how prevalent it can be			1
the cult of personality : chairman @entity1 and @entity2 used striking portraits of themselves to impress the idea upon a nation that they were the undisputed leaders icons : this painting on the left presented @entity26 , who was himself from @entity27 , exactly as he wanted to be seen : as a cultured , learned scholar			1
the fictional character @entity29 ( right ) who was used to encourage enlistment in @entity31 , is now a cultural icon , instantaneously recognisable this collection of posters , scarfs , playing cards and even fans curated by the @entity39 highlight just how insidious , creative and humorous campaigns can be when trying to impress an idea on to its audience			1
the library 's exhibition propaganda : @entity47 and @entity48 , in @entity46 , explores how cultures across the world slipped their message into people 's minds - whether it be sneakily subtle or unapologetically obvious			1
it is the first exhibit to bring @entity57 dictator @entity1 's little red book and the terrifying drink - driving adverts together in one exhibition , which will prompt the audience to question just how much they are influenced by propaganda			1
curators have explored the myriad ways different states have used propaganda to influence the thoughts and feelings of a nation , whether the message it carries creates an enemy , generates feelings of national pride or promotes a healthy lifestyle			1
this slogan on the left has been used in @entity79 since @entity80 @entity81 had a mission to improve health through the prevention of disease and campaigns focused on personal responsibility			1
those who failed to heed good advice were characterised as a public menace			2
the medical officer journal used striking images ( right ) to promote better public health			2
flies were held responsible for contaminating food and spreading diseases and anti-fly campaigns were held across @entity79 and the @entity99 how to win the war : war bond stamps could be mass produced and circulated widely			1
@entity103 provided a symbol that would be understood anywhere in the @entity99 ( left )			2
the theme of ' freedom imperilled ' deflected from discussion of the rationale for joining the war			2
in @entity112 , the @entity111 set about using raising funds from the @entity79 public			0
this poster encourages donations by using a simple design to show a direct link between savings and military success ( right ) one of the exhibits shows a scarf handed out by the @entity79 government during @entity80 to boost weary citizens ' morale after the country was heavily bombarded by aerial attacks			0
the scarf , made in 1942 , showed a map demonstrating @entity46 ’s endurance in the face of @entity133 bombing			0
@entity134 's rousing ' we shall fight them on the @entity138 ' quote and @entity99 broadcaster , @entity141 ’s , famous exultation ' @entity46 can take it ! ' , run alongside a map of bomb sites			0
messages that stressed the resilience of @entity79 and of @entity79 character were used to rally and sustain support for the devastating war			0
an unusual method of propaganda was used by @entity151 in the 18th century			1
after another bout of sickness , @entity151 sought to re-establish his authority with a commemorative fan in 1789			0
changing people 's minds : the ' violated ' @entity158 often featured in @entity79 wartime propaganda with great emphasis placed on the plight of women , children and the elderly			1
this helped sustain @entity79 moral condemnation of @entity133 throughout the @entity80 , and was used to imply that a similar threat could face @entity79 families			0
in the @entity172 poster ( right ) , @entity170 's @entity169 is parodied as a look - out tower for @entity99 police to observe its people , mocking the idea that it is a symbol of freedom one way of getting your message across : this unusual commemorative fan ( left ) links the well - being of the nation with the health of the @entity151 using the phrase ' @entity186 is restored to one and happiness to millions '			1
the cards handed out to @entity99 troops in the @entity191 war ( right ) served a practical purpose - soldiers could identify @entity191 leaders - but also sent a message about the extent and quality of the @entity198 ’s intelligence , and its willingness to seek out the enemy the @entity201 featured in comics , television advertising and public information films as part of a co-ordinated road safety campaign it linked the well - being of the nation with the health of the @entity151 by declaring the phrase ' @entity186 is restored to one and happiness to millions			1
' while the power of persuasion can generate the idea of a common enemy for a nation , it can also be used to impress upon citizens the idea of an all - powerful leader			1
propaganda has been used by leaders across the nations to stamp their authority - convincing even the most cynical of their power and plans			1
chairman @entity1 's image was used in a variety of ways - from badges , to books , to posters - so that every citizen in the huge sub-continent country would be in no doubt that he was their unchallenged leader			1
it can be argued that without this wealth of ways that was used to spread the message of his personality , it would have been very difficult to bring the population under his control			2
more than two billion @entity1 badges , were produced during the @entity246 , ensuring that @entity1 was seen as the undisputed ruler across @entity57			0
the badges became essential for demonstrating revolutionary zeal , allowing wearers to both avoid denunciation and elevate themselves above their peers			0
the badges even became an alternative currency used to barter for goods and services			0
@entity2 also used propaganda to announce his rule - portraits were painted to inspire loyalty and intimidate critics at a time when the @entity263 's power was declining and @entity264 was besieged on all sides			2
while many would argue propaganda plays an important part in winning wars - from boosting morale to encouraging soldiers to enlist - it was used in a completely different way int the @entity273			2
coalition commanders circulated packs of playing cards to the @entity99 - led forces invading @entity191 in 2003 to enable troops to identify and capture prominent members of @entity281 's regime			0
the cards served a practical purpose but also sent a message about the extent and quality of the @entity198 ’s intelligence , and its willingness to seek out @entity191 leaders			0
the tactic was first used during the @entity290 ( 1861 – 65 )			0
propaganda could also be used to dismiss ideals embedded in other cultures - imperative if a nation wanted to indoctrinate its citizens into conforming to the government 's plans			1
in a @entity172 poster , @entity170 ’s famous @entity169 is parodied as a look - out tower for the @entity99 police to observe its people , mocking the idea that it is a symbol of freedom			0
the @entity304 was set up in 1961 by the @entity305 to encourage better road safety amongst children			0
cards and other material helped spread the message as @entity311 and his friends learned from @entity313 how to cross the road safely the ' @entity316 ' campaign aimed to discourage people from idly discussing war work and accidentally passing on secrets to enemy agents			0
more personal and mobile than a poster , the handkerchief and the humorous cartoons on it would have been a talking point in homes and workplaces			0
the government feared that continued aerial bombardment could lead to a collapse in the morale of @entity79 citizens			0
messages that stressed the resilience of @entity79 were used to sustain support for the war chairman @entity1 badges became a symbol used to support the cult of @entity1 's personality the poster attacks and subverts @entity99 propaganda that promoted the idea of the democratic freedom of the @entity346			2
but the art of persuasion is n't just used to convince people of government ideals , or the importance of war - it has been used for far less dramatic purposes			0
the @entity3 updated previous crossing drills as traffic became heavier and road layouts more complex - but it was with the help of a hero clad in green that the importance of road safety was impressed on people 's minds			0
the @entity201 featured in comics , television advertising and public information films as part of a co-ordinated road safety campaign			0
the 1976 media plan shows how various audiences were targeted by different media in order to maximise impact			0
following the 1967 @entity374 , national campaigns increasingly appeared in @entity374 as well as @entity376			2
curated by @entity378 and @entity379 , curators of @entity381 at the @entity39 , the exhibition explores the different ways in which the state has used propaganda to influence the thoughts and feelings of a nation			1
@entity378 , @entity388 at the @entity39 , says : ' we want visitors to consider the role of propaganda in their own lives today , as well as look at the state ’s use of propaganda throughout history			1
' that ’s why , as well as displaying iconic pieces of propaganda from the @entity39 ’s collections , such as posters from both @entity407 , the @entity401 and @entity402 , we ’ll also be focusing on more surprising examples , such as the @entity409 and even @entity410 – things you would n’t necessarily associate with a word like " propaganda " '			1
the exhibition runs until september 17 at the @entity39 , @entity46 .			1
