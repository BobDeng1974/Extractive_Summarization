a @entity1 mother and stepfather who murdered her four - year - old son using ' unimaginable acts of cruelty and brutality ' have lost an appeal against their 30 - year prison sentences			1
' callous and wretched ' @entity10 , 27 , and @entity10 , 34 , killed @entity10 after they force - fed him salt , beat him and locked him in a tiny room in a 13 - month campaign of torture			1
the couple , jailed for life in august last year , claimed their sentences were ' excessive ' but a legal challenge was thrown out by the @entity21 today			1
' @entity22 and wretched ' : @entity10 , 27 , and @entity10 , 34 , killed her son @entity10 after they tortured him and locked him in a tiny room - but they claimed their 30 - year sentences were ' excessive ' shocking : the murder of four - year - old @entity10 was described as one of the worst to ever come before the @entity31 courts three judges in @entity33 also rejected a bid by @entity10 to appeal against his murder conviction - describing his application as ' unarguable '			1
@entity37 , announcing the decision of the court today , said the trial judge was ' fully entitled to treat this as one of the most serious offences of murder to come before the courts '			2
she described the story of @entity10 's suffering and death as ' heartbreaking '			1
@entity10 suffered ‘ chronic and systematic ’ starvation , which stopped him growing and left him a ‘ bag of bones ’			2
she added : ‘ he was literally wasting away			0
’ he weighed less than a toddler and stood six inches smaller than average when he died a few months short of his fifth birthday with at least 30 injuries to his emaciated body			1
@entity10 beat @entity10 around the head and then the couple left him to die alone on march 3 , 2012 , even having sex as he lay unconscious			1
the judge in their murder trial said : ' harrowing details of the unimaginable acts of cruelty and brutality inflicted on little @entity10 , over many months , have exposed both the torment and despair he must have suffered and your callous disregard for his pain and distress '			1
a @entity72 into the death found @entity10 was effectively ‘ invisible ’ to officials in @entity75 , who failed to speak to the @entity1 child about a home life in which he was starved , poisoned with salt and held in a bath until he passed out			2
police were called to his home 27 times in his short life as his drunk mother got into violent rows with various lovers , often with the schoolboy watching			0
before his death @entity10 resembled a ‘ concentration camp victim ’ , weighed just 11kg and was so hungry teachers saw him eating food from bins and the school sandpit			0
the report concluded ' at no point were practitioners who had contact with him prepared to think the unthinkable and consider that he might be suffering abuse '			0
@entity10 ’s minimum term of 30 years is one of the longest jail terms given to a woman in @entity31			1
it is the same as child - killer @entity105 and is exceeded by only @entity106 and @entity107			0
convicted killers : @entity109 , @entity10 's mother , and his stepfather @entity10 who were found guilty of murder by a jury at @entity114			1
@entity10 failed to get that overturned prison : the tiny unfurnished box room that @entity10 was locked in for hours on end			0
the door had been tampered with so @entity10 could not get out filthy : a dirty mattress @entity10 was forced to sleep on during his confinement in the box room in his home in @entity75 murdered schoolboy : the catalogue of injuries inflicted on little @entity10 , which were found when his body was examined yet at the time not one professional who came into contact with @entity10 and his mother and stepfather from his school , social services , the @entity128 or the police has been disciplined			2
@entity37 , sitting with mr @entity136 and mr @entity137 , said @entity10 was subjected in the months before his death to a campaign of escalating cruelty including starvation			2
' that anyone could treat a child this way is incomprehensible			0
that his mother and stepfather could is beyond any belief and understanding			0
' ' in the context of weeks , if not months , of sustained cruelty designed to cause suffering to a four - year - old child , culminating in that child 's death , in our judgment , a lack of intention to kill adds very little by way of mitigation			1
' it was not a case where a child died as a result of one blow , because of an unexpected burst of anger by an uncaring parent , but where there was at least one final fatal bow to an already ' dreadfully abused and neglected child '			2
even after that blow was administered , help was not sought until it was far too late , said the judge			0
' both applicants were plainly far more concerned about their own future and their own responsibility than about getting help to a dying child			0
' this was an extraordinarily serious case of its type and , in our view , clearly justified the impositon of a very long minimum term			0
' that is what they received , and we do not find that the sentence was in any way excessive			0

after 13 months of torture @entity10 died after *massive* blow to the head
@entity10 and @entity10 found guilty of murdering him
couple claimed 30 - year jail sentences for ' brutal ' killing were ' excessive '
judges threw out appeal calling case one of the worst ever seen by courts
@entity10 's appeal against murder conviction rejected as ' unarguable '
