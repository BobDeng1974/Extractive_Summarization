by @entity0 published : 19:11 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 05:20 est , 7 march 2014 clutching a razor - sharp bayonet , the @entity3 infantryman peered nervously over the parapet of the @entity7 trench and into @entity8			1
less than 100 yards away was the enemy frontline - conjuring up terrifying images of the hearing the sergeant ’s shrill whistle , going ‘ over the top ’ , and risking death charging headlong into a hail of murderous @entity18 machine gun fire			2
but rifleman @entity19 , 35 , serving with the 4th @entity20 , was not preparing to make the ultimate sacrifice , and this was not the @entity7			0
history : @entity19 , of @entity24 @entity20 , inspects the front line trench of a newly discovered practice ww1 battlefield in @entity27 , @entity28			1
historians say it is the best - preserved of its kind ever found instead , a century after the start of the bloody 1914 - 18 conflict , historians have discovered an entire mock battlefield used to train tens of thousands of troops about to deploy to the @entity37			1
covering an area the size of 17 football pitches in @entity27 , @entity28 , the site contains the remains of two opposing trench systems , each with a 200 - metre long frontline , supply trenches and dug - outs , separated by a @entity8			1
training : modern - day soldiers stand in the site , which was only discovered last year by a council employee experts say the site , on heathland , is the best preserved example of its kind in the @entity3			1
brave young men from across the @entity3 , @entity55 and the @entity56 would have travelled to the training ground learn how to fight in the mud and cold of the trenches			1
instructors would have taught soldiers how to run quickly along the trenches - dug in a zig - zag to reduce the deadly risk of direct hits from shells – go ‘ over the top ’ , put on gas masks and face live fire			1
pieces of exploded grenade are still being found at the site			0
but over the years @entity74 became overgrown with gorse bushes and forgotten , used by local people for picnics			0
@entity78 – who has fought in @entity79 – said standing in the practice trenches had given him an inkling of the conditions endured by his forebears in the infantry			2
he said : ‘ it ’s difficult walking up and down the trenches today so to do it in a war would be something else			2
going over the top would be pretty scary			0
i have loads of respect for the guys in the @entity7			0
’ the site was discovered in autumn by @entity96 , a conservation officer with @entity27 , who spotted a set of strange lines on an aerial photograph from the 1950s and went to investigate			1
mr @entity96 , 48 , said : ‘ i found myself walking along a ditch and realised it was part of an elaborate trench system , hidden for all these years by bracken and gorse			0
i looked around and there were trenches everywhere			2
it ’s quite jaw - dropping			2
‘ it brings home a sense of loss and emotion			0
i have five relatives buried on the @entity37			0
did any of them train here ? so many soldiers must have passed through on their way to sacrifice their lives			2
’ tv historian @entity118 , president of the @entity119 , said : ‘ i never thought i would see something this large in the @entity3			1
it 's an entire replica @entity7 battlefield			2
tens of thousands of soldiers would have trained in the mock battlefield , the size of 17 football pitches			1
pictured : soldiers led by @entity130 reservist captain @entity131 retrace the steps of those 100 years ago ‘ it shows how seriously @entity3 took the business of training			1
they had to send the guys to @entity138 ready to do the hardest of tasks , to defeat the @entity18 army when they were dug in with deep trenches , artillery , machine guns and they had to break that deadlock			1
‘ this shows that these guys were n’t just rounded up from industrial towns and carted to the western front to be chucked at the machineguns			2
they were learning new tactics and techniques and using new equipment , and this gave them the best chance of success and , ultimately victory			0
‘ the training experience would have been as realistic as possible : cold , wet , sleep deprivation , dodgy food , people firing live ammunition			0
it would have got the troops used to all the sounds and smells of battle			0
but by the end of the war the @entity130 was the finest in the world			0
’ @entity169 , @entity170 ’s @entity7 expert , said : ‘ buildings from @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity171 times … these are all well documented			0
but the built history of the @entity7 in @entity177 is virtually a blank chapter			0
’ experts are now working to map and record the practice battlefield for posterity as well as trying to discover which regiments might have trained there			1
battleground : tv historian @entity118 ( left ) said : ' it shows how seriously @entity3 took the business of training ' the find marks the start of @entity189 1914 - 18 , a project on which @entity170 and the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) are working together to document and record key sites on the home front that helped @entity3 win the @entity7			1
they are trying to identify former drill halls , requisitioned factories and farm buildings , pill boxes , secret listening stations , prisoner - of - war camps and gun emplacements			0
the aim of the @entity189 1914 - 18 campaign is to bring marry national expertise with people ’s local knowledge to record the remains of the war in the @entity3			1
