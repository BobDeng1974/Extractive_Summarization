' miss @entity4 has since denied being pregnant - but not before the claim spread across the @entity32 following a post on @entity23 from a @entity2 blogger called @entity25			1
and it quickly began to gain momentum , with former @entity39 mp @entity38 writing : ‘ @entity2 blogger tweeting source says @entity16 4 months pregnant ; @entity19 evidently not first lady any more			1
’ a spokesman for @entity12 denied ‘ any knowledge ’ of the rumour			2
an @entity18 spokesman said he had ‘ no comment ’ on ‘ such a matter ’			0
miss @entity19 , 48 , has been in hospital since friday suffering from ‘ extreme shock ’ over the affair revelations			1
but in a press conference yesterday , mr @entity6 made no mention of his partner of seven years , refusing to say whether she was still @entity42 and furiously denouncing questions about his ‘ painful ’ love life			2
addressing the nation , he proclaimed himself ‘ totally indignant ’ that his affair had been exposed			0
' distraught ' @entity59 , 48 , was admitted for treatment following the publication of photographs of the @entity2 leader sneaking in and out of his love - nest on the back of a moped waving his hands in frustration , he said it was a private matter which of the women was now his partner at the @entity18 – a role that is estimated to cost @entity2 taxpayers £ 70,000 a month			1
he contemptuously indicated he would make up his mind before a state visit to @entity76 just before @entity77			0
at a scheduled twice - yearly press conference , the first question was : ‘ @entity19 , is she still today the @entity42 of @entity2 ? ’ mr @entity6 pointedly refused to back his long - term love , saying only : ‘ each and every one of us , in their personal lives , can go through difficult periods			1
and that ’s our case			0
‘ but i have one principle , which is that private matters are dealt with privately , within a respectful intimacy			0
so therefore it is neither the time or the place to do so			0
’ he added he would answer ‘ any questions on this particular subject ’ ahead of his state visit to @entity93 and @entity94 on february 11			0
@entity2 president @entity6 has refused to answer whether his long - term girlfriend @entity19 is still @entity2 's first lady as he faced the world 's media for the first time since the news broke , the 59 - year - old remained tight - lipped during questioning from journalists intriguingly , an @entity18 spokesman would not say to today whether mr @entity6 had even visited his de fact first lady in hospital , where ms @entity19 has so far spent four nights the @entity109 made it clear at @entity18 press conference in @entity111 that he had not made up his mind who he wanted to be with			1
he said : ' everyone of us can go through difficult periods in our personal life and that is our case			0
they are painful moments , but i have one principle and that is that private matters are dealt with privately within a respectful intimacy			0
therefore it is nether the time nor the place to do so			0
' asked if he would tighten @entity2 's already very strict privacy laws , mr @entity6 said : ' no , i am against changing laws for personal convenience			1
' but my outrage is total			0
we are a country of great freedoms in @entity2 , but we do have a respect for private life and for human dignity			2
' in words which may be considered extremely cruel by both women , mr @entity6 even confirmed that the presidential partner had ' no official status ' in @entity2 , and he was determined to keep costs down , whoever was confirmed as first lady			1
when questioned if his security had ever been compromised as suggested by some reports about his affair , mr @entity6 answered : ' when i travel officially and when i travel on a private basis , i have protection that is less suffocating			2
but i am protected everywhere			0
' when later in the two - hour press conference he was asked again who the @entity2 first lady was , he lost his cool , telling 600 assembled journalists from around the world he deplored last week ’s expose of his infidelity in @entity2 closer magazine			1
‘ my outrage is total			0
i am totally indignant , and it is not only personally that i ’m indignant – it is a violation that affects a fundamental freedom , and could involve all of you , ’ he said , pointing			0
‘ we are a country of great freedoms in @entity2 , but we do have a respect for private life and for human dignity			2
’ @entity2 journalists failed to grill him on why he had chosen to have his trysts in an apartment which has links to the @entity175 mafia			2
and he was let off lightly about the fact that @entity59 , as first lady , has five members of staff , her own chauffeur and the use of private jets and limousines			0
in words which may be considered extremely cruel by some , unmarried mr @entity6 claimed the presidential partner had ‘ no official status ’ in @entity2 , and said he was determined to keep costs down , whoever was confirmed as first lady			1
the role was just a ‘ habit ’ , he suggested			0
but he did acknowledge that @entity59 was on the public payroll and said : ‘ for me , what is essential is transparency			0
’ despite mr @entity6 ’s protestations of an ‘ invasion ’ of privacy , miss @entity19 has been supplying daily briefings on her condition in hospital to @entity2 newspaper @entity202			1
she told the paper she was ready to forgive her partner , if only he would make his intentions clear quickly			0
yesterday the newspaper claimed mr @entity6 wanted to announce his separation from miss @entity19 – for whom he left the mother of his four children – but is scared to do so while she is in hospital			1
today in answer to a question from a journalist about the closer magazine photos mr @entity6 said he is outraged by the violation of his privacy , but says he will not sue mr @entity6 added that ' my indignation is total ' and the report is a ' violation that touches a personal liberty ' @entity2 president @entity6 gives a press conference to present his 2014 policy plans at the @entity18 presidential palace in @entity111 as mr @entity6 spoke to the world 's press this mock - up appeared on the internet of the prime minster wearing a helmet photoshopped over his head , similar to the one he was seen wearing in @entity231 magazine a tweet from journalist @entity233 questioning the @entity2 first lady 's status ‘ some have advised him to make an announcement of a split , but the hospitalisation of @entity19 convinced him to give it time , ’ one friend told the publication			1
an @entity18 spokesman would not say whether mr @entity6 had visited @entity59 in hospital			2
there is nothing physically wrong with her , but she said mr @entity6 ’s confession of cheating was like ‘ being hit by a high - speed train ’ , and she is desperate to win public sympathy			2
bizarrely , though , it is mr @entity6 whose public ratings have risen as a result of the scandal – among women at least			2
an opinion poll for @entity258 magazine showed his approval among women had jumped from 23 per cent in december to 26 per cent now			0
it has been claimed the pair met at a £ 2.5million @entity111 love nest , registered to writer and actor @entity263 @entity4 ( left ) with @entity265 ( right )			1
the flat is registered to @entity263 , who is a former lover of the @entity2 actress @entity265 , who now uses the flat with their children meanwhile , despite being highly recognisable as one of @entity2 ’s most famous film stars , divorced miss @entity4 has gone into hiding			1
the actress , who has starred in several erotic movies in the past , has two teenage sons			0
her ex-husband , @entity278 screenwriter @entity277 , 51 , yesterday described her as ‘ very calm and confident ’ as she hid away from the media storm			0
he said she was a ‘ sublime actress , who works a lot , a mother who cares for her children , ’ insisting there was ‘ no fault , no deception ’ on her part			0
she has indicated that she is prepared to forgive president @entity6 for his affair with an actress , even though she felt she had been ' hit by a high speed train ' when first told about it			2
but @entity18 sources in turn said ms @entity19 solely wanted to hold on to a position which ensured her wealth , fame and huge public influence @entity19 ( left ) became mr @entity6 ’s live - in girlfriend following his separation from @entity301 , the mother of his four children			1
but her place in the president ’s affections have been taken by @entity4 ( right ) these black and white photographs show a topless @entity4 in a photo shoot in 1998 since early last year , mr @entity6 has been making visits to his love nest on the back of a moped , using a crash helmet as a disguise			1
an armed bodyguard working for one of @entity2 ’s elite police units was tasked with bringing morning croissants to the lovers following their trysts			2
but @entity320 , the photographer who caught mr @entity6 sneaking in and out of the apartment , claimed yesterday the president ’s 63 - man security team would leave him alone overnight .			1
