a study of 75 popular products by which ? found that leading stores routinely use multi-buy promotions and special offers to wrongly give shoppers the impression that they are saving money			0
in one case , shoppers at @entity19 buying two packs of a popular yoghurt during a promotion paid £ 1 more than if they had bought them beforehand			1
under another special offer , customers were paying 50 per cent more for a packet of rice			2
with falling wages and higher bills eating into households ’ disposable income , many hard - pressed families are looking to save money on their groceries			0
four in ten say they are likely to cut back on food spending in the next few months , according to which ? , while 81 per cent say they are looking out for supermarket deals to help them save money			0
but the which ? research suggests such deals are not all they seem , despite eight of the leading retailers signing up to a new code to deliver honest prices			0
@entity19 , which was the only major chain not to adopt the guidance on how to describe offers , was found to have raised the headline price for a four - carton pack of @entity53 from £ 1.50 to £ 2.18 – before introducing a ‘ 2 for £ 4 ’ multi-buy promotion			2
@entity19 also increased the regular price of @entity57 ’s @entity56 from £ 1 to £ 1.58 as it went on a ‘ 2 for £ 3 ’ offer , a 50 per cent hike			1
misleading ? researchers found stores like @entity63 's put up prices for seven days , then offer ' cut price ' for months difficult : families are trying to cut their spend on food but confusing supermarket deals make it difficult which ? found that @entity63 ’s sold packs of @entity72 at £ 1.80 for just seven days before launching an offer that stated ‘ was £ 1.80 now 90p ’ , which ran for 84 days			1
similarly , @entity74 sold @entity76 spray at an ‘ original ’ price of £ 2 for just 17 days , before selling at a ‘ half - price ’ of £ 1 for 47 days			1
which ? is demanding an end to misleading deals , clear rules on what defines an offer and tougher enforcement			0

we ’re saying it ’s time to make @entity91			0
’ the supermarkets blamed the examples identified by which ? on simple mistakes while the new code was introduced , rather than a deliberate attempt to fool customers			2
@entity19 said : ‘ sometimes mistakes can happen , but we would never deliberately mislead our customers – our aim is always to offer the lowest prices for the longest			1

which ? found major supermarkets put up prices for a week then cut them
@entity63 's sold £ 1 *handwash* for £ 1.80 then had ' half price offer ' at 90p
@entity19 claims ' mistakes happen but we would never mislead our customers '
