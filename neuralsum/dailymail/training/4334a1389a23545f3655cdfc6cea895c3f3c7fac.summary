advances in @entity4 man ’s language and culture , might have been driven by climate change , scientists claim			1
scientists believe surges in innovation in early modern human populations coincided with periods of heavy rainfall			1
people living in the @entity13 , between 80,000 and 40,000 years ago , in an area that is now @entity15 , used symbols to communicate , which have been linked to the development of complex language			2
people living in the @entity13 , between 80,000 and 40,000 years ago , in a region that now included @entity15 ( pictured ) , used symbols to communicate , which have been linked to the development of complex language , more in times of heavy rainfall scientists from @entity25 of @entity26 and @entity27 , the @entity28 in @entity29 and the @entity30 , said that these symbols , as well as personal adornments made of seashells , coincided with increased rainfall and receded in dry periods			1
they studied a marine sediment core off the coast of @entity15 and reconstructed terrestrial climate variability over the last 100,000 years to come up with their findings , which were published in the journal @entity42			1
dr @entity43 , of @entity25 , said : ‘ we found that @entity15 experienced rapid climate transitions toward wetter conditions at times when the @entity48 experienced extremely cold conditions			1
’ professor @entity50 , also of @entity25 said : ‘ when the timing of these rapidly occurring wet pulses was compared with the archaeological datasets , we found remarkable coincidences			2
bifacial points recovered from @entity56 , @entity15 are pictured			2
the tools were made during the @entity13 by anatomically modern humans			0
the scale bar measures 5cm scientists found that the disappearance of industries including decorating seashells and ' writing ' symbols , appears to coincide with the transition to drier climatic conditions ( illustrated ) people living in the @entity13 , between 80,000 and 40,000 years ago , in an area that now lies in @entity15 , used symbols to communicate , which have been linked to the development of complex language			1
scientists said that these symbols , as well as personal adornments made of seashells , coincided with increased rainfall and receded in dry periods			1
the occurrence of several major @entity13 industries fell tightly together with the onset of periods with increased rainfall			1
the disappearance of the industries appears to coincide with the transition to drier climatic conditions , they said			0
the @entity15 archaeological record is so important because it shows some of the oldest evidence for modern behaviour in early humans			2
‘ the occurrence of several major @entity13 industries fell tightly together with the onset of periods with increased rainfall			1
‘ similarly , the disappearance of the industries appears to coincide with the transition to drier climatic conditions			0
’ large @entity48 cooling events have previously been linked to a change in the @entity93 circulation that led to a reduced transport of warm water to the high latitudes in the north			0
in response to the @entity48 cooling , large parts of the @entity99 experienced very dry conditions			0
dr @entity43 said : ‘ our new data however , contrasts with @entity99 and demonstrates that the @entity15 climate responded in the opposite direction , with increasing rainfall , that can be associated with a globally occurring southward shift of the tropical monsoon belt			2
’ the @entity15 archaeological record is so important because it shows some of the oldest evidence for modern behaviour in early humans			0
professor @entity113 of @entity28 , @entity29 , said : ‘ the correspondence between climatic ameliorations and cultural innovations supports the view that population growth fuelled cultural changes , through increased human interactions			0
‘ the quality of the @entity123 data allowed us to make these correlations between climate and behavioural change , but it will require comparable data from other areas before we can say whether this region was uniquely important in the development of modern human culture			0
’ the study examines a time in prehistoric history far before the @entity135 , some 6,000 to 2,000 years ago			0
people living at this time were known to carve representative pictures into rock , epitomised by famous engravings in the @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity15			0

*research* led by @entity25 found that increased use of @entity4 symbols and seashell decorations coincided with increased rainfall
innovation by @entity4 men in what is now @entity15 decreased in dry periods with little rainfall
scientists reconstructed climate variability over the last 100,000 years
