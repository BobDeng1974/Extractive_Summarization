by @entity1 reporter wolves are prowling into @entity3 in their largest numbers for more than a century after a spate of mysterious sheep massacres that has spread fear through farms across the continent			1
scientists in @entity11 made the revelation after a mysterious creature found dead by the side of a road was revealed to be the country 's first wolf in 150 years			1
meanwhile in @entity19 , 50 wolf - pack raids were recorded in @entity19 last year alone despite the fact that the country 's supposed ' last wolf ' was shot dead in 1904			1
making a comeback : last year alone , 50 wolf - pack raids were recorded in @entity19 leaving farmers fearing for their livelihoods			1
@entity19 's ' last wolf ' was shot dead in 1904 ' most @entity32 countries have signed the 1979 @entity34 convention which prohibits the killing of wolves , ' @entity27 , a biologist who monitors the growing wolf population in @entity19 ’s @entity30 region , told @entity37			1
' in @entity3 , the wolf is at the top of the predatory chain			1
it has no enemies except humans			0
we have not reached the legal limit in wolf numbers which would allow for culling , so the species is , by its nature , destined to spread across the continent , ' she added			2
@entity32 heartland : traditionally , @entity3 has nine wolf population zones including @entity54 , the @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , south - eastern @entity58 , @entity59 and the @entity60 in @entity61 the wolves are coming : traditionally , @entity3 has nine wolf population zones including @entity54 , the @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , south - eastern @entity58 , @entity59 and the @entity60 in @entity61 last week , a wolf , was run over and killed by a car near the @entity66 hamlet of @entity67 , just 30 miles from @entity11 ’s densely populated @entity69 coast			1
wolves were abundant throughout the forests of mainland @entity3 during the 18th century			1
but a vast cull all but wiped them out in all central and northern @entity32 countries during the 19th century and the post @entity75 period			0
survivors of that cull remain in pockets in @entity79 , @entity61 , @entity59 , @entity80 and @entity81 , though the largest populations are now found in eastern @entity3 , primarily in @entity57 , the @entity83 and @entity56			2
there is now an estimated population of between 18,000 and 25,000 wolves left in the wilds of @entity3			2
they tend mostly to hunt in large packs , relying on a keen sense of smell and teamwork to catch prey , from moose to deer to wild boar			0
when chasing prey , they run at around 40mph ; not particularly fast compared with big cats			0
but they can keep going for an hour , chasing and chasing until their quarry runs out of steam			0
they listen to their prey ’s heartbeat from several metres away with their uncannily ­ powerful hearing and can judge when it is petrified — the moment they decide to go in for the kill			0
they are also highly intelligent			2
packs have been known to fill their mouths with snow when stalking so that their breath does not steam in the cold — which might give them away to their prey			0
they have been considered so rare in the area that the possibility it was a wolf was almost ruled out until test were carried out by biologists			0
@entity19 , however , has experienced a sharp rise in wolf - pack attacks forcing farmers to resort to ever - more extreme methods of protecting their sheep			1
for many farmers , electric fences are not enough forcing some to pay up to 3,000 @entity132 for @entity134 sheepdogs who live among the flock and bark loudly when wolves appear			0
but experts say attacks on humans are rare and wolves are generally as scared of people as people are of them			0
scientists attribute the rise of wolves in @entity3 to the fall of the @entity147 in 1989 when they were made a protected species			1
wolves started entering @entity30 from @entity56 in the 1990s using rusting machinery and vast and desolate former @entity152 training grounds left over from the @entity153 as their home			0
traditionally , @entity3 has nine wolf population zones including @entity54 , the @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , south - eastern @entity58 , @entity59 and the @entity60 in @entity61			1
the first clue that wolves were breeding in @entity19 came in 2000 when an infra red camera picked up a male and female caring for a tiny cub for the first time			2
@entity19 ’s ' last wolf ' was shot dead in 1904 while @entity164 has not seen a one on its shores for more than 200 years			1
wolves live with their cubs for about two years until their offspring mature enough to move on and form a new pack elsewhere			2
' this happens when the wolf population is too large to be sustained by the deer and boar which live around it and which are its natural food supply , ' said ms @entity27 .			0

last year , 50 wolf - pack raids on farms were recorded in @entity19
comes as beast found dead on @entity66 road in country 's first wolf in 150yrs
scientists attribute the rise of wolves in @entity3 to the fall of @entity147
an earlier *version* of this article *contained* a *headline* that *suggested* wolves may *imminently* arrive in @entity164 . in fact , this is highly unlikely to be the case .
