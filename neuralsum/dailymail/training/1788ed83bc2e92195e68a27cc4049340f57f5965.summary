@entity0 has told @entity2 ’s players they under - performed at the @entity3 and should have at least got out of the group			1
the new @entity6 assistant manager predicted @entity8 ’s squad would struggle in @entity9 before the tournament began but even he admits : ‘ i did n’t think they ’d struggle that much , to be fair			1
’ yet @entity0 defended @entity12 and dismissed claims by @entity14 , his former midfield partner at @entity15 , that the 28 - year - old striker might be past his peak			1
@entity12 drew criticism from some quarters for his performance in the less familiar left - wing position against @entity34 , despite setting up @entity36 ’s goal			1
@entity0 is still supportive of @entity12 , who then scored an equaliser against @entity38 , but he still believes the striker could have made a bigger impression ‘ i thought he did okay , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ there was a lot rolled into his position			0
@entity2 scored two and he got one of them			1
i ’m sure @entity12 , like lots of the players , will feel he could have done better			2
top players are always quick to look at themselves , they are quite self - critical			2
’ it was @entity0 ’s analysis of @entity2 as a whole that drew deeper criticism			1
in his final appearance as an @entity60 pundit , at the @entity57 final , @entity0 prompted nervous laughter from @entity2 captain @entity62 alongside him by stating : ‘ i do think they ’ll struggle			1
’ speaking now , @entity0 says : ‘ that ’s not football knowledge			1
that ’s just common sense			0
’ more to come ? despite scoring against @entity38 , @entity12 could 've contributed more according to @entity0 killer blow : @entity38 's @entity68 scored the goals which effectively ended the @entity71 's hopes in @entity9 glum : @entity12 looks dejected after @entity2 's second group stage defeat of the tournament to @entity38 but watching @entity8 ’s team finish bottom of @entity76 , with defeats to @entity34 and @entity38 and a goalless draw with @entity79 , was a shock			1
@entity0 , 42 , has first - hand experience of @entity79 in his role as @entity84 assistant under @entity85 because the sides drew 1 - 1 in a friendly last month			1
‘ if you had said they were going to top that group i ’d have said you were mad , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but they ’ve obviously done well			0
they ’ve adapted to the conditions			0
whatever ’s happened with @entity2 , the players did n’t perform			2
‘ in most championships in recent years they ’ve just not peaked at the right time			0
you can argue all day about winter breaks and the rest of it but they should ’ve done better			0
they should ’ve got out of the group			0
’ expectations were low after a mediocre @entity100 and @entity99 chairman @entity98 symbolised the feeling with a cut - throat gesture when the @entity3 draw was made			1
@entity104 man : @entity107 flop @entity105 helped @entity79 top @entity76 and reach the quarter - finals against @entity110 surprise package : @entity79 were expected to struggle but have already reached the last eight in @entity9 @entity0 believes the squad was short of experienced winners			1
of the starting line - up against @entity34 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 are yet to win major silverware , with subs @entity120 and @entity122 in the same position			0
‘ i still look at their group and maybe a lot of them lack that vital experience , whether it be @entity57 or big - game experience , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ people are ranting and raving about some of their bigger players but they still have a lot to do			0
it ’s not their fault but some of the younger players are yet to win a trophy			0
yet people expect them to go to the @entity3 and get to the quarters or semis			2
’ @entity0 aired his views while being unveiled as @entity144 ’s assistant at @entity6 and the outspoken @entity145 used the occasion to reveal that he thinks it would have been impossible to continue giving tv criticism while working in football			1
his views offer perspective on @entity152 ’s decision to work as an analyst for @entity154 while coaching with @entity2			2
lots to learn : @entity0 believes the inexperience of players like @entity117 had a part to play in @entity2 's downfall next level : @entity118 ( right ) is yet to win a major trophy or play in the @entity57 return ? @entity0 has not ruled out working as a pundit for @entity60 again after pulling out of his @entity3 duties ‘ i really enjoyed @entity60			1
it kept me busy , got to some good matches , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i just felt the time had come			0
i ’m not saying i would n’t get back into it			0
getting back with the @entity145 team , i felt awkward sometimes doing one or two matches where there were @entity145 players			0
there was maybe a little bit of conflict			0
‘ i felt it could have been awkward for one or two other players i was maybe working with or commentating on and i did n’t want that issue			0
but good luck to @entity152 , we ’re all different			0
i did n’t want to have any compromise regarding my role in football with punditry			2
the half - measure was n’t working for me			0
’ and will he be the next @entity6 boss ? there were certainly no half - measures on that subject			1
‘ no , absolutely not , ’ he said .			0

@entity0 believes @entity12 has plenty more to give for @entity15 and @entity2
the striker was criticised by his former @entity15 team - mate @entity14
@entity0 expected @entity2 to struggle at the @entity3 but was still surprised by their early exit
the @entity2 lack experience at the *highest* level according to the new @entity6 assistant manager
the 42 - year - old could return to his role as a football pundit for @entity60
