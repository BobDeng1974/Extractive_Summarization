copycats : a commercial satellite flying over the @entity2 photographed what appears to be a replica of a @entity5 under construction at a ship yard near @entity8 , @entity9 @entity9 is in the process of building a mock - up of an @entity12 @entity5 with the possible goal of blowing it up as a publicity stunt			1
construction on the crude model appears to be in full swing at a shipyard near @entity8 , as shown in newly released commercial satellite images			1
' they got this barge and threw some wood on top of it to make it look like the @entity27			0
that 's all we know for sure , ' a @entity12 defense official told @entity31			2
officials in the @entity34 administration believe that the faux carrier might be used for propaganda value , but they are not sure at this time what @entity38 is hoping to accomplish with this project			0
the wooden , non-operational aircraft carrier made to look like a nimitz - class nuclear - powered @entity12 vessel was first spotted on the @entity2 last summer , the @entity41 reported			1
besides having the shape of the 1,100 - foot - long carriers , such as @entity48 and @entity49 , the shipbuilders also replicated the distinctive white markings on the bow			1
a satellite flying over @entity54 shipyard also photographed a fake plane parked on the deck of the equally fake carrier			2
but officials are not overly concerned with the boxy , too - short replica , saying that unlike the real thing , @entity9 's glorified barge is not operational or propelled by nuclear power			2
the real thing : the @entity63 has ten nimitz - class aircraft carriers , which are 1,100 feet in length and feature a nuclear propulsion system it still remains a mystery what @entity38 is planning to do with the copy once it is complete			1
one theory is that the @entity73 - inspired vessel could be towed to sea and detonated , with the explosion shown on state tv for anti-american propaganda purposes			0
according to the @entity41 , @entity9 has used barges for televised missile target practice in the past			0
@entity80 's in the details : @entity9 shipbuilders supplied their glorified barge with white markings characteristic of @entity27 carriers , but officials are certain that the fake vessel is not operational and has no nuclear power @entity89 reported that in june , @entity9 launched its overhauled destroyer named @entity91 , but @entity12 analysts are convinced that the @entity94 nation is not capable of building an aircraft carrier			1
‘ it is not surprising that @entity9 naval forces might use a variety of tactics -- including military deception tactics -- to communicate and possibly demonstrate their resolve in the region , ’ said another @entity12 official			0
the revelations concerning the barge come four months after @entity38 came to a temporary agreement with the world powers over its nuclear program , parts of which are expected to be rolled back in exchange for an end to some economic sanctions , according to @entity114			0
tensions between @entity9 and the @entity12 have been at an all - time low recently , and over the past year , there have been fewer @entity9 speedboats pestering @entity12 warships in the @entity119			2
on thursday , president @entity34 sent a message to the @entity9 people to mark the @entity2 @entity122 , saying that he is ' committed to diplomacy			0
