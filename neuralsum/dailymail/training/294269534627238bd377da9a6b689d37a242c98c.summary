by @entity0 , chief political correspondent published : 20:14 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 08:12 est , 9 september 2013 the chancellor , pictured , will hail ' dramatic improvement in financial conditions ' in recent months , in his most upbeat assessment of @entity6 's economic outlook since the election @entity6 's economy is ‘ turning a corner ’ and making a sustained recovery from @entity13 ’s ‘ @entity12 ’ , @entity8 will say today			1
the chancellor will hail ‘ dramatic improvement in financial conditions ’ in recent months , in his most upbeat assessment of @entity6 ’s economic outlook since the election			1
in a speech to economists , he will say the recovery has ‘ decisively ended ’ debate over whether the country should heed @entity13 ’s call to abandon spending cuts and switch to a ‘ @entity23 ’			2
he will also dismiss warnings that the recovery is being driven by an unsustainable consumer boom			0
signs of growth vindicate the @entity30 ’s decision to stick with its austerity programme – which still has years to run – despite intense pressure from @entity13 and left - wing economists to drop it			1
he will say : ‘ the plan is working , but more years of hard decisions lie ahead			0
our economy is turning a corner , but we must not take anything for granted			0
’ taking aim at shadow chancellor @entity41 and others who have called for a spending spree to boost growth , mr @entity8 will say : ‘ those in favour of @entity23 have lost the argument			1
’ he will point out that @entity6 ’s growth , now forecast to be the best in the developed world in the second half of this year , has happened at the same time as the programme of cuts			1
‘ government spending cuts have continued as planned , and yet growth has accelerated and many of the leading economic indicators show activity rising faster than at any time since the 1990s , ’ he will say			1
mr @entity8 will say that it was external factors , such as the eurozone crisis and soaring commodity prices , which had held back growth since the election , rather than the programme of austerity			1
he is also expected to pledge that all sections of society , and all parts of the country , will benefit from the recovery			0
his bullish tone reflects growing confidence the economy is on course for a sustained recovery in the run - up to the next election			2
in the three months to june , it grew by 0.6 per cent – double the figure in the previous three months , and the respected @entity82 think - tank last week upgraded its 2013 growth forecast for the @entity6 from 0.8 per cent to 1.5 per cent			1
shadow chancellor @entity41 had wanted a spending spree to boost growth one senior government source said the @entity6 was now out of the ‘ @entity88 bucket ’ , with growth prospects comparable to those of the @entity91			2
the chancellor will say there is evidence of a ‘ broad - based and sustainable recovery ’ , with business surveys suggesting all sectors of the economy are enjoying growth , and that only half of the growth this year was driven by consumer spending			2
but he will warn : ‘ more tough choices will be required after the next election to find many billions of further savings , and anyone who thinks those decisions can be ducked is not fit for government			2
’ but @entity109 will use his speech to the @entity111 tomorrow to say : ‘ living standards have been falling for longer than at any time since 1870			0
only the privileged few are feeling better off			0
‘ this is an unfair recovery			0
this is an unequal recovery			0
and an unequal recovery wo n’t be a stable recovery			0
