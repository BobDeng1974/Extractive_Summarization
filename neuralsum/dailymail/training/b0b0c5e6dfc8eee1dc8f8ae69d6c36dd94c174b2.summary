by @entity0 published : 12:28 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 12:37 est , 18 march 2014 it has been visited by big names such as @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , but the majority of guests at this ‘ @entity10 hot spot ’ are not dropping in voluntarily , and there certainly is no vip section			0

@entity18 handles more than 100,000 arrests a year , averaging about 70 to 90 cases during the 5pm - 1am night session			1
it is one of @entity14 's more peculiar and paradoxical tourist traditions , a place visitors extol on travel websites while many residents hope never to wind up there			1
to travelers , it is a form of gritty entertainment , hard - knocks education or at least a chance to experience real - life law and order on a @entity14 scale			1
dozens of jurisdictions nationwide hold nightly court sessions , but thanks to television series such as @entity69 and @entity70 , as well as arraignments of real - life celebrities , from rapper @entity4 to former child actress @entity74 , @entity18 has become famous in its own right			1
no model behaviour : supermodel @entity77 is escorted from @entity18 in 2007 after pleading guilty to assaulting her housekeeper with a mobile phone hairspray - ed : actress @entity74 made some interesting sartorial choices for her court appearance on on reckless endangerment charges ' it 's very interesting to hear real cases , ’ @entity83 , a 26 - year - old tourist from @entity84 , @entity85 , said as she watched judge decide whether to set bail for people facing charges ranging from choking a girlfriend to stealing a six - pack of beer			1
each case is handled in a matter of minutes amid a hive of clerks shuffling paperwork , police taking retinal scans , defendants and lawyers conferring in a confessional - sized glass booth and court officers occasionally bellowing , ‘ @entity105 , please ! ’ established in 1907 , @entity10 night court once attracted such spectators as @entity108 and the then - @entity109			1
more recently , it 's been noted in tour books , including a mention in the off - the - beaten - path @entity115 guide			0
‘ this is something that feels really underground and unique , ’ said @entity116 , author of the current @entity115 @entity14 book			2
night court is so popular that veteran clerk @entity124 has become an impromptu tour guide for school groups from as far away as @entity127 , judges from @entity121 and individual sightseers he spots in the audience			2
‘ i try to make it informative ’ by explaining the process , he says			0
‘ it is a " just - off - @entity139 show " with a cast of thousands , ever - changing story lines ... real drama , as well as occasional comic relief , ’ said @entity134 , who oversees the @entity136 's defense work there			0
but if it can be entertaining to watch , it 's fraught and serious work , acting state supreme court justice @entity142 , the @entity143 's supervising judge from 2008 through 2012 says			2
‘ from the judge 's perspective and all of the attorneys ' who work so hard , there 's nothing amusing about it , ’ she said			0
‘ and the stakes are very high			0
’ some court tourists are legal workers or law students seeking to educate themselves about @entity14 's justice system , or parents or who want to teach their children about it			1
@entity156 and his wife took their 16 - year - old son there last month while visiting from the @entity161 area , hoping it would be a lesson in choices and consequences			0
‘ he saw that people got themselves in trouble and that there was n't anything they could do about it until a judge made a decision , ’ @entity156 said			0
after two hours in @entity10 night court , @entity83 came away determined to observe a court back in @entity85			2
