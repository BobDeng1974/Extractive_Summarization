by @entity0 published : 04:15 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 17:24 est , 5 october 2013 @entity3 is drawing up plans for a radical @entity5 off - roader , its bosses have revealed			1
the ultimate luxury @entity8 car firm is planning to break with more than a century of tradition by allowing the legendary @entity11 ' mascot to adorn a ‘ @entity13 tractor ’			0
the biggest hint yet that the firm renowned for the ‘ waftability ’ and engineering excellence of its limousines is to press ahead with a sports utility vehicle ( @entity19 ) was dropped by @entity3 chief executive chief executive officer @entity21 - @entity20 in an interview with leading motoring magazine @entity23			1
glimpse to the future : this is how a planned @entity5 vehicle by @entity3 , the car company 's first , could look when asked directly if a @entity5 was to go ahead , he replied : ’ i have not ruled it out			1
’ and teasingly , when asked if a gambler might bet on the project getting the green light , he replied : ’ make that bet			2
’ it is understood detailed design plans have been drawn up and are being studied by top executives in @entity8 and at the @entity40 headquarters of the firm ’s @entity42 parent company @entity41			1
they accept the controversial idea may divide opinion but are aware that luxury rivals such as @entity48 and others including @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 are preparing their own @entity53 which are expected to be a huge hit in lucrative markets such as @entity56 and the @entity57			0
@entity3 said has previously described talk of a @entity5 as ' speculation ' but has not denied reports that detailed plans have been drawn up			1
@entity23 has created its own exclusive images showing how such a vehicle could look based on the ‘ design language ’ of existing models such as the @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
still stylish : bosses say the new off - roader would retain all the features of a classic @entity3 , as this picture shows			1
the new model could be on the road by 2017 mr @entity75 told @entity23 : ‘ there ’s growth in the suv sector and such a vehicle is thinkable			1
i ’m open to that			0
our design director @entity81 is already doing the first sketches			0
‘ but i can tell you that it will not look like a hummer ’ , he said referring to the massive gas - guzzling military - derived @entity85 off - roader			0
separately , bosses insist privately that the main challenge is to produce a car which rides and handles like a @entity3 and does not sacrifice quality			1
@entity3 , whose boutique factory is based at @entity96 in @entity97 in the grounds of the @entity100 's estate , has most recently launched a new sporty £ 235,0000 two - door ‘ sportback ’ coupe called the @entity67 powered by a 6.7 litre engine			1
a cabriolet version is set to follow			0
it already builds four versions of its range - topping @entity106 and two versions of its smaller @entity66			0
but now executives are planning the next chapter of the range from 2017 and beyond with an suv on the drawing board			0
@entity23 said @entity3 design chief mr @entity81 has been shuttling frequently between the firm ’s @entity96 home and @entity41 headquarters in @entity40 : ’ it is understood the main purpose of @entity81 ’s frequent visits is to present a variety of suv designs to @entity41 ’s top brass			2
’ it noted : ’ it ’s a project that ’s been rumoured for years and denied several times			1
but the top man at @entity3 has given the clearest indication yet that we will see an suv from the brand			2
and our amazing images show how this amazing model could look			0
’ it notes : ‘ they show how @entity133 ’ latest design language - as seen in the @entity66 and the @entity67 - could translate into a higher - riding suv			0
sleek : @entity3 recently unveiled its latest model , the @entity67 , which is worth more than £ 200,000 ‘ the traditional chrome grille sits proud at the front , topped off by the signature spirit of @entity139			2
meanwhile the graceful lines and rear - hinged doors both provide plenty of @entity3 class			1
’ with a price of around £ 250,000 , it says power will most likely be provided by the @entity147 which give acceleration from rest to 62mph in around 4.5 seconds			0
top speed is likely to be electronically limited to 155mph			0
@entity23 said @entity3 was keen to target ‘ an increasingly important fresher , younger breed of super-rich buyers from high - profile sports , music and film stars to dot com millionaires			1
’ it said : ’ despite their wealth , many are in their thirties or even twenties , could well be @entity56 and have a desire to own a @entity163 – but not necessarily a ‘ traditional ’ limousine			0
’ in february @entity41 board member and @entity3 chairman @entity165 was asked by @entity167 about the prospect of a 4x $ and replied : ‘ we ’re monitoring the competition ’s activities , and we ’re regularly debating whether to take action			2
this applies to all brand - relevant segments and technologies			0
’ he added : ' the @entity41 is confidently investing into the long - term future of @entity3			1
’ @entity177 broke the @entity179 mould when it launched its @entity181 sports utility vehicle			0
and @entity48 – owned by @entity42 ’s giant @entity182 - is currently giving a facelift to a prototype super-luxury @entity48 off - roader which it announced recently will be built in @entity8 at its factory in @entity188			0
@entity3 was founded after sales and marketing genius the @entity191 @entity133 met legendary engineer @entity192 at the @entity193 in @entity194 on may 4 , 1904 with the aim of creating the world 's finest motor car			2
@entity42 car giant @entity41 bought @entity3 from @entity198 in 1998 following a bidding war with rivals @entity182 which secured @entity48 - with the first @entity41 - produced @entity106 launched in 2003			1
@entity3 says the new @entity67 ‘ sportback ’ , reviving an ethereal spirit name first used in 1938 , is ' the most dynamic and powerful @entity3 in history			2

detailed plans have been drawn up based on existing rr models
vehicle would ' drive just like a @entity3 ' - and would *n't* look like a @entity208
project has been rumoured for years - and now could become reality after 2017
