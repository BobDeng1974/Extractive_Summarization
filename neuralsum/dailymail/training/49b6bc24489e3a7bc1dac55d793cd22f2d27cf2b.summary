@entity0 has all the appearance of a grown - up : greying hair , deep and commanding voice , successful job			1
but there 's more than a little bit of the child in the 52 - year - old comedian and star of @entity11			2
' i love rolling down hills , ' he confesses			2
' i do it whenever i can - though preferably not when people are watching			2
there 's a bank in my garden on the @entity20 that 's very good for rolling down			2
' @entity0 has launched a @entity22 campaign to get 200,000 kids playing outside this summer we 're talking about the great outdoors because @entity0 has just been unveiled as the new face of the @entity22 's campaign to get children to enjoy the countryside more - and he 's on a roll , as it were			1
' there 's another game i like to play where i pretend to be a stuntman			1
it 's best if you 're on a sand dune			1
you run along a sand dune , then pretend you 've been hit by an arrow and tumble down the dune			2
you ca n't possibly hurt yourself - it 's great			2
' oh , and i love trees too			2
we shot a film for the campaign the other day and i had to hide in a hollow tree			1
i could have stayed there for ages but the crew made me come out			2
i know i 'm much happier outdoors than in			1
i like nothing more than standing on a hill in the middle of a gale			2
' the campaign , called 50 things to do before you 're 11¾ , aims to get children playing outside after research suggested the time they spend outdoors has halved in a generation			1
some 50 per cent of today 's children spend less than an hour outside each day , compared to their parents ' childhood average of 2½ hours			1
among the activities on the list are flying kites , climbing trees and hunting for bugs , and the @entity22 is organising 1,000 events at its venues over the summer to get children connecting with nature			1
unlike many proponents of the campaign , @entity0 , who has a son @entity80 , 17 , and daughter @entity81 , 15 , with his garden designer second wife @entity82 , is no zealot			1
@entity0 says he is far more fun than his on screen character @entity86 in outnumbered ever reasonable , as you might expect from the man who played modern dad @entity11 to perfection in @entity11 , he 's realistic about the temptations of computer games that keep children indoors			1
' the danger is you can get very negative about technology , but i wish i 'd had an @entity96 when i was a kid			2
you do n't want your children to be on their computers all the time just because you ca n't be bothered to take them somewhere interesting			1
they learn things by seeing what 's out there			1
i 've always tried to get my kids to enjoy nature , but i do n't think i 've been any more successful than anyone else			2
' @entity0 had an idyllic if eccentric childhood growing up in east @entity107 , the son of a vicar ( later a bishop ) and a teacher			1
although he was desperate for a dog , his parents bought a cat instead - but he insisted on pretending it was a dog and even took it for walks using a washing line as a lead			2
he remembers , more than anything , the freedom he had as a child			2
' i was getting the bus to school from the age of five with my brother , who 's two years older than me , ' he recalls			2
' i never had to tell my parents what time i was going to be home			2
i loved having time to wander about and nobody would worry			0
' our home was a big , dilapidated @entity133 house			0
at the end of the garden was a bombsite and i remember digging for snails ... actually i have great trouble resisting that kind of thing now			0
my parents were always very reasonable			0
@entity0 first found fame with the @entity143 comedy , @entity144 ' when i was growing up there were discussions about whether certain things were good or bad , but i do n't remember being told off			1
that 's why i 'm such a reasonable person			0
i try to be like my parents and i have these great waves of guilt when i do n't quite manage it			0
it 's very difficult , bringing up children			1
' he says he tries to be a different sort of dad from the ultimately self - defeating @entity86 in @entity11			0
' i 'd like to think i command a lot more respect than @entity86 , ' he laughs			0
' but i 'm not sure that 's true			0
whenever i watch outnumbered i do think @entity86 often behaves in exactly the opposite way to how i would			0
' unusually - perhaps uniquely - for a celebrity , @entity0 has no stories of angst , bullying or depression			1
the one regret in his life is that he was n't able to make his first marriage - to childhood sweetheart @entity168 - work , but then he 's never been happier than he is with @entity82 and their children			1
he never harboured dreams of fame and fortune ; although naturally witty , he only ever saw comedy as a hobby until it started taking over his life			0
educated at the private @entity177 in @entity107 and then @entity178 , where he read geography , he only joined the @entity181 drama club because it seemed like the thing to do			0
' i 'd only ever appeared in one play before and when i joined the @entity181 it was never with the idea of making a career out of it , ' he recalls			1
when he left @entity178 with a @entity189 tried to recruit him , but he turned them down because he ' did n't want to do people over '			0
instead he worked in @entity193 's marketing department and carried on with the comedy with writing partner @entity195 , yet still saw it as a sideline when the pair started appearing on @entity201 's @entity200 comedy shows			0
' but then @entity195 and i were offered the @entity202 and i knew i would n't be able to combine it with work , ' he says			0
' so i said to my boss , " i do n't know what to do			0
i 've been offered this show on @entity208 and you 're about to send me to @entity210			1
" he said , " what do mean you do n't know what to do ? just go and do that			0
" they gave me a sabbatical so i could see how it worked out , but i never went back			0
' my career was never a deliberate , terribly focused thing , i 've just been tremendously lucky			0
i 'm doing something i love and i 'm lucky that my hobby - though i hate that word because it sounds like i 'm doing miniature ship building - became my job			0
' @entity0 regularly appears on the panel of @entity226 @entity227 came slowly , first with @entity200 comedy @entity144 , then with @entity226 and outnumbered			1
the last series of @entity11 finished earlier this year , though the hope is there 'll be more stand - alone episodes			0
' we 're still all in touch and we 're told there 'll be specials , ' he says			1
' i do n't think it ended because the kids are grown up and the stories are n't there			0
it 's more because they 're appearing in their own things			1
trying to get everyone together is like trying to organise a family holiday when your children have left home			1
' he laughs about the fact that his fame has reached around the world			0
' a man recently stopped me and said , " sir , you are a very big star in @entity256 , " as @entity144 is still being shown in his country			0
i still ca n't fathom it , ' he shrugs			0
' but i 'm pleased people know my name rather than asking , " you 're , erm , erm , what 's your name again ? " like they used to			1
' he says he regularly gets asked for his autograph in the street now - something that causes great embarrassment to his children			1
' oh , i embarrass them all the time , ' he guffaws			0
' sometimes i 'll find myself dancing in the kitchen and then i see them standing there with this very stern " what are you doing ? " look on their faces			0
they never take you in a corner and say , " we 'd prefer it if you did n't do that			0
" they just say , " @entity287 , do n't ever do that again			0
" but if you ca n't embarrass your children , what 's the point of having them ? ' and then off this lovely , unassuming man skips - presumably looking for a hill to roll down			1
