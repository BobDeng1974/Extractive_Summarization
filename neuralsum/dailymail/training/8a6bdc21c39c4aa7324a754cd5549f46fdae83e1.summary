@entity1 midfielder @entity0 is the subject of a £ 4million bid from @entity4 in @entity5			1
the club is managed by former @entity8 defender @entity7 who has also tried to sign @entity9 from @entity10			1
@entity1 paid £ 5.5million for @entity0 two seasons ago and may struggle to get that money back but he is 29 now and that may be the best offer they get			1
the @entity16 held talks in the @entity18 last week and is eager to sign up with other members of @entity1 's @entity21 contingent also being targeted by @entity5 clubs			1
sensing the upheaval , chairman @entity39 is not letting @entity33 or @entity41 leave cheaply			1
@entity42 have been put off paying over £ 20m for @entity33 and are weighing up other options			1
similarly they believe left - back @entity41 is over-priced but £ 10m may represent a good investment eventually for the promising 21 - year - old			1
if they do n't pay they know that @entity50 may do as they like both players and are continuing to barter			2
@entity42 will discuss a deal for @entity55 's @entity54 again but it will be separate from the deal they strike for striker @entity58 with the @entity21 side keen to loan the 26 - year - old			1
@entity1 have held talks with @entity62 about 24 - year - old @entity64 international midfielder @entity63			1
the move could see former @entity67 and @entity69 midfielder @entity68 move to @entity70 to replace @entity63			0
how much ? @entity42 believe that @entity1 full - back @entity41 is over-priced at £ 10million @entity72 are looking into an improved contract for defensive linchpin @entity74 following his impressive @entity76			1
@entity77 have already emerged as one of the clubs keen to tempt the 29 - year - old @entity80 away from @entity81 as the @entity82 look to replace @entity8 and @entity85 target @entity83 who is continuing to agitate for a move			2
@entity72 are also aware @entity88 's contract is running down			1
however , so far , they have been unable to agree terms			2
@entity90 are among clubs keeping a keen eye on negotiations			2
@entity72 have held talks with @entity1 over a deal for @entity97 midfielder @entity96 but full - back @entity98 is likely to leave with @entity100 keen to take him while @entity102 has completed his move on loan to @entity106 side @entity105			1
@entity96 , who had a loan spell at @entity108 last season , would prove a cheaper and younger option than @entity111 who @entity72 have also discussed as have @entity90			1
show me the money ! @entity72 want to tie @entity80 defender @entity74 down after an impressive @entity115 the soap opera that is @entity117 produces new plots every day			1
the club have sent @entity121 international defender @entity120 back to his club @entity123 just days after agreeing a loan			2
the 25 - year - old joined up with his new teammates at the pre-season training camp in @entity82 last week			0
however , @entity117 have pulled out of the deal after he spent just a few days training with the club			2
colourful club owner @entity130 pinpointed @entity120 's attitude saying it was not right for @entity117			2
@entity130 said : ' we want special players at @entity117			0
@entity120 did n’t show enough during the three days he trained with the rest of the team			0
' after speaking to him , it is clear that he did n’t have the right attitude to join @entity117 , so we have allowed him to leave			0
' gone ! @entity117 ' @entity130 ( left ) sent @entity120 back to his club @entity123 just days after signing a loan @entity117 have more problems on the horizon with agents of some of their first team squad contemplating serving winding up orders over outstanding wages that are owed			2
meanwhile , @entity149 are continuing to show interest in @entity117 striker @entity151			2
@entity117 were forced into a game between two sets of their own players on sunday after @entity157 side @entity155 failed to turn up for a scheduled friendly			0
new signings @entity158 and @entity160 both featured in a contest staged over three 20 - minute periods			0
the match finished 3 - 1 with @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 on target for the winning line - up and @entity151 finding the net for the beaten team			0
@entity117 signed @entity172 forward @entity171 on loan over the weekend but did not involve him in their practice game			0
@entity175 are keen on a move for @entity178 midfielder @entity177			1
the @entity180 international would like to move back to the @entity181 following @entity178 's relegation and could cost around £ 8million			0
@entity184 manager @entity183 is also keen as he contemplates the sale of @entity186 with @entity50 interested in the @entity172			0
@entity175 should agree a revised deal with @entity188 today but look like missing out to @entity189 on @entity190 of @entity191			1

the winger is joining up with @entity8 's first team squad again after a loan spell at @entity203 but he is likely to be made available for loan once the @entity181 come around			1
@entity196 are eager to build up their squad with @entity206 going to @entity184 , @entity207 discussing a move to @entity209 while @entity210 are keen on @entity211 and @entity212 and @entity213 have spoken about @entity214			2
