@entity2 v @entity0 will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century			1
evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political , social and cultural undertones , the scale of expectation and outside influences			2
where @entity14 v @entity0 comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the @entity19			1
in this , the fifth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history , i look back on one of the greatest sporting events of all time			1
the @entity29 @entity32 v @entity30 the thrilla in @entity34 @entity35 , @entity36 october 1 , 1975 just as they are saying about @entity2 v @entity0 , the perceived wisdom was that @entity39 was coming five years too late for two great boxers in their 30s			1
let us hope they are so spectacularly wrong again			1
that star - spangled night in @entity45 when @entity30 knocked down and defeated @entity46 had been followed in 1974 by a tamer , scrappier , points victory for @entity32			1
a poster for @entity32 v @entity30 , also known as the @entity33 in @entity34 , in @entity35 , @entity36 @entity32 ( right ) swings for @entity30 , who eventually lost in the 14th round to a technical knockout and so to the trilogy , a year later			1
both men had come through battles with @entity55 , @entity30 losing and @entity32 famously winning @entity57 in @entity58			1
@entity60 @entity59 october 30 , 1974 , @entity61 , @entity58 @entity30 v @entity59 march 8 , 1971 , @entity62 , @entity45 @entity65 v @entity63 july 4 , 1910 , @entity66 , @entity67 @entity69 v @entity68 june 22 , 1938 , @entity70 , @entity45 this time @entity71 had @entity34 in mind as the next heavyweight stop for his globe - trotting circus			1
@entity36 president @entity75 , like @entity58 's president @entity76 before him , saw sponsorship of the fight as a distraction from the poverty and social unrest in his country			0
it was @entity32 who became most distracted during the build - up			2
when invited to a photo - opportunity with @entity75 and his infamously big - spending wife @entity87 , he took his mistress @entity88 along and introduced her as his wife			0
mrs @entity90 watched that happen on @entity93 television and immediately flew to @entity34 to confront her husband , loudly , in his hotel suite			2
@entity32 returned to his customary psychological baiting of his opponents			2
he had insulted @entity30 before their first fight and did so again chanting : ' it will be @entity101 and a @entity33 and a @entity102 when i get @entity103 in @entity34			1
' thus the title for the fight , @entity104 in @entity34 , was coined			0
@entity32 pictured alongside his infamously big - spending wife mrs @entity90 in september 1975 @entity30 , the quiet man , was plotting a strategy of breaking down @entity32 with shots to the stomach , ribs , kidneys and liver , quoting the old ring maxim : ' if you kill the body , the head will die			1
' @entity32 would target the @entity30 head and won the early rounds while his legs were at their freshest			2
but it was impossible for him to keep dancing in the pressure - cooker heat , with the ring temperature reaching 120 degrees @entity126			0
as @entity32 started slowing , @entity30 began smokin '			2
they would engage in one of the most brutal spectacles in the annals of the hardest game			0
@entity32 was forced to lower his guard as they landed more than 100 blows to the head between them , each of such force that any one of them would have stopped lesser fighters			0
@entity32 supplemented those power shots with his quick jabs and combinations and thereby inflicted more of the facial swelling			0
boxing greats @entity30 and @entity32 pictured in the ring on october 1 , 1975 , for the @entity33 in @entity34 @entity32 and @entity30 engaged in one of the most brutal spectacles in the annals of the hardest game @entity30 's eyes began closing in the ninth			1
by the time he came out for the 13th he could barely see and @entity32 sent his gum - shield flying with the second of two massive right hooks			0
exhausted though he was , @entity32 went for the @entity153 in the 14th			0
although the monstrous barrage which sent @entity30 reeling and staggering could not put him down , it was enough to bring a sensational end to an epic battle			0
@entity32 ordered his corner - man @entity32 to cut off his gloves , saying he could not go on			0
but before he could do so @entity30 's trainer @entity159 called a halt			2
a relieved @entity32 famously said : ' this is the closest to death i have ever been			0
' @entity30 begged to be allowed to see out the 15th and final round but @entity159 told him : ' it 's over			2
no - one will ever forget what you did here today			0
' @entity30 never forgave him			0
nor @entity32 for the trilogy of insults			0
@entity32 defied the rigours of @entity172 's to attend @entity30 's funeral			1
@entity32 lifts his arms in the air after defeating @entity30 in the 14th round , but later attended his great opponent 's funeral when he died at the age of 67			1

@entity2 v @entity0 is now just eight days away
@entity184 's @entity183 has been counting down the greatest fights
in the fifth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history , we have @entity32 v @entity30 , the @entity33 in @entity34
it was said to have come five years late , much like @entity2 v @entity0
yet those *doubting* the two greats in their 30s were spectacularly wrong
