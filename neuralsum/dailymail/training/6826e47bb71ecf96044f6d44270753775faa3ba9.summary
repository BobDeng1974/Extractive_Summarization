@entity0 and @entity1 already want to be in your pocket and on your wrist , and for their next battle the rivals are gunning for your car 's dashboard			1
2015 will be the year @entity9 and @entity1 's @entity11 systems roll out to more cars and reach the mainstream			1
but concerns have already been raised about how dangerous the software is for drivers and how much the tech giants will be able to track owners			1
at that point it was known as ' @entity11 ' but following changes in the design team the system was unveiled at last year 's @entity29 , under the moniker @entity11 ( @entity31 on @entity11 pictured ) @entity0 's fighter : @entity0 used its annual developer @entity34 in june to unveil @entity9 auto , a key feature of its latest operating system @entity37			1
@entity9 works with any @entity9 phone to show a user 's information on the dashboard ( @entity42 on @entity9 pictured ) @entity1 first toyed with an in - car system at its @entity23 in june 2013			1
at that point it was known as ' @entity11 ' but following changes in the design team the system was officially unveiled at last year 's @entity29 , under the moniker @entity11			0
@entity0 used its own annual developer @entity34 in june to unveil @entity9 auto , a key feature of its latest operating system @entity37			1
@entity9 works with any @entity9 @entity52 phone to show information on the dashboard			0
in april , @entity56 researchers found that using voice to send text messages while driving - on software such as @entity1 's @entity60 - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers			1
they found both methods impacted driver response times equally - but it often took voice recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages			0
while a separate study from the @entity69 in the @entity70 , discovered that hands - free kits increase mental workload and distractions , causing reaction times to get slower and brain function to become compromised			0
this results in drivers scanning the road less and potentially not seeing items right in front of them , including pedestrians			0
rather than running its own operating system , the unit acts an external display for connected devices			0
the software automatically starts when a user plugs in their phone , and @entity0 has subsequently demonstrated how maps , @entity94 cards and music will appear on the car 's built - in screen through a series of promotional videos and trailers			1
@entity9 uses voice control for navigation , using @entity42 , and can read and reply to messages			2
music is accessed through @entity106 or the phone 's music library			0
certain models of car will have a voice - activation button on the wheel , while others will respond automatically to ' ok @entity0			2
' at the launch , @entity0 's @entity114 said the firm will allow developers to build cars apps for audio and messaging applications and has signed up more than 28 car makers			1
these include @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			1
the first wave of @entity152 cars are ' coming soon ' , but they are expected to launch this year			0
@entity1 's integrated @entity11 system works in an almost identical way			1
plugging an iphone into the car starts the system			0
it works with the @entity160 up to the @entity156 6 plus running @entity161 and above , and features @entity162 - a voice - activated , hands - free way to use the system with @entity1 's @entity60 software			1
once connected , @entity60 can be used to access the phone ’s contacts , make calls , return missed calls and listen to voicemails			2
navigation uses @entity31 , and music can be played through apps including @entity1 's own @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			1
both systems work with connected handsets and let drivers control maps , make calls ( @entity11 pictured ) , open and respond to texts and play music using voice commands			1
in @entity187 this is called @entity162			0
@entity11 is compatible with the @entity160 and above while @entity9 auto works with @entity37 @entity9 uses voice control for navigation , using @entity42 , and can read and reply to messages			1
music will be accessed through @entity106 ( pictured ) or the phone 's music library many car manufacturers will also include touchscreen controls , plus physical knobs and controls in their vehicles			0
the first car to be sold with a fully - functioning version of @entity11 was @entity204 's @entity203 unveiled in september			2
earlier this month @entity133 confirmed its @entity205 will have the features by the end of march			0
other partners include @entity122 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity209 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity210 including its @entity212 branch , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity132 , @entity211 , @entity211 , @entity136 , @entity211 , @entity138 , @entity211 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity213 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity214 , @entity148 and @entity149			0
certain models of car ( @entity136 example pictured ) will have a voice - activation button on the wheel , while others will respond automatically to spoken commands such as ' ok @entity0 ' and by 2016 all new @entity131 models are expected to have either @entity9 auto or @entity11 built - in			1
but despite the promises from both firms in terms of adding easy - to - use , hands - free features , a recent study from @entity225 found the technology may be as dangerous as texting			0
the first car to be sold with a fully - functioning version of @entity11 was @entity204 's @entity203 ( pictured ) unveiled in september			2
earlier this month @entity133 confirmed its @entity205 will have the features by the end of march other @entity11 and @entity9 auto partners include @entity122 , @entity125 , @entity209 , @entity139 , @entity148 and @entity149 ( @entity234 on a @entity149 car pictured )			1
by 2016 , all @entity131 are expected to have either @entity9 or @entity11 built - in while a separate study from the @entity69 in the @entity70 , discovered that hands - free kits increase mental workload and distractions , causing reaction times to get slower and brain function to become compromised			2
@entity11 works with the @entity160 up to the @entity156 6 plus running @entity161 and @entity243 ( pictured ) this results in drivers scanning the road less and potentially not seeing items right in front of them , including pedestrians			1
@entity1 has not commented on the findings , but during a demonstration of @entity0 's technology @entity253 , the lead project manager of @entity9 , told the @entity255 that no action on the system should take more than two seconds			1
this was designed to comply with the @entity260 ’s voluntary guidelines			0
for example , there is no @entity263 or @entity265 button , and the font on @entity42 is larger and less detailed to be less distracting			0
video streaming is blocked , as is most social media , and texts will only be sent using voice commands			2
and with the latest rumours about @entity1 's electric , self - driving car project @entity274 , both dashboard systems could be just the next step towards vehicles running solely on @entity9 or @entity161			1
@entity9 will also take advantage of @entity94 ( example pictured )			0
@entity0 now scans calendar entries to work out where a user is , or should be			0
it combines this with location data from the phone 's gps , as well as posts on social networks and email			0
it then shows cards designed to offer support it thinks the user needs @entity1 said many cars will also include touchscreen controls , plus physical knobs and controls to make controlling @entity11 as easy as possible without distracting the driver			2
a recent study from @entity225 found the technology may be as dangerous as texting reports claim @entity1 has several hundred employees developing its own electric car at a secret lab. speculation was rife earlier this month when an @entity1 - owned car was spotted driving around @entity303 fitted with @entity305 - style cameras			2
further cars were spotted in @entity307 and @entity308			0
if @entity1 was developing such technology , it would would rival @entity0 's self - driving cars			1
@entity0 's head of self - driving cars recently said he expects people to be using them on public roads in two to five years			0
@entity316 added the cars would still be test vehicles , and @entity0 would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians			0
following the latest rumours about @entity1 's electric self - driving car project @entity274 , both systems could be just the next step towards vehicles running solely on @entity9 or @entity161			1

@entity0 's head of self - driving cars @entity316 recently said he expects people to be using them on public roads in two to five years and @entity0 would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians similarly , @entity1 is said to be working on a release date of 2020 for its own range of vehicles			2
other concerns around @entity9 , @entity11 and both firms entering the car market involve privacy and tracking			2
following users on their phones , into their cars as well as their homes , campaigners are worried the tech giants will have access to a wealth of personal information			2
but mr @entity253 responded : ' it ’s exactly the same as having it in your pocket in your phone because it is on your phone			0
so the same privacy controls that we have already for @entity94 and for other third - party applications exist for this as well			0

2015 will see @entity9 and @entity1 's @entity11 rolling out to more cars
both firms have developed dashboard technology that sync with phones
devices running @entity37 and @entity161 can plug into the systems
systems then allow drivers to control maps , make calls , open and respond to texts and play music from their handsets using voice commands
@entity204 and @entity133 are first cars signed up to run full versions of @entity11
@entity0 has teamed up with 28 manufacturers including @entity125 and @entity126
but concerns have already been raised about how dangerous the software is for drivers and how much the tech giants will be able to track owners
