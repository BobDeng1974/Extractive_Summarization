by @entity0 he 's called @entity2 ugly , @entity4 fat and @entity5 fake , and now @entity6 has unleashed his acid tongue on pretty much anyone who has had cosmetic surgery in attempt to conceal the aging process			2
' the worst are the lip operations , ' he rants to @entity13			0
' they look like they flew through the windscreen during a car accident and were patched up badly afterwards			0
' the 88 - year - old fashion designer - who is perhaps as famous for his cutting remarks as he is for his work at the helm of @entity22 - added that he knows people he does n't even ' recognize ' after they 've undergone lip surgery			1
outspoken : eighty - eight - year - old @entity22 designer @entity6 ( pictured last week in @entity25 ) has slammed those who go under the knife in order to look younger ' nothing makes you look older than attempting to look young , ' he continues			1
and mr @entity6 's contempt for the ' old ' appears to extend much further than just those who try to cheat the clock by going under the knife			1
' i do n't know anyone from my generation			0
i find those people terrible ' , he admits , favoring the company of much younger people instead			2
car crash ? mr @entity6 took particular issue with lip surgery , likening people who have had it ( such as @entity46 , 74 , pictured ) with victims of car accidents who have ' flown through the windscreen ' fans : other notable sporters of the trout pout include @entity53 ( right ) and actress @entity54 ( left ) who was once regularly seen on the arm of mr @entity6 , but before she allegedly started having lip injections and he is true to his word when it comes to hanging out with a younger crowd			1
the formidable fashion king regularly makes appearances in the selfies of the young @entity64 - elite , most recently posing at a @entity66 store launch party with 21 - year - old model - of - the - moment @entity67 and singer @entity69 , 29			0
he 's also a fan of 24 - year - old actress @entity70 , who stars in his latest campaign for @entity22 , and was once regularly spotted in the company of @entity54 - although that was before she started sporting her famous ' trout pout ' , and we know now how he feels about that			2
but even his favorite supermodel , miss @entity67 , has n't escaped mr @entity6 's sharp tongue of late			1
speaking to @entity79 last month , he revealed that he did not consider the bushy - browed @entity80 to be ' a standout beauty ' - but rather a model with ' strange ' proportions			0
younger crowd : the formidable designer also says he prefers the company of younger friends ( pictured with @entity67 and @entity69 last week ) over his own ' terrible ' generation @entity89 tongued : despite miss @entity67 being a firm favorite of mr @entity6 ( pictured together closing @entity22 's @entity91 ) he recently said he does n't consider the model to be ' a standout beauty ' he also spoke frankly of his views on tattoos , beloved by his many youthful friends worldwide , saying : ' tattoos are like sleeping in a printed t - shirt , you will never get clean again			1
' mr @entity6 , who has enjoyed a 67 year career in the fashion industry , concludes his interview with @entity13 by offering a little insight as to the very beginnings of his age - related preferences			1
' as a child i only had one wish : to be grown up , ' he remarks			0
' i did n't play with other children , i thought they were dreadful			0
the only thing i did was read , learn languages and sketch			0

the @entity22 designer has a particular disdain for lip surgery
mr @entity6 , 88 , admits his own generation is ' terrible ' and prefers a younger crowd
also reveals he never played with other ' dreadful ' kids as a little *boy*
