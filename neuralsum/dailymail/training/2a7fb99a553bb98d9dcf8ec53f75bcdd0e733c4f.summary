@entity4 captain @entity62 rises unmarked to head the hosts into the lead			1
@entity65 has been a fine addition to the @entity4 midfield since coming on and he plays through @entity60 who is hauled down on the run we 're set for a pulsating final 10 minutes as both sides seem determined to find a winner ... @entity73 replaces @entity74 , who has had a decent outing for the @entity6 , linking up well with @entity39 in the @entity2 attack			1

click here to read more that 's the half - time break at the @entity165			0
it 's been tense and well fought but very few clear chances to rave about the referee is perhaps a bit trigger happy with the cards as @entity60 enters the book			0

his crisp strike goes wide but narrowly misses the @entity4 woodwork			0
well as soon as i speak there is a chance			0
@entity74 capitalises on a poor @entity4 clearance to take fire from the edge of the box but his effort is comfortably saved by @entity19			1
the reason why you have n't heard much in terms of chances is due to the lack of width in the game			0
both sides are determined to play down the middle but have thus far failed to find the intricate pass			0
@entity20 is on the deck again and it 's nasty			0
@entity2 skipper @entity205 is lucky not to pick up a second booking after his lunge on @entity20 lands right on the winger 's ankle			1
that must have hurt ! well it 's been a quiet night so far for @entity19 in the @entity4 goal but a couple of clearances have kept the 33 - year - old on his toes @entity39 is impressing with his link up play for the @entity6 but the majority of the play is in the middle of the park as both sides are struggling for momentum and penetration going forward @entity205 is the first in the book after the @entity6 captain takes down @entity20			1
the @entity4 winger is getting numerous hard hits from the @entity2 youngsters but this one was deemed a step too far			2
@entity234 then quickly follows into the book for a late challenge for @entity4			2
after quarter of an hour it 's @entity2 who are dominating possession and managing to stretch the @entity4 defence the away side win a corner and @entity52 is presented with the game 's best chance thus far			1

@entity60 swings in a smart ball for the hosts from the right but his cross evades the @entity4 frontline			0
@entity87 leaves @entity19 in the lurch with a miss - cued back pass , which the @entity262 ca n't prevent going for an early corner			1
