investigation : town councillor @entity1 is being investigated over claims that he called a motorist a ' smelly cow ' a politician once dubbed the real - life @entity6 because he complained to councils so often is now being investigated himself over claims he called a motorist a ' smelly cow '			1
over the years @entity12 - a @entity14 count - cost taxpayers £ 125,000 after he spawned 1,046 letters , faxes , and e-mails to and from his local council , who in the end gave him his own officer			1
such was his dissatisfaction with local government that he stood as a candidate and was elected as a town councillor in @entity26 in @entity27			1
but he is now facing a probe himself after a female motorist claims she was verbally abused by him after she parked across the street from his home			2
the woman , who did not want to be named , said : ' i parked up where i was n't blocking anyone 's driveway on either side of the road			1
' as i got out of my car i heard shouting from the opposite side of the road			1
i realised that a gentleman standing in front of gates across the road was shouting at me to move my car , which was actually parked well forward of his gates			1
' i was absolutely shocked and appalled - amongst other expletives i was called a ' stupid cow ' and a ' smelly cow ''			1
the councillor , who is better known as @entity1 , has said : ' obviously , i regret it if i may have used inappropriate language			1
' but councillor @entity1 has disputed the motorist 's version of events			2
he said : ' i politely asked the woman to move her car forward so that we could exit our driveway without complicated manoeuvres			2
' it was she who started a shouting match and then refused to move her car			1
' row : the councillor got into a row with a woman who parked opposite his drive in this @entity27 street he added : ' i dare say that when one is confronted by rude and inconsiderate people , one may lose one 's temper and say things which are not necessarily appropriate			1
' i notice that the so - called lady failed to mention that she gave me two fingers and to distribute a story which is not accurate and to my detriment speaks for itself			1
' why could she not have moved a few feet further forward without causing an argument ? ' the woman has denied making an offensive gesture or being rude to him			2
mr @entity1 achieved national fame in 2002 for being a serial complainer			0
@entity82 had to hold a special meeting about the mountain of paperwork his letters , faxes and phone calls created for them , and calculated it cost them £ 125,000			2
but mr @entity1 said at the time : ' i eat , sleep and drink local authority laws			2
they 're my hobby '			0
then council chief executive @entity95 said of his reputation : ' to compare this man to @entity6 would be wrong			0
some people sympathise with mr @entity6 '			0
probe : @entity99 , pictured , says they are ' obliged ' to investigate and will warn him about his future conduct the local authority even set aside an officer to deal with his correspondence , to which mr @entity1 said at the time : ' i 'm told i can only deal with an administration officer			0
it 's an insult and i 've written to complain			0
' @entity99 , which he is now a member of , estimated his complaints and queries to them had cost them £ 7,000			0
today its chairman said his behaviour in the parking row had been ' unacceptable '			0
chairman @entity116 said : ' we have to investigate it			0
he has admitted he used inappropriate language and that was unacceptable for a councillor '			1
on his reputation for complaining she said : ' @entity1 is an articulate and intelligent man but he does get frustrated by bureaucracy '			0
mrs @entity116 added that she would be writing to him and warning him about his future behaviour			0
the incident was reported to @entity128 , although the force said it was not taking any action .			0
