@entity0 : the life by @entity2 @entity0 has been a genuine global star for half a century			1
how many other people can say that ? by my reckoning , it ’s no more than a handful : @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity15 @entity14			2
and only one of them , i believe , lives in a larger house than sir @entity19			2
sir @entity0 ( pictured in @entity21 in 1978 ) had his first no 1 in the @entity23 in march 1965 it was in march 1965 that his first hit , it ’s not unusual , went to no 1 in the @entity23 and made him famous			1
to this day , the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded			2
another significant milestone approaches on june 7 , when he will turn 75 years old			1
all of which makes him the perfect subject for a lavishly appointed , no - holds - barred hardback biography			2
@entity2 ’s is not the first — in fact , it ’s the twelfth			0
but it ’s the first for nearly two years , and should keep us going until the autumn , when sir @entity41 ’s autobiography is due out			1
what else will the great man be able to reveal , given that almost every imaginable revelation has already been made ? @entity41 ( pictured in early 1970s ) married his wife @entity45 in 1957 when they were both only 16 - years - old for sir @entity41 has not lived a particularly secretive life			1
though married to @entity45 , @entity48 , for 58 years , and happily so , he has enjoyed a prolific extra-curricular love life			1
but as long as @entity45 does n’t have to read about it in the newspaper — let ’s hope she does n’t read this — she turns a blind eye			1
it ’s not just a matter of having your cake and eating it			0
it ’s having more cake than anyone else has ever had and eating every last crumb of it			0
such opportunities would never have arisen , of course , without the talent			0
@entity0 was born with the gift of a golden voice , and he knows exactly what to do with it			1
this was apparent on his first hit , and has not wavered since			0
@entity0 ( pictured ) was born @entity73 but was persuaded to change his name by his manager @entity75 , who also persuaded the star to move to @entity77 from @entity78 quite what he should do with his career has not always been so obvious but , under the watchful eye of his son , @entity82 , who has managed him since the mid-eighties , he has recaptured his place in the sun and gained a new generation of fans			1
several generations , in fact			0
the backstory is well known			0
babies hear it on their mothers ’ knees , and then tell it to their own babies many years later			2
born @entity73 in @entity97 , @entity98 , the infant @entity41 ‘ had an edge , even as a youngster in short trousers			1
he did n’t just sing a song ; he performed it with verve and passion ’			0
aged 12 , he lost a year at school through tuberculosis ; at 16 , he was married with a child on the way			1
‘ most of the girls found him very attractive , ’ said one schoolmate			0
‘ he seemed a bit rough to me , but he definitely had the charisma			0
he had a way with him , a swagger			0
’ @entity0 ( right ) is pictured with his manager , @entity75 ( left ) , in january 1969			1
@entity120 worked as the superstar 's manager for 20 years until he died of cancer in 1986 the climb from obscurity , though , was long and arduous			2
@entity41 was a member of a band called the @entity127 , who were n’t going anywhere terribly fast			1
a sharp - eyed young manager , @entity75 , persuaded him to move to @entity77 , change his name to ‘ @entity0 ’ and begin a solo career			1
he was already in his mid- 20s			0
for 20 years , until @entity75 died of cancer , @entity41 always deferred to his expertise			1
in return , @entity75 did all @entity41 ’s dirty work and sacked anyone who needed sacking			1
it was an arrangement that suited them both perfectly			0
hits in the @entity142 led to @entity143 in the @entity144 , and what might best be described as the @entity146			0
no bow - tie was larger or fluffier than @entity19 , no hips swivelled more suggestively			0
@entity149 was a good friend and was convinced @entity41 wore a sock down the front of his trousers			1
@entity41 knew everyone and got on with nearly all of them , though he did n’t like it when @entity156 , with his characteristic @entity158 wit , called him a ‘ @entity78 poof ’			1
would anyone ? @entity41 ( pictured ) has been a judge on the @entity23 talent show since 2012 , as has @entity162 ( pictured ) nonetheless , an artistic nadir of some sort was reached when @entity41 recorded five consecutive country albums in the early @entity166			1
the live tours and vegas residencies had made him hedge - fund rich			0
he and @entity45 lived in splendour in @entity170 , with many close relatives comfortably ensconced round the corner			2
but was it making him happy ? well , yes , but at the same time , @entity41 clearly needed to reconnect with the bluesier , rootsier music he had first loved			2
it has n’t been an entirely easy ride since then , but his last two studio albums , @entity178 ( 2010 ) and @entity179 ( 2012 ) , have been the best of his long career			0
what comes over throughout the book is the straightforwardness of the man			0
other stars say they might consider plastic surgery one day if the need arises , when they have clearly had the lot done			0
sir @entity0 has also had the lot done — but cheerfully admits to it			2
he has a reputation for being a little slow to put his hand in his pocket , yet is generous with family and close friends , as you or i would be in his position			0
he does n’t like drugs or gambling , but enjoys a good cigar , and has drunk so much vintage champagne that at least one of his lovers was put off the stuff for good			0
sir @entity41 ( pictured ) , unlike many other celebrities , has admitted to having had plastic surgery work @entity2 is an efficient chronicler of the life , as befits an old pro whose previous books have included @entity214 , @entity215 ( @entity216 ) , @entity217 ( @entity218 ) , @entity219 , @entity220 ( @entity221 ) , @entity222 and , of course , @entity224			1
there are a few factual errors that suggest speed of composition or just lack of knowledge : @entity232 ’s song is called @entity233 , not @entity234 , for instance , and he does n’t know that @entity236 did not write the lyrics to his songs , which is a bit poor			0
but his book bounces along happily enough , forever marvelling that this faintly disgraceful old rake has been forgiven every - thing and become universally adored			2
as @entity243 put it when presenting him with yet another lifetime achievement award : ‘ @entity0 has lived the life we would all love to live			1
’ i have no doubt that women swooned and grown men wept , and sir @entity41 probably sang it ’s not unusual for about the 20,000th time .			2

@entity0 turns 75 this year and has been a global star for half a century
he has been happily married to his wife @entity45 for the past 58 years
despite this he has enjoyed a prolific extra-curricular love life
@entity149 was convinced that @entity41 wore a sock down the front of his trousers
