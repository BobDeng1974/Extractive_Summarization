' i want to keep busy , i had a big fight against @entity26 , it did not go my way , and with all of the build up and effort which went into that fight , i did not get enough out of it to justify the prep			2
' i then had 12 hard rounds against ( @entity64 ) @entity63 and wanted to be out again before @entity65 , so this is the perfect time			2
' @entity0 believes he has not stood still since his @entity29 disappointment in may , when he was knocked out in the eighth round , and holds big ambitions on both sides of the @entity71			2
' something which has been installed in me for a long time now , is just to think about yourself , not what your opponent is doing , ' said @entity0 , now fighting under the @entity77 banner			0
@entity0 returned to winning ways by defeating @entity63 in september @entity79 would be interested in a third rematch with @entity26 after twice losing tothe @entity50 and @entity51 champion ' i take that mentality from the gym into the ring			1
' it is not about taking your eye off the ball because you lost in may , or that you might be in a bigger fight next year , i just want to go out and perform , to keep the momentum going and keep the show going for the fans			0
' to do that , you have to be fully focused with a mindset and direction , that is what i have got at the moment , and i know there are massive fights out there for me			0
' @entity0 added : ' i always try to be a realist in every situation , both in and out of the ring , what my situation is , what my value is , who will be the right opponent			0
' i always want to improve as a fighter , i want to be a complete fighter , although i do n't think i or anyone ever will be			0
@entity18 ( r ) trains ahead of his main card fight with @entity19 at the @entity20 on saturday @entity19 takes part in a public sparring session at the @entity115 in @entity116 ' i want to get as close to that as humanly possible , so you have to look at your mistakes as well as what you are doing well , try to understand them and improve on them			1
' i know where i have gone wrong in the past , so i will look to improve in those areas , that is the best way to be			0
' you only get one chance , life is not a dress rehearsal , so let 's make the most of it and do it right first time			0
