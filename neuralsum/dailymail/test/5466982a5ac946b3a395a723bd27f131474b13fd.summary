a first - of - its - kind 3d simulation has revealed what happens when two supermassive black holes dramatically collide in a disk			1
the video swoops around the disc of superheated material known as a quasar surrounding the black hole , showing how it takes shape			2
and the simulation is particularly interesting , because recent observations show two such black holes are going to collide in just seven years - so the prediction can be tested in real life			1
it shows what happens when two supermassive black holes collide the simulation was led by scientists at the @entity18 and included dr @entity25 , dr @entity26 , dr @entity27 , dr @entity28 , dr @entity29 , and dr @entity30			1
to make the simulation , the researchers used @entity34 ’s general theory of relativity coupled with equations that govern how matter moves near the speed of light in a magnetic field			0
in the simulations , the processes taking place as the two black holes merge is shown			2
as they come closer , the magnetic field lines around the two become erratic , while the jets firing out from the ‘ poles ’ of each object merge into one			2
gravitational waves - ripples in space - time caused by such an event - are also predicted to be created by the merger , while electromagnetic energy is blasted into space			0
once merged , the material around the black holes continues to swirly intensely			1
known as a quasar , this is a region of superheated dust and gas that surrounds supermassive black holes			1
they are extremely bright and power the centre of galaxies			0
at the centre of our @entity69 , for example , a bright quasar surrounding the supermassive black hole is visible			2
this first simulation shows the gas and magnetic fields as the two supermassive black holes collide this second simulation shows the gravitational waves - ripples in space - time - in the merger material swirls around the objects in a quasar and jets fire out from the poles in the merger			1
it comes after two black holes were found to be seven years from merging			1
shown here are gravitational waves produced the simulation takes on added significance because , just the other day , it was revealed that two black holes 10.4 billion light years away are likely to collide in seven years			1
the discovery was made using data from the @entity97 telescope in @entity98			0
each of the black holes found inside the quasar @entity102 +01.4075 has the mass of ten billion suns , and this simulation could provide an insight into what will happen if - or when - they merge			1
‘ as a technical achievement , there ’s no doubt that this [ simulation ] is a giant step forward , ’ dr @entity108 of the @entity109 in @entity110 , who was not involved in the study , told @entity112			0
‘ this merger would be amazing , if we saw it			0
’ supermassive black holes at the centre of large galaxies could be powering blasts from deep inside the galaxy 's core , astronomers have claimed			1
astronomers have sought the driving force behind these massive molecular outflows for years , but now a team of @entity109 scientists has found an answer			2
the huge outpourings of material are responsible for ejecting enough dust and gas to build more than a thousand stars the size of our sun every year			0
and these outflows could also remove huge quantities of star - making gas , dictating the size , shape and overall fate of galaxies			0
gravitational waves - ripples in space - time caused by such an event – are also predicted to be created by the merger ( illustrated ) , while electromagnetic is blasted into space however , astronomers note that it is not a certainty the observed quasar has two colliding black holes inside it			2
the evidence so far comes from fluctuations in the quasar ’s light - but this could just be due to a single black hole and a disc , rather than an orbiting partner			0
nonetheless , astronomers will be keen to observe it in further detail in case their predictions turn out to be correct			0
and if so , it could also provide a rare opportunity to observe gravitational waves - ripples in space time that occur during such a massive event like this .			0
