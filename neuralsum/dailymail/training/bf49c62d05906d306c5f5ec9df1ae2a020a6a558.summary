organisers have been accused of discrimination after forcing wheelchair users to book tickets through an 0844 number the @entity29 website showing the need for disabled people to ring the premium rate number to book wheelchair space tickets ( right ) some disabled people now claim they have abandoned hope of attending the @entity1 after being kept on hold for long periods running up large bills before eventually being told there are no tickets available			1
hundreds have complained about their treatment on blogs and social networking sites and some have joined a campaign group on @entity47 called ' stop the @entity48 from discriminating against wheelchair users ! ' calls cost 5p a minute from a @entity52 landline and up to 40p a minute from a mobile on the @entity55 network , 35p on @entity56 and three , and 25p on @entity58			1
some networks also charge a connection fee			0
many disabled people have to call the number on a mobile because they have specially adapted phones that are easier to use than landlines			1
one woman , who has a disabled five - year - old son , said she called the ticket hotline more than 20 times on her @entity55 mobile phone and on some occasions spent up to half an hour on hold			2
such a call to the 0844 number would cost £ 12			0
wheelchair user @entity75 , 32 , from @entity76 , who has to use a specially adapted mobile phone , said she had given up trying to buy tickets after calling the hotline from her mobile six times and each time being put on hold for up to 15 minutes			1
she said : ' @entity17 have designed the system to restrict us			0
why are they advertising an 0844 ? it is discriminatory towards the disabled			0
' my able - bodied friends can go online and check availability , see when the latest seats become available and buy them with no added charges			1
wheelchair users , meanwhile , get left with only one option and that costs us extra money			1
' last night former labour sports minister @entity99 , chairman of the all - party disability sports group at @entity101 , branded the phone charges ' unacceptable ' and called on @entity17 to remove them			2
he said : ' this is completely ridiculous			0
wheelchair users should be able to book their @entity1 tickets online just like everyone else			1
' i shall be contacting @entity17 as soon as possible to ask them to remove these charges and reimburse people who have incurred unnecessary expense so far			0
the @entity111 is about breaking down barriers – not subjecting wheelchair users to charges that other people do n't have to pay			1
' disabled marathon runner @entity116 lights the @entity48 cauldron for the @entity1 wheelchair users who want to buy tickets to the @entity1 , which start on wednesday , are directed on @entity17 's website to a section called ' ticket information for disabled people '			1
this page informs them that they must call the phone line			0
the website says : ' if you require a wheelchair space , you can purchase tickets by calling the @entity29 accessibility team on 0844 847 2012			2
' at the @entity134 , tickets for people with wheelchairs were sold online and through dedicated phone lines with no additional charges			1
the disclosures are likely to prove embarrassing for @entity17 , which boasts on its website that it has ' created a ticketing process which is inclusive and accessible ' and claims ' it is important to us that people of all abilities can purchase tickets easily '			2
the group on @entity47 campaigning against the ticketing – which has 688 members – was founded by @entity150 , 33 , whose 11 - year - old son @entity151 has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair			1
she wrote an open letter to @entity17 chairman @entity155 complaining about the issue and sent her website 's link to his personal @entity160 account but says she has had no response			0
former @entity162 sports minister @entity99 branded the phone charges ' unacceptable ' and called on @entity17 to remove them she said : ' my fear was that my phone bill would end up being more than the actual tickets for the family			2
i know some people who have got through fairly quickly but others who have told me they have been waiting for more than half an hour only to be cut off			0
' it is severely depressing that disabled people are being treated as second - class citizens like this			1
' when a @entity177 reporter called the number yesterday , after getting through it took 11 minutes of talking to an operator to find out which tickets were available			2
our reporter was told the only available wheelchair tickets were for @entity184 and cost £ 15 for adults and £ 5 for concessions			2
a companion would be able to attend free			0
there were also ground passes available for the @entity191 and @entity192 centre			0
@entity193 , chief executive of disability charity scope said : ' at a time when disabled people report that attitudes towards them are deteriorating , the @entity111 offers a once in a lifetime opportunity to make a hugely positive difference			1
' despite increasing the number of wheelchair accessible seats in the @entity203 , there does n't appear to be any additional provision made for disabled people who want to buy these tickets			1
' the majority of people these days want the convenient and cost effective option of making their purchases online and disabled people are no different			1
' @entity213 , from disability charity @entity214 , said : ' it could be in breach of the @entity218			1
@entity17 should investigate how they can refund the cost of the call to all those people			2
it is unfair and unjustified to discriminate in this way			0
' and @entity224 , from @entity225 , said : ' forcing disabled people to call premium rate numbers to book tickets is simply unjustifiable			1
' last night @entity17 said it did not make any revenue from the phone line			0
it is unknown if @entity232 , who handles the ticket sales , makes anything from the calls			0
@entity17 also said it had not received any complaints about the cost of calls and that the average length of calls to the phone line was less than two minutes			2
a spokesman said : ' all spectators were able to apply for tickets online for more than a year			1
' from november 2011 , we provided a bespoke phone line to ensure customers could discuss their individual accessibility needs			0
' we really are trying our best			0
there are so many needs – soldiers and others who need legroom for their prosthetic limbs			0
we try to switch them and need to talk to them			0
we are proud to do more for spectators with accessibility needs than any other sporting event in this country			0
we offer free games mobility scooters at @entity1 venues , free blue badge parking , and a free companion seat for every wheelchair space			0
by may just under 1.5 million of the total 2.5 million @entity111 tickets were still unsold			0
by august 7 , about 1.1 million tickets remained , by august 14 about 400,000 were left and last night there were 200,000 unsold .			0
