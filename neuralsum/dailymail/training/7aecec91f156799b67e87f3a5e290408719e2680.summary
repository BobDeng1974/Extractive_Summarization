by @entity0 @entity1 : 18:58 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:40 est , 23 december 2013 police are to investigate @entity4 over her admission that she took cocaine and smoked cannabis in front of her children			1
in an extraordinary turnaround , the celebrity cook could now face the prospect of being formally interviewed by officers over her evidence			1
last week , when her former assistants @entity17 and @entity18 were acquitted of defrauding her and ex-husband @entity19 , @entity15 appeared reluctant to act			1
facing probe : @entity4 arriving at @entity21 in @entity22 where she gave evidence in the trial of two former personal assistants who worked for her and @entity19 in a statement , it said : ' at this stage the @entity29 will not be investigating these allegations			2
' but in the wake of stinging criticism , a senior commander at the @entity29 gave an interview in which he suggested police would pursue the matter with fresh vigour			1
commander @entity39 said officers would be working with prosecutors to examine the ' implications ' of what miss @entity4 and her aides said under oath			1
he promised the @entity15 would devote ' specialist resources ' to examine all the evidence in what could be a protracted review			1
dismissing the earlier statement , he said : ' frankly , i do n't think the full colour of the @entity29 's position was conveyed in that statement			2
we will use specialist resources from within the @entity29 to examine all the evidence which emerged as part of a review into this matter			1
' at some point , once that review is concluded , presumably in conjunction with the @entity63 , we will determine a way forward			2
' part and parcel of that review we will undertake will be to look at all aspects of the testimony that was given in the trial , which is now public knowledge , and will reveal itself in the transcripts of the trial			2
sisters @entity18 ( left ) and @entity78 , the two former personal assistants cleared of defrauding @entity4 and @entity19 ' there are implications in terms of what has been said during the course of that trial and all those implications will be taken into account in determining an appropriate way forward			2
' the significant development comes as a damning statement emerged yesterday from @entity89 , @entity19 's second wife , suggesting that miss @entity4 tried to involve his 18 - year - old daughter @entity90 in drug taking			2
mrs @entity89 said : ' i am furious that my daughter , @entity90 , was put into a dangerous environment with the heavy drug use of @entity4			0
' the revelations could prompt social services to intervene amid claims that miss @entity4 habitually used drugs in front of her own children aged 17 and 19 and may have involved them and step - daughter @entity90 in ' a druggy world '			0
social services may want to consider whether the allegations raise child protection issues			0
when she took the stand at @entity21 to give evidence against her two former aides , the tv cook admitted taking cocaine on six occasions with @entity113 , her first husband , when he found out he had terminal cancer			1
she also said she took the class - a drug in july 2010 when she was subjected to ' intimate terrorism ' by mr @entity19			0
miss @entity4 admitted smoking cannabis in the last year of her marriage to the multi-millionaire art gallery owner			0
however her two assistants told the court she repeatedly used the class - a drug and @entity18 said the chef ' lets the children smoke weed '			0
police will now consider whether to bring drug possession charges and could interview her under caution in a bid to identify her suppliers			1
they may also want to question @entity131 , who wrote in a national newspaper that she had taken cocaine with mr @entity113 before his death in 2001			0
yesterday a spokesman stressed there was no ' imminent prospect of a prosecution ' , but a full review of the case will take place			1
like his predecessors , @entity15 boss sir @entity142 will be particularly sensitive to any notion that police give celebrities special treatment			1
but without physical evidence of possession of the class - a drug , it may be difficult to bring any charges			0
former @entity29 commissioner sir @entity152 famously vowed to crack down on middle - class cocaine users			0
but the following year , a cocaine probe into @entity155 ended in farce			0
the supermodel was cleared despite being pictured apparently snorting ' line after line ' at a recording studio			0
a minor legal loophole meant police could not prove which type of drug was involved			1
a spokesman for @entity166 refused to comment on the @entity168 case yesterday			0
she said : ' we do not comment on the specifics of protecting children			0

tv cook could face prospect of being formally interviewed by officers
last week , @entity15 appeared reluctant to act
in the wake of stinging criticism , police suggest they will pursue the matter with fresh vigour
