@entity9 must also allow freedom of the seas , he said			0

one aide got a front - row seat to the tension between @entity15 and @entity0 in @entity20 @entity93 chief @entity92 has downplayed the strength of the @entity5 naval fleet			1

@entity5 had publicised its intent to deploy a task force to the @entity51 a while ago , and an ocean - going tug and an oiler are part of that group			0
' so it 's just one part of their operations			0
they 're in international waters			0
they 're allowed to do that			0
