2012 @entity2 runner - up @entity0 is tanned , rested and ready and will win the presidency in 2016,a @entity5 congressman claimed on monday			1
rep. @entity6 and former @entity7 gov. @entity0 are both @entity5 republicans and @entity9 – @entity6 is a jew who converted in college – but he insisted on @entity12 's ' @entity11 that his pick is guided by substance , not home - team rooting			1
' i think he actually is gon na run for president , ' he said during a segment he shared with @entity21 @entity20 rep. @entity19 , a fellow @entity22 member			1

' ' i think he ’s proven right on a lot of stuff			1
i happen to be in the camp that thinks he ’s actually going to run , and i think he will be the next @entity40			2
' @entity6 told the @entity41 on tuesday that ' there are more reasons [ for @entity0 ] to do it than not			1
' ' i have n’t yet consulted my @entity45 , but i bet it would come to the same conclusion			0
' a @entity49 poll released last week found that 45 per cent of @entity50 believe the country would be better off if @entity0 had won the presidency in 2012			1
thirty - eight per cent say a president @entity0 would have made the country worse off			2
that same poll placed president @entity55 at the top of a list of the ' worst presidents ' since @entity59 @entity29 chairman @entity60 told the @entity61 on tuesday that he wants the @entity30 to change its rules to leave the door open to drafting @entity0 into the presidential race even if he 's not a declared candidate			1
' it 's never been done before , ' @entity60 said			0
' we 're not going to stop until we have gov. @entity0 as the @entity26 nominee			2
' @entity0 has been openly critical of the president in recent months , especially concerning the growing crisis in @entity72			1
' his foreign policy is what has led to these crises all over the world and trying to recapture the lead , and keeping these kinds of things from happening is going to be a real challenge , ' he told @entity81 on june 12			0
' i do n’t know how we can go on with a country not having the kind of leadership that it needs			0
… this is the result of the president ’s missteps over the past several years			0
' stumping for @entity26 @entity91 candidate @entity90 in @entity92 last week , @entity0 insisted that he wo n't run for president a third time			1
he was also a candidate in 2008 , losing the @entity26 nomination to @entity97 sen. @entity96			0
the @entity98 reported that the @entity90 campaign held its rally at the same @entity92 location where @entity0 launched his 2012 @entity2 bid			1
@entity6 was on the @entity12 program ' hardball ' along with democrat @entity19 , who serves with him on the @entity22 @entity0 , the 2012 @entity26 presidential nominee ( 2nd @entity104 ) , accompanied @entity92 senate candidate @entity90 ( r ) during a campaign stop at a farm in @entity107 , @entity92 on july 2 former @entity92 @entity108 gov. @entity108 boomed to a cheering crowd at the event that ' we had an election in 2012 in which clearly the wrong person won			1
' @entity90 said later that ' @entity92 knows @entity0 very , very well , and not just because he won the presidential primary here			0
' after @entity0 spoke , he was ' mobbed , ' the @entity98 reported , by fans including some wearing t - shirts from his 2012 campaign			0
but he again rejected the idea of a @entity0 2016 run			2
' i 'm going to get behind the one who i think has the best chance of winning , ' he said , adding later that ' we 'll get someone who can win			0
' ' the field of the republican candidates that i ’m seeing are much better equipped ' to run , @entity0 told @entity129 last month at a @entity26 fundraising retreat in @entity131			2
' i brought a number of the 2016 contenders here , ' he said			0
' if i had been running , i would n't be doing that			0

rep. @entity6 said on @entity12 that @entity0 is ' actually going to run , and i think he will be the next president of the @entity50 '
' he ’s been proven right on a lot of stuff , said @entity6
@entity0 has *brushed* aside *questions* about his *political* future but has gone on record to *castigate* the @entity55 @entity2 for its handling of @entity72
@entity6 and @entity0 are both from @entity5 and the congressman converted from @entity147 to @entity148 – @entity0 's faith – in college
