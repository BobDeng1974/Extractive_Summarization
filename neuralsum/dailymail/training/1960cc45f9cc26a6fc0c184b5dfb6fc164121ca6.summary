by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale the appointment of crisis management agency @entity2 to help keep @entity3 in a job demonstrates how seriously the @entity5 are taking the chief executive ’s sexist emails scandal			1
@entity2 , who specialise in discreet reputational work for high - end clients , was founded by @entity11 , former @entity12 spin doctor , and ex-google executive @entity13			0
and @entity15 sports editor @entity14 is set to join			1
the choice of @entity17 also highlights the cosy governance set - up at the @entity5 , which has to be reformed even if @entity3 stays in office			2
all - powerful @entity3 ’s effective line managers are the @entity5 ’s audit and remuneration committee , who decide his bonus and salary			2
serious : the @entity5 have hired a crisis management agency to try and help @entity27 doubt : there are growing concerns whether @entity27 's friend @entity31 should be a and @entity33 chairman and that group is chaired by @entity3 ’s close friend and shooting partner @entity31 , chairman of @entity38			1
and @entity38 happen to be another client of @entity17			0
as a result , there are growing concerns as to whether @entity31 should remain chairman of the @entity45 group			0
the @entity5 strongly defend their ridiculous two - strong board of @entity3 and interim chairman @entity47 , whose @entity49 firm receive a considerable proportion of their business from the @entity5			1
the @entity5 claim the 20 clubs , who meet at least six times a year , are the directors of the company			2
but their one - eyed focus is purely on their own fortunes			0
sofa time : @entity60 will pause his @entity62 preparations to work with @entity63 for the @entity65 final @entity66 captain @entity60 will be a guest pundit with @entity63 for the @entity65 final			1
@entity60 will now be spending a fortnight in @entity68			2
he is on holiday this week , followed by training with @entity66 at @entity71 before the final in @entity73			0
@entity5 sponsors @entity74 , who have reportedly voiced upset over @entity3 ’s sexist emails , are to change pr agencies			2
it is widely expected that @entity74 will not renew their current three - year deal with the top flight , but they will hire @entity81 and instruct them to do a root - and - branch look into how much value the £ 40m - a - year @entity5 backing brings to a bank involved in a major cost - cutting exercise			1
the highly prestigious @entity89 function was relegated to a cramped basement room at @entity92 ’s @entity91 because of a switch of dates			0
the main reception suite , instead of being adorned with evocative pictures of every winner of the @entity99 award , was booked by the @entity100			0
and rather than @entity102 being honoured in the big room , it was a bbq chicken and bacon slaw wrap and a prosciutto and asparagus melt			0
@entity108 ’s priorities wrong it will not please followers of rugby league giants @entity111 that their chairman @entity112 has chosen to go to the @entity114 final rather than his club ’s @entity116 clash with @entity118 at the @entity119			1
@entity112 is also chairman of @entity121 football team @entity120 and an @entity114 councillor			1
he was one of four councillors who spoke out in favour of @entity126 owner @entity125 being allowed to change the name of the club to @entity126 which the @entity114 voted to reject			0
meanwhile , it ’s understood the astonishing decision for the @entity133 v @entity132 fixture to be staged in @entity134 at the same time as @entity126 take on @entity135 in the @entity114 final at @entity137 was n’t opposed by @entity126 rugby league club owner @entity138			1
he used to be head of operations at the football club , but had an acrimonious exit following @entity125 ’s takeover			0
shock : @entity145 owner @entity138 did n't oppose the @entity126 sports clashes this saturday @entity147 might have been discarded by @entity148 as ghost writer for his upcoming autobiography but the @entity152 sports columnist has emerged as front runner to be the next @entity15 sports editor			1
however , there appears to be a split of opinion on the selection panel as to whether the @entity15 want a talking head like @entity147 or a big story getter to replace the departing @entity14			1
the @entity161 are to lose their highly successful commercial chief @entity162 , who has remarkably brought in more than £ 750m worth of sponsorship and tv rights during nearly a decade dominated by a financial recession			0
@entity162 will be leaving in 2016 , giving the @entity161 two years notice to find a successor .			0

@entity5 hire @entity168 to help @entity169 through sexism scandal
@entity60 will be an @entity63 pundit for @entity65 final
@entity111 chairman will go to @entity114 final , not @entity132 game
@entity147 a *frontrunner* for @entity15 sports editor role
