by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter president @entity3 dismissed the idea of @entity5 as a threat -- and said his bigger fear is a nuclear weapon in @entity9			1
@entity3 made the remarks while speaking at the @entity11 in the @entity12			1
' @entity5 ’s actions are a problem , ' he said			0
' they do n’t pose the no. 1 national security threat to the @entity17			2
i continue to be much more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in @entity9			1
' ' [ ... ] which is part of the reason why the @entity17 , showing its continued international leadership , has organized a form over the last several years that ’s been able to help eliminate that threat in a consistent way , ' he said			2
the remarks were made in response to a reporter who asked if @entity46 's 2012 concerns about @entity5 's geopolitical power were valid			1
@entity3 seemed to dismiss the idea , and said that @entity5 was merely a ' regional power			2
' ' @entity5 is a regional power that is threatening some of its immediate neighbors — not out of strength , but out of weakness , ' he said			0
during the summit @entity3 , also praised the ' fundamental shift ' in international efforts to fight nuclear terrorism as 35 countries pledged tuesday to turn guidelines on nuclear security into national laws			1
at the close of a two - day summit , the group also agreed to open up their security procedures to independent review , a further step toward creating an international legal framework to thwart nuclear terrorism			1
the move is a joint initiative sponsored by host country the @entity73 , along with past summit hosts the @entity17 and @entity75			0
mr @entity3 also held a joint news conference with @entity73 prime minister @entity77 @entity3 , seen here speaking with @entity79 secretary general ban ki - moon , said @entity5 's actions ' don ¿ t pose the no. 1 national security threat to the @entity17 ' ' i believe this is essential to the security of the entire world , ' @entity3 said at a press conference wrapping up the summit			1
he added that more still needs to be done : ' given the catastrophic consequences of even a single attack , we can not be complacent			0
' all 53 countries that participated in the @entity11 in the @entity12 agreed tuesday to keep looking for ways to ensure that nuclear material does n't fall into the hands of terrorists			1
but the pledge to adopt nuclear guidelines into law and undergo external checks was endorsed by just 35 nations , including @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and the three summit hosts			2
notably absent from that agreement were @entity5 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
@entity113 and @entity114 did n't even attend			0
' we need to get the rest of the summit members to sign up to it , especially @entity5 , and we need to find a way to make this into permanent international law , ' said @entity122 of the @entity123			0
since @entity3 launched the summits in 2010 , the number of countries that have enough material to build a nuclear weapon has fallen from 39 to 25			1
when pressed about @entity5 's geopolitical power , @entity3 -- seen posing for a group photo -- said it was merely a ' regional power ' threatening neighbors ' out of weakness ' this summit featured new reduction commitments , with @entity106 , @entity138 and @entity139 pledging to reduce their stocks of highly enriched uranium and plutonium			1
other groups of nations pledged to step up efforts to prevent trafficking of nuclear material , boost maritime security and to develop low - enriched uranium for research reactors instead of the highly enriched , weapons - grade nuclear fuel currently widely used			1
' i 'll close by reminding everyone that one of the achievements of my first summit in 2010 was @entity159 's decision to remove all of its highly enriched uranium from its nuclear fuel sites , ' @entity3 said			1
' had that not happened , those dangerous nuclear materials would still be there now			0
and the difficult situation we 're dealing with in @entity159 today would involve yet another level of concern			0
' @entity3 went on to conclude that ' the more of this material we can secure , the safer all of our countries will be			2
' the summit statement also reminded countries to consider the potential threat posed by cyberterrorism			0
@entity175 president @entity174 said the nuclear summit was crucial at a time when ' international stability and security are being put into question in a very serious manner " — another reference to the @entity159 crisis			2
' it is therefore all the more important to show that we are united in our commitment to a multilateral order based on peace and the unequivocal respect of the rule of law , ' he said			0
@entity191 of the @entity192 said tuesday 's deal was significant because it marks ' a change in the way security is done			2
' @entity191 said the gains from reducing nuclear material will likely trail off in the future			0
in absence of a global treaty on nuclear security , the next phase in improving security will be for groups of like - minded countries to lead the way			1
that will put peer pressure among nations , she said , with none wanting to be seen as the most lax at safeguarding their nuclear material			0
agreeing to external checks , conducted under the auspices of the @entity217 , is especially important , she added .			0
