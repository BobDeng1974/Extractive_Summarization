by @entity0 lord justice @entity1 at his swearing in as @entity3 : he has been hired by @entity4 as an expert witness in a patent dispute the appeals - court judge who forced @entity8 to make a high profile apology to @entity4 has been hired by the @entity11 firm as an expert witness in its latest patent dispute			1
sir @entity1 will testify on behalf of @entity4 during the @entity17 @entity16 investigation into the company 's patent dispute with @entity20			1
the retired judge , who is now a professor of law at @entity22 , @entity23 , made headlines last year when he accused @entity8 of a ' lack of integrity '			1
it came the @entity28 said it would take them two weeks to properly comply with a court order that it publish a notice that it had lost an earlier legal fight with @entity4			0
sir @entity1 's involvement with @entity4 has raised eyebrows in the legal world			1
such expert witnesses are often paid thousands of dollars for appearances			0
@entity39 , a patent blogger and intellectual property consultant , who first spotted sir @entity43 € ™ s name in the case in filings to the @entity16 , said the involvement with @entity4 's latest patent dispute ' just does n't feel right '			1
' for someone so concerned with ' integrity ' it is utterly unusual to issue a high - profile and extreme ruling in favour of a particular party ... only to be hired as an expert by that same party in another dispute , ' he said			0
he added : ' it gives the impression that a judge who deals @entity4 's number one rival a huge @entity64 blow , in a way that i found very extreme and unjustified , will be generously rewarded			0
' for that reason alone , i think both @entity4 and sir @entity1 should not have done this			2
' what would people say if judge @entity72 , a few months after denying @entity8 a permanent injunction against @entity4 , returned to private practice and was hired as an " expert " by @entity4 in a @entity77 litigation with @entity20 ? ' in november last year , sir @entity1 was one of three @entity79 judges who ordered @entity8 to alter a statement on its website acknowledging it had lost a legal dispute with @entity4 over the @entity83			1
@entity8 had complained that the @entity83 was too similar to its @entity84			0
an @entity84 ( left ) is displayed next to @entity4 's @entity86 tab : a high court judge ruled the @entity83 was not ' cool ' enough to be confused with @entity8 's @entity84 - a decision upheld on appeal but a judge at the @entity91 in @entity23 ruled last july that the @entity83 was not ' cool ' enough to be confused with @entity8 's @entity84 - a decision upheld on appeal			2
in the subsequent litigation , @entity4 said @entity8 had on october 26 published a notice on its website acknowledging defeat - in ' purported compliance ' with a @entity79 order			0
but the firm complained that @entity8 had added an account of court proceedings in @entity77 and the @entity17 which was ' inaccurate and misleading '			0
' what @entity8 added was false and misleading , ' sir @entity1 said in a subsequently published written decision			2
' there is a false innuendo that the @entity109 court 's decision is at odds with decisions in other countries whereas that is simply not true			0
' order : the final statement that @entity8 linked to on the homepage of their website in the @entity109 bad @entity8 : the original notice posted on @entity8 's website , which a court said did not comply with its orders he added that @entity8 bosses had shown a ' lack of integrity ' by saying staff would need two weeks to make ' minor changes ' to the company website - and gave them 48 hours to comply			2
the court also ordered @entity8 to run a newspaper advert with the amended text telling the public of the ruling that @entity135 had not infringed its patents			0
in a written statement to the @entity139 , a @entity4 spokesman defended sir @entity1 's appointment as an expert witness for the company 's latest intellectual property dispute			1
' sir @entity1 is not a legal representative of @entity4 , ' the spokesman said			2
' a highly reputed intellectual property expert and academic , sir @entity1 has been contracted as an expert by a law firm that represents @entity4 in its case against @entity20			1

sir @entity1 will testify on @entity4 's behalf in dispute with @entity20
he *previously* accused @entity8 of a ' lack of integrity ' over its publication of a statement acknowledging it had lost patent dispute with @entity4
patent experts question move which they say ' just does n't feel right '
