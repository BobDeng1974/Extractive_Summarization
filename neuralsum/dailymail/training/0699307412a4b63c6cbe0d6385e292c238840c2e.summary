the bank is set to provide £ 40billion of newly - created cash every month for up to two years – potentially a total of almost £ 1trillion			1
@entity0 was last night poised to start printing billions of euros in a desperate bid to prop up the region ’s moribund economy ; the @entity5 is today expected to announce a programme of so - called quantitative easing as it steps up its fight against deflation and stagnation the policy – which involves the @entity5 buying up government bonds across the 19 nations of the eurozone – is intended to lessen the pressure on banks and encourage them to lend more money			1
it is hoped this will help households and businesses by making loans and mortgages cheaper			1
but critics of the policy say the banking system in @entity0 is so fragile that even with the huge injection of cash , banks will not feel secure enough to lend any more money			2
they also fear that it will let irresponsible governments off the hook too easily – and could discourage them from taking the tough decisions needed to tackle the root of the problem			0
the move , by @entity5 president @entity46 , will be closely watched in @entity47 as the eurozone is the @entity47 ’s largest trading partner			1
just as the collapse of the single currency bloc could wreak havoc in the @entity47 , a stronger and more prosperous neighbour could boost confidence on this side of the @entity56 and help exports			0
@entity58 has warned that the @entity47 is not ‘ immune ’ to the problems in the eurozone			0
but critics fear the @entity5 ’s plan is too little too late , and say it could tempt governments in the single currency bloc to renege on the reforms needed to boost growth and employment in the long - term			1
@entity68 , chairman of @entity69 , said : ‘ if quantitative easing is successful and creates confidence then that is a good thing			0
the risk is that the political progress on reform gets put on the back burner			0
then we get a lack of confidence			0
’ the move , by @entity5 president @entity46 , pictured , will be closely watched in @entity47 as the eurozone is the @entity47 ’s largest trading partner ; just as the collapse of the single currency bloc could wreak havoc in the @entity47 , a stronger and more prosperous neighbour could boost confidence on this side of the @entity56 and help exports @entity83 – chairman of financial services firm @entity84 and former head of @entity87 ’s central bank , the @entity86 – said the @entity5 can only ‘ buy time ’ for the eurozone			1
speaking at the @entity90 in @entity91 , he said that governments must take tough decisions to make the region more competitive			0
he said that without such action ‘ there will always be questions about the viability ’ of the single currency			0
it is a crucial week for the eurozone , with today ’s landmark decision by the @entity5 to be followed on sunday by elections in @entity104 that could see the radical left - wing @entity106 party seize power			1
it is feared that @entity106 ’s attempts to renegotiate @entity104 ’s bailout and tone down austerity will see the country leave the euro altogether – plunging the single currency bloc back into crisis			0
@entity83 – chairman of financial services firm @entity84 and former head of @entity87 ’s central bank , the @entity86 – said the @entity5 can only ‘ buy time ’ for the eurozone mr @entity46 is expected to outline his plans to save the euro in @entity122 today , following months of discussions amid stiff opposition to money - printing from @entity87			1
but , with prices across the eurozone falling 0.2 per cent in december , stoking fears of a prolonged period of deflation , mr @entity46 looks to have garnered enough support to act			2
a prolonged period of deflation – such as suffered in @entity133 – can cripple economies as it makes debts harder to repay and can lead to businesses and households holding off spending			2
this then has a kock - on effect , hitting corporate profits , wages and jobs			0
mr @entity83 said the @entity5 risked making a mistake			1
‘ if the @entity5 continues to buy time and the time is not used then you have to ask whether doing more of the same is the right policy , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity0 needs to continue to work at integration			0
‘ if that does not happen , the single currency area becomes an increasingly difficult project to run			0
’ he added : ‘ however much [ time ] @entity46 decides to buy i do n’t think you will see inflation for years			2

@entity5 is to supply £ 40b every month for two years
it is today expected to announce steps to fight deflation and stagnation
the plan is hoped to ease pressure on banks and encourage lending
