by @entity0 elephants are craftier than we imagined - and carry out raids on crops when the nights are at their darkest			2
scientists found that their foraging expeditions in @entity8 tend to vary with the lunar cycle			0
they found that fewer raids took place during a full moon - when farmers are more likely to spot the animals plundering their crops			0
researchers found that @entity8 elephants picked the darkest nights to raid crop fields the amount of crop damage also fell during the full moon phase , the research in and around @entity22 ’s @entity21 revealed			1
five villages on the park ’s northern boundary were selected for the @entity30 research , which recorded examples of elephants plundering crops being grown close to and within human settlements			1
co-author of the study dr @entity36 , lecturer in animal behaviour at @entity38 , said : ‘ our results support the belief that elephants alter their behaviour to reduce the risks of encountering humans			2
’ she said the fact they raid crops ‘ almost exclusively ’ at night indicates they only go near villages when they feel they are harder to discover			0
dr @entity51 said : ‘ an elephant ’s awareness of the higher risk of being detected on moonlit nights , because of the visual advantage gained by humans , could account for the changes in their behaviour during the lunar cycle and explain why elephants are less likely to venture close to villages during the full moon			0
the amount of crop damage also fell during the full moon phase , the research in and around @entity22 's @entity21 revealed ‘ some animals that vary their activity according to the lunar cycle have an internally arising biological rhythm ; alternatively they may be basing their decision making on local conditions at the time			1
‘ many animals alter their behaviour according to varying light levels and the perceived risk of predation , and this is likely to be a partly evolved , partly learned response			0
’ the research , published in the @entity77 , could be used to help protect farms from damage by elephants .			1

@entity30 researchers observed groups in @entity22 's @entity21
their findings could help protect farms from damage caused by elephants
