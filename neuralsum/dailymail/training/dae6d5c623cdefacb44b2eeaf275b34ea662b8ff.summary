by @entity0 published : 14:29 est , 29 november 2013 updated : 14:29 est , 29 november 2013 @entity1 has accidentally sent an email to protesters in which he called them ' numb - nuts ' and the police ' daft ' a @entity9 mp has called police ' daft ' and branded demonstrators ' numb - nuts ' in an email accidentally sent to a protest camp on his own doorstep			1
the email was reportedly meant for a member of @entity1 's staff but he accidentally copied in members of the occupy group who were camped on the driveway of his constituency office			1
mr @entity1 , mp for @entity25 and @entity26 , has been involved in a week - long standoff with six activists who are opposed to his anti-squatters stance			1
they had been outside his office on @entity32 , @entity25 - @entity33 's former constituency hq - since friday last week but have since been evicted			1
according to reports , mr @entity1 's staff initially allowed them to camp there to stop them blocking the pavement outside , but became frustrated and eventually hired bailiffs to remove them			2
according to the @entity42 , the email said : ' i am mightily peed off at the @entity44			0
i feel like sending the @entity45 to the commissioner saying your fat advice landed us with the @entity45			0
' of course this will inhibit every other demo as we will simply refuse to allow anyone onto our property			0
so tempting to say — you are all numb - nuts as i am not the owner of the property and it is they you should be dealing with about your presence			1
' the ' bill ' refers to the cost of hiring the private bailiffs used in the eviction			0
mr @entity1 helped to draft a bill which made squatting in residential building a criminal offence , a law which the protesters oppose			1
six protesters , including @entity70 and @entity71 ( pictured ) were camping outside mp @entity1 's office until they were evicted yesterday morning by bailiffs protester @entity74 , 43 , said : ' it is n’t a nice way to refer to your constituents			1
we have been politely co-operating with the police and we have been very respectful in our protest			2
' we were n’t trespassing as he gave us permission			0
he has been disrespectful to people trying to have their say			0
' the group , who have now moved across the road , say they plan to stay until mr @entity1 joins them for a night to discuss their concerns			1
it is understood the mp had previously emailed them and asked to meet , an offer they had agreed to			2
the email was accidentally sent to them instead of being sent to a member of mr @entity1 's staff speaking about the camp , mr @entity1 said : ' the squatters and the camp were disrupting my constituency office and its presence was intimidating			1
' a polite request for the squatters to leave was ignored as were instructions on how to arrange an appointment			0
it was decided that we had no alternative but to lawfully remove the squatters from the property			0
' last night 50 activists joined a demonstration at the new camp which was broadcast online			0
a @entity44 spokesman said the force would not comment on the email			0
mr @entity1 's office has previously said it would not be commenting on the message , and calls from @entity121 were not immediately answered .			2
