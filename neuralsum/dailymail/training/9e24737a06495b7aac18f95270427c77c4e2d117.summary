by @entity0 published : 09:55 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 09:55 est , 1 november 2013 @entity1 is a death row inmate who raped and killed a three - year - old girl an @entity4 death row inmate sentenced to die for raping and killing a three - year - old girl is expected to testify at a hearing in federal court today as his lawyers challenge the state 's new , never - tried lethal injection system			1
attorneys for condemned killer @entity1 want a federal judge to delay @entity1 ' nov. 14 execution while they gather evidence as part of their lawsuit against the two - drug process			1
the @entity18 announced a new execution policy last month and said on monday that it would use that system 's second option : a combination of a sedative and painkiller never tried before in a @entity26 execution			1
@entity1 ' attorneys say the department 's announcements came too close to the execution date to allow a meaningful challenge			1
the state says nothing is substantially different about the new system			0
judge @entity35 originally granted @entity1 permission to testify in person , then switched to the video testimony when it was clear courtroom technology could handle the unusual arrangement			2
there are no recent examples of @entity4 death row inmates testifying in person or by video in federal court cases			0
the hearing today began by focusing on the state 's decision to allow the prisons ' director or death house warden to delegate responsibility for changes in the execution process			0
that could include any deviation from the policy , down to paperwork documenting a particular step			0
@entity4 has walked away from that promise with the new policies , @entity62 , an attorney for @entity1 , told the judge			2
' close enough for government work is not acceptable in applying this death penalty protocol ' , @entity62 said			0
@entity68 will be injected with a never before used combination of an intravenous combination of midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller an attorney for the state said @entity4 is committed to carrying out the execution in a humane , dignified and constitutional manner and understands that commitment			1
' the state will do what the state says it will do , ' said @entity83 , an assistant @entity4 attorney general			0
@entity1 ' attorneys are also challenging the state 's new policy for the lethal drugs it will use			1
the state 's first choice is a specialty dose of pentobarbital mixed by a compounding pharmacy			0
if that ca n't be obtained - as in the case of @entity1 ' execution - the state will use a new , two - drug method to put @entity1 to death			1
@entity1 ' lawyers argue in court filings that the two drugs could cause severe side effects , including painful vomiting			2
those drugs @entity4 is proposing to use on @entity1 will cause him to stop breathing within a few minutes , an anesthesiologist said in a statement thursday as part of a filing by the state in support of the new method			2
irreversible brain and heart damage will follow and the inmate will die a few minutes later , according to @entity118 doctor @entity117			0
the drugs are midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller .			1

@entity1 is *due* to be executed on nov. 14 but his attorneys want it delayed while they gather evidence for lawsuit over two - drug process
the new lethal injection is midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller
