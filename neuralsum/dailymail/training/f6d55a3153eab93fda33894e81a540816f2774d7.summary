by @entity0 @entity2 's life changed when she was 12 after moving to @entity3 to be closer to her sister the day that changed my life prompted a move to @entity3 , where i fell in love with acting			1
it happened shortly after my 12th birthday			2
my older sister @entity12 had emigrated to @entity3 with her husband and their tiny baby			1
i remained in @entity16 , @entity17 , with my parents , where my father worked for the police force			2
we did n't have a telephone at home , so one afternoon we arranged for her to call us at our local phone box			1
we all huddled around the receiver			0
it was a hugely emotional telephone call because in those days she may as well have been in another world			1
she 'd travelled by boat , and letters and rare telephone calls were our only form of communication			0
it was wonderful to speak to my sister , but that telephone call upset all of us because we missed her so much			1
weeks of debate followed until it was decided that we 'd move to @entity3 , where my parents could see their grandchild grow up			1
i 'd already had a nomadic childhood , caused by my father @entity44 careers as a civil servant and with the police force			0
i was born in @entity47 and moved to @entity17 when i was six			2
i 'd got used to being flexible about setting down roots and making new friends			0
then , aged 13 , i was transported to @entity3			1
it was wonderful to be close to my sister again but there was so much more that i loved about my new surroundings			1
i remember not needing a winter coat and rarely wearing shoes because you could walk around barefoot			0
a couple of years later , i also had a lovely boyfriend with a speedboat			0
@entity60 schooling was ahead of @entity3 's , so i was drumming my fingers with boredom in class			1
i enjoyed drama though , and my teacher encouraged me to join an amateur dramatics group , which i loved			2
soon i knew i wanted to be a professional actress			0
@entity68 in one of her earlier acting roles in @entity71 - 1985 i went on to train at a theatre company in @entity73 and the more experience i gained , the more diverse roles i wanted to play			1
at 21 i was cast as @entity76 , the nude , in the play @entity79			0
@entity3 were a bit prudish , though , so i was n't allowed to be starkers			2
i stood on a plinth , wearing three micro @entity83 , which i was grateful for			0
as much as i adored my sister , her family and my parents , by the age of 23 i knew i had to return to @entity88 if i was to make a good living as an actress			1
it was a huge decision and a very painful one for all of us			0
luckily the move to @entity88 worked out well for me			2
i got an agent and enough work to afford somewhere to live			0
long before series like @entity97 and the @entity99 and @entity100 films i was cast in wonderful tv dramas like @entity102			0
my parents have passed away now but @entity12 still lives in @entity3 , and these days we fly to see each other as often as possible			1
the older we get , the closer we become			0
and if it had n't been for her phone call that afternoon , my life could have turned out quite differently			1
series 3 of @entity109 is out now on dvd .			0

@entity68 ' sister moved to @entity3 when she was younger
after an emotional phone call to her , her parents decided to emigrate too
@entity2 loved @entity3 but returned to @entity88 at 23 to pursue acting
