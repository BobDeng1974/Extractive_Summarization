the @entity0 plans to ease pressure on @entity2 ‘ on the cheap ’ by doubling the number of semi-qualified surgery assistants			1
the @entity6 hopes to recruit more than 200 ‘ physician associates ’ , who will undertake a two - year university course			1
fully - fledged family doctors typically take ten years to train			2
the associates will be taught how to carry out tests , diagnose patients and decide whether they should see a specialist			1
the interminable wait : @entity16 of shame at a surgery in @entity19 , @entity20 , as people hope for appointment they will then be allowed to take appointments themselves , but will mainly see younger , otherwise healthy patients – leaving doctors to see those with complicated , long - term conditions			1
the scheme is aimed at addressing a looming shortage of @entity2 , which comes as demand on surgeries increases due to our rising , ageing population			1
last week the @entity34 revealed that desperate practices in @entity36 and @entity37 are offering doctors golden hellos of £ 20,000 to fill empty posts , while patients at a surgery in @entity19 , @entity20 , regularly queue in the cold from 6.30am to ensure they get a same - day appointment			1
the @entity0 already has 200 physician associates working in surgeries in the @entity46 and @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
they are supervised by a gp who checks their patient notes , but are qualified to undertake most tasks , including examining patients , taking their medical history , ordering tests and referring them to specialists			1
they can not prescribe new drugs , but may order repeat prescriptions			0
they earn between £ 24,000 and £ 38,000 a year , depending on experience – a fraction of the sums received by @entity2 , which range from £ 55,000 to £ 105,000 a year			1
the @entity0 hopes to recruit 200 ' physician associates ' who will undertake a two - year course and be able to diagnose patients and decide whether they should see a specialist , but will earn considerably less than @entity2 their training is also far cheaper than the £ 500,000 it costs for a fully qualified family doctor			1
many associates previously worked as nurses , paramedics or physiotherapists , and every applicant for the two - year course must already have a science - based degree			1
the recruitment drive – which is being overseen by @entity82 , the @entity84 ’s training wing – has prompted concern among @entity0 staff , who warn it could put safety at risk			1
one gp wrote on the website of @entity91 , the doctors ’ magazine : ‘ when a role is created to essentially save money you must expect compromises			0
here we are accepting compromises to care			0
’ another said it was wrong to assume their work could be undertaken by ‘ partly - qualified people ’ , while a nurse called it ‘ medicine on the cheap ’			2
physician associates are a cross between doctors and nurses			2
they must already hold a science - based degree before undertaking another two years ’ training to qualify			0
about 200 currently work in gp surgeries across @entity112			2
they must operate alongside a qualified doctor , with the level of supervision depending on their experience			0
the role was created in the @entity120 in the 1960s to address a shortage of gps in rural areas			0
@entity120 now has almost 70,000 of them – and some have already been imported to the @entity112			0
they added : ‘ the government want to do away with gps and registered nurses and replace them with minimum - wage people with little training			2
’ one concern is that physician associates – also known as assistants – do not belong to an official register like doctors and nurses			0
this means they can not be struck off for making serious errors			0
dr @entity141 , deputy chairman of the @entity143 ’s gp committee , said : ‘ patients want and need more gps and the priority must be to do all we can to recruit new gps and retain those currently employed in the workforce			2
' however , the current situation is so critical that any extra support for general practice is to be encouraged ... but the implications and practicalities will need to be carefully considered			0
’ physician associates are also employed in some @entity158 units and operating theatres , where they undertake similar tasks to junior doctors			2
professor @entity162 , chief executive of @entity82 , said : ‘ with the appropriate training and supervision , they are a fantastic asset ... they are incredibly popular and the junior doctors find them fantastic members of the team to help share appropriate workload			0
‘ but these people are n’t doctors			0
they have a different skill set ... but used in the right way they are an invaluable part to providing the best possible care			0

@entity0 hopes to recruit 200 associates who will undertake two - year course
they will be taught how to carry out tests and be able to diagnose patients
then they can take appointments themselves but will see younger people
wages will range from £ *24k* to £ *38k* - a fraction of sums received by @entity2
comes as demand on surgeries increases due to rising , ageing population
