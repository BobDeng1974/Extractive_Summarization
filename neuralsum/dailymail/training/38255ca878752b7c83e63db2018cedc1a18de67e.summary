by @entity0 published : 05:17 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 11:23 est , 7 august 2013 a film fan has combined his love for the big screen and his passion for cars to create a fleet of iconic vehicles from the movies , including the @entity10 and @entity11			1
after building cars for almost 30 years , @entity12 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , grew bored with the usual @entity16 and @entity17			1
so he decided to test his skills on some unique vehicles which have gone down in movie and tv history			0
a few years ago , @entity12 decided it would be a great idea to combine his love for cars with his passion for films , so he started building functional replicas of some of the most popular vehicles from the movie and tv over the decades			1
starting his search for old cars on @entity48 , @entity49 or by word of mouth , @entity12 then gets to work on them , transforming them from shells into dream rides that movie buffs would snap up in a second			1
@entity12 's collection also includes @entity11 , a 1963 @entity58 @entity59 is sure to be impressed with this replica of @entity33 , the artificially intelligent and nearly indestructible car which helped him fight crime in tv show @entity34 ' we 've been doing cars off and on for the last 25 to 30 years and it came a time that we had seen enough @entity68 and @entity16 at car shows and it was time to bring out some iconic stuff that people could actually touch and feel , ' @entity12 said when speaking to wsbtv.com			1
@entity12 's collection includes replicas of @entity11 , kitt from @entity34 and the car driven by @entity76 in @entity78 's famous race scene			1
his batmobile is the most impressive of the extensive fleet and is always guaranteed to turn heads wherever it goes			0
complete with retractable machine guns , it also pumps fire and smoke out the back			0
fans of the @entity88 and @entity89 hit movie @entity78 will recognise this car , which was raced along @entity92 at the end of the film a copy of @entity96 from @entity97 has pride of place in @entity12 's garage			1
@entity101 is the only @entity96 to receive a star title credit in a movie @entity12 's version took three years to build			2
all aspects are custom made and it is almost identical to the original			0
and it 's not just for show , you can actually drive it , although @entity12 says it 's not easy			2
' that batmobile is a little bit harder to get out on the street for the simple reason there are so many people just taking videos and pictures and it 's hard to change lanes , it 's hard to speed up or slow down , ' @entity12 said			2
' we normally have to have a chase vehicle ( in ) front , back and sides of it just to keep everything safe			0
heads are often turned when they see @entity10 and @entity35 driving around the street of @entity13 the experienced builder juggles between 25 to 35 cars at one time as his projects usually require parts from multiple vehicles to create the finished replica @entity12 puts as much effort into the interiors of the cars as he does the exteriors , as you can see from the inside of @entity35 ' of course if we drive it , we try and keep the machine guns down inside the car			1
' the experienced builder is often juggling between 25 to 35 cars at one time as his projects usually require parts from multiple vehicles to create the finished product			2
so which movie will provide @entity12 with his next burst of inspiration ? his upcoming projects include @entity155 from the movie cars , an @entity158 van and @entity159 from @entity160			1
building the replicas mostly for fun , @entity12 says he loves the reaction from kids and film fans			0
he also carries out custom work for clients to help pay the bills			0
but his labour of love is not always easy , especially when it comes to getting parts for unique cars			0
he said : ' it 's hard to go to @entity175 and buy parts for the @entity10			0
so you end up making everything for it			0

@entity12 from @entity13 , @entity14 has built a fleet of cars from the movies
they include the @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity35
his next projects will be the @entity158 van and @entity159 from @entity160
