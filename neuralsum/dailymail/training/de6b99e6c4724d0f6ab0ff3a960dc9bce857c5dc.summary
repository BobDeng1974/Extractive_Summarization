@entity0 chewed up and spat out @entity1 with a deadly double but the @entity4 striker found himself at the centre of a fresh bite row as @entity8 users suggested he had a nibble of @entity10			1
@entity0 ’s first - half goals have @entity4 in the driving seat ahead of the second leg of their @entity15 last - 16 tie but it was his actions at the end of the 2 - 1 win that threatened to overshadow his classy finishing			1
the 90 minutes had come and gone when the former @entity23 star ran across @entity10 and as the @entity1 defender ’s arm flicks towards @entity0 , he appears to move his head down to meet it			1

originally protests innocence but then apologises and is handed four - month ban from world football and fined £ 66,000 by @entity72			1
at first , it looked like @entity0 was moving his mouth towards @entity10 ' hand			2
however , another vine posted on the social media site appeared to show the @entity79 international attempt to run past the @entity1 defender 's outstretched arm			0
one @entity8 user , @ @entity83 posted : ' ( sic ) pretty sure @entity0 tried to bite @entity10 here			1
' @ @entity84 wrote : ' ( sic ) @entity0 trying to bite someone again the man has problems ' @ @entity88 said : ' ( sic ) was @entity0 about to @entity89 ' there was no reaction from @entity10 or his @entity1 team - mates but we all know @entity0 , who cost @entity4 £ 75million from @entity23 , has history			1
before the @entity95 shelled out £ 22m for the @entity96 , @entity0 had already developed a ' bad - boy ' reputation with @entity51 in @entity99			1
his play - acting antics were one thing , but in november 2010 , a new side to the forward was born			0
as @entity50 and @entity51 players scrapped off the ball , @entity0 chomped down on opposing midfielder @entity49 's shoulder			1
no red card followed , but a seven - match ban meant he never played in the @entity110 again			2
and then @entity23 entered the fray			0
@entity0 was banned for seven games and never played in the @entity110 again after biting @entity49 @entity49 shows his bite mark to a team - mate during the game between @entity51 and @entity50 in 2010 @entity0 was given an eight - match ban after being charged with racially abusing @entity52 in 2011 @entity0 was first embroiled in a biting storm in @entity118 when clashing with @entity56 @entity0 appeared to bite down on @entity60 defender @entity56 's arm during a @entity121 game in 2013 @entity0 was banned for eight games after biting @entity56 at @entity123 @entity0 ( holding a book about him ) and @entity125 make their way through @entity128 on tuesday @entity0 had already been given an eight - match ban after being charged with racially abusing @entity53 's @entity52 during a @entity121 game in 2011 , before biting @entity60 defender @entity56 in a 2013 fixture			1
he went on to score the equaliser but after that , his reputation was set in the eyes of the @entity137 public , and press			0
' his behaviour is not befitting of any player wearing a @entity23 shirt , ' chief executive @entity139 said			0
@entity144 added : ' players are always replaceable , it does not matter how good they think they are			0
' @entity0 strongly denied the accusations of racism against @entity52 , but had no choice but to apologise after the incident with @entity56			2
he had lost his temper , and inexcusably bitten the @entity153 defender 's shoulder			2
the @entity54 handed out a 10 - game ban to @entity0 , who then tried to angle a move away from @entity123			1
@entity158 laid down £ 35m to give the striker a fresh start , but @entity23 rejected the bid and placed their trust in his ability			0
they were n't wrong , as @entity0 went on to net 31 goals and become the top scorer in the 2013/14 @entity121 season despite missing the first five games			2
he almost lead the @entity95 to the title , and a summer switch to some of the world 's best was again mooted			0

full of confidence , named the @entity174 and @entity184 in @entity118 , even scoring the goal to all - but knock out @entity187 's side in @entity68			0
however , he was about to return to the centre of attention for all the wrong reasons			0
the prolific star first said he ' lost his balance ' when appearing to bite @entity65 's @entity64 in @entity79 's final group stage game			1
again , his side went on to score a crucial late goal			0
@entity64 protested to the referee , lowering his shirt to present bite marks on his shoulder as the pair clashed in the box as a cross came in			2
the third bite in his professional career earned him a nine - game ban from world football , his eventual statement apologising to the defender was similar to that of the sorrow he expressed to @entity56			1
' the truth is that my colleague @entity64 suffered the physical result of a bite in the collision he suffered with me , ' said @entity0			2
' i deeply regret what occurred			0
' i apologise to @entity64 and the entire football family			0

' i believe i am on the right path now , dealing with the people who can help me , the right kind of people			0
his form in recent weeks as he has seamlessly fitted into @entity251 's side has been impressive			0
his performance against @entity1 in the @entity15 last - 16 first leg was sublime			1
@entity254 had no chance with the two goals			0
but has he tarnished that reputation further after clashing with @entity10 ? @entity0 scored both goals as @entity4 beat @entity1 2 - 1 on tuesday night			1
