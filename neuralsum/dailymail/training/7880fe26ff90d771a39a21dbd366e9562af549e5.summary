by @entity0 @entity1 collected information about the shape of 500,000 women 's breasts to create a range of bras designed to fit different shaped bodies shopping for a comfortable bra can sometimes prove a surprisingly complicated and frustrating ordeal			1
but now one company claims to have created a collection of bras that fit differently shaped women perfectly - based on information collected from over 500,000 females			1
over two years , @entity17 used seven million different data points to analyse the shape of all these women			1
and they discovered a staggering 6,000 different breast shapes			1
data scientists in @entity25 trawled through the information to create a ‘ @entity29 ’ line of underwear that promises to fit perfectly , @entity23 reported			1
the company launched in 2012 as an online fitting room that let customers find a suitable bra using an online quiz , which includes a clever algorithm			1
the method was developed by @entity37 and @entity38 and uses information given by a customer in a questionnaire to determine her shape and what kind of bra she should be wearing			2
now that the company has been trading for two years , it has built up a considerable amount of data which has allowed it to personalise bras further and create a colour - coded system called @entity51 , which looks a little like a paint chart			1
‘ you would not believe the amount of data our system has to deal with in real time			2
it knocks us on our butt sometimes , ’ chief executive @entity37 said			0
now that the company has been trading for two years , it has built up a considerable amount of data which has allowed it to personalise bras further , and create a colour - coded system called @entity51 ( pictured ) which looks a little like a paint chart there are eight different categories on the colour wheel ( pictured ) , which are based on the size , shape and curvature of breasts			1
' @entity73 ' is the most common shape , with around 28 per cent of women having full and round breasts the system claims to help people with smaller rib cages and large breasts avoid a bra ‘ muffin top ’ , and those with a shallower chest , dodge painful underwired bras			1
there are eight different categories on the colour wheel , which are based on the size , shape and curvature of breasts			2
‘ @entity73 ’ is the most common shape , with around 28 per cent of women having full and round breasts			2
@entity90 said that curvature is the most important feature in trying to build a comfortable bra , but it is often overlooked by retailers			0
@entity95 launched two years ago and aims to find the perfect bras for its customers by using a unique algorithm			0
different shapes are pictured she explained that if women have a flat sternum , underwiring in bras can cause pain , regardless of how well the rest of the bra fits			2
the duo are still working on perfecting the algorithm , and admitted that their bras for ‘ @entity113 ’ type women do not fit as well as they might			2
@entity90 thinks that as more women take the company ’s online quiz , their product line will diversify and women with more unusual proportions will be able to buy a bra that really fits them			1
‘ this is just the beginning of the future of shopping			0
true&co has only just scratched the surface on its goal to deliver on the perfect fit , ’ she said			0
a @entity131 lingerie company has created a concept bra that claims to be able to sense when a woman is in love			0
@entity135 recently engineered a concept bra that only undoes when ‘ true love ’ is detected using a built - in heart monitor , that syncs with a smartphone app. the bra is not currently on sale and there is no indication as to whether it will be made , but the prototype has a front clasp with a sensor and a light that glows pink if the wearer is in love with a person nearby			0
in a promotional video , the sensor monitors the smart bra wearer ’s heart rate and transmits the data in realtime to an @entity159 app using a @entity161 connection			0
an app seemingly processes the data – measuring heart rate elevation using a specially built algorithm as well as pre-set data - and only when a woman ’s heart rate is suitably elevated and she is in love does the bra catch open			0
while some would - be wearers might worry that any excitement might cause their underwear to ping off , the creators of the bra say that the catch will only be released when a woman is in love so that her @entity179 ( part of the adrenal gland ) secretes the hormone @entity183 , which increases her heart rate			0
@entity131 lingerie firm @entity185 has engineered a concept bra that only undoes when ' true love ' is detected using a built - in heart monitor and works with a smartphone app			0

@entity17 used *7million* data points to analyse shapes of women 's breasts
these points were taken from a total of 500,000 women
data scientists identified a staggering 6,000 different breast shapes
the information has been used to create a new range of bras
shoppers can decide which one suits their shape using an online quiz
