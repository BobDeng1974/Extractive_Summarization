by @entity0 trainers have been the footwear staple this season ; they were on countless catwalks at fashion week and every celebrity owns a pair of designer kicks			1
sick of the trend ? sorry folks , it 's here to stay for another season so grab yourself some sneakers			1
and no , we do n't mean a subtle pair of black on black @entity18 , this season the humble trainer has undergone a total re-brand and for @entity21 it 's souped up , wedged and , as @entity22 says , practically on steroids			1
once the reserve of the super fit , the traditional running shoe has been given some serious style credentials in its new funky form			1
step to it : this season , the trainer trend takes a psychedelic twist and the louder and brighter , the better			1
this @entity34 design , left , will , however , set you back £ 1,025 and @entity37 's offering , right , costs a cool £ 700 it all started at @entity37 , where @entity39 sent @entity40 and co down the catwalk in colourful tweed trainers and the fash pack followed suit			1
since then @entity45 , editor of love magazine , has collaborated with trainer makers @entity47 to create wild looking designs combining neon colours and animal print , while @entity53 ’s designs for trainer giant @entity54 have been a huge hit			1
long - time fan : model - of - the - moment @entity40 is rarely seen off duty without a pair of pimped up trainers on , like the @entity60 ( right ) @entity63 - born designer @entity62 designed stand - out led @entity64 for topshop.the light - up wedge trainers have already been spotted on @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 - however , at £ 350 , they do n't come cheap			1
so high into the stratosphere of the fashion gods has the blinged up , custom trainer risen , that @entity73 has devoted its entire shoe department ( the largest in the world ) to sneakers			2
a massive central display is devoted to a single designer , alternating regularly to show all the seasons trainer trends			2
@entity81 , shoe buying manager for @entity73 , says : ' it 's a revolution			2
out of all our footwear categories we are repeating orders mostly on flats and trainers			1
they are selling out across every price point			2
' ‘ from high street and sports labels to high fashion , it really is the most fun and democratic show trend we ’ve seen in ages			2
’ famous fans : @entity96 and @entity69 love their souped up trainer styles and it seems they both have a pair for every day of the week first look : the wacky shoes were unveiled at @entity62 's @entity21 runway show and they 're coming to a store near you next week of course she 's got some ! savvy dresser @entity66 has already got her hands on the coveted trainers and it seems the designers themselves also agree			1
@entity113 , creative director at @entity114 , said : ' there 's definitely a radical shift towards lower heels			2
sneakers are really on trend			2
' girls are getting used to being able to run about and i do n't think they are going back to the big high heels			0
' celebrities ca n't get enough of running shoes off duty , and the latest versions loved by include creations designs in rare animal skins , bespoke pairs and serious designer label bling			0
but how do you pull them off this season ? @entity22 's @entity135 mused : ' wear them with your skate gear , wear them with your ballgown , this is footwear with cross-occasion appeal			1
' step out in glitter - bright or colour - blocked versions , or those with jewelled flower details - there 's something out there to satisfy even the most reluctant of trainer - wearers			0
' pricy : @entity148 is currently the queen of sneakers , with one extremely long waiting list for her wedged trainer , which comes in a variety of funky designs and costs several hundred pounds @entity156 : the @entity157 ( £ 85 ) can be customised on nike.com with a choice of colours , patterns and material for every part of the sneaker get creative : the classic @entity164 is as popular now as it ever has been , but now comes in a kaleidoscopic range of designs and colours ( £ 150 , nike.com ) trainers are also known as as kicks , trabs daps , sandshoes , gym boots or joggers , gutties , or canvers , according to @entity175			1

at first , the market for sneakers was small and practically invisible , but after the @entity197 , the @entity196 turned to sports and athletes as a way to demonstrate moral fibre and patriotism			0
a huge breakthrough came in when the @entity204 were revived after the @entity205 , attracting more fans not only to sports , but to sneakers as well			0
the 1950s gave @entity196 families more leisure time , and as the baby boom started , more families chose to dress their youth in sneakers as school dress codes relaxed			0
in the early 1960s , sneakers were imported to the @entity196 from @entity215 , but accounted for only a small portion of the market until @entity157 founders @entity218 and @entity219 began importing @entity221 shoes ( 1950s ) under the name @entity223			0
by the 1970s and 80s there were shoes for football , jogging , basketball , running - every sport had its own shoe and trainers had graduated to the movies			1
