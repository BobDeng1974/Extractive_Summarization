@entity33 - 5.5 not the best of showings in front of the watching @entity37 manager			2
@entity38 - 6.5 despite the score he tried to keep his team going , but @entity5 's movement was too good			1
passion : @entity4 @entity38 did not give up hope of helping @entity4 get back into the game @entity45 - 6.5 impressed with his quick passing of the ball but against @entity5 bossed the middle			1

@entity62 - 6.5 ca n't question his work - rate but too often drifted away from the centre			0
eyes on the ball : @entity4 's @entity62 worked hard but could n't break down @entity5 's defence subs : @entity69 ( for @entity70 , 5.5 ) , @entity71 ( for @entity45 59 , 6 ) , @entity72 ( for @entity73 , 6 )			1
not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77			0
@entity78 - 6 a tough test after initial success			0

@entity94 - 7.5 caught out by the odd long ball but tidied up brilliantly and made good interceptions			0

nobody in @entity109 does it better			0

@entity131 - 7.5 like @entity6 he beat defenders with ease			1
was not put off by @entity27 's arrival			2
running man : the pace of @entity37 international @entity6 troubled @entity4 's defence subs : can ( for @entity139 , 6 ) @entity140 ( for @entity27 61 , 6 ) , @entity141 ( for @entity6 86 ) not used : @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145			1

@entity151 - 7 handled the game well , though the penalty had an impact			2
@entity4 will say it was soft , but if you get caught on the wrong side and put your hands on someone , you run that risk			2
