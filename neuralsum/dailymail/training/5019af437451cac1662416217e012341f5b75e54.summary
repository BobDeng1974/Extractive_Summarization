for many people swimming with sharks with no safety net is the stuff of nightmares			2
but for @entity5 - known as the ' shark warrior ' - that is the problem			1
she is trying to convince people that the creatures are not the man - eating monsters depicted in @entity12 and are crucial to the health of the world 's oceans			1
these incredible shots show the moment the @entity19 free diver swam with tiger sharks , considered one of the most deadly species in the world			1
she hopes that by swimming with the creatures she can show they are not as dangerous as people think			2
in the stunning pictures shot off @entity29 , @entity5 comes with inches of the tiger sharks and even touches them in some images			1
@entity5 , who runs the campaign organisation @entity54 , wants fewer shark nets in the sea to protect swimmers			1
she says they are mainly unnecessary and actually kill sharks , which get caught up			0
@entity5 said the nets are ' wiping out our tiger shark population ' and said it also harms humans because of the amount of money generated by eco-tourists who come to see them			2
conservationists say the nets also kill large numbers of dolphins , turtles and rays			0
determined : @entity5 ( right ) quit her job to set up the @entity54 organisation in 2003 and campaign for the protection of shark free dive : @entity5 said she hoped images such as these of her with a lemon shark will help change perceptions about these important creatures camouflage : tiger sharks are perfectly hidden in the ocean because they look blue from the top and white from underneath them make them hard to see underwater : @entity5 ( pictured in a different shoot wearing a wetsuit ) says shark nets kill the different species of shark as well as dolphins and turtles @entity5 said she been surprised at the reaction to the stunning photographs			1
she wrote : ' little did i know that [ the photos ] would inspire people the way they have			0
' i had the photos taken to show people that despite making myself as vulnerable as i could by wearing only a bikini and freediving with the sharks , they still did not harm me			2
' they are powerful images and they have worked well to support my efforts in changing people 's perceptions of sharks			0
' tiger sharks are second on the list of recorded attacks on humans , behind the great white shark			0
however most attacks are not fatal			0
the species is classed as a near threatened species and it is under pressure of over fishing and illegal finning			0
they are also hunted for their distinctive striped skin			0
beautiful : @entity5 set up the @entity54 organisation to fight for shark species across the world and campaign against nets serene : the conservationist gets close to sharks to try and prove that they are not the man - eating monsters portrayed in films like jaws stunning : the conservationist said shark nets , finning and over-fishing are ' wiping out ' the crucial shark population			1

@entity5 said she wanted to be as vulnerable as possible to show sharks are not born man - eaters
