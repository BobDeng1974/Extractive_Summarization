he also said her husband @entity202 deserved both the ‘ @entity203 and balanced award for perfect objectivity and the @entity207 memorial thong for relentless self - effacement and shirking of the limelight '			2
turning to the @entity52 , he went on : ' it ’s also a pity that his honour @entity3 can not be here so he could receive the @entity213 award for commitment to truth - telling for his wonderful comments : " i do n’t really need any lessons in freedom of speech , mr @entity182 , really i do n't "			1

' speaking earlier , culture secretary @entity256 urged mps to await next week 's publication before rushing to judgment on how to reform newspaper regulation , but she said the status quo was ' not an option '			2
speaking at @entity249 questions , she added : ' the principles that will drive any solution to the problems we face with regards to the @entity46 are that we need to have an independent regulator that needs to be tough and certainly doing everything to preserve free speech			0

but @entity329 , a co-founder of the proposed new regulator alongside @entity331 , the @entity326 chairman , told @entity333 ’s @entity332 that there was widespread support for the new body which would be ‘ the friend of good journalism and the scourge of bad journalism ’			0
asked how the new regulator will get round the ‘ @entity342 ’ and ensure full co-operation from all the main newspaper groups , @entity329 said : ‘ i am confident that all publishers will sign up			0
