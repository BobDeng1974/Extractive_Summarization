he may be a noted team man but @entity1 admits he has his sights on some personal glory as @entity4 prepare for the next phase of their bid for the @entity7			2
@entity8 this season with @entity4 , who face @entity11 in the quarter - finals starting wednesday night at the @entity13 , would make @entity1 only the second player to win @entity17 football 's top trophy with three clubs having held it during his time at @entity20 and @entity21			1
' there is one player who has won three champions @entity24 with three different clubs : [ @entity28 ] @entity27			0
of course it is in my mind			0
the end of my career is near , ' @entity1 admitted to @entity34			0
@entity1 lines up for @entity4 on wednesday night against @entity11 at the @entity13 the @entity7 first leg quarter - final is the next step in his quest to win the title with three clubs ' i do n't have many years left but it is one of the targets			1
it is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the @entity7 is special , ' @entity1 said			2
@entity1 won the @entity7 in his first season at @entity20 when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005			1
and last season he was part of @entity51 's side to take the title , even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to be a pundit rather than a player for the final win over @entity58			0
@entity1 trains under the watchful eye of manager @entity60 who is keen to add to his @entity63 victories @entity27 won the title a total of four times in his illustrious career - in 1995 with @entity68 , 1998 with @entity21 and twice with @entity69 , in 2003 and 2007			1
at 33 and with a club as strong as @entity4 on a two - year deal under @entity60 , @entity1 could even attempt to match @entity27 's total achievement			2
but first his side must overcome @entity11 , who are the only unbeaten side in the competition this year			0
and they will have to do it for the first leg at least with a host of stars including @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , along with @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			0
@entity1 celebrates winning @entity89 's top club prize in his first season with @entity20 in 2005 @entity1 ( on the ground ) scored the equaliser for 3 - 3 against @entity69 before @entity20 won 3 - 2 on penalties @entity1 celebrates after @entity21 won the final with him suspended due to too many yellow cards @entity27 ( centre ) won four @entity7 with three clubs , including two with @entity69			1
