a former altar - boy - turned - vigilante who murdered a gay man he wrongly believed to be a paedophile was told today he may spend the rest of his life behind bars			1
@entity7 , 28 , battered supermarket worker @entity8 , 57 , over the head with a hammer just four months after being freed from jail following his acquittal for a vicar ’s murder			1
in a cold - blooded plan hatched in his prison cell , the ' self - appointed judge , jury and executioner ' made it his personal mission to rid the world of child molesters after he compiled a hit list of suspects , on which he put mr @entity8 at the top			0
hit - list : @entity7 , 28 , left , put @entity8 , 57 , right , at the top of a list of men he planned to kill because he suspected they were paedophiles , the court heard but a court earlier heard that he lured mr @entity8 to his death , despite there ‘ not being a shred of evidence ’ that he was a paedophile			1
he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years at @entity42 in south - east @entity43 today			1
hit list : this chilling piece of paper entitled ' tango priorities ' has the names and addressed of people @entity7 was intent on killing but the judge , mr @entity50 , warned he was an ' extremely dangerous man ' who ' may well kill again ' if released in the foreseeable future			1
the judge said : ' the time may never come when this defendant is considered safe to be released			0
' @entity7 previously spent more than nine years in jail for killing the @entity56 , 81 , in his bath and cutting up his body in april 2001			1
but his conviction was quashed and he was cleared of mr @entity56 ’s murder at a retrial during which he alleged that the priest sexually abused him			0
after being freed from prison in september 2010 , @entity7 , of @entity63 , @entity64 , made a ' hit list ' of men he planned to kill in his bid to rid the world of paedophiles			1
having formulated a plan to track down child abusers and rapists while he was in custody , on his release he set up false internet accounts as a ' honeytrap ' for sex offenders			1
mr @entity8 , an @entity79 employee from @entity80 , @entity64 , was at the top of @entity7 ’s list of targets , although the prosecution said there was ' not a shred of evidence ' that he was a paedophile			2
having split up from his long - term partner , the supermarket worker regularly used social networking and dating websites to meet young men for consensual sex , the trial heard			1
overnight on january 10 - 11 last year , @entity7 had sex with mr @entity8 at his flat before brutally smashing his head with five severe hammer blows and strangling him with a shoelace			1
claims : @entity7 , left , alleged that he was abused by @entity56 , right			2
@entity7 served eight years of a life sentence for the clergyman 's killing , but was later acquitted of his murder the killer tried to cover his tracks by sending text messages falsely suggesting that the supermarket worker believed he was meeting a 15 - year - old boy			1
mr @entity50 said @entity7 went to mr @entity8 ’s flat prepared to kill him , and carried out a ' planned and cold - blooded ' attack			2
he noted that the defendant had an ' intense hatred ' of paedophiles , having suffered abuse as a child			0
the judge said : ' he believes that the penalties handed out by the courts for child abuse are inadequate			0
' for him the appropriate penalty , if he considers it necessary , is death			0
he has appointed himself judge , jury and executioner			0
' however good the evidence of child abuse , the defendant was not entitled to take the law into his hands in the way he did but , as he demonstrated in this case , he was prepared to reach his conclusions on entirely inadequate evidence			0
' brutal : this was the contents of a green rucksack - including a knife , passport and road atlas - that killer @entity7 had with him while travelling in @entity8 's @entity142 car facing life : @entity7 , pictured handcuffed to security guards during his trial while held on remand , tried to leap from the dock to escape when he was found guilt of murder			2
@entity7 , who who has a bizarre tattoo covering his back , will be sentenced later mr @entity50 observed that @entity7 ’s hatred of paedophiles grew during his time in prison , where he might have come into contact with sex offenders who showed a lack of remorse for the harm they committed			1
he said : ' the evidence that i have heard has driven me to the conclusion that the defendant is now an extremely dangerous man who may well kill again were he to be released in the foreseeable future			0
' the parole board will undoubtedly take all that into account when deciding when , and if , this defendant should ever be released			0
' @entity171 , mitigating , said that while in prison @entity7 was forced to play the role of an abuse victim in therapy sessions organised for sex offenders			1
he was then freed after being acquitted of mr @entity56 ’s murder without being prepared for his release and with no authority responsible for supervising him in the community			0
caught : @entity7 was pictured driving murder victim @entity8 's @entity142 car immediately after the killing @entity7 , unshaven in a black and grey casual jacket , made no reaction as his sentence was passed , but mouthed a few words to family members in the public gallery as he was led away by court guards			2
following the case , detective chief inspector @entity190 of the @entity191 and @entity192 , said : ' this was a terrible crime , and the jury were clearly unconvinced by @entity7 ’s claims about his motives for carrying out such a cruel and deliberate killing			2
' @entity8 ’s sister , together with her husband , was present at court throughout the trial and they had to listen to @entity7 deliver utterly unfounded personal attacks about the character of her brother			0
' they endured this with great dignity and this is testimony to how they have conducted themselves since @entity8 was murdered			0
' what exactly was motivating @entity7 in the lead up to the murder and afterwards we will perhaps never really know , but there is no doubt at all that society is a safer place now that he is in prison			0
