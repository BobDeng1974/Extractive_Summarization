the lawyer representing one of four former @entity3 football players charged in a june 2013 campus rape , says his client was ' too drunk to rape ' or be held responsible for his actions			1
@entity3 tight end @entity8 , safety @entity9 , defensive @entity11 , and receiver @entity12 were suspended and indicted in september 2013 for allegedly raping a 21 - year - old female student and videotaping the assault			1
but now @entity8 's defense attorney says her client was too drunk to know what he was doing and would not have been able to perform such a sex act , the @entity15 reports			1
defense attorney for @entity8 ( pictured ) charged with raping a woman in a campus dorm in june 2013 has said he was so drunk that he was incapable of rape date night : on june 23 , @entity8 took a 21 - year - year woman out on a date to the @entity27 bar , after which she passed out @entity30 prosecutors says the theory is far - fetched and wants to put a stop to the alibi before it goes any further			1
a new court filing asks a judge to block a @entity37 - based psychologist from testifying about @entity8 's drunkenness on the night police say he took part in the rape of his unconscious 21 - year - old girlfriend in his dorm room			1
the psychologist 's report suggests that the idea @entity8 was so drunk as to be unaware of his surroundings but prosecutors say such an idea is ' purely speculative ' and not based on science			2
although the judge in the case has not ruled on whether to allow the ' evidence ' during the forthcoming trial , it is unlikely that drunkenness would be allowed to serve as an excuse for committing a crime			0
' intoxication is generally not a defense to prosecution of a crime , particularly when the defendant was ' voluntarily ' intoxicated , ' said @entity63 , a @entity64 criminal defense attorney and continuing legal education instructor to the @entity15			0
@entity63 said intoxication would n't help @entity8 clear himself of recklessness , which is one of several factors in prosecuting aggravated rape			2
crime scene : police say the star player brought his unconscious date to his second - floor room in the @entity77 dormitory , where he proceeded to rape her but his defense lawyer said he was far too drunk to do it freed : @entity8 was released from jail this in september 2013 k on $ 350,000 bond ' ( @entity85 ) can not later claim that they were ' so drunk ' that they were unaware of a substantial risk , ' he said			1
the psychologist 's report also provides a new account of what happened when @entity8 and the woman arrived at @entity92 after authorities said they were drinking at @entity95 bar			1
according to @entity97 video , a ' very intoxicated ' @entity8 drove the woman 's black @entity98 through an intersection without stopping and parked near a police vehicle			2
@entity8 bumped the woman 's head on the car door before seeking help from three other men to take her inside			2
he also hit his own head on an elevator and vomited in a bathroom , ' intoxicated to the extent that he could not have possessed the required culpable mental state to form intent to be held criminally responsible for the actions of the others that were in his room , ' wrote psychologist @entity118			0
the defense also wants to prevent the victim from testifying at trial			0
during the attack , @entity8 sent a picture to another player , @entity125 , which he deleted , prosecutors have said			2
@entity125 received an 11 - month , 29 - day suspended sentence after pleading guilty to criminal attempt to commit accessory after the fact			1
prosecutors say he attempted to cover up the rape			0
afterward , @entity125 sent a text to @entity8 saying he and the other players who had been there should delete the photos and videos they had taken			0
@entity125 said he was looking out for their interests according to an account given at a different hearing , deputy attorney general @entity139 said @entity8 took an unconscious fellow student to his dormitory in the early morning of june 23 , 2013			1
earlier appearance : the alleged rape is believed to have taken place in @entity8 's room , and the victim did not think he would have allowed anything bad to happen to her ( @entity8 seen here in october last year ) @entity9 ( left ) , @entity11 ( center ) and @entity12 ( right ) are the other players facing two counts each of aggravated sexual battery in connection to the june 2013 rape he was joined by three other dismissed players â€” @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity157			1
the student was sexually assaulted " by different individuals , " @entity139 had said			0
all four are charged with several counts of rape and have pleaded not guilty			0
they are free on bond			0
banks and @entity12 face separate trials			0
the case has become cantankerous with the defense and prosecution trading allegations of misconduct against one another			0
the trial begins for @entity8 and @entity9 on november 3rd			1
two other defendants , @entity11 and @entity173 , have their own separate their trials to come .			0

authorities say suspect @entity8 took 21 - year - old to a bar june 23 and then brought her unconscious to his door room
his lawyer now says he was far too drunk to know what he was doing , let alone commit an act of rape
prosecution wants such *testimony* thrown out of court when the trial begins next month
@entity9 , @entity11 and @entity12 were all suspended and indicted on rape charges
