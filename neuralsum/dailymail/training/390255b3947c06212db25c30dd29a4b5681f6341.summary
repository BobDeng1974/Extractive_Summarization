fight for life : @entity3 's mother @entity24 and her brother , @entity25 , pictured outside @entity26 last month but the lack of brain function and three weeks without proper nutrition have taken their toll , and doctors were struggling to reverse the deterioration of her body , he said			1
medical emergency : @entity3 was declared brain dead after a tonsil operation went wrong papers filed by the hospital for a now cancelled court case today , also showed that the body was showing serious signs of decay and only the ' illusion of life '			1

' right now we are just taking it one day at a time			2
we are happy where she is right now , that we were able to remove her safely from @entity16			2

' additional and more dramatic signs of the body 's deterioration will continue to manifest over time , regardless of any procedures and regardless of any heroic measures that any facility might attempt			1
