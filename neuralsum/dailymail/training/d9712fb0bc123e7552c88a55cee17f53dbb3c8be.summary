by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 12:40 am on 2nd december 2011 it ’s one way to guarantee a @entity4 – but as it requires a £ 20,000 investment and nine months of preparation , it might be easier just to jet off to @entity8			2
@entity9 has transformed his bungalow into a winter wonderland , complete with quarter of a mile of fake snow and 50,000 fairy lights which flash in time to his own radio channel			2
visitors to his cul - de - sac in @entity19 , @entity20 , are invited to tune in to his station , which plays 11 festive tracks on a loop while a @entity25 figurine in his garden moves to the beat of each song			1
mr @entity9 , 36 , who runs karaoke nights , begins preparations for each year ’s display in march			2
he said : ' walking into our street is quite magical at @entity4			2
some people say it makes them feel cold , it is very @entity54			2
‘ our bungalow has been nicknamed “ the house on christmas street ”			2
i think about it and plan it every single day of the year			2
‘ i am slightly wacky about @entity4 and i am constantly trying to think of ways i can make our display the biggest and best			0
’ mr @entity9 estimates that this year ’s display will add around £ 150 to his electricity bill – but the money thrown into the wishing well in his garden is given to charity			0
he has spent £ 20,000 collecting the illuminations since 1998 , when he started with two strings of lights in 1998			0
@entity69 : the display boasts penguins , polar bears , a ferris wheel and 400 metres of fake snow dashing through the snow : a horse and sleigh in the garden in @entity19 , @entity20 celebrities @entity79 , who played @entity81 in @entity82 , and @entity84 singer @entity83 visited the close for the big switch - on yesterday			1
mr @entity9 added : ' our street looks good in the day as well as at night			0
you can sit in your car and enjoy the music on your radio , or come out as we have speakers playing @entity25 tunes			0
' it really looks fantastic , i feel very proud of it this year			0
' more than 1,000 people turned out for the switch - on , held in aid of the @entity99 , and were each given a mince pie from a local bakery			1
a team from @entity103 also handed out free drinks			0
mr @entity9 has spent a staggering 264 hours synching his lights to his radio station and the @entity25 figure - as one minute of music takes eight hours to sequence			1
the @entity109 on christmas street : visitors flock to see the display , which will be on show from 1 december to 5 january he began putting up the decorations on october 24 , and his house and garden are covered with 400 metres of polyester wadding which looks like a blanket of snow			1
he was inspired to create a ' house on christmas street ' after visiting @entity121 in the @entity84 where homeowners deck out their properties with thousands of festive lights			1
he returned home with just two sets of lights and put them on his mother 's bungalow			0
the lights stopped working a few years later and he began stocking up on @entity133 - made decorations			1
a donation wishing well is left at the front of the display - which attracts up to 100 cars a night			1
mr @entity9 's radio station , @entity138 , is broadcast from a transmitter a few hundred yards from his home between 5pm and 9.30pm from december 1 until january 5			0
he said : ' i am absolutely thrilled by what we have created and it is worth every penny			0
' @entity146 appeared to be rather less filled with festive spirit than our merry bungalow owner			1
while @entity9 brings glad tidings to all his neighbours , the prime minister had kept the best tree on the block for himself			1
the bushy fir outside no 10 was laden with huge shining baubles and delicate blue lights , but the @entity159 evergreen in nearby @entity160 was looking decidedly crooked			0
sad tidings : the famous tree that appears annually in @entity163 's @entity160 looks crooked and plainly decorated festive joy : but @entity146 , joined by @entity166 badge holders and presenter @entity167 , has a beautiful fir over in @entity169 tourists in @entity163 were rather surprised to discover the traditional @entity159 tree looking extremely ragged			1
the tall , skinny centrepiece is decorated carelessly with vertical strips of harsh green lights and a stark bulb on the top			0
mr @entity146 turned on the lights on in @entity169 with presenter @entity167 and a group of young @entity166 gold badge holders - but the public in @entity160 were left out in the cold			1
it will be a real a disappointment for children who visit the @entity163 landmark in the hope of seeing the most impressive festive scene of the season			1
the @entity188 is the @entity189 of @entity191 's traditional @entity25 gift to the @entity192 as a token of thanks for @entity133 support during the years of occupation			0
perhaps our prime minister could demonstrate equal @entity25 spirit in his own country			0
austerity @entity133 : the sparse @entity160 tree has been dressed with little visible effort or love @entity25 cheer : the magnificent sight outside @entity206 is the perfect winter spectacle , with its tasteful colour scheme of silver and white watch the video			1

visitors to cul - de - sac can tune in and hear 11 festive *favourites*
but in @entity163 , @entity146 keeps the best tree for himself
