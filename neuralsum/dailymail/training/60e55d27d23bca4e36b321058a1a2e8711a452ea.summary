by @entity0 a cat who lived on a diet of roasted meats and jam doughnuts was forced to go on a health kick after ballooning to nearly two stones			2
@entity8 , from @entity9 , weighed more than 26lbs - around the size of a @entity11 - when his owner was warned he could die			1
the 15 - year - old 's owner had been feeding @entity8 roast ham , fresh prawns and entire roast chickens from supermarkets			1
who 's a big lad ! @entity8 , from @entity9 , weighed as much as a @entity11 and was at risk of developing diabetes after being fed an unhealthy diet of doughnuts and luxurious roasted meats			1
he soon grew so big that he could hardly move off the sofa and was at risk of developing diabetes			1
owner @entity28 was warned her cat could die if she carried on giving him such huge meals			1
she said : ' the weight was piling on him and when i noticed that his back legs were so thick i had to do something about it			0
' he would eat anything that he wanted and he would be very spoilt			0
' for instance , i would get him a roast chicken from the supermarket and he would eat that			0
' so i took him to the vets and i was told that he almost had diabetes and if i did n't control his diet i would lose him			0
' lazy : @entity8 , 15 , weighed two stones would spend his heavier days lounging on the sofa			2
he ate a diet of roast chicken , fresh prawns and doughnuts , which was given to him by his owner @entity28 @entity8 was put on a special diet of dried food and water			1
he has now lost half of his body fat and weighs around 14lbs			0
@entity61 , head veterinary nurse at @entity62 in @entity9 , where @entity8 was treated , said the cat is now much healthier			2
she said : ' he was the size of a king charles spaniel dog - they weigh about 12.5 kilograms - and that was n't good			0
so something had to be done otherwise @entity28 would have lost him			2
that 's better : @entity8 went on to lose more than 12lbs after being put on a special diet by @entity61 , head veterinary nurse at @entity62 @entity8 now weighs a more healthy 14lbs after his owner swapped roasted meats and doughnuts for a simpler diet of dried food and water ' this happens a lot because pet owners think that they can just give their pets any food or even some of their own food			1
' now , @entity8 is on a specially - formulated prescription diet which makes him feel fuller for longer			0
' he 's a got nice skin now and a nice coat of hair because of his diet			0

owner @entity28 also fed him roast beef , roast ham and fresh prawns
the cat , 15 , could not move from the sofa and risked developing diabetes
@entity8 has now lost more than one stone on a diet of dried food and water
