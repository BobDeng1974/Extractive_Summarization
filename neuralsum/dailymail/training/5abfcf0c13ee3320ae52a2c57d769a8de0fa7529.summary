' potentially highly dangerous ' @entity1 says all the authorities need to do to reduce the risk he poses to society is ' take away his stick '			1
@entity1 , now in his 60s , was jailed for life at @entity15 in 1992 for the murder of a young woman , and is currently a high security category a prisoner at @entity20 , near @entity21			1
yesterday he won the first stage of his publicly - funded legal fight to become a category b inmate - after he told @entity26 ’s @entity25 his broken leg reduces his risk to the public			0
the court heard @entity1 long ago served the 15 - year minimum term set on his life sentence , but is still seen as ' potentially highly dangerous ' because he has never admitted his crime			2
despite a prison panel recommending he be downgraded in april last year , the government ’s @entity35 , @entity37 , blocked the move , ordering he remain under the tightest security conditions			0
his decision stated : ' we are still no nearer to understanding the motivations behind his carefully planned act of violence against a young woman			0
' the director also noted that his offending history had also evidenced a propensity for violence			0
' @entity1 was jailed for life in 1992 for the murder of a young woman , and is currently a high security category a prisoner at @entity20 , near @entity21 but @entity55 , for @entity1 , told the @entity25 too little regard had been given to his reduced mobility , due to his broken leg , when deciding on his prison status			2
he said : ' if someone is dependent on a stick for their mobility and they are in pain , then that is a very significant matter when considering risk			0
he added : ' one way to manage mr @entity1 ’s risk is to take his stick away			1
' lawyers for the @entity35 conceded @entity1 is ' no spring chicken ' , but said there was no clear medical evidence to suggest his risk of reoffending was reduced			1
judge @entity78 ruled @entity1 ’s complaints ' arguable ' and granted him permission for a full judicial review of the decision not to downgrade him , which will be held later this year .			0
