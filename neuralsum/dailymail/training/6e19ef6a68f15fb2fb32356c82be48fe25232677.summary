' miss @entity7 , a former hairdresser who has three children , @entity29 , 16 , @entity30 , six and @entity31 , three , reached 24st after she turned to food for an emotional crutch after she lost a baby when she was 18 years old			1
she said : ' i turned to comfort eating and it got the point where i did n't know how to say no. ' having my first two children and experiencing the weight gain and cravings just made the situation worse			1
i could eat a multi-pack of crisps without even thinking about it			2
' by her late thirties , @entity7 was classed as clinically obese and started to experience mounting health problems @entity7 turned to food as a comfort after losing a baby when she was 18 and used to eat huge amounts of junk by her late thirties , miss @entity7 was officially classed as clinically obese and was starting to experience mounting health problems			1

even the gentlest movement would leave me gasping for breath			0
' i was n't unhappy with my build , but i was devastated every time i could n't join in with an activity the kids were doing			0
i felt guilty to see their disappointment			0
' @entity7 at her largest , when she was a size 24 at an appointment in the spring of 2008 , her doctor made it clear that unless she changed to her lifestyle , she would become seriously ill. miss @entity7 said : ' my gp said he was really worried - that i would need to start losing weight as a matter of urgency			1
he referred me to a consultant who recommended that i have a gastric bypass through @entity78 funding			1
' i knew it was a drastic step , but i 'd tried every diet under the sun without any success , so the idea of being able to make a lasting change was very appealing			0
' i thought of myself running around in the park with the children , and was drawn to the idea			2
' miss @entity7 asked advice from her mother @entity89 and her partner @entity90 , 40 , a painter and decorator			1
she said : ' my mum warned me to have a serious think about			2
she said she would prefer it if i did n't go through with it , because she knew it was a major operation which carried major risks			0
' @entity90 was unsure too			0
he 'd met and fallen in love with me when i was at my biggest , and was happy with the way i was			0
he said all he cared about was whether i was happy , so if i really wanted to do it , he would support me			0
' after weighing up her options , miss @entity7 went under the knife in april 2008			1
within two months she had lost 3st			0
she said : ' i could barely eat any food			1
whatever i did manage to swallow made my stomach turn			0
i felt sick all the time			0
' following the surgery @entity7 , pictured here during her weight loss , found the weight dropping off at great speed as she was barely able to eat at all and felt uncomfortable full all the time @entity7 , pictured here ( @entity112 ) with @entity30 , holding @entity31 , @entity29 and her partner @entity90 , says her dream of losing weight giving her more energy has been shattered and she more exhausted than ever after the surgery in the summer of 2010 miss @entity7 discovered that she was pregnant with her third child			1
she said : ' carrying a child having been through the operation was a huge challenge			0
@entity90 and i were ecstatic but it was a really tough pregnancy and i was sick morning , noon and night			0
' instead of being full of life i was tired all the time			0
i tried my best to carry on but it was extremely tough			0
' following the birth of @entity31 in april 2011 , miss @entity7 calculated that she had lost a huge 10st - and the weight loss showed no signs of slowing			1
as she settled into her new figure , miss @entity7 began to struggle with the permanent effects of the surgery			1
she said : ' all i could manage was the tiniest portions at dinner time			0
@entity90 was concerned - he thought there was no way i could eat as little as i was and still be healthy			2
' there were times when all i could manage was sucking on a ice - cube because i felt so unnaturally full			0
' my energy dipped to practically zero and simple pleasures , like spending time alone with @entity90 and chasing around after the children , became a huge chore			1
@entity7 says she has been left barely able to eat anything and has no energy to play with her children ( right , pictured with son , @entity31 ) ' i used to love having hot baths , but i had shrunk so much that lying in the bath became too uncomfortable as the enamel pressed against my spine			1
sitting on hard seats was excruciating			0
' now weighing just over 8st and having shrunk from size 24 to a tiny size 6 , miss @entity7 has found that she struggles to buy clothes which properly fit her			1
she said : ' i buy a few bags of ice cubes and eat a pint of them throughout the day			2
it 's the best compromise i can find to keep my mind off food , since most food makes me feel extremely nauseous			2
' i ca n't go out for meals with @entity90 any more and worst of all , my dream of being active with the children seems further away than ever			2
' doctors are currently reviewing miss @entity7 's situation and she is hopeful that she will one day find a solution to allow her to each proper meals again			1
she said : ' it 's important that people realise that gastric operations come with significant risk			2
my life has changed out of all recognition			0
' i completely regret having the gastric bypass			1
i wish i 'd never done it			0
it 's just such a shame that i had to get to this point to realise that i was happier when i was overweight			2

@entity7 turned to food as a comfort after losing a baby when she was 18
after the birth of her three children , her weight reached its *highest* of 24st
was warned by doctors her size was a danger to her health
having tried many diets , decided to take the @entity78 gastric bypass on offer
@entity7 's surgery saw her drop from size 24 and 24st to 8st and a size 6
however has left her barely able to eat anything and with no energy
wants other women to think carefully before going under the knife
