a history of @entity1 in maps - from @entity4 's birth to today - reveals the capital 's changing landscape over 450 years and how many were designed to show what the population ate or if they were ' vicious criminals ' rather than helping people find their way			1
the new exhibition , ' @entity12 ' , contains the oldest existing original map of @entity1 from 1572 , designed with bright colours and a boat - filled @entity16 to ' uplift the spirit ' of armchair travellers rather than help give directions			1
one from 1655 says it ' is a ready helpe or guide to direct @entity23 to finde the nearest way from one place to another ' and renamed streets like @entity28 in central @entity1 ' @entity29 ' because of its high density of pickpockets			1
in it @entity1 is depicted in birds - eye view from the south looking north			1
four figures in traditional @entity43 dress alongside @entity44 that says the capital is ' famed amongst many peoples for its commerce , adorned with houses and churches , distinguished by fortifications , famed for men of all arts and sciences , and lastly for its wealth in all things ' 1799 : @entity58 's map was produced for use by the @entity60 , an insurance firm			2
it was the largest map ever printed in @entity62 at the time , and the first attempt to produce a map of @entity1 with all of the houses delineated and numbered			1
it was plotted to show which buildings had the greatest fire risk 1922 : @entity71 's large @entity70 says : ' in the heat of the summer we will find me cool , in the cool of the winter will find me warm , come down underground you 've bought you your ticket ? your health man i 'm thinking no longer twill stick it			2
for cheapness , celerity what else can compare			0
you are fed up above , feed below on our fare '			0
the coats of arms are of the eight principal @entity88 and a rabbit for @entity90 , which he joke was the oldest tube inhabitant 2012 : for this work @entity93 has painstakingly charted the buried rivers , tube lines , bunkers , sewers , government tunnels and other subterranean secrets of @entity1			2
the work also includes mysterious and underworld elements , such as unsolved murders , ley lines and pagan burial sites in 1719 one map says @entity1 has 5,000 streets , 110,000 houses and the population is guessed at ' by what is eaten ' by almost 700,000 ' souls '			1
a 1799 masterpiece drawn by @entity58 was the final attempt to map every building in @entity1			1
it was paid for by insurers who wanted to know which homes and businesses were near candle makers or tanneries so they could increase premiums because of the fire threat			2
an 1899 map is coloured by by street and its key says : ' @entity127			2
vicious , semi-criminal ' ( black ) ; ' very poor , casual			0
@entity129 ' ( blue ) ; ' poor			0
18s to 21s a week for a moderate family ' ( light blue ) ; ' mixed			0
some comfortable , others poor ' ( purple ) ; ' fairly comfortable			0
good ordinary earnings ' ( pink ) ; ' well - to - do			2
middle class ' ( red ) ; ' upper - middle and @entity141 classes			0
wealthy ' ( yellow )			0
at the centre of all the maps is the @entity16 , whose snaking path proved incredibly difficult to plot accurately and is different on every one of the older exhibits			0
' mapping @entity1 ' is part of the @entity149 and also has spectacular maps from the present day , including @entity151 ' , showing the sewers , tubes , underground rivers and burial grounds that lie under the city			1
the exhibition is curated by @entity162 , one of the world 's leading specialist map dealers , who also owns the first map of the @entity166 , the world 's first colour atlas printed in colour and the first map ever printed , from 1475			2
he found fame in 2007 after he sold an atlas in his collection for Â£ 2.1million and days later sold a map for $ 1million			0
1655 : @entity171 named this : ' the @entity173 and @entity174 of the most @entity1 and @entity175 with their suburbs ' , and said it was designed to ' helpe or guide to direct @entity23 to finde the nearest way from one place to another ' 1746 : considered one of the finest maps of - what is now - @entity185 @entity184 , a @entity186 huguenot who emigrated with the rest of his family to @entity1 in the 1730s , took nine years to produce it and had it engraved upon 24 sheets of copper before it could be published in 1746 1812 : @entity194 and @entity196 's map features the new and grand building and bridges of @entity1 , including the new docks of east @entity1 where @entity200 now stands			1
areas due for development like @entity203 are coloured but blank as they were being built 1827 : @entity205 and @entity206 's map is considered to be of @entity208 standard			0
it is scaled at 8ins per mile and has detailed depictions of streets , houses , public buildings , parks , squares , woods , plantations , rivers , hills , windmills and boundaries			0
below the plan is a dedication to @entity224 , which is flanked by views of @entity226 and @entity227 1843 : @entity228 ( 1796 - 1880 ) was a publisher of ; some of the clearest and most attractive @entity1 maps '			1
this shows the expanding @entity1 and extends north to south from @entity231 to @entity232 , and west to east from @entity233 to @entity234			1
@entity228 would re-issue the plan several times for the following 20 years , each time updating it with the latest additions			0
mapping @entity1 is free and runs until sunday at the @entity238 on @entity1 's @entity239 .			1
