by @entity0 published : 10:00 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 20 april 2013 controversial scientist dr @entity1 has issued his direst warning yet for humanity as he quit his job at @entity5 to concentrate on raising awareness of climate change			1
@entity1 wrote that he decided to step down ' so that i can spend full time on science , drawing attention to the implications for young people , and making clear what science says needs to be done			0
' he also published a paper outlining what he calls ' @entity17 syndrome ' - where global warming becomes so bad @entity19 can no longer sustain human life			1
dr @entity1 and a climate change day of action : he has warned a failure to deal with climate change could result in the planet being not only ice - free but human - free ' a mini-runaway is an event fed by feedback loops - like melting permafrost			1
as ocean and air temps rise , more methane - rich material like permafrost and hydrates melt			2
methane traps more heat than carbon , and speeds the warming			2
this amplification effect means drastic warming can be triggered much faster than current models predict , some scientists claim			2
' it it is not an exaggeration to suggest , based on best available scientific evidence , that burning all fossil fuels could result in the planet being not only ice - free but human - free , ' he claims			2
' if we burn all the fossil fuels it is certain that sea level would eventually rise by tens of meters , ' he claims			0
' the only argument is how soon the rise of several meters needed to destroy habitability of all coastal cities would occur			0
' it is also possible that burning all fossil fuels would eventually set off a hyperthermal event , a mini-runaway			0
' according to the paper , which @entity1 posted on the @entity68 website , the ' runaway ' could cause @entity19 to become like @entity17			1
according to a new paper which @entity1 posted on the @entity68 website , the ' runaway ' effect of climate change could cause @entity19 to become like @entity17 ' @entity19 can ' achieve ' @entity17 - like conditions , in the sense of ~ 90 bar surface pressure , only after first getting rid of its ocean via escape of hydrogen to space , ' he writes			1
' this is conceivable if the atmosphere warms enough that the troposphere expands into the present stratosphere			0
' according to the @entity84 , @entity1 will step down from his $ 180,000 a year position to join a number of lawsuits challenging the federal and state governments for their failure to police industry over man ’s effect on the climate , the @entity84 reported			0
' as a government employee , you ca n’t testify against the government , ' he said			0
@entity17 is the second planet from the @entity99 , orbiting it every 224.7 @entity19 days @entity17 is the second planet from the @entity99 , orbiting it every 224.7 @entity19 days			1
@entity17 is classified as a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called @entity19 's ' sister planet ' owing to their similar size , gravity , and bulk composition			1
however , conditions there are very different			0
@entity17 today has a surface pressure of about 90 bars , compared with 1 bar on @entity19			1
the @entity17 atmosphere is mostly @entity112			2
the huge atmospheric depth and @entity112 amount are the reason @entity17 has a surface temperature of nearly 500 ° @entity117 @entity17 and @entity19 probably had similar early atmospheric compositions , but on @entity19 the carbon is mostly in @entity19 's crust			1
the planet is named after the @entity123 goddess of love and beauty			0
after the @entity127 , it is the brightest natural object in the night sky .			0

leading scientists has stood down from his job as @entity5 to concentrate on campaigning
