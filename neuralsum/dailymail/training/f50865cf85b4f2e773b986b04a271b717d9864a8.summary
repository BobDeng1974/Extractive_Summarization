@entity3 left his position as the @entity6 's director general to take up the role of the @entity5 company 's chief executive , but now a police inquiry into the accusations could force him to answer tough questions as he begins the job in november			1
in a case that has been referred to as ' @entity11 's @entity29 ' , a group of alleged victims - some as young as 13 - have claimed that late tv host @entity32 abused them over six decades - during which time he was employed by the broadcaster			1
@entity32 was the eccentric host for @entity6 favourites , including @entity37 'll fix it , where he granted children 's wishes over its 20 - year run , and @entity42 , a popular chart music show that aired for more than four decades			1
@entity32 , who was knighted in 1990 , died last year at the age of 84 after a visit to hospital with pneumonia			0
now , scores of men and women have stepped forward to claim he abused them when they were young after rival broadcaster @entity54 reported on the allegations earlier this month			2
much of @entity32 's career involved working with children , including visiting schools and hospital wards , and many of his victims have claimed he seized these opportunities to molest them			1
the @entity63 in @entity64 has confirmed they are investigating 40 cases involving incidents across the country dating back to 1959 , yet they have received a total of 340 lines of inquiry			2

some of the alleged abuse is believed to have taken place on the @entity6 premises			2
on sunday , @entity5 ' former executive editor @entity92 wrote a column drawing a parallel between @entity95 and @entity97 football coach @entity96 , sentenced to life in jail for molesting children			2
' whether the @entity6 fell short in its reporting and missed the story or had the story and lacked the nerve , it is a significant embarrassment , compounded by the hard question of why the widespread rumors of @entity32 's behavior were ignored for so long , ' @entity92 wrote			1
the allegations mean that @entity3 , who joined the @entity6 as a trainee in 1979 , will not be able to leave the job behind just yet , as he may become embroiled in the police and parliamentary inquiries			1
scandal : the case has been likened to that of former @entity97 football coach , @entity96 , who has been jailed for the rest of his life for sexually abusing children			0
colleagues failed to report the abuse @entity3 quickly rose up the ranks at the broadcaster , working on shows such @entity126 , a nightly current affairs program known for its analysis and examinations of the country 's politicians			1
in fact , @entity126 had worked on its own investigation into the @entity72 allegations in december last year but cancelled it , leading to accusations of a cover up			0
the @entity6 has denied this and is currently investigating the matter and cooperating with police			1
@entity126 's editor , @entity141 , said they had shelved the program after public prosecutors dropped their case due to a lack of evidence			0
an article in the @entity5 on saturday noted @entity3 was at the top job at the @entity6 when the @entity126 investigation was dropped			1
@entity3 , 55 , said in a statement : ' i was not notified or briefed about the @entity126 investigation , nor was i involved in any way in the decision not to complete and air the investigation			0

some incidents allegedly took place on @entity6 premises earlier this month , @entity54 , a rival network to the @entity6 , aired a documentary , exposure : @entity169 of @entity32			2
on the program , which was researched by a former police detective , several women claimed they had been molested by the long - serving tv host after he obtained access to them through his shows and charity work			1
ex-bbc staff said bosses had ' turned a blind eye ' to his behaviour and that it had been an ' open secret '			0
a revered advocate of child protective services , @entity181 , said she had heard rumours that he was inappropriate with children			0
and one @entity6 radio boss , @entity186 , called for an investigation into the allegations in 1973 as he feared them coming out in the press - but did not make full inquiries as ' he felt they lacked weight '			0
it also emerged that current affairs program @entity126 had planned to air an investigative report into the allegations in december 2011 , but later dropped it			0
bosses denied a cover up , instead insisting they shelved the program after public prosecutors dropped their case due to a lack of evidence			0

@entity32 , who died last year aged 84 , was interviewed by police in his lifetime but investigations were dropped due to lack of evidence			0
' i have no reason to doubt the public statement by the program 's editor , @entity141 , that the decision not to pursue the investigation was entirely his , and that it was made solely for journalistic reasons			0
' during my time as director general of the @entity6 , i never heard any allegations or received any complaints about @entity32			1
' there is no evidence to suggest that @entity3 knew about the decision to axe the program or about @entity32 's alleged behaviour			1
colleagues insist he had nothing to do with the editorial process of @entity126			0
' the chances that @entity3 interfered in the decisions of @entity126 as to whether or not they were going to broadcast the story are precisely zero , ' said @entity244 , a long - time colleague at the @entity6			2
in the years when their careers overlapped , @entity3 was in the news and current affairs area of the company rather than in its entertainment arm where @entity32 worked until retiring in 1994			2
@entity251 , who took over as director general from @entity3 , said the allegations have ' truly shocked ' him			1
he added : ' if there are lessons we can learn then we must do so to ensure that the mistakes of the past should never be repeated			0
' a representative for the @entity5 would not comment on the @entity6 investigations			2
yet the situation is far from ideal for @entity3 or the @entity5 , @entity262 , a senior faculty member for ethics at the @entity264 , a journalism school and media think tank , told @entity2			2
' it really depends what else comes out and how closely he can be tied to the scandal at the @entity6 , ' said @entity262			0
' if it 's just guilt by association most of the time organizations are fine with that			0
' @entity3 was named ceo of the @entity5 in august , capping an eight - month search for an executive to lead the company after chief executive @entity279 was abruptly ousted last year			2
he was hired by the @entity5 in part because of his extensive experience in video and digital , and because of his skills in corporate diplomacy			0
shaky start : @entity3 was named as ceo of the @entity5 company in august and starts in november while at the @entity6 , @entity3 helped develop the digital @entity290 , which enables viewers to catch up on missed programs online for free			1
it was considered a huge hit among those viewing the @entity295			0
he has been lauded for guiding the public broadcaster through morale problems , assaults from @entity298 's media empire and threats to its funding by the @entity11 government			1
indeed , @entity304 chairman @entity298 , whose own company 's @entity11 phone - hacking scandal has been covered extensively by both the @entity6 and the @entity5 , seized on the opportunity to jab at his rivals on @entity309			1
' look to new ceo to shake up @entity5 unless recalled to @entity6 to explain latest scandal , ' @entity298 tweeted .			1
