learner drivers ’ chances of passing their test vary widely depending on where they live , official figures show			1
barely a quarter of women and a third of men pass their test in inner city areas like @entity11			1
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			0
but more than three quarters of drivers in rural areas get to tear up their l plates after being given the thumbs up by their examiner , in part because they learn drive in fields before they even turn 17			1
last year it was announced the driving test could be overhauled , with the three - point turn test scrapped altogether and replaced with parking manoeuvres			2
learners could be asked to follow directions on a satnav as part of a radically revised practical exam designed to reflect ‘ real - world ’ conditions			0
according to latest figures around half of men pass their test compared to around 43 per cent of women			1
however there are dramatic differences between test centres in different parts of the country			2
people living in more affluent areas are likely to be able to afford more lessons before putting in for their test			1
those who grew up in the countryside are likely to hone their skills steering a car in the drive or practising clutch skills in a field , long before they turn 17			0
pass rates are lower in inner city urban areas , where there are fewer opportunities to practise safely			1
it is a brave parent who would venture into a city centre with a learner driver at the wheel , especially as they are unlikely to drive very often themselves			2
for women , the pass rate in 2013 - 14 was highest in @entity27 , in the @entity79 at 77 per cent			1
the top 10 areas include the @entity81 , @entity82 in the @entity83 and @entity84 in @entity85 in @entity86			0
but contrast , the lowest pass rates were mostly in urban areas , the lowest at the @entity29 test centre in @entity11 , where just 27.4 per cent got their licence			1
four of the 10 lowest pass rates were in @entity13 , and other areas include @entity14 , @entity94 in @entity95 and the market town of @entity97 in the @entity98			1
men taking their tests had a higher pass rate on @entity102 in the @entity103 and lowest in @entity104 in south east @entity13 the driving test was introduced on march 13 , 1935 , when were only 1.5 million registered vehicles			1
the year before the compulsory test was brought in , there were 7,000 people were killed as a result of road accidents			2
since its inception , the test has been adapted to reflect advances in car design and changing road layout			0
hand signals were removed in 1975 and a video hazard perception test introduced in 2002			0
since 1996 , drivers have to pass the written @entity120 before they are able to take the practical driving test			2
two " show me " " @entity123 " questions involving vehicle safety were introduced at the beginning of the practical test in september 2003			2
the @entity128 conducted 1.5 million driving tests in 2013 - 14			0
just under half of people ( 47.1 per cent ) passed their test last year there is a similar pattern for men , who had the highest pass rate on the island of @entity102 in the @entity138 ( 82.6 per cent )			1
test centres in @entity140 including @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 also had high pass rates			1
once again , many of the lowest pass rates were in @entity13 and the @entity147 , including @entity148 ( 36.1 per cent ) , @entity149 ( 40.8 per cent ) , @entity150 ( 36.7 per cent ) and @entity151 ( 39.4 per cent )			1
some test centres with low pass rates are in areas with high levels of immigration			1
since last year all driving tests have to be carried out in @entity158 or @entity140 , following concerns about fraud involving interpreters			0
it followed the case of @entity164 , who was jailed after selling answers to the written test in @entity167 to 94 people			0
@entity169 , general manager of the @entity170 , said : ‘ the more rural a test centre is , they tend to have a higher pass rates because people in those areas find cheaper insurance , there are more vehicles around , mum and dad are used to taking them out on journeys			1
‘ people in rural communities tend to be more experienced			0
an awful lot of them have learnt the skills driving around a field			0
‘ if you live in an inner city area , it is more expensive to put young people on insurance and you never drive very far			1
‘ areas like @entity151 have a high degree of immigration , @entity158 is not their first language			0
they have to do the test in @entity158 so that can be a problem			0
’ he stressed that the variations were the result of differing abilities between those being tested			0
‘ we are very happy with the consistency of the results across the country			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity208 said : ‘ pass rates can be influenced by various factors			2
some people take more lessons and are better prepared for the test			2
statistical factors can also play a part as the number of tests conducted at different test centres varies significantly			0
‘ we train examiners to a high standard and closely monitor their work to ensure that all tests are assessed consistently across the country			0

half of men and 43 ***%*** of women pass their test each year , figures show
but pass rates vary between 77 ***%*** and 27 ***%*** in different areas of the country
women *'s* pass rates highest in @entity27 and lowest in @entity11
men most likely to pass in @entity103 and least likely in @entity149
experts say people in rural areas get chance to learn to drive in fields
driving lessons can also be more expensive in inner city areas
