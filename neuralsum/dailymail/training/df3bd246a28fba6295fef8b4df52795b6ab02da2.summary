by @entity0 published : 17:11 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 17:59 est , 15 january 2014 @entity2 has been told either she or her landlord must pay to have the 50ft tree removed it is a scene that was all too familiar at the height of the recent storms			1
the trouble is , this fallen tree is still there three weeks after it was felled by 60mph winds ... while neighbours continue to argue over who is responsible for its costly removal			1
the 50ft leylandii , planted in a back garden , was already causing problems by overshadowing a next door flat in @entity20 , @entity21			2
then , on christmas eve , matters came to a head when it crashed down on the roof and rear wall of the neighbouring property – cutting off all the light from several windows and rendering its garden virtually impassable			2
now @entity2 , who lives in the stricken flat , has been told that either she or her landlord , and not the owner of the garden in which the tree is still partly rooted , must pay £ 2,500 to have it removed			1
in the meantime , the giant leylandii has been left lying at a 40 degree angle against her block			0
the 35 - year - old support worker was in her kitchen when she heard an enormous crash at the back door as the tree toppled			1
she said her landlord ’s insurance firm had suggested he could pay the bill , which could then be claimed back from the leylandii owner ’s insurance company			1
however , her landlord has refused to pay on the grounds that it is not his tree – leaving her saddled with the damage			1
‘ it ’s a nightmare , ’ miss @entity2 said yesterday			2
‘ bits of bricks are falling off and landing in my garden and the branches are getting droopy and falling off			0
‘ there is water running down inside the loft space too			0
‘ it ’s getting more dangerous the longer it is left there			0
the owner says as it is now on my land , it is my responsibility to get it moved			0
‘ but surely if you own something and it breaks or damages someone else ’s property it ’s the owner ’s responsibility to fix it ? ’ she added : ‘ my landlord ’s insurance company has said that he will foot the bill and they will try to reclaim it from the tree owner ’s insurance firm			1
‘ but that means he must first pay up out of his own pocket , and that ’s where the problem lies			0
i think the tree owner should be responsible for removing it			1
‘ i ’m in a stalemate now because my landlord is refusing to pay for it because it ’s not his tree , which i understand			1
stalemate : ms @entity2 will not now how much damage the tree has caused to her home until it is removed ‘ it should n’t be down to the innocent party to clear up someone else ’s mess			2
’ miss @entity2 said that she will not know how much damage has been done to her home until the tree is taken away			2
@entity105 , 61 , who owns the garden where the leylandii once stood upright , said : ‘ it is not our responsibility because it is in their property			0
‘ i have spoken to our insurance company multiple times about it			0
‘ their insurance company has to get it removed and then they can recover the costs			0
‘ i do n’t want this dragging on and i appreciate @entity2 ’s point of view			0
