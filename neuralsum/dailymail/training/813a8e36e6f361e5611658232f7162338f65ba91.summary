@entity0 has developed a computer chip which it says will function like a human brain in a giant step forward for artificial intelligence			1
@entity5 is being hailed as the world ’s first neurosynaptic computer chip because it can figure things out on its own			1
the chip also has one million ‘ neurons ’ and could cram the same power as a super computer into a circuit the size of a postage stamp			1
@entity0 's @entity5 processor could enable a wide variety of applications based on the human brain 's computing power			1
for instance , it could help assist vision - impaired people to navigate through an environment experts said that it was as big an advance as the advent of supercomputers in the 1980			0
@entity29 , deputy director of the @entity30 , told the @entity31 : ‘ it is a remarkable achievement in terms of scalability and low power consumption ’			2
modern processors have some 1.4 billion transistors and consume up to 140 watts but the @entity0 chip contains 5.4 billion transistors and uses just 70 milliwatts of power , meaning it is incredibly efficient			1
@entity5 will use closely interconnected ‘ neurons ’ just like the brain does meaning that it can work proactively to a level not seen before			1
in addition to the one million ‘ neurons ’ it has 256 million programmable synapses , the most @entity0 has ever put in a chip			1
the chip has one million ‘ neurons ’ and could cram the same power as a super computer into a circuit the size of a postage stamp			2
it also has 256 million programmable synapses , the most @entity0 has ever put in a chip the human brain has 100 billion neurons and up to 150 trillion synapses but @entity0 principal investigator and senior manager @entity58 told @entity61 that it could still perform a wide variety of tasks			0

he said that @entity5 could be used to monitor oil spills or issue tsunami alerts on its own without the need for a human to keep track of things			0
@entity82 , the research director of tech research firm @entity83 , said that @entity0 's chip was a ‘ really big deal ’			1
he said that if a robot today was walking towards a pillar then it needed a huge amount of computing to stop it heading into it			0
but a robot using @entity5 would be able to sense it and change direction just as a human can			0
computers are now approaching the stage where they are considered ‘ smarter ’ than humans in many ways			0
earlier this year a computer programme passed the @entity101 for the first time , which is seen as a milestone in artificial technology			0
the programme , which mimicked a 13 - year - old boy , was mistaken for a human more than 40 per cent of the time during a series of five - minute keyboard conversations with a real person			0
films like @entity111 have played on our fears about such technology - in the classic sci - fi thriller a computer system becomes self aware and launches nuclear strikes in an attempt to wipe out humanity , leading to a war between man and machines			0
ironically @entity0 ’s cognitive computing programme is called @entity125 , which is similar to @entity126 , the computer system in @entity111			2
