by @entity1 reporter published : 08:14 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 10:04 est , 12 september 2013 a @entity3 zoo where a two - year - old boy died after being mauled in a wild @entity6 dogs exhibit has accused the toddler 's mom of being at fault for the tragic death			1
@entity11 died on nov. 4 when he fell over a 4 - foot - tall railing into the exhibit after his mom had lifted him up to get a better look			1
the @entity17 has accused mom @entity18 of negligence in a claim filed on monday in response to a lawsuit brought by her and husband @entity24 seeking unspecified damages from the zoo for their son 's death			1
the parents ' attorney , @entity46 , said in a statement on wednesday that ' the zoo 's position is dead wrong and shameful			1
' @entity52 district attorney @entity51 had determined in november that @entity18 would n't be prosecuted and that @entity11 's death was a ' tragic accident			1
' @entity51 said the boy had vision problems and wore glasses , and that 's partly why his mother had lifted him onto a railing to view the pack of dogs			1
desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as they savagely attacked the two - year - old ( file image ) the wild dogs attacked the child so quickly at the zoo exhibit that by the time a veterinarian and other zoo staffers had arrived it would have been futile to try to rescue the boy @entity51 said witnesses described the boy lunging forward , as if he thought there was some sort of clear barrier to stop him			1
the boy fell and the animals immediately pounced on the child , who bled to death			1
witnesses say he had ' no chance ' of surviving after falling 11 - feet into the pit while his horrified parents looked on helpless			1
desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as they savagely attacked the two - year - old			2
@entity87 , ceo and president of the @entity17 and @entity17 said there is a net below the rail , but the boy bounced off it and into the enclosure			1
at rest : at @entity11 's funeral his parents asked friends , relatives and other mourners to donate toy construction trucks in the boy 's name , to be given to a children 's charity the @entity6 wild dog is an endangered species which typically roams the open plains and sparse woodlands of @entity111			1
the dog 's latin name @entity112 means ' painted wolf ' because of the animal 's patchy colored coat of red , black , brown , white and yellow fur , each with their own unique pattern			2
these dogs are very social , and packs have been known to share food and to assist weak or ill members			0
in fact after a successful hunt , the dogs regurgitate meat for those that remained at the den. they hunt in packs of six to 20 and despite their small size they prey on large animals like antelopes and wildebeests			0
they kill the larger prey by disemboweling , a technique that is rapid but has caused this species to have a negative , ferocious reputation			0
they are often hunted and killed by farmers who fear for their domestic animals and are susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals			0
its large teeth allow it to consume a lot of bone in the same way a hyena does and it has a bite force quotient - @entity157 , the strength of bite relative to the animal 's mass - measured at 142 , the highest of any carnivore , except for the @entity161			2
they are extremely aggressive and nearly 80 per cent of their hunts end in a kill - as opposed to a lion with a success rate of just 30 percent			2
there were once approximately 500,000 @entity6 wild dogs in 39 countries , and packs of 100 or more were not uncommon			0
now there are only about 3,000 - 5,500 in fewer than 25 countries			2
she said the animals attacked the child so quickly that by the time a veterinarian and other zoo staffers arrived seconds later , they determined it would have been futile to try to rescue the child			0
authorities said that zoo staff and then police responded ' within minutes ' but visitors described that time as being filled with screams for help			0
zookeepers called off some of the dogs , and seven of them immediately went to a back building			0
three more eventually were drawn away from the child , but one especially aggressive dog refused to back down and stop attacking the boy			2
it was shot dead by an officer			0
the other dogs were put in quarantine , not euthanized			0
the family 's neighbor @entity198 told the @entity200 : ' ( @entity24 and @entity18 ) went nowhere without @entity11			1
i can not imagine the dark cloud that is following them			0
' ' i ca nâ€™t imagine as a mom myself what tragedy that would be , your heart stops when your kid skins a knee			0
' she said her father saw @entity11 trick - or - treating in a @entity215 costume , and he could often be found playing on a swing set with his cousin , who lives nearby			1
' the hardest part is going to be to explain to my kids that their playmate is no longer here			0
his life will be celebrated			0
' experts said the death is highly unusual			0
@entity224 , a spokesman for the @entity225 , said no one he 's spoken to can recall any deaths of children at an accredited zoo over the last 40 years or more			2
@entity224 said the @entity17 successfully completed its five - year review in september , which means it meets or exceeds all safety standards			1
zoo president @entity87 told @entity232 that when the tragedy happened the zoo was fully staffed , including security			0
@entity17 had successfully completed a five - year review two months before the tragic incident , which means it met or exceeded all safety standards			1

@entity11 died on nov. 4 after falling over a 4 - foot - tall railing into the exhibit after his mom had lifted him up to get a better look
