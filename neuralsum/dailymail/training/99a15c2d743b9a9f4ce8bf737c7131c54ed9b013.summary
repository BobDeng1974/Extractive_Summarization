by @entity0 published : 09:43 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 03:31 est , 29 april 2013 the world 's smallest known winged insect , @entity3 , which has a body length of only 155 micrometres it may not be as common as the @entity7 fairy , but this newly discovered insect is the real @entity9			1
the fairyfly species named @entity11 was discovered in the forests of @entity13			1
the miniscule specimens were all just 250 micrometres long - or one quarter of a millimetre - and collected by sweeping the forest floor			1
tinkerbella nana was collected at the @entity18 and named as the newest fairyfly species			1
when viewed under a microscope , @entity11 nana 's long thin wings become visible			1
each is fringed with long hair - like bristles			1
@entity25 , commonly known as fairyflies , are one of about 18 families of chalcid wasps			1
they are found across the world , except in @entity31 , but are so minute that they are seldomly noticed by humans			0
their apparent invisibility and delicate wings with long fringes resembling the mythical fairies have earned them their common name			2
@entity25 species include the world 's smallest known winged insect , @entity3 , which has a body length of only 155 micrometres			2
the smallest known adult insect is also a fairyfly			0
the wingless male of @entity48 is only 130 micrometres			2
fairyflies live off the eggs and larvae of other insects			1
the eggs are commonly laid in concealed locations , such as in plant tissues or in leaf litter or soil			0
they are so small and difficult to find that most of the host insects of fairyflies are unknown			1
the newly discovered species were found in the young forests of @entity13 the @entity18 has a fairy - like quality befitting of an insect names @entity11 there are 1,424 known species of fairyflies spread across the world			1
at least five are aquatic and live in freshwater ponds and streams			0
one , called @entity72 , uses its wings as paddles to swim along and remain underwater for up to 15 days			0
the minute insects can survive in all kinds of habitats , from deserts to rainforests			2
they were first categorised in 1833 by the @entity84 entomologist @entity83			0
several species have been used for pest control , as fairyflies are valued for their ability to find the eggs of their hosts			2
@entity92 , from @entity93 , was the lead author of @entity94 , @entity11 published in the @entity95			1
he said : ' if something is physically possible in living things , some individuals of at least one species , extinct or extant , will likely have achieved it			0
' so the lower size limit , by whatever measure of size is chosen , was almost certainly already evolved â€” somewhere , sometime			0
' if we have not already found them , we must surely be close to discovering the smallest insects and other arthropods			2
' the @entity11 species were collected at the biological station owned and managed by the @entity110			1
@entity111 is known about the lifecycle of fairyflies			0
they have smaller wing surfaces and relatively long setae - or bristles - are believed to have an aerodynamic function			0
it may be to reduce turbulence on wings flapping at several hundred beats per second			0
the new fairyfly species shares a name with @entity7 's famous friend @entity9			0

the specimens of @entity11 nana were discovered in @entity13
the miniscule fairyflies are just 250 micrometres long
*scientists* say they do not know how small insects can be
