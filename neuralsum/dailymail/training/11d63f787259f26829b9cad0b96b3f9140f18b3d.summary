the temperature of @entity2 's surface has increased by only 0.06 ° c in the past 15 years - a fact that contradicts global warming climate models			1
this so - called ' pause ' has been used by some groups as evidence that climate change is not taking place			2
now a new study suggests that the discrepancy between the models and reality is all down to random fluctuations in the @entity2 's climate – and that the long - term trend still points to severe warming			1
the solid black line is the global mean surface temperature			0
the dashed black line is the average for this data on surface temperatures			0
the blue and red lines are linear trends for each 15 - year period from 1840			1
the researchers claim to have shown that these 15 - year trends are dominated by natural variations in the climate researchers at @entity32 in @entity33 and @entity34 in the @entity35 say the models do not overestimate man - made climate change			1
they claim global warming is ' highly likely ' to reach critical proportions by the end of the century - if the global community does not finally get to grips with the problem			2
' the claim that climate models systematically overestimate global warming caused by rising greenhouse gas concentrations is wrong , ' says @entity48 from the @entity32			1
the apparent mismatch between observed temperature increases and predictions from climate change models has led to some to claim that global warming has stalled , as seen by the black line in the graph above the global average temperature has risen only slightly since 1998 – which is surprising , considering scientific climate models predicted considerable warming due to rising greenhouse gas emissions			1
some people used this apparent contradiction to question climate change per se – or at least the harm potential caused by greenhouse gases – as well as the validity of the climate models			2
meanwhile , the majority of climate researchers continued to emphasise that the short - term ‘ warming hiatus ’ could largely be explained on the basis of current scientific understanding and did not contradict longer term warming			1
recently , researchers have been looking into the possible causes of the warming hiatus over the past few years			2
in a separate study , @entity75 recently concluded that two important factors are equally responsible for the hiatus			0
one of the important reasons is natural climate fluctuations , of which the weather phenomena @entity83 and @entity84 in the @entity85 are the most important , they claim			0
according to the study , the second important reason for the warming hiatus is that radiation from the sun has been weaker than predicted in the past few years			1
' climate sceptics often make precisely this claim , citing the warming pause as evidence			2
' yet they can not deny that nine of the ten warmest years since systematic climate observations began have occurred in the new millennium and that global warming has slowed at a very high level			1
' the sceptics also ignore the fact that ocean temperatures continue to rise as rapidly as many models have predicted			1
' on the whole , the simulated trends agreed well with the observations ' to explain the discrepancy between model simulations and observations , professor @entity48 and @entity109 compared simulated and observed temperature trends over all 15 - year periods since the start of the 20th century			1
for each year between 1900 and 2012 they looked at the temperature trend that each of the 114 available models predicted for the subsequent 15 years			1
they then compared the results with measurements of how the temperature actually rose or fell			0
by simulating the average global temperature and other climatic variables of the past and comparing the results with observations , they were able to check the reliability of their models			0
the 114 model calculations withstood the comparison			0
' on the whole , the simulated trends agree with the observations , ' said professor @entity48			0
' the most pessimistic and most optimistic predictions of warming in the 15 subsequent years for each given year usually differed by around 0.3 degrees @entity139			1
climate models , such as the one above , predict a significant increase in temperature by the end of this century , especially at the @entity2 's poles			2
no model , however , has predicted the global warming hiatus which climate researchers have observed since the turn of the millennium some scientists claim one of the causes of the ‘ plateau ’ in sea - surface temperature is a change in the exchange of ocean water			1
they believe this exchange is occurring between warm , surface waters and cold , deep waters below 2,300ft ( 700 metres ) – as if the warming is ‘ hiding ’ underwater			0
@entity164 trade winds of the @entity85 have increased significantly over the past two decades and as a result are blowing higher volumes of warm surface sea water to deeper depths			0
stronger trade winds blowing from @entity171 to @entity172 have had the net effect of cooling surface temperatures by a global average of between 0.1 ° c and 0.2 ° c , this would be enough to account for the apparent hiatus in global average temperatures over the past 15 years			1
the warm water wo n’t hide below the surface forever : scientists believe that it may re-emerge later or affect other climate indicators , such as sea level or ocean circulation			2
' however , the majority of the models predicted a temperature rise roughly midway between the two extremes			1
' the observed trends are sometimes at the upper limit , sometimes at the lower limit , and often in the middle , so that , taken together , the simulations appear plausible			0
' in particular , the observed trends are not skewed in any discernible way compared to the simulations , ' professor @entity48 explains			0
if that were the case , he said , it would suggest a systematic error in the models			0
the scientists are now also analysing why the simulations arrived at disparate results by looking at how the models react to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide			0
since 1998 , the warmest year on record , the steep increase in global temperatures seen during the 1990s has levelled off , failing to match computer model predictions for climate change			1
this pause , or hiatus , has been blamed on weak solar activity and increased uptake of heat by the world 's oceans			0
the @entity219 's @entity218 last year concluded that the deep oceans had been responsible for absorbing an increasing amount of heat , but warned that this could not continue indefinitely			0
however , in a paper published in november last year , atmospheric scientists at the @entity225 found that small volcanic eruptions in the early 21st century , which had been largely overlooked , were responsible for up to a third of the hiatus in warming			2
this schematic shows the trends in temperature and ocean atmosphere circulation in the @entity85 over the past two decades			0
colour shading shows observed temperature trends ( ° c per decade ) during 1992 - 2011 at the sea surface			2
the bold and thin arrows show an overall acceleration of the @entity85 moving warm , surface waters ( indicated by the blue arrow ) to below 700 metres beneath the surface			0

this is according to the the @entity32 and @entity34
they found most pessimistic and most optimistic predictions of warming in the 15 subsequent years for each year usually differed by 0.3 ° c
the long - term trend points to severe warming of the climate , they say
ocean temperatures are rising as rapidly as models have predicted
