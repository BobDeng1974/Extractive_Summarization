@entity3 signed for the @entity16 during the summer in a controversial switch from @entity18 rivals @entity19			1
kind words : @entity2 and @entity9 have both hailed @entity3 after his @entity6 call - up but his early - season form has seen him rewarded with a maiden call to the @entity6 set - up and @entity27 boss @entity2 says it is about time another ginger midfielder made the breakthrough			1
