by @entity0 published : 08:31 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 09:22 est , 7 june 2013 a young beauty blogger has posted a shocking photo diary of what happened when she suffered a severe reaction to a salon facial			1
@entity8 make - up fanatic @entity6 , who blogs under the name @entity10 at @entity11 , shared her experience online in a series of blog posts , documenting how the skin on her face became enraged by the treatment and then by medication she was given by a dermatologist in effort to calm it down			1
writing four days after her ' skin - ravaging facial ' , @entity6 warned readers with a caution : ' this post contains graphic images of a face inflamed with red , angry pimples filled with pus			1
' @entity6 , who writes under the name @entity10 , before her facial she continued : ' you might feel itchy and want to vomit after seeing these images			1
i totally understand if you run away from me if you saw me			0
' she then posted a photograph of what she usually looks like , followed by a day - by - day photographic account of how her skin reacted to the facial , first breaking out in a small number of spots , which rapidly grew in number and filled with pus			1
she visited a clinic to have the pus extracted , which only served tomake the condition worse			1
the spots were soon covering her entire face and neck , and were both painful and itchy			0
@entity6 before the facial that ravaged her skin , left , and five days after , right @entity6 immediately after the facial spots began coming through the day after her facial more and more spots began working their way through her skin two days later writing on the site , @entity6 commented : ' i 'd sent images of my deteriorating skin condition to the people at the facial salon and they asked me to go down and have the pus extracted again , this time to their hq , where their director was around			1
' i do n't know how people who have been in the industry for thirty years could n't tell this was not your normal acne breakout or post-facial sensitivity			0
' she continued : ' the facial people told me that " it has to get worse before it gets better "			1
bull * * * @entity78 anyone who tells you that about your skin is really just lying to you			0
i have friends who are aestheticians say there 's no such thing			0
if it gets worse , it can only get worse			2
' from the first round of extraction , they kept lying to me that " tomorrow your skin will be better "			0
at home , my skin turned worse			2
' despite their advice , @entity6 chose not to reveal the name of the salon , believing they did not intend to cause the reaction			1
the clusters of spots around @entity6 's chin continued to grow and grow the skin on her forehead began to break out in a pus - filled rash as well @entity6 at the clinic where they tried to treat the condition with an anti-bacterial gel that only made the complaint worse @entity6 following the pus extraction on day four @entity6 visited a number of doctors , and the second one gave her pills and told her the skin allergy should not cause any scarring , but would leave her with hyper - pigmentation for at least a few months			1
she said : ' he also advised that i go back to my skincare regime before the facial because the new products given by the salon might be contributing to the allergy			2
' @entity6 said the whole experience left her traumatised and depressed @entity6 five days after the facial five days after the facial @entity6 's skin was only getting worse after the photographs @entity6 wrote : ' i 'm sorry if i scared you			1
you ca n't imagine how difficult it was to look at these photos and not cry			0
i cry the most when i ’m washing my face			0
' my self - confidence has plummeted to rock bottom			2
i can not remember the last time i was so depressed over an external condition			2
' i guess i could thank the heavens that i ’m lucky to be alive , but can my life ever go back to normal ? i do n't know			0
it 's a great fall to take for a person who is image - conscious and with an online personality			2
' in a second blog post a few days later , she wrote : ' i was at my lowest on day 5			2
a small percentage of the pustules were starting to dry out , but more were forming , and they were merging			0
they were spreading to my neck too , and were incredibly itchy			0
' @entity6 added that she has not only lost out financially as a result of her reaction , but that when she attended the @entity8 blogging awards as a finalist she was forced to wear a mask over her face because she was so embarrassed			1
' i was at my lowest on day five ' the pustules showed no sign of abating on day five on day six , after lots of medication , the spots began to dry up the doctor told @entity6 she should expect to have discolouration of the skin for several months @entity6 ends her post saying : ' i realize i have instilled panic and fear in many people regarding the effects of a facial			1
' many have asked me to advise on whether this salon is safe to go , whether the one i went to is the one they are going to , what to look out for in a facial , etc. ' i wrote about my personal experience to share the risks involved in getting a facial			0
i do not know and can not guarantee what will happen to anybody else			0
' you may or may not be allergic to the products the salon uses , the treatment may or may not be right for you , your beauticians may or may not know what to do when they see you with uncommon pus on your face , facials may or may not work for you at all			1
' i can not speak for anyone and am not qualified to say whether or not a facial or a trip to a dermatologist is right for you			0
' i have been going for facials for the past ten years and as a beauty blogger tried a myriad of products on my skin , and nothing like that has ever happened			0
