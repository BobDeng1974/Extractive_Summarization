it remains an ugly stain on a beautiful , pristine career , the night @entity0 erred at the moment of his country ’s greatest need			1
@entity7 in @entity8 on a steamy june night and @entity9 exited the 2012 @entity10 in the semi-finals on penalties to @entity13			1
incredibly , @entity0 did n’t take a kick			1
due to take his country ’s final penalty , the contest never got that far			1
subsequently , inevitable questions were asked of his mental stature			2
did the self - proclaimed world ’s best player really hide at the back of the line ? when the dust settled , @entity0 claimed @entity9 were not allowed to change the order of takers they had submitted to the match referee			1
there is no mention of that , however , in @entity33 ’s rules			2
whatever the truth , he merely watched — hands on hips — as defenders missed penalties in front of him , and then he sat and cried on the pitch			2
as he scored four times in the group phase and then destroyed @entity61 with a play - off hat - trick , perhaps he had redemption on his mind			1
that night in @entity65 last november he was at his imperious best			0
it was a stunning individual display , a lethal mixture of arrogance and supreme desire			0
it gave credence to the theory that a fit and firing @entity0 here in @entity75 could drag @entity9 to unimagined places almost on his own			1
certainly that is the way that the @entity78 see it			0
in his home country , they recognise @entity0 for exactly what he is			1
he is their one and only chance here			2
without him they are a very modest group of players			0
with him , they immediately step up at least two levels			0
that is why that night in the east of @entity8 two years has been forgotten in his home country			2
that is why they pray his troublesome groin allows him to pay freely against @entity96 in @entity97 in @entity98 on monday			1
paying the penalty : @entity0 did not take a kick in @entity9 's @entity102 shootout elimination 51 - the number of goals scored by @entity0 for @entity106 last season , including 17 in the @entity107 ‘ there was never any need for him to make anything up to us , ’ said one @entity78 commentator recently			1
‘ what happened in @entity8 was unfortunate but we do n’t blame him			0
we do n’t think he ducked that penalty			2
‘ he is all we have			0
he never has a need to apologise , no matter what he does or does n’t do			0
’ it ’s certainly the case that , in @entity9 , @entity0 is not the type of hero who is continually asked to prove himself			1
he has 49 goals from 111 caps and his place in the national consciousness is secure			0
in @entity125 , we argue today about @entity127 ’s international future			0
over the weekend , @entity125 captain @entity128 has received criticism , too			0
that simply does n’t happen to @entity0 , even on the occasions — that are not so rare — when he appears to treat the @entity78 team merely as a showcase for his individual gifts			1
on monday night , @entity96 will know that the @entity106 forward is pretty much all that stands between them and their usual steady start to a major tournament			1
they will know also that @entity0 did n’t actually finish his season with @entity106 in particularly good form			1
stunning : @entity0 celebrates his first of three goals in the play - off against @entity61 when he was at his imperious , arrogant best and dragged @entity9 to the @entity51 @entity0 may have contributed the final act of last month ’s @entity107 final — scoring from the penalty spot in added time of extra-time — but his overall performance on the night was fitful			1
at times he looked rather tired			0
winger and a prayer : @entity9 fans will hope @entity0 has recovered from his injury in time to face @entity96 @entity156 , a team - mate for club and country , said last night : ‘ @entity0 is a very important player for us			1
he ’s the best in the world			0
he ’s a super-athlete , but he had a very exhausting season			0
‘ there is no doubt that all the games he played with us have taken a toll on him , physically and mentally			2
however , he has a tremendous will of helping the national team			0
we hope that will carry him through			0
’ testimonies and tributes to @entity0 ’s importance and brilliance have characterised @entity9 ’s lead - up to @entity75 2014			1
@entity78 journalists laugh at themselves as they admit that , at times , he is all they ever ask coach @entity179 about			0
prior to monday night ’s game , @entity180 has been quoted as saying he would happily give up his own place in @entity179 ’s squad if it helped to guarantee @entity0 ’s fitness			1
‘ a @entity51 without him is not a @entity51 , ’ said the @entity186 winger			1
@entity188 ’s sought - after holding player @entity187 , meanwhile , has described @entity0 as an ‘ inspiration ’			1
only @entity179 himself has attempted to place some sort of cap on the expectation that inevitably envelopes his team whenever @entity0 is in it			1
‘ we must deal with the pressure from outside , ’ said @entity179 on sunday night			0
‘ the fact that we have the best player in the world does n’t force us to be world champions			0
’ put your shirt on him : @entity0 is delighted after his penalty in the @entity107 final @entity0 was probably born a decade or so too late to have any real chance of winning something with his country			1
he contributed to @entity9 ’s narrow failure on home turf in @entity212 but , at 19 , was not the player then that he is now			2
the fabled golden generation of @entity215 and @entity216 may not ultimately have underachieved had @entity0 been in their midst			2
certainly the players @entity179 has to choose from now do not compare			0
@entity0 has perhaps two @entity220 left in him and this one finds him where he has always wished to be — recognised as the best in his sport			2
on sunday night , @entity224 stepped out for @entity225 but this time he does not hold star billing			0
the kid from @entity229 is the centrepiece of this year ’s @entity51			2
he has reason enough to make sure he adorns it with his unique form of dazzling brilliance .			0

@entity0 did *n't* take a spot - kick as @entity9 went out two years *ago*
he was due to take the fifth penalty but did not get chance
@entity0 scored a hat - trick in the play - off to get @entity9 to @entity51
forward is an injury doubt to face @entity96 in @entity97 in @entity98
