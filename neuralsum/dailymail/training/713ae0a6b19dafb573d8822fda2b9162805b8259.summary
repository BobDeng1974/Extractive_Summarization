@entity0 have admitted that they misled their supporters and those of feeder club @entity3 over @entity5 's contract last summer			1
the @entity7 champions have alienated thousands of the fans they were trying to woo in @entity10 by keeping @entity5 in @entity11 rather than sending him to @entity12 for the start of the @entity15 season in march			2
now senior sources at @entity0 have revealed that they made ' mistakes ' when initially announcing the terms of @entity5 's arrangement at @entity12 last summer			1
@entity0 have admitted that they have misled fans and @entity3 over @entity5 @entity5 signed for @entity3 last summer before agreeing a loan move to @entity0 @entity23 apps : 3 ( 12 as sub ) @entity25 : 5 @entity26 : 1 goals : 0 @entity28 : 1 goals : 2 @entity30 : 1 ( 1 ) @entity25 : 0 @entity31 : 6 ( 13 ) total goals : 7 initially the @entity34 website announced last july that @entity5 had signed a two - year deal to take effect from august 1 , 2014 while @entity0 's own website declared that the former @entity39 midfielder would join them ' on loan ' until december 31			1
that was repeated in a tweet sent from @entity0 's official account on august 6			0
subsequently , however , that has proved not to be the case with @entity0 now revealing that @entity5 never became a @entity3 player last summer and actually signed a short - term contract at the @entity7 club instead			1
subsequently , there was no need for a loan			0
it is understood that @entity5 only signed the equivalent of a pre-contract agreement with @entity3			1
the agreement was for him to join on january 1 but that has now been put back to july			1
the 36 - year - old 's deal due to join @entity3 on january 1 but will now go in july a series of points released to the media on friday by @entity0 are summarised as follows : * the statement on the @entity3 website in july saying @entity5 's two - year contract took effect from aug 1 , 2014 was a mistake			1
* the initial statement on the @entity0 website that it was a loan was also an error			0
there was never a break clause in @entity5 's contract dated 31 december			0
the short - term contract with @entity0 only ran to dec 31 and has now been extended			0
* there was a ' head of terms commitment ' from @entity5 to join @entity3 from jan 1 , 2015			2
that was extended to the end of this season			0
* any contract with @entity3 will now take effect from july 1 , 2015			2
the midfielder ( right ) released a statement on his @entity82 page on friday denying that he misled @entity15 fans the saga is hugely embarrassing for @entity0 , who pride themselves on being a club that does things the right way			1
equally , the situation was not helped by a peculiar statement released by @entity5 himself			2
in attempting to clarify matters , @entity5 's declaration only served to point out that he had never signed for @entity3 as initially claimed			2
the 36 - year - old said : ' i want to make it completely clear about my situation as i have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days			1
' when released from @entity39 last year at the end of my contract i signed a commitment to play for @entity3 for two years starting january 1 , 2015			1
i was then offered the chance to train and be part of the @entity0 squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into @entity12			0
' this period has since been extended by @entity0 and i will now start playing for @entity3 at the end of this current @entity7 season			0
' there has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone			0
i can say that i am very excited about arriving in @entity12 and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the @entity15 as soon as possible			0
' thanks everyone for your ongoing support and i wish everyone a healthy and happy 2015 ! ' @entity5 has scored seven goals since joining @entity0			0
