a few came to praise the new arrivals , others to bury them under disapproval for the whole notion of anyone other than the manager - even an interim caretaker serving his notice - picking the team			0
on a day when @entity10 fans had plenty to complain about , they at least managed to cheer one of the on - loan @entity14 players shoehorned into their starting @entity16 and perhaps hope , amid the wreckage of their 2 - 1 @entity19 defeat at home to @entity21 , that @entity24 ’s goal - scoring debut is a sign of what to expect , once the rest of his mates are in harness			1
@entity24 , on loan from @entity14 , celebrates scoring on his debut for @entity10 despite @entity24 's strike , @entity10 were knocked out of the @entity19 fifth round at home to @entity21 @entity24 smashes in a shot from the edge of the area to equalise against @entity21 for @entity10 the midfielder ( left ) roars his delight after scoring as @entity39 jumps on his back to congratulate him of the five @entity14 men sent on loan to @entity10 , only centre - half @entity43 and winger @entity24 were deemed fit enough to play on sunday ; the command and control structure at @entity10 does not , as yet , force the manager to field players medically unable to run the length of themselves			1
@entity43 did n’t even make it until half - time before adding himself to the list of the injured , so the 20 - year - old did n’t have much of a chance to impress			0
although the sight of him limping off after being outmuscled by @entity56 - not a big man - after 43 minutes might raise some questions over his ability to cope with the physical side of first - team football			0
fellow debutant and loanee @entity43 ( left ) was forced off after only 44 minutes through injury @entity24 ( right ) , one of five loanees from @entity14 to @entity10 , is tackled by @entity21 's @entity66 while on the pitch , he made one perfectly - time challenge to prevent a @entity21 counter-attack			1
and , erm , that was about it			0
@entity24 , a 22 - year - old full international for @entity72 , had played a handful of first - team games on loan spells at @entity77 @entity76 and then @entity78			2
on paper , he looked the best of the five new arrivals			0
switching wings playing through the middle , @entity24 looked to have a decent touch and reasonable movement , although his first real chance to shine saw him run straight into the venerable @entity87 , a @entity21 stalwart who has seen off more potent threats than him in his time			2
@entity43 looks on as he makes his debut at @entity91 for @entity10 in the @entity19 fifth round on sunday @entity24 ( left ) smashes @entity10 level at @entity91 in the @entity19 fifth round tie on sunday caught in possession and wasteful on occasion , he showed the potential - and might have scored had a looping header and goalmouth scramble fallen differently just before half - time			1
then , after looking a little lost as @entity21 took the lead and the home fans grew increasingly restless , @entity24 peeled away to receive a @entity103 pass and score with superb low left - footed strike			2
it was n’t his fault that his new team - mates could n’t even hang on for a replay			0
actually , having played in front of a mostly empty stadium in a rank rotten performance , do you think the player himself might be having second thoughts about this move ? @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity24 were unveiled to the media after signing for @entity10 @entity118 , @entity24 and @entity120 were put through their paces in their last @entity10 training session with @entity14 players now moving to @entity10 on loan , @entity125 's interest in the club continues to grow			1
