five species of sharks and two manta rays were given protection under the convention on @entity12 ( cites )			1
governments voted earlier in the week in favour of the move to list the sharks and rays as species under the @entity13 treaty , which will mean the international trade in them is strictly regulated to ensure it is sustainable			1
protection : a @entity26 shark			2
the species which is native to @entity6 waters is among five species of sharks and two manta rays which have been given protection under the convention on @entity12 ' shark populations are in free fall , but have been thrown a lifeline today - cites has finally listened to the scientists , ' @entity31 , director of conservation for the @entity33 , said			1
he added : ' this is a tremendous result , reflecting years of campaigning for trade controls for these high - value species			2
' now parties face the challenge of implementation , and we urge the @entity46 to reach out and assist less - developed nations with capacity building and practical implementation			0
' there were concerns that the final cites meeting in @entity53 , @entity54 , could reverse the decision but the move was confirmed yesterday			0
a fisherman carries a hammerhead shark at @entity60 beach some 240 kilometers east of @entity61 , @entity62 two species of manta rays were also given protection under the convention conservationists say protection is necessary to reverse declining numbers of sharks and rays , which are being overfished for food and so - called @entity73 , or @entity73			1
almost 100 million sharks are caught every year , targeted largely for their fins for use in shark fin soup , which is a delicacy in @entity79 and especially in @entity80 , wildlife experts say			2
hunters hack the fins off live animals and then toss the creatures back into the ocean to drown			0
many of @entity80 's richest citizens believe the soup has medicinal benefits and serve it at celebrations			0
each fin can fetch up to £ 380 ( $ 600 ) a pound , with a single bowl of the prized soup fetching up to £ 108			0
but as species which are slow - growing and slow to reproduce , the sharks are vulnerable to overfishing			1

some countries have been reluctant to include marine species , which can generate large revenues , in the treaty that regulates or bans international trade in wildlife			2
the shark fin business is worth an estimated £ 320 million a year			0
bad taste : a bowl of shark fin soup			0
the dish sells for up to £ 108 at @entity80 restaurants @entity6 fisheries minister @entity134 welcomed the move : ' i am extremely pleased to see that the @entity26 , three @entity137 , the @entity139 sharks and the @entity141 rays have all received greater protection under cites			1
' the @entity6 government has been leading calls for greater protection of sharks and i feel very strongly that trade in these vulnerable species must be regulated to ensure it is sustainable and so i welcome the positive step that cites has taken			1
' until 2010 , there was small fishing quota for porbeagle sharks in @entity6 and other @entity156 waters when commercial landings were banned due to overfishing			1
the sharks were caught as bycatch rather than targeted			2
the decline of porbeagles in the @entity163 is worse than anywhere else in the world			0
they can grow to more than 11.5 feet ( 3.5 metres ) long and their prey is mainly fish such as mackerel , herring and pilchard			0
a 10 - feet long porbeagle hooked by two anglers off the @entity175 coast last year is believed to be the biggest recorded in @entity6 waters – they released it alive			1
a @entity179 agency also warned yesterday shark populations in the @entity181 and @entity182 ' have dropped dramatically ' over the past two centuries because of overfishing			0
a study released by the @entity187 - based @entity186 says sharks in the @entity181 have declined by more than 97 percent over the past 200 years and ' risk extinction if current fishing pressure continues			0
