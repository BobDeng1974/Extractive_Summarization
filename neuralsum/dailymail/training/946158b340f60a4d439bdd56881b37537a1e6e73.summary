ms @entity9 said : ' it was daunting to realise just how rare the condition was - and how few specialists there were in the world who were capable of advising us on it , but to realise what we were facing lifted a weight off my shoulders			1
' i knew that something was n’t right , and to have that eventually confirmed felt like a vindication			1
' ms @entity9 ’s pregnancy with @entity8 was relatively straightforward until her unborn daughter stopped growing at 28 weeks			1

i wanted to feed her , but if i ’d had held her to my breast , i would have smothered her			0
' it was very concerning , but again i was told that there was nothing to worry about - that all of her scans had come back as normal , and she would develop in her own time			2
