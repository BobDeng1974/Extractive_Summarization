’ @entity1 has been in distinctly patchy form since his @entity38 call , with four of his next 10 games coming from the bench			1

he said : ‘ it is about doing your job properly and understanding the role you are playing , not just for yourself , but for the team			2
i have spoken to him about this and he has to learn , otherwise he wo n’t play games			2
‘ i do n’t want to be in that position where he gets a yellow and i ’m thinking the rest of the game that there could be a sending - off			0
i should n’t have to worry , so it is n’t my problem , it is @entity1 ’s			1
i see him every day and his ability is frightening			0
i have said i am more than willing to give him the chance to show it , but you also need to want it yourself			0
i think he does want it , but he also needs to understand the time for being lazy with it is gone			0
he has to push himself			0
he ’s not a kid any more			0

he said : ‘ we spoke together , cleared up a few things and that was a positive discussion			0
i will keep my head down and work hard and try to do my best			0
‘ i will not discuss what we said , but it was an honest meeting			0
that is always a positive			0
the negative thing was being out of the team but you try to make it a positive and that is what i am trying to do			2
sometimes you can reflect on certain things when you are out of the team because during the busy periods you maybe do n’t get a chance to			2
