@entity0 must be getting tired of his visits to @entity2 being cut short after a dubious sending off within 32 seconds put paid to @entity4 's chances of overcoming @entity5			1
a first - half penalty from @entity7 and @entity9 ’s second - half strike moved @entity5 three points clear at the top of the @entity12 having played a game more than @entity14 in second			1

referee : @entity71 @entity4 got the offence overturned and manager @entity73 is considering appealing again this time around as their was a man covering and @entity5 ’s @entity44 was far from goal when he was scythed down by the defender and @entity71 produced the red card			1
