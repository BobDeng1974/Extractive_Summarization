@entity0 knows how many times at @entity2 i ’ve felt like falling to my knees at the back of the @entity6 and banging my head on the floor			2
a lifetime of following @entity11 can have that effect on you , especially in recent years			2
last saturday ’s inept capitulation to @entity15 was the most recent occasion : a soft goal down after 45 minutes and an expensively assembled team which looked as if it had been recruited from the local @entity19 half an hour before the kick - off			1
@entity21 took this photograph of @entity23 and @entity24 praying at @entity25 last month had i actually gone through with it , however , within seconds i ’d have been hauled to my feet by the stewards and steered unceremoniously towards the exit			1
they are especially vigilant when it comes to anyone blocking the gangways or stairwells			2
and given football ’s tragic history , from @entity39 to @entity40 , their caution is well - merited			1
so it was surprising , to say the least , to see that photograph of two muslim @entity44 supporters praying to @entity45 at half - time in an @entity48 match			1
they had rolled out their prayer mat at the foot of some stairs beneath the stand , apparently with the full consent of safety staff			1
one of the men , solicitor @entity23 , 46 , from @entity57 , explained that because the televised game did n’t kick off until 4pm , the final whistle would have blown too late for them to pray outside the ground			1
so perhaps we can point the finger at television			2
matches are shifted all over the shop by the schedulers , for purely commercial reasons			2
for instance , those irritating lunchtime games are designed for the benefit of bookmakers and betting syndicates in the @entity73 , not season ticket holders			2
travelling fans often complain that evening games mean it is impossible for them to catch the last train home			1
but this may be the first time that a late kick - off for the convenience of television has played havoc with the @entity44 call to prayer			1
the extraordinary scene was captured on a mobile phone camera by @entity44 supporter @entity21			1
he tweeted the photograph with the caption ‘ muslims praying at half - time at the match yesterday # disgrace			1
’ in no time , predictably , the balloon went up			1
with the customary restraint for which social media is renowned , the usual online lynch - mob were branding him a ‘ bigot ’ and a ‘ disgrace to humanity ’			1
the incident took place when @entity44 were playing @entity108 at @entity25 in march needless to say , someone reported the tweet to @entity111 , who for once exercised commendable sanity and decided not to get involved			1
but @entity44 is investigating , saying discrimination will not be tolerated and promising to take ‘ appropriate action ’			1
to their enormous credit , mr @entity23 and his partner in prayer @entity24 are urging restraint			1
‘ i ’ve supported @entity44 for 40 years and i used to be a season ticket holder , ’ mr @entity23 said			1
‘ from what i understand , this guy does n’t live too far from the ground and is probably a boyhood fan , so i would n’t want him excluded from the ground or anything			2
‘ he should be given a talking to and made to go on an awareness course or educating			2
’ why ? most people would agree that labelling the photograph a # disgrace was an intemperate over-reaction			2
but this was a real ‘ @entity135 , @entity136 ! ’ moment			2
you do n’t expect to stumble over @entity93 praying in a stairwell at a football ground midway through a @entity48 tie			1
quite apart from the safety considerations , even those of us who believe people should be free to practise their religion of choice also believe there is a time and a place			1
and @entity150 go to @entity25 to worship at the shrine of @entity152 , not @entity153 or the @entity154			0
how would the management have reacted if some devout @entity156 had decided to stage a holy communion at half - time ? or the queue for the gents ’ was obstructed by a conga line of chanting @entity162 ? what if a handful of @entity44 fans had turned up at the local mosque and started singing @entity163 in the middle of friday prayers ? would their claim to be exercising their democratic right to celebrate their religion stop the @entity175 steaming in and nicking them for ‘ hate crime ’ ? what do you think ? mr @entity23 seems to be an eminently reasonable and civilised man			1
what i ’d like to ask him would be when , in his four decades of supporting @entity44 , he first started praying during games at @entity25 ? i may be wrong , but my guess would be that this is a fairly recent phenomenon			1
as the @entity44 population of @entity186 has grown to three million , @entity188 ‘ rights ’ have become increasingly more assertive			1
we have de facto @entity191 law in some areas of our cities ; halal food imposed in schools , hospitals and works ’ canteens ; and now even gelatine - free halal @entity201 counters in supermarkets			1
over the past decade or so , what we have seen is @entity186 society being obliged to bend to the demands of @entity188			0
such is the contradiction inherent in our @entity209 - imposed ‘ multiculturalism ’ tyranny that more latitude is extended to @entity93 than any other group or religion			1
look , i ’m a supporter of the @entity48 ’s anti-racism @entity214 campaign			1
football crowds are gradually becoming more diverse , and not before time			1
this remarkable photograph from @entity25 is evidence of that			0
the game is awakening to cultural differences			0
at the @entity223 in @entity224 a few years ago , they were selling balti pies at the @entity108 end , while knocking out over-priced smoked salmon bagels in the @entity11 ’ section of the stadium			0
someone must have told them @entity108 has one of @entity186 ’s biggest @entity234 populations and @entity11 has a large number of @entity237 supporters			0
so no stereotyping there , then			0
@entity241 pies are one thing			0
but back to more serious matters			0
did n’t it occur to mr @entity23 and mr @entity24 that if the kick - off at @entity25 clashed with their religious obligations then perhaps the wisest course of action would simply be to give the game a miss ? ok , so there were only two of them this time			1
but what if next season there ’s a dozen , or two dozen , or 200 , all expecting the right to pray where they like ? where do you draw the line ? at this rate , it wo n’t be long before @entity44 fans start demanding special prayer rooms at football grounds , just as there are already in public buildings and police custody suites			1
soon it will become a legal requirement			0
when it does , remember : you read it here first			0
a @entity278 prince , @entity277 , has challenged @entity279 to a duel in @entity282 ’s @entity281 , accusing the @entity284 leader of stirring up hatred against @entity287 immigrants			0
brandishing a sabre , he threw down the gauntlet : ‘ are you up for it , mr @entity279 ? ’ he ’ll have to get @entity279 out of the pub first			0
maybe it would be better if he challenged him to a vodka drinking contest			0
i ’d be happy to referee , in exchange for a couple of bottles of @entity298			0
if it ’s a duel he ’s after , @entity277 should invite @entity300			0
@entity301 probably learnt to fence at @entity303			0
come to think of it , instead of bothering with the campaign , why not a series of @entity306 - style contests to decide the election ? @entity311 ‘ 14 pints ’ @entity310 could represent the @entity312 in the drinking round			1
@entity314 and @entity315 could stage a winner - takes - all bacon sandwich eating competition			1
and how about a mud - wrestling tournament , involving @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , that @entity323 bird and the @entity325 madwoman from the @entity326 ? it would certainly beat the hell out of last night ’s leaders ’ debate			2
bristols at dawn ! sorry , but i do n't agree with @entity334 when the @entity336 ’s political editor @entity335 went off air in march to be treated for a tumour on his lung , i wished him a speedy recovery			0
i ’m an admirer of @entity335 and at the time described him as a beacon of impartiality in a bog of @entity336 bias			2
this week he returned , but with such a raspy , whispery voice it was difficult to make out what he was saying			0
@entity335 's eagerness to resume work is understandable , but he should have been told to complete his recovery his eagerness to resume work is understandable , but he should have been told to complete his recovery			0
he ’s not doing the viewers or , more importantly , himself any favours			0
it ’s like @entity357 going on to @entity358 with one arm in plaster			0
get well , soon , @entity334			0
and do n’t worry about the election for now			0
you ’re not missing much			0
a woman cried rape when her boyfriend found out that she had taken part in a threesome with a married couple , @entity363 has been told			0
but @entity370 had been a willing participant and exchanged texts with the couple telling them how much she ’d enjoyed it			0
this week she admitted wasting police time and was remanded for reports			2
given the bracing weather in @entity363 , she should have told her boyfriend they were only huddling together to keep warm			0
fore ! that 's a long drive the day after i wondered why fitness freaks have to wear electronic wrist - bands to monitor their every bodily function , the @entity381 published a report claiming health apps are positively harmful — because they convince the ‘ worried well ’ that there ’s something seriously wrong with them			2
spooky , or what ? you can also get wrist - bands which tell you the distances to the holes on every golf course in @entity186			2
a friend of mine checked his app as he was driving home from a golf tour of @entity403			0
it told him he was 253 miles from the 18th green at @entity406 .			0

image shows two men praying at half - time during @entity48 clash
how would the management have reacted if some devout @entity156 had decided to stage a holy communion at half - time ?
@entity44 fans could start demanding special prayer rooms at stadiums
