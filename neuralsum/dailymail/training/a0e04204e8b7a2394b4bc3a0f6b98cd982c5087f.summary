by @entity0 published : 11:32 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 11:32 est , 25 may 2012 millions of ten - inch - long mice have colonised a 25 - mile - wide island - and are decimating local bird populations			1
@entity4 is a remote @entity5 colony between the tips of @entity7 and @entity8 - inhabited by 10 million birds , in 20 rare species but mice , introduced 150 years ago , are now eating their way through 1.25 million chicks a year - and scientists are calling for the invaders to be exterminated			1
one of @entity4 's ' monster mice ' feeds on a dead seabird - now scientists are calling for the introduced mice to be eradicated @entity21 is calling for introduced mice to be dealt with as a threat on @entity4 and similar remote places - and for the mice of @entity4 to be exteriminated ' the sheer densities of the numbers of birds there â€” that 's why @entity4 is so special , ' said study co-author @entity21 , of the @entity31 in an interview with @entity33			1
' but the mice seem to be chewing away through those			2
' the local mice have grown , and now measure ten inches from nose to tail			2
@entity21 is calling for introduced mice to be dealt with as a threat on @entity4 and similar remote places - and for the mice of @entity4 to be exteriminated			1
' we studied the fate of 178 @entity44 incerta nests at @entity4 , over four seasons , from october 2003 to january 2008			0
' introduced house mice @entity47 were found in all study burrows checked for mouse visits , ' says @entity21			2
@entity21 witnessed mice devouring six healthy petrel chicks , and one great shearwater chicks			1
every year , chicks died from mouse attacks - and less than 25 % survived to adulthood			1
' however , in the one season studied from laying to fledging ( 2007 ) , from 58 nests , only one chick fledged , ' says @entity21			0
northern @entity58 on @entity4 , @entity59 the reality may be even more severe , says @entity21 , after computer - modelling various estimates of the fate of @entity4			0
' more than 60 % of model simulations resulted in an @entity65 classification of @entity66 , ' says @entity21			0
' our results add support to calls to eradicate mice from @entity4			0
more generally , mice can not be ignored as a potential threat to island fauna , and island restoration and management plans should routinely include eradication of introduced mice			0

less than a quarter of chicks live to adulthood
millions of mice infest remote @entity5 colony just 25 miles wide
scientists call for invaders to be exterminated
