increasing numbers of students are taking the pills which are being sold online for as little as £ 2 each growing numbers of students at some of @entity7 ’s best universities may be putting their health at risk after an ‘ explosion ’ in the numbers taking a ‘ smart drug ’ bought via the internet			1
doctors say increasing numbers of teenagers are using the prescription - only medicine @entity18 to stay awake and alert for long periods			1
the drug is designed to combat narcolepsy			1
however , research shows it is available to anyone from dozens of online retailers			1
anecdotal evidence suggests that as the new academic year begins there is now a black market at universities including @entity30 and @entity31 with students selling it to each other for around £ 2 a pill , @entity25 has reported			2
some students are said to be demanding drug tests before exams to eliminate a practice they believe to be equivalent to cheating			1
one @entity30 student said he believed that up to a quarter of his student friends had taken @entity18 , of which the long - term effects are not known			0
buying prescription - only drugs is not illegal , although supplying them is			2
@entity47 , professor of clinical neuropsychology at @entity31 , said there had been an ‘ explosion ’ in the number of students taking @entity18 in recent years			1
she said : ' a lot of young people are purchasing these drugs over the internet , which is a very unsafe way to get these drugs because you do n’t really know what you ’re getting and you do n’t know if it ’s safe for you as an individual			2
' ms @entity47 added some students feel pressure to take the drug in order to keep up with their fellow students			1
' there ’s this kind of coercion that goes on			0
' i think a lot of students feel it ’s very unfair that other students are taking these drugs during exams and they feel that they ’re losing out because the other person has a competitive advantage			1
' some students feel when you go into the exam perhaps there should be a test to see whether you ’re on the drug or not , because otherwise there ’s no way of detecting whether you are or not			1
' though @entity86 said there is no firm evidence that taking ' smart drugs ' is widespread among students , professor @entity85 expressed concern for the growing problem			1
' what are the effects of putting a drug into and changing the chemicals in your brain as your brain ’s developing ? ' she asked			2
' what will society be like in the future ? will we all be just popping pills to stay awake , and alert and keep working ? will we accelerate into a 24/7 society ? is that what we really want ? ' @entity108 , a masters student at @entity30 , admits taking the drug every few weeks			1
he said : ' some people report that they become very focused or very good at concentrating on a repetitive task			0
' i have found the ability to go without sleep , when necessary , quite effective			0
it ’s essentially like caffeine , just a bit more effective and with less jitters			0
' the people i ’ve met who offer me @entity18 for sale , they ’ve all been fellow students , or academic types , rather than your stereotypical wheeler dealer in a hoodie down a dark alley			2
' dr @entity128 , research fellow at @entity30 ’s @entity129 uses @entity18 every one or two weeks			0
some university students are calling for drug testing before exams as they feel their classmates who take the drugs are ' cheating ' while he believes he is doing himself no harm , he would rather be able to get the drug from his gp			1
' going via an internet drug store means the money ends up in the grey market , and that ’s problematic , ' he said			2
' you might be feeding your money into a market that is actually doing a lot of harm in the world			0
it would be much better if it were in the open market , which would mean that we could actually control that it ’s actually healthy , that side effects get reported , that you could actually study it properly			0
' i do n’t regard the use itself as immoral or problematic			0
i ’m not competing with anyone else			0
i am taking the risks on my own			2
' buying prescription only drugs is not illegal			2
however , supplying them is			0
@entity86 released statement however contradicting people 's concerns the problem is growing out of control			0
they said : ' we would be very concerned if the impression were given that most students at @entity7 universities are now taking ... ’ smart drugs ’			1
we are not aware of any new research or data to suggest that such drugs are widely used and available among the @entity7 ’s higher education student population of 2.5 million students			1
' such unsubstantiated claims could cause real and unnecessary alarm to students and parents and , perversely , could serve to inspire students to obtain such drugs illegally for fear of being at a competitive disadvantage			1
' @entity7 universities take the issue of drug abuse very seriously and would have grave concerns about students taking drugs not prescribed to them by a doctor			1
not only is this illegal but it also poses health risks to those students			2
' all universities have policies relating to alcohol and substance abuse			0
' all universities would advise students under pressure to seek advice from university counselling services , welfare officers or their gp			2
' students at top universities such as @entity30 ( pictured ) and @entity31 are among the many who have resorted to taking ' smart drugs ' during exams a spokesman for the @entity213 ( @entity213 ) said : ' @entity18 is a prescription only medicine			1
' it should only be taken following a full consultation with a doctor who can fully assess you for any possible risks associated with taking a medicine			0
' people who buy medicines without the benefit of a consultation with an appropriate healthcare professional run the risk being supplied with medicines that are not safe or suitable for them to use			0
' an @entity30 spokesman said : ' if ‘ cognitive enhancement ’ drugs are a particular problem at @entity30 we have yet to see any substantive evidence for it			0
we would strongly advise students against taking any drugs that have not been prescribed to them as this could involve putting their health at risk			1
' a spokesman for @entity31 said : ' the use of prescription drugs without the approval of a qualified medical practitioner is not to be recommended under any circumstance as unforeseen side effects can be serious			0
' hence we would advise any student to take appropriate medical advice before considering taking any prescription drugs , including those such as @entity18 , @entity254 , or @entity255			1
' more generally , we would encourage students to talk to their supervisors , tutor , director of studies or senior tutor if they ’re having difficulties with their studies for any reason			0
' by sharing any problems , they together should be able to develop improved academic good practice and appropriate confidence			0
' these should do away with any perceived need for performance enhancers of any type other than those developed through expertise and academic study			0
