it ’s official , @entity0 is @entity2 ’s best player			1
he started with a reputation as a dribbler , but his speed , link - up play and movement makes him such a threat			0
and it was good to see @entity0 and @entity10 doing what they do for @entity13 on a weekly basis			1
@entity10 goes at defenders whenever he can , runs off the back of people and if he ca n’t get past he ’ll look for a one - two			2
@entity0 is good at moving into the space @entity10 vacates and the pair linked up well all night			1
on paper it looked like 4 - 4 - 2 but @entity0 and @entity35 were given licence to come in off the line			2
it ’s so easy for wide men to stick to their wings , and @entity2 have been crying out for flexibility			2
on wednesday night there were promising signs , now they just have to increase the number of shots on goal			0
threat : @entity35 ( above ) was given licence to roam against @entity24 save energy for @entity51 at one stage on wednesday night i was slightly worried the side might be expending too much energy			0
we are a proud nation trying to make amends after a poor @entity59 , but the game that matters this week is the qualifier against @entity51 on monday			0
with 65 minutes on the clock , we still had a few players charging around and after weeks of intensive club football that can take its toll			0
@entity20 made his substitutions in the nick of time			0
time for a new midfield generation with @entity2 no longer able to call on @entity70 and @entity71 , the next generation need to make their mark in the middle			0
both were exceptional servants for @entity2 , but @entity76 and @entity77 both looked as if they were playing with a greater freedom in their absence			1
@entity77 was hitting his passes with a real punch — he made more in the first half than the entire @entity24 midfield — and @entity76 was going at and past people in a way we have n’t seen for more than a year			1
new dawn : @entity77 ( left ) and @entity76 look to be playing with freedom at @entity89			1

@entity0 is @entity2 's best player
the @entity13 winger is a *constant* threat to his *opposition*
@entity0 's connection with @entity10 is an *exciting* *prospect*
@entity76 and @entity77 played with freedom
