by @entity0 dna tests are being carried out on bones thought to belong to kings and queens from 1,000 years ago , including @entity5			1
experts at @entity7 are studying the contents of mortuary chests full of bones , which are expected to include those of former @entity13 and @entity14 monarchs			1
the conservation work at the cathedral had focused on the chests themselves rather than the bones inside them			2
dna analysis is taking place on bones thought to belong to ancient kings and queens at @entity7 , pictured but an official cathedral tour guide is thought to let slip to visitors that focus was shifting to analysing the bones			1
she told a group of tourists : ' what 's happening here is very exciting			0
' we 've begun work here to look at the dna of some of our oldest kings			0
' the last ancient royal bones to be found were those of @entity42 , pictured here in a facial reconstruction rumours are now circulating that a confidential deal has been signed with a television company to produce a documentary about the work			1
however , this was denied by @entity7 , which attracts 300,000 visitors a year			2
@entity52 , who ruled from 611 to 643 as well as @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 are all thought to be interred in the caskets			0
the bones of @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity5 and his wife @entity60 of @entity61 could also be inside			1
if they do belong to ancient kings and queens , they will be the first ancient bones to be discovered since those of @entity42 , which were uncovered under a car park in @entity69 in 2012			1
the work to identify the bones will also be a difficult task as those inside the @entity7 chests are not in order			1
in 1642 during the @entity78 , @entity77 troops stormed the cathedral , with the large bones used to smash the building 's precious stained glass windows			0
when they were gathered up and returned to the chests in 1661 , it was not known which bones went together , meaning some might have been mixed up			0
they remained in place for 350 years until two years ago when they were moved from the cathedral 's quire by the altar to the @entity92 in the east of the building			0
this is now closed off to visitors as the chests - six in total - are lined up under strong lighting behind a screen while the @entity37 work is ongoing			0
in addition , the bones of @entity14 monarch @entity103 , who was felled by arrow on august 2 , 1100 in the @entity105 , are expected to be interred at the cathedral			0
@entity7 , which attracts 300,000 visitors a year has six mortuary chests of bones that are being studied			2

bones at @entity7 are thought to belong to ancient monarchs
dna tests are being carried out to establish who they belong to
some of the remains are thought to be those of @entity5
the last ancient royal bones discovered were those of @entity42 in 2012
