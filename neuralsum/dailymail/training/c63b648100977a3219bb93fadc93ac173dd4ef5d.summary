@entity1 producer @entity0 has more or less confirmed that @entity2 will be killed off on the show ’s september 29 season premiere			1
there has been speculation for months about just who will get the chop after @entity0 revealed during a publicity tour last year that a major character would be written out of the show			1
at the time he said : ‘ ' i 'll give you a clue that the actor playing the character won an @entity16 for playing that character , but i wo n't say who it is			0
’ no more clowning around : it seems that @entity2 will make his last appearance on @entity1 in september acclaimed : @entity2 's rasping voice comes courtesy of @entity24 ( left ) , while strong hints about the character 's demise came from executive @entity28 ( right ) it was n’t much of a clue considering that almost all of the actors who supplied voices for the main @entity1 characters have taken home emmys			1
but at a @entity37 panel on sunday on @entity38 , @entity0 all but confirmed that the caustic clown is the character that ’s in the writers ’ cross-hairs			0
he said that the episode in which the character died would be called a clown in the dumps , which drew gasps from the audience			1
there is , however , a chance that the character being axed is @entity2 ’s father , rabbi @entity52 , voiced by @entity53 , or @entity54 , voiced by @entity55 , as they have both won @entity58 for their voice work			1
he added : ‘ it ’s a terrific character and it [ happens in ] our premiere this coming year			2
' idol : @entity64 ( left ) is a huge fan of @entity2 @entity24 , who voices @entity2 , told the @entity65 that the character is a chance for the writers to ' take shots at comedians or tv shows they 've written for , so they can put it all into @entity2 '			1
even though he presents a kiddy show , @entity24 said , ' he 's been compared to @entity73 ... the old time comics , who 've got to have everything done just right , but also steeped in @entity78 showbusiness '			0
he added : ' for a while they tried to do @entity2 out of his make - up , but then they said " just leave him in make - up all of the time "			2
the original idea , he said , was that ' @entity64 idolised @entity2 and @entity87 [ @entity88 ] designed him to look like @entity89 and he was going to do something where it turned out that @entity89 really was @entity2 and he abandoned that very quickly '			2
@entity92 explained that the idea is that ' @entity64 subconsciously idolises @entity89 , but he ca n't really , so he does it through this kiddy show host '			0
the season , which premieres in the @entity95 in september , is the show 's 26th			1
in 2009 it surpassed @entity98 as the longest running primetime television show			0
since its debut in 1989 it has broadcast 552 episodes			0
following @entity0 's announcement about the title of the first episode of the new season , bookmaker @entity103 slashed the odds of @entity2 being axed from 14/1 to just 3/1			1
@entity103 has @entity54 as favourite to kill @entity2 , with odds of 7/2 that he 'll do the deed			0
as to how @entity2 goes , @entity103 has priced up a few possibilities , with the outsider option being death by doughnut at 33/1 - and dying while saving @entity64 's life the most likely at 3/1			2
a circus accident gets odds of 5/1 , crushed by a piano 8/1 , frightened to death 12/1 and being run over by @entity89 .			0

there has been much speculation about a @entity1 character being axed
producer said the character will die in an episode called @entity129 in the dumps
this strongly suggests that @entity2 will be written out
character 's last appearance will be on the season premiere in september
