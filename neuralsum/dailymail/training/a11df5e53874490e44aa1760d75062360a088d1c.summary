concerned : vice principal @entity46 told parents in a letter that there were more spiders than expected deserted : the school playground is empty after the false widow infestation caused staff to close the building ' unfortunately , there have been further ‘ false widow ’ spiders identified in other areas of the academy			1

symptoms can include severe swelling , chest pains and tingling of fingers , with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected			0
mr @entity191 , 66 , pictured here holding an image of his injury and a jar containing a spider , was bitten on the toe by the spider while making a bonfire at his home in @entity200 , @entity201 , last year the species was first spotted in the @entity5 in @entity203 , @entity204 , in 1879			1
also known as steatoda nobilis , it is frequently confused for the black widow , which has deadly venom			0

the species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull			0
they have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size			0
the @entity225 says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the @entity5 , having been found mainly in southern @entity228			2
this theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them			0
nasty wound : @entity235 can cause severe issue damage can cause death to those allergic to it - although there has not been a recorded @entity5 death the false black widow , which is said to be spreading further north due to warmer weather , has the worst bite of any spider in the @entity5			0
