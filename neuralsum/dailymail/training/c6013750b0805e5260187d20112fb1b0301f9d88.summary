@entity0 comes close to the bliss of glowing tanned and healthily on an almost - clear fine sand beach , palm trees cocooning you in 32 - degree heat , a light breeze , a blended iced coffee by your side and a tropical sea inches from your sun lounger			2
it 's the ultimate image of holiday - that precious two weeks away from your desk , for which you save up all year			2
but what if instead of simply letting all your worries go on a beach , you could take your break away from everyday life one step further , by not only removing your city suit , but taking off your clothes altogether			2
this is what sets the @entity26 based @entity25 resorts apart from other similar destinations			1
situated equal distance from @entity29 and @entity30 on @entity33 's @entity32 coast , @entity34 and @entity35 adjoin - but while one requires clothing , the other is nudist			1
a large pool with a bar in the middle of @entity35 is the ideal place to sip cocktails and chat ... in the nude the beach view from @entity34 is blissful - and @entity35 guests are welcome and for a daily rate curious guests from @entity34 can dip their toes into its sister resort 's clothing optional policy			1
at @entity34 , up to 1,000 guests stay at any one time and have their pick of several fine international retaurants - including a standout @entity55 place that does great sushi			1
it 's a grand building with daily beach side activities and a breathtaking spa ( more of that later )			2
next door is another couples resort that those in the know call the ' happy place '			2
they 've got just 42 rooms , one pool , pool bar and restaurant			1
guests here can stay as clothed or as naked as they like			1
mainly , of course , they 're naked			2
they have a strictly no swingers policy			2
both resorts are called ' @entity76 ' , rather than all - inclusive - as they provide something more than a five - star package holiday			1
the menu is varied and exceptional			2
our room was huge , which is standard , and had a flat screen tv , jacuzzi bathroom and bed on the balcony i was initially invited to @entity35 to sample their latest evening entertainment schedule of chocolate and uv body painting parties , courtesy of international party firm @entity92			1
when i found out the resort itself was nudist , i was kind of excited to try it out			2
what could possibly go wrong ? and in fact i envisioned the experience of removing clothes as one which accentuates the feeling of having an ultimate break from reality			0
it 's well known that nudist resorts are generally quite expensive , and frequented by high - powered professionals who wear a uniform of suits and spend their lives presenting an image			1
so they come here to let that all go - quite literally			0
but of course , it was quite the unnerving proposal ; staying somewhere so - liberated - when i 'd never tried nudism before			0
so i organised to stay at @entity34 and visit @entity35 for a full day , and also for the two themed painting parties			1
a room service breakfast of coconut cream jombo oat porridge , vegetable omlette , fruit plates and coffee after a breakfast of salmon and eggs by the sand at @entity34 my nervous friend and i , wearing bikinis and towels , walked all of 10 steps to @entity35 next door			1
we observed the private and very exclusive scene : a large pool with a bar in the middle with volleyball set up next to it ; six couples playing a game , a couple more propped up sipping cocktails , cheering on their friends and chatting to staff			1
everyone at @entity35 really get along with each other ; it 's like a holiday for a bunch of extended friends with the only twist being that everyone 's naked			1
most people were a couple decades older than my friend and i , so after all of about two minutes sitting on the sun loungers we felt confident enough to whip off our bikini tops and bottoms			0
we had a feeling that we might , in a strange way , feel more uncomfortable actually wearing clothes			0
soon we were in that pool playing game after game of volleyball , having a blast and making real friends			1
and we 'd hardly said a word to any of our fellow guests back at @entity34			1
guests from the adjoining hotel can sample the @entity35 experience themselves if they wish for £ 89 ( € 100 ) a day ; and if they only wanted to attend the evening parties they can do so for the same ( unless you 're staying at either resort , you ca n't attend )			1
the chocolate body painting party started out with pretty designs - before it turned into a food fight the body painting party catering included a table of chocolate - dipped fruit and marshmallows on sticks @entity35 guests can go back and forth between both resorts as they please , and they tend to do so especially for the restaurants			1
at the @entity188 party , as well as your usual party equation of band , free bar , black light and dancefloor , a @entity188 spray paint artist came to decorate everyone 's bodies with beautiful designs ; namely @entity200 flowers on the women and wild animals on the men			0
the chocolate body painting party involved a giant table of chocolate desserts , a bucket of chocolate sauce with paint brushes , squirty cream and a live band			0
when you 're already naked you may as well get creative			0
my friend and i began painting sugar skulls and floral scenes on each other 's backs , but a couple hours later squirty cream was getting sprayed around and it escalated into a full blown food fight			0
it was great , but it was definitely time to shower			0
also , by this point we 'd eaten too much cake			0
@entity224 were of course one of the first people to discover chocolate , drinking cacao beverages as far back as 1900 bc. it felt fun and crazy but kind of authentic to the location			0
after that initiation , i was eager for the full alternative holiday experience so made sure to book in for a @entity235 ritual with the on - site spa 's very own shaman			0
the shaman told us to choose a musical instrument at the start of the ritual - before getting in the temazcal the experience involves chants , sweat , invocation , and the steam from herbs said to purify and relax you the holistic sauna ritual known as a ' house of steam ' is set in a cave - like structure and is certainly the hottest sauna i 've ever been in			0
the ancient @entity256 ritual is said to feel like returning to the mother 's womb ; the one who cures physical and spiritual ills by separating us from the outside world so we can reconnect with our inner selves			0
the experience involves chants , sweat , invocation , and steam from herbs			0
it 's said to purify and relax the mind and body			0
what happens inside is somewhat secret - which is challenging mentally as well as physically			0
it 's certainly not your usual relaxing massage , but as far as spa experiences go , it 's one of the most rewarding that i 've tried			0
we spent an hour debriefing and talking deeply with the young shaman afterwards			0
a moment of calm by the @entity283 , one of the @entity284 beautiful clothes stalls by @entity286 ( l ) and , of course , colourful ceramic sugar skulls ( r ) on our final day we embarked on a full day excursion to great @entity291 ruin @entity286 - the archeological site that 's home to one of the seven @entity284 , @entity283			1
before our elaborate guided tour we went for a swim in a natural water pool in a stalactite - filled cave known as a cenote			2
afterwards we stopped to visit @entity301 colonial city @entity299 , @entity302 , for a stroll around the main square			2
the @entity291 pyramid is famous for sculptures of plumed serpents running down its sides			1
during the spring and autumn equinoxes , the late afternoon sun casts a series of triangular shadows against the northwest balustrade , creating the illusion of a snake crawling down			0
after witnessing this wonder and hearing of its ancient greatness , indulging in decadent freedom at naked chocolate body painting and going through a moral lesson in the temazcal , i left @entity26 feeling refreshed , enlightened - and definitely braver			0
