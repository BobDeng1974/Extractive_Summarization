the baseball player who lost a staggering amount of weight has piled the pounds back on after discovering he plays worse as a slimmer man			1
the death of his cousin to heart disease inspired @entity7 to lose a massive 17kg between october 2013 and march 2014			1
but the 34 - year - old played poorly and many - including himself - believe his skinny figure could not support his towering six - foot , seven - inch frame			1
so after dropping down to a much healthier 122kg , the @entity12 baseballer has again ballooned to around 136kg			0
before and after : @entity13 ' pitcher @entity7 lost 17kg for the 2014 season ( left ) but piled the pounds back on this year ( pictured ) the struggle : @entity7 ( pictured this year ) says the reason he played worse as a skinny man is because he felt ' off balance ' toning up : @entity7 ( left ) looked in the best shape of his life as he toned up for his wedding to @entity22 ( pictured ) in january last year the @entity13 pitcher looked in the best shape of his life during on his wedding day in january 2014			1
famous for having a more rotund figure , the sportsman showed of his newly toned body in a suit he could not have dreamed of wearing a year before			1
he said : ' i feel like this is a good weight			2
i feel a little stronger			0
i feel my legs under me , being a lot stronger , and being able to push off the mound			0
' the six - time all - star put on around 9kg while recovering from a knee injury , and 5kg more over the winter			1
during his 14 - year - career , he has weighed as much as 142kg but the loss of his cousin in 2012 inspired @entity7 to battle his obesity for fear he would suffer the same fate			1
he said : ' i lost a bunch of weight drastically , pretty quick , two years ago			2
' kind of was off balance and did n't know really how my body was working			2
so just talking to dr. @entity48 and to the trainers , i feel like this is a good weight			0

i feel a little stronger			0
i feel my legs under me , being a lot stronger , and being able to push off the mound ' even a talent spotter noticed the decline in his usually stellar performances when he was a slim pitcher			2
he told the @entity62 : ' the weight loss has created a balance problem for him			2
he 's all over the place			0
' he 's learning how to pitch in that body , a body he 's really never had			0
i do n't think there 's anything wrong with him other than that			0
' sometimes you pitch at a certain weight all your life and then someone has the brilliant idea that you should lose weight because it 's putting stress on your knees , you do it , and then you 're dealing with something else			0
