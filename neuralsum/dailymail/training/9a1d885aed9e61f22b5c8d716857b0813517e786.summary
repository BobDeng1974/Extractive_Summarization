by @entity0 a five - month - old male orangutan has been sent to the @entity2 to try and find a suitable surrogate mother after failing to bond with his real mom			1
@entity5 rejected his birth mother after he was born in january at the @entity7 in @entity8			1
officials there placed the baby primate with a surrogate and chose a female who already had experience in such a role			2
there 's a new orangutan at the @entity2			2
four - month - old @entity5 arrived at the zoo on may 19			1
he came from the @entity7 because he could not bond with his mother			0
@entity20 has an excellent track record with successful orangutans births in the past , but on this occasion , the mother simply did n't want to get to know her offspring			0
@entity26 has raised her own offspring in the past , she experienced a difficult delivery and had shown little interest in caring for the baby			0
the @entity2 ’s keepers and veterinary team worked tirelessly to offer mom @entity33 and the baby private , off - exhibit quarters in @entity7 , in the hopes that they would bond but in the end it was decided he should be moved to @entity41			1
' this baby ’s well - being has been a priority since he was born , and we feel it is of utmost importance that he is raised by one of his own species , ' @entity42 , the @entity2 ’s executive director , said			1
' every orangutan matters ; this is an endangered species that could go extinct in the wild during this baby ’s lifetime			0
' @entity56 was the surrogate mother for @entity58 , a baby orangutan who was brought to @entity41 in 2008			0
a new bond : @entity62 is being moved from the @entity7 zoo to @entity41 where he will be cared for by @entity56 , a surrogate mother			2
( pictured here , baby @entity66 , a gorilla who died last year and his mother @entity69 at @entity2 ) @entity5 is the second baby ape to live at the @entity2 this year			1
the first was a female gorilla named @entity66 who was born in march but also died a month later			0
@entity66 was the first gorilla born in @entity41 in 22 years			0
@entity56 is considered a ' proven surrogate , ' and she and @entity5 slowly have been introduced to each other at the @entity2			1
@entity76 , which means ' little man ' in @entity78 , is in good health and was accompanied to @entity41 by one of his keepers from @entity7 , who has remained at the zoo to work with a @entity41 zookeeper to assist in the transition .			0

@entity5 was born in january at a zoo in @entity8 but his mom rejected him
