@entity1 legend @entity0 believes that the club need to start spending if they want to compete for the title @entity0 wrote on @entity21 : ' the squad they have now is very good , but the signings are important			1
the age of the squad is very good			0
' this summer is going to be so important			2
they will get back to winning stuff			0
' they could overturn @entity28 and @entity29 if they bring in the right players			1
it is time to kick on from last year 's @entity33 win			2
' @entity10 ( left ) and @entity12 both joined the club in the january transfer window @entity1 have repeatedly been linked with a defensive midfielder , including @entity38 's £ 24m - rated @entity37			1
however , @entity0 believes the unexpected rise of @entity40 , who starred in the 2 - 0 away win against @entity28 , will make @entity2 think twice before signing a midfield enforcer			1
the 23 - year - old @entity42 has been featuring regularly for @entity1 ever since the december win over @entity44 , but he is out of contract in the summer			1
@entity40 's ( right ) rise might make @entity2 rethink his plans to sign a defensive midfielder @entity38 's @entity37 has been heavily linked with a move to the @entity50 @entity0 added : ' it is great to see @entity40 play well			1
a lot of the plaudits go to attacking players , but he 's taken his chance very well			2

' @entity1 are currently on a five - match winning streak , including victories over @entity63 and @entity64 in the @entity33			2
@entity67 's ( centre ) form has been mesmerising in the past few weeks for @entity2 's side @entity71 's ( centre ) return to the side has given them a boost and he scored against @entity74 on sunday @entity67 , @entity75 and @entity76 have scored in recent games and so @entity0 believes @entity2 has been dealt with a selection headache in attack			2
@entity0 added : ' at the moment , @entity67 is playing so well that he has to play			0
' if everyone were fit , i would have @entity71 on the left , @entity67 in the middle and @entity76 on the right			0
' @entity87 and @entity88 would be on the bench			0
it is a good problem to have , though			0
' having said this , i like @entity87 's pace and he 's something different to the others			0
' the form of @entity76 , @entity71 and @entity67 is likely to see @entity87 on the bench in upcoming games			0
