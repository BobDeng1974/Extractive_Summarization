photographer @entity7 , 41 , spotted the near - death battle while on board a great white shark tour boat off the coast of @entity12 , @entity13			1
as these amazing photographs show one seal escaped the jaws of death after balancing on the massive sharks nose just inches from rows and rows of razor sharp teeth			1
jaws - dropping moment : the seal leans on the tip of the nose of a great white shark , off the coast of @entity13 the chase is on : the seal narrowly evades being crushed by the jaws of the shark making waves : the seal desperately jumps away from the fearsome predator as the tour group look on heavy - going : great white sharks can tip the scales at @entity38 return journey : photographer @entity40 said the seals were making their way back to @entity43 after feeding when the @entity44 pounced size matters : great white sharks can reach 20ft in length brush with death : the seal must use all its skill if it wants to live make it snappy : the fearsome shark leaps out of the water in a bid to snare its prey @entity7 , 41 , from @entity57 , @entity58 , said ‘ the seals were making their way back to @entity43 after feeding out at sea and the sharks travel below them			1
‘ the sharks are really well camouflaged due to their dark backs and when the seal looks down it is hard to make out the shark in the dark below			2
‘ when the shark picks its time to attack , it can accelerate at around 25mph upwards which can send both the shark and the seal flying up out of the water			2
looking sharp : the shark bears its huge teeth as it chases the petrified seal @entity80 - tastically fast : great white sharks can reach speeds of 25mph as they breach the surface while hunting @entity85 : the @entity4 opens wide - but the seal is still outwitting it hunger games : the shark comes within a whisker of its lunch yet again seal the deal ? not quite , with the shark failing yet again to secure a meal sea - ing is believing : the seal seems destined to be swallowing whole great escape : but then the seal leans on the tip of the nose of the shark before making its bid for freedom ‘ i have seen a shark lose a tooth on a decoy breach before but never when attacking and killing a real seal			0
‘ the breaching sharks are amazing , the speed and agility just takes your breath away as they can explode from below without warning			0
‘ this seal was one lucky pup			0
’ the great white shark is the world 's largest predatory fish - measuring up to 20 foot in length and weighing around 5,000lbs - and can leave the water completely when attacking prey .			0
