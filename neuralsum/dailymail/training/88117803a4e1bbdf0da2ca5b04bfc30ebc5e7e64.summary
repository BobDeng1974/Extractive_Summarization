by @entity0 thousands of patients are being denied the choice of life - saving heart drugs by cash - strapped @entity5 trusts			1
the @entity7 drugs watchdog gave gps the green light two years ago to prescribe new - generation blood - thinners for people with irregular heartbeats at risk of suffering strokes			1
but doctors are defying recommendations from the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , according to a leading charity			2
the @entity19 claims that the bodies that deliver @entity5 treatments are placing restrictions on use of new blood thinner drugs the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) claims that clinical commissioning groups ( @entity26 ) – the bodies that deliver @entity5 treatments – are placing restrictions on use of these new drugs			1
@entity30 , the charity ’s deputy chief executive , said such limits were affecting the quality of life of patients			1
she claimed @entity26 were driven by a fear that the drugs would be ‘ overly expensive and stretch resources ’ , despite being deemed cost - effective by @entity17			1
the new blood - thinners – known as novel oral anti-coagulants ( @entity41 ) – cost about £ 2 a day compared with just £ 1 a month for warfarin , the most commonly used treatment			1
but patients on warfarin need regular monitoring which increases the cost of care			2
new drug : novel oral anti-coagulants cost about £ 2 a day for the @entity5 ‘ we have been told that @entity26 are making it extremely difficult such as imposing a nine - month wait before patients are given an alternative drug , ’ said ms @entity30			1
‘ patients have even said they ’ve been told wrongly that the drugs have n’t been approved			1
‘ trusts in some parts of @entity60 have made it difficult by making @entity8 sign long contracts if they ’re going to prescribe these new drugs			0
this is n’t usual and it limits patient choice			0
’ one doctor , who asked not to be named , told @entity68 he had seen evidence of @entity26 prohibiting the drugs , and the @entity19 claims to have reports of doctors being threatened with fines for prescribing them			0
on its website , @entity75 of @entity76 warns of ‘ cost implications to the @entity5 ’ , stating : ‘ significant numbers of patients changing from warfarin to a @entity41 would			1
lead to the need to limit commissioning of other services ’			0
in @entity85 , the @entity26 says ‘ warfarin remains the agent of choice for most patients ’			0
it denied it was restricting the use of the new drugs , and said clinicians were using them ‘ in line with published @entity17 guidelines ’			2
more than a million patients in the @entity7 suffer the most common heart rhythm disorder – known as atrial fibrillation – and the condition is blamed for causing more than 20,000 strokes a year in this country			0
the most commonly used therapy is warfarin , which is the same chemical used in high doses to kill vermin			0
but patients who take this blood - thinner need regular blood tests to prevent them suffering complications			1
these checks reveal if their blood is clotting too much , which can trigger a stroke , or clotting too little , which increases the risk of internal bleeding			0
@entity17 gave the go - ahead in 2012 for three new thinners – dabigatran , rivaroxaban and apixaban – that promised to revolutionise stroke - prevention			2
they are effective yet do not require the same monitoring			0
however , the @entity7 lags behind the rest of @entity123 when it comes to prescribing them			0
consultant cardiologist @entity126 , from @entity127 , said doctors were failing patients by denying them choice and it should be ‘ automatic ’ that people received the new drugs			2
@entity135 mp @entity134 , who has undergone treatment for an irregular heartbeat himself , claimed take - up of new treatments had been absolutely ‘ abysmal ’			2
a @entity17 spokesman said : ‘ ccgs are legally obliged to fund these new drugs in cases where they ’re clinically appropriate			0

new blood - thinners could save lives , but patients are denied them
charity says the bodies that deliver @entity5 treatments restrict drugs
