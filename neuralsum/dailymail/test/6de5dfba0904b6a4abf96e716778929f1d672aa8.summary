a rare @entity0 which has lain gathering dust for years has been bought for almost four times its estimated value - but still needs a full restoration			2
the 1954 @entity6 was estimated to sell for around £ 200,000 by auctioneers but ended up being sold for £ 739,212 - a record for the auction house			1
originally commissioned by @entity12 racing driver @entity10 and painted in his racing colour of purple - the license plate still bears his initials			0
the 1954 @entity6 ( pictured ) sold for almost four times its estimated value the rare @entity0 needs a full restoration after it was allowed to gather dust in a barn over the past 15 years more than 45 people placing bids on behalf of bidders from around the world in the room , over the phone and on the internet			1
the @entity0 eventually sold a to an anonymous @entity28 car collector - who faces the task of restoring the car to its former glory			1
but when it is ready , it could be worth more than £ 1million - and would prove itself a wise investment for the buyer			1
a strong market and rising prices mean vintage vehicles are increasingly popular as financial investments - and the value of some classic cars rose by 257 per cent between 2005 and 2013 , it was recently reported			1
but when it is ready , it could be worth more than £ 1million - and would prove itself a wise investment for the anonymous @entity28 collector who bought it earlier this week , a clapped out 1962 @entity50 went on the market - offering car fanatics the chance to restore the virtually untouched vehicle - with the promise of being worth three times its £ 220,000 price tag when finished			1
the @entity56 was the second series of post-war @entity0 automobiles , replacing the @entity58			0
it was considered the epitome of @entity28 luxury in the 1950s as well as being the first car to carry the @entity64 nameplate			2
it was the fastest production car of the period as it could reach 120mph			2
but despite its speed capability , the @entity64 model was produced specifically for the domestic market in continental @entity70			0
and despite vehicles having the same uniform style , each car was unique in detail and unlike almost every car of its time , the @entity64 had an all - aluminum body			2
@entity78 , @entity0 's director of royal and vip relations , described the 1954 @entity0 as ' one of the rarest and most iconic cars of its time ' as only 218 were made			1
he also referred to it as ' almost the @entity85 of its day '			0
however , this white model is far from fast after spending the past 15 years gathering dust in a barn			0
when new , the @entity0 was the world 's fastest four - seat car - capable of 120mph			0
this was thanks to a 4.9 - litre engine which developed almost 180bhp - a large figure for a 61 - year - old car			0
@entity97 , director at @entity98 , said the winning bid was ' an absolutely fantastic result '			0
he added : ' a ' lost ' car always attracts collectors ' attention , and when it 's such a rare , iconic and valuable machine , that interest can lead to a frenetic bidding battle such as we saw yesterday			2
' it will be fascinating to see the ' journey ' the @entity0 now takes , as its restoration commences			0
' this virtually - untouched 1962 @entity50 went on the market for £ 220,000 will be worth three times the price if fully restored			1

the @entity6 was expected to sell for £ 200,000
but an anonymous car collector bought it for £ 739,212 in @entity116 yesterday
when the vintage car is restored , it could be worth more than £ 1million
described as ' one of the rarest cars of its time ' as only 218 cars were made
