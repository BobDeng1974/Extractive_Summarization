by @entity0 published : 05:13 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 16:34 est , 5 april 2013 ' @entity1 ' : @entity2 says he spent four months in a cast after a 4am callout a police officer is suing a burglary victim for £ 10,000 after allegedly falling into a drain while investigating a break - in			1
@entity10 @entity9 says he tore an achilles tendon and spent four months in a cast after the fall during a 4am call - out to the man 's shop in march last year			1
the 34 - year - old officer is now suing owner @entity18 for ' loss of overtime ' during his six - month absence from work – despite being on full pay throughout this time			1
a letter from @entity2 's lawyers adds that the officer also missed out on special duties during the @entity27 – something which came as a ' bitter disappointment ' to him			2
mr @entity18 said : ' i was in complete shock when i received the letter last month			2
' i wo n't be calling the police any more			2
i do n't see the point			2
not if there 's a danger of getting sued			1
it should not be allowed			2
' the claim emerges just days after @entity39 sparked public outrage and was criticised by her own chief constable for suing a burglary victim for £ 50,000			1
she claims she injured her leg and wrist after tripping over a kerb while investigating at a petrol station in @entity47 , @entity48			1
mr @entity18 , 36 , who owns @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 , branded @entity2 's action , which is expected to seek £ 10,000 , as ' disgusting '			1
he added : ' he has signed up to be a police officer , he knows there is some risk involved			0
' it 's ridiculous and disgusting that a copper should think it is okay to sue someone who has called him for help			0
' @entity62 in @entity50 is being sued a year after a police officer investigating a burglary at the premises claimed he fell on an uncovered manhole cover			1
owner @entity18 is pictured with a solicitor 's letter legal documents sent to the centre informing them that they are to be sued last night @entity51 police chief constable @entity72 said the force did not support @entity2 's action and would investigate			1
she added the ' vast majority ' of her officers would ' never consider making a private compensation claim against a victim of crime '			1
mr @entity18 , who has been in the aquatics business for more than 20 years , said the burglary , in which his safe was broken into and property damaged , has already cost him more than £ 2,000 in losses and repairs			0
' we had a number of break - ins around that period and each time the police did n't catch anyone , ' he added			0
' on this occasion , again no one was caught and instead i 've been landed with this			0
he said he does not even know where @entity95 fell and said officers had arrived at the property before him after responding to an automatic alarm			0
he said : ' i saw him attempt to climb over the fence to get in			0
i saw that @entity2 was hobbling a bit			0
but he did n't mention falling into a drain or a manhole			0
' if he wants to try to climb over a fence then that 's his business			0
the whole claim is ridiculous			1
' @entity2 's lawyers , @entity109 - based @entity108 , claim mr @entity18 's business exposed him to a ' foreseeable risk '			1
their letter states : ' our client fell into an open downpipe drain which was not covered at the time			0
it was extremely dark and our client did n't see the opening			0
' it was not possible to reach @entity2 , who lives in @entity120 , @entity121 , for comment last night but on thursday he confirmed he had launched the action , adding : ' i 'm waiting to hear something back			0
' another lawsuit : @entity39 , left , has instructed solicitors to take action against petrol station owner @entity129 , right , for ' failing to ensure ' her safety during a routine break - in investigation @entity132 said it had supported his recovery and rehabilitation through its occupational health department since he was injured on march 28 last year			1
it confirmed he remained on full pay and had returned to full duties since september			0
chief constable @entity72 said : ' this is a private claim made by an officer and is not supported or funded by the force			1
' as well as receiving treatment at a charity - funded police convalescent home and an @entity148 hospital , @entity2 's lawyers claim he needed private chiropractic treatment			2
in a joint statement with the @entity151 they said : ' it is entirely wrong officers who sustain injuries through no fault of their own whilst trying to protect the public should be singled out in this way			0
' it is estimated that police officers pocket £ 20million a year in personal injury claims .			2

@entity10 claims he tore @entity164 in fall at @entity165 in @entity51
he wants compensation for six months ' worth of lost overtime earnings
claim emerges days after @entity172 sued petrol station for tripping over a kerb
