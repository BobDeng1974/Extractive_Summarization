in march 2009 , mr @entity5 , who then ran a contract cleaning firm , was involved in a botched bid to take over non-league @entity49			1
he had hoped to save the then - financially embattled south coast club , but pulled out of a planned deal at the last minute after getting ' cold feet ' and suffering a minor stroke			1
the club 's director @entity54 said at the time : ' mr @entity5 clearly got cold feet			1
he did have a bit of money and being a major football fan he thought he could help the club			0
' however , he has spent too long in @entity49 and , through speaking to people , heard so much bitterness he got scared			2
' one of the club 's players later commented that a meeting with mr @entity5 seemed to be the first time the ' prospective owner ' had eaten in a restaurant , as he asked for explanations of dishes on the menu			1
at one pointed in the doomed deal , mr @entity5 reportedly produced a cheque for £ 300,000 that contained spelling mistakes and had @entity76 marks on it			1

' it is believed mr @entity5 has made two emotionally - charged appearances on the @entity15 show			1
the first was in 2011 , when he made an appearance in a segment entitled : ' i 'm your husband 's mistress and i 'll prove i 'm not cheating on him			0
' he reportedly admitted he failed a lie detector test regarding his affair and at times shouted at host @entity15 , repeating that ' we all make mistakes '			2
mr @entity5 's son said he and his biological father appeared on the show last year , when a paternity test proved he was his father			1
but , his son said , ' he still did n't want anything to do with me '			0
the revelations came after mr @entity5 , 45 , caused outrage this week when he appeared on @entity23 documentary benefits : too fat to work , in which he told of his £ 3,000 taxpayer - funded wedding to @entity9 , 43			1
mr @entity5 ca n't stand up for more than a few minutes at a time and relies on a council carer to get washed the couple 's big day – which saw £ 1,000 spent on catering , including £ 450 for their favourite kebab takeaway for the evening buffet – was paid for almost entirely from benefits			1
mr @entity5 , who weighs 31st , had to have a suit specially made for the occasion			2
by contrast his 23st wife became a bride for the first time and wore a white gown for the register office ceremony and church blessing that followed			0
their 50 guests were treated to a three - course meal at the reception , followed later by the buffet			0
viewers were shown how paramedics were called to the reception in @entity31 , @entity32 , before mr @entity5 was taken to hospital feeling unwell			2
mr @entity5 , who suffers from type 2 diabetes , hypertension and other problems linked to his weight , had a blood clot on the lung and instead of a honeymoon he spent nine days in hospital			2
he can only stand for a limited period before becoming breathless and his wife said the wedding day trip to hospital was no surprise			0
mrs @entity164 , who has not had a job during her adult life , said : ' i reckon @entity20 will be on benefits for most of his life			0
' mr @entity5 used to run a cleaning business and had to give up work six years ago following a stroke			1
producers followed them as they organised the ceremony - including canapes and a buffet provided by their favourite kebab shop despite being jobless and on a weight management course , the couple can be seen treating themselves to kebabs after they went to a weigh in and realised they had lost a few pounds			0
the takeaway cost almost £ 12 interviewed about his benefits on the documentary , he said : ' is it right ? of course not			0
but at the end of the day i did work			0
i have worked , i have n't sat on my a * * * all the time			0
i have done some work and so really , why not ? ' the couple receive around £ 1,700 a month in benefits			0
the rent on their one - bedroom flat is paid for by the taxpayer , and a carer comes twice daily to clean and help mr @entity5 dress , but the taxpayer pays the £ 8,000 - a - year cost			1
mr @entity5 also uses a specially strengthened mobility scooter , provided at public expense			2
he insists he wants a job but says no one will give him work because of his weight			0
he blamed the government for being too generous to those on benefits			2
speaking on @entity215 's @entity214 programme , mr @entity5 said : ' the government is making it easy for @entity218			1
the government is making it easy for people on benefits			0
' he said he did n't think he deserved anything , adding : ' i 'm the one who put myself in this situation , no one else			0
' however , he insisted he was now suffering from ' prejudice '			0
he said he recently applied for an office job but claims he was turned down because he was too overweight			0
it is believed the couple are currently at a ' boot camp ' to lose weight			0
he also told host @entity234 that he did not always eat kebabs , and that off camera he and his wife were eating ' healthy food '			0
