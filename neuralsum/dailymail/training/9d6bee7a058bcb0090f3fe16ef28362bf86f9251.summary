by @entity0 published : 10:09 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 26 february 2013 shoppers are unwittingly buying own brand supermarket foods high in salt , sugar and fat , an expert has warned a leading consumer activist has named and shamed the supermarkets guilty of confusing shoppers with unclear labelling			1
@entity11 says shoppers are unwittingly buying own brand supermarket foods high in salt , sugar and fat because the information is being hidden from them			1
as a result , they may be compromising their health without even realising			0
he told @entity19 : ' it 's easier said than done when it comes to making an informed choice on the content of salt , saturated fat and sugar in pre-packed food on our supermarket shelves			1
at worst , nutritional values are not there at all ! ' others appear not to be there , but they 're hiding under the outer label that you have to peel off to find them , or you require a magnifying glass to read them			0
' a common trick is displaying salt as sodium , which is a lower figure and therefore appears to be healthier			2
mr @entity11 , who runs the website and consumer barcode scanning app @entity44 ( www.canieatit.co.uk ) , added : ' just remember that 1g of @entity46 is equal to 2.5g of salt , that sugar can be labelled as ' carbohydrate ' and saturated fat just as fat			1
' obesity , heart disease and type 2 diabetes are all on the increase – supermarkets should remember that when they are leaving off the sugar , saturated fat and salt values			1
' at can i eat it we help the shoppers by adding nutritional values of a similar product to our app when the product ’s packet or the website or does not			2
' here , from worst to best , he names and shames the worst offenders when it comes to food labelling and then praises those that are the clearest ... @entity76 @entity76 is the worst when it comes to clear nutrition labelling			1
the labels are easy to read , but they insist on ‘ sodium , ’ so you have to multiply it by 2.5 to get the salt level			2
why ? are they frightened that shoppers and surfers wo n’t buy their products if they know the salt level ? i have not found a shopper yet who knows that you have multiply the sodium level by 2.5 to get the salt value			1
not helpful if you are watching your salt intake			2
@entity76 does not have any excuses for being bottom of the pile – they control their website and their labelling			2
a spokesperson for @entity76 said : ' we are committed to clear and open nutritional labelling			1
we are legally obliged to give a measure for sodium - but we also give a salt value on the vast majority of products			2
' @entity108 @entity108 ’s pre-packed products that have been packaged in the @entity110 , are as good as any on the shelves			1
these labels display easy to read nutritional values per 100g or 100ml			0
but the products that are produced in @entity115 have impossible - to - read multi-language labels and some have no nutritional values at all , such as the @entity119 , @entity120 , which has a very high salt content			1
yes , @entity108 has 5,000 plus stores throughout @entity115 , but so do @entity123 – and they manage to produce clear , easy to read nutritional labels on their products sold in their @entity110 stores			1
@entity108 was criticised for a lack of labelling on high - salt products such as smoked salmon , while @entity130 lists the salt in butter as a percentage , which can be misleading @entity134 most products have nutritional information on their website , but like @entity76 they choose not to display the salt - does profit come before their shopper ’s health ? however , www.ocado.com has more and better nutritional information than @entity144 @entity145 most items are well - labelled but occasionally , nutritional values are given per slice , per biscuit or per portion - when the norm is to provide nutritional information per 100g or 100ml as well			1
adding nutritional information per 100g to all their products would help			2
@entity130 i 'd say 99 per cent of @entity130 ’s nutritional labelling is excellent			2
however , when space is limited they do use double labelling - where one label is under the other			0
this is a growing habit by producers to use double or piled up labels on their products to cut down the space needed for all the information required these days			0
@entity165 is a high profile example , where you need peel back one label to reveal the nutritional values underneath			0
this is rather time - consuming when you 're browsing in a shop			0
@entity171 again , 99 per cent of the nutritional labelling is excellent , but occasionally , we have found that some products have the nutritional values listed by their percentage			0
for example , a pack of @entity179 butter is labelled as having 2 per cent salt			0
it may seem just a pinch , but that 2 per cent translates into two grams per 100g , which shoots it straight into the high ' red ' traffic light zone			0
however @entity179 ’s are on the right track , and their website has more products displaying nutritional values per 100g or 100ml than @entity145			0
mr @entity11 praised the co-operative for listing the ingredients even in their alcoholic drinks @entity194 all @entity194 own - branded products we checked had easy - to - read labels and displayed salt , sugar and saturated fat			1
adding the ingredients and nutritional values for their alcoholic drinks would be a real plus ! @entity123 @entity123 has clean and easy - to - read nutritional labelling that leaves you in no doubt how much salt , saturated fat or sugar is in the product			1
the store has shown that you can be no - frills supermarket and package products with easy to digest nutritional values that enable their shoppers to make a more informed choice so that they and their family can eat more healthily			1
@entity219 @entity219 ’s nutritional labelling is excellent on their products and their website			0
only the occasional baking or cake decoration product lacks nutritional values , but this is the norm for these products			0
if @entity219 could extend their nutritional and ingredient information to cover their alcoholic drinks – they would be challenging for the top spot			0
the winner : the co-operative this store has clean and easy - to - read nutritional labelling that leaves you in no doubt how much salt , saturated fat or sugar that ’s in the product			1
supermarkets and big brand producers should not wait for health ministers and institutes to wave the big - stick for them to change			0
the co-operative has even started listing the ingredients in their alcoholic drinks , even though it 's not a requirement at the moment			0
all supermarkets should follow their lead .			0

@entity11 says shoppers are buying own brand supermarket foods high in salt , sugar and fat because information is being hidden from them
he has rated the co-operative as the best for clear , honest labelling
but @entity108 and @entity134 also get poor scores for missing information
