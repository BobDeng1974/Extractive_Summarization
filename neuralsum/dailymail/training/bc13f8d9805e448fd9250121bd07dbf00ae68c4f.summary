@entity0 has come to the aid of @entity2 and will stage the @entity4 round of @entity5 for the next two years			1

that was despite the fact construction work had yet to commence on the troubled facility at @entity18			0
the @entity4 @entity5 in the @entity5 championship was left in turmoil after @entity21 pulled out of hosting the 2015 race			1
@entity23 is the start of the 2014 @entity5 which took place at @entity0 with ongoing difficulties regarding planning , @entity9 bosses turned to @entity21 initially to host the 2015 gp , much to @entity0 's dismay			1
but on tuesday , @entity21 chiefs withdrew from the opportunity to play host after neither party could agree terms to form a legal contract			0
@entity21 , which last hosted @entity5 in 2009 , claimed difficulties arose with @entity9 regarding funding arrangements to help them stage the event			1

' i welcomed the opportunity to meet with both @entity11 and the @entity2 recently so we could try and find a way to keep @entity5 in the @entity4 and racing at @entity0			1
' two - wheel racing is as much a part of @entity0 's heritage as four - wheel racing and i am obviously delighted to be in a position to announce we are hosting both the @entity71 and @entity72 in 2015			0
' we have recently introduced a family - friendly pricing policy for the @entity71 @entity4 @entity5 which is proving extremely popular			2
' over the next two weeks i will be working closely with my team at @entity0 to launch a ticket model for @entity5 i hope will be equally well received by fans			2
' regarding the two - year deal , @entity9 chief executive @entity77 has expressed his gratitude to @entity0 for stepping into the breach			2
the @entity4 round of the @entity5 calendar for the next two years will be held at @entity0 ' we want to thank the new management at @entity0 , our partners at @entity11 and our investors for the rapid response needed to support the 2015 event when it became clear we would be unlikely to conclude the contractual arrangements at @entity21 , ' said @entity77			1
' we are delighted to secure the future of the event for the next two years while our circuit in @entity94 is under construction			0
