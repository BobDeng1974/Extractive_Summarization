a man who almost died when he fell 110ft from a @entity2 castle as a teenager has spoken of his miraculous recovery			2
doctors were ready to switch off life support for @entity7 , who slipped while playing on the ramparts of @entity9 in @entity10 aged 13			1
he plunged from the stone tower , which stands on the edge of a cliff , and landed on the beach below			2
miracle : @entity7 , pictured on his hospital bed in 2003 , was given a 10 per cent chance of survival after plunging from @entity9 in @entity10 plunge : mr @entity7 was playing on @entity9 in @entity10 , pictured , when he fell from the walls down onto the beach below mr @entity7 lost huge amounts of blood , suffered massive head trauma and was left with shattered knee bones protruding from his legs			1
he was given a 10 per cent chance of survival , and hospital staff went as far as inviting relatives to say their final goodbyes			1
but , miraculously , mr @entity7 , now 23 , lifted his arm after after all hope had faded , convincing surgeons that he had a chance of living through surgery			1
although his injuries have left him with limited vision , partial paralysis and epilepsy , he can now speak of his bravery nearly 10 years after the accident			1
he said : ' i 've no memory of the day so have to rely on eyewitnesses - the castle is just a short walk from my house in @entity50 and me and my friends used to play there all the time			2
' back from the brink : mr @entity7 , now 23 , was left disabled after his unlikely recovery , but is now strong enough to inspire others ' when i walk past it now , it helps me think about how far i 've come , rather than what happened there			1
' the doctors said , " if this boy wants to fight , then we 'll fight too "			2
but the outlook was initially bleak after he was plucked from the beach by an air ambulance and flown urgently to @entity66			0
when his mother @entity68 arrived with family to see mr @entity7 , they were worryingly taken straight to the relatives ' room			1
she said : ' i 'm a health visitor nurse , so i knew that was n't good			0
they gave him less than a 10 per cent chance of survival			1
' he was moved to @entity78 's @entity77 where , 48 hours later , they said he was n't compatible with life and were going to switch off the life support machine			0
we were told to go in and say our last goodbyes			0
' eventually , only mrs @entity84 was left - and was shocked when she entered the room to find her son missing			1
but happily , it was because doctors had seen him move and decided to operate rather than let him die			0
return : mr @entity7 has no memory of the accident itself , but says visiting @entity9 only reminds him how far he has come mr @entity7 spent nearly four weeks in a coma and the swelling in his head was so bad that half of his skull was removed for 11 weeks to ease the pressure			1
he spent another eight months in hospital , where he caught @entity101 and septicaemia , but pulled through			0
now mr @entity7 is positive about the future , having just completed a 20 - mile cycle ride to raise money for charity			1
he said : ' i may never be able to drive a bus or fly a plane , but i like to focus on what i can do rather than what i ca n't			0
' and i want to inspire people in the same situation as myself and try to help others with their disabilities and impairments			0
' ' i 've gone from being a boy who was an inch from death to a man who strives to achieve and inspire			0
' the trauma of the accident transformed me			0
my dad and i used to cycle on the islands when i was younger - the route was 20 miles long and i was determined to complete it			2
