fighter pilots flying the deadly @entity2 jet have very special secret weapon - a $ 400,000 helmet that allows them to see through the plane			1
six infrared cameras mounted around the aircraft allow its pilots to ' look through ' the air - frame , giving them a perfect 360 degree view of their surroundings and enemies			1
and all of the information they need to complete their mission - airspeed , altitude and even warnings systems - are projected straight onto the helmet 's visor rather than the traditional ' heads - up display '			1
@entity63 added : ' you can look through the jet 's eyeballs to see the world as the jet sees the world			0
' like the jet - which is estimated to cost around $ 1.5trillion to develop over the next 50 years - the helmet is incredibly expensive			2
each custom - made piece of high - tech headgear costs nearly half a million dollars , which is reportedly millions over its original budget due to development problems			1
earlier versions of the helmet did not deal well with turbulence and there was a delay in the state - of - the - art video system which caused motion sickness , the @entity62 reports			1
there was also a green glow in the night vision function that obscured the pilots ' vision and in 2011 , the @entity86 allegedly hired @entity87 to build a backup			0
the @entity2 has what is considered to be ' one of the most complicated weapons systems ever '			1
whereas a fighter jet like the @entity51 is programmed with around 1.7 million lines of software code , the @entity2 has up to a staggering 8 million			1
it comes in three versions , including one that is designed to take off and land on an aircraft carrier and another that lands vertically like a harrier jet			0
trouble : earlier versions of the helmet did not deal well with turbulence and there was a delay in the state - of - the - art video system which caused motion sickness state - of - the - art : the information which would usually be on the ' heads - up display ' - airspeed , altitude and even warnings systems - is projected straight onto the helmet 's visor joint attack : the helmet is so advanced that it allows pilots to share information with other f - 35 jets nearby military force : the @entity124 government estimated the @entity2 would cost around $ 1.5trillion to develop over the next 50 years the helmet incredibly allows pilots to share information with other @entity2 's near it but that function has also had teething problems , the program 's executive officer			1
air force lt. gen. @entity132 said : ' if one or two jets are flying together , they have been able to share information seamlessly			1
' but when there are four jets , communication problems emerge , which can ' create an inaccurate picture for the pilot			2
' the @entity86 's astonishing estimate for the lifetime cost an @entity2 is up almost $ 120billion from about year ago			2
but it still plans to buy 2,443 of the warplanes that can evade radar detection and can reach well over supersonic speed			0
the new estimate includes maintenance costs of around $ 1.1trillion over the plane 's lifetime , the price of the aircraft itself which is $ 332billion and another $ 63.8billion for the engine			0
the fighter jet 's developers @entity55 say ' the supersonic , multi-role @entity2 represents a quantum leap ' in airborne warfare			2
its ' advanced stealth ' allows it to fly over areas without being detected by sophisticated radar systems that other jets can not			0
its constructors claim it can be used for a range of missions which include air - to - air combat , ground strikes , electronic attack and even reconnaissance because it is such a versatile machine			0
its ' advanced electronic warfare ' function allow it to locate and track enemy forces and even jam their radars			0
the state - of - the - art helmet - which costs $ 400,000 - give the pilot real - time access to battle space information with 360 - degree coverage of their surroundings			1
the @entity2 â€™s stealth capabilities and ability to carry weapons inside it 's airframe mean it can engage its targets from long - range without being detected			2
@entity55 says the @entity2 ' will enter the battlespace first , clearing the way ' for coalition forces			0
the company describes it as the ' quarterback ' for a joint strike force because it can share what it sees with other jets nearby , expanding the ' situational awareness across the entire network of aircraft ' .			0

six infrared cameras around the jet give pilots a complete 360 degree view
its price tag is millions over original budget due to development problems
state - of - the - art helmet allows pilot to share information with nearby f - *35s*
@entity2 one of the most complicated weapons systems ever built
programmed with over 8 million lines of code , four times more than @entity51
