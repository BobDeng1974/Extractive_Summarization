by @entity0 a @entity2 congressional candidate in @entity3 has changed his name to @entity5 in an effort to elicit support from his largely @entity9 district			1
@entity5 , whose birth name was @entity11 , has previously run in two other political campaigns in @entity3 - both times as a @entity14 - but lost each time			1
so he took a different tact and the @entity16 reports that he petitioned the state superior court to change his name to the same one as the famed civil rights activist this past november			0
bending to the audience : @entity11 ( pictured ) changed his name in november to @entity5 and has since changed his political alliance from @entity14 to @entity2 as he runs for congressional office in the official paperwork , 34 - year - old @entity11 wrote that he ' experienced many hardships because of my name '			1
namesake : in his application , @entity11 said that he ' experienced hardships because of his name ' and did not mention the famed labor leader ( pictured ) after paying the required $ 319 fee , the name change was approved but that was the only form of reinvention that he launched ahead of his latest campaign			1
@entity11 ran as a @entity14 write in candidate against congressman @entity36 in 2012 and as a @entity14 city council candidate in @entity38 in 2013			2
but in february of this year , the newly - renamed @entity5 filed his campaign registration as a @entity40 in his attempt to replace 70 - year - old @entity2 representative pastor , who announced that he will not be seeking re-election this year			1
' people want a name that they can feel comfortable with , ' @entity5 explained to the @entity46			0
' if you went out there running for office and your name was @entity51 , you 'd probably be screwed			0
' it 's almost as simple as saying @entity53 is running for president ... you would n't forget it , would you ? ' @entity5 's own personal history - as an unemployed military veteran with a @entity58 named king - bears little resemblance to his namesake , who started as a farm worker and later became one of the most recognizable labor leaders in the country			2
he told the @entity46 that he views the two @entity9 candidates as his top competition in the race but feels that he has the edge , publicity wise , due to his name : so much so , that he has even stopped taking press requests for the time being			0
false advertising : the newly - named @entity5 's website has pictures of crowds of @entity79 supporters of @entity80 on the background ' there is just simply not enough @entity5 to go around , ' he told the @entity16			0
when that day comes , questions have to be screened and can only be five words long			0
his online campaign presence is not even his own , as the congressional campaign 's website uses photos of hoards of @entity5 supporters at an undated rally , but those individuals were showing their allegiance to @entity79 leader @entity80 and not the candidate in @entity3 .			2

a man whose birth name was @entity11 is now running for @entity98 under his new name @entity5
@entity11 , 34 , applied for the legal name change in november telling how he ' experienced many hardships ' because of his birth name
previously ran for two different elected positions in @entity3 as a @entity14 but , after changing his name , changed his party to @entity40
is trying to appeal to @entity9 *voters* in the district the @entity2 representative @entity36 will leave when he *retires* this fall
