he was able to make an appointment with his doctor for the next evening but collapsed and died in @entity33 , @entity34 , earlier that day			1
an inquest at @entity33 @entity36 in may concluded there had been a failure by the nurse to refer mr @entity8 for emergency care which resulted in a lost opportunity for him to receive necessary treatment			1

she said : ' i knew @entity8 must be feeling very unwell for him to take himself to hospital as he was never one to make a fuss			2
' i was relieved when he phoned to say he had been seen as i thought at least now he was in safe hands			0
' to hear at the inquest that more could have been done to help him was very difficult to comprehend and i ’m still struggling to come to terms with it now			0
' i ca n’t understand why the emergency nurse allowed @entity8 to go home , it seems like common sense to me , that someone with central chest pains requires urgent treatment			1
' i believe that the nurse was too reliant on a poorly drafted protocol			0
' @entity8 was so full of life and a devoted husband and father			2
' sent home : @entity8 was pronounced dead after he was found slumped in his car last year mr @entity8 , who worked as a manager for a large garden centre company , had suffered with high blood pressure and high cholesterol for some time			1

he decided to go to hospital on november 28 after the chest pains , which would occur approximately every 30 minutes , came on particularly strong as he drove to work			0
at his inquest , senior coroner for @entity33 @entity82 recommended that @entity84 implement a revised ‘ @entity88 ’ for patients with chest pain to ensure they received emergency care			2
shortly after the death , the @entity84 commenced a ‘ @entity91 ’ to ensure that lessons were learned			0
the investigation highlighted that they required more explicit protocols in place to ensure that adults with chest pains were treated appropriately			0
the @entity84 has now confirmed it has revised its ‘ @entity88 ’ for patients with chest pains to prevent further deaths			0
mrs @entity16 now wants the protocol to be implemented in all community hospitals nationwide to ensure all patients with chest pains have access to the appropriate treatment as quickly as possible			2
' it gives me some peace of mind to know that the @entity84 has revised and implemented its protocol , as encouraged by the coroner , but it wo n’t bring @entity8 back ' @entity16 , @entity8 's husband mrs @entity16 , his wife of 11 - years , who is also the mother to two of @entity8 ’s children aged 18 and 11 , said : ' it gives me some peace of mind to know that the @entity84 has revised and implemented its protocol , as encouraged by the coroner , but it wo n’t bring @entity8 back			1

' @entity128 , a medical law expert at @entity130 lawyers , which is representing mr @entity8 's family , said : ' this is a tragic case that has left @entity45 struggling to come to terms with the loss of her husband and three children without their dad			1
' we are pleased that the @entity84 has now implemented a revised protocol for adults presenting with chest pains , albeit too late for @entity8			2
@entity8 stopped off at the minor injuries unit at @entity12 the day before he died ' we will now continue to investigate on @entity45 ’s behalf , whether @entity8 would not have died if he had received emergency treatment			1
' we are also looking to secure the family financial security for the future ; given @entity8 was the main breadwinner			0
' the @entity17 must continually strive to learn lessons from any shortcomings and make improvements to its services as a whole to provide the best possible care			0
' we believe that the revised " @entity88 " should be implemented nationwide , in all @entity154 , so that every adult patient with chest pains who might present at such a centre is safeguarded and referred for specialist treatment that could save their life			0
