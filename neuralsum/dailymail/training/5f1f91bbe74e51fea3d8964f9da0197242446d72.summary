cold case solved : @entity9 says he got away with the murder of his 3 - year - old son @entity12 for 31 years			2
the 57 - year - old was charged with the 1983 slaying on tuesday after @entity9 finally confessed shallow grave : here , @entity26 detective @entity25 starts a second hole during the search for the remains of @entity30 in @entity1 in 2011 after @entity9 drove his @entity31 , along with the body of the wife he stabbed , to a @entity11 police station and confessed			1
the confession suggested to police that @entity9 may have also killed his son who went missing in 1983 , but his confession would n't come for 3 years it was a family the father and son had met while fishing that january day , @entity39 told police , who he believed kidnapped the boy			2
police never found a family matching the description @entity39 gave , and he remained a suspect himself , but a body was never found and @entity39 would quietly slip out of @entity1 by the following year			0
his shadow would never again darken the @entity50 and nearly 30 years would pass before police got a break in the heartbreaking case			0
fast - forward to 2011 , and a glimmer of that break would finally come as detective @entity55 of the @entity57 's @entity56 reviewed the case			0
@entity55 chose to reopen the case when he found inconsistencies in @entity9 's statements to police , according to a @entity63 release			2
@entity55 tracked @entity9 to @entity11 , where he was in prison for manslaughter after stabbing to death his wife -- not @entity12 's mother -- and driving around with her body in the car until confessing in a nearby police station			1

he eventually confessed that he killed @entity12 , but covered up that crime for fear of being labeled a ' child killer ' in prison 31 - year - old cold case : it was eventually @entity84 's confession from a @entity11 prison , where he 's serving time for murdering his wife -- who was not @entity12 's mother -- and not a discovery of a body that led authorities to finally charge @entity84			1
@entity12 's remains were never found the 2011 murder of @entity93 is likely what spurred @entity1 police to reopen @entity12 's ice cold case			1
@entity55 would hear several more versions of @entity9 's story before hearing the jarring truth , according to @entity100			0
@entity9 said he simply ' lost it ' while feeding his fussy son in a high chair and a backhanded slap was all it took to leave @entity12 lifeless on the floor			0
so why did n't @entity9 's guilt get the best of him then , as it did when he 'd later kill his wife ? he told police he was more afraid of being labeled in prison as a ' child killer			2
' soon , though , he 'll likely be labeled that in spite of himself			0
' this is another success for the @entity56 , ' said prosecutor @entity115			0
' justice matters , no matter how long it takes			0
' a warrant has been issued for his return to @entity1 , where he 'll answer to a manslaughter charge in the first degree for taking the life of his own son			0
truth emerging : back in 1983 , @entity9 told police that a family he 'd met while fishing with @entity12 here at @entity130 were likely the missing boys kidnappers			2
in fact , @entity9 now says he 'd killed the boy and buried him here in a shallow grave dreamed up : pictured are sketches of the likely fictional family that @entity9 told police in 1983 had likely kidnapped @entity12 during their father - son fishing trip			1

investigators *re-opened* the cold case in 2011 after discovering *discrepancies* in @entity9 's *initial* statements
@entity9 was tracked to a @entity11 prison , where he 's *incarcerated* for stabbing to death his wife , who was not @entity12 's mother
@entity9 told police he killed @entity12 because he was being fussy and then buried him in a shallow waterside grave
