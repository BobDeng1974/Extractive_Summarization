by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:09 est , 7 december 2012 updated : 20:00 est , 7 december 2012 new laws may be needed to ‘ civilise the internet ’ , protect private lives and prevent ‘ mob rule ’ , @entity2 has suggested			1
the judge , speaking in public for the first time since his 2,000 - page report into the @entity11 was published , launched a broadside against the prospect of people facing ‘ trial by @entity16 ’			1
critics have suggested that the @entity2 report ’s recommendations risk shackling a shrinking print media while doing nothing to address a ‘ @entity22 ’ online culture in which innocent people ’s reputations are trashed every day			2
speaker : during a £ 620 - per - ticket lecture in @entity29 last night @entity2 said ' mob rule ' online needed to be dealt with speech : lord @entity2 said that the internet had become a ' megaphone for gossip ' that would need new laws to control it only one short chapter of the report tackles ‘ alternative news sources ’ , including broadcasters and the internet			1
only one - and - a - half pages are devoted to issues of ‘ enforcement ’ raised by the web			0
@entity2 said there was a perception ‘ on the internet that actions do not have legal consequences ’ , unlike newspapers which must follow the rules			0
one of the abuses he mentioned was the publication of topless photos of the @entity56 in a @entity58 magazine , which were not printed in the @entity60 press but could be easily viewed online			0
' unmissable ' : @entity2 was among a host of experts to speak at the day - long symposium , billed as ' one of the key privacy events of the year ' example : a hoax phone call to @entity56 's bedside ( pictured leaving hospital ) was an example of the need for new privacy laws , @entity2 said @entity2 was the keynote speaker at a conference on privacy and the internet in @entity76 , where he travelled soon after the publication of his report last week			1
pressure : @entity2 has been criticised for the lack of detail on his 2,000 page report on how to deal with the internet he told guests paying £ 620 each that he was monitoring developments in @entity87 ‘ with interest ’ but refused to comment any further on his most contentious recommendation for a new watchdog to be underpinned by law			1
however , he did finally address the problems posed by the internet , which he called a ‘ global megaphone for gossip ’ , saying online allegations cause ‘ permanent ’ damage as they remain in cyberspace			2
the judge suggested there was ‘ an element of mob rule ’ – seemingly referring to false allegations against @entity107 peer @entity105 that emerged following a report on the @entity111 ’s @entity110 programme			2
‘ the established media broadly conforms to the law and , when they do not , they are potentially liable under the law , ’ he said			0
‘ in so far as the internet is concerned , there has been – and for many there remains – a perception that actions do not have legal consequences			0
' there is not only a danger of trial by @entity16 , but also of an unending punishment , and no prospect of rehabilitation , by @entity127			1
’ his remarks , at the @entity128 in @entity29 , came as newspaper editors announced they had agreed to put in place the broad principles of his report for a tough new regulator , with the power to issue fines of up to £ 1million , order the publication of prominent apologies and investigate alleged wrongdoing – but without involving statute			0
anticipation : @entity2 delivered his long awaited report on media standards last thursday			0

radio prank on @entity56 proves need for new privacy laws , @entity2 said during £ 620 - per - ticket @entity29 lecture
he was speaking at an *exclusive* event where he said ' mob rule ' online must end
' there is not only a danger of trial by @entity16 , but also of an unending punishment , and no prospect of rehabilitation , via @entity127 , ’ judge added
he said @entity105 case proved internet is ' megaphone for gossip '
