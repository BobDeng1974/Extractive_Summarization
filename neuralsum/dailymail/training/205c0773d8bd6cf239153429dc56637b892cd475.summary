there 's something quite remarkable happening down at @entity2 this season			2
it 's newsworthy enough that a team on a shoestring budget with a little - known manager and no household names are second in the @entity10 table			1
but a look at the ages of @entity14 's players reveals the magnitude of their achievement so far			1
saturday 's 2 - 1 win at pre-season promotion favourites @entity19 saw @entity14 name a side with an average age of just 21.9			1
wing back @entity22 ( centre ) is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring at @entity19 on saturday to put that in context : the youngest player in @entity29 's matchday squad against @entity30 on saturday was @entity31 at 23			1
at 28 , common wisdom has it that @entity34 is in the prime of his career , yet the @entity2 striker must feel like a veteran among @entity14 's kids			1
his next - youngest team - mate is @entity41 , 24			0
in fact , of the 24 players @entity14 has used in all competitions this season , only three are above the age of 23			1
@entity14 is best remembered for his ill - fated spell at @entity49 in the 2009 - 10 season			2
he won just one of 13 games in the @entity53 and was soon back in non-league , where he had made his name with @entity57 , and seemingly on the managerial scrapheap			0
@entity59 gave the 45 - year - old an unlikely second bite at the cherry in @entity63 management , albeit in a caretaker role , when @entity65 resigned as @entity2 manager in july 2013			2
ex-peterborough manager @entity14 has rebuilt his reputation at @entity2 in the last 14 months @entity68 , defender , 23 versatile club captain already pushing 100 first - team appearances			1
@entity71 , goalkeeper , 23 infamously subbed by @entity72 after 21 minutes of a league game			0
@entity74 , midfielder , 23 failed to make the grade at @entity76			0
was in @entity79 's @entity78 squad			0
@entity80 , midfielder , 19 younger brother of @entity22			0
bought by @entity82 in the summer and loaned back			0
@entity83 , striker , 22 six goals in all competitions this season			0
imposing figure at 6ft 4in			0
an impressive start to last season convinced the @entity2 board to make @entity14 's step up from assistant to manager permanent and their faith was justified with an eighth - placed finish last season			1
for a club walking a financial tightrope after 18 months of over-spending under @entity72 that was quite an achievement , especially given the mass exodus of players that @entity14 oversaw			2
but , although it may not have seemed that way when @entity14 was given the job 14 months ago , there was a plan in place to secure @entity2 's future by putting faith in a strong crop of academy players and loaning youngsters from @entity116 clubs			1
they could n't have imagined it would go this well though			0
@entity14 has @entity2 playing a possession - based game using the same 3 - 5 - 2 system we saw so often at the @entity78			1
against @entity19 , they had 62 per cent of the ball			0
it 's a joy to watch , or as @entity14 said himself on saturday : ' some of the football was amazing			2
they 're young players and they 're getting better and better			0
' captain @entity68 looks to diffuse the situation as tempers flare at @entity129 if last season exceeded expectations , then this campaign could well go down in footballing folklore if @entity2 can maintain their form and win promotion			0
to repeat : the average age of @entity14 's starting line - up is under 22			1
there are no veterans hiding away on the bench or in the reserves either			0
the average age of @entity14 's 24 - man squad ? 21.1			1
there is much debate to be had over whether there are ' right ' or ' wrong ' ways to do things in football , but however you like your bread buttered , you ca n't help but admire what 's going on at @entity2			0
good week for ... @entity154			1
the @entity155 are off the foot of the @entity158 table after a 3 - 0 win at @entity160 saw @entity162 's side leapfrog their opponents			1
the relegation hangover may finally have gone after two wins on the spin			0
bad week for ... @entity167			2
it seems the majority of @entity171 fans were glad to see the back of @entity173 when he left the club last week			2
but saturday 's 2 - 1 defeat at home to @entity177 shows there 's no quick fix to @entity167 's problems			1
talent scout : @entity182 ( @entity183 ) @entity182 's incredible goalscoring run continued on saturday as he scored his 13th goal in 11 games as @entity183 ran out 3 - 2 winners over @entity188 in @entity10			1
the 26 - year - old @entity189 , signed from @entity190 in may 2013 , has scored more than anyone else in the country this season			0
@entity182 ( centre ) celebrates afters coring his 13th goal of the season against @entity188 on saturday			2

@entity2 second in @entity10 table after 2 - 1 win at @entity19
@entity14 's side can move to within one point of @entity205 at the top of the table if they win their game in hand
average age of starting line - up vs @entity19 was just 21.9
just three players in @entity14 's squad over the age of 23
good week for @entity154 as they move of the foot of @entity158 table
bad week for @entity167 who continue to struggle after @entity173 left
@entity182 top scorer in @entity225 after *netting* 13th @entity183 goal
