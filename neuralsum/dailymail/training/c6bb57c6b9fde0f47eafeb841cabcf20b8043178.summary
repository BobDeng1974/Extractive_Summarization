by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 23 february 2013 updated : 17:21 est , 23 february 2013 basement flats are considered by many to be down - at - heel and gloomy			2
perhaps this is because in many @entity7 and @entity8 houses , they were originally used as quarters for servants working for the wealthy owners residing upstairs			0
their reputation was hardly enhanced in the @entity14 when , having been turned into independent apartments , some were put to use as brothels or illegal drinking and gambling dens			0
however , in recent years canny developers have realised that subterranean apartments in upmarket areas of @entity23 can be bought comparatively cheaply and then , with inventive lighting , be transformed into highly desirable abodes			1
down home : @entity27 at the entrance to her flat on exclusive @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity23 , which she is selling for £ 700,000 @entity27 , 43 , a horse - breeder from @entity33 , has certainly done well out of realising the potential of basement flats			1
she has bought a succession of apartments in @entity23 , renovated them , rented them and used the equity she has made to move up the property ladder			1
she bought her first in @entity42 , @entity23 , for £ 310,000 in 2008 and is now selling her latest project , in @entity30 , @entity31 , for £ 700,000			1
‘ i mainly work with lower - ground - floor flats as i know they are generally not the dark , damp , pokey basement many people seem to visualise them as before viewing them , ’ she says			2
‘ the lower - grounds i look for are usually part of large , impressive houses , with steps leading upstairs to the ground floor			2
’ transformed : @entity27 's two - bedroom basement flat in @entity23 's @entity31 on which she spent £ 90,000 to convert into a bright and inviting home below ground after her success with the @entity42 flat , @entity27 successfully developed two basement apartments in @entity62 , including one she bought for £ 371,000 in april 2010 that had been home to 19th century @entity66 painter @entity65 and later the notorious ‘ madam ’ @entity67			1
@entity27 spent £ 80,000 refurbishing it and sold it for £ 560,000			1
she bought the two - bedroom flat in @entity30 with her property - developer brother @entity71 for £ 405,000 in february last year			1
in terms of location , they knew they were on to a winner – @entity30 is one of the most upmarket addresses in the country , with a long list of famous residents that includes @entity83 @entity82 and @entity84 , @entity87 engineer @entity85 , footballer @entity88 and actor @entity89			0
the property looked particularly pokey due to a number of large cupboards that lined the rooms , and it had been on the market for some time			0
but @entity27 and @entity71 instantly recognised its potential			1
they removed a fireplace in what was the front sitting room to allow plenty of space for a good - size double bedroom , and by disposing of one of the larger cupboards they were able to create a wet room			1
they turned the kitchen into an entrance hall , opening on to a study / second bedroom with doors that slide into the wall , and freed up the back rooms so they could be used as a sitting room and kitchen , with a door to the shared garden			2
exclusive address : the flat is located on @entity30 in @entity120 it took about six months to complete the £ 90,000 conversion , mainly due to objections from the other freeholders in the building			1
the flat is now for sale with @entity128 & @entity129 , an estate agent that specialises in lower - ground - floor properties in prime areas of the capital			1
@entity137 , the 43 - year - old @entity135 who set up the firm , says that the very mention of a basement flat can send shivers down the spine of prospective buyers			2
‘ if you take ten buyers , eight of them will not even consider them , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity148 buyers , for example , ca n’t get their head around them			0
‘ the whole notion of subterreanean dwelling is alien to them			0
@entity151 wo n’t touch them either			0
‘ but they offer excellent value for money , ’ he adds , ‘ typically going for 40 per cent less per square foot than the floors above			0
’ day also points out that because lower - ground - floor flats tend to have their own entrances , they feel more private than the flats on the floors above			2
they also often have the advantage of access to a garden at the back			0
but what @entity137 and @entity172 both insist is that often the biggest advantage of basements when it comes to selling is that they appeal to buyers who will not compromise on location – and they do n’t come much more exclusive than @entity31 ’s @entity30			0
