by @entity0 as the band churned out the familiar air , @entity2 ’s mouth formed a string of stilted , half - remembered phrases : ‘ send her victorious / happy and glorious … ’ the television director lingered on the close - up , searching for signs of patriotic fervour			1
@entity2 simply frowned and mumbled on			1
given the choice , he would surely have remained silent , since that is his preference			1
but he had n’t been given the choice			1
@entity17 had insisted prior to the match against @entity19 that his players sing the @entity21 very loudly , in order to demonstrate that they are ‘ proud and happy ’ to wear the shirt			1
it was a fatuous gesture designed to win a tub - thumping headline and a younger , more confident @entity2 might have ignored the demand			1
but these days he senses his @entity29 place is in the balance , so obedience was the prudent course			1
it all seemed dreadfully unfair			2
the principle involved is self - evident			2
we have the good fortune to live in a robust democracy that respects our right to remain silent when the anthem is played			1
clearly , it is not our most significant liberty but it is one we should not lightly surrender			2
@entity43 , the @entity29 coach , would appear to share that view , since he declined to sing the anthem in each of his 85 international appearances			1
yet here we had @entity17 denying that elementary freedom to @entity2 and the others			1
it shone a worrying light upon the manager ’s current state of mind			2
in full cry : @entity2 ( right ) toed the @entity21 line but did not appear comfortable edict : @entity17 told his players to sing the @entity21 the cliche insists that the @entity29 job drives them all mad in the end			1
it is n’t true but i can think of three or four who were just a stride or two ahead of the men in white coats before their term was over			2
yet the present manager has always seemed immune to such pressures			2
this is partly due to the range of his managerial experience — which includes four international teams and four @entity75 clubs — but still more to his personality			1
for @entity17 has a hinterland			1
this is not merely a matter of theatre , galleries and modern @entity83 novels but an abiding sense that his love for the game falls comfortably short of obsession ; that he understands how the world works outside football			2
after the past fractious week or so , we are less certain			2
at this stage of affairs , the phoney war , @entity17 finds himself giving a whole string of media conferences , despite having little to impart			1
his predecessors coped in their own , idiosyncratic fashion ; from @entity98 , who said little since he mistrusted his @entity99 , way back to sir @entity100 , who said even less since he mistrusted his audience			2
but @entity17 has always possessed the ability to fill reporters ’ notebooks with a stream of reassuring platitudes			1
with the anthem misjudgment and the consequent embarrassment to @entity2 , his assurance suddenly appears a good deal less serene			1
that impression is enhanced by the maladroit manner in which he dealt with @entity114 ’s display against @entity19			1
a constant menace : @entity114 shows flashes of brilliance during his cameo against @entity19 in seeking to spare the youngster the burden of excessive praise , he tilted the balance too far			1
‘ he ’s got to learn when to release the ball … for every good turn , there was a time when he lost the ball , ’ he said			2
in normal times , he would have handled it with ease			2
but these pressurised days are quite different and , for a moment , he seemed to be floundering			2
now , trivial though it may seem , this actually matters because @entity17 matters			1
for the next few weeks , the manager of the @entity29 football team will become the most scrutinised individual in our public life			1
his moods will be interpreted , his utterances diligently analysed			0
failure , in terms of a premature departure , will attract rancorous attacks			0
these will be led by the small tribe of armchair warriors who opposed his appointment , resent his indifference to their opinions and have spent these past two years willing him to stumble			0
the public at large , whose irrational expectations seem to be growing by the day , may be no less hostile			0
but if he should succeed … ? it would represent a miracle , of course ; a squad selected from less than a third of his nation ’s bloated @entity75 , a team skilfully fished from a pitifully shallow pool of talent			0
the rewards would include an open - top bus ride , an automatic knighthood and the guarantee of immortality			0
we may be sure that the unthinkable has crossed his mind			0
relax : leave @entity29 to the football and they will reap the rewards the likelihood is that his fate will settle somewhere between the two , with honourable elimination the reward for his endeavours			1
but such matters are beyond a manager ’s control and the realisation is proving unsettling			0
and so , in his desperation to affect events , he creates a distracting drama from a populist gesture			0
and all before a ball has been kicked			0
one day , when he reflects on the @entity193 of 2014 , @entity17 will look back on his decision and wonder : ‘ was it really worth the fuss ? ’ i suspect i know what his answer will be			1
meanwhile , a young man with a mass of anxieties flooding his mind will stand in line , mumbling patriotic platitudes , aware of his duty to appear ‘ proud and happy ’			0
while the rest of the world gets on with the football			0
winning is everything , second is nowhere : that ’s the line which sports people tend to recite when they want to appear mean and grimly purposeful			0
but it is n’t always true and this was a case in point			0
@entity217 , @entity218 , can be a tricky place for international rugby teams to visit			2
so tricky , in fact , that @entity221 had n’t lost there for 20 years and 31 test matches			0
yet @entity29 , whose chances were rated as lowly as 25 - 1 in some quarters , got within two heartbreaking minutes of a thoroughly deserved draw			1
deep breath now : @entity230 can not fail to hide his pain as @entity29 concede a crucial late try this was an @entity29 side , remember , who were missing around half of their first choices through injury and fixture chaos			1
a side , moreover , who played most of the final 10 minutes with 14 men			0
in such circumstances , survival without disgrace tends to be the highest ambition			0
but @entity29 were braver and bolder			1
they went for victory , for a shuddering upset ; and on a luckier day they might have landed it			0
of course , the @entity221 will be sharper next week ; indeed , they might even inflict a degree of damage			0
but @entity253 ’s @entity29 have made their statement , they have demonstrated their desire to compete and they know that a narrow defeat in @entity217 is worth a dozen cheap victories over some of the weaker @entity260 teams			1
in short , they have succeeded in sharpening the appetite for next year ’s @entity193			0
which goes to show what an honourable second place can achieve			0
he does not answer to a laddish nickname , indulge in blokeish banter or crave the company of bumptious celebs			0
instead , he fulfils his role as @entity273 football correspondent with grace and flair and an understated eloquence			0
he has held the job since 1991 , explaining and informing , painting pictures on the mind , never coming between the event and the radio audience			0
the voice : @entity265 ( right , alongside fellow @entity273 stalwart @entity283 in 2006 ) brings dignity to the airwaves he stands alongside such fabled figures as @entity287 and @entity288 as a master of his medium			0
@entity265 is stepping down from the role of chief football correspondent at the end of this @entity193			0
and radio sport will lose a gently memorable voice .			0
