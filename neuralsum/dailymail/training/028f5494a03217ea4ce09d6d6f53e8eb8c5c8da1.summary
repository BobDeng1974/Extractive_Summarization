by @entity0 published : 05:11 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 07:14 est , 22 august 2013 an amateur cameraman captured the moment that police tasered an apparently suicidal man as he hung from the edge of a freeway overpass , sending him plummeting towards the ground			1
footage of the incident shows the man falling about 15ft from the overpass near @entity12 , @entity13 , into an air cushion set up to break his fall			1
but even though the officers seem to have saved the man from killing himself , observers who are out of shot are heard saying : ' there is no denying it			1
this is becoming a police state			1
' suicide attempt ? police and firefighters surround a man hanging from a freeway overpass near @entity12 ready to act : the red dots of the tasers ' laser sights flash across the man 's behind and lower back down he comes : the man drops his hands and begins to fall backwards as he is hit by the electrical current a commenter on an @entity39 forum thread about the video says that the incident appears to have occurred over us99 , only several blocks from the main part of @entity12			1
as the video begins , it shows a man standing on a small ledge in front of a highway sign attached to the side of an overpass 15ft above the ground			2
firefighters at the scene have inflated a cushion to stop the man from falling to his death and provided a cherry picker for police officers to get in closer to where he clings to the side of the bridge			2
more police stand above him on the overpass , shining flashlights down to illuminate where he stands			2
as officers attempt to talk down the man , who is facing away from them , the tell - tale flash of laser sights begin to flicker across his lower back			2
wedged in place ? for a second after falling , the man appears to be stuck between the overpass and crane @entity82 first : but a police officer or firefighter quickly moves to dislodge him and he plummets to the ground help is at hand : paramedics rush forward with a stretcher to take the man to hospital after he lands suddenly , 53 seconds into the clip , the man shrieks in agony and clutches his backside , before dropping backwards and apparently smacking his head on the edge of the @entity99 cherry picker - which stops him from falling			0
although the footage is unclear , emergency services personnel then appear to lean over and push the man off the side of the bridge on to the inflatable , which police and firefighters have hurriedly pushed square beneath him			1
paramedics then rush forward with a wheeled stretcher and the man is presumably taken to hospital , as observers yell at them : ' let him go ! ' the response of those heard off camera to the events unfolding before them is indicative of the low esteem that police are held in by some in the @entity12 area			1
online commenters were less sympathetic to the tasered man 's plight			0
@entity126 wrote on the @entity128 comments section : ' typical f * * * * * * toads screaming about a " police state " and " let him go " at the end there			0
' this clown shuts down an entire freeway and is 25 ' above the concrete for his own selfish reasons			0
they bring him down without injury			0
what would they [ those heard out of shot ] have proposed to do ? ? ' @entity147 added : ' and if they left him alone to do his thing the whiners would be complaining that the police did nothing			0
' the film was uploaded to @entity128 15 hours ago , where it has already been watched more than 21,000 times , attracting nearly 400 comments at the time of writing			0
it has also apparently been uploaded several times to @entity159 .			0

footage captured witnesses to the incident near @entity12 , @entity13
