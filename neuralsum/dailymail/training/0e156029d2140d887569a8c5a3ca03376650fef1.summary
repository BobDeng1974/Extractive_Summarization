it was thought that only planets have rings , but now an asteroid has proved experts wrong			2
a rocky body orbiting the sun between @entity7 and @entity8 is girdled by two rings , scientists have learned			1
previously only giant gas planets , most famously @entity7 , were thought to possess bands made up of dust , rocks and ice			2
totally surprising : an asteroid orbiting the sun between @entity7 and @entity8 ( illustrated ) is girdled by two rings , scientists have learned			1
it is the first time that such a small celestial body with rings has been observed the ringed space rock , called @entity22 , was originally located in the @entity23 , which is a circling group of icy dwarf planets and comets at the edge of the solar system			1
at some point it was thrown out of the belt and now exists as the largest member of a group of objects known as the @entity35 , which are small solar system bodies with a an elliptical axis between two outer planets			0
astronomers stumbled across the rings while using several telescopes to observe @entity22 , which has a diameter of 155miles ( 250km )			1
‘ we were not even looking for rings , because they had never been observed around small objects like @entity22 , so it is a totally surprising discovery , ’ said dr @entity43 , from the @entity44 at the @entity45 , @entity46			1
the discovery has shocked experts as previously only giant gas planets , most famously @entity7 , were thought to possess rings made up of dust , rocks and ice			2
an image of @entity7 taken by @entity60 's @entity59 spacecraft is pictured ‘ we could even determine incredible details about the rings			0
there are two separate thin rings , which are comprised of ice particles and pebbles			1
‘ the two rings are only three and seven kilometres wide ( two and five miles ) and no more than a few hundred metres thick			0
‘ there are eight miles between the centres of the two rings and there is a nine kilometre ( five mile ) wide gap between them			0
‘ they have been measured at a distance of two billion kilometres with an accuracy of plus / minus a few hundred metres			0
’ the discovery is reported in the latest edition of the journal @entity80 .			0

astronomers at the @entity44 at the @entity45 , @entity46 , *spotted* the ringed asteroid
has a diameter of 155miles ( 250km ) and orbits the sun between @entity7 and @entity8 , girdled by two thin rings *composed* of ice particles and pebbles
the space rock , called @entity22 , was originally located in the @entity23
