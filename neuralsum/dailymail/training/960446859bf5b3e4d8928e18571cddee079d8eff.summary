by @entity0 published : 20:52 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 03:10 est , 13 january 2014 travels : @entity3 on @entity4 in @entity5 in the winter of 2012/2013 during his 101 - day journey around the nation to visit his former students a passionate @entity11 teacher robbed of his memories by terminal brain cancer decided to seize each day left to him the best way he knew how - by traveling the country to visit his favorite former students and ask them what impact he made to their lives			1
@entity3 , 41 , spent 15 - years teaching at @entity19 in @entity20 but three invasive surgeries , two - and - a - half years of chemotherapy and 30 rounds of radiation therapy had left him almost - blind and with limited mobility			1
unable to continue his life 's work teaching his 11th graders , @entity3 set off in november of 2012 on a countrywide trip to meet his former students to simply ask them if he had made a difference in their lives			1
the @entity33 devotee dubbed his journey the ' @entity35 ' and in august of 2012 , @entity3 posted a message to @entity37 , asking if any of his 3,000 former @entity39 alumni wanted to meet him , reminisce about his lessons and most importantly - let him sleep on their couch			1
@entity3 , who had separated from his wife when he began to plan his final trip , was astounded to receive replies from students in 50 cities across the @entity47			1
despite a seizure robbing him of his sight and the use of most of the left side of his body , @entity3 resolved to undertake the trip on his own by bus			1
scroll down for @entity55 send off : @entity58 with current students and teachers of @entity19 in @entity20 , where his former students number almost 3,000 @entity61 : this map shows pins set down across the @entity47 where @entity3 met former students - traveling 8,000 miles by bus and air in the process ' i am at the end of my life , ' he explained to @entity71			1
' i do n't know how much longer i have left , and i just wanted that sense of satisfaction that the time i did have i used well			2
' now , @entity3 's journey has been published as a book , entitled the @entity79 teacher ’s @entity77 to @entity81 ’s @entity80 - which is published this month			1
the oldest of his students were in their early 30s - some with families of their own - and the popular @entity11 teacher wanted to ' get caught up and see the results of my work			1
' sadly his treatment has left him with ' massive ' memory loss			2
' i do n't remember my childhood at all			0
in fact , i do n't remember anything prior to roughly 16 or 17 years old			0
and even the things that i was doing as a teacher are somewhat spotty '			2
students : @entity3 's last day in with former student @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 - his next stop was @entity100 so , as he traveled to meet students across the nation , @entity3 was told of a much - loved teacher who made learning a joy			1
he discovered he would be as comfortable teaching @entity105 as rapper , @entity106			0
that instead of becoming annoyed with his students for passing notes , he would tell them , ' i 'm an @entity11 teacher ! why would n't i encourage you to read and write ? ' indeed , on the rare occasion that a student fell asleep , @entity3 would paint @entity114 on their noses			1
the inspirational teacher spent 101 days on the road and visited 31 cities across 8,000 miles , speaking to 75 former students who lived as far afield as @entity120			1
one ex-pupil was @entity122 , who is now an aspiring screenwriter in @entity123			0
happy : this is @entity3 with former students he met up with during his travels and here is one student ( left ) who @entity3 discovered to his surprise had stolen her favorite texts from class that he taught he told @entity71 that @entity3 was ' one of the few teachers i felt who were really present			1
i 've had great teachers in my life , but he was really present in the moment			2
' the former student and one - time teacher spent time together talking and going to the movies			0
' there was a fleeting moment when we were sitting around a computer sharing silly internet videos together and laughing , ' @entity122 said			0
' he ceased to be my old teacher , and he was definitely a friend			0
' his failing health was never an excuse and @entity3 made it to @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity120 and @entity5 among other cities			1
along the way he discovered something poignant and wonderful : ' it seems like it was not a wasted life , ' he said to @entity71			0
' i was n't so sure — i honestly was n't			0
' diagnosed with terminal brain cancer the day before @entity161 in 2006 , aged 34 - @entity3 was told then he had less than a year to live			1
refusing to be bowed by this death sentence , he threw himself into his work			0
champion : @entity3 poses with the statue of @entity166 at the @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity169 and here is @entity3 with former students in @entity172 ( right ) ' for six years , the only time i was n't in class was when i was undergoing brain surgery			1
i never avoided the topic of my cancer , glioblastoma multiforme , with my students , but it was not something i dwelled on , nor did they , ' he said to @entity183			2
' i covered my bald , lacerated head with a woolen hat and scheduled chemotherapy around my classes , and i got so good at being sick that i could run to the bathroom , heave into the toilet , flush , brush my teeth and fly back to class in under three minutes			0
they pretended not to notice			0
' however , despite his new - found zest for life to use every day to its fullest , in the summer of 2012 , he was hit by a huge seizure which robbed him of his ability to teach any longer			2
' the cancer had finally succeeded in taking me out of the classroom , but i was n't ready to let it take me out of the game , ' said @entity3 to @entity183			1
' i was n't afraid to die			0
i was afraid of living without a purpose			0
' bravery : after being diagnosed with one year left to live almost eight years ago - @entity3 has refused to give in or take any day for granted release : this is the @entity79 - which will be released this month and tells the poignant story of @entity3 's journey around the @entity47 from november 2012 to february 2013 to visit his ex-pupils the greatest lesson that @entity3 learned on his journey was that he made the most difference in what he and his students came to dub ' intimate interludes ' between classes , ' when we shared heartaches and vulnerabilities and victories			1
' ' to learn this meant the world to me , it really did , ' said @entity3 to @entity183			2
' the truth of it is those were the moments when i was trying my hardest , when i really wanted to be at my very best , so that i could set an example for them that they could look to			0
' it was just overwhelming the generosity and love that i got back			0
' ' not only did they give my life meaning while i was a teacher , even after i left the class room they continued to give me a sense of purpose			2
' now living in his new home of @entity241 , @entity3 is preparing to publicize his incredible book and journey and ready himself for the inevitable			2
' i am one of those people who has had to face my fate squarely and my reality is that i have a brain tumor and it is not going to go away			0
' rather than taking that as a death sentence it gave me a sense of urgency that if there was living to be done now is the time to do it .			0
