33 per cent of births in 2012 were delivered through cesarean section
the birth rate for all women of *childbearing* age , *63* births per *1,000* women , was essentially flat from the year before .
rates dropped for @entity137 women , down two per cent , and *blacks* , one per cent , but less than the previous year . the rate continued to stay the same for *whites* , which rose four per cent , and for @entity142 . rates fell slightly for @entity143 and @entity145 natives .

@entity120 also rose two per cent for ***mothers*** aged *35* and older , and one per cent for women in their early 40s . rates in older ***mothers*** have been rising slightly in recent years , despite the overall downward trend . experts say the trend is because older women *generally* have better jobs or financial security and are more aware of their *biological* clocks .
