on thursday , it was officially announced at @entity3 's @entity2 that @entity4 would be reprising his role as super-spy 007 in @entity7 , the latest film in the saga , which will be directed by @entity10			1
as well as the veteran bond hero , the latest installment of the action film franchise will see other cast members making a return to the film , including @entity17 as @entity18 , @entity19 as @entity20 , @entity21 as @entity22 and @entity23 as @entity24			2
however , a new film means a new @entity26 and this one is perhaps the most illusive we are yet to see			2
@entity30 actress @entity29 will be taking on the role of femme fatale , she 'll play the part of @entity34 alongside @entity35 who at 50 , is the oldest @entity26 girl to ever grace our screens			1
@entity29 is perhaps best known for her part in the sexually explicit lesbian drama , @entity52 is the @entity55			1
the role saw the actress take part in a seven - minute long sex scene with co-star @entity60 that left very little to the imagination			2
so when it comes to the sexpectations of a @entity26 girl , @entity29 is unlikely to be camera shy			1
in fact , some of her required scenes in the @entity26 film will seem like light relief for @entity71 - she and @entity60 openly criticised the director behind the cult gay film , @entity74 , for his over-demanding sex scenes			1
cult film : @entity29 ( right ) is most famous for starring alongside @entity60 ( left ) in the 2013 film @entity78 , which followed the story of two lesbian lovers both girls said that despite the film 's success - it won top prize at the 2013 @entity86 - they will never work with @entity74 again , with the @entity60 adding that most directors would have ' more respect ' than to ask what he asked of them			1
despite her convincing performance in the film , @entity29 disappointed many of her legions of fans when she revealed that she was actually in a serious relationship with a man			2
although she did admit that months of preparing for the part had left her questioning her sexuality at times			0
she told the @entity100 earlier this year : ' of course i did			0
me as a person , as a human being … ’ ‘ it ’s not nothing , making those scenes			0
of course i question myself			0
but … i did not have any revelations			0
’ @entity29 guards her love life furiously though and has so far refused to mention her boyfriend 's name in any interviews			2
controversial : although her most famous role , @entity29 revealed that she would never work with the director of the film again because of his demanding attitudes towards the infamous sex scenes award winning : despite the conflict that came with @entity52 is the @entity55 , the film won top prize at the 2013 @entity86 while @entity29 does n't have the same fame status as some of the previous bond girl alumni , she has been rubbing shoulders with the stars in @entity128 blockbusters for years			1
in 2009 , she made an appearance as @entity130 in @entity132 's @entity131 and in 201 , she offered @entity133 a shoulder to cry on in @entity135 's ' midnight in @entity136 ' as @entity137 , the @entity30 girl who shares his love of the songwriter @entity139			2
she has also earned her stripes in the fighting department - it is common knowledge that every @entity26 girl can kick as well as they can kiss and @entity29 's triumphs in the film industry have already seen her get in a fair bit of practice			1
she first tried her hand at spy films when she starred in 2011 's ' @entity152 : @entity153 ' as a knife - carrying assassin , sure to come in handy in the 007 flick which is due to be released in november 2015			2
have n't we seen you before ? @entity29 appeared alongside @entity133 in @entity135 's 2011 film , midnight in @entity136 she gets about ! @entity29 also made a cameo appearance in @entity161 's @entity160 where she played a maid ( in background ) and this role of @entity34 should come as quite a triumph for @entity29 who has been pining after a strong female lead since auditioning for the role of @entity169 in @entity170			1
she has previously spoken of her disappointment at learning the part had been given to actress @entity173			2
in an interview with @entity175 , she said : ' i got upset , but i do n't think i 'd be able to do anything to get that part			0
it was totally against my nature			0
i worked hard , but @entity169 was almost anorexic			0
i was n't like that			0
' and the 29 - year - old has remained true to her ethics on whether women should change themselves too much for a role			1
speaking about the weight of expectation for a @entity26 girl , she insisted : ' you have to get rid of the pressure , you just have to invent something new			2
' fashionable friends : @entity29 's father is best friends with @entity195 who designed @entity29 her first pair of designer shoes at the age of 12 so stylish : @entity29 has been noted for her good taste in clothing and has landed several fashion campaigns trend setter : @entity29 makes an effort to keep abreast of latest fashions , often seen attending fashion shows such as the @entity206 15 ( left ) she is often spotted wearing @entity206 , one of her favourite brands ( right ) one aspect of the @entity26 image that @entity29 unquestionably fits the bill for , is her penchant for style			1
the @entity136 actress has been turning heads on the red carpet with her bold style choices for the last few years , something that has been influenced by her childhood			0
ahead of the release of @entity52 is the @entity55 last summer , @entity29 revealed told the @entity100 that her childhood had involved one very stylish perk			1
in the interview she revealed that her summers as a child were spent with her father 's best friend , @entity195			0
@entity227 said : ' he used to come to our holiday house in @entity230 , on an island called @entity232 , and draw shoes , shoes , shoes			0
' his influence saw @entity29 acquiring expensive taste from a young age when the shoe designer , famous for his red soles , made her sister her first louboutins when she was 14 and @entity29 received her first pair at the age of 12			2
as well as fashionable friends , @entity71 has grown up surrounded by a family who were blessed with success and style which are no doubt an influence on the young actress ' good eye for clothing			0
her mother , @entity255 , is an actress turned philanthropist and her father is a businessman who runs the @entity30 wireless company @entity259			2
but the family have a long history in film and television - her grandfather @entity265 is the chairman of the film company @entity266 and her granduncle @entity267 is the chairman of @entity268			0
meanwhile , her older sister @entity269 is now a stylist who dresses @entity71 and @entity270 , star of the artist			0
@entity29 has also dabbled in fashion herself , appearing in a campaign for clothing brand @entity274 along side @entity277 actor @entity276 for their @entity280 collection			0
she also appeared in @entity206 's 2014 resort campaign with @entity52 is the @entity55 co-star @entity60 and is currently the face of @entity285 's fragrance , @entity286			1
@entity29 continued her stylish successes yesterday as she arrived at the announcement of the film 's much anticipated title in a fitted black @entity206 dress , with matching belt and shoes			1
filming for the new flick begins on monday and so far @entity29 has given little away as to what we can expect from her character			0
she said : ' i 've read the script but it only becomes real when you start			0
for now it 's kind of abstract			0
' meanwhile , leading man @entity4 was slightly more telling , describing the script for @entity7 as ' better than we had last time '			0
here come the girls : @entity29 will star alongside @entity35 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) in @entity7 , which is due to start filming on monday optimistic : @entity4 ( centre ) said of the latest @entity26 film ' we 've got an amazing cast and , i think , a better script than we had last time ' the 46 - year - old actor expects the movie to be superior to the 2012 hit @entity314 , which made more than $ 1.1 billion ( £ 701million ) at the worldwide box office			1
although the actor did not speak specifically about @entity29 , the 46 - year - old said that he though his co-stars were ' amazing			1
' ' we 've got an amazing cast and , i think , a better script than we had last time			0
' the title of the new @entity10 - directed film relates to the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , which is led by iconic evil genius @entity323 , the scarred super-villain whose organisation played a prominent part in the @entity328 and @entity329 movies			1
plot details of the new movie - which sees @entity17 replace @entity332 as @entity18 , the head of the @entity335 intelligence service - read : ' a cryptic message from @entity26 's past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organisation			1
' while @entity18 battles political forces to keep the secret service alive , @entity26 peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind @entity7			1
we may not know her name yet but if the phenomenal success of @entity314 , the last @entity350 picture , is anything to go by , @entity29 will soon be a global star .			1
