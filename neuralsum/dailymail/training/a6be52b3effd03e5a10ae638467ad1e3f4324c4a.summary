@entity0 may have raised an inquisitive eyebrow at this @entity3 performance ; he will know @entity4 are in for a proper game when they arrive here in the @entity7 on sunday			1
it was a night not befitting a team who had won only three championship games before the end of december and are still trying to haul themselves away from the relegation zone			1
but then again , in @entity16 the @entity15 have a manager who is already turning the tide on the south coast			2
with @entity22 loanee @entity21 they have a diminutive figure who is able to unlock at will , and it was he who scored two stunning goals for which @entity27 had no answer			1
@entity21 ( centre ) scores @entity3 's second goal in the 3 - 2 win over @entity27 @entity21 ( centre ) is congratulated after scoring his first goal of the night @entity21 ( right ) celebrates with @entity34 after scoring @entity3 's third goal @entity3 : @entity36 ; @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ; @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity43 , @entity21 ( march 86 ) , @entity34 ; @entity44 ( @entity45 77 ) subs not used : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 goals : @entity34 18 , @entity21 38 , 45 @entity27 : @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ; @entity58 ( @entity59 50 ) , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 74 ) ; @entity64 ( @entity65 65 ) , @entity66 subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 goals : @entity66 22 , @entity59 78 referee : @entity74 attendance : 23,880 ‘ i ’m delighted with the performance , ’ said @entity16 , who sees his side now six points clear of the drop			1
he has quality and somebody who is prepared to work hard			2
you need to get him on the ball			2
he ’s still young - today would ’ve done him the world of good			2
’ @entity34 had given @entity3 a lead - unstoppably lashing across @entity53 - before @entity66 ’s deft volley levelled for @entity88 ’s side three minutes later , his 18th of the campaign			1
it seemed the visitors , who could ’ve gone top with a win , would then turn the screw but @entity21 had other ideas			1
firstly he picked up possession from the impressive @entity42 40 yards from goal , driving purposefully at five defenders , before jinking inside and smashing into the top corner via a deflection			1
and if that was n’t enough , the @entity101 added a third in first - half stoppage time , arriving late to a clever @entity40 cut - back and leathering home			2
it is his first sustained spell away from @entity108 , and @entity109 will like what he is seeing			0
@entity88 , meanwhile , did not			0
‘ i 'm not happy about the goals - that is n't like us , ’ he said			0
‘ our first - half performance was n’t what i ’d expect			0
maybe one or two of them are knackered			0
‘ they 're all off until monday			0
go on holiday , have a beer with their mates , whatever			0
’ @entity16 has made an instant impact at @entity3 since replacing @entity124 @entity3 keeper @entity36 rushes out of his area to claim a ball into the box @entity128 had chances to pile further misery on @entity88 but fluffed his lines on a number of occasions as @entity3 quite rightly looked towards the flamboyant @entity21 for inspiration			1
they would be advised to do similar when @entity0 and @entity4 come to town			1
‘ he ’s just too good for you , ’ they sang inside the @entity138 and that was no exaggeration			0
@entity42 had a header cleared off the line while @entity39 saw his looping effort tipped over			0
and they could have been made to pay for those close calls after @entity59 slipped underneath @entity36 in the 78th minute and @entity66 almost squeezed in a late equaliser but the eventual difference was a little playmaker from @entity150 .			0

@entity21 , on loan from @entity22 , inspires @entity3 to *victory*
@entity27 could have gone top of @entity156 with a win
@entity3 host @entity4 in the @entity7 on *saturday*
