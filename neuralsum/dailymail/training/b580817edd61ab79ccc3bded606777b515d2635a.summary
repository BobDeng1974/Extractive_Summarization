by @entity0 for @entity1 a stunning rural landscape hailed as one of the finest views in @entity5 by the @entity6 could be ruined by a 242ft high wind turbine			1
the outlook from @entity9 towards the imposing @entity10 on the @entity11 has become an iconic image of the @entity13			1
it features in the book ' @entity5 's @entity16 ' and features @entity18 forts , a roman temple and ancient woodlands			0
mocked up plans for wind turbine on @entity23			1
right showing @entity10 , left is where the turbine could be under threat : @entity9 lies seven miles to the north west of the @entity28 , which is owned by the @entity6 but the skyline is under threat after plans were submitted for a towering turbine which would provide enough power for 400 local homes			1
the proposals come from @entity37 - based firm @entity36 run by @entity38 , a @entity40 board member			0
he admitted the site is contentious , but said the overall impact on the area will be minimal			0
' as far as @entity46 is concerned there are relatively limited opportunities for turbines , ' he said			0
' but this is relatively simple as far as good conditions and delivery are concerned and there are not that many people who live very close to the site			0
the overall impact on the local population is going to be low			0
' but local residents and the @entity6 fear the development will tarnish the treasured landscape			1
the view : @entity10 can be seen on the hill at @entity11 in the distance			1
the turbine would appear to the left just of this image @entity37 - based @entity36 have put in an application for the lone turbine , which is says will power 400 local homes a @entity6 spokesman said : ' @entity11 is an incredibly special place and we want to make sure its setting , the wider landscape and views , both to and from , are protected			1
' we believe that appropriately designed wind has an important part to play in a mix of @entity81 renewables , but it must work in harmony with the landscape			2
' we are now carefully considering this planning application and the scale and location of the proposed wind turbine			2
' @entity9 lies seven miles to the north west of the @entity28 , which is owned by the @entity6			1
@entity10 , also known as @entity10 or @entity10 , is a folly built in the 18th century that looks out over the @entity13			1
it lies near the location of ' @entity94 's stone ' where it is believed that @entity96 , @entity97 , rallied the @entity98 in may 878 before the @entity99			0
the tower was also intended to commemorate the end of the @entity102 against @entity103 and the accession of @entity105 it was designed by @entity107 , a @entity108 architect , in 1765 and completed in 1772			0
the tower was damaged in 1944 when an aeroplane , a @entity111 , crashed into it , resulting in the death of the five aircrew			0
then it was designated as a grade i listed building before being restored in 1986			0
it is home to @entity10 - a 160ft tall folly tower marking the spot where @entity96 rallied the forces of @entity46 , @entity124 and @entity125 , before his decisive defeat at the @entity99 in @entity127			1
it was erected in the mid 18th century by banker @entity129 , then owner of the @entity11 estate , and dominates the landscape in the @entity133			1
in his book ' @entity5 's @entity16 ' , the @entity6 's chairman sir @entity134 describes the vista from @entity9 towards @entity137 as the best view of the @entity13			1
he wrote : ' @entity9 stands seven miles to the north and is closer to the @entity140			1
it looks up to @entity11 behind it , and looks across to @entity142 to the left			2
' it directly overlooks the golden limestone town of @entity146 , deep in the @entity148 valley and with only its church and dovecot visible from a distance			2
' @entity36 has submitted plans to @entity46 to erect the turbine at @entity23 , a 300 - acre family organic farm			1
but @entity154 , a former @entity155 councillor now living at @entity146 , is one of many locals who have written to the planning department to object			2
he believes the turbine will ' degrade a rural landscape particularly in a tourist area '			2
he is also worried that photographs submitted with the application were misleading and that the @entity163 will insist on it having a warning light on top			2
@entity166 has already raised its opposition to the turbine because of its proposed position in an @entity170			0
in a response to the application , it said : ' whilst we are not sure this wind turbine will be visible from this parish , @entity166 is opposed to all applications that could cause any detrimental effect upon the visual amenity of the village which is within an @entity170			0
' it goes on to say : ' concern has also been expressed that this development would set a precedent for other , similar , developments and that if we are not careful these structures could spring up throughout the area and would blight the countryside around us			0
' a decision from @entity46 is due on september 19 .			0
