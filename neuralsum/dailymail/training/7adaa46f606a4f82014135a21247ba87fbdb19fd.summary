by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 13:54 est , 3 december 2012 the team behind the world 's solar powered plane that can fly by night are planning their most ambitious adventure yet - to circumnavigate the globe in 20 days and nights without a drop of fuel			1
the @entity10 currently holds the record for the longest flight by a manned solar - powered plane , staying in the skies 30,000 ft above @entity15 for more than 26 hours			1
created by @entity15 adventurers @entity18 and @entity19 , it flies using four propeller engines powered by 12,000 solar cells attached to vast wings			1
scroll down to see @entity10 in action record breaker : the @entity10 currently holds the record for the longest flight by a manned solar - powered plane , staying in the skies 30,000 ft above @entity15 for more than 26 hours it is not the first plane to be powered solely by the light of the sun , but it is the first to be able to continue its flight even after night has fallen - all the way until the dawn			1
it collects so much energy from the sun during the day that it can store electricity to power it through the night			1
earlier this year it completed a 1,550 - mile voyage across @entity41 to @entity42 in three steps , but its creators believe its radical design could allow it to fly forever			2
high tech : made from lightweight materials , the @entity10 has a wingspan to match a jumbo yet weighs only as much as a small car for the solar cells which power the the engines of @entity10 are not just attached to its wings - they are its wings			1
mr @entity18 told @entity56 how the solar cell wings convert light directly to electricity			1
' and then this electricity goes simultaneously to the engines and to the batteries and then we will reach the next sunrise and capture the sun again , ' he said			2
' and we can continue theoretically forever			0
' constructed from lightweight materials , the @entity10 has a wingspan to match a jumbo jet yet weighs only as much as a small car			2
the plane 's wings are covered with solar panels housing thousands of cells designed to collect the energy of the sun 's rays and power four electric motors driving wing - mounted propellers			1
mr @entity18 could be said to have adventure in the blood			0
his grandfather @entity82 set an altitude record , and is perhaps the first person to have seen the curvature of the @entity86			2
his father @entity87 went the other way , plunging in a bathyscape to the bottom of @entity91 in the @entity92 , the deepest location of the @entity86 's crust			0
' that was really impressive for me as a kid because i was reading in the history books all the stories about the @entity86 being flat , being round or whatever , ' he told @entity56			0
' and my grandfather came back and said , " i saw the curvature of the @entity86 with my eyes			0
" so once you live this as a kid , of course , you want to continue into that field of exploration			0
' ambitious : @entity18 , left , @entity19 celebrate after successfully landing the solar - powered @entity111 - @entity110 prototype airplane after its first successful night flight attempt in 2010 and @entity18 clan 's latest adventurer has not been slow off the mark , already winning the first trans - @entity117 balloon race and becoming the first person to complete a nonstop balloon flight around the globe			1
it was after nearly running out of fuel and crash landing in the @entity126 desert on that latter escapade mr @entity18 dreamed up the idea of circling the globe in an aircraft that needed no fuel			0
' it was almost a failure due to the dependency on fuel and on that day i made a promise , ' he said			0
' i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world it would be with no fuel at all			0
' although the goal is to show that emissions - free air travel is possible , the team has said it does not see solar technology replacing conventional jet - powered planes any time soon			1
instead , the project is designed to test and promote new energy - efficient technologies			0
mr @entity18 and mr @entity19 hope to test the latest design of their aircraft with a flight from @entity156 to @entity157 next year , before embarking on their epic round the world trip in 2015 .			2

@entity10 team already hold record for longest solar - powered flight
their aircraft is powered by 12,000 solar cells attached to its wings
batteries store electricity to keep the *glider* - like plane aloft at night
they plan to begin their circumnavigation in 2015
