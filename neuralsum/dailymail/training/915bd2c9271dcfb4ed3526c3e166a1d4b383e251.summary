@entity17 told @entity19 : ' people are very suspicious of law enforcement as it is and something like this happens you will always be remembered as the cop who murdered @entity69 , regardless of what happens at trial or if he 's ever charged or fired			1
' obviously he 's not going to be able to be a cop over there ( in @entity59 ) any more			0

he does n't deserve that			0

needless : @entity17 , who believes police should be trained better to use non-lethal force , said : ' it 's sad for @entity69 and his family			1

describing his friend , @entity17 said : ' he ’s pretty shy , we had hockey practice three or four nights a week so you get to know people			2
' he 's the type of guy who never had anything bad to say about anyone			0
through all of this people are always asking me questions about what he 's like and i realized that when you 're talking to him he 's never talking about himself , he 's always asking about you and what 's going on with you			0
' he ’s happy to be around his friends , he goes with the flow , he 's laid back …			0
he 's just a normal guy '			0
after @entity8 was named as the officer involved in the shooting , @entity17 was one of the first to come to his defense and wrote on @entity102 that he ' has the biggest heart '			2
@entity17 said that @entity8 ' had a rough life ' because his mother died when he was 16 and his biological father lives in another state , meaning that he never really had parents for much of his youth			1
troubled : @entity17 said that @entity8 's mother died when he was 16 and his biological father lives out of state - but added that @entity8 ( pictured in his 2002 yearbook ) never liked to talk about his hardships whenever he asked @entity172 about it he did not like to talk about the past , @entity17 said			1

‘ @entity221 ' , who would only give her first name but said she was friends with the cop 's girlfriend , had her account corroborated by a source who said it matched what @entity8 told investigators , @entity37 reported on monday			2
according to the @entity235 more than a dozen witnesses have backed up officer @entity8 's report of what happened on august 9			1
meanwhile , @entity8 ’s father , @entity172 , 60 , - who lives in @entity240 - has been nervously watching the @entity59 furor play out on national tv news and talk shows			2
' it goes without saying that i love my son very much , ' mr @entity8 told @entity19 as he stood on the wooden deck outside his single - story prefab home on a remote country lane , east of @entity251			2
mr @entity8 said that he has spoken to his son since the shooting but he was reluctant to reveal what father and son spoke about or how @entity8 is handling the tense situation he is in			0
' the police have chosen not to make any comment about my son , other than to release his name , ' added mr @entity8			0
' and @entity8 himself has not made a statement			0
so until they do come out and say something , i am not going to talk about it either			0

@entity17 , a friend of 14 years , showed @entity19 texts from @entity8
@entity8 , who shot dead @entity30 , sparking seven nights of *unrest* , ' ca n't go out ' and thanked him for support during ' stressful time '

he feels bad that now @entity30 's and @entity8 's lives are both ' now over '
@entity17 that while @entity30 's family has the support of the ' whole nation ' ... ' @entity8 does n't get that '
