peugeot 2008 @entity0 on sale : from 2016 @entity2 : circa £ 16,000this week i became the first @entity5 journalist — and one of the very first in the world — to road - test the radical new family car that drives on air : the @entity9 , developed by @entity10 and @entity12 electronics giant @entity11			1
i took it on an adventurous spin on frenetically busy roads around the heart of @entity19 , past landmarks such as the @entity21 and the @entity22			0
it has a conventional , but frugal threecylinder 1.2 litre petrol engine linked to a hydraulic air - motor and pump plus a hightech automatic electronic gear system			1
exclusive first drive : @entity29 was the first @entity5 journalist to test drive the @entity30 driving feels a little different to a conventional automatic car			1
a visual display on the dashboard screen tells you when you are in zero pollution or petrol mode			0
it chugs happily along in town running only on air			1
it certianly did n't run out of puff and giving the accelerator a quick burst — vital on @entity19 roads to keep you out of trouble — meant the combined force of the 82bhp petrol engine and the 40bhp air motor kicked in together to put wind in its sails			2
economy is an impressive 94 mpg			0
the engineers ' aim is for a car that will return 140mpg			0
on sale from 2016 with a lessthan - inflated price tag of around £ 16,000			2
the sports utility vehicle will be the first of a new generation of peugeots and citroens running on air and follows earlier experiments on smaller @entity67			1
air power : the sports utility vehicle will be the first of a new generation of peugeots and citroens running on air and we 're off ! the car 's top speed is 108mph and it will go from rest to 62mph in around 10 seconds the revolutionary new engine system is the first to combine conventional petrol power with compressed air — operating in tandem like a bicycle pump and a balloon			1
top speed is 108mph and it will go from rest to 62mph in around 10 seconds			2
average co2 emissions are exceptionally low at 69g/km and it has a range of about 850 miles			2
in ' air ' mode , zero - emissions driving is possible for 80 per cent of the time , with no fuel consumption			1
predicted to cut fuel bills around town by 45 per cent and overall by more than a third ( 35 per cent )			1
the air tank is underneath the car and air is repeatedly compressed using energy retrieved from the petrol engine , moving wheels and during braking			0
seeing the sights : @entity29 took the air car for a test drive through the heart of @entity19 air power — for lower - speed driving in cities — is automatically activated below 43mph			1
combined or ' hybrid ' mode is best for high - power acceleration or hill climbing			1
petrol power is best for long - distance cruising			2
it does n't look wacky			0
from the outside it 's identical to a conventional vehicle because the revolutionary system can be used on any normal family car without altering its external shape or size			0
cars fitted with @entity0 will be about £ 1,000 cheaper than current electric - hybrid models , say @entity10 officials			0
motorists wo n't run the risk of running out of compressed air late at night on a deserted country road , because the car will be fitted with a sophisticated artificial brain that ensures it replenishes itself automatically — compressing and decompressing of its own accord as the car speeds up and slows down			2
behind the wheel : a stripped - back look at the new hybrid			0
motorists will be able to use zero - emissions air power for lower - speed driving			1
the feature is activated automatically when the car is doing under 43mph the car of the future : the air powered car will be on sale from 2016 , for circa £ 16,000 a curious clackety hiss and hum of the air pump when in zeroemissions mode			0
not the best start when the car suffered an initial technical ' glitch ' and came to an embarrassing halt — with me at the wheel			0
still a few rough edges to iron out but surely the finished , showroom version will be smoother .			0

the @entity30 runs on nothing more than air
@entity29 was the first @entity5 journalist to take it for a drive
first of a new generation of peugeots and citroens running on air
predicted to cut fuel bills by 45 per cent
it can *provide* zero - emissions air power for lower - speed driving in cities
