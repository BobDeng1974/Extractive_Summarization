by @entity0 published : 10:56 est , 13 march 2012 updated : 02:43 est , 14 march 2012 @entity2 should consider extreme options - such as taking pills to wean humanity away from eating meat or genetically engineering ourselves to be smaller - in order to reduce our ecological footprint , says a leading philosopher			1
from reducing our reliance on fossil fuels to finding more energy - efficient ways to travel , the push is on for humans to combat the threat of global climate change			1
but the ways in which we change our behaviour - either culturally or through technology - are still up for debate			1
engineering of the future : could we re-wire humans to be intolerant of meat and less of a drain on our planet 's resources ? professor @entity29 of @entity30 has outlined some of the dramatic ways we can alter our future			1
professor @entity29 suggests we debate new methods to reduce our damage to the environment he and his co-authors make suggestions ranging from providing pills that give people an aversion to eating meat to genetic engineering or hormone therapy so that parents give birth to smaller , less resource - intensive children			1
their paper , to be published in @entity51 , lists techniques which many people will be uncomfortable with			0
but @entity29 and his co-writers , @entity55 and @entity56 , stress that they are not advocating any of these approaches , just offering them up for discussion as to the pros and cons , and they also stressed their support for individual choice			1
speaking about his paper to the @entity66 magazine , @entity29 said market solutions , such as carbon pricing , were not necessarily enough to solve the problems facing humanity			0
he said : ' so far it seems like it 's pretty difficult to orchestrate workable international agreements to affect international emissions trading			1
' the @entity76 , for instance , has not produced demonstrable reductions in global emissions , and in any event demand for petrol and for electricity seems to be pretty inelastic			1
and so it 's questionable whether carbon taxation alone can deliver the kind of reduction that we need to really take on climate change			0
' world in our hands : there 's little we can do to destroy the planet , but we may be able to destroy our place within it regarding the controversial geo - engineering idea , he said that there were inherent risks with the suggestion , in regards to it being an untested technology and the unforeseen consequences of trying it on a global scale			1
he said : ' you have to worry that by implementing these techniques we could endanger ourselves or future generations			0
' for example it 's been suggested that we could alter the reflectivity of the atmosphere using sulfate aerosol so as to turn away a portion of the sun 's heat , but it could be that doing so would destroy the ozone layer , which would obviously be problematic			0
' others have argued that we ought to fertilize the ocean with iron , because doing so might encourage a massive bloom of carbon - sucking plankton			2
' but doing so could potentially render the ocean inhospitable to fish , which would obviously also be quite problematic			0
' attempts at fiddling with nature , either environmentally or genetically , have been risky in the past			2
for instance , the introduction of new animals almost always adversely affects the local fauna , such as when rabbits were introduced to @entity131 in the 18th century - which quickly escaped their pens and decimated wide swathes of the country			2
however , in terms of the benefits , @entity29 said : ' one of the things that we noticed is that human ecological footprints are partly correlated with size			0
' each kilogram of body mass requires a certain amount of food and nutrients and so , other things being equal , the larger person is the more food and energy they are going to soak up over the course of a lifetime			2
' there are also other , less obvious ways in which larger people consume more energy than smaller people - for example a car uses more fuel per mile to carry a heavier person , more fabric is needed to clothe larger people , and heavier people wear out shoes , carpets and furniture at a quicker rate than lighter people , and so on			1
' if you reduce the average @entity172 height by just 15cm , you could reduce body mass by 21 per cent for men and 25 per cent for women , with a corresponding reduction in metabolic rates by some 15 per cent to 18 per cent , because less tissue means lower energy and nutrient needs			2
' inefficient energy : @entity29 suggests more than 50 per cent of greenhouse emissions come from our dependence on livestock farming , based on reports from the @entity187 when questioned about the use of pills or engineering to break humanity 's heavy use of meat in our diet , @entity29 said : ' there is a widely cited @entity198 report that estimates that 18 per cent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions and @entity202 equivalents come from livestock farming , which is actually a much higher share than from transportation			1
' more recently it 's been suggested that livestock farming accounts for as much as 51 per cent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions			2
' and then there are estimates that as much as 9 per cent of human emissions occur as a result of deforestation for the expansion of pastures for livestock			0
' and that does n't even to take into account the emissions that arise from manure , or from the livestock directly			0
' since a large portion of these cows and other grazing animals are raised for consumption , it seems obvious that reducing the consumption of these meats could have considerable environmental benefits			0
' ' i think it 's important to note that it would n't necessarily need to be a pill			0
we have also toyed around with the idea of a patch that might stimulate the immune system to reject common bovine proteins , which could lead to a similar kind of lasting aversion to meat products			0

@entity30 professor suggests we genetically engineer babies to be smaller and more ' energy - efficient '
other suggestions to save the planet *include* making humans intolerant to meat through pills or patches
' the @entity76 , has not produced demonstrable reductions in global emissions '
authors of study stress they are not advocating the ideas , just opening the debate up for radical cures
