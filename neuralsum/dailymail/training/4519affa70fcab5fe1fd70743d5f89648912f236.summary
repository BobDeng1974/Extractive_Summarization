by @entity1 reporter published : 10:18 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 17:36 est , 18 january 2013 @entity3 football star @entity2 kept up the charade that his beloved girlfriend had died even after learning it was a hoax , but claims he did it for the sake of his teammates as they prepared for the national title game , it was revealed today			1
@entity2 , whose story of losing his love , @entity13 , during the season endeared him to a nation of fans , has said he found out on december 6 that @entity19 in fact never even existed back when he received a phone call from ' @entity19			1
' but just two days later , he repeated the bogus line that his girlfriend died after battling leukemia to a website in @entity25 , @entity26 , where the prestigious university is based			1
he has told friends that he did to protect his teammates who were preparing for the national title			1
' i mean , i do n’t like cancer at all			1
i lost both my grandparents and my girlfriend to cancer			1
so i ’ve really tried to go to children ’s hospitals and see , you know , children , ' the linebacker said to @entity44 during an interview where he discussed his chances of winning the @entity47 , college football 's most honored award			1
and on december 11 , @entity2 told the @entity49 of @entity50 , @entity51 , on dec. 11 why he played just days after @entity52 supposedly died in september			1
' she made me promise , when it happened , that i would stay and play , ' he said			2
@entity2 , who is considered a top prospect in this year 's @entity57 draft , did n't tell school officials until december 26			2
he has been telling friends that he kept the shocking news to himself because he did n't want to cause a distraction as @entity3 prepared to take on @entity63 for the national championship , @entity59 said			1
during the 20 - day gap , @entity2 , who has also said in interviews how he met @entity52 in person , agonized over what to do before finally coming clean with his coaches , sources told @entity59			1
one of the images of ' @entity13 ' who supposedly died in september after battling @entity74 @entity2 says he only learned @entity52 was n't real on december 6 when he received a phone call from her cellphone , approximately three months after she died			1
in a press conference on wednesday night , @entity3 athletic director @entity77 said that @entity2 was the victim of online predators who took advantage of the athlete 's generosity and kindness			1
@entity77 pointed to the documentary film catfish and an @entity87 program of the same name in explaining how easy it can be to fool somebody into believing an online relationship is real			0
but journalists , including one of the reporters at @entity95 that broke the initial story , have called that story into question			0
' it takes a great deal of faith if you ’re going to believe that @entity2 actually spent an entire year with a girlfriend that he never met and that he never had any video chat with , ' the @entity95 reporter , @entity100 , said on the today show			2
@entity100 dug into @entity2 's story to discover that his girlfriend never existed			2
he believes @entity2 was in on the ruse , saying , ' it takes a great deal of faith ' to think @entity2 did n't know the truth			2
in numerous published reports , @entity2 said that while this past season has brought many triumphs to his life , there were also twin tragedies - the deaths of his 72 - year - old grandmother and his girlfriend , @entity13 , within a day of each other			1
a comprehensive investigation by @entity95 found that while his grandmother did indeed die on september 12 , 2012 , @entity13 did not - nor did she even exist			1
the school conducted its own investigation and found that @entity2 had been taken for a ride by what @entity77 calls a sophisticated hoax orchestrated by ' a remarkable number of characters - both male and female			2
' he said : ' it was real to @entity2			0
there was no suspicion that it was n’t			0
the pain was real , the grief was real , the affection was real - and that 's the nature of this sad cruel game			2
' ' this is incredibly embarrassing to talk about , but over an extended period of time , i developed an emotional relationship with a woman i met online , ' @entity2 said in a statement			0
' we maintained what i thought to be an authentic relationship by communicating frequently online and on the phone , and i grew to care deeply about her			0
' @entity3 athletic director @entity77 told the media wednesday that @entity2 was the victim of an elaborate prank perpetrated by others			1
however , he stopped short of saying he had ever met her in person or correcting reports that said he had , though he did on numerous occasions talk about how special the relationship was to him			0
when she was said to be sick in the hospital , @entity163 would phone her and stay on the line with her as they slept , waking up eight hours later to find her still breathing on the other line			0
and it seems the joke is far from over after someone tweeted from @entity13 's @entity174 account late last night			1
@entity175 , who tweets under the username @entity177 , joked about her and even said he was ' running her profile ' last december			2
he has even said on @entity174 that he knew it was all a hoax back in 2008			0
@entity175 claims at that point that he severed all ties with @entity183 , who is the main suspect of being the person behind @entity13 , even though she did not actually exist			1
@entity183 , left , is believed to be the main person behind the hoax			0
@entity175 has claimed he severed ties with him but joked on @entity174 last december that he ' was running her profile			2
' among the evidence collected in @entity3 's independent investigation was ' online chatter ' that showed some people knew about the prank and were ' taking joy in it , ' @entity77 said			1
@entity175 , who tweets under the username @entity194 , said last month that the story was a hoax			0
@entity175 puts the blame on the hoax on @entity199			0
@entity3 athletic director has said others took pleasure in perpetuating the hoax			1
on the night of the @entity205 title game , one @entity174 user , @ @entity177 posted : ' i wonder if the real @entity13 is watching the game			1
. cause i know the fake one that did n't die is not watching over the @entity211 ! ' but despite the university 's claims , there is still substantial doubt that @entity2 could have been fooled so easily - and for so long			0
' it ’s tough for me			0
i want to believe that @entity2 is a smart kid			0
playing linebacker for the @entity218 requires a certain amount of smarts , and it would take a pretty , i guess , clueless guy to fall for this for that long			2
i guess that ’s where my skepticism lies , ' @entity100 said			0
and @entity226 sports columnist @entity225 said the case has ' left everyone wondering whether this was really the case of a naïve football player done wrong by friends or a fabrication that has yet to play to its conclusion			0
' @entity236 , national columnist for @entity237 , was more blunt with assessment			0
' nothing about this story has been comprehensible , or logical , and that extends to what happens next , ' he wrote			0
' i can not comprehend @entity2 saying anything that could make me believe he was a victim			0

the star @entity3 linebacker says he found out on december 6 that @entity13 did not exist
two days later , he gave interview saying his ' girlfriend died of cancer '
made another mention three days later
sources said he agonized over whether to tell his coaches the truth as the team prepared to take on @entity63 in the national championship game
