set in five acres , it has a wealth of period features and elegantly grand rooms - and is around 35 times the size of the average @entity58 home			2
the stamp duty bill from a £ 7.1million purchase would be enough to buy the mansion - and it has been given an attractive price because it is ‘ so big ’			2
estate agent @entity62 said : ‘ if it was a tenth of the size it would probably still be the same price so you ’re basically getting 90 per cent free			0

it is being offered leasehold and only has 92 years left on its lease - with any buyer expected to pay a further £ 300 per year in ground rent and maintenance charges			1
the garage has been put up for sale with @entity108 estate agent @entity107			0
but it is not the most expensive one of its kind			0

' while it is out of the reach for most of us mere mortals , i am sure someone will see it as a reasonable price ' @entity149 , property expert ‘ purely its location alone , moments from @entity153 and @entity15 , makes this garage a valuable asset			2
@entity81 is surrounded by very high value residential properties , the vast majority of which do not have either off - street parking or a garage			2
’ @entity81 has an average house value of £ 1.7million , which is much less than the average asking price in its postcode of @entity163 of £ 3.9million			1
@entity149 , a buying agent and property expert , added : ‘ while it is out of the reach for most of us mere mortals , i am sure someone will see it as a reasonable price			0
’ the @entity108 garage is not the only @entity1 lock - up with a hefty asking price			1

in 2010 , a dilapidated row of storage units in @entity183 went on the market with a whopping £ 1.25million asking price			0
but the new owner could rest assured that they would own property in the same trendy area as @entity190			0
in 2012 a 20ft - long garage went on the market for £ 525,000 , but that was because of its pricey postcode in @entity195 - home to @entity196 and some of the world 's richest people			2
in october 2013 a double garage sold in @entity200 sold for a cool £ 251,000			0
