' i dropped some on my shirt and went to brush it off and felt a lump			0
' i had never noticed it before			0

' they referred me to @entity50 and i had an appointment later that day , ' said mrs @entity5			1

breast lumps are common and have a number of different causes - and 90 per cent of them are benign			1
although most lumps are n't breast cancer , any unusual changes to the breasts should be checked by a gp as soon as possible , explain experts writing for the @entity107 website			1
if your gp finds a lump on examination , they will routinely refer you to be seen by a hospital specialist			0
while 90 per cent of breast lumps are benign , experts stress it 's important to be breast aware and take note of any changes or warning signs there are several types of benign ( non-cancerous ) breast lump , most of which are harmless and are caused by hormonal changes that occur at different times in a woman 's life , such as during the menstrual cycle			2
common types of benign breast lump include : * a fibroadenoma – a firm lump that moves around easily in the breast and is more common in younger women * a breast cyst – a smooth , firm fluid - filled lump most commonly seen in women aged 30 to 60 * a breast abscess – a painful collection of pus that forms under the skin of the breast , usually as the result of a bacterial infection the website advice stresses it 's important to be ' breast aware ' so you can identify any problems in your breasts and get them checked out as soon as possible			2
this means being familiar with your breasts and what is normal for them , and examining them regularly for any changes			0
if you are 50 years or over , it 's also important to attend breast cancer screening appointments every three years			0
but do n't wait until your next screening appointment if you notice any problems in your breast			0
you also should see your gp if you notice any other changes to one or both of your breasts , such as : * an area of thickened tissue * nipple discharge , which may contain blood * a change in the size or shape of your breasts * dimpling on the skin of your breasts * a rash on or around your nipples * a change in your nipple 's appearance – for example , becoming sunken into your breast * persistent pain in your breasts or armpits * a lump or swelling in your armpits source : @entity107			2
