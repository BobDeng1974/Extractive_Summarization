by @entity0 this is the moment an inquisitive squirrel was spotted taking time out to smell the daisies			1
the curious creature could n't resist sniffing some local @entity6 flowers as it made its way through fields near @entity9 , @entity10			1
but while it might look like its simply taking the time to appreciate the summer blooms - the squirrel was in fact on the hunt for the tastiest flower of the bunch			2
that smells nice ! the squirrel stands up on its hind legs , grasping the stem with its paws , and takes a sniff of the daisies			2
the moment was captured as the inquisitive squirrel scampered across a field in @entity9 , @entity10 seen pulling the plant towards its nose , the rarely - seen animal was captured by @entity10 photographer , @entity31 , 23 , who was hiding in the bushes nearby			1
reaching out with a tiny paw , the squirrel is first seen bending the stem closer , before bringing the blooms to its nose with a gentle tug			0
after sniffing the individual flowers , the squirrel decides on the one that smells the best - and leans in for a bite			2
mr @entity31 used a camouflage net to stay hidden from the timid animal			0
@entity46 forced to stay hidden for three hours before catching a glimpse of the endangered @entity49 ground squirrel			1
and he was able to stay still enough to capture the animal in these tender photographs			0
which one ? with a tiny paw , the squirrel brings the buds close enough to touch its nose			0
the photographer captured the incredible images by lying quietly on his stomach in some nearby bushes for three hours lunchtime ! after spending time sniffing out its favourite one , the hungry squirrel takes a bite of its pick of the bunch			1
mr @entity31 said the trick to taking photos of the timid creature was to make yourself ' invisible ' mr @entity31 said : ' it was n't an easy task getting these shots , @entity49 ground squirrels are not easy to find , but i knew i just had to be patient and wait			1
' when you want to take professional photos of them you have to be at eye level with the squirrels , that means you have to lay on your stomach for quite a few hour in order to get the squirrels in front of your lens			0
' basically , you have to make yourself invisible , they are extremely timid so you it is important that they have no indication you are there			0
' the moment i saw the ground squirrel reaching for the flower i knew it would be a special and unique shot			1
' i was so pleased with the results , it really does look as if it is smelling the flowers but of course it is searching for some lunch			0
' those few shots are some of my favourite pictures i 've ever taken and i feel lucky to have them in my own photo collection			0
