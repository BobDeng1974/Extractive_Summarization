by @entity0 @entity1 , one of the largest ice caps in the world , is moving much faster than expected			1
this is according to the recent satellite images which reveal what scientists describe as ‘ extraordinary ’ changes in the region			0
the ice cap , which had been relatively stable for years , is located on @entity13 's @entity12 region and covers just over 3,000 square miles ( 8,000 sq km )			1
@entity1 , one of the largest ice caps in the world , is moving much faster than expected			2
pictured on the bottom right is a satellite image from @entity17 which reveals the region on the move in red launch : 3 april 2014 at @entity22 , @entity23 life : minimum of seven years mass : 2300 kg ( 5070 lbs ) instrument : c - band synthetic aperture radar dimensions : 9.2ft ( 2.8m ) long , 8.2ft ( 2.5m ) wide , 13ft ( 4m ) high mission : monitoring sea ice , oil spills , winds and waves , land - use change and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquake a combination of measurements by @entity44 ’s @entity43 last and @entity40 ’s @entity39 satellite recently revealed a dramatic acceleration in ice motion			1
the movement is in the south eastern section , which is now flowing at least 10 times faster than previously measured , claim scientists			1
researchers had believed the @entity52 's @entity51 was losing substantial amounts of ice through its major glacier at @entity56			2
these images confirm that theory			0
‘ we 've observed @entity1 with various satellite radar datasets over the past 20 years , and it has n't done very much , ’ professor @entity59 from @entity60 told the @entity61			2
the movement is in the south eastern section ( pictured ) which is now flowing at least 10 times faster than previously measured , claim scientists @entity1 , which has been relatively stable for years , is located on @entity13 's @entity12 region and covers just over 3,000 square miles ( 8,000 square km ) ‘ but we 've now looked at it again with the new @entity68 , and it 's clear it has speeded up quite considerably in the last two or three years			1
’ together , the @entity72 and @entity73 ice sheets contain more than 99 per cent of the freshwater ice on @entity75			0
ice sheets are constantly moving , slowly flowing downhill under their own weight			0
but long as an ice sheet accumulates the same mass of snow as it loses to the sea , it remains stable			2
@entity43 's ability to ' see ' through cloud and rain and in pitch darkness make it particularly useful for monitoring sea ice @entity43 ’s ability to ‘ see ’ through cloud and rain and in pitch darkness make it particularly useful for monitoring sea ice			0
images from its advanced radar can be used to distinguish clearly between the thinner more navigable first - year ice and the hazardous , much thicker multi-year ice			0
a detailed report on @entity1 and the possible causes of the speed - up is now being prepared for publication in a science journal			1
' it remains to be seen whether the abrupt speed - up reflects natural variability in the ice cap motion , or whether it is a symptom of regional climate change , ' said @entity44			1

the huge @entity1 ice cap is located in @entity13 's @entity12 region
its dramatic movement was spied in the ice cap 's south eastern section
the increase in ice movement has taken place over last two to three years
' it remains to be seen whether the abrupt speed - up reflects natural variability or whether it is a symptom of regional climate change , ' said @entity44
