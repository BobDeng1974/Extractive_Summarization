by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:34 est , 29 november 2013 @entity3 : 16:24 est , 29 november 2013 the demise of @entity5 was deemed inevitable , with scientists around the world saying it would disintegrate as it flew close to the sun. however , the latest images from @entity11 and the @entity12 suggest that the comet , or at least fragments of it , may have survived			1
at around 6.35pm gmt on thursday , the so - called ' comet of the century ' was spotted on a trajectory towards the sun before seeming to disappear			1
yet , shortly afterwards bright lights were spotted that some scientists have claimed could be the comet 's nucleus			1
shortly afterwards bright lights ( pictured top left ) were spotted that some scientists have claimed could be the comet 's nucleus fire in the sky : in this frame grab taken from an enhanced video made by @entity11 's @entity33 - a spacecraft , comet @entity5 , left , approaches the sun on november 25			1
@entity5 , which was discovered a year ago , was closest to the sun on thursday ' initially when something came out ( after close approach ) , we thought this is just the dust trail and there 's not much left , it 's just going to fade away , ' astronomer @entity36 told @entity42			1
' and then images keep coming in and ... the last few , it seems pretty definitely like it 's getting brighter			0
so we do not have a good answer as to what 's going on			0
' some scientists feared the delicate comet had already started to disintegrate , even before it grazed the ' surface ' of the sun , 1.2 million kilometres away			1
dr @entity51 , an expert in astronomy at @entity53 , told @entity54 that when the comet entered the sun 's hottest outer layers it was exposed to a temperature of several million degrees			2
some scientists feared the delicate comet ( pictured , bottom right , as it approached the sun ) had already started to disintegrate , even before it grazed the ' surface ' of the sun , 1.2 million kilometres away the bottom image shows @entity5 blazing towards the sun on thursday morning			1
by almost 1pm it is captured looking faded , pictured top here , @entity5 is shown entering the field of view of the @entity12 and @entity11 's @entity68 on november 27			2
in this picture , called a coronagraph , the bright light of the sun itself is blocked so the structures around it are visible			0
the comet is seen in the lower right @entity5 was discovered by two amateur @entity79 astronomers in 2012 and travelled within 730,000 miles of the sun on thursday @entity5 entered the view of @entity11 's @entity33 on 21 november , where it could be seen with @entity83 , @entity84 and comet @entity86 earlier this week , @entity11 released a high - resolution image of the streaking comet that looked like a swimming tadpole			1
it was captured by the h - 1 camera on board @entity11 's @entity33 on november 21			0
@entity11 said @entity5 , which is officially labelled as @entity5 , appeared to still be intact in its video and can be seen in these images along with @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity93			1
the tails streaking out from behind both comets can be seen moving along with the steady stream of particles - called the solar wind - that flows out from the sun. a composite image from the @entity104 's @entity103 telescope in @entity105 shows @entity5 streaking toward the sun on nov. 15			1
the image combines four different 30 - second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths if it has survived , @entity5 , pronounced @entity112 ' - sahn , should be visible with the naked eye through december , at least from the @entity114			1
@entity115 at times in november with ordinary binoculars and occasionally even just the naked eye , it already has dazzled observers and is considered the most scrutinised comet ever by @entity11			0
but the best is , potentially , yet to come if the comet really has survived its solar flyby			2
dr @entity51 told @entity54 : ' this close encounter with the sun offers a unique opportunity for astronomers to analyse the composition of a comet			2
comets are icy , dusty snowballs - the remains from the formation of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago			0
' the long tail containing the material frozen in the comet and released through the heat of the sun offers astronomers the chance to identify different elements			1
' it has already been bright enough for astronomers to capture amazing pictures			0
however , if the comet survives its burning close encounter with the sun it may have a huge and impressively long tail with a brightness that might make it an easy to spot object even with the naked eye			2
@entity5 , which has been dubbed the ' comet of the century ' , has been visible to the naked eye this month			1
@entity157 amateur astronomer @entity155 recorded this image from @entity159 , in @entity157 , on 16 november ' this happened in 1965 with the comet @entity161 that had an enormously long tail ; but some comets , like @entity165 three years ago , have been ripped apart during their close encounter by the sun 's gravitational force			2
' the magic limit for survival of the comet seems to be the size , which has to exceed 2 km so it does not get boiled away or ripped apart by the sun. @entity5 is estimated to be that size , so we should all cross our fingers and await our early @entity180 comet , ' he said			2
the place to see the ‘ comet of the century ’ is in a clear dark sky where the horizon is unobstructed , such as in the countryside			2
it can be seen with the naked eye , but binoculars will highlight details such as its tail , streamers and bumps in the surface			0
it should be seen before dawn in the eastern sky			0
@entity5 passed within 1.2 million miles of the sun ’s surface yesterday at around 18:35 gmt. detected just over a year ago , the comet is passing through the inner solar system for the first time			1
still fresh , this comet is thought to bear the pristine matter of the beginning of our solar system			0
it 's believed to be straight from the @entity209 cloud on the fringes of the solar system , which is home to countless icy bodies - most notably the frozen balls of dust and gas in orbit around the sun known as comets			0
for whatever reason , @entity5 was propelled out of this cloud and drawn toward the heart of the solar system by the sun 's intense gravitational pull			2
the closer the comet gets to the sun , the faster it gets and in january , it was clocked at 40,000 mph ( 64,000 kph )			0
by last thursday , the comet had accelerated to 150,000 mph ( 240,000 kph ) but by the time @entity5 slingshots around the sun , it will be moving at a mind - boggling 828,000 mph ( 1,332,000 kph )			1
the comet , top right , has so far been photographed through telescopes and long exposures but is expected to be visible to the naked eye throughout december - if it has survived			0
it could be the brightest for 100 years the comet has been creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle of late as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail whether it has survived or is torn apart , humans have nothing to fear			0
the comet will venture no closer to us than about 40 million miles ( 64 million kilometres ) , less than half the distance between @entity83 and the sun. the closest approach to @entity83 will occur on @entity252 - if the comet has survived			0
then it will head away in the opposite direction forever , given its anticipated trajectory			0
@entity5 is named after the @entity257 , used by a pair of @entity79 astronomers to detect the comet in september 2012 , but it officially is known as @entity5 , which indicates when it was discovered			1
take heart : the ' c ' means it is not expected here again .			0

at around 6.35pm gmt the @entity5 flew towards the sun
astronomers predicted the heat would cause it to disintegrate and initial images appeared to *confirm* this
yet shortly after the flyby *unusual* lights were seen suggesting otherwise
scientists are now *unsure* what happened to the ' comet of the century '
