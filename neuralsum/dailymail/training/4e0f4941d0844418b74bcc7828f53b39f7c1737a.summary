@entity0 may have come out fighting against his growing number of detractors this week but the cold , hard truth is that @entity4 remain staggeringly short of what 's required			1
while staunch supporters of the @entity7 will point towards yet another season in the @entity10 knockout stages , a glance at the @entity13 table shows just how short they 've been since august			1
the @entity14 are astonishingly 12 points worse off today than they were at this stage last season when , heading into @entity18 , @entity0 found himself top of the tree			2
@entity0 ( pictured after defeat at @entity21 last weekend ) has seen his @entity4 side struggle this year @entity24 's goal for the @entity25 went to show how far the @entity14 have fallen away compared to last season @entity26 find themselves a staggering 14 points better off in the @entity13 @entity29 's @entity28 has some questions to answer after finding it difficult to pick up where he left off @entity34 's @entity33 have endured a difficult start to the season after the highs of last year that lead was cut in the end - @entity4 finished fourth - and what 's followed has been definite regression			1
but they are n't the only ones			0
the @entity44 pair @entity29 and @entity33 have dropped a combined 19 points from this time last season			1
@entity28 , heralded as the man who has the stylish brand of football to drag the @entity29 into the top four , has struggled ; @entity29 have conceded far too many goals			2
red legend @entity53 pulled no punches after they were dumped out of @entity55 , but the domestic form is actually more of a concern			0
‘ if things do n’t change then ultimately @entity52 will pay the price , ’ he said			0
and you do wonder whether @entity61 is getting twitchy with @entity62 at @entity63 already , given their negative six - point swing			0
for others , however , the comparisons are very welcome indeed			0
none more so than @entity68 , who will be crowing at an incredible 14 - point difference in their tallies			2
this time last year the @entity26 were fourth - bottom and @entity68 was for the chop			1
now they find themselves in the top four and - perhaps more strikingly - comfortably in the @entity55 running , four points ahead of @entity4 down in sixth			1
@entity78 might have a case to be pleased after accumulating seven additional points in 2013 - 14 , but looking at where they were last year - rock bottom with just eight points - @entity85 wo n't draw too many conclusions			2
interestingly , the high - flying @entity87 and @entity88 are just a win away from the same totals - suggesting they are at home in the upper echelons of the top flight			0
it 's @entity0 who wo n't want to look			0
what a difference a year makes			0
@entity96 are six points better off under @entity98 than they were with @entity99 the signing of @entity102 striker @entity101 has boosted @entity104 's points haul at this stage of the season @entity107 laments defence and decisions			1

@entity4 were top of the @entity13 after *15* games last season
@entity68 's @entity26 are 14 points better off this year
@entity96 , @entity117 and @entity104 have all improved
@entity29 and @entity33 are also struggling comparatively
