@entity6 , 45 , went on a diet when a doctor bluntly told her she was obese			1
until then she had been completely oblivious how heavy she had become			2
' i looked in the mirror i saw a thin woman			2
in my heart of hearts i knew i was overweight but thought i looked all right , ' she told @entity14			2
then and now : @entity6 was comfort eating for years before she lost weight and became a body builder @entity6 ’s weight started to creep up when she had her first child at 18			1

i was constantly running around after my kids and snacking , so i did n’t register what i was eating			2
' my husband loved me when i was fat			2
every saturday morning he went out and bought me six pastries , which i used to eat with a cup of tea in bed			2
i knew if i had one i could quite easily eat a dozen			2
' pictured here at a wedding reception held after her daughter 's wedding , @entity6 hates looking at old photographs she ruptured two discs after her last son was born while bending over to pick him up			1
@entity6 says : ' the doctor told me it was to do with my weight			1
i got quite offended , and said ‘ are you saying i ’m fat ’ but i did n’t see myself as fat			2
' the turning point for @entity6 came when she had to lose pounds before she could undergo surgery			1
' about five months before the surgery , the doctors told me i was obese			1
' i did n’t understand			2
the doctor showed me all these charts and all i could hear was ‘ you ’re obese ’ over and over again			1
it was like somebody had broken a spell , that the thin woman i saw when i looked in the mirror , was now a fat woman looking back			0
' by writing down everything she ate and drink per day , @entity6 was able to see how her weight had ballooned this was the wake up call @entity6 said she needed			1

' i knew i had to lose a couple of stone before the operation , but i decided i may as well get down to the weight i wanted to be			0
' my gp told me to write down every single thing i ate and drank for two weeks			0
that was an eye opener			0
he told me my portion sizes were unbelievable			0
for example i would be eating half a pie with four potatoes			0
' at first , @entity6 lost a stone through diet alone and then joined @entity109 and met her personal trainer @entity110 , who changed her life			1
weight battles : @entity6 with her youngest daughter @entity113 eleven years ago hooked on sport : the adrenaline of competing made @entity6 keep going back for more aged 43 , @entity6 wore a bikini for the first time since she was a teenager her first goal was to run five kilometres for a charity run in memory of her father , who had recently passed away			1
she says : '' my dad was my best friend			0
he was always on my case about losing weight , and my biggest regret is that he never got to see me at my best , he would have been so proud			0
so i did the race for him			0
following the buzz of competing and finishing in just 26 minutes , @entity6 was hooked on exercise			1
' i pushed myself so hard , that after i ran through the finish line , i fell to my knees			0
i had this real adrenaline rush and i really liked it , ' she says			0
' a few weeks after that i was talking to some friends at the gym and they suggested i enter a body building competition			0
i thought they were taking the mickey			0
joanna with her personal trainer , @entity110 , who she says has changed her life forever ' i knew i was n’t in shape for a body building competition , but i had seven months to get in shape			0
