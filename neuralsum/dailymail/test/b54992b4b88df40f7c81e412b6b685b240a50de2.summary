take me to the lands where the eyes are cooled … there are dreams i will leave everything behind for everything that has meaning in my life came to life with the introduction to my lord to the @entity129 of my lord to the @entity130 of his evermore than i can implore … i have memories of soldiers of @entity134 , memories of soldiers of shaytan memories of battlegrounds i have n't yet stepped on memories of battlefields i have never stepped on … @entity134 , take me – @entity140 lirabbil aalameen take me … to the lands where the eyes are cooled @entity143 lies unpursued i remind myself these sacrifies are only for you , too few hunger never felt so good as it does handcuffed some of us are born soldiers , battle runs through our blood the sound of gun rattle sends a rush , soothing i sleep with my eyes open , my subconscious constantly invoking @entity157 ! @entity159 ! … my mind strays back to golden past i have n't yet lived … all this time i spent living @entity162 dreams instead surrounded by walls of marble with widescreens , gardens of plush green pouring rain splashing on window panes , crystal ceilings but @entity171 , nafsi only knew of empty feelings verily , time teases			0
the tease of martyrdom when the ruh leaves in degrees ; the degrees every soul dreams to seize the degrees the angels appease one over another the degrees of infinite seas with which the @entity183 pleads , the seven seas can not encumber i drown in ghibtah rage for a cavalry of my own plotting against shaytaan , suffocating for self - control i want to be purified with every breath , every sweat , every echo , every harakah the innumerable @entity192 , the countless du'at , every step i take , i 'm back at @entity195 i have work to do			0
mistakes to correct , time to make up			0
no excuse to sit back and wait - for the skies rain martyrdom wait , no ! the skies never rain martyrdom … martyrdom rains the skies ! this world is a morgue on standstill watching the lost souls in a cold , silent , blank stare – death stare death stirs in cold , silent , despair finding no place to call home , my vision blurs all my fingers plucked out , my veins stretched to dull @entity218 poking into my sleep … into my dreams peeling laughter – the never - ending discourse of @entity224 's regime @entity225 … silenced			0
prison walls that scream the urges reincarnate into rebellion , into physical hunger , social incompetency i am a slithering soul cringing to be free the sweat of my efforts choke , wet strokes of vapour from a cloud for my dreams to emerge … on cracked canvas – chipping off paint the pigments of a lost nation			0
a soliciting child soliciting for a while for golden signs … along the @entity253 , @entity254 , miles from with a defied conscience eager for recompense … the mountains are my castles , the sand is my sea i peril through the wilderness as it 's a part of me i hear voices in the dark ; feel pressure on my prayer rug as i swing on a hammock between date palms , i drop bombs i feel blisters beneath my feet as i sneak behind the enemy fleet i fall sleep in the midst of battle before sirens and tanks owned by enemy ranks hit cloud nine with the smell of turpentine , nations wiped clean of filthy shrines my teeth grind , my gums sting , my jaws flinch from and flame in chemical pain and from all this			0
i confess i 've become more sane my backbones sprain from the tensions of unresolved game i refuse to return home ! thrust open my wounds where my nerves have ruined rupture my skin where my membranes bare thinned tear my limbs that resist in abstinence here - taste @entity303 through fists and slit throats – and prefer this over death from slit wrists , pills , drunk and doped thank me later , for now , do what you will – let the noise persist ! running in half excitement , half regret , index finger to sky , a bulletproof vest i turn around – what can my enemies do to me if @entity2 has promised me success ? i waken with moistened eyes , tired and high off of unresolved life some dreams seem like real life ; sometimes , life seems like a dream @entity328 steel from the greedy the remnants of my fitrah and run into the dungeon of death @entity333 awaits ! source			0
