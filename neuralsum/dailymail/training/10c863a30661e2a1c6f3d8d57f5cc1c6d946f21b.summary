the 21 men and nine women , all @entity3 , were found guilty of drug trafficking , while a further 59 defendants were handed sentences ranging up to life in prison			1
each appeared flanked by two police officers at the mass trial in @entity18 province , which was held in the yard of a detention centre , rather than a courtroom			1
' this was @entity3 's largest ever trial in terms of defendants , the number of death penalties given out and the amount of heroin involved , ' presiding judge @entity26 said after the verdict was read out in the northern province of @entity18 - which borders @entity31			1
justice en masse : some 89 defendants are each flanked by two police officers as they are sentenced for heroin smuggling after @entity3 's biggest - ever drugs trial ' because of the large number of defendants and the seriousness of the case , the trial was held at the prison , ' mr @entity26 added after the 17 - day trial			1
investigators said the defendants belonged to four international smuggling rings responsible for trafficking heroin and other drugs from neighbouring @entity48 into @entity3 and @entity31 since 2006			1
' all the defendants are @entity3 and most of them came from @entity3 's northwestern provinces , ' court clerk @entity49 told @entity53			1
@entity3 's remote northwestern region , which borders both @entity31 and @entity48 , is poor and populated by a patchwork of ethnic minority groups			1
there have been previous smuggling cases in the area , which is far from the control of @entity61			0
according to a list of the defendants ' names seen by @entity53 , some of the 89 people were from ethnic minority groups but court officials could not confirm their status			2
facing lethal injection : judges condemned 30 people to death for their part in trafficking the 12 - ton haul one of the leaders of the four smuggling rings broken up by the police remains at large , state media reported			1
police disrupted the rings in august 2013 , making mass arrests and seizing large quantities of illegal drugs			2
they also confiscated 20 luxury cars and dozens of guns and other weapons during the raid , state media reported			0
communist @entity3 has some of the world 's toughest anti-drug laws			0
anyone found guilty of possessing more than 600 grams ( 21 ounces ) of heroin , or more than 20 kilograms of opium , can face the death penalty			0
convictions and sentences are usually revealed only by local media , which is strictly under state control			0
@entity102 received life in jail and 46 were given either prison terms of up to 20 years , or warnings , the government said in a statement on its internet site the ' @entity110 ' region covering part of @entity48 , @entity112 and @entity113 was formerly one of the world 's top producers of opium and heroin but has been overtaken by @entity119			1
after a two - year hiatus in carrying out capital punishment due to problems procuring chemicals for lethal injections , @entity3 executed its first prisoner by the method last august			0
the country currently now has more than 700 prisoners on death row , according to media reports and an @entity53 tally			0
many have been sentenced for drug offences including dozens of foreigners - although it has been decades since a foreign citizen was executed			0
although @entity3 does not release statistics on executions , rights group @entity137 recorded 86 new death sentences in 2012 while it said five executions were carried out the previous year			2
@entity137 said it was ' dismayed ' to learn about the sentences , which come on top of recent death sentences handed out in high - profile corruption and embezzlement cases			0
' @entity137 opposes the death penalty in all cases , without exception , ' @entity147 , its researcher on @entity148 , @entity48 and @entity3 , told @entity53			2
' rather than continuing to hand down death sentences , the @entity3 authorities should be moving towards abolition , in line with the global trend , ' he added			2
due to problems with both procuring and producing domestically the chemicals required for lethal injections , some lawmakers have called for a return to executions by firing squad .			0
