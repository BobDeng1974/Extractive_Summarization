by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 on the day that @entity2 played his first @entity4 match since @entity6 ’s exit from his coaching box it was interesting to note the presence of a former @entity11 champion seated several rows behind the support team that remains			1
@entity14 , the winner at @entity15 in 2006 , braved the chill wind to spend the whole match watching him defeat @entity20 ’s @entity19 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 and stayed to watch the on - court interview afterwards too			1
she was only yards away from @entity2 ’s girlfriend @entity23 and , amid all the speculation about who will be brought in to replace @entity6 , you could only wonder if she might become another significant woman in his life			1
watching on : former @entity11 champion @entity14 watched @entity2 in action on tuesday according to one credible source mauresmo and the @entity32 no 1 have been talking about the post , and while the only person who can make the choice is @entity2 himself , the idea of him bringing her on board in some capacity might not be totally fanciful			1
@entity2 , who has always been prepared to think outside the tramlines , is on record as saying that he would consider a woman as his coach , which some thought might be a reference to @entity47			1
yet @entity14 actually has experience of coaching a man			2
in 2010 she worked with the experienced @entity51 player @entity50 and she knows the pressures of being a world no 1 , having also won the @entity54			1
currently she works as @entity51 @entity56 captain , which takes a few weeks per year , and she is also in close contact with the game through work in the @entity51 media			2
@entity2 has hinted that he has identified someone he would at least like to try out			2
last night he was vague about his plans while suggesting that something might be in the air			0
‘ it ’s not something that ’s distracting me right now , so it ’s not been a problem so far , ’ he said			0
focused : @entity2 returns a powerful backhand on his way to victory over @entity19 making his point : @entity2 celebrates winning a valuable point during his first round match he will need focus when he plays @entity77 ’s @entity76 , the world no 66 who is not keen on his nickname of ‘ @entity81 ’			1
he defeated @entity84 - @entity83 @entity82 in four sets			0
@entity76 is unlikely to be as awkward a prospect as @entity19 , who lived up to his reputation as a flashy groundstroker whose mix of dramatic winners off both sides , coupled with copious shanks , gives his opposition so little rhythm to play with			0
after missing last year with a back injury this was @entity2 ’s first @entity97 appearance since winning the @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity11 , which ought to make him more comfortable			1
there has also been back surgery to ease the problems largely associated with playing on clay			0
frustrated figure : @entity2 reacts after one of his shots is deemed out of play during tuesday 's en apart from @entity19 his biggest irritation yesterday was the overhead cable camera , which kept moving while he was trying to serve			2
that shot caused him problems in the third set , when he was broken three times			0
otherwise it had been a highly impressive beginning and a fairly comprehensive end , although there were times when he should have been more aggressive , as @entity6 always advised			0
‘ i was excited to be back after what happened last year , ’ he said			0
‘ i came here a few weeks ago to practise with @entity120 and after that i was looking forward to it even more			0

@entity2 beat @entity19 in first round at @entity97
@entity14 watched whole match on court @entity127
@entity51 woman is former world no 1 and two - time @entity4 winner
@entity2 has been without a coach since splitting from @entity6
