by @entity0 published : 06:53 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 09:22 est , 20 march 2013 a drunk teenager sparked a 999 rescue operation when she got stuck in a child 's high chair			1
@entity5 , 19 , was partying with friends when they dared her to pose for a picture in the toddler seat			1
she climbed into the metal - framed chair but her legs became wedged forcing her to call emergency services after developing severe pins and needles			1
when a prank goes wrong : @entity5 started to develop severe pins and needles after she got stuck in the chair firefighters used specialist cutting equipment to free @entity5 , who was initially unable to stand up because of blood loss in her legs			1
@entity5 , of @entity20 , @entity21 , said : ' people have been saying they think i 'm stupid but i was drunk			1
' i do not think it was funny that fire engines were called and i do feel bad			2
' but when i was that drunk i did not think about the consequences or what would happen			2
' i thought my friends would get me out			1
they tried pulling it but i just could n't get out			2
' i do wish i did n't do it but when you look back it is funny			2
' this could be awkward : @entity5 climbed into the tiny chair at a house party but unfortunately got stuck crews were called to a property in @entity20 at 11.45pm on sunday and the rescue took about 15 minutes			1
after being released @entity5 , who is unemployed , needed help standing up as the circulation to her legs had been limited			1
she said : ' i phoned the ambulance at first as i did not know who i needed and they told me to phone back for the fire			0
' they had to cut it off as my leg was swelling up			0
' i do n't normally get stuck in things , although i did get my hand stuck in a jam jar the next day			0
' at least i could get out the jam jar ; i could n't get out of the high chair			0
' @entity57 , head of operations at @entity59 , put the incident down to ' youthful exuberance '			0
' she was quite clearly stuck in and was not going to get without the help of fire crews , ' he said			0
' she was reported to be having a party and it was all quite chirpy			0
it probably came about out of youthful exuberance			0
' she was stuck for some time and they did not have the tools to deal with it			0
' we 're certainly not classifying it as a hoax call			1
' standard fire brigade call - outs cost Â£ 250 per hour but mr @entity57 said the cost of this is ' minimal '			2
he said : ' there is a full - time cost of being on duty anyway			0
' crews were not diverted away from any other call and at that time on a sunday a night they would not be doing any training			2
' but some locals criticised miss @entity5 for wasting public funds			1
@entity84 wrote on a local website said : ' i hope she 's sent a hefty bill from @entity59 for wasting time			0
