by @entity0 published : 19:22 est , 17 november 2012 updated : 19:22 est , 17 november 2012 @entity1 and @entity2 have drawn up secret plans for a £ 2 billion ‘ backdoor mansion tax ’ which will clobber prosperous parts of @entity6			1
the chancellor is ready to give in to deputy prime minister mr @entity2 ’s demands for new council tax bands on homes worth more than £ 1 million – in return for freezing welfare benefits			1
but in a damaging @entity15 split , @entity13 is resisting the move , fearing he will be accused of another u-turn and of hammering @entity19 voters in @entity20			1
the prime minister is backed by communities secretary @entity22 , who is in charge of council tax			1
he has destroyed computer records of council tax valuations in a ‘ scorched earth ’ bid to sabotage the plan			2
split : chancellor @entity1 , left , and @entity2 , right , back the plan for new council tax bands but face resistance from @entity13 and @entity22 under the @entity36 proposals , there would be two or three new council tax bands on homes worth over £ 1 million			1
the @entity39 are pushing for one of the bands , applying to properties worth more than £ 2 million , to target the super rich by acting as a ‘ levy ’ equivalent to one per cent of the value of their home each year			1
such a move would be likely to prove highly controversial because , for example , it would mean that a billionaire such as steel magnate @entity50 , who owns a super-luxury £ 250 million house dubbed the @entity53 in @entity55 ’s @entity54 , would find his council tax bill rising from the current £ 2,151.44 a year for the @entity58 property to £ 2.5 million			2
mr @entity1 and mr @entity2 want to unveil the ‘ backdoor mansion tax ’ and welfare freeze in the chancellor ’s @entity59 on december 5			1
the @entity15 trade - off is designed to show that rich and poor are both being forced to share the pain of clearing the nation ’s £ 126 billion deficit			2
the two men tried to include a similar tax on expensive properties in the @entity71 earlier this year , but it was vetoed by a nervous mr @entity13			2
no 10 denies the @entity72 has changed his mind about the plan			0
‘ the prime minister is not a fan of property taxes , ’ said a well - placed source			1
but , extraordinarily , other sources claim mr @entity2 and mr @entity1 are conducting their negotiations outside of the formal ‘ @entity81 ’ , the key decision - making meetings held between mr @entity1 , mr @entity13 , mr @entity2 and chief secretary to the treasury @entity83			1
this time , with an even more pressing need for @entity87 savings , mr @entity2 and mr @entity1 believe they have a better chance of forcing it through			1
new bands : under the @entity36 plan there would be two or three new council tax bands on homes worth over £ 1 million the @entity97 say a welfare freeze , saving a matching £ 2 billion a year , is essential to avoid claims that people on benefits are better off than those in work , many of whom have had their pay frozen – or cut			1
the @entity39 say they will block the welfare freeze – unless mr @entity13 finally agrees to a form of mansion tax , first put forward by @entity109 heavyweight @entity108			1
critics of the new council tax bands say the move is inequitable and impractical			0
it would involve revaluing homes in the current top bands , @entity116 and @entity58 , but not others			0
they say this is unfair because the price of homes in the provinces , such as @entity123 or @entity124 , has been overtaken by homes in @entity55 and the @entity126 , where they have soared since the last council tax revaluation in 1991			0
currently , homes are divided into eight tax bands , ranging from @entity131 ( homes worth £ 40,000 in 1991 ) to @entity58 ( £ 320,001 and above in 1991 )			0
in @entity55 , which would be hit disproportionately hard by the measure , a typical £ 1 million house is placed in @entity116 , the second highest , based on its 1991 value of £ 265,000			0
the top band , @entity58 , starts on average , for houses worth £ 1.2 million			0
in the local authority which last year had the highest council tax , @entity141 upon @entity142 , the taxes charged range from £ 1,062 for @entity131 properties to £ 3,188 for @entity146 right - winger mr @entity22 is vehemently opposed to the council tax shake - up			1
when he took office in 2010 , he scrapped the @entity149 , containing house values – which his aides had dubbed the ‘ @entity154 ’ – on the grounds of budget cuts			0
but it was widely interpreted as an attempt to thwart mr @entity2			0
he argues that it would be particularly unfair to elderly people on low incomes in big houses and those who have bought homes with hard - earned cash			0
he also says a revaluation would cost around £ 260 million , see ‘ snoopers ’ going into homes to revalue them , and take three years to implement fully , with the first bills going out in april 2015 – a month before the may 2015 general election			0
he argues that this would ‘ hammer the aspirational vote ’ and lead to gross geographical discrimination because of varying regional trends in property prices			0
opponents of the move also say that it makes a mockery of vows by mr @entity13 and mr @entity1 not to introduce a mansion tax			1
@entity180 : the type of £ 1 million - plus home that could be hit by the proposals mr @entity1 ’s allies deny it is a mansion tax , arguing it is ‘ an extension of the council tax ’			1
a @entity19 source said : ‘ it is untrue to call this a mansion tax			1
it will not be popular with some of our supporters but we have always said the well - off will pay more tax			0
no one could claim we are being unfair on the rich if we manage to freeze welfare benefits			2
the @entity15 is about compromises			0
’ mr @entity2 sees it as a chance to restore his standing with his party after his u-turn on university tuition fees			2
one @entity39 mp said : ‘ a mansion tax would be a legacy @entity210 could be proud of			2
’ mr @entity1 told @entity211 as recently as last month : ‘ we are not going to have a mansion tax , or a new tax that is a percentage value of people ’s properties			1
‘ before the election they will call it a mansion tax , but people will wake up the day after the @entity217 and discover suddenly their more modest home has been labelled a mansion			2
we do n’t think people who have worked hard , saved up to buy a home , should be clobbered with a mansion tax			2
’ he dismissed a new council tax band for big houses as a ‘ tax snoopers ’ charter ’ , adding : ‘ you would have to send inspectors out and it would n’t raise much money			0
i ’m not going to let the tax inspectors get their foot in the door			0
’ the first hint of a u-turn came when mr @entity13 said last month : ‘ we are going to take further action to make sure the wealthiest people in our country pay their fair share towards deficit reduction			2
’ @entity19 mp @entity244 told @entity211 : ‘ a freeze in welfare is long overdue but it is wrong for the @entity39 to use it to demand any kind of mansion tax			1
@entity13 is right to resist it			0
’ but fellow mp @entity252 , who runs the @entity253 , backs the @entity36 council tax plan			0
‘ the driving force behind this is that we want to see a benefit freeze , ’ he said .			0

chancellor @entity1 and deputy prime minister @entity2 are backing plans for £ 2 billion ' backdoor mansion tax '
pair have agreed plan in return for freezing welfare benefits
