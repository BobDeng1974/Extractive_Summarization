@entity0 seems to be getting a bit carried away in training ahead of the most important match of his life			0
the @entity6 superstar would have been forgiven for taking it easy before sunday 's @entity9 final against @entity10 as his country need him on top form			1
but , instead , the 27 - year - old executed an overhead kick as the @entity6 stars played a game of foot volley			1
steady on : @entity0 ( centre ) does a bicycle kick at training ahead of the @entity9 final @entity6 will be encouraged that @entity0 is looking so energetic after claims from the superstar 's father that the forward has been struggling at the @entity9 because he is exhausted			1
@entity0 has covered less distance on the pitch than any outfield player who has played six games at this @entity9 , apart from @entity31 striker @entity30			2
and @entity0 's father @entity32 told @entity34 newspaper @entity33 : ' @entity35 said it looked like his legs weighed 100 kilos ( against @entity38 )			2
' earlier in the tournament , @entity40 's @entity39 suggested that @entity0 's lack of running could be in order to protect his suspect hamstring , which caused him to miss a lot of the season with @entity48			0
inaction man : @entity0 is exhausted , says his father and he has not run a great deal as the table below shows least distance covered in @entity9 ( of players who have featured in six games ) : @entity30 - 47.2km @entity0 - 51.9km @entity56 - 53.9km but @entity39 also believes @entity0 is changing his game and becoming more of an old - fashioned playmaker , writing after the last - 16 match against @entity60 : ' he does n’t seem to be running as much , he is waiting for the ball			1
' his running stats were the lowest on the pitch against @entity60 , which is evidence of the change in his game - but he caused maximum trouble and won the match for @entity6			0
' the more i study his performances , the more i believe he ’s in control and waiting for that moment to arrive when he can make a difference			0
