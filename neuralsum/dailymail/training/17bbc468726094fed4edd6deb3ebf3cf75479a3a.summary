@entity0 , pictured at the @entity1 , has been ordered to hand over £ 1million to her ex-husband @entity2 so he can buy a house the daughter of one of @entity7 ’s richest men warned that a gold - digger ’s charter had been created yesterday after she lost a bitter @entity1 divorce battle			1
@entity0 said there was now a strong disincentive for wealthy women to marry after being ordered to pay more than £ 1million to estranged husband @entity2			1
mr @entity2 , who signed a pre-nuptial agreement , had demanded a £ 2.2million share of the value of their £ 6.6million marital home in @entity19			1
miss @entity0 ’s father @entity20 , who was the director of the media company that created children ’s programme @entity24 , had previously threatened to cut off his daughter financially if mr @entity2 received one penny – he has been paying her a £ 100,000 - a - year allowance and her three children ’s private school fees			1
after the judgment , miss @entity0 , 37 , confirmed that her 71 - year - old father , who has a £ 135million fortune , would stick to his vow and she will have to sell her house and raise her children on her own			1
she said ‘ important public policy considerations ’ arose from the case , adding : ‘ unless @entity39 enacts the recent @entity41 ’s proposals on nuptial agreements , the law will remain in a state of uncertainty			2
this results in very costly and public hearings as well as enormous emotional distress and financial uncertainty			2
my recent experience is exactly what nuptial agreements are designed to eliminate			2
‘ sadly , i ’m left to conclude there is a strong financial disincentive for a wealthy woman to marry if she can not be assured of protecting her family ’s assets			0
simply put , this is a gold - digger ’s charter			0
’ in his judgment , mr @entity60 said mr @entity2 , 45 , must receive £ 1.24million , including £ 900,000 to buy a new home			1
however , miss @entity0 will own around half of the value of the home he buys until their youngest child , now two , is 22			1
miss @entity0 was given her @entity69 home , where @entity70 is a neighbour , by her father in 2008			1
as this is her only asset , it was the only one the judge could consider			2
mr @entity2 admitted he signed a pre-nuptial agreement and two supplementary contracts promising never to seek his wife ’s money			1
ms @entity0 's father @entity20 ( pictured ) was also present to hear the judgement			1
mr @entity2 claims the man has ' acted in spite ' throughout proceedings , threatening to cut off his daughter so he does n't get a pay out but after the marriage broke down in november 2012 , he was left penniless and homeless , ‘ living like a tramp out of bin bags , ’ he said			1
he is now earning the minimum wage at his mother ’s bed and breakfast in @entity91			0
he claimed his father - in - law was motivated by spite and malice in vowing to cut off his daughter : ‘ he has a determination to control almost every aspect of her life			2
’ mr @entity100 said after the judgment : ‘ a law which rewards a gold digger after signing three legal agreements merits real criticism			2
’ mr @entity100 was ranked 17th in the @entity106			1
his production company created @entity24 ( pictured ) a statement for mr @entity2 said he had ‘ never sought a share of his wife ’s wealth ’ but instead sought ‘ sufficient funds to meet his real financial needs having made financial contributions himself during the marriage from employment and his own inheritance ’			1
it added : ‘ marriage brings with it important legal and moral obligations to care for the other spouse in a time of need , including if a marriage breaks down			0
whilst those obligations can be properly regulated and defined by a pre-nuptial agreement , it can not be right for it to remove entirely the obligation to provide for real need			0
’ miss @entity0 married mr @entity2 – ex-husband of underwear model and actress @entity135 and a former boyfriend of @entity137 – in @entity138 in july 2005			1
they met while he was working as a film editor at @entity141 , the firm her father founded			2
the court heard they enjoyed a lavish lifestyle involving recreational cocaine use , extravagant holidays , live - in nannies and visits to mr @entity100 ’s @entity150 mansion before they split following bitter rows			1
miss @entity0 said mr @entity2 had a ‘ reluctance to work ’ and had frittered money on designer clothes , art and strip clubs			1
she accused him of making ‘ cruel and wholly unjustified criticisms against my family ’			0
she added : ‘ @entity2 contributed nothing to my marriage in terms of capital			2
my father ’s stated position that it would be outrageous if the court ordered @entity2 anything is entirely understandable			1
’ mr @entity60 had urged the warring parties to find a way to reach an agreement , saying : ‘ between them they have spent £ 600,000 on this case			2
it is a great tragedy it has come this far			0
‘ many hurtful things have been said			0
caught in the cross fire are three adored , innocent but vulnerable children			0
’ he said that as @entity100 ‘ has never had a penny that has not come from her parents ’ , the only asset he could consider is the house gifted to her			2
he said that one of the reasons for his decision to award mr @entity2 a settlement in the ‘ exceptionally bitter ’ and ‘ very painful ’ case was the children as ‘ their overall welfare is better safeguarded and promoted by making some award to their father ’			1
