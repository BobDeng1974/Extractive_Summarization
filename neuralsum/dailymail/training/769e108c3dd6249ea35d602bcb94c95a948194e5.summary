by @entity0 a 30 - year - old cancer sufferer will finally marry her boyfriend of nearly 10 years this weekend after waiting until now because marriage would have affected her health insurance			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , will wed 49 - year - old @entity8 on sunday with the help of a charity , @entity11			1
although the couple have long been engaged , she did not want to walk down the aisle because marriage would cause her to lose her insurance benefits and see the costs of a plan soar			1
but in february , she entered hospice care meaning that 100 per cent of her end of life care will be covered by her insurance company - which also means that the couple can finally marry			1
final wish : @entity5 , 30 , who has cancer of the esophagus , will marry @entity8 , 49 , on sunday ' when there 's something you 've always wanted and you 're faced with death ... it kind of brings peace to you , ' she told @entity33			1
' there 's something about changing your last name to the person you love			0
it 's just important to me that i get to do that			0
' the non-profit organization , as well and family and friends , have swooped in to plan the wedding in just three weeks , helping @entity5 select her dress and a brown curly wig for the occasion			1
' it 's kind of surreal , emotional , ' she said			0
' it 's going to be better than i thought it would be			0
being able to afford a wedding on its own would be hard to do at this time for us			1
it would n't have been done			0
' the couple met through work just before @entity5 turned 21 , quickly became friends and soon started dating			1
but when she was 25 , her family noticed she was losing weight			2
she went to the doctor and discovered she had a tumor in her esophagus			2
they later found the cancer had spread to her stomach and ovaries , causing her to undergo a hysterectomy			1
in february 2010 , she was given less than a year to live			2
fighter : @entity5 was diagnosed with cancer when she was 25 and has been in remission multiple times but in february she was given just two to six months to live			1
two months ago , she entered hospice care ' i fought and fought and fought for the time that i had , ' @entity5 said			1
' somehow , my body started to get better			0
' but the cancer returned , this time attacking her liver			1
again she battled it , but by november 2013 , it had returned to her esophagus and new cancer was also found in her stomach , her intestines , her liver , gall bladder and her pancreas			1
in total , she battled through seven rounds of chemotherapy and three rounds of radiation but in february , she was given just two to six months to live			1
she now weighs just 88 pounds but hopes she 'll be able to walk down the aisle without using her wheelchair - and she ca n't wait to see what her husband - to - be thinks of her look			2
' i 'm really excited to get his reaction , ' she said			0
' i look healthy with everything together , the makeup people and the hair people			0
i have a nice wig and the dress			0
you get to feel good			0
' @entity8 told @entity33 he is excited to celebrate with his new bride on sunday			1
' she is a happy , happy person , ' he said			0
' she is completely genuine			0
she has never , ever been who she 's not			0
' fight : since she was 25 , @entity5 has suffered cancer of the esophagus , liver , stomach , ovaries , gall bladder and pancreas			1
she has undergone seven rounds of chemotherapy - but still remains smiling early days : the couple is pictured in their first photo together in 2005			0
@entity5 is now just 88 pounds she added : ' he just treats me well and ( he 's ) able to be the rock i need when things fall apart for me , hold me together when i 'm falling apart			2
he stood by me even when i told him he did n't have to			0
' we do n't spend a lot of time thinking about cancer			2
we spend more time talking about politics and silly stuff and he makes funny cartoon ( voices )			0
we just have a good time and he keeps me laughing			0
' the couple 's wedding will be the third hosted by @entity11 in @entity7 since 2011			1
it provides weddings and vow renewals to couples facing terminal illness and serious life - changing circumstances			2
@entity5 said she wishes she could join the team to help people the same way she 's been helped through the process			2

@entity5 will marry her long - time @entity8 , 49 , on sunday with the help of a non-profit , @entity11
she had *put* off the wedding for years because marriage would cause her to lose her insurance benefits
but she had entered hospice care and her end of life care is free , so her plan will no longer be affected by her *marital* status
since she was 25 she has fought cancer of the esophagus , liver , stomach , ovaries and pancreas and has been in remission multiple times
in february , doctors gave her less than six months to live
