by @entity0 last updated at 9:02 pm on 7th october 2011 a planeload of @entity3 holidaymakers have made aviation history by flying to @entity5 on a plane fuelled by used chip pan oil			1
the @entity9 flight from @entity11 airport was the first @entity3 commercial biofuels flight ever from a @entity3 airport			1
one of the engines on the twin - engined @entity16 flight was operated on a 50 per cent blend of ' @entity19 and @entity20 ' , produced from used cooking oil , and 50 per cent @entity23 fuel			0
not red faced : protesters from @entity25 stupid at @entity11 airport protesting against the @entity3 's first commercial flight using biofuel because of the damage it does to the rainforest @entity32 up : @entity3 's first commercial flight powered by sustainable biofuel takes off from @entity11 airport but environmental protesters stripped naked and covered themselves in red body paint in a bid to disrupt the launch			1
calling themselves @entity40 they said that rainforests were being wrecked to make way for biofuel plantations			1
the cooking oil used for the @entity9 flights is collected from the kitchens of hotels and restaurants and then goes through a special processing treatment			0
@entity50 , director of customer service at @entity9 , admitted that the biofuel cost around five to six times the price of aviation fuel , but said the airline was prepared to ' put its money where our mouth is ' because it believed in sustainable biofuels			2
you 're not under a vest : a @entity40 protester is led away by police after the scenes at @entity11 airport mr @entity50 said : ' we are proud to be leading the way with the first commercial biofuel flights and we hope it will make people sit up and take notice			1
' mr @entity50 said the move was designed to make a statement which it was hoped would lead to industry and governments investing in developing fuels which would reduce carbon emissions			0
after today 's light , carrying 232 passengers , there will be a six - week gap before @entity9 starts a full programme of biofuel flights in 2012 from @entity11			1
@entity84 , managing director of @entity85 , which supplies the biofuel , said it made sense to utilise used cooking oil because it was a waste product which could n't be used for anything else			2
it was not economically viable at present to supply the whole of the aviation industry with the fuel and that was why government support was needed			0
long - term other technology was necessary and in three to four years a totally new fuel could come along			0
@entity99 , from @entity11 @entity100 , however , said : ' we can not ignore the massive environmental and social problems caused by trying to feed our addiction to fossil fuels with plant - based alternatives			1
' grub 's up : the biofuel is made by collecting fat from the kitchens of hotels and restaurants before being refined in a special processing treatment plane stupid protester @entity115 said : ' @entity9 seem to be acknowledging that we ca n't continue business as usual in the face of the current climate emergency			2
' it 's a shame their solution is to make matters worse			0
' vast tracts of rainforest , eco systems vital to halting climate change , are currently being trashed to make way for biofuel plantations			0
' land that grows food is being stolen from some of the world 's poorest people so that it can start feeding planes			0

plane flew from @entity11 airport to @entity5
' biofuel production *killing* rainforests , ' say protesters
