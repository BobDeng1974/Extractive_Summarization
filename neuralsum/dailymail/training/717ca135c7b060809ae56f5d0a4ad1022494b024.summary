@entity1 , 72 , says he was forced out following an investigation into his behaviour during filming			1
at the time , the @entity6 put his dismissal down to his health problems			1
@entity1 had previously been diagnosed with clinical depression , a diagnosis that has since been amended to bipolar disorder , in which depressive episodes alternate with periods of manic activity			1
he suspects that his mood swings upset colleagues and members of the public during filming on location at @entity29 in @entity30			1
but he says he ca n’t understand the decision to fire him just before christmas 2008 , and that it plunged him into a despair which culminated in admission to @entity36 ’s @entity35 psychiatric hospital in march 2009			2
‘ they just said : “ we wo n’t be asking you to do it again , ” ’ he told @entity37			2
‘ and actually you ’re so taken aback at that moment you do n’t insist : “ why not ? ” ’ that put me in hospital for a year , basically			2
’ the naturalist , who had worked on the programme since it was launched in 2005 , later tried to find out why he had been treated in this way , but says the @entity6 only gave him ‘ a waffly statement ’ with no specific detail			1
he was replaced by presenter @entity51			2
he said the incident affected his whole family			2
his youngest daughter , @entity54 , described seeing her father taken to hospital : ‘ it was n’t my dad			0
it was a shell of a human			0
my dad is full of life and love , but that person was crippled with self - doubt			0
’ @entity1 spent much of that year in hospital , only being released in december			1
he has described the period as ‘ probably the worst 12 months of my life ’			0
after his diagnosis , he was prescribed lithium , which he still takes			0
he now feels ‘ absolutely fine ’			0
shock : @entity1 's youngest daughter , @entity54 ( left ) , said her father ' was a shell of a human ' when taken to hospital he added : ‘ when i look back , i think during that autumn period i was on a high because i was very edgy and tetchy			1
your ability to work long hours and think quickly and that sort of thing is usually heightened			0
‘ but one or two people said to me , “ you know , you really intimidate people in the office , ” and i said : “ why ? ” they ’d say : “ well you know , you ’re sort of brusque and impatient sometimes			0
” ' i never thought so , you know			0
i look back and i think , yeah , i guess i was			0
’ ‘ i could well see that there was an autumn of mania going on and therefore i was probably giving signals out which i did n’t realise and , i imagine , signals were reported back			0
‘ i think somebody said the public complained i was swearing at a cameraman or a producer when we were on location somewhere in a shop			2
’ he is now returning to the @entity6 in a new six - part series , @entity101 ’s @entity100 , which will feature wildlife experts choosing a creature they want to protect for future generations .			1
