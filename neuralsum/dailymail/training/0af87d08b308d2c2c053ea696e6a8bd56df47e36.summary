' it 's clear when professionals are seeing people who are survivors or at risk of @entity55 , it 's not being referred to the police , what we need to do is get out people in the public sector to fulfill their safeguarding responsibilities , ' he added			1
mr @entity37 went on to say : ' it is child abuse			0
