the decision to choose sir @entity1 to feature on the new £ 5 note has sparked a furious backlash from feminist campaigners			1
the wartime prime minister will replace the image of prison reformer @entity7 on the new - look note will which start circulation in 2016			1
but the move has led to an online petition and a group of 46 mps and peers yesterday asking for the decision to be reviewed			2
icons : author @entity17 or suffragette @entity18 could be candidates for the £ 5 note one group of campaigners is currently trying to raise funds for a legal challenge under the @entity26			1
they would prefer to see author @entity28 or @entity30 nurse @entity29 , who was born in @entity31 , on the note			2
only two women have appeared on modern banknotes since their inception in 1970 - @entity7 , who first appeared on notes in 2002 , and nurse @entity37 , who was on the £ 10 note from 1975 to 1994			1
as anger about the choice escalated , the @entity38 admitted it did choose a woman as a ' contingency ' option			1
but the @entity38 refused to reveal who the woman was , saying it might ' prejudice ' the selection process for people to appear on the next round of banknotes			1
although the @entity38 maintains its silence over the identity of the woman it chose as a ' contingency ' , it is expected she hails from a list of 83 influential women chosen by the public , the @entity50 reported			1
the list includes @entity17 , @entity61 and @entity18			2
anyone appearing on a banknote must meet strict criteria , including being ' uncontroversial ' , easily recognisable and having made an enduring contribution to society			2
there must also be photographs or paintings of them of a high enough quality to be featured on the notes			2
honour : @entity73 sir @entity1 is to appear on the new £ 5 note from 2016 , the @entity38 has announced sir @entity75 expressed surprise at the uproar surrounding the decision to replace @entity7 with @entity1 , who he described as a ' truly great @entity82 leader , orator and writer ' and as ' entirely appropriate ' for the note			1
he said : ' ( the decision was made ) on the basis of choosing the right person and not on the basis of an artificial distinction by gender			2
' he pointed out that a woman - the @entity91 - is on every note			1
campaigner @entity93 told the newspaper the remark was a ' spectacularly asinine point to make '			0
hero : sir @entity1 is regarded by many as the man who saved @entity82 from the clutches of @entity103 's @entity102 she added : ' whatever we think about the @entity91 's hard work , she 's there on the basis of birthright , not on the basis of her achievements			1
' when sir @entity75 announced the news that @entity1 would become the first politician of the modern era to feature on a banknote , he said he hoped the note would become known as ' a @entity1 '			1
his sentiments were echoed by the politician 's grandson , mid-sussex @entity121 mp @entity119 , who was at the ceremony along with other members of @entity1 's family			1
asked whether he thought the nickname would catch on , mr @entity119 said : ' of course it will			0
' we are all going to go to @entity129 and be buying our groceries with @entity131 , and that of course would have given him more pleasure than anything			0
' the design will feature a renowned portrait of the prime minister in defiant pose , taken by photographer @entity140 in december 1941			0
behind him is a view of the houses of @entity144 , with the hands on @entity146 showing three o'clock			0
governor sir @entity147 made the announcement during an event at @entity150 , @entity1 's former home in @entity151 , attended by members of his family			1
it reflects the approximate time of a statement to the @entity157 on may 13 1940 when he famously told @entity158 : ' i have nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears and sweat			0
' the quote itself is also shown on the design			0
a background image shows the @entity169 for literature , with citation , awarded in 1953 to @entity1 - who apart from being a politician was a prolific historical writer			1
sir @entity75 said : ' our banknotes acknowledge the life and work of great @entity82			1
sir @entity1 was a truly great @entity82 leader , orator and writer			1
above that , he remains a hero of the entire free world			0
' his energy , courage , eloquence , wit and public service are an inspiration to us all			0
i am proud to announce that he will appear on our next banknote			0
' @entity1 's image replaces that of @entity7 , the philanthropist and penal reformer , who appears on current notes first issued in 2002			1
these will be phased out over two or three years , leaving no notes featuring the face of a famous woman - other than the @entity91			2
honour : in front of a portrait of the great man at his @entity150 home in @entity151 , @entity147 , the governor of the @entity38 hands the design to @entity208 , the only surviving child of sir @entity1 the choice of @entity1 reflects the fact that , though a political figure , he is widely revered across the spectrum as the man who saved @entity82 in its darkest hour from the fearful advance of @entity218 across @entity219			1
another war hero , the @entity221 , is the only other prime minister to have featured on a banknote image - the old £ 5 phased out in the 1990s			1
@entity1 had a long parliamentary career during which he served as home secretary and chancellor before a spell in the political wilderness in the 1930s when he warned of the increasing threat of @entity231 rearmament			1
in may 1940 , he replaced @entity232 as prime minister in the newly - formed @entity234			0
his leadership and brilliant oratory were credited with helping to steer @entity82 to victory			0
after war broke out sir @entity1 became prime minister , replacing @entity232 and leading the newly - formed @entity234			1
as the country faced ' an ordeal of the most grievous kind ' , the ' @entity243 ' , as the @entity244 called him , stood up in the @entity245 on may 13 1940 and gave one of his most famous speeches , declaring : ' i have nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears and sweat '			0
these were the same words he had used when he met his cabinet for the first time earlier that day			0
he concluded with : ' come then , let us go forward together with our united strength			0
' both are examples of the brilliance of his oratory			0
@entity1 became a patriotic icon , exemplar of leadership and a national inspiration during the @entity267			2
defeated in the post-victory 1945 general election , he argued strongly for @entity271 unity against the threat of @entity273			0
he was returned to office in 1951 and finally retired in 1955 , aged 80			0
aged 90 , he died on the morning of sunday january 24 , 1965			0
defeated by @entity275 in the 1945 general election , he served again as prime minister from 1951 to 1955 , when he retired aged 80			0
@entity1 died in 1965 and was given a full state funeral , the first commoner to receive such an honour since @entity281 in 1898			2
he was also the first to feature on a @entity82 coin - the 1965 crown or five - shilling piece			0
speaking in the grounds of @entity150 , sir @entity1 's grandson , mr @entity119 , said featuring on a bank note would have given the former wartime prime minister great pleasure			1
he said : ' he was an extraordinary man and his ability to capture the mood and the people 's mood was one of his great gifts as a statesman			0
' the design of the bank note , the quotation and the whole idea behind it is so appropriate and fitting , and my grandfather would have been truly very proud			2
' asked why it had taken so long for sir @entity1 to feature on a bank note , mr @entity147 said he is the most recent figure to appear on any note			1
he said : ' normally we allow a much longer period of time to elapse before we are willing to make a judgment			0
' i think @entity1 is a very obvious figure and i was very proud , as one of my last acts as governor , to put him on a bank note			1
' we do n't put many figures on			0
' the first historical figure to appear on a bank note was only in 1970			2
' we have only had 15 since so there are not many opportunities to make this decision and @entity1 is only the second figure from the @entity325			2

@entity38 admits it has chosen a woman as a ' contingency '
sir @entity1 will replace @entity7 on £ 5 note from 2016
but feminists are campaigning for a woman to appear on banknotes
sir @entity147 dismissed row , saying @entity1 ' entirely appropriate '
