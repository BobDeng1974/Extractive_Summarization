@entity0 demonstrated to the magistrates the sign he had made behind his back and told them : ' i was interacting with the fans			1

i was having a bit of banter back			0
' controversial : @entity0 claims he was just ' bantering ' with the @entity11 crowd prosecutor @entity56 told the court that the player had mimicked pulling his shorts down , put his left arm behind his bottom and made a homophobic gesture towards the @entity11 crowd			1
at one point he was seen by a witness backing into @entity11 player @entity67 and simulating a sex act which was deemed to be homophobic , the court was told			1
mr @entity56 said the @entity11 fans were chanting ' you fat b * * * * * d ' and ' you 're fat and you know you are ' at him			1
unacceptable : @entity11 have reported a long list of incidents of homophobic abuse to the @entity77 he said : ' it seems that the player reacted to this and he mimicked pulling down his shorts and with his left hand behind his back mimicked that he had something in his hand and moved it back and forward			2

short spell : @entity0 played for @entity1 between august 2012 and april 2013 both men told the court they found it offensive and perceived it to be homophobic			1

' season ticket holder @entity109 , who sits in the lower west stand , said he noticed @entity0 make the obscene gesture four or five times during the match			2

return : the forward spent two years at at @entity120 and has now returned to @entity121 to play for @entity122 he said he was disappointed that neither the linesman nor the referee reacted to what was going on and said : ' it was utterly disgusting			0

@entity147 arguably enjoyed the best spell of his carrer at @entity150 between 2006 and 2007 mr @entity42 said that hand gestures were made during football matches all the time and that due to @entity11 having a large gay community an innocent hand gesture made behind his back had been perceived as being homophobic			1

the court also heard from three character witnesses who described @entity0 as polite , approachable and respectful .			2

@entity0 claimed hand gesture was ' banter ' with @entity11 fans
but witnesses told the court it was ' disgusting ' and ' homophobic '
