@entity1 's fall from grace has been the source of great merriment for rival fans and the launch of the new @entity6 has inspired another dig. with @entity10 's side languishing in the bottom half of the @entity12 , one wag thought it would be a humorous way of showing off @entity16 's latest gadget			1
@entity17 can fit the top 14 @entity12 clubs in humorous mock - up @entity1 hope £ 60m @entity20 can revive their fortunes @entity1 fans would have had difficulty spotting their team when viewing the @entity12 table on an @entity26 or @entity6 6			1

@entity6 6 can be linked to an @entity16 watch for calls and apps @entity17 is significantly bigger than any phone @entity16 has launched @entity10 is still searching for his first league win as @entity1 boss the @entity17 is significantly bigger than any phone @entity16 has launched before , though obviously much smaller than an ipad mini			2
the dimensions are : 6.22 inches ( 15.8cm ) in length , 3.06 inches ( 7.78 cm ) wide , though it is very thin at 0.28 inch ( 0.7 cm )			0
