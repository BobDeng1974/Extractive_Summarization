the man , who police named as @entity12 alias @entity10 , is understood to be of @entity2 origin and was arrested near the @entity15 area of the capital city @entity17			1
he is also suspected of having attempted to recruit militants in the northern city of @entity20 - where he is understood to have relatives - having reportedly first arrived in the country about six months ago to scout for potential extremists			1
he is believed to have arrived in @entity2 in february and used social media websites including @entity34 to sound out local men about their interest in joining @entity37 , according @entity39 - joint commissioner of @entity30 - who was speaking at a press briefing today			1
he targetted @entity42 from @entity43 as well as @entity2 , mr @entity39 added , before saying : ' he also went to @entity44 and @entity45 but we are yet to know the reason behind his trips '			1
' from his passport we came to know that he went to @entity6 in september last year and took part in the demonstration against @entity53 , ' the @entity30 spokesperson went on to say			2
investigators : @entity30 believe @entity12 arrived in @entity2 in february and used social media websites including @entity34 to sound out local men about their interest in joining @entity37 the news comes just days after a 22 - year - old university student - who also had links to the northern city of @entity20 - was arrested in @entity17 on suspicion of recruiting would - be fighters for @entity37			1
@entity60 , who was studying at @entity20 's @entity61 , was arrested in the capital 's @entity63 area of @entity17 on thursday after being reported for recruiting militants			1
just one day before @entity60 's arrest , local police detained @entity68 , 26 , and @entity69 , 24 , who were allegedly travelling to join @entity37 militants in @entity6 , assisted by an unnamed @entity71			1
it is understood the suspected would - be jihadists were planning to travel to a @entity75 airport popular with tourists , before travelling by road to the @entity6 border and then slipping across into the warzone			1
porous border : it is understood the suspected would - be jihadists were planning to travel to a @entity75 airport popular with tourists , before travelling to the @entity6 border ( pictured ) and then slipping into the warzone @entity12 's arrest came just two days after @entity2 detectives revealed they were searching for a @entity88 - based @entity37 agent who had recruited several young men arrested in recent weeks , according to the @entity90			1
three alleged recruits were arrested last week , including the son of a retired judge and the other the son of a senior civil servant			0
they had been told they would travel to @entity6 via @entity75 posing as followers of @entity98 - an @entity100 religious study group not affiliated with any terror collective			2
officers first learned that a 24 - year - old @entity1 man from @entity88 had been enlisting @entity37 fighters when they arrested seven young @entity100 extremists , the newspaper added			1
among those arrested were an associate of @entity109 - the 21 - year - old student behind the failed 2012 attack on @entity112 's @entity111			0
approaching : reports that @entity37 militants are now just one mile from @entity114 came from the @entity115 - an organisation supporting the work of @entity117 fear : @entity117 , is the vicar of @entity114 's @entity119 - the only @entity121 church in @entity7			1
earlier @entity122 had claimed the terrorist group were six miles from the city @entity126 jets flew armed sorties for a second day over @entity7 yesterday – but again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons			0
defence chiefs insisted that the flights by @entity133 fighter - bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the @entity136 jihadists who have swept across large swathes of @entity7 and @entity6 , carrying out massacres			2
but the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that @entity1 is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against @entity5			0
it came as military commanders warned that @entity1 should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in @entity7 to crush @entity147 , which is also known as @entity37 and @entity37			2
former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the @entity1 could target the terrorists in @entity6			2
while the @entity153 confirmed that the @entity126 's third mission had – like on saturday – failed to locate any targets , @entity152 - led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under is control in @entity6 , as well as a command centre			0
the mobile refineries generate up to £ 1.2million a day for the militants			0
the news comes amid reports of fierce fighting in the @entity114 suburbs where @entity37 militants are trying to seize control of the @entity7 capital - despite ongoing @entity169 airstrikes against them			2
the fighting is taking place just one mile to the west of the city , with government forces desperately trying to hold off the militants , who allegedly killed up to 1,000 soldiers during clashes yesterday			0
isis have held a number of towns and villages close to the @entity7 capital since earlier in the year , when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country - enabling the terrorist group to seize further swaths of territory for their so - called caliphate			0
reports that @entity37 militants are now just one mile from @entity114 came from the @entity115 - an organisation supporting the work of @entity117 , vicar of the city 's @entity119 , the only @entity121 church in @entity7			2
in a message posted on @entity34 , the group said : ' the @entity5 are now less than 2km away from entering @entity114			0
they said it could never happen and now it almost has			0
' @entity195 says he overestimated what the @entity196 could do			0
well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little , ' they added			0
the claims were backed up by @entity122 himself , who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from @entity114 .			0

local police named arrested @entity71 as @entity12 , alias @entity10
