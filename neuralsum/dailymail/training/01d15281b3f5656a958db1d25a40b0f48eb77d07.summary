' when the @entity58 started up over here i got involved in that			0
' a lot of us here took it to the extreme , where we was actually going out and mob up and attack them			0
that 's because all we had			2
we did n't have the steadfast charity years ago			2
' the group are then shown making @entity18 salutes , as well as chanting ' white power ' and ' victory to the aryan race '			1

it ’s not gon na happen in the next few years			0
maybe it ’ll happen in the future , but not now			0
' a spokesman for the @entity9 , which has now had its charity status removed , said : ' @entity61 has been suspended pending an internal investigation			1

' we can not be held responsible for the views , actions or political affiliations of our supporters			2
' ' @entity25 is not and has never been political in its aims and we are perplexed by the suggestion it has become the focal point of the far right			0
' a spokesman for the @entity142 said : ' @entity9 is not a charity and has been removed from the @entity144			1
we made this decision because there are rules in law about who can benefit from a charity			2
' in this case it was not clear that the @entity9 's beneficiaries , described as ' members of the @entity156 community living in @entity13 ' , could be identified or are a sufficient section of the public , as required in charity law			1
' as the @entity9 's purposes are not charitable for the public benefit , the @entity9 is not a charity			1

' a spokesman from @entity45 @entity44 said : ' the depiction of us as anti any other religion is wrong and counterproductive to the positive work @entity45 has done in building interfaith relations			1
' we promote @entity45 values which are about cohesiveness , duty to society and universal peace			1
' our actions over the years show that @entity45 promotes diversity and unity in @entity44			1
' our training camp is attended by a cross section of society and we try to give our volunteers an opportunity to discuss their opinions and understand all views			2
' there are some strong views on interfaith issues but these are personal views			0
' we do not deny these views exist nor do we seek to censor or ignore them and we strongly oppose any suggestion that by not censoring them we promote or agree with them			0
' we are investigating these alleged comments to ensure those who made them are better informed , trained or prevented from making statements which may be interpreted as anti another community			0

' he incited bombings basically			0
@entity255 , he was a brilliant guy though			0
' the documentary also shows preacher @entity272 speaking at an event in which he makes a series of anti-semitic comments , telling those gathered : ' @entity279 , @entity278 countries , whatever you call it , these countries are controlled by @entity283			0
' if you look at the biggest bankers in the world , that fund these countries , they are @entity283 , and @entity283 run @entity289			2
so we can safely say that at any time there was an @entity279 , or @entity13 or whatever , invasion of the @entity295 lands , it is all a problem coming back to the @entity297			0

a spokesman said they were ' already aware that there were concerns of a similar nature ' regarding ' allegations of links to extremism ' against @entity36			0
he said the new evidence will be added to its current case , noting : ' the claim is that they had invited external speakers to events without doing proper checks on the individuals or as to what they would be saying at the event			0
' certainly the film evidence is of someone who has been invited to an event and it is clear that a young lad has no steer about what he should be checking or asking of that person			0
' mr @entity241 , who is also a television presenter for the @entity344 and a barrister , told @entity347 magazine that he had left the charity ' in connection with the documentary '			2
