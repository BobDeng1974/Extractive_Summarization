@entity0 is investigating a photograph blasted out on @entity2 which seems to show someone holding up a smartphone , displaying a picture of the @entity7 flag , in front of the @entity9			1
the photo appears to have been taken at night on the pedestrian mall occupying what used to be part of @entity14			0
the @entity9 's north portico can be seen in the background			2
it was first tweeted on august 9 by an account that was later deleted			1
' [ @entity20 ] e are here # @entity21 near our # target : ) sooooooooooooon , ' read the message that accompanied it			1
' we are in your state , ' it read			0
'' we are in your cities			0
we are in your streets			0
you are our goals anywhere [ sic ]			1
' @entity0 spokesman @entity50 told @entity51 that his agency has ' an intelligence division whose mission is to assess information that we receive every day for dangerousness or potential threat level			2
' ' we are aware of the image and will take the necessary and appropriate follow up steps , ' he said			2
the taunting message follows a separate photo first seen online on june 30 , which appeared to show a hand - written note , in @entity66 , dated june 20 and held up in front of the @entity68 in @entity69			1
' soldiers of the @entity7 will pass from here soon , ' the note reads , according to an @entity51 translation			1
a verse from the @entity74 follows , reading , ' ... and @entity75 is perfecting his light even though the disbelievers hate [ that ]			2
' on june 20 another @entity7 supporter captured this image in front of the @entity80 in @entity69 -- tweeting it more than a week later along with a threat that ' soldiers of the @entity7 will pass from here soon ' ' near our target ' : the @entity9 photo was first tweeted by an account that was subsequently shut down @entity7 , the terror group that claims it has established an @entity7 caliphate in parts of @entity34 and @entity89 , has used social media as a propaganda tool , and ramped up those efforts after president @entity93 announced on august 8 that he would approve airstrikes against the group in northern @entity89 if they were necessary			1
a half - day later , the @entity21 struck in what the @entity9 said was an effort to guarantee the safety of @entity21 personnel in @entity89 @entity100 , and to protect tens of thousands of @entity101 , a religious minority group			1
an @entity21 operations outpost in the @entity100 capital of @entity106 , @entity9 officials said then , was close enough to @entity7 forces to justify limited military intervention			1
the @entity109 had escaped to a mountainside and were languishing without food or water			0
@entity93 took a victory lap on thursday after @entity115 flyovers established that days of @entity21 airdrops of supplies had been sufficient to sustain them long enough to escape			0
pushback : @entity21 are giving as good as they get , with tweeted replies aimed at intimidating the @entity122 group ' we are in your cities , ' the @entity7 tweeter claimed , but this man , apparently a @entity21 military veteran , had the perfect retort @entity7 fighters have boasted a fearlessness common in a culture that regards martyrdom as a kind of success and sees @entity21 as an enemy almost as fundamental as @entity136			1
in one interview filmed in @entity34 by the cameras of @entity140 , an unnamed @entity7 soldier warns : ' i say to @entity21 that the @entity142 has been established			2
and we will not stop			0
' ' do n't be cowards and attack us with drones , ' he says			0
' instead send your soldiers , the ones we humiliated in @entity89			0
' ' we will humiliate them everywhere , @entity149 willing , and we will raise the flag of @entity75 in the @entity9			0

followed a separate @entity7 warning photographed june 20 in front of the @entity68 in @entity69 with the warning : ' soldiers of the @entity7 will pass from here soon '
@entity0 says it ' will take the necessary and appropriate follow up steps '
' we are in your state , ' the latest tweet reads , ' we are in your cities / we are in your streets / you are our goals anywhere [ sic ] '
the @entity9 photo was *originally* tweeted with the message : ' [ @entity20 ] e are here # @entity21 near our # target : ) sooooooooooooon '
