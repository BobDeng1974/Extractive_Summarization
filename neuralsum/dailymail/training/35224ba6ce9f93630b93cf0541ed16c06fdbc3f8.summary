at 5ft 2 " tall and tipping the scales at just under 6st , @entity0 , now 30 , from @entity1 , thought she would never become a mother			1
diagnosed with anorexia in her teens , she endured two stints in therapy before meeting her partner , @entity8 , in 2004			2
much to her surprise , she soon became pregnant but despite her happiness , her anorexia never completely went away , with @entity0 surviving on just two pieces of toast a day during her third and most recent pregnancy			1
happy family : @entity0 , holding her daughter @entity16 , with son @entity17 , partner @entity8 and oldest son @entity18 unwell : @entity0 , pictured while pregnant with @entity16 , was living on just two slices of toast a day now mother to @entity18 , eight , @entity17 , seven and baby @entity16 , @entity0 says she hopes the birth of her youngest child will help her turn the corner and become the mother she 's always wanted to be			1
' i was first diagnosed with anorexia when i was about 16 but had issues long before that , ' explains @entity0 , who appears on tonight 's episode of @entity32			1
' although i was never fat , i used to eat a lot and i do remember a girl at school saying to me if you carry on eating like that , you 're going to get fat			0
' so i cut out chocolate and crisps and lost a little bit of weight and it spiralled from there			0
' at my worst , i was eating one rich tea biscuit a day			2
' although dangerously ill , @entity0 managed to pass her gcses and combined school work with a demanding weekend job , which she says was ' like exercise '			1
at 18 , she was hospitalised and spent time at @entity49 in @entity50 before being transferred to the @entity52 branch			0
doctors , horrified by her inability to fight off the disease , warned her that she risked being unable to have children			2
but even that was n't enough to stop @entity0			1
' it upset me , the thought of it , ' she remembers			0
' i was n't getting periods because i was so underweight but at the time , i was so in the grip of the eating disorder , i did n't care			0
' not well : @entity0 first became ill in her teens and is pictured on the left at 15 and on the right aged 16 at her prom first recovery : @entity0 pictured aged 17 after being discharged from the @entity68 - a clinic for unwell teens as with any illness , anorexia can result in problems during pregnancy			1
' the are a number of potential effects of anorexia , ' explains @entity78 of the @entity79			2
' among them are a low birth weight baby , miscarriage and stillbirth , premature birth and an increased chance of having a caesarean section			0
' the mother is also more likely to develop postnatal depression if she suffers from anorexia			2
' a healthy diet is vital for both the baby and mother throughout pregnancy and after the birth			2
' but @entity0 's life was about to change dramatically - and for the better - when she met and fell in love with her partner @entity8 much to the couple 's delight , within months of striking up a relationship and against all the odds , the 20 - year - old found herself pregnant			1
' we were only together for five months before i fell pregnant , ' says @entity0			1
' we thought there was no point using contraceptives because we thought i would n't be able to have children			2
' and with her maternal instincts kicking in , @entity0 found herself eating properly for the first time in years			1
' i would eat chips for breakfast , ' she chuckles			0
' potatoes were my craving			0
my eating disorder was never about hurting anyone else , just myself , and my maternal instincts took over			0
' but six months after @entity18 was born by emergency caesarian , the anorexia returned			1
by now pregnant with her second child , the stress of juggling the demands of a tiny baby and a pregnancy left @entity0 struggling			1
' from the outside , i looked like a happy mum , ' she reveals			0
' but because of the caesarian , i found it harder to bond with @entity18 and although i did fall in love with him when he was about three months old , the stress of being pregnant again so soon led to it coming back			0
looking up : @entity0 with her partner @entity8 , who she met aged 20			2
she credits him with helping to beat the illness not easy : @entity0 aged 19 in @entity49 just before she met @entity8 she weighed just 5st 8lb at the time ' it was n't all the time but it was there			1
the clothes i was wearing were maternity but a size 10			0
i think i was ok			0
i was small but not too bad			0
' by the end of her pregnancy , @entity0 , who says she spent most of the nine months on a diet of a breakfast of bran flakes with milk and a dinner of @entity152 , weighed just 9st 5lbs			1
although at 7.5lbs baby @entity17 was smaller than her older son , he was healthy and @entity0 was besotted			1
but once again , her anorexia returned - this time triggered by the stress of juggling two small sons with an increasingly busy job			2
' i was working in a solicitors office in @entity50 and i can remember throwing up in the office toilet , ' she remembers			0
' we were dealing with home repossessions which went up from 20 to 100 in a week after the recession began			0
' i felt like i was n't giving 100 per cent at home or work - compounded by feeling awful for leaving the boys and for not being able to do my job as well as i wanted			0
' weighing just 6st 6lbs , @entity0 's problems were made worse by a litany of health problems that included foot surgery and having a lump removed from her breast			1
' i started with two slices of toast , the one flapjack at lunch and i would try and eat evening meal , ' says @entity0			1
' i started throwing that up and then the same with flapjack at work			0
once i was signed off work , i would vomit up to 20 times a day			2
' the children were never around when i did it and i would eat meals with everyone but @entity8 would do most of the parenting			0
' happier : @entity0 is determined to beat anorexia for the sake of all three children and for partner @entity8 high hopes : @entity0 wants to be a wonderful mother to her children and says she will beat anorexia the pressure proved too much for the couple to handle and they split up for two years before getting back together again in 2012			1
but anorexia was still casting its shadow over @entity0 's life and when she became pregnant for a third time , dealing with it became more difficult than ever			1
this time , the trigger was a court case following an assault by a former boyfriend			0
unable to cope with the stress , @entity0 was living on a single slice of toast and peanut butter a day			1
' i did have a lot of support from the midwife , ' says @entity0 , ' but i was under a lot of stress and pressure and i felt bad that i was n't able to eat normally for her			2
' later she found me a dietician and i increased what i was eating to two slices of toast and peanut butter and one apple a day			1
' by the end of her pregnancy , @entity0 weighed just 8st 3lb , much of it baby , and was warned that she faced a riskier than normal birth as a result			1
luckily , daughter @entity16 was born healthy , although at 6lb 12oz , she weighed considerably less than her older brothers had			1
although @entity0 says she is still struggling with her eating and is currently back on her pregnancy routine of two slices of toast and peanut butter a day , she is positive that she 'll find a way to beat the disease			1
' i 'm maintaining my weight , ' she says			0
' i feel positive that i 'm keeping my weight on and i 'm not getting worse			0
if i start the day good and i end the day good , that 's enough			2
' the healthier i am , the more i can do with the children , ' she adds			0
' they are my motivation			0
if i did n't have them , i might not still be here			0
