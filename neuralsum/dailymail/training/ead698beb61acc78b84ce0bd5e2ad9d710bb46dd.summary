a @entity1 - themed troupe of dancers and a second world war tank gate - crashed the start of @entity6 ’s spring conference in @entity7 today			1
performers in hot pants , jackboots and @entity1 insignia goose - stepped to ' @entity12 ' as delegates arrived in the @entity15 seaside town - including @entity18 's @entity17 wife @entity16			1
the scene overshadowed the opening session of the conference , ahead of mr @entity18 's key - note speech this afternoon			1
a seven - strong troupe of female dancers performed a choreographed routine as @entity12 blared from a pa system on the tank turret			1
the cast were in @entity7 to promote the new touring production of the musical comedy about a failed producer who tried to put on the worst show ever			1
the new @entity46 production will features stand - up comics @entity47 , @entity49 and @entity50 – as well as tv celebrity @entity51			2
it comes as mr @entity18 prepared to address the @entity6 conference this afternoon after jetting back from the @entity54 where he spoke at @entity54 's leading conservative conference in @entity56			1
the @entity6 leader flew to @entity56 to address the gathering of hardcore activists before catching a ‘ red eye ’ flight home overnight to get back in time for the @entity6 conference			1
@entity62 , wife of @entity6 leader @entity18 , greets delegates as they arrive for the @entity64 at the @entity65 in @entity7 , @entity15 today former @entity68 @entity67 stars @entity69 and @entity70 attend the @entity6 spring conference today @entity6 mp @entity72 was given a standing ovation by delegates at the party 's spring conference			1
among but mr @entity18 was handed the ' graveyard ' speaking slot at the end of the day and was forced to address an audience of just 250 in a convention centre with a capacity for over 5,000			1
mr @entity18 delivered his speech to row after row of empty chairs just an hour after the hall had been packed for a speech by @entity87 , the darling of @entity90 conservatives			2
but the @entity6 leader was given a major boost today after research was published indicating he is on track to win the nearby seat of @entity95			1
the @entity97 survey , funded by party donor @entity98 , put mr @entity18 on 39 per cent ahead of @entity101 rival @entity100 on 28 per cent when people were prompted with candidate names			1
a previous poll by @entity106 lord @entity105 in november had suggested the @entity106 could retain the seat - where their mp @entity108 is stepping down			2
at the party 's conference today , @entity6 mp @entity72 today warned delegates the party will not grow unless it can shake off the taint of xenophobia and demonstrate it is the ‘ party of the @entity115 ’			1
mr @entity72 , who won a by - election in @entity117 and @entity118 after defecting from the @entity119 , said currently voters knew @entity6 wanted to leave the @entity121 and cut immigration			1
@entity6 delegates were out in force in @entity7 today ahead of @entity18 's speech this afternoon but the party must ‘ talk about other things as well ’ and reassure people it is not a threat to the @entity115 in order to have wider appeal			1
mr @entity72 told activists : ‘ there are two things most people know about us - we want to leave the @entity121 , and we want to cut immigration			0
‘ we should talk about those things			0
but if we want to get beyond 20 per cent - 30 per cent of the vote to the 40 per cent or so we will need to win constituencies , we will have to explain why we want those things , challenge some of the misconceptions there are around our party , and talk about other things as well			2
’ speaking in the @entity54 last night mr @entity18 warned the @entity148 gathering that they risked becoming dinosaurs like the conservatives in the @entity46 if they continued to embrace the political centre			2
mr @entity18 slammed @entity154 over his failure to identify the infamous @entity158 executioner ' @entity156			2
' ' of course they should have told us his name , ' he said			0
' we should have heard it weeks ago			0
this information 's been known for a long time			0
' he also claimed the name was leaked to cover yesterday 's immigration figures			0
' by sheer coincidence , ' he said , @entity167 's name was published ' on the day when the government has to announce the worst immigration figures ever seen in the history of the @entity46			0
' he also hit out against cage , the @entity46 ngo that often advocates on behalf of radicalized @entity175 and brands their detractors ' islamophobes			0
' ' yes , yes , yes ! ' @entity18 exploded when asked if the group was an embarrassment to most @entity46			2
' it 's politcal correctness ! ' i mean , we see protests on a regular basis with these groups on the streets of @entity188 saying and shouting things that – if you and i did them , we 'd find ourselves behind bars in very short order			0
' ' we actually have a @entity195 culture , ' he added			0
' it 's actually in our @entity197 , so let 's stand up for it			0
' the thing about us ' is that we have been , of all the @entity202 countries , the most tolerant of all different religions and all different groups who have come to @entity46			0
' while ' private observance ' of any religion ' is fine , ' he insisted , ' unless we live under one law we 're in trouble			0
' @entity18 flew to @entity56 to address @entity54 's leading conservative conference - but hardly anyone showed up to listen ' we 're not the @entity90 ' : @entity18 , whose @entity6 is challenging both @entity119 and @entity213 , said his is a real political force , not just an influence group trying to reform a wayward party mr @entity18 said the @entity148 was ' going through the same crisis of identity as the @entity106 in @entity46 '			1
@entity6 , he boasted , was ' an insurgent political force that has taken on the political establishment and rocked them to the backs of their heels			2
' but he said : ' we 're not the tea party			0
our job is not to influence one political party			0
we 're not an outlier from the @entity119			0
