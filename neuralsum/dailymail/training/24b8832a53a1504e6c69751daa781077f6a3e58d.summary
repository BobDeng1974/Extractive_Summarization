@entity1 's preparations for the @entity3 season were dealt a blow as @entity5 limped off less than 30 minutes into his first start since returning to the club , as @entity9 's side rounded off their pre-season tour of @entity11 with a hard - fought win against @entity13			1
the former @entity15 international went down clutching his ankle midway through the first half and had to be replaced by @entity18 after 28 minutes			0
@entity1 were already behind at the point , due to the left boot of former @entity22 playmaker @entity21			1
@entity23 equalised for the visitors with an impressive dipping strike early in the second half , before substitute @entity27 netted his second goal for the @entity29 with a stunning individual effort nine minutes from time			1
check back on @entity32 's live minute - by - minute coverage here			1
@entity13 : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity21 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42			2

host commentator thanks for following our live coverage of @entity1 's 2 - 1 win in @entity56 against @entity13			1
we saw a couple of great goals on a decent night for @entity9 's side			1
next up they face @entity61 on tuesday at @entity62 before opening their @entity3 campaign against @entity64			1
@entity1 win their final game of their pre season tour - coming from behind at the break			1
@entity23 and @entity27 grabbed the goals in an excellent second half for the @entity29			1
the only downside was @entity5 's injury and we await further news on that			1
@entity27 and @entity76 link up - the playmaker finds @entity76 and puts him in on goal but the dinked finish goes narrowly wide with the ' keeper floored			1
we enter stoppage time at the end of the game			0
@entity84 plays with his marker down the right and crosses it left footed			0
@entity18 and @entity27 were both flying in for the header and the latter could n't divert it past the ' keeper with the pair completely unmarked			2
another brilliant strike ! @entity27 brings the ball in from the right wing and some brilliant dribbling takes him on a run past three defenders before he slots it past the ' keeper			1
it 's his second goal of pre season and he looks more than ready for his @entity3 return			2
great ball control , tidy finish			0
nine minutes left and @entity1 lead			2
@entity106 instantly goes close with a header			0
@entity108 on for @entity109 - who himself had come on as a replacement at half time			1
@entity106 on for @entity46 @entity112 is back - a trademark drop of the shoulder takes him round the outside of the full back and he slides the ball across the box			0
sadly @entity18 ca n't quite reach it and the chance is wasted			0
20 minutes left at the @entity122			0
@entity1 are well on top and the hosts are struggling to cope with the rise in tempo			2
looks like the @entity29 substitutes have had the required effect			0
the @entity131 winger replaces @entity44 on the field			0
he 'll need to impress here to get into @entity9 's thoughts - or those of another manager considering a move			1
how did that not go in ? ! ? @entity27 delivered the ball into the box and @entity141 flicks it onto the post and then @entity143 could n't quite knock in the rebound with the ' keeper sprawling			1
then the hosts run straight up the other end and they have a two - on - one but they waste the opportunity			0
@entity149 comes on for @entity48 while @entity112 replaces @entity23			2
hazard moves in to the no 10 role			0
@entity18 should have put @entity1 ahead there			2
he latches on to an excellent @entity23 through ball but he ca n't do it justice and his hesitation ruins the chance			2
looks like @entity112 is the next replacement coming on			0
two subs combine : @entity141 is unmarked in the box and directs @entity27 ' corner at goal with a stooping header but it 's well saved by the substitute ' keeper			1
fantastic finish from the @entity169 ! a deflected @entity109 cross comes to @entity1 's @entity171 on the edge of the box and he blasts a dipping finish into the ' keeper 's top corner ! he took the ball down with an exquisite touch before swinging his left boot at it to level the scores at the @entity122 after 51 minutes			1
loads of changes at the break for @entity1			1
@entity76 , @entity27 , @entity109 , @entity141 , @entity143 and @entity185 replace @entity51 , @entity49 , @entity47 , @entity50 , @entity45 and @entity43			1
@entity5 looked the brightest he has so far for @entity1 but @entity9 will be worried about his injury that could reduce him to just two fit strikers			1
the @entity15 hurt his right ankle coming down from an aerial challenge but tried to continue before leaving the field of play			0
@entity49 has looked good , showing pace on the right flank to stretch the defence but he has so far been unable to provide the ammunition to @entity51 since he moved central			2
that 's it for the first half			2
@entity1 not overly impressive and they trail courtesy of @entity21 's 17th minute goal			1
they started brightly but have since faded			0
more concerning though was @entity5 limping off injured with just eight days til the @entity29 kick off their @entity3 campaign			1
@entity49 has been the best player in @entity203 and he 's only supposed to be half - fit - expect a few changes from @entity9 at the break			1
it 's a bit of a @entity208 moment here			0
@entity50 goes down and @entity49 bends in a brilliant free kick from 25 yards out			0
it looks like it goes nestles in the back of the net but on the replays it actually hit the stanchion and ended up behind the goal			0
@entity38 goes down under a challenge from @entity47 in the @entity1 area and claims for a penalty			2
the referee waves away his protest though and replays show it was a good tackle by the @entity1 new boy			2
meanwhile , @entity141 , @entity27 and @entity143 are warming up on the touchline			1
@entity44 drives a shot wide for @entity1 - bit of a rarity there			1
and it has @entity112 doubled up in laughter on the bench as it zips wide of the goal			2
@entity5 hobbles off towards the bench now - boot off and he ca n't continue			2
@entity169 midfielder @entity18 replaces the veteran striker			0
looks like @entity51 will go into the no 9 role now			2
@entity5 's back on but he does n't look comfortable			2
you 'd imagine @entity9 would n't risk him carrying on in a friendly if it 's serious though			2
@entity5 is down injured inside the @entity13 box			0
let 's hope it 's just one of his playacting routines			0
there did n't look to be much contact with the ' keeper but he turned his ankle as he landed from an aerial challenge			0
not great - by all standards			0
it must be difficult for the former @entity256 man out of position on the left wing - but here 's another comical vine as he knocks a ball out for a throw in			0
@entity9 does n't look best impressed ... former @entity22 and @entity263 man @entity21 gives the hosts the lead at the @entity122			1
a simple finish well executed as he tucks home a cross with @entity46 caught ball - watching			0
@entity5 's at the heart of everything here for @entity1 - he finally looks fit after some mixed appearances as a sub previously in pre season			1
this time he gets away from his marker but he does n't hit the shot cleanly from the edge of the box and it 's easily gathered by the ' keeper			0
close ! @entity5 hits a cross after drifting out to the right wing but it 's mishit and flies towards goal			1
luckily @entity33 was there to tip it away			0
the game is opening up a bit now - @entity5 ( deflected ) and @entity49 both have efforts beaten away by @entity33 in the @entity291 goal			1
pretty low key start from both sides so far			0
but @entity13 look to have had the best chance with @entity38 blazing over a decent opportunity eight yards out			0
to partially save his embarrassment the linesman has his flag up			0
the home side get the game underway at the @entity122			0
we 're not far from the 7.45pm kick off now			0
@entity84 is among the @entity1 substitutes - he 's sporting the no 18 shirt			1
how many appearances is he likely to get this season ? @entity9 will be taking this seriously - but probably not as seriously as the @entity307			2
their president is here for the opening of the new stadium , and they 've just had their air force flying overhead			0
with the young @entity315 pretender still out with a minor injury niggle , @entity43 has another chance to show what he can do in goal			1
here he is taking a cross from @entity185 during the warm up			0
the big news from @entity56 is that @entity5 makes his first start since returning to @entity1 - and the big man will lead the line alongside @entity51			1
other summer signings @entity47 and @entity46 both also start while 18 - year - old @entity45 is in @entity9 's line up too			1
it 's already looking busy at the brand new @entity122 .			0

blues are opening the new stadium in @entity56 on last stop of their tour
@entity336 missed out through injury , with @entity43 starting in goal
@entity1 kick off at 7.45pm with eight days to go until opener vs @entity64
@entity5 started up front with @entity51 playing wide
@entity22 and @entity263 old boy @entity21 opened the scoring in first half
@entity5 was forced off through injury *shortly* before the half - hour mark
@entity9 made a raft of changes at the break , with @entity27 , @entity76 and @entity143 among those coming on
@entity23 , one of the few players to survive @entity9 's half - time cull , scored a fine equaliser with a dipping strike early into the second half
@entity27 made it 2 - 1 with a fine individual goal in the 81st minute
