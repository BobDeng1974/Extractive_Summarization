by @entity0 last updated at 12:44 pm on 28th february 2012 there was rain , fire , soap suds and fog in the most bizarre @entity6 in history			1
when it was all over , @entity8 was the only sure thing , and it was n't even close			1
@entity8 capped a crazy 36 hours for @entity12 by winning the first postponed @entity6 in 55 editions of the marquee event			1
he held off @entity16 and @entity18 teammate @entity17 over a two - lap overtime finish in a race that was scheduled to begin sunday afternoon but ended in the early morning hours tuesday			1
journeyman driver @entity38 was leading when a problem with @entity26 's car sent him spinning under caution into a safety truck			2
the truck , which holds 200 gallons of jet kerosene , burst into flames			0
@entity26 's car slid into the grass , and he gingerly climbed from it as fire trucks rushed to the scene			1
the inferno raged on , and @entity12 red - flagged the race with 40 laps remaining			1
safe : @entity26 walks from his burning car after it collided with a track - drying truck during the @entity12 @entity6 auto race @entity12 officials were examining the track surface to determine whether the race could continue			1
' about the time you think you 've seen about everything , you see something like this , ' @entity12 president @entity63 said			0
' i think we , like everybody else , would like to see this race finished			1
this is within reason , and we think we can do that within reason			0
' we 've waited this long			0
another 30 minutes is worth trying to finish the 40 laps			0
' jet fuel poured down the surface of @entity82 at @entity83 after the accident , creating a fiery lasting image of @entity12 's biggest race of the year			1
hazard : jet fuel from the truck poured down the surface of @entity82 at @entity83 after the accident , creating a fiery lasting image of @entity12 's biggest race of the year battling the blaze : safety workers try to extinguish a fire from a jet dryer after it was hit by @entity26 , grinding the @entity6 to a halt the clean - up crews were using boxes of @entity99 laundry detergent to clean up the fuel			1
it was par for the course for this @entity6 , which was postponed for the first time in @entity12 's 54 - year history because of steady rain all day sunday at the track			1
@entity12 initially planned to restart the race at noon monday , but persistent rain forced series officials to make an early decision to hold off until 7pm			1
@entity111 stayed with its plans to broadcast the race , making it the first ever @entity6 shown in primetime and an opportunity to feature the elite @entity116			1
what 's the damage ? @entity26 's team looks over his wrecked car after he collided with a jet dryer truck during the @entity6 speaking out : @entity26 talks to reporters after the massive crash @entity124 , who fell just short of winning the title last season , started from the pole with champion @entity128 , seeking to snap an 0 - for - 13 losing streak in the @entity6 , right behind him			1
@entity130 , making the full - time move to @entity12 from @entity132 , was making her @entity6 debut			0
those storylines , however , were quickly forgotten in this bizarre 55th running of @entity12 's version of the @entity137			0
it took several minutes for safety workers to put out the fire , and then came the task of removing the truck from the track and cleaning up all that spilled fuel			1
rinse , repeat : the clean - up crews were using boxes of @entity99 laundry detergent and a lot of water to clean up the fuel on the track at the @entity83 towing the truck from the steep banking presented a challenge , as @entity12 was nervous any movement would dig into the track surface			1
@entity26 , who said his helmet was singed in the fire and his foot ached , said he felt a vibration in his car before the accident			1
' i 've hit a lot of things - but a jet dryer ? ' he said			0
' it just felt really strange , and as i was talking on the radio , the car just turned right			0
' the drivers were allowed to exit their cars after about 10 minutes under the red flag			0
@entity16 had been complaining he had to go to the bathroom , and @entity178 was posting to his @entity180 account from inside his car			0
@entity181 - flagged : the race was halted with just 40 laps to go as firefighters battled the flames erupting from the jet dryer @entity38 did not initially get out of his car , and @entity187 , who outlasted nearly two hours of delays to fix a pesky pothole during his 2010 victory , stopped at @entity38 's window to speak to the driver leading the biggest race of his career			1
as the red flag continued , the drivers began to congregate around @entity38 , and he got out of his car			0
@entity38 entered the race winless in 397 previous starts			2
the 48 - year - old from @entity200 won his only @entity12 race in 2006 in the second - tier @entity202			2
and he came into @entity6 having to race his way into the field after team owner @entity205 made a deal with @entity128 to give @entity207 the points she needed to guarantee her a spot in the @entity6			2
trouble on the track : @entity130 ( right ) , @entity213 ( left ) , @entity214 ( second from left ) and @entity215 ( second from right ) crashed into each other shortly after the race began lined up behind @entity38 was @entity219 , who was running for @entity220 , a team formed earlier this month when it purchased the assets and points from defunct @entity223 , and @entity224 , who raced his way into the @entity6 and picked up sponsorship from @entity227 presidential candidate @entity226			1
the racing was aggressive at the drop of the green flag , and the first accident occurred on just the second lap , when @entity233 ran into the back of @entity215 as they drafted around the track			2
the contact sent @entity215 into the wall , and as the five - time @entity12 champion slid back down across the track , he was hit hard in the door by @entity214			2
the accident collected six cars total , including defending @entity6 winner @entity243 and @entity207			0
' i 'm just really , really bummed to start the season this way , ' @entity215 said			0
' to work as hard as everyone did at @entity248 to get this @entity250 's @entity249 and to have it barely complete two - and - a - half miles of green flag racing is pretty sad			0
tv event : the race was the first - ever @entity6 shown in primetime and a golden opportunity to feature the elite @entity116 we 'll just go on and go to @entity257 and set our marks on winning that race			2
' he may go to @entity257 without any points : @entity12 is expected to penalize crew chief @entity262 this week for failing the first inspection of @entity264			0
@entity262 could be facing both a suspension and a loss of a points			0
it took about an hour for @entity207 's @entity270 crew to get her back on the track , and she returned 62 laps behind the leader			2
the race settled down after that , and the push for the $ 200,000 leader bonus at the halfway mark did n't spark too much excitement			2
@entity282 - studded event : attendees at this year 's @entity6 included @entity285 star @entity284 and @entity287 swimsuit cover girl @entity286 bringing the noise : rocker @entity289 also attended the event , bringing along a @entity292 guitar two - time @entity12 champion @entity293 had been running second and presumably in position to make a move for the cash , but he was spun by @entity297			0
' @entity299 , man ! who would turn the ice man around ? ' @entity16 shouted on his team radio			0
after a brief caution , the leaders had a 10 - lap sprint to the halfway point , and @entity307 used a big push from @entity309 to slide by @entity17 on the deciding lap. although he was told over his team radio to ' go get the other half , ' history did n't bode well for @entity313 : the last leader at the halfway point to win the @entity6 was @entity316 in 1992			0

@entity8 wins race that was delayed several times *due* to rain and a massive fire on the track
