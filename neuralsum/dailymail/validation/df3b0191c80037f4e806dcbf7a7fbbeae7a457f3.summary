@entity1 manager @entity0 no longer feels the need to implement a ' confrontational leadership ' style with his players because their season is going largely to plan			1
the 52 - year - old @entity7 returned to @entity8 for his second spell in charge last season but got off to a disappointing start by his own high standards and failed to win any silverware in 2013 - 14			1
this season , however , @entity1 have already won the @entity16 and boast a six - point advantage over @entity18 at the top of the @entity21 table with a game in hand			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 has revealed he has ditched his ' confrontational leadership ' style the @entity7 tactician insists he has had no reason to ' provoke ' his players during the current campaign ' this season i do n't need confrontational leadership - last season i felt i needed it a few times , ' @entity0 told reporters			1
' basically , it 's when you are ready to provoke your players to try to create some conflicts with the intention to bring out the best of them			2
' in this moment i do n't think i need that with this group because things are going in the direction i want			0
' it has not been all smooth sailing for @entity0 this season , however , as @entity1 were knocked out of the @entity48 by @entity49 ( third tier ) @entity51 and were eliminated in the last - 16 of the @entity52 by @entity53			2
' obviously you can say " but you lost in the @entity52 " , or " you lost against @entity51 " , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity1 playmaker @entity56 has matured into a ' great player ' , according to @entity0 ' but globally , generally , the way they work , the way they behave , the way they live together , their motivations , their responsibilities , their frustrations , the way they react to the negative moments , the way they react to the positive moments , the absence of complacency , all this is going well			1
' so i just need to be present			0
i do n't need to be a big leader , or even try to find strategies as a leader			0
' @entity73 forward @entity56 felt the wrath of @entity0 's ' confrontational leadership ' style last season after neglecting his defensive duties during @entity1 's @entity52 semi-final exit to @entity80			1
@entity56 , however , has been @entity1 's standout player this season but @entity0 said he is unsure if the 24 - year - old 's development is down to the criticism he received			1
' i do n't know if it was that or it was his maturity coming , his level of ambition , ' he said			0
' i just think that was a natural evolution			0
' he wants to be the best , to improve his game , score more goals			0
i still call him a kid but he 's a man			0
he 's a great player			1

@entity0 is happy with the direction his players are going in
@entity0 had to wind his players up to get reaction in previous seasons
the @entity7 tactician has labelled @entity56 a ' great player '
