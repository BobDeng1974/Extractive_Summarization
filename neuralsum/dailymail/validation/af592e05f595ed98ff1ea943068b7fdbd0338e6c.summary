around 200 mysterious stone structures have mystified experts since they were discovered in the @entity2 in 2003			1
known as the ‘ strange stone circles ’ by locals in @entity6 , the formations vary in size and shape with one intricate example resembling the sun. and now an expert has suggested they could have been used by primitive nomads to worship the sun , and may have even been a site where sacrifices were made - although the types of sacrifices is not known			1
the largest structure in this image is known as the sun circle			1
an expert has suggested they could have been used by nomads to worship the sun , and may have even been a site where sacrifices were made there are similarities between the @entity32 stones and @entity33 in @entity34			1
this includes the formations being linked with sun worshippers , the shape of the structures including so - called ' exits ' , and the fact the stones were transported to the site from outside the region			1
the circles are located in the @entity46 in @entity6 , north west @entity32 and cover more than two - and - a - half square miles ( 6.6 square km )			1
they have been filmed from above using a drone by a local tourism association , in an attempt to further understand the structures and their origins , @entity48 reported			1
experts said that the stone circles are in line with local historical traditions but very little is known about them , including their age			1
some people had assumed that they were burial sites and attempted to dig them up			2

a aerial shot is shown			0
if they were used as sacrificial sites , the type of sacrifices is not known the circles are located in the @entity46 in @entity6 , north west @entity32 , a matter of miles from @entity75 ( marked ) and cover more than two - and - a - half square miles ( 6.6 square km ) similar formations were found in @entity79 mountain in north @entity80 and archaeologists have even suggested these @entity80 rocks could help pinpoint the location of @entity85 's tomb			1
this view is shared by dr @entity87 , an archaeologist at the @entity88			0
he told @entity89 : ' first of all , they are man - made ; there is no doubt about it			0
' i have seen similar features in neighbouring @entity80 where they are well known too [ and ] they are regarded as ritual features			0
one particular stone circle is known as the ‘ @entity99 ’ ( pictured ) and is formed by four concentric circles , the largest of which measures 26 ft ( eight metres ) in diameter , with the smallest inner ring destroyed the stone structures are built on high points of the land and some are square , with ‘ exits ’ to combine certain shapes ( pictured )			1
a lack of evidence of bodies at the sites has led one expert to rule out that the formations are burial sites , instead claiming they were sacrificial worship sites for ancient nomadic people no - one is sure what the mysterious stone ' walls ' were used for			1
some people thought they may be ancient burial sites , but no bodies have been found nearby and the soil beneath the circles and squares is said to be undisturbed			1
the largest of the shapes , which features four concentric circles may have been the focus of sacrifices to a sun god			1
dr @entity87 , an archaeologist at the @entity88 said its likely the structures are burial sites			2
but a local unnamed expert believes they were used for making sacrifices to the sun god thousands of years ago			1
there is no precise date for the structure , but dr @entity87 added the first of these @entity2 stone structures might date back as early as the @entity145			2
although the more complex formations are likely ' younger and could have been constructed until the @entity148 period			0
' ' some might have served as surface marking of burial places			0
at least in @entity80 , excavations have occasionally found graves in the centre of such features			2
' others , if not the majority might denote holy places in the landscape , or places with special spiritual properties , or ritual offering / meeting places			0
' he continued that the first of these @entity2 stone structures might date back as early as the @entity145			2
this could make them up to 4,500 years old			0
although the more complex formations are likely ' younger and could have been constructed until the @entity148 period			0
' however , a local specialist told @entity170 this is unlikely because the soil beneath them is undisturbed			0
the stone formations are built on high points of the land and some are square , with ‘ exits ’			2
one particular stone circle is known as the ‘ @entity99 ’ and is formed by four concentric circles - the largest of which measures 26 ft ( eight metres ) in diameter , with the smallest inner ring destroyed			1
on the southeast of the @entity185 there are a multiple circles of different sizes			2
because of the shape of this particular circle , and a lack of evidence of bodies at the sites , the unnamed local expert told @entity170 the circles were likely to have been sacrificial worship sites for ancient nomadic people - although he did n’t elaborate on what may have been sacrificed			1
the stone circles have been compared to @entity33 in @entity34 ( pictured ) , whose origins and purpose remains largely a mystery , with some experts suggesting it too was used to worship the sun the rocks used in the structures in @entity32 ( pictured ) are not from the desert where the circles are located , suggesting that they were brought from afar , much like @entity33 ’s famous bluestones ' across central @entity214 these circles are usually sacrificial sites , ’ he said			1
‘ we can image that this was a site for worshipping the god of the sun. ' he explained that the circles are all located on higher ground , which fits the selection conditions for ancient worship ceremonies			1
the stone circles may be compared to @entity33 in @entity34 , whose origins and purpose remains largely a mystery , with some experts suggesting it too was used to worship the sun. scattered across @entity230 are 12 giant circular structures that can only be fully seen using aerial and satellite images			1
known collectively as the @entity233 , the vast rings - which range from between 720ft and 1,490ft ( 220 metres to 455 metres ) in diameter - were first spotted from the air in the 1920s , and surveys in 1930 , 1953 and 2002 have since revealed more details about their size , shape and locations			0
archaeologists from @entity244 have documented 12 of them to try and learn more about their purpose			0
a total of eight big circles have been recorded in west central @entity230 , between the @entity248 and the edge of the @entity251 escarpment			2
there is also a second group , made of four @entity233 , just north of @entity254			0
pictured is circle @entity256 , known locally as @entity257			0
it is located 2.4 miles ( 4km ) west of the @entity259 and @entity260 there are eight @entity233 in west central @entity230 , a second group , made of four big circles just north of @entity254			2
plus , a more recent @entity263 spotted in 2002 near @entity264 in @entity265			0
like the mysterious structures in @entity32 , their construction is simple and typically consists of low walls of uncut boulders			1
however , they are incredibly precise and because they are so large , would have involved teams of workers			0
professor @entity274 from the university , said an ‘ architect ’ would have plotted the circles using rope tied to a post in the centre ‘ some show signs of greater care with stones at least roughly shaped and laid in courses ’ he added			2
dating is also said to be problematic , but there is often material in or around the circles that originated in the @entity290 and @entity145 ( between 2,000 to @entity291 )			2
a number of the circles contain later material , typically dating to the @entity295 period between 1st and 7th century @entity296 in another parallel , the rocks at the site in @entity32 are not from the desert where the circles are located , suggesting that they were brought from afar , just like @entity33 ’s famous bluestones			1
the sun circle itself is made from over 200 of these mysterious stones			1
although not identical , due to their much more complex design , geoglyphs in @entity307 have equally baffled experts about the practices of ancient groups			0
more commonly known as the @entity312 , they were first spotted in 1939 when a pilot flew over the @entity315 planes of the @entity307 coastal highlands			0
they were designated as a @entity318 in 1994 and the area stretches more than 50 miles ( 80km ) between the towns of @entity312 and @entity321 , about 400 km south of @entity322			2
experts have said that the stone circles ( pictured ) are in line with local historical traditions , but very little is known about them , including their age the circles and squares ( pictured ) are all located on higher ground , which fits the selection conditions for ancient worship ceremonies contrary to the popular belief that the figures can only be seen from the air , they are actually visible from the surrounding foothills			1
@entity338 , from @entity339 , is credited as the first scholar to seriously study the @entity312			0
he discovered that the lines converged at the winter solstice in the @entity343			0
along with @entity344 , a @entity345 mathematician and archaeologist , @entity338 proposed the figures were markers on the horizon to show where the sun and other celestial bodies rose			0

mysterious circular and square structures are found in @entity6 , @entity32
they are known as ' the strange circles ' by people living in the area
the 200 marks are formed from rocks that are not found in the desert
expert suggests they could have been used by nomads to worship the sun
