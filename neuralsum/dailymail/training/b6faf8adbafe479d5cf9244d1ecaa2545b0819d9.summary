by @entity0 if you ca n’t remember where you left your watering can and have n’t seen your secateurs for years , you are not alone			0
more than half of us are intermittent gardeners who rather than carefully water our borders are more likely to hope it rains			1
a study of horticultural habits has identified six categories of gardener – with 18 per cent falling into a ‘ hands - off ’ group who rely on the weather to take care of their plants			1
occasional : of those who do some gardening , most admit to hoping for rain to keep their plants healthy they are likely to tidy up their gardens every spring , but rarely take any other action to look after their green space			1
the findings were part of a wide - ranging study into water usage in south - east @entity34			1
the team of researchers from the universities of @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 investigated the daily habits of 1,800 households , with the aim of developing better water usage policy			2
some 56 per cent of those surveyed fell into the two categories who never watered their gardens			2
a vast majority - 91 per cent of those they surveyed - had some kind of outdoor space at their home , 87 per cent including a back garden			1
but 38 per cent said they had ‘ nothing to water ’ - in many cases because they had paved over their lawn or simply had abandoned their plants			1
another 18 per cent said they rely on rain to keep their gardens irrigated			1
dr @entity65 , of the @entity66 , said there are six ‘ broad variants ’ of gardener - with no obvious link to their socioeconomic class or professional standing			2
she said : ‘ the overriding impression is that they ’re not as green fingered as @entity77 fans might imagine - that ’s assuming they have any plants at all , or feel that those they do have need to be watered			2
’ another 18 per cent of people were classified as ‘ casual gardeners ’ , the kind of people who have a few token shrubs or potted flowers			0
they use a jug or watering can to tend to their plants , filling it up from the kitchen sink or an outdoor tap			0
some 16 per cent are ‘ high - tec gardeners ’ , keen horticulturists who use a hosepipe , sprinkler or automated irrigation system to keep the lawn green and flowers in good health			2
the researchers grouped 5 per cent into a ‘ green fingered ’ category			0
these gardeners are committed environmentalists , using recycled water such as rain in outdoor butts , or even carefully collected waste bath or kitchen water			1
@entity111 fingered folk are likely to grow fruit , vegetables and native flowers , the academics said , and often feed and nurture the wildlife in their gardens			1
a final category is made up of ‘ amateur enthusiasts ’ , those with small gardens , usually in city centres , but who are serious about horticulture			2
they are likely to grow their own fruit and vegetables , often in pots or tubs , and use a watering can to keep everything healthy			0
the research team said the findings has implications for the effectiveness of water policy			0
the paper , published in the @entity139 , said : ‘ [ the results ] serve to illustrate that how individuals water the garden varies , often with little relationship to their sociodemographic characteristics			1
‘ fully 56 per cent of respondents reported that their gardening practice involved no watering , with clear water use implications			0
‘ it is notable how many households do not water their gardens , and also how many only use jugs or watering cans			1
’ the authors also suggested that even those who do use lots of water might be improving the environment in other ways			0
the paper said : ‘ garden watering overlaps with other substantial environmental issues , such as the potential beneficial effects of planting native species or having wild areas for biodiversity , or growing food at home , potentially reducing food miles			0
‘ trade - offs between agendas may then exist : encouraging reduced water use per se might not be the best goal			1
’ dr @entity65 said the findings show that hosepipe bans in times of drought might only affect a small proportion of people			0
‘ our findings provide food for thought for those implementing hosepipe bans and non-essential use bans , ’ she said			0
‘ although these bans do raise awareness of the importance of using less water , we think it would be good to think about different approaches to tackling behaviour leading up to drought			1
‘ we also urge the water industry to think differently how they might intervene to improve water efficiency			0
’ ‘ the garden is one of the few areas of watering practices over which policy makers can provide external control through non-essential use bans			0
so these results may provide useful insight in terms of identifying trigger points for action and communication in periods of drought			0

survey *outlined* different approaches to caring for gardens
a majority admit they never bother to water the garden themselves
many say they take no care at all - and many that do still just hope for rain
