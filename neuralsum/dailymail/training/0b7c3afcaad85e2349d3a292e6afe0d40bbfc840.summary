by @entity0 police enjoyed free tickets for eight years to watch a top @entity4 side at the centre of an anti-corruption inquiry			0
dozens of officers and staff took advantage of six @entity12 season tickets provided by the wealthy @entity14 club			1
the deal will deepen concerns about the cosy relationship between it and the @entity19			1
earlier this month the @entity20 revealed star player @entity21 faces questions over how three @entity24 detectives ended up in his private box at a match			1
the freebie : detective sergeant @entity28 ( left ) and @entity21 ( second left ) in the player ’s box at the @entity31 with a youth , an unidentified fan and detective constable @entity34 ( far right ) , who was not involved in the investigation just 24 hours earlier some of them were tasked with speaking to him after his car collided with a photographer outside his home			1
senior politicians tasked with overseeing the @entity19 said the season ticket deal raises worrying questions about the impartiality of police			1
baroness @entity46 said : ‘ accepting hospitality like this gives the impression that not everyone is equal before the law and that favours can be bought			0
’ the ticket deal began in 2005 when @entity12 agreed to hand over six season tickets every year to police in the @entity14 borough of @entity57			1
the sought - after seats were handed out on a ‘ match - by - match ’ basis to officers and staff as a reward for good work , the @entity19 said			2
it is not known how much the tickets were worth , but the cheapest @entity12 season ticket for the 2014/15 season is £ 985 and the most expensive almost £ 2,000			1
@entity34 was photographed grinning as she shook hands with @entity21 probe : @entity69 on the night of the incident			2
freelance photographer @entity71 dialled 999 claiming @entity21 had driven his @entity73 into him , knocking his arm with a wing mirror but the hospitality , worth tens of thousands of pounds , was abruptly stopped when a new area chief took charge last year			2
the season ticket deal was revealed as questions over the conduct of @entity12 and @entity83 final star @entity21 remain unanswered			1
the @entity85 faces being quizzed on his return to @entity14 over the presence of three detectives in his private box at a match in february			0
just 24 hours earlier a police inquiry was launched when a photographer claimed he was assaulted by the star after being hit by his car			1
@entity21 ( centre ) scores for @entity12 in the @entity4 against @entity98 last season two of the detectives at the match are believed to have been asked to assist that investigation which was dropped within weeks			1
bureaucrats in a traffic office wrote to the photographer to tell him the inquiry was over and blamed the lack of ‘ independent evidence ’			0
all three detectives , who were initially suspended from frontline duties , face being questioned under caution later this month for potential misconduct			0
colleagues insist the trio are guilty of nothing more than ‘ stupidity ’ but chiefs are concerned their actions may have brought the force into disrepute			0
the tickets were not the only gestures of goodwill from @entity12 to the police force			1
it donated a £ 640 camera to its football liaison team and gave police use of two vehicles , a @entity132 van and a @entity134 car			0
the force also paid hundreds of thousands of pounds towards the cost of policing matches at its @entity31 ground			0
@entity139 , a @entity14 @entity140 politician , said : ‘ before accepting any hospitality every police officer should ask fundamental questions as to whether acceptance is good for policing and how it would be perceived by the public			0
‘ it seems staggering that for so long a number of police officers in @entity57 completely failed to ask such basic questions and ignored the @entity19 ’s own gifts and hospitality rules			2
’ the misconduct probe is a potential embarrassment for commissioner sir @entity155 , a @entity156 fan who regularly plays competitive 5 - a - side			0
earlier this month he led a conference at the @entity31 for some of the force ’s most senior officers			1
up to 800 chief inspectors and superintendents attended an event at the @entity12 ground aimed at improving the working culture of the force			2
a @entity19 spokesman said : ‘ between 2005 and early 2013 , @entity12 donated approximately six season tickets per year to @entity170			1
‘ these tickets were used on a match by match basis to recognise good work and community spirited work undertaken by police officers and staff and members of the public			2
‘ the allocation of the tickets was recorded on the borough and there was senior officer oversight			0
‘ in february 2013 the arrangement was reviewed by the new borough commander and stopped			0
’ an @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ we have always worked closely with the @entity19 who are hugely important to our activities and the safe running of our matches			0
' the tickets were provided for the force to use at their discretion under the oversight of a senior officer			0
