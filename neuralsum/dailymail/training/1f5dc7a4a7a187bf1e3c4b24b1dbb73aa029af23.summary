judge @entity13 , who wondered aloud why the bankruptcy had not happened years ago , said pensions can be altered just like any contract because the @entity17 does not offer bulletproof protection for employee benefits			1
but he signaled a desire for a measured approach and warned city officials that they must be prepared to defend any deep reductions			1
it 's insolvent , ' @entity13 said in formally granting @entity3 the largest public bankruptcy in @entity36 history			1
' it the same time , it also has an opportunity for a fresh start			0
' the ruling came more than four months after @entity3 filed for chapter 9 protection			2
@entity13 agreed with unions and pension funds that the city 's emergency manager , @entity44 , had not negotiated in good faith in the weeks ahead of the july filing , a key condition under federal law			1

perhaps years , ' the judge said			1
the decision set the stage for officials to confront $ 18 billion in debt with a plan that might pay creditors just pennies on the dollar and is sure to include touchy negotiations over the pensions of about 23,000 retirees and 9,000 workers			1
@entity44 says pension funds are short by $ 3.5 billion			0
@entity13 promised that he would not ' lightly or casually ' sign off on just any cuts			2
the city has argued that bankruptcy protection will allow it to help beleaguered residents who for years have tolerated slow police responses , darkened streetlights and erratic garbage pickup - a concern mentioned by the judge during a nine - day trial that ended nov. 8			1
before the july filing , nearly 40 cents of every dollar collected by @entity3 was used to pay debt , a figure that could rise to 65 cents without relief through bankruptcy , according to the city			1
retiree @entity89 talks to the media outside the federal courthouse in @entity3 on tuesday after judge @entity13 ruled on the city 's bankruptcy filing @entity44 praised the judge 's ruling and pledged to ' press ahead			1

' most of us did n't have too much faith in the court			0
... the working class is becoming the have - nots , ' @entity102 said outside the courthouse			0
' i 'm broke up and beat up			0
i 'm going to pray a whole lot			0
' @entity115 , a retired clerical worker , said she may need to find work but added : ' how many folks are going to hire a 60 - year - old woman ? ' the judge spoke for more than an hour in a packed courtroom , reciting @entity3 's proud history as the diverse , hard - working @entity3 devoted to auto manufacturing			1
@entity3 is officially bankrupt after suffering double - digit unemployment , catastrophic debt deals , thousands of vacant homes and wave after wave of population loss but he then tallied a list of warts : double - digit unemployment , catastrophic debt deals , thousands of vacant homes and wave after wave of population loss			2
behind closed doors , mediators led by another judge have been meeting with @entity44 's team and creditors for weeks to explore possible settlements			2
the judge has told the city to come up with a plan by march 1 to exit bankruptcy			1
@entity44 has said he would like to have one ready weeks earlier			0
the city is so desperate for money that it may consider auctioning off masterpieces from the @entity147 and selling a water department that serves much of southeastern @entity149			0
' we need to recognize that this decision is a call to action , ' gov. @entity150 , who supported the bankruptcy filing , said on tuesday			2
' we are confronting fiscal realities that have been ignored for too long			0
' @entity156 , attorney representing the @entity157 said city officials got ' absolutely everything ' in judge @entity13 ' decision and is planing to appeal minutes after the ruling , a union lawyer said she would appeal			1
city officials got ' absolutely everything ' in @entity13 ' decision , she told reporters			1
' it 's a huge loss for the city of @entity3 , ' said @entity156 , an attorney for the @entity157 , which represents half of city workers			1
@entity44 , a bankruptcy expert , was appointed in march under a @entity149 law that allows a governor to send a manager to distressed cities , townships or school districts			0
a manager has extraordinary powers to reshape local finances without interference from elected officials			0
by july , @entity44 and @entity150 decided bankruptcy was @entity3 's best option			2
@entity3 , a manufacturing hub that offered well - paying blue - collar jobs , peaked at 1.8 million residents in 1950 but has lost more than a million people since then			0
outgoing mayor @entity189 will be replaced in january by former hospital executive @entity190 , he first white mayor in largely black @entity3 since the 1970s , in january with more square mileage than @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 combined , the city does not have enough tax revenue to reliably cover pensions , retiree health insurance and buckets of debt sold to keep the budget afloat			1
donors have written checks for new police cars and ambulances			0
a new agency has been created to revive tens of thousands of streetlights that are dim or simply broken after years of vandalism and mismanagement			0
former hospital executive @entity190 takes over as mayor in january , the third mayor since @entity215 quit in a scandal in 2008 and the first white mayor in largely black @entity3 since the 1970s			0
