by @entity0 published : 10:30 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 17:53 est , 10 august 2013 in a white , immaculate interior , there stands a white , immaculate yacht			2
but this is no ordinary yacht - it is one of the most luxurious ones that money can buy ... and this is the almost heavenly place where they are built			2
the workshop is owned by @entity12 - based company @entity11 , which specialises in unique , high - performance boats			1
their clients range from your average captain of industry to multimillionaires with a @entity21 fixation - which is just as well as the vessels can cost as much as £ 20million			1
the @entity28 , above , is 86ft long at 164ft in length , @entity32 , @entity33 , is the biggest carbon fibre sloop so far built by the company these images , photographed by @entity37 , show three different vessels : @entity28 , a motorised yacht ; @entity40 , a single - deck , with 630 horsepower ; and @entity32 , @entity33 , which at 164ft is the biggest carbon fibre sloop so far built by the company			1
and to give an idea of its owner 's wealth , the latter was in the process of being painted the same color as their @entity48			2
mr @entity50 , who specialises in shooting jets , cars and boats during their production , said : ' these were shot as part of a slight rebrand that i think came to a halt , which was a real shame as we never got round to shooting the final images of the yachts when they had been launched			2
' i would love my own boat and ca n't see myself not owning one at some point , but maybe not as grand as @entity33			0
the company 's clients range from your average captain of industry to multimillionaires with a @entity21 fixation - which is just as well as the vessels can cost in excess of £ 20m			1
above , @entity33 @entity40 ( above ) is 43ft long , and comes in a choice of colours including blue , black , white , red and green mr @entity37 said ' the yachts ride so well and so smoothly			0
' above , @entity40 ' i 've heard it costs approximately 10 per cent of the build costs to run a boat each year - and the saying goes " the two best days of owning a yacht are the day you buy it and the day you sell it "			1
' @entity40 is believed to cost around £ 300,000 ; @entity28 , £ 3.5million ; and @entity33 , £ 20million			1
the photoshoot took place in three locations which have dedicated @entity92 : @entity93 ( for @entity32 , @entity33 ) and @entity94 ( @entity28 ) , both in @entity95 ; and @entity12 ( @entity40 )			1
' the shoot at @entity93 was unbelievably uncomfortable , ' the photographer added			0
@entity99 powerhouse , just a small section of the machinery driving @entity40 the photoshoot took place in three locations which have dedicated @entity92 : @entity93 ( for @entity32 , @entity33 ) and @entity94 ( @entity28 ) , both in @entity95 ; and @entity12 ( @entity40 ) ' it was a ridiculously hot day and we spent most of it under a tarpaulin or inside a boat with no moving air and lots of wood dust and sweat dripping off us			1
' the yachts ride so well and so smoothly			0
' on the second day			0
we saw @entity115 , [ @entity117 business tycoon ] @entity119 's mega-yacht			0
i can see why they called it @entity115 - it dwarfed everything			2
as to the cost of running them ... these behemoths can easily glug 15 gallons of fuel per nautical mile			0
but if you can afford to buy one of them , surely that added financial burden is just a drop in the ocean			0
