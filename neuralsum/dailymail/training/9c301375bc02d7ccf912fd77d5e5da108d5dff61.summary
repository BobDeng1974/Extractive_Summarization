@entity2 , a lawyer , said women ‘ face a series of stark choices ’ , while men can ‘ toy with unlimited options ’			1
mrs @entity2 , known as @entity2 professionally , said women are described as ‘ scary ’ if they are successful in their careers , ‘ shallow ’ if they follow fashion and ‘ fluffy ’ if they read women ’s magazines			1
mrs @entity2 , a partner at @entity23 law firm @entity22 , said it was not surprising that many young girls struggled to find their identity			1
she added that there needed to be more visible female role models for girls to succeed			2
she quoted figures from @entity31 , which claims 55 per cent of girls aged between 11 and 21 feel there are not enough female role models			0
on the contrary mrs @entity2 , who has three children with deputy prime minister mr @entity8 , said there was a ‘ surplus ’ of female role models			1
as a result , she is helping to launch a national campaign , called inspiring the @entity41 , which will encourage women from all backgrounds to visit schools and talk to girls about their jobs			1
mrs @entity2 said : ‘ i believe that every woman has a role model inside her : the role models of our everyday lives			1
’ she added : ‘ it is little wonder that girls struggle , amid so many absurd labels , struggle to identify the right path for them			0
‘ as it is equally little wonder that , when threatened with that same flurry of labels , many female role models refuse to stick their necks out			0
‘ and yet while men are able to toy with unlimited options , we still face a series of stark choices			1
‘ if we do not have children , people assume we are “ frustrated ”			0
if we stay at home taking care of our children , it is said we are “ not working ”			0
‘ if we have a job , we are portrayed as just “ part - time mums ” , and sometimes even as bad parents			0
‘ if we succeed in our professional lives , we ’re branded “ scary ” ; if we follow fashion , we ’re “ shallow ” ; if we like science , we ’re “ geeks ” ; if we read women ’s magazines , we ’re “ fluffy ” , and if we defend our rights , we ’re “ hard ”			2
’ the campaign will start with a ‘ career speed - dating ’ event on october 17 , in which 100 girls from @entity88 state schools will meet ten successful women			1
the nine other women taking part in the launch event include @entity95 news reader @entity93 ( left ) and @entity96 , ceo of @entity98 ( right ) the nine other women taking part in the launch event include @entity95 news reader @entity93 and @entity96 , ceo of @entity98			2
after the first event , the charity will continue to encourage women to speak for one hour about their career in state schools			2
she told the @entity107 : ‘ it is our duty to guarantee that all that potential does not go to waste			0
those girls should not have to limit their dreams and feel constrained by absurd and demeaning stereotypes			0
‘ they should rather feel free to aim high – high in their jobs , and high in their lives			0
‘ the new generation of girls are clever , engaged and curious ; they are ambitious , but in a realistic way ; they are not afraid of hard work and they are determined to shine			0
