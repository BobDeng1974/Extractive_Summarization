from mrs @entity0 to @entity1 , these barking mad illustrations show the animal side of @entity5 's most - loved characters			1
the art works entitled ' @entity7 ' , were designed by illustrator and artist @entity9 , 39 , after she combined her love of drawing and @entity5			1
' i 've been painting portraits of animals in historical costume for some time , ' explains the @entity16			1
very paw - sh : @entity5 's @entity18 , played by @entity19 , trades places with this @entity21 doppelganger : @entity23 as mr @entity24 in @entity25 's @entity5 ( left ) and ( right ) @entity27 's animal recreation of him using a clumber spaniel ' i 've taken some familiar and beloved characters whose demeanour , personality , and appearance seemed to translate to certain breeds of dog or cat			1
' i got to thinking about mr @entity38 ' character and storyline , and @entity41 's facial structure , and how he could look hard but also had the warmest , kindest eyes			2
' in all those ways , the character reminded me very much of the much - maligned , often misunderstood pit bull dogs that fill animal shelters			2
' so , i wondered if i could paint a portrait of a character , but with a realistic dog , and make it recognisable			2
a dalmatian replaced @entity5 's @entity52 , countess of @entity53 , played by @entity54 @entity5 actor @entity41 as @entity38 ( left ) and a dog ( right ) ' i was pleased with the result , so i tried my hand at more characters			2
as i worked on one , ideas for others would come			0
' by the time season three of @entity5 aired , me and my husband were hooked , so it was relativity easy to pick out characters			0
' painted digitally using just a drawing tablet connected to the computer , one work alone can take mrs @entity9 up to 20 hours to complete			1
the artist said : ' people seem to find them delightful if they 're fans of the show			1
my best moment was when i was speaking with a woman at an art festival			0
@entity76 as @entity77 ( left ) , @entity78 of @entity53 and the widow of the late @entity80 , and ( right ) a @entity82 cat ' as she was talking , her gaze focused past my shoulder and she trailed off speaking for a moment and then said , ' that cat looks like @entity76			0
' ' she had n't seen @entity5 , but she had seen the @entity89 films , and she recognised the sphynx cat as @entity76 's character			0
' it was all i could do not to hug her			0
making them look like people was hard to do without hair , but i did n't want to put wigs on them			0
@entity5 's @entity98 , played by @entity99 , swaps with this @entity101 shepherd @entity25 's costume drama series @entity5 is written and created by @entity104 - winning writer @entity103 and made by @entity105 lady @entity106 , played by @entity107 , is turned into a @entity109 cat in the dog and cat @entity5 collection mrs @entity0 is replaced by a fluffy ginger cat , created by artist @entity9 @entity5 's @entity114 ( left ) , played by @entity115 , trades places with an @entity118 water spaniel ' people keep asking why i have n't drawn mrs. @entity120 , or @entity53 , or @entity121			1
' mrs @entity120 did n't bring any animal pictures to mind and i left her out , instead of trying to shoehorn her into something just to tick a box			1
' @entity53 would have to have been his own yellow @entity126 , but if i did that , i would have felt compelled to draw @entity128 somehow , and that got into weird @entity131 - and - @entity130 - are - both - dogs territory			0
' as for @entity121 , i would have happily drawn him , but the pajama pants were simultaneously the most intriguing but the most inappropriate			0
