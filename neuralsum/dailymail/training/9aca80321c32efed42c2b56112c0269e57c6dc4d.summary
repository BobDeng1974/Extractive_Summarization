but they have clearly not been paying attention to this year ’s @entity6			1
the hit baking show has been accused of favouritism towards its female contestants after the last man was eliminated from the series with three episodes still remaining			1
a string of male viewers – including celebrity chef @entity24 and two former competitors – complained after teacher @entity5 , 37 , was voted off this week ’s show , leaving five women to compete in next week ’s quarter final			1
one - last year ’s runner up @entity29 - said his faith in the show was ‘ completely lost ’ and threatened to start watching @entity33 show @entity32 instead			2
he added : ‘ should be renamed ‘ @entity34 ’			1
tuesday ’s episode was watched by 6.3million viewers , a series record and the second highest audience in the @entity41 show ’s history			2
but its 1.9million male fans saw the last remaining male baker struggle with his puff pastry and watch in dismay when his showstopper @entity47 collapsed in a sticky mess			2
mr @entity49 was the fourth man to be voted off in a row , prompting dismay among male viewers			1
writing on @entity53 , mr @entity29 said : ' @entity54			2
faith in # @entity34 completely lost			1
next week , i ’m watching @entity32			2
' last man standing in # @entity34 is sent packing			1
an all - women show from now on			0
should be re-named “ @entity34 ”			1
’ celebrity chef @entity24 was equally disappointed , saying : ‘ i so did n’t want that to happen			0
# @entity34 so disappointing such a lovely man ! ’ and the winner of the first @entity64 series , @entity6 , also showed his allegiances were with the last remaining man , saying : ‘ @entity68 so sorry to see you go , you ’ve been absolutely fabulous ! # gbbo			1
’ the episode was watched by 6.3million viewers , a series record and the second highest audience in the @entity41 show ¿ s history the @entity64 crown will now be contested by @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			0

last week , some noticed ‘ sexual tension ’ between 47 - year - old @entity89 – who split from his wife in may – and 21 - year - old @entity92			0
now viewers complained the attractive philosophy student , who is a former model , was treated differently to the others			0
one tweeted : ‘ @entity79 gets way to much favouritism from @entity85 and @entity83			0
’ another added : ‘ i hope @entity85 does n’t do his usual flirtatious favouritism with @entity79 again this week , it ’s getting tiresome			0
’ a third said : ‘ i am actually considering stopping watching # gbbo i have never seen anything so blatantly fixed in one person ’s favour			0
’ two of the three @entity64 series so far have been won by men , with last year ’s final an all - male affair			0
but many male viewers said this year ’s series showed the traditional sexual roles have been re-established			0
one said : ‘ this program proves that men are crap cooks & a woman ’s place is well & truly in the kitchen			0
’ a female fan replied : ‘ women are the best bakers ! # @entity34			1
