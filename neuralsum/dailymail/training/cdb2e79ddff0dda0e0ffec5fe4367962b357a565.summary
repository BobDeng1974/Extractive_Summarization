@entity6 , a member of the @entity7 who was awarded the @entity8 for his wartime service in november , suffered a heart attack on march 31			1

the @entity30 @entity29 used codetalkers in every @entity33 assault from 1942 to 1945			0
the @entity1 used a code based on their language , which was never cracked by the @entity36			1
it was estimated that outside of tribes , fewer than 30 people understood the @entity40 during the @entity4			0
native american language had also been used for code purposes in the @entity43			1
the code was made up of unrelated @entity46 words that would be translated into @entity47			2
the first letter of the translated word would then be used to build up the message			0
when the @entity29 developed the code they had to create new words in the language to incorporate military terms , including ' besh - lo ' meaning iron fish for submarine , and ' dah - he - tih - hi ' , which translates as humming bird , for fighter planes			1
the @entity62 , as the @entity29 became known , were essential to the war effort , with @entity64 , a @entity65 signal officer , saying : ' were it not for the @entity66 , the @entity29 would never have taken @entity67			0
' source : @entity69 and @entity70 he explained how @entity6 , who was part of the 195th @entity73 , was walking through an orchard in southern @entity18 in 1944 when he heard a fellow soldier singing in the @entity77 dialect			1

he added that his uncle , a teacher and classical pianist , ' was a distinct character '			0
@entity6 , like all code talkers , worked on the radio to transmit and receive messages			1
the @entity1 were mainly used by the @entity29 , who had created an unbreakable code created from the @entity66 language by the tribe members in their ranks			1
the war - time efforts of @entity6 and his fellow @entity127 code talkers inspired the 2002 @entity129 film @entity62 , which revealed the lengths the @entity30 @entity29 went to protect their secret weapon			1
the skills and code talking ability of the @entity1 was so essential to the war effort that they were highly protected to prevent anything happening to them			2
a @entity36 intelligence chief said after the war that although his forces could decipher codes used by the @entity144 and @entity145 , they remained unable to break the @entity147 code			2
elite : @entity6 was one of the @entity127 codetalkers used in the @entity4 vital : the work of the @entity127 codetalkers was celebrated in the 2002 film @entity62 part of the success of the code was the complexities of the @entity66 language , which did n't have an alphabet and was understood by fewer than 30 people outside of the tribes			1

the code was considered so valuable that it was kept classified for years , and the @entity1 who worked as codetalkers were n't recognized for their war efforts until 1992			2
