when scores of dead seals with mysterious ' corkscrew ' injuries began washing up on shores , all sorts of theories were put forward			1
boat propellers were the chief suspect , although hungry sharks and attacks by aggressive territorial male seals were n't ruled out			1
scientists , the @entity12 , @entity13 and even police investigated the disturbing phenomenon			1
but now academics believe they have found the answer – cannibalism			0
cannibalism victim : one of the 50 bloodied seals washed up dead on beaches across @entity23			1
experts now believe the fatal injuries were caused by hungry adult males a team of marine biologists concluded the horrific lacerations – likened to be being passed through a giant pencil sharpener - could have been caused by hungry adult males			2
dr @entity31 , senior research assistant at the @entity32 in @entity33 , said : ' our investigations have led us to believe that it is highly likely cannibalism was the cause			0
' scientists were stumped by the deaths of more than 50 grey and common seals found on an eight - mile stretch of coast between @entity44 and @entity45 on the @entity43 between november 2009 and august 2010			1
the problem was also identified in @entity33			0
in the @entity48 , seven seals were found dead out of a breeding population of only 150			2
another 18 were discovered in @entity50 and the @entity51			0
all had the unusual injuries - a smooth - edged cut that spiralled up to two times around the body			2
post-mortem examinations failed to provide an answer but researchers guessed the likely cause was a rotating single blade			0
seals normally swim away from noisy boats but they theorised they could be sucked in by an as yet unidentified vessel			0
the breakthrough came after a student researcher at @entity50 ' @entity66 saw an adult seal force a pup under water			1
under attack : the common seal ( left ) and grey seals ( right ) are believed to have been viciously attacked by hungry adult males			1
the corkscrew injuries were initially blamed on boat propellers until an expert witnessed an attack on a pup which resulted in similar lacerations during the brutal attack , it held its victim with its fore - flippers and clamped its jaws around its neck			1
it then pulled upward while pushing down with the flippers , leaving the corkscrew incision			0
dr @entity31 – whose team tagged a number of grey seals in the @entity51 for the study - added about six a year had been found dead with the same injuries for the past two years			2
' seal cannibalism is rare but not unheard of and our research has shown evidence of seals killing this way back in the late 1980s , ' he said			2
' we ca n't be 100 per cent certain this is what happened in @entity43 but we believe it is highly likely to be the case			0
' @entity44 harbour master @entity103 said : ' people here are very passionate about seals and we took a lot of stick at the time when people thought it was the wind farm boats causing the deaths			2
' it 's nice to be able to show that this was not the case			0
' @entity122 , of the @entity23 @entity123 , added : ' while the horrific injuries remain a cause for concern , the evidence that these were predominantly the result of attacks by other seals demonstrates why accurate science should drive the debate rather than raw emotion			1
' the deaths were of particular concern because populations of common seals had already been devastated			1
outbreaks of the phocine distemper virus in 1988 and 2002 resulted in losses of around 20 per cent			0
numbers have made a slow recovery since then .			0

about 50 seals with *bizarre* injuries washed up on @entity143 beaches
scientists , @entity13 , @entity12 and even police investigated deaths
breakthrough after student saw male carry out attack on pup
deaths a concern as seal population has struggled since deadly virus
