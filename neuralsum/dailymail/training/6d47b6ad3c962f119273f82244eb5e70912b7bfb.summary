by @entity0 published : 09:15 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 09:20 est , 18 july 2013 a device that can diagnose attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and teenagers has been approved for use			0
the @entity10 is now allowing marketing of the device which measures brain function to help assess whether a child has the condition			1
it is designed to be used to confirm a doctor ’s diagnosis , or to make up part of a complete examination which would also include psychological tests			1
the @entity22 ( @entity24 ) system records different electrical impulses given off by nerve cells in the brain , and the number of times the impulses are given off each second			1
during a 15 minute non-invasive test it calculates the ratio of two standard brain waves – theta and beta waves			0
the theta / beta ratio has been shown to be higher in children and adolescents with @entity4 than in children without it			0
‘ diagnosing adhd is a multi-step process based on a complete medical and psychiatric exam , ’ said @entity43 , director of the @entity44 at the @entity10 ’s @entity45			0
‘ the @entity49 , along with other clinical information , may help healthcare providers more accurately determine if @entity4 is the cause of a behavioural problem			1
’ to test the device , a clinical study was carried out that evaluated 275 children and adolescents ranging from six to 17 - years - old with attention or behavioural issues			0
clinicians evaluated all 275 patients using the @entity49 and using standard diagnostic techniques , including behavioural questionnaires , iq testing , and physical examinations to determine if the patient had adhd			0
an independent group of @entity4 experts reviewed the data and decided on a diagnosis			2
the study results showed that the use of the @entity49 helped doctors make a more accurate diagnosis of @entity4 when it was used in conjunction with a clinical assessment for @entity4 , compared with doing the clinical assessment alone			1
the @entity22 ( @entity24 ) system records different electrical impulses given off by nerve cells in the brain , and the number of times the impulses are given off each second however , not all experts have welcomed the device			1
some doctors believe that clinical examinations are sufficient to diagnose adhd and claim that using this device would just increase the cost of diagnosis			2
@entity4 is one of the most common behavioural disorders in childhood			2
children with @entity4 have difficulty with attention , hyperactivity , impulsiveness , and behavioural problems .			0

the @entity10 is now allowing marketing of the @entity22 ( @entity24 ) system
it measures electrical impulses from nerve cells to help diagnose behavioural condition @entity4
can be used to back up a doctor *'s* diagnosis or as part of full examination
some doctors do not believe it is necessary and think it just adds expense
