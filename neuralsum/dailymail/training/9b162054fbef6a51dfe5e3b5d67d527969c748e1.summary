a gang of computer hackers is believed to have stolen tens of millions of pounds from @entity3 banks in the largest cyber-crime ever detected			1
the massive theft was part of a bold £ 650million raid , meticulously orchestrated over the past two years , on more than 100 financial institutions around the world			1
attacks by the gang , thought to be based in @entity11 but with members in @entity13 and @entity14 , are feared to be continuing , despite being investigated by @entity15 and international authorities			1
a gang of computer hackers is believed to have stolen tens of millions of pounds from @entity3 banks by ordering atm machines to dispense cash at pre-determined times – even without a bank card			1
it is unknown which banks have been targeted , and the scale of losses to @entity3 banks has not been disclosed ( file photo ) the computer scam was so sophisticated that the gang , known as @entity31 , was apparently able to order atm machines to dispense cash at pre-determined times – even without a bank card			1
the cyber-criminals would pull off a raid by first gaining entry into a bank employee 's computer			2
they did this by sending authentic - looking emails that unsuspecting recipients then clicked on , inadvertently infecting the bank 's machines with @entity31 malware – a technique known as ' spear phishing '			2
hackers were then able to infiltrate the internal network and track down administrators ' computers for video surveillance			0
this allowed them to see and record everything that happened on the screens of staff who serviced the cash transfer systems , which meant the fraudsters got to know and could mimic every last detail of bank clerks ' work			1
the cyber-criminals were able to hack into a bank employee 's computer , allowing them to record everything happening on - screen and then mimic workers online to transfer money into dummy accounts ( file photo ) they used this information to impersonate bank staff online , in order to electronically transfer tens of millions of pounds from the bank into dummy accounts			1
on average , each robbery took between two and four months , from infecting the first computer at the bank 's corporate network to making off with the money			2
another method used was where the criminals would gain access to someone 's account and inflate the balance many times over before transferring the cash			1
the raids , which date back to 2013 , were finally detected by @entity11 cyber security firm @entity95 , after a @entity13 atm was found to be giving out notes at random times - when no one had put in a card or touched a button			1
the scale of the crime was global , with banks in the @entity106 , @entity14 , @entity11 and @entity107 targeted			0
security experts are trying to identify the banks hit but say customers , such as this man , have not been affected ( file photo ) security cameras showed how money would be picked up by customers who appeared to be in the right place at the right time			1
@entity95 's principal security researcher @entity118 said the theft was unusual as it targeted banks directly , rather than individuals ' bank accounts , and that the hackers seemed to set their limit to around £ 10million before moving onto another bank			1
' in this case they are not interested in information			0
they 're only interested in the money , ' mr @entity118 said			0
' they 're flexible and quite aggressive and use any tool they find useful for doing whatever they want to do			0
' a spokesman for the firm added : ' the @entity139 criminal gang used techniques drawn from the arsenal of targeted attacks			1
the plot marks the beginning of a new stage in the evolution of cyber-criminal activity , where malicious users steal money directly from banks , and avoid targeting end users			2
' the scale of the crime was global , with banks in the @entity106 , @entity14 , @entity11 and @entity107 targeted , and the attackers thought to be expanding throughout @entity156 , the @entity157 and @entity158			0
in one case , an unnamed bank lost $ 7.3million ( around £ 4.7million ) through atm fraud			2
another financial institution lost $ 10million ( around £ 6.5million ) after the attackers exploited its online banking platform			2
@entity95 has not identified the banks hit by the scam , and is still working with law - enforcement agencies to investigate the attacks , which the company says are ongoing			2
losses to @entity3 banks have not yet been disclosed , but are thought to run into tens of millions of pounds			1
however , as the scam targets institutions rather than individuals , customers ' accounts have not been affected			1
despite the fact the fraud has been uncovered , it is feared that banks could be hit again , as once installed the malware can operate almost independently of the gang and is difficult to detect			0
@entity183 , principal security researcher at @entity95 , said : ' it was a very slick and professional cyber-robbery '			0
@entity185 , director of the @entity186 , said : ' these attacks again underline the fact that criminals will exploit any vulnerability in any system			0
' ' scale of the crime was global			0
' the @entity194 and @entity195 , a non-profit organisation that alerts banks about hacking activity , said in a statement that its members received a briefing about the report in january			0
' we can not comment on individual actions our members have taken , but on balance we believe our members are taking appropriate actions to prevent and detect these kinds of attacks and minimize any effects on their customers , ' the organisation said			0
' the report that @entity11 banks were the primary victims of these attacks may be a significant change in targeting strategy by @entity11 - speaking cyber-criminals			0
' @entity106 authorities are putting an increasing focus on cybersecurity in the wake of numerous data breaches of companies ranging from mass retailers like @entity227 and @entity228 to @entity229 and health insurer @entity230			0
the @entity231 wants @entity232 to replace the existing patchwork of state laws with a national standard giving companies 30 days to notify consumers if their personal information has been compromised .			0
