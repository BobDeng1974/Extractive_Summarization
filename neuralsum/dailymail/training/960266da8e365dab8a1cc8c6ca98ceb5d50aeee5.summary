by @entity0 a woman who was hired to trawl online dating portals for thin , white , @entity4 brunettes for a ' successful entrepreneur ' , has opened up about her experience			1
@entity7 , a @entity8 - based writer , scored her unusual job from the man , known only as @entity11 , after he posted a @entity13 ad seeking an ' online dating surrogate '			1
she herself was required to be ' pretty , thin and educated ' , much like the women he was hoping to date			0
' @entity11 's standards for a potential date were strict ' , writes ms @entity7 for @entity20 , remarking that although his feedback on her picks was relatively limited , he did point out the undesirable women who ' just ca n’t squeeze into the slender category			1
' dating surrogate : @entity7 ( pictured ) took on the job of finding slim , smart , ' white ' women online for a mystery ' successful entrepreneur ' who claimed he was too busy to hunt for himself the true identity of @entity11 , who paid ms @entity7 $ 100 a week for roughly seven hours of work , remains hidden			1
but based on her research and the man ’s address , she suspects him to be a married father and the founder of a small @entity38 company			1
ms @entity7 ’s role was to scout @entity40 for suitable women , and five times a week , to send @entity11 a carefully curated @entity42 containing the profile photos of ten women he might like to get in touch with			1
she created a fake profile , ' @entity47 ' to kick off her search , describing her fictional creation as a cringe - inducing ' blonde , athletic , never married , cigar aficionado ' , seeking ' a cook in the kitchen , bro in the bleachers , and freak in the sheets			0
' @entity11 's ad : the mystery man posted this ad ( pictured ) in which he is seeking a ' pretty , thin , educated female in her 20s or 30s ' to manage his online dating life , paying $ 100 a week to her surprise , the fake profile she created for @entity11 attracted women in droves : ' the first day i browsed for hours , marveling at how accomplished , pretty and serene the 30 - something brunettes of @entity8 appeared to be			1
' their careers , their international vacations , their shiny hair			0
i found a formidable army of women and stored them away			0
' ' as unsure as i was about if it was demoralizing to womankind , i was positive it was demoralizing to me ' ms @entity7 , who @entity11 deigned ' had a good eye ' , wrestled with her conscience over leading these women into the potential arms of this ' rich a * * hole ' , as she describes him			1
ultimately however , she decided that these were evidently smart women who could probably ' look after themselves			0
' @entity7 's response : ms @entity7 replied to @entity11 's @entity13 ad with this email ( pictured ) which scored her the job - a role she ultimately found ' demoralizing ' over time , ms @entity7 found herself getting jaded			2
the mystery @entity11 's brash demeanor was clearly rubbing off on her , and in her emails to him , she went from referring to the women as ' nice ladies ' to ' this batch			0
' ms @entity7 's one clue as to the true identity of @entity11 was in the return address on the envelope in which he sent her a check for her work			0
she googled the address and floor number and came across a small company run by three ' smiling founders '			0
one was apparently ' a forty - something man named @entity11 '			0
his short bio read that @entity11 ' valued the happiness of his wife and kids ' , writes ms @entity7 , adding that she still ' could n't be sure ' that he had the right man			1
' i worried about these women and this rich married man , these unequal relationships burdened by his wealth and secrets ' she describes picturing the women she had linked this potentially married man with , writing : ' i saw them on their first date , their second and their third , exchanging little gifts and sharing expensive dinners			2
i worried about these women and this rich married man , these unequal relationships burdened by his wealth and secrets			2
' ms @entity7 never discovers what became of @entity11 's dating endeavors , except for mentioning one woman who was ' for certain ... making herself subject to @entity11 's fortune			2
' ultimately , with her social experiment under her belt , ms @entity7 quit , citing : ' as unsure as i was about if it was demoralizing to womankind , i was positive it was demoralizing to me			0
