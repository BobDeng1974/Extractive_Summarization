the years of upheaval following @entity2 's revolution has had a direct impact on tourism revenues			1
with westerners more cautious about visiting the country due to travel warnings and social unrest , it has meant the likes of the @entity11 and @entity12 have seen a reduced footfall			1
the @entity2 government estimate that revenues have fallen by 95 per cent since the revolution , from £ 250 million in 2010 to just £ 10.5 million for 2014			1
this is leaving the antiquities ministry in a difficult predicament , with job losses a distinct possibility			1
speaking to @entity34 , the editor of the @entity36 , @entity37 , said : ' it 's dead			0
it 's even worse than in 1997 after the massacre of the tourists ' at the @entity43 temple in the @entity44			0
' there are lots of people who have given up working in tourism and are trying to find new work			0
' history : @entity12 , one of the great sights of @entity2 , has seen a reduced football placid : though the @entity26 resorts in @entity2 are holding their own , it 's the other historical areas that are more worrying the financial problems the country is going through was reflected in the july budget , when , with the aim to reducing the deficit by 10 per cent , new austerity measures were brought in			2

however , with so many historical sites , the focus might well turn to how to attract foreigners to the country and give back a much - needed economic boom to the @entity76 country .			0

reduced footfall *recorded* at the likes of the @entity11 and @entity81 's tomb
in four years , revenue stream drops from £ 250 million to just £ 10.5 million
job losses a real possibility in government ministry
