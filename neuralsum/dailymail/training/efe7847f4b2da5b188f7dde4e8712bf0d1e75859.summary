a controversial scheme to pay @entity2 £ 55 for every new case of dementia on their books is leading to patients being wrongly told they may have the devastating illness , researchers warn			1
the initiative was launched by the @entity10 in the autumn to boost shockingly low detection rates and meet ambitious targets			1
leading doctors and campaigners branded it ‘ unethical ’ and warned patients would be wrongly labelled as having dementia			1
now researchers at the @entity19 say there is evidence these concerns have been realised			0
researchers have warned that a controversial scheme to pay gps £ 55 for every new case of dementia on their books is leading to patients being wrongly diagnosed			1
stock photo they have found that the number of ‘ inaccurate ’ referrals by @entity2 to memory clinics – centres to diagnose dementia – has doubled since the scheme was introduced			1
a study of 150 patients found that just over half – 52 per cent – who had been sent to memory clinics for scans since october were later found not to have dementia			1
this compares to rates of between 25 and 30 per cent before the scheme was introduced			2
many had temporary memory problems brought on by depression or old age rather than dementia			0
lead researcher dr @entity47 , consultant neurologist at the @entity19 , said the initiative may be having a ‘ devastating consequence ’ on patients and families			1
the scheme sees practices paid £ 55 for every new case of dementia recorded on their lists by the end of march			0
gps can either make a diagnosis themselves following a series of detailed questions or send patients to memory clinics for scans			0
but neither system is accurate so it follows that as more patients are sent for tests , the higher the chance of more people being misdiagnosed			0
researchers are also concerned that as gps refer more patients to memory clinics , waiting times increase ever further for those who genuinely do have the illness and need treatment			0
dr @entity47 , whose study was uncovered by @entity79 , said : ‘ we already know there are long waiting lists to be seen and if you send more people who do n’t have dementia into those clinics … it slows down the process			1
‘ but also i think there is a risk that if we do n’t analyse patients carefully enough then we are going to give people a false diagnosis			2
’ meanwhile dr @entity93 , a gp in @entity95 , @entity96 , said there was ‘ no way of knowing if doctors have gamed the system ’			1
he added : ‘ consider also that someone might have dementia , but the gp knows the memory clinic wo n’t turn them around before the end of march			2
‘ what would you do in that situation ? tell yourself that ’s bad luck that the memory clinic has such a long waiting list in your area , or code them as dementia now , knowing that after the end of march you can always change the code if the specialist diagnoses something else			2
’ figures show that the number of patients diagnosed with dementia has increased seven-fold since the scheme was introduced			1
there were nearly 35,000 recorded cases in the five months since october 2014 compared to 4,600 between april and september 2014			0
a study of 150 patients found that just over half who had been sent to memory clinics for scans since october were later found not to have dementia			2
stock photo currently , around 850,000 adults in @entity129 have dementia but only 45 per cent have been formally diagnosed with the illness			0
@entity131 say the scheme is only a temporary measure to improve detection rates and will stop after the end of march			1
professor @entity136 , @entity131 's national clinical director for dementia , said : ' high quality , accurate and timely diagnosis of dementia allows people to access the emotional , practical and financial support they need			0
' there is absolutely no evidence to suggest the £ 55 scheme is leading to patients being wrongly diagnosed by @entity2			1
' the small study of patients visiting a memory clinic in @entity149 in 2012/13 was carried out long before the introduction of the temporary £ 55 financial incentive for @entity2 , launched in late 2014			2
' it is highly unlikely a patient would be told they have dementia if the gp was not certain - if there is any doubt , the patient will be referred for a further assessment to determine the diagnosis , as is clearly happening in @entity149			0
' last week it emerged that @entity2 could win bonuses for prescribing fewer antibiotics			0
health bosses fear the drugs are being handed out so freely that they are losing their effectiveness and they claim cash incentives will help curb their use .			0
