@entity0 has declared himself fit for sunday 's @entity2 derby			1
@entity3 has missed @entity5 's last six games following an ankle injury he suffered in the 2 - 1 defeat at @entity8 on february 21			1
manager @entity9 said last week he did not expect the striker to be fit enough to return for sunday 's game against @entity12 at @entity13 , but @entity3 reported good news for @entity5 fans on wednesday			1
@entity0 has declared himself fit for the @entity2 derby after missing @entity5 's last six games @entity9 will be pleased to have @entity3 back but he is unlikely to start the game the 31 - year - old tweeted : ' back to training with the group today			1
@entity23 to be fit and able to play again			0
looking forward to my next game ! ' even if @entity27 considers @entity3 to be fit to take part in the derby , it is hard to see how the former @entity31 front man would fit into the starting @entity32 @entity5 have hardly missed the @entity33 , who has scored just 10 goals this term			1
during his absence , the @entity36 have only lost once - against his former employers @entity31 in the @entity39			0
@entity5 have recorded creditable victories over @entity41 and @entity42 and last saturday they moved above @entity12 into third with a 3 - 1 win over @entity44			1
@entity45 scored a stunning volley during the win			0
the @entity5 skipper has performed well up front in a 4 - 3 - 3 formation alongside @entity51 and @entity52 , who scored both goals in the 2 - 1 win at @entity55 two - and - a - half weeks ago			2
@entity56 has also provided able and robust support from midfield			0
@entity45 celebrates with @entity59 after scoring against @entity44 at the weekend victory for @entity5 this weekend would pile more misery on out - of - form @entity12 and improve @entity27 's chances of achieving his target of @entity65 qualification			1
once he returns from his summer break , he is likely to take @entity5 on a shortened pre-season tour , with the most likely destination the @entity69 , it has emerged			0
@entity27 made no secret of his annoyance at @entity5 's pre-season schedule last summer			2
@entity5 had already committed themselves to a three - week long tour that took in five matches across five @entity69 cities by the time @entity27 took over as manager			2
@entity5 travelled almost 13,500 miles on the trip , which included games in @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 - all against high - profile opposition			2
this summer 's tour is expected to see @entity5 take on fewer opponents and undertake less travel			0
the trip will have to be over a shorter period of time too as the @entity94 season begins on august 8 - just eight weeks after the end of the international break			0
it is understood that @entity27 will sign off plans for the tour in the coming weeks .			0

@entity5 have @entity0 back fit for sunday
the @entity103 striker has been missing since february 21
it is unlikely that @entity3 will make @entity5 's starting *xi* against @entity12
as @entity5 and @entity12 go head - to - head , we ask : just how @entity109 is the derby ?
