@entity0 last night stood by remarks secretly recorded at a campaign fundraising event in which he said that 47 per cent of @entity4 are dependent on government and that ' my job is not to worry about those people			1
' referring to @entity10 supporters , @entity0 said : ' all right , there are 47 per cent who are with him , who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you - name - it			1
' that , that 's an entitlement			0
and the government should give it to them			0
and they will vote for this president no matter what … these are people who pay no income tax			1
' he added that ' my job is not to worry about those people -- i 'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives			0
' scroll down to hear the leaked recording controversy : @entity0 said his plan is to create jobs -- not government dependency -- for the ' 47 per cent ' leaked : @entity50 , a liberal news magazine , says it obtained the footage from an anonymous person who attended the fundraiser blunder : the resulting outcry is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the @entity59 lost the race to the @entity61 @entity0 added to the controversy by referring to his family 's @entity64 heritage and saying if his father @entity67 had been ' born of @entity64 parents , i 'd have a better shot at winning this '			1
he then made a further reference to how voting based on race favours the @entity74 , saying : ' we are having a much harder time with @entity78 voters , and if the @entity78 voting bloc becomes as committed to the @entity74 as the @entity81 voting block has in the past , why , we 're in trouble as a party and , i think , as a nation			1
' in a hastily - arranged evening press conference in @entity86 , @entity0 said that @entity10 believes in ' a government - centred society ' whereas the @entity59 nominee believed in a ' free people , free enterprise , free market ' society and had an approach that would put 23 million people back to work			1
he added that ' my campaign is about helping people take more responsibility ' and ' getting people back to work			2
' @entity0 conceded only that his sentiments were ' not elegantly stated ' because he was ' speaking off the cuff			2
' but it will be difficult for @entity0 to rebut charges that he is contemptuous of almost half the population and has no desire to persuade them or win them over			2
video : @entity0 reacts to the undercover filming from @entity111 the timing of the release of the clip -- 50 days before the election -- could make it even more damaging than the 2008 audio of then - senator @entity10 saying at a 2008 fundraiser that rural voters ' get bitter , they cling to guns or religion '			1
@entity10 made those comments in the april of election year when he was already all but guaranteed to win the @entity74 primaries			2
he then had seven months in which to overcome them			0
the @entity10 campaign was quick to exploit the potential political bombshell of the @entity59 nominee effectively writing off almost half the country			1
facts : @entity0 has statistics on his side when it comes to the 47 per cent comment - only 53 per cent of @entity4 pay federal income tax after deductions and rebates in a statement reacting to the secret recordings , @entity140 , @entity10 's campaign manager , said : ' it 's shocking that a candidate for @entity145 would go behind closed doors and declare to a group of wealthy donors that half the @entity81 people view themselves as " victims " entitled to handouts , and are unwilling to take " personal responsibility " for their lives			1
' it ’s hard to serve as president for all @entity4 when you ’ve disdainfully written off half the nation			1
' in an initial attempt at damage limitation , @entity158 , @entity0 ’s communications director , said in a statement : ‘ @entity0 wants to help all @entity4 struggling in the @entity10 economy			2
the campaign did not dispute the authenticity of the clip			0
gracious host : hedge fund manage @entity168 threw the $ 50,000 - a - plate fundraiser where @entity0 made the comments ‘ as the governor has made clear all year , he is concerned about the growing number of people who are dependent on the federal government , including the record number of people who are on food stamps , nearly one in six @entity4 in poverty , and the 23 million @entity4 who are struggling to find work			2
@entity0 's plan creates 12 million new jobs in four years , grows the economy and moves @entity4 off of government dependency and into jobs			1
’ the videos , posted on @entity187 , were obtained by @entity50 , a left - wing magazine			0
@entity0 's 47 per cent figure seems to have come from a @entity190 report that found 46.4 per cent of @entity81 households paid zero income taxes or received a net refund from the government			1
this leaves 53.6 per cent of households shouldering the nation 's entire tax burden			2
when the report was released , some @entity59 took up a rallying cry of ' the other 53 per cent ' -- a response to the @entity201 's ' the other 99 per cent ' slogan			2
the startling figure is the result of a number of tax loopholes -- mostly credits given to the elderly and the poor			2
but @entity0 appeared to mix up the 47 per cent of people who did not pay income tax -- many of whom pay state and local taxes and payroll taxes -- with the proportion of core @entity10 supporters			1
many of of those who do n't pay income tax are @entity59 supporters -- particularly working class white men and the elderly			1
according to @entity224 , who wrote the @entity50 article , the video was filmed at a $ 50,000 - per - plate fundraiser thrown by hedge fund manager @entity168			0
battered : the @entity10 campaign quickly jumped on the statement saying @entity0 ' disdained ' half of the nation no responsibility : @entity0 claimed he could never convince @entity10 supporters to ' take responsibility for their lives ' the @entity235 reported last year that @entity168 , worth an estimated $ 400million , threw an end - of - summer bash in the @entity237 last year where ' guests cavorted nude in a pool and performed sex acts , while scantily clad @entity243 women danced on platforms			1
dancers at the party also twirled flaming torches to booming beats			0
' the may fundraiser in @entity250 was part of a two - day sweep through @entity253 that netted @entity0 $ 10million in two days			0
@entity255 campaign chairwoman @entity254 told the @entity256 at the time that the fundraiser was a success			0
' he really ad libbed a lot , ' she said			0
' he 's loosening up so much more each time i see him			0
' @entity264 ’s @entity263 reported that former president @entity266 ’s grandson helped unearth the footage			1
@entity268 is credited as a research assistant on the @entity50 piece that broke the story			0
@entity266 spends much of his time searching for video clips of @entity59			2
once he discovered the video on @entity187 , he put the owner of it in contact with @entity50 , who he has worked with before			0
@entity280 's @entity279 writes that the comments reveal @entity0 is a true conservative			2
' @entity0 's condemnation of @entity4 's entitlement society -- and his assessment that @entity10 voters are part of the problem -- fit firmly into contemporary movement conservatism , and seem to demonstrate an internalization of the @entity59 narrative about meritocratic success , ' the @entity280 article says			1
standing by his words : at a press conference on monday , @entity0 said his remarks were ' not elegantly stated , ' but did not back away from the message in the tapes , @entity0 also referred to his family heritage in @entity64 and joked that if his father @entity67 had been ' born of @entity64 parents , i 'd have a better shot at winning this '			1
the tape emerged as the @entity59 nominee spoke at @entity307 in @entity308 in a bid to erode the strong advantage among @entity311 enjoyed by president @entity10			1
but in comments very different from those to the @entity307 , @entity0 told wealthy voters at an event that has not been identified by the anonymous film maker , @entity0 made light of the problem he has attracting @entity78 voters			1
' my dad , as you probably know , was the governor of @entity322 and was the head of a car company , ' he said			0
' but he was born in @entity64 ... and uh , had he been born of uh , @entity64 parents , i 'd have a better shot at winning this			0
but he was unfortunately born to @entity4 living in @entity64			0
he lived there for a number of years			0
i mean , i say that jokingly , but it would be helpful to be @entity78			0
' at the same event , he dismissed @entity10 voters as freeloaders who pay no taxes , do n't take responsibility for their own lives and who expect government to take care of them			1
talking about his wealth , @entity0 said : ' i have inherited nothing			0
there is a perception , " oh , we were born with a silver spoon , he never had to earn anything " and so forth			0
frankly , i was born with a silver spoon , which is the greatest gift you can have : which is to get born in @entity4			0
' @entity0 told the donors that ' women are open to supporting me ' but that ' we are having a much harder time with @entity78 voters , and if the @entity78 voting bloc becomes as committed to the @entity74 as the @entity81 voting block has in the past , why , we 're in trouble as a party and , i think , as a nation '			1
when one contributor asked how those present could help @entity0 sell himself to others , he replied : ' frankly , what i need you to do is to raise millions of dollars			0
