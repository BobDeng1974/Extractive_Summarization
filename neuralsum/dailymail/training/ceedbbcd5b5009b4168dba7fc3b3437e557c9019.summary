by @entity0 published : 05:46 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 06:16 est , 2 september 2013 the curiosity rover has turned its cameras on @entity4 ' moon , @entity5 , to capture the most detailed image of any @entity4 lunar transit ever taken			1
the larger of @entity4 ’ two moons , @entity5 , passed directly in front of the sun on the 369th @entity4 day of @entity1 's work on the planet			1
@entity5 does not fully cover the sun , as seen from the surface of @entity4 , so the solar eclipse is what ’s called a ring , or annular , type			1
the rover 's observations of @entity5 will help make researchers ' knowledge of the moon 's orbit even more precise			2
because the eclipse occurred near mid-day at @entity1 's location on @entity4 , @entity5 was nearly overhead , closer to the rover than it would have been earlier in the morning or later in the afternoon			1
this timing made @entity5 ' silhouette larger against the sun - as close to a total eclipse of the sun as is possible from @entity4			2
‘ this event occurred near noon at @entity1 's location , which put @entity5 at its closest point to the rover , appearing larger against the sun than it would at other times of day , ’ said @entity50 a co-investigator for use of @entity1 's @entity52			1
@entity61 's @entity60 project is using @entity1 ( a computer - generated illustration is pictured ) landed on @entity4 in august last year for a two - year mission to determine if the planet most like @entity65 in the solar system has , or ever had , the an environment to sustain life according to the @entity61 , the position of @entity5 crossing the sun was a mile or two closer to the centre of the sun 's position than researchers anticipated			1
@entity5 has a diameter of less than one per cent of the @entity65 's moon and it orbits much closer to @entity4 than our moon 's distance from @entity65			1
the larger of @entity4 ' moons measures just 22km in diameter but orbits just 3,700 miles from @entity4 ' surface			0
@entity5 is the larger of @entity4 ' two moons and just 22km in diameter but orbits just 3,700 miles from @entity4 ' surface			2
it is so close to the planet 's surface that in some locations on @entity4 it can not always be seen			0
@entity5 is nearing @entity4 at a rate of 1.8 m every hundred years ; at that rate , it will either crash into @entity4 in 50 million years or break up into a ring			0
its most prominent feature is the 6 - mile crater @entity95 , its impact causing streak patterns across the moon 's surface			0
when viewed from the surface of @entity4 , @entity5 looks about half as wide the @entity65 's moon appears to viewers on @entity65 , according to the scientists			2
the @entity65 's moon is vast compared to the @entity4 moons , with a diameter of around 2,160 miles but orbits much further away from it 's planet 's surface at an average of 239,000 miles			0
the rover landed on @entity4 in august last year for a two - year mission to determine if the planet most like @entity65 in the solar system has , or ever had , the an environment to sustain life			0
curiosity is now trundling along to its final destination - @entity118 - where it will look at the lower layers of the mountain that towers over the centre of @entity123 by almost three and a half miles			0
@entity118 is of interest to scientists because its layers of rock can reveal information about the planet 's changing environment over time			0
last month , @entity1 captured the eclipse of the moons - @entity24 - for the first time from @entity4			0
the larger moon , @entity5 , passed in front of @entity137 in the 30 - second video comprised of 41 images taken by the robotic vehicle that were stitched together by scientists working at @entity61 's @entity142 .			1

@entity5 passed directly in front of the sun on @entity1 's 369th @entity4 day
images were taken three seconds apart with the rover ’s telephoto lens
position of moon was a mile or two closer to the sun than originally thought
