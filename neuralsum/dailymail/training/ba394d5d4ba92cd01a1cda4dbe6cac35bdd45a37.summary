by @entity0 published : 17:21 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 19:53 est , 15 february 2013 she already had the name of her idol			2
and before she was 16 , @entity4 had the figure to match – thanks to plastic surgery paid for by her mother			1
and , as in any family , what she had , her younger sister @entity9 wanted too			1
@entity9 and @entity4 ’s mother @entity12 has now spent almost £ 20,000 on cosmetic surgery for her daughters			1
the result ? both now wish they had n’t gone under the knife when they were so young – because their artificially enhanced bottoms and breasts attract too much attention			1
the @entity24 sisters have had seven procedures between them to look like @entity4 's namesake the sisters ' mother @entity12 has spent almost £ 20,000 on plastic surgery for them to emulate the curves of pop star @entity4 @entity9 , 20 , said : ‘ my bum is so big now it ’s kind of a curse because guys in clubs always want to have a feel of it			1
even girls want a photo next to it			2
my body attracts everyone – i get too much attention and it annoys me			0
’ her sister , @entity4 , 23 , who has a young son , added : ‘ sometimes it ’s too much			1
men beep their horns and whistle at me , even come up and touch my bum			0
' i also get a lot of attention from women			0
they ask me if my bum is real and if they can touch it			0
’ @entity4 was the first to have surgery – a £ 4,000 breast enlargement operation to increase her cup size from a to c when she was just 15			2
she later had a second , £ 6,000 operation , which involved having liposuction on her stomach			0
the fat was then pumped into her bottom			0
@entity4 , a size 12 , said : ‘ i envied curvy women like [ @entity65 pop star ] @entity4 when i asked for the surgery , [ mum ] said no at first and that i should wait until i was 18 , when my curves might develop			2
‘ but i wanted the results straight away			0
i kept on asking every day , saying how unhappy i was until , a year later , she agreed			0
’ as they were : @entity4 , left , and @entity9 , far right , with their mother @entity12 and an unidentified friend @entity9 , a size eight , started even younger			1
she had a £ 2,000 nose job at 14 and a breast enhancement , which also cost £ 2,000 , a year later			0
she eventually persuaded her 43 - year - old mother to use her savings and money earned through a cleaning job to pay for a £ 3,500 liposuction and bottom enlargement operation like @entity4 ’s			2
the sisters had most of their surgery in @entity87 , where their parents migrated from shortly before @entity9 was born			1
they now live in @entity89 , @entity90			1
the @entity24 sisters admired the @entity65 singer 's curves , seen in 2002 , left , and at the @entity94 last week in the @entity97 , the legal age of consent for cosmetic surgery is 16 , but most reputable surgeons wo n’t operate until 18			1
@entity4 , who has had further liposuction on her stomach and a second £ 2,000 breast enlargement after discovering she had faulty @entity103 implants , said : ‘ after my surgery i had the body of a woman , but in reality i was still only a child			2
‘ there are so many perfect images of celebrities , it ’s hard not to feel the pressure			0
but if you have the money and it makes you happy , why not do it ? life ’s too short to feel unhappy			0

@entity24 sisters @entity9 , 20 , and @entity4 , 23 , from @entity89 , south @entity90 , say they wish they had *n't* gone under the knife so young
