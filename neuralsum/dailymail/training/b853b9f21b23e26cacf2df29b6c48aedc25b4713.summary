@entity78 went on to become king of @entity85 , while his brother @entity86 was the first king of @entity71			0
a letter dated july 10 1917 , which provides an insight both into @entity26 ’s style and the type of war he was waging , read : ' i ’m just back from a stunt with @entity94 : we had to go 32 miles to the railway without water & of course return at once			1
we broke 450 rails on 6th night 7th morning at kilo 1027 , just n. of @entity100			0
a film still from @entity7 starring @entity15 ' @entity102 has now gone to a well we dug in @entity103 , nearer the railway & should destroy 3 to 400 rails more or less nightly			0

reflecting on those times in his autobiography @entity109 , @entity41 , who was an intelligence officer with the rank of captain at the time , wrote of his friend and colleague : ' @entity26 had constant difficulties from his excess of zeal , and his habitual doing four times what any other @entity120 would do , and ten times what the @entity6 thought needful or wise			1
@entity26 is like fire ... he burns friend and enemy			2
' according to @entity41 , @entity26 wore out prince @entity78 ’s best camels with his constant to - ing and fro - ing. a letter written to @entity41 by @entity26 but never sent shows the closeness between the two men			1
it read : ' i ’ve always regretted just having missed you when you first went to @entity135 ’s and again early in may : and it made a great difference to my shows not having you with @entity78 to back me up and buck him up			0

we others ca n’t disguise the fact that we are @entity14 & its no use trying to be unnaturally @entity6 when one ca n’t : and i ’ve not succeeded			0

he said : ' we do not know why the correspondence praising @entity41 was not dispatched by @entity26			1
' he could have thought better of it			0
but they would have been moving around the whole time and it may just be he never got around to it			0
but for whatever reason , @entity41 never actually saw it			2
' mr @entity106 said the auction is expected to attract bids from @entity14 and overseas collectors because @entity41 was such an important figure , as well as museums eager to get their hands on the material			2
but the death of @entity15 who shot to fame playing him in the 1962 @entity169 winning movie @entity7 was unlikely to attract additional interest			0
