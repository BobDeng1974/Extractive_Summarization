one the most famous @entity1 videos comes long before his goal against @entity3 handed @entity4 their first major trophy in the modern era and long before those @entity8 compilations of him turning @entity10 inside out as @entity11 got the better of @entity12 on a regular basis			1
one of the most famous @entity1 clips is of him jumping up and down as a teenage ball boy singing the ‘ ole ole ole cholo @entity18 ’ terrace song with his pals at the @entity21			1
@entity1 idolised @entity18 , the captain of the best @entity23 side until last year ’s team that won the league			1
he has always been reluctant to go home but with the @entity28 in charge that has changed			0
if anyone can put his career back on track it is ' @entity34 '			0
@entity18 ( right ) and @entity1 ( left ) played together at @entity23 between 2003 and 2005 @entity1 ( top row , second left ) was @entity18 's captain ( top row , far left ) during his first spell at @entity23 @entity1 tweeted his excitement to be back at the club where he made his name as a teenager @entity1 claims he does not regret his time at @entity44 , but his goalscoring record since joining for £ 50million in january 2011 does not look good : @entity46 : 20 goals in 110 games @entity49 : 7 goals in 19 games @entity53 competitions : 19 goals in 43 games total : 46 goals in 172 games @entity1 earned a move to the @entity46 after impressing for @entity23			1
the @entity59 scored 84 league goals in 214 games for his boyhood side before sealing a £ 20million switch to @entity11			1
@entity23 will get @entity1 as fit as he has been for years with famed fitness coach ‘ @entity65 ’ working on giving him back that burst of acceleration that he has lacked in recent seasons			1
he will not feel too much pressure because @entity23 have @entity71 scoring goals and comfortably filling the gap left by @entity73			0
@entity1 does not go to his old club as the saviour			2
the expectations will not be as high as they were at @entity11 , @entity44 and @entity77			2
he is expected to fill the role vacated by his old @entity4 strike partner @entity79 last season			0
but the secondary role will not mean he is moving out of the limelight			0
@entity23 are very much in the title race and they have two massive cup games coming up in january against @entity86 - local derbies in which @entity1 may well start because the competition is @entity23 ’s third priority this season			1
the @entity90 striker came through at @entity23 as a teenager , becoming captain at the age of just 19 @entity23 : @entity94 @entity44 : @entity95 2012 , @entity96 2012 , @entity97 2013 @entity4 : @entity98 2008 , @entity99 , 2010 @entity100 @entity1 has opened two gymnasiums in @entity4 recently			2
both are being overseen by a close friend and business partner but now back in @entity4 he can be far more hands on with a venture he is hoping to expand after retirement			0
and before retirement he can bring his career full circle , playing in front of fans who have always adored him and never held it against him that he left for @entity11 he will be happy again			0
the @entity21 has n’t changed much since he left the club ; @entity115 are still waiting to move into a new and as yet unfinished out - of - town stadium ; the team still plays in the famous red - and - white shirt ; and @entity18 is still the leader - albeit having changed the captain ’s armband for the manager ’s dugout			1
no wonder @entity1 has been texting about how happy he is to be home			0
@entity1 will be hoping the move back to his first club will help him return to his deadliest form @entity1 lifts the @entity100 with @entity4 in 2010 , but has since fallen out of favour with the national team			2

@entity1 has joined @entity23 on loan from @entity77
@entity1 returns to the @entity21 seven - and - a - half years after leaving boyhood club to join @entity11
the @entity59 will work under idol and former team - mate @entity18
@entity138 : @entity139 will get back to his best under @entity18
