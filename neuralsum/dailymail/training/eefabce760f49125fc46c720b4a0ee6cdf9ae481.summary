@entity2 , 45 , is accused of breaking the terms of her order and will answer to magistrates on april 14 , just two weeks after she was was fined for berating @entity16 , 64 , for buying the wrong type of scratch card			1
as this would be her third time breaking the conditions of her asbo , which bans her from making noises loud enough to disturb neighbours of her terraced house in @entity26 , @entity27 , the warehouse worker could face up to 26 weeks in jail			1
in a recording of the latest rant , obtained by @entity33 , mrs @entity30 can be heard shouting : ' give the bath a clean			2
why should i have to do it ? i drew a bath for you			2
' get that @entity39 and give the bath a clean			2
no , not that one ... get the door shut ... shut the door ... i keep saying , shut the door ... you have to shut the door ... come out and shut that door ... for @entity49 ’s sake what you doing ? ' the tirade did not stop there , however			0
popping outside for a cigarette , she continued to yell back into the house : ' you mind if i have a bath once a week ... because you ’ve got no hygiene sense			0
i have a bath every day			0
i said you ’re washed then ? there ’s no water running			0
' mrs @entity2 appeared before @entity60 on tuesday and was ordered to pay £ 270 after a blistering 45 - minute rant at her husband for buying the wrong type of scratch card			1
@entity65 have been complaining about her outbursts since 1999 , and it was around thirteen years before she received her asbo in december 2012			1
she was also dragged into court after a noisy argument last year			0
@entity30 , pictured in 2012 around the time of her asbo being issued , was fined on tuesday for breaching order night - shift worker @entity2 was originally handed a five - year @entity68 in december 2012 after noise monitoring equipment was installed to measure the volume of her shouting			1
the ruling prohibits her from creating noise audible to neighbouring properties , shouting , screaming or banging on internal doors and communicating with certain neighbours			0
but she breached it just four months later it was imposed when she argued with @entity16 last april			1
@entity83 , defending her at her court appearance earlier this week , said : ' the circumstances are that @entity2 lives in a terrace with her husband of 25 years			1
unlucky neighbours : people have been complaining about the noise @entity30 made since 1999 ' she has an asbo but during this day in particular , there is an argument at the address and it ’s as simple as that			0
' there is no intention by this lady to encroach on the neighbours , she confined the argument to the house , she was not out on the streets , but the neighbours could hear it			0
' her husband said he slammed the door when he left the room and that was not her			2
@entity2 admitted the offence and accepts what she has done			1
' she has lived at the address for 26 years and it is only quite recently that these issues have been reported			0
this is a lady who wants to get on with her life and keep herself to herself , but there is going to be some escape of noise in relation to her neighbours			0
' magistrates told @entity2 that breaching an asbo was a serious offence but agreed to be lenient on this occasion			1
she was fined £ 165 and ordered to pay £ 105 in court costs			2
she must also attend anger management classes			0
@entity30 , who was escorted from court by two police officers , refused to comment after the hearing			0
@entity2 's rants will be nothing new to her long - suffering neighbours , who have been complaining about her for more than a decade			1
she was first given a noise abatement order in 1999 , and was fined £ 500 for a breach which was recorded in 2010			1
over the next two years the situation became especially dire , and the local council eventually installed noise monitoring equipment in 2012			2
between july and october of that year , @entity2 breached her noise abatement order an incredible 47 times			1
@entity65 revealed that she has been banned from family events thanks to her short temper			2
after receiving her asbo in december 2012 , it was just four months until she was back in court for breaching the order			1
she was then fined £ 750 and ordered to pay costs of £ 85			2
irate neighbours eventually revealed the contents of her furious rants , in which she orders the long - suffering @entity16 out of the house			1
in one from the morning of august 27 2012 , she can be heard shouting : ' get out if you want a fag			2
go ! you ’re not smoking in bed , i said get out if you want a fag ! get out if you want a fag ! get your shoes on and get out if you want a fag			0
’ @entity2 then continues her rant , screeching : ‘ not gone yet , ca n’t hear the door , get your shoes on and get out , otherwise you ’ll know about it			1
get out , do i have to say it again			0
’ in another she tell her husband : ' do n't worry @entity16 , i 'm just about sick of you ! ' further clips show she is aware of being recorded , but continues regardless			1
