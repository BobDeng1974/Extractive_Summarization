by @entity0 published : 19:22 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 19:22 est , 11 december 2013 every time @entity1 manages to deport a foreign prisoner another one takes their place in jail - at an annual cost to the public of more than £ 300million			1
the government ’s spending watchdog found that , despite repeated promises by ministers to fix the mess , human rights laws and other problems were still leading to huge delays in booting out overseas offenders			1
in almost four in every ten cases studied by the @entity20 , there was no prospect of imminent removal			0
the number of overseas offenders in the @entity1 's prison system still hovers at the 11,000 mark ( stock image ) the result is that @entity1 ’s jails are clogged with 11,000 foreign criminals			1
and as soon as the @entity31 does manage to kick somebody out , there is another immigrant convicted of a crime and sent to jail to take their place			1
the annual bill for housing them in the packed prison estate is £ 308million			1
overall , the total number of all foreign criminals removed by the @entity31 – which includes ex-inmates or people given a community sentence – has fallen by 14 per cent over the past four years			1
in the final three months of 2009 , 5,528 were removed , compared to 4,730 between april and june of this year			2
the @entity20 blamed ‘ complex human rights issues ’ for the failure to remove foreign prisoners			0
keeping the foreign prisoners locked up in @entity1 costs £ 308million every year ( stock image ) other factors included criminals hiding their true identities , @entity54 free movement diktats and delays in getting travel documents			1
the report states : ‘ removals and new convictions are currently roughly equal to one another , meaning that the overall number of foreign national prisoners remains stable			1
‘ but removing more prisoners , or removing them earlier in their sentences , would significantly reduce costs			2
the cost of keeping 1,000 prisoners in prison is £ 28 million a year			1
’ officials found that , in some cases , the @entity31 was guilty of wasting time and public money			1
in one example , poor record keeping meant efforts were made to deport someone who had not been sentenced for a criminal offence and had earlier been granted asylum			0
officials also pursue cases on the basis of when an offenders sentence is due to be concluded – rather than targeting those most likely to be removed			0
the watchdog found instances where the @entity31 wasted time and public money ( stock image ) the @entity20 found that officials had a realistic chance of deporting a criminal within three months of their release date in only two per cent of cases			1
the report said the @entity31 should prioritise cases better			2
@entity1 ’s jails contain inmates from around 150 countries - three out of every four nations in the world			2
@entity99 hailed a transfer agreement with @entity54 countries designed to send more home			0
ministers have been trying for years to find new ways of booting out foreign criminals			0
under @entity106 , they included offering bribes of up to £ 1,500 each to any inmate who leaves voluntarily			0
in 2010 , @entity99 promised to ‘ intervene personally ’ to fix the shambles			0
the prime minister hailed a transfer agreement with @entity54 countries designed to send inmates home to serve their sentence			0
but , during the first year of operation , not a single inmate was removed			0
the two countries with the most inmates in @entity1 – @entity119 and @entity120 – were given opt - outs by the previous @entity106 government			2
earlier this year , mr @entity99 announced @entity1 taxpayers are to fund a major prison building programme in poor countries such as @entity125 and @entity126 foreign criminals have been blamed for the overcrowding problems in our jails			1
last friday , the prison population was 85,429 , with capacity at 85,938 , leaving just 509 spare places			0
labour justice spokesman @entity134 said : ‘ latest @entity136 figures show there are just 509 prison spaces left in @entity139 and @entity140 , with the system operating at over 99 % of capacity			2
‘ things are so bad that police stations and court cells might have to be used			0
public confidence in our justice system will be massively damaged if there ’s not enough space in prisons to lock up criminals			0

the number of overseas offenders in the @entity1 's prison system at 11,000
keeping the prisoners locked up in @entity1 costs £ 308million every year
