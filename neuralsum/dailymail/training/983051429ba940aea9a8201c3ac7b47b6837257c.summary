wilderness : the plane crashed about 115 miles south east of @entity6 's capital @entity145 like a zombie movie : @entity26 said the bright fuselage of the plane shined brightly , nestled amongst the stark blackness of the sand all around it , like something from a zombie movie ' the bright fuselage of the @entity8 @entity1 plane shined brightly , nestled amongst the stark blackness of the sand all around it , like something from a zombie movie			1
