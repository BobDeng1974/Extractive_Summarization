the @entity1 ’s opening game will take place on thursday without a proper test event that would meet @entity5 legislation requirements at the newly - erected @entity6			1
a junior game was held at the 61,000 - seater ground on sunday but the local fire department ’s refusal to approve the temporary seating area that accounts for around 20,000 seats meant nobody could sit in that part of the ground			1
on monday night @entity16 were still preparing a statement on the situation but it is true that special machinery has been used to test the strength of the stand			2
ready ? the @entity6 stadium will host the opening game of the @entity1 not long to go : a junior game was held at the stadium on sunday working : with just two days to go before the @entity1 kicks off , @entity27 is racing to get its stadiums ready @entity30 , however , that is representative of 20,000 football supporters at a match between hosts @entity27 and @entity34 remains to be seen			1
the tests the stadium has so far been subjected to certainly do n’t meet standards in the @entity5			2
@entity5 stadia are governed by ‘ @entity39 ’ , which is a range of legislation that forms the granting of a licence			2
@entity45 to the process , say stadia experts in the @entity5 , is ‘ the testing of stadia life safety systems ’			0
early stages : two people were killed by a collapsed crane during the stadium 's construction that involves holding an ‘ appropriate number ’ of test events with recommendations that they should be undertaken at 30 per cent capacity , 60 per cent capacity and a test event at or around 100 per cent			1
even with temporary seating the strict rules apply			0
during the construction of the @entity6 two people were killed when a crane collapsed onto the roof			1
workmen were still racing to finish the stadium on monday , although it appeared to be little more than finishing touches			0
the @entity6 staged four test events at different capacities			0
the test events mainly serve to evaluate flows and test services for the spectators and the match operation			0
the license to operate the @entity76 matches at the @entity6 as well as the safety and security licenses are due to be published tomorrow in line with standard @entity81 procedures			0
@entity16 and the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) rely on the urban mobility planning presented by host city @entity6 , which includes not only the usual means of transportation but also contingency plans in case of one of the modals is unavailable or partially working			2
what @entity16 and the @entity82 always stress is the importance of fans to plan their way to the stadium and leave early for the match , what avoids arriving too close to kick - off and allow them to enjoy all the attractions offered at the stadium , which on 12 june will also include the opening ceremony , at 15.15			0
