‘ putting two and two together the cats are coming into the garden and eating the birds			1
there are about ten cats coming in total			1

’ he continued : ‘ usually there is about one bird a month killed in the garden but this month there have been three			1
‘ i decided to write the leaflet and put it through the letter box of 108 doors in the area			2
i spoke to one person whilst i was doing it and he did n’t seem to have a problem with it			0
‘ but now i ’ve heard that it ’s all kicking off on @entity67 and one person is threatening to firebomb my house			0
’ he has since defended his actions , saying he thought it was entirely possible for people to control their cats and if not he is planning on buying something that will scare them away			2
‘ if my dog was going around doing this all hell would break loose , ’ he said			0
‘ there are things people can do - if they attach bells to them the birds can hear them coming for example			2
‘ this could now push me out of my house			0
i ’m about to retire and i want to be able to enjoy my garden			0
’ ‘ i am now planning on getting something from @entity88 , i wo n’t disclose what , which will scare them away			0

‘ one of the cats is my son ’s and he got really upset when he saw the letter			2
‘ we all got leaflets through the door , it ’s all over @entity67 - it really has upset a lot of people			2
‘ if he does n’t like cats in his garden there are things he could do about it			2
he could just spray them , or set up sprinklers			0
it ’s harmless and it means they wo n’t come back			0
‘ my neighbour thought about taking the leaflet to the local police station , i ’m not sure if he has yet			0
if they do n’t take it to the police i ’d happily do it myself			0

my cat is actually pictured on the front of the leaflet			0
‘ i think the whole thing is a bit like @entity178 for cats , it all seems very petty			0
‘ i was actually really concerned when i read the bit about him taking “ drastic action ” against the cats			1
‘ i do n’t know what it could be but it certainly sounds very worrying - i ’m sure the @entity186 would be interested to hear about it			0
‘ i have n’t bothered confronting him because i do n’t want to cause a big argument but i know he has upset a lot of people			0
