warning : former attorney general @entity0 claims the atrocities in @entity2 should be a warning that leaving @entity4 would be a disaster for @entity5 sacked @entity6 cabinet minister @entity0 said yesterday that it would be a disaster if @entity5 walked out of the @entity4 human rights court			1
mr @entity0 said the barbaric slaughter in northern @entity2 showed the importance of sticking to human rights rules			2
the former attorney general was removed from office in @entity16 ’s reshuffle last month , amid speculation that a clear - out of @entity20 europhiles is meant to pave the way for repeal of the @entity23 and a @entity5 rebellion against the demands of the @entity4 human rights court			1
mr @entity0 has consistently maintained that @entity5 must stick to its legal obligations to obey the rulings of the @entity29 - based court , and that to fail to do so would encourage aggressive and violent behaviour by countries on the fringes of @entity4			1
he spoke in the aftermath of the @entity29 ruling on tuesday in which @entity4 judges removed the threat to @entity5 taxpayers of millions of pounds of compensation payments to prisoners who have been denied the vote			1
in a test case the human rights court said @entity5 is wrong to deny the vote to convicted prisoners , but it refused to pay 10 @entity47 prisoners either compensation or costs to pay their lawyers ’ bills			1
‘ there are suggestions that my own party wants in some way to enact legislation if we get into government to prevent the court 's judgments being implemented unless the @entity61 approves it , ’ mr @entity0 said on the @entity51			2
‘ that would be , in my view , a disaster			0
’ he added : ‘ it would put us in breach of our international legal obligations , would place us in great difficulty in terms of our international standing on human rights			1
‘ and one only has to look at what is going on at the moment in northern @entity2 to see that human rights do matter			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s line that by sticking to @entity29 law @entity5 can keep rogue countries in order has been provoking frustration among eurosceptics , who say that @entity83 is a member of the @entity85 , yet it does not seem to be respecting international law			1
his @entity6 critics also believe many @entity29 judgements are politically motivated and intended to underline the superior powers of the human rights judges			0
the former attorney general said that rather than quitting the court , ‘ we ought to be acting prudently and moderately in trying to get the changes we want			1
’ the refusal to give compensation to prisoners denied the vote was ‘ a hopeful sign ’ that its judges have been listening to @entity5 opinion			1
‘ my view is that we need to have a robust dialogue with the court and i think we have been trying to have that , ’ he said			0
‘ our own judiciary have been saying quite clearly that they think there are areas where the court is not as good as it should be			0
the danger for the @entity5 is that if we engage in sabre - rattling with the court , i do n't think it will be constructive			1
‘ i think we are in danger of making a very serious mistake , one that would be reputationally very damaging to the @entity6 in any future government			0
danger : he warns that by leaving the @entity85 , @entity5 could be in danger of breaching our international legal obligations			1
he claims sabre - rattling with the court will not be constructive ' there are other ways forward			2
the danger is if one gets carried away with one 's own rhetoric , one can do a lot of damage to the country			0
because ultimately this country is founded on the rule of law			0
’ senior @entity132 have indicated that the party is preparing to repeal the @entity23 and produce a @entity5 @entity134 in place of it			2
a @entity5 rights charter would strain the relationship with the @entity29 court , with its parent body the @entity141 , and with the @entity142			2
yesterday it was disclosed that home secretary @entity144 has advised mr @entity16 that @entity5 must withdraw from the @entity145 which the @entity29 court exists to enforce , and sources close to justice secretary @entity147 said that @entity148 ’s @entity23 , which makes @entity4 rights part of @entity5 law , will be repealed if the @entity132 win next year ’s election			2
eurosceptic @entity6 mps said that @entity29 had pulled back from trying to force compensation payments for prisoners because of the growing fear in @entity4 that @entity5 will pull out			1
@entity158 mp @entity157 said : ‘ this was a rare outbreak of common sense from this federalist court			0
it is amazing what you achieve when you threaten to quit			0
’ mp @entity166 from the @entity169 @entity168 party said : ‘ the prisoner ruling was a politically considered move			0
‘ the @entity85 needs to be accountable			2
at the moment , on something like prisoner voting , they just go off on one			0
' they should be subject to democratic accountability from the parliament of the @entity141			0

move would ' put us in breach of international legal obligations , ' @entity0 said
former attorney general was removed from @entity20 in ' europhile clean - out '
his words came after @entity85 saved @entity5 taxpayers from threat of paying millions of pounds in compensation to 10 prisoners denied the vote
