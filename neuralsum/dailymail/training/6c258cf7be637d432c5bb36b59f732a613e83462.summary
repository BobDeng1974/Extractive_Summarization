by @entity0 published : 07:32 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 11:37 est , 29 january 2014 a cystic fibrosis sufferer has beaten the odds to become a personal trainer			1
@entity5 , 22 , has overcome the debilitating illness to realise her dream of working in fitness			1
she believes pushing herself physically has helped her manage her cystic fibrosis			0
@entity5 ( right ) overcame cystic fibrosis to set up a personal training business with sister , @entity12 ( left ) the condition can cause major lung damage and digestive problems , with the average life expectancy for sufferers being just 40 years			1
ms @entity5 ’ current fitness is a huge turn around as just three years ago she spent three weeks in hospital critically ill after her lung capacity dropped to 60 per cent			1
against the odds she pulled through , but her near death experience made her realise she needed to take her health more seriously			1
‘ lying in a hospital bed with an intravenous line in my arm feeding me antibiotics , i made a vow to myself to make my health a priority , ’ she said			1
‘ seeing my health deteriorate so quickly was frightening to me			2
i knew i had to do something to make sure i was never ill like this again			2
’ in the days and weeks that followed she researched ways to combine her health with her job , and decided to become a personal trainer			1
ms @entity5 made the decision to become a personal trainer when she was in hospital seriously ill. she says her illness , which was caused by cystic fibrosis , made her realise she needed to start putting her health first ms @entity5 said : ' lying in a hospital bed with an intravenous line in my arm feeding me antibiotics , i made a vow to myself to make my health a priority ' she said : ‘ i thought that being a personal trainer would be a great way to make my health my life			1
‘ it would be my job to look after my health , so i would n’t have any excuses to not take care of myself			2
’ cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus			0
symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough , recurring chest infections and failure to thrive			0
as the condition develops , a lung transplant may be required			2
there is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long - term damage caused by infections			2
the most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs , and antibiotics to treat the infections			0
the condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build - up of mucus			2
for a child to inherit the condition , both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene			0
in this situation , there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes , a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer , and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition			0
about one in every 2,500 babies born in the @entity111 are born with cystic fibrosis			0
as treatments have improved , the outlook for these children has improved dramatically			0
life expectancy remains in the 40s			0

amazingly , @entity12 quit her job at a children ’s nursery to help her sister reach her goal			1
' she was my best friend and i knew i ’d find it hard with my illness , ’ says ms @entity5			1
‘ i thought having @entity12 ’s support would spur me on			1
i knew there was no turning back when she said let ’s do it together			0
’ together the sisters trained to become personal trainers with @entity136 , and now they run their own business , @entity138 based @entity5 sisters @entity139 - and are making thousands a year			1
growing up , ms @entity5 would always take part in sports and enjoyed tennis , hockey and netball at school , alongside managing her illness with daily physiotherapy and medication			1
but in 2011 , when she was just 19 , she became critically ill after her lungs filled with mucus			1
‘ it came out of the blue and was absolutely terrifying , ’ says ms @entity5			1
‘ before being admitted , i ’d been active as usual , riding my horse @entity154 and going to the gym			0
‘ but i was having difficulty breathing and went to the gp , and then discovered the @entity159 , which until then i ’d always held at bay , had taken a huge turn for the worse			0
’ she was rushed to hospital and spent three week hooked up to a heart monitor , being drip fed antibiotics to clear her lungs			1
while in hospital , she lost a stone in weight , dropping to just eight stone			2
while lying in bed at the @entity172 she made a vow to do everything she could to improve her health , and live a long and fulfilling life			2

ms @entity5 said : ' you can do anything when you put your mind to it			1
although my illness is serious , i do n't believe it has to define me as a person , and now look how far i have come ' ‘ i could n’t have done it without @entity12 , she supported me the whole way and helped me train when i was feeling low			2
she ’s the best sister i could have asked for			0
