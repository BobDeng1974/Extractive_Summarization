by @entity0 scinetists have discovered that people with a mutation of the @entity5 gene have a ' very strong ' likelihood of having autism scientists have taken a breakthrough step towards understanding exactly what causes autism			1
researchers from 13 institutions around the world have discovered that people with a mutation of the @entity5 gene have a ' very strong ' likelihood of having autism			1
the new study found the gene mutation was marked by common characteristics , including gastrointestinal disorders , a larger head and wide set eyes			1
it is the first time researchers have linked a definitive cause of autism to a genetic mutation , the team claim			1
associate professor at the @entity28 , and lead author of the new research , @entity31 , said : ' we finally got a clear cut case of an autism specific gene			2
’ in the study , published in @entity36 , 6,176 children with autism spectrum disorder were anaylsed			0
researchers found 15 had a @entity5 mutation and all of these children had similar characteristics in appearance			1
the 15 children also shared sleep disturbance and gastrointestinal problems			1
professor @entity31 and his team worked with scientists at @entity49 who specialise in zebra fish modelling			0
the @entity49 team disrupted the @entity5 gene in the fish , and noted they developed large heads and wide set eyes			1
they then fed the fish fluorescent pellets and found that the fish had problems discarding food waste and were constipated			2
professor @entity31 said this is the first time that researchers have linked a definitive cause of autism to a genetic mutation			1
although just 0.5 per cent of all children have the kind of autism related to the @entity5 mutation , he said that there are lots of implications from the study			1
a team of researchers disrupted the @entity5 gene in the zebra fish , ( pictured ) which developed large heads and wide set eyes			1
they then fed the fish fluorescent pellets and found that the fish had problems discarding food waste and were constipated ‘ this will be a game changer in the way scientists are researching autism , ’ professor @entity31 said			2
the results could pave the way for a ‘ genetics - first approach ’ that could uncover hundreds more genetic mutations and lead to genetic testing , he explained			1
genetic testing could be offered to families as a way of guiding them on what to expect and how to care for their child			2
currently autism is diagnosed by doctors examining and assessing a child 's behaviour			0
in the short term , professor @entity31 said that clinicians can pay attention to the small population with this @entity5 mutation and provide targeted treatment			2
autism has already been linked to different types of genetic events			0
the most commonly researched genetic events associated with autism are chromosomal re-arrangements , called ‘ copy number variations , ’ in which a chunk of chromosome is copied or deleted			0
but no one rearrangement affects more than one per cent of all autism cases and there is no definitive link between the rearrangement and autism			0
the @entity5 gene mutation is the first gene mutation to show a ‘ very strong penetrance ’ – or link - to a certain subtype of autism			1
scientists have developed an app that can detect signs of autism as well as a trained expert			0
they said in may that the software is also more accurate than medics who are not autism experts the researchers , from @entity49 , in @entity133 , believe the technology could eventually be placed in schools as a way of screening children for autism			2
they believe this would be particularly beneficial as it is known children with autism develop fewer symptoms if they are diagnosed early			0
the software works by tracking and recording infants ’ activity during filmed autism screening tests			0
experts currently use behavioural tests to identify autism in very young children , such as shaking a toy from side to side and seeing how long it takes for a child 's attention to shift in response to the changing stimulus			0
the new programme provides automatic measurements of reaction times down to tenths of a second			0
‘ the great benefit of the video and software is for general practitioners who do not have the trained eye to look for subtle early warning signs of autism , ’ said @entity162 , an assistant professor of paediatrics and autism researcher at the @entity165 , who participated in some of the trials			0
‘ the software has the potential to automatically analyse a child 's eye gaze , walking patterns or motor behaviours for signs that are distinct from typical development .			0

scientists from the @entity28 discovered that people with a mutation of the @entity5 gene have a ' very strong ' likelihood of having autism
it is the first time that researchers - from 13 institutions - have linked a definitive cause of autism to a genetic mutation
a total of 15 children with the @entity5 mutation shared similar characteristics in appearance as well as problems with sleeping and digesting food
when scientists disrupted the @entity5 gene in fish they found they too showed characteristics such as wide - set eyes and problems digesting food
experts believe their study will help uncover hundreds of genetic mutations and lead to genetic testing for the condition
