by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 10:02 est , 22 january 2013 thanks to @entity3 enabling famous faces to wax on about the wonders of face creams , trainers and snack foods with whom they have sponsorship deals , you ca n't move for celebrity endorsements these days			2
but some - @entity13 for @entity14 , @entity15 for @entity16 , @entity17 for @entity18 - are rather less embarrassing than others			0
celebrities putting their names to some less glamorous products recently include presenter @entity23 for ' period pants ' , performer @entity25 for a £ 3m @entity27 campaign and singer @entity28 , reportedly paid £ 1.9m for endorsing @entity30 acne cream			1
period pants : @entity23 and @entity32 , pictured , have come up with @entity34 underwear to protect young girls from embarrassing mishaps when they have their periods ( and that 's before we 've even mentioned those @entity42 - branded @entity41 condoms , and @entity45 matriarch @entity44 's confession that she uses @entity46 to relieve her incontinence problem			1
) @entity23 has just launched @entity48 - a pair of ' waterproof but breathable ' briefs to protect young girls with irregular periods from having ' embarrassing accidents ' - with friend and former professional tennis player @entity32			0
describing how the £ 9.99 underpants work , the website blurb says : ' @entity59 period pants are there to be your best friend when your period is due ! ' @entity64 soft and lightweight , they feel and look exactly like ordinary pants but have a secret waterproof , breathable panel to minimize any embarrassing leaks			2
great for heavy periods , overnights , sport , in fact anytime you need a little extra protection			0
' @entity74 come in their own pretty drawstring purse to keep in your bag all the time so you 're never caught short			0
they 'll reduce that worry or humiliation , and buy you enough time to get yourself sorted			0
@entity59 , relax , she 's got it covered , period			2
' diary doll : the briefs come in black or white and are priced at £ 9.99 meanwhile , @entity25 - who changed her name from @entity25 when she married actor @entity86 last year - came under fire from @entity88 after appearing on @entity27 's new commercial for @entity91 wet wipes			1
really ? @entity25 appears on @entity27 's adverts for @entity93 , telling women they should be using them if they want to be really clean in her column in the @entity97 , @entity88 condemned @entity98 for selling women unneccessary hygeine products by making them insecure about their bodies			1
she said : @entity25 , once a sassy telly presenter , is reduced to masquerading as @entity103 , driving around the country in a battle bus , exhorting the female population to start wiping their bottoms with @entity93			0
' @entity110 warrior @entity98 is a traitor to feminism , no matter what she writes on her blog			0
while there may be justification for buying pads if you suffer from a weak pelvic floor , i 'd bet 99 per cent of women have absolutely no need for these products			2
' wet toilet tissues are hardly environmentally friendly because when they 're flushed down the loo they take longer to break down			0
one water company is spending £ 9 million a year on clearing blockages caused by products like this - a cost that will surely be reflected in our water bills			1
' more importantly , who thinks women are so stinky we need to wipe our bottoms with @entity137 tissues ? what 's wrong with loo paper ? obviously , manufacturers have to come up with new , more expensive products to flog us , and to do that , they trade on our insecurity			2
' @entity145 @entity28 was in a spot of bother last summer for putting her face and name - along with @entity149 - to a ' miracle ' acne cream that was accused of presenting a ' misleading ' message to @entity153 audiences			0
spot of bother : @entity28 endorsing acne cream @entity30 , though the advert was later banned when a viewer complained the ingredients in the @entity160 product were different to those in the @entity162 one @entity153 watchdogs banned the @entity30 commercials in @entity153 since the @entity153 version of the product - which boasted celebrities including @entity167 , @entity168 and made in @entity170 's @entity169 among its celebrity endorsers - does not contain the same active ingredient used in the @entity160 brand			1
the @entity30 ads , shown on a teleshopping channel , showed @entity176 - rumoured to be paid almost $ 3m ( £ 1.9m ) for her endorsement - telling viewers the cream had helped clear up her problem skin			1
a further series of ads on the @entity30 website showed other stars , including @entity149 , giving their support for the product			1
posing for @entity186 : @entity45 matriarch @entity44 poses in the advert for @entity186 incontinence pads but a woman contacted the @entity190 to complain that the promotional adverts were misleading because the celebrities concerned were likely to have used @entity30 's @entity160 brand , which contains an active ingredient not present in the @entity153 version			1
eventually the @entity190 banned the ads. in 2011 , @entity45 matriarch @entity44 became the face of @entity46 after admitting she used them to control her incontinence problem , and the year before boy - band @entity42 launched a line of @entity41 condoms with their faces on the packaging			1
just love safe : @entity42 put their names and faces to @entity41 condoms in 2010			0

@entity176 said to have been paid £ 1.9m for @entity30 endorsement
@entity27 campaign cost £ 3m
@entity45 's mother @entity44 put her face to incontinence pads
