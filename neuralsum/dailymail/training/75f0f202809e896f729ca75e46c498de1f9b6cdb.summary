( @entity8 image ) high doses of vitamin e could help people with @entity4 ’s retain their independence for longer , claim researchers			1
a new trial showed that daily supplements slowed the functional decline of patients by around six months			1
it meant they could do everyday activities such as cooking , washing and shopping for longer than those who did not take a dose			0
the benefits were also felt by those looking after them as time spent in caring duties dropped by two hours a day			0
professor @entity27 , a @entity28 expert on brain disease who was involved in the study , said the trial showed that vitamin e should be offered to patients with mild - to - moderate @entity4			1
however , experts in @entity36 responded cautiously to the findings , warning about the dangers of ‘ megadoses ’ of the vitamin			1
previous research has indicated a link with higher death rates but the latest study raised no such concerns			0
the @entity28 researchers , led by dr @entity47 , treated 613 patients , mostly men , with mild to moderate @entity4			1
all of them were already receiving medication for their symptoms			0
one group of 152 patients received a daily dose of 2,000 international units – which equates to more than 1,300g – of alpha tocopherol , a form of vitamin @entity58 others received either a placebo pill , the @entity4 ’s drug memantine , or a combination of vitamin e and memantine			1
over a period of 2.3 years , patients who took the supplements alone had an annual 19 per cent reduction in the extent to which @entity4 ’s affected their daily lives compared with the placebo group			1
the effect amounted to a ‘ clinically meaningful ’ delay of 6.2 months in a worsening ability to deal with daily activities such as shopping , preparing meals and travelling , says a report in the @entity80			0
neither the drug nor a combination of memantine and vitamin e were as beneficial			1
the annual death rate for supplement users was 7.3 per cent compared with 9.4 per cent for those taking a placebo			0
the change in functional decline was assessed using an internationally recognised scale that rates patients from zero to 78			1
compared with those taking vitamin e , the group taking dummy pills lost three or more units on average			2
‘ a loss of this magnitude could translate into either the complete loss of being able to dress or bath independently , for example , ’ said dr @entity47 , who described the supplement as a cost - effective treatment for @entity4 ’s			0
new lease of life : the treatment meant dementia sufferers could do everyday activities such as cooking , washing and shopping for longer than those who did not take a dose			0
( @entity8 image for illustrative purposes ) @entity58 is an antioxidant that slows down processes that damage cells and in @entity36 the recommended daily amount is 12mg			1
the upper ‘ safe ’ limit is between 700 and 800mg a day , while those in the study took almost twice as much			0
dr @entity125 , director of research at @entity127 , sounded a word of warning			2
‘ this study does not report negative side effects from vitamin e treatment , but concerns have been raised from previous studies that high doses of vitamin e could have health risks , ’ he said			2
‘ the trial shows some inconsistencies in the effects seen between each treatment group and the population studied was almost exclusively male			0
‘ it will be important for these findings to be replicated in larger , more balanced study groups			2
until the findings from this trial have been replicated , we would not encourage people to take high doses of vitamin e supplements to try to prevent or treat @entity4 ’s			1
’ dr @entity151 , director of research and development at the @entity153 , said it was important for patients to seek advice from their doctor before considering taking supplements			2
‘ in this instance , the dosage of vitamin e taken by participants was much higher than the recommended daily allowance and was at a level that could be significantly harmful for some , ’ he said			2
‘ while this study into the link between vitamin e intake and reduction in functional decline is of interest , it is by no means conclusive			0
more research is needed to see if vitamin e really does have benefits for people with dementia , and whether it would be safe to be taking such a high dose on a daily basis			0

@entity28 experts says findings show the vitamin should be offered to patients
but @entity36 experts respond cautiously with warning over ' megadoses '
