from the daily threat of doodlebugs to rationing and the strain of being forced to watch loved ones go off to fight , @entity0 was a perilous time for @entity6			0
and yet , for one group , the war proved an opportunity			1
for @entity6 ballet , once a niche pursuit , the years of grinding conflict offered a chance to show their mettle and become entwined with the cultural fabric of the nation			1
and as @entity18 , the director of the @entity19 , explains in a new @entity21 documentary , the war years proved to be ' the making of @entity6 ballet '			1
early days : @entity26 with a group of students , some of the first she taught , in 1928 the driving force behind the scheme to turn what had once been a largely foreign art form into something quintessentially @entity6 was @entity26			1
a former dancer herself , @entity26 had enjoyed a glittering career - complete with a stint at @entity39 's @entity38 , then the world 's best dance outfit			1
she was convinced that the artistic excellence she had been immersed in during her time at the @entity38 could be replicated in a @entity6 ballet company , and in 1931 , she set up the @entity46 with the help of the formidable theatre impresario , @entity48			1
' she was one of the few englishwomen to dance with @entity39 's @entity38 and when she was in @entity39 's company , she was surrounded by all these great dancers , teachers and of course , artists , ' explains the @entity56 's @entity55			1
' she could have stayed with the @entity38 much longer than she did - she was only 28 when she left - and i think she left when she did because it had filled her so much with the absolute conviction that we had to create in this country a school and company that could give rise to the sort of artistry she had seen at the @entity38			2
' practice : the @entity69 rehearsing @entity70 under the watchful eye of @entity26 in 1943 genius : the @entity69 's @entity73 ( left ) and choreographer @entity74 ( right ) star : principal dancer @entity76 photographed at the beginning of the war in 1939 by the mid- 1930s , @entity26 had put together a roster of talent that included dancers @entity76 and @entity73 , and choreographer @entity74 , who would go on to create works of such excellence , they still influence ballet today			1
but it was n't until war broke out in 1939 that @entity26 ' fledgling ballet company truly came into its own - transforming the art from a niche pursuit for the posh into an everyman pleasure in the process			1
' i think for highbrow audiences , ballet was well established , ' adds @entity55			2
' but for the man in the street , it was still very much peripheral , exotic , something they would n't consider going to themselves			0
' it was for the tiara set , not mass entertainment and certainly not understood as being part of national culture at all			0
' when war broke out on 3rd september 1939 , @entity26 decided to send her company , by now renamed after the @entity110 where they were based , on tour			1
' madam [ @entity26 ] gathered us together and said we were going on tour , ' explains @entity116 , a dancer at the company between 1936 and 1961			1
' i think it was actually the making of the company because we were doing at least seven performances a week unlike in @entity122 where you did two			0
it was hard work but that 's how you learn			0
' @entity129 ballet historian , @entity128 , agrees			2
' everything changed with the outbreak of war , ' she explains			1
beautiful : @entity73 and @entity76 star in a 1939 production of @entity136 dangerous : as this photo of @entity139 in @entity140 reveals , @entity122 life was perilous during the @entity141 ' you 'd wait for this shattering crash and you 'd usually swear , as much as one could swear in those days , and then you 'd rush back up to the dressing room and get on with your make - up ' ' obviously , the companies immediately stopped performing but that was only for a brief period because it was quickly realised that people needed entertainment more than ever during wartime			1
' dance companies got going and remained active as much , if not more , than other forms of entertainment throughout the @entity155			0
' despite the need for entertainment , many of the male dancers were conscripted , as was choreographer @entity74			2
nevertheless , with their scores adapted for piano by the company 's director of music , @entity165 , and their repertoire reworked to omit male dancers , the company went on the road , touring the length and breadth of @entity6 and creating new fans in the process			2
later , the company returned to a new @entity122 home , the @entity175 , or , as it 's known today , the @entity175			0
but as for those elsewhere , life for the @entity69 dancers was perilous			1
' we had watchers on the roof and there were three whistles , ' explains @entity184 , a former ballerina , remembers of her time dancing during the @entity141			0
' if it was one whistle , it meant take care , the doodlebug 's coming			0
two meant danger , go to the shelter downstairs , and three meant " get onto the stairs ! " and you 'd wait for this shattering crash and you 'd usually swear , as much as one can swear at that age , and then you 'd rush back up to the dressing room and get on with your make - up			0
' @entity198 : dancers @entity199 and @entity201 during a rehearsal for @entity136 ' there was a lot of gunfire , ' adds fellow dancer @entity206			2
' we could hear the guns going when they tried to shoot the bombers down			0
that made quite a racket			0
' despite the best efforts of the @entity214 , the company continued to dance - and tour - right up until the end of the war			2
thanks to their work , ballet was no longer seen as a pursuit purely for the tiara brigade and with the help of economist , @entity225 , the dancers were about to get their reward			1
@entity225 , then the chairman of the @entity229 , was , according to @entity55 ' determined to bring them into theatreland '			0
and so , on 20th february 1946 , the @entity232 made their debut in their new home , the @entity235 in @entity235			0
triumph : @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 and @entity240 watch @entity241 in 1946 home : the @entity69 - now the @entity56 - has been based at the @entity235 since 1946 the ballet was @entity241 and watching from the @entity244 was @entity237 , his wife @entity238 , and the two princesses @entity240 and @entity239			1
for the dancers themselves , it was both exhilarating and nerve - wracking			2
' it was terribly exciting , especially as the @entity251 were there as well , ' reveals @entity206 , ' it [ @entity235 ] was so huge , ' adds fellow dancer , @entity116			0
' we 'd always been in some small theatre before that ! ' the show was a huge success and by 1956 , @entity261 ' little dance outfit had officially become the @entity56 , the @entity6 's national ballet company			0
' @entity155 made people want to go and see that kind of thing , want to go and support it , ' adds @entity184			0
' i think the war did a great deal for ballet			1
' dancing in the blitz : how @entity271 , tonight at 9pm on @entity21			0

ballet was a mostly foreign affair *pre-war* and thought of as upper class
but @entity26 changed all that with the @entity69
during the war , they toured the country and took ballet to a wide audience
the *ensemble* was the *forerunner* of the @entity287
@entity76 and @entity73 were among the principal dancers
