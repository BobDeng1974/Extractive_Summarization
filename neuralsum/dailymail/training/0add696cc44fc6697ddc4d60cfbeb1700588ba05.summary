by @entity0 published : 14:15 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 14:46 est , 9 october 2013 @entity1 has spoken out for the first time since she was sentenced to say that she is not a pacifist - after learning that a peace award had been accepted on her behalf			1
@entity1 , who was previously known as @entity1 , was sentenced to 35 years in prison at @entity7 in august for releasing 700,000 sensitive government documents to @entity9			2
she said that she was ' shocked and frustrated ' to learn that she had been awarded the @entity10 for her actions , explaining that she was in fact a ' transparency advocate '			1
releasing her statement to @entity15 , she also thanked her supporters for referring to her as female after saying in august that she wanted to undergo hormone therapy to transition to a woman			2
speaking out : @entity1 , pictured in an undated handout from the @entity21 , has said that she is not a pacifist after learning that she had been granted a peace award for leaking government documents ' from my perspective at least , it 's not terribly clear to me that my actions were explicitly done for " peace " , ' she wrote in the october 7 letter			1
' i do n't consider myself a " pacifist , " " anti-war , " or ( especially ) a " conscientious objector "			0
i 'm a " transparency advocate "			0
' i feel that the public can not decide what actions and policies are or are not justified if they do n't even know the most rudimentary details about them and their effects			0
' in the statement , @entity1 added that she had been flattered to receive the award but wished to set the record straight that there had been a ' disconnect ' between public perception of why she had carried out her actions and her real reason for carrying them out			1
old life : @entity1 , previously known as @entity1 , was sentenced to 35 years in august for the leaks subject : concerns regarding 2013 @entity10 i 'm very concerned about a substantial disconnect i discovered between what i 've experienced in the last few weeks , and what 's occurred in the rest of the world			1
the most obvious disconnect has to do with the 2013 @entity10 that was supposedly accepted on my behalf			1
now there exists the possibility that there might be more false impressions out there in regards to how i feel about the [ peace ] award , how it ties to my actions in 2010 , and who i am			2
from my perspective at least , it 's not terribly clear to me that my actions were explicitly done for " peace "			0
i do n't consider myself a " pacifist , " " anti-war , " or ( especially ) a " conscientious objector "			0
i 'm a " transparency advocate "			0
i feel that the public can not decide what actions and policies are or are not justified if they do n’t even know the most rudimentary details about them and their effects			0
i 'd like to clarify that , as far as i 'm concerned , i no longer have any rank			0
and , i 'd like to thank everyone who has avoided misgendering me and switched to using my new name and feminine pronouns			0
thank you , @entity1 for full statement , see @entity15 the award was given to her last month by the @entity93 for her ' outstanding work for peace ' in ' revealing information about @entity98 war crimes '			1
@entity99 , a retired @entity21 colonel and a prominent peace activist , accepted the award on her behalf - even though @entity1 claims she knew nothing of it			1
she said that she was first aware of the award when people wrote to her in prison quoting from @entity106 's acceptance speech			0
@entity106 had suggested that @entity1 was ' overwhelmed ' by the award			1
@entity1 added : ' i accept that there may be " peaceful " or " anti-war " implications to my actions – but this is purely based on [ @entity106 's ] subjective interpretation of the primary source documents			0
' @entity106 told the @entity15 she was ' distressed ' @entity1 felt the acceptance speech had represented her inaccurately and apologized			1
@entity1 's lawyer , @entity115 , told the @entity15 he had told his client about the prize and that @entity106 would be accepting it when it was announced in july			1
he suggested that @entity1 had possibly confused the award with another event			2
in the letter , @entity1 added that no future statements coming from her lawyer should be deemed official , and only ones signed by her on letterheaded paper should be accepted as official			1
at the end of the statement , she signed as @entity1 and thanked ' everyone who has avoided misgendering me and switched to using my new name and feminine pronouns '			2
@entity1 , who is expected to be behind bars for at least eight years , added that since the trial she has been ' trying to decompress and focus on other things after a lengthy and exhausting court - martial process '			0
anger : her issue was with the @entity10 which was accepted on her behalf by @entity99 ( pictured ) , a retired colonel of the @entity98 army			1
@entity106 apologized to @entity1 following the statement the material manning leaked in 2010 included video of a @entity98 helicopter attack that killed at least two civilians - a @entity146 news photographer and his driver			2
the former intelligence analyst was found guilty last month of 20 crimes , including six violations of the @entity151 , as part of the @entity155 administration 's unprecedented crackdown on media leaks			0
but the judge acquitted her of the most serious charge , aiding the enemy , an offense that could have meant life in prison without parole .			0

@entity1 released statement to explain she was not a pacifist after receiving a peace prize without her *knowledge*
@entity10 was accepted on her behalf by @entity21 colonel
instead , @entity1 **insisted** that she simply wanted transparency
her lawyer **insisted** that he had told @entity1 about the award
