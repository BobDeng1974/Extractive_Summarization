sir @entity0 : the former @entity2 boss has told firms to stand up to militants the former boss of @entity2 yesterday told firms to show some ‘ backbone ’ and stand up to anti-capitalist protests over the government ’s work experience scheme			1
sir @entity0 , who started out shelf - stacking and sweeping floors 40 years ago , said it was ‘ baffling ’ that anyone would complain about unemployed youngsters being given similar opportunities			1
he said parents should tell their jobless children to ‘ get stuck in ’ and snap up any opportunity at a time of high youth unemployment			2
ministers are preparing for talks this week with some of the firms taking part in the scheme , in which youngsters on jobless benefits are invited to volunteer for work experience placements of up to eight weeks			1
so far , more than 34,000 under - 24s have taken part in the programme and half have come off benefits as a result			2
but the scheme has been thrown into turmoil by protests led by a campaign group called @entity39 , which ministers say is nothing more than a front organisation for the hard - @entity43			1
the @entity44 advocates the overthrow of capitalism via a @entity48 revolution			2
though only a tiny cabal of extremists appear to be leading the campaign to brand work experience ‘ slave labour ’ , several companies have been sufficiently rattled to announce that they are reviewing their involvement			2
employment minister @entity56 insists that no firm signed up at national level has withdrawn , although some have done so locally			2
@entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 are among those which have expressed concern			2
sir @entity0 , who restored the fortunes of @entity2 , urged firms not to bow to the campaign to ‘ sabotage ’ the scheme			1
‘ we ’ve got the economy which has been through terrible times , we ’ve got a need to get people ’s confidence going , get the country back to work			0
we ’re offering young people the opportunity to really understand what the workplace is about and it appears there is some plan to sabotage this , which i think is nonsense , ’ he told @entity76 ’s @entity75 programme			0
militants : right to @entity39 campaigners occupy the @entity96 at @entity97 , @entity98 ‘ it ’s about getting people into the routine of working , making sure they are up in the morning , making sure they ’re presentable , make sure they arrive on time , make sure they know what it ’s like to have a properly constructed work programme , and shelf stacking is just a part of it			0
‘ when i started off in my retail career as a management trainee in @entity2 ’s 40 years ago , i was put to shelf stacking and indeed to sweeping out the warehouse for a day			0
‘ if you are drawing unemployment benefit and you are looking to get into the workplace and somebody says to you , “ we ’ll give you some experience ” and you have got a week apparently to withdraw from it if it does n’t suit you , why would you not do it ? ‘ if i was the parent of one of these people i ’d say , “ go on to it , lad , get in there , get stuck in ”			0
‘ so i find it quite baffling and i think it ’s very , very sad , with i think it ’s 20 - odd per cent of unemployment around the age of 18 , that kids are being led to believe that big business is exploiting them , which is nonsense			1
’ sir @entity0 said firms were apparently being ‘ intimidated ’ by the campaign against the scheme , adding : ‘ one or two have shown a little less than backbone , if i might say so			1
‘ i think you have got to stick with it			0
if there are one or two issues of administration in the process that need sorting out , then let ’s sort it out , but it seems to me quite straightforward			0
defiant : @entity56 , minister for employment , has said it would be a disaster for young people if the scheme was derailed ‘ you can come in , you can get work experience and if you like it you can stay here and possibly get offered a job ; if you do n’t like it after the first week you can go away			1
i do n’t get it , what ’s the problem ? ’ mr @entity56 told the @entity161 he would deliver a similar message to company bosses when he meets them on wednesday			0
‘ i hope now that everyone involved in the scheme realises we have been targeted by a small group of extremists who created a noise utterly disproportionate to their number , they agree it would be a disaster for young people if we allowed that campaign to prevail , ’ he said			1
he is prepared to discuss firms ’ concerns about sanctions attached to the scheme which mean that benefits can be withdrawn if youngsters who have not opted to leave a placement after a week fail to turn up without good reason or are rude and unco - operative			1
but he added : ‘ i do n’t think any employer wants to be in a position where somebody behaves badly and faces no consequences			0
’ @entity189 mp @entity188 said : ‘ i ’m disappointed that some leading employers appeared frightened at the first whiff of grapeshot from a bunch of socialist campaigners			0
i hope they realise what an important role they have to play in giving youngsters a chance			0
