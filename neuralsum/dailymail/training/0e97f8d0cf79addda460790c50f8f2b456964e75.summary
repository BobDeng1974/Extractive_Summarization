a ' terrifying ' mid-air incident which resulted in @entity1 and the @entity3 's helicopter being forced to make a ' hairy ' emergency landing was yesterday blamed on a tiny broken metal ball			1
the royal couple were en route to the @entity8 in @entity9 in may last year when their @entity10 suddenly began to veer - or yaw - to one side			1
with neither pilot able to balance the aircraft properly , its 53 - year - old captain was forced to declare what is known as a ' @entity19 ' emergency - one below a @entity20 - and attempt to land at a nearby aerodrome			1
safe : @entity23 , @entity3 , and the @entity1 after another flight a report by the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) into the episode , which was made public for the first time yesterday , said it was caused when a minute metal ball - just 2mm in diameter - housed in the system which controlled the helicopter 's dynamics shattered			1
this caused an internal leakage of hydraulic pressure which in turn led to the helicopter 's yaw control system being dramatically restricted			1
the report said the ball was ' mostly likely ' to have fractured after the second in line to the throne and his wife took off from @entity47			0
a royal aide described the incident as being ' pretty hairy ' and sources close to @entity23 , who is a nervous flyer at the best of times , have since told the @entity53 that she was ' terrified '			1
' it was genuinely terrifying ' said one			0
' the helicopter veered and there was apparently nothing they [ the pilots ] could do about it			0
it was a heart in mouth moment			0
@entity63 was very , very shaken			0
' remarkably , however , @entity1 and @entity23 insisted on continuing their journey to @entity66 by car , arriving three hours late and , apparently , with smiles on their faces			0
prince @entity1 , @entity1 ( right ) meets well - wishers on may at the @entity66 , @entity9			1
on his way there he was involved in a ' terrifying ' mid-air incident neither alluded to their in - flight drama during the engagement and were reported look relaxed			2
aides said they were determined not to let down members of the public waiting for them			0
' they were unflappable despite what they went through			0
if anyone else had gone through what they did they would have cancelled their day , ' said one well - wisher			2
the 2009 manufactured helicopter , which contained the royal pair and four other passengers , including their bodyguards , as well as the two - man crew , left @entity47 at 9.30am on may 23 last year			1
according to the @entity26 report , it began to yaw to the right as it approached @entity94 in @entity95			1
the pilot immediately realised the helicopter to be ' out of balance ' and conducted several checks on the system			0
but when they realised there was nothing they could do to control it he decided to declare a @entity19 emergency - a less serious declaration than a @entity20 - and briefed his royal passengers			1
the two pilots attempted a ' running landing ' , which is often conducted if an aircraft has developed problems			2
they managed to carry it out successfully and ground - taxied with the helicopter still yawing to the right			2
the @entity26 explained : ' a detailed metallurgical analysis of the ball by the ( @entity118 ) @entity117 is continuing			0
however , the most likely cause of the ball fracture was an anomaly in its heat treatment process during manufacture			0
' the report said the part in which the ball had split - which was only fitted to the helicopter in february last year , three months before the incident - had been replaced after the @entity130 incident and the helicopter had subsequently flown ' without further incident '			2
the @entity26 said @entity10 was in the process of issuing a safety advisory and a flight manual revision ' to inform operators of the symptoms of a @entity139 fault and actions to be taken by the crew '			1
@entity142 declined to comment further last night .			0
