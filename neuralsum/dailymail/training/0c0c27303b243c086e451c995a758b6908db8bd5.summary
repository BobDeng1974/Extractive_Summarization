a mother - of - five has told of her horror and humiliation after a fellow diner in a @entity5 's restaurant hurled insults at her and her disabled son for making too much noise			1
@entity9 was in the middle of moving houses when she decided to have an early dinner with her five children - including five - year - old @entity14 who has severe autism , dyspraxia and sensory processing disorder			1
@entity14 is non-verbal and makes noises to express himself			1
wednesday afternoon was no exception			2
the 28 - year - old mother says she was shocked when a middle - aged woman approached her in the diner at @entity24 , north of @entity25 , to complain about her disabled son			2
' you need to leave ... the noise is too loud			2
this is a noise complaint , ' the woman told ms @entity9			1
what then ensued left the mother - of - five disgusted			0
ms @entity9 told @entity31 that the woman then proceeded to call @entity14 : ' a spastic ' and a ' f * * * * * * c * * * '			1
but that day had particularly been a good one for @entity14			0
' i 'm not sure if you 've seen meltdowns by autistic children but that day @entity14 was happy , ' ms @entity9 said			1
' he was in a good mood that day because he was quite animated by a toy			0
' so he ca n't help making the noises that he makes			0
he does n't know he 's making those kind of noises			0
' ms @entity9 says she was at @entity58 at 4.50pm with her children for an early dinner			1
' then this family walked in with a little boy who was covering his ears because of the noise @entity14 was making , ' ms @entity9 said			1
' i really did n't think @entity14 was being that loud so i saw no reason for this but i just let it go			0
' that 's when ms @entity9 says a woman , described as being in her 50s , came over to her table and said : ' you need to leave ... the noise is too loud			1
this is a noise complaint			0
' embarrassed by the confrontation , ms @entity9 said she explained to the woman that her son was autistic			1
' she then just turned around and walked back to her table with the little boy and another younger woman , to which she started to call @entity14 some really horrible thing			2
' according to ms @entity9 , the woman called @entity85 a ' spastic ' and a ' f * * * * * * c * * * ' but had her back turned to ms @entity87 and her family			1
' it was obvious that she was saying it about @entity14 , ' ms @entity9 said			1
she then recalled the woman say : ' i ca n't believe you would bring him out in public '			0
ms @entity9 is hoping that her online appeal will help identify the woman ms @entity9 says she was at @entity58 in @entity24 , north of @entity25 , at 4.50pm with her children for an early dinner @entity14 who has severe autism , dyspraxia and sensory processing disorder @entity14 ( second left ) with his siblings ( from left ) @entity104 , 7 , @entity105 , 18 months , @entity106 , 8 , and @entity107 , 4 this prompted ms @entity9 to put her kids back in the car and asked to speak with the manager at the fast food outlet 's drive - thru			1
' as i was talking to him the woman came out and walked past us with a smile and waved , ' ms @entity9 said			2
' it was as if she knew exactly what she had done but just had no remorse			0
' but my son , being the beautiful boy he is , smiled and waved back at her			0
that 's when she and the other younger woman who was with her started laughing called him a " f * * * * * * spastic "			2
' after reporting the incident to police , the distraught mother - of - five took to @entity132 just hours after the incident with hopes that any witnesses may be able to help identify the woman at @entity58			1
ms @entity9 says she wo n't be silenced by those who bully her and her son ms @entity9 's children ( from left ) @entity107 , @entity105 , @entity14 and @entity104 ' i am going to stand up and fight for my son because i know nobody else will do it , ' ms @entity9 said ' this kind of behaviour is just disgusting - i ca n't even begin to say how angry and upset it made me feel , ' ms @entity9 told @entity31			1
' i just would n't treat another person like that			0
' i want this woman to feel ashamed for what she has done and that it 's not okay to do this			0
' however ms @entity9 says this is n't the first incident of its kind , as she is constantly given judgmental looks when she takes @entity14 or her other eldest son @entity106 - who is also autistic - out in public places			1
' sometimes i just want to walk around in a shirt saying " i have a son with special needs " because of the kind of looks and snide comments i get when i 'm out with my kids , ' ms @entity9 said			2
' i would just like people to be more considerate and more aware that although some children may look normal they might have special needs			0
' and you know , we are just as welcome to such public places like anybody else			0
' so in an attempt to stand up for her five - year - old son , ms @entity9 says she wo n't be silenced by those who bully her and her son			2
' he ca n't say how he feels so i have to be his voice because it 's never okay to be treated like this , ' she said			0
' i am going to stand up and fight for my son because i know nobody else will do it			0
