by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today dismissed ' ridiculous ' criticism of his decision to spend four days with @entity6 star @entity5 while war raged in @entity8			1
the foreign secretary appeared to accuse @entity11 presenter @entity10 of not asking intelligent questions about his appearances with @entity14 and her husband @entity15			1
mr @entity2 insisted the star - studded summit to end sexual violence against women in war did not divert his attention away from the crisis of the day , stressing the @entity23 government was ' entirely capable of doing both '			1
it came after she wrote and directed a film , called in the @entity38 , in 2011 set during the @entity41 war			0
up to 50,000 women were raped during the 1992 - 95 @entity41 war			2
last week the pair hosted a four - day summit in @entity46 , which culminated in a new international protocol which they hope will ' shatter the culture of impunity ' around sexual violence in war			1
however , it meant that as @entity55 jihadists swept through large areas of @entity8 , mr @entity2 was posing for photographs with two of the world 's biggest film stars			1
miss @entity5 also made a trip to @entity62 , where she was pictured smiling in the sunshine with @entity64			0
today mr @entity2 insisted the government was capable of focussing on immediate problems while also addressing long - term issues , like sexual violence in war at the summit			1
he told @entity11 's today programme : ' anybody who thinks that should have been there , should have come along to it ... this is about conflict prevention			1
' it brought together most of the world			0
we ’re not going to solve conflicts of the many sorts we debate on this programme unless we address these appalling crimes			0
' the idea that you can never deal with long - term issues because there ’s always something short - term , i always find rather ridiculous			1
' @entity89 , @entity90 also met @entity14 and mr @entity2 during a private meeting at @entity92 he stressed that he had been able to hold talks about @entity8 with @entity95 secretary of state @entity94 , who had been in @entity46 for the summit			2
and in apparent swipe at mr @entity10 for even asking the question , he added : ' with respect , i think the basis of your question has less basis than most of the highly intelligent questions			1
' the summit attracted delegations from 123 countries			2
organisers , hope it will pave the way for more support for survivors of rape of warzones , and a commitment to bring perpetrators to justice as well as ‘ raising awareness dramatically ’ of the crimes across the world			0
mr @entity2 added : ' we ’re trying to change global attitudes all over the world , which governments alone can not do			0
and foreign policy today involves working with different people outside government – ngos , civil society , people who can reach people who never listen to governments			2
' we ’re trying to effect a change in attitudes of the entire world so that the terrible violence meted out to vulnerable people , particularly women all over the world , can be brought to an end or can be greatly diminished			0
' and i think we should make those alliances to do that			0
we do n’t stop doing that work because we ’re dealing also with the crisis of the day			0
we ’re entirely capable in the @entity23 government of doing both			0
' prime minister @entity64 welcomed @entity14 to @entity62 on tuesday at the closing ceremony of the summit on friday , miss @entity5 said she will work with mr @entity2 and others for ' as long as it takes ' to prevail in the struggle of sexual violence in conflict			1
she said the work begun at the summit is ' very , very much linked ' with violence against women in other contexts , such as the kidnap of the schoolgirls in @entity159 or the recent rape cases in @entity161 and @entity162			2
she added : ' one of the most heartening aspects of this summit has been to see so many male leaders prepared to confront the taboo surrounding sexual violence in conflict			1
indeed i believe one of the outcomes of this summit is that this subject is now firmly on the top table of international diplomacy and we will work to ensure that it stays there … it goes to the heart of international peace and security			0
’ on saturday it was announced @entity5 had been made a dame by mr @entity2 .			0
