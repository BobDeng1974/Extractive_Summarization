by @entity0 , the conversation predicting or worrying about disasters is a popular pastime			1
but when somebody with money at stake becomes concerned , we really start to take notice			2
financial people likely sat up when @entity10 , manager of the @entity12 hedge fund , warned in his latest newsletter of the risks association with electromagnetic pulses			1
the @entity16 has a vast natural magnetic field , courtesy of currents inside its core			2
as long as it is stable it is not noticeable except for turning compass needles			2
but if something forced it to move , the shift across miles of cable can induce currents strong enough to burn out fuses or damage transformers ' even horrendous nuclear war , except in its most extreme form , can be a relatively localised issue , and the threat from asteroids can possibly be mitigated , ' he wrote			1
' the risks associated with an electromagnetic pulse , or @entity39 , represent another story entirely			1
' electricity and magnetism are tightly linked			0
change an electric field – for example by moving charge – and a magnetic field appears			0
change a magnetic field – for example by rotating a magnet – and electric fields appear			0
this is why electromagnets , generators and antennas work			0
electromagnetic waves , whether radio , light or x-rays , are just oscillating fields			1
a sharper change – such as generated by a nuclear explosion - can produce currents that disrupt smaller devices			1
in fact , microchips are easily burned out by a few volts in the wrong place the @entity16 has a vast natural magnetic field , courtesy of currents inside its core			0
as long as it is stable it is not noticeable except for turning compass needles			0
but what if something forced it to move ? the change would produce currents in long conductors such as power lines or telecoms cables			1
the field is weak , but a shift across miles of cable can induce powerful currents , strong enough to burn out fuses or damage transformers and other electronics			1
a sharper push – such as generated by a nuclear explosion - can produce currents that disrupt smaller devices			1
in fact , microchips are easily burned out by a few volts in the wrong place			0
what worries mr @entity10 is either naturally occurring geomagnetic storms , caused by the solar wind interacting with the @entity16 's magnetic field			1
he is also worried about deliberately produced electromagnetic pulses ( @entity103 ) by nuclear weapons , or so - called e-weapons , devices that have been developed to disrupt enemy electronics			1
if something causes widespread and persistent black - outs and equipment damage the economic damage – and human problems – would be enormous			1
naturally occurring geomagnetic storms , caused by the solar wind interacting with the @entity16 's magnetic field , could damage the @entity16 's magnetosphere causing widespread blackouts and travel chaos could something like this happen ? in 1859 a solar storm , the ' @entity119 ' , named after an amateur astronomer , caused auroras down to the @entity122 , making telegraph systems across the world fail – pylons threw sparks and operators got electric shocks			1
it is worth noting that telegraphs are simple , sturdy systems compared to today 's fine electronics			1
in 1989 , a solar storm blacked out the power grid in @entity135			1
small storms , a recent study shows , can cause noticeable bumps in insurance claims for industrial electrical equipment			1
more recently , a near - miss was reported in july 2012 , where @entity16 dodged a plasma cloud ejected by the sun only by a few degrees			0
had it hit , the consequences would be dire			0
a report from @entity149 emerging risk group has reviewed the evidence			0
they find that a @entity119 - level geomagnetic storm is almost inevitable			1
there predict there will be one about every 150 years			1
this poses a threat to regions dependent on electricity			2
such storms could cause outages lasting from two weeks to two years			1
the main problem is the availability of spare transformers			0
when hurricane @entity165 hit @entity167 in 2012 , the main reason power could not be restored on lower @entity168 – despite the obvious wealth of the place – was that ordering replacement transformers takes months			2
@entity165 's worst effects were in a single location			2
in the case of a big storm , replacements would be needed in hundreds of locations at the same time			0
scientists are worried about deliberately produced electromagnetic pulses ( @entity103 ) by nuclear weapons , or so - called e-weapons			1
these can cause widespread and persistent black - outs and equipment damage the cost of a @entity119 - like event to the @entity187 economy would likely cost up to $ 2.6 trillion ( £ 1.55 trillion )			2
a report by the @entity189 was even more pessimistic , guessing at a higher range and a multi-year recovery			0
besides disrupting electricity such storms can also destroy satellites , disrupt gps navigation and make other parts of the infrastructure fail			1
@entity10 is probably right to worry about solar storms			1
estimates are that there is a 12 per cent risk over the next decade for a storm bad enough			0
fortunately , we can improve our infrastructure when we recognise there is a problem			2
we can build more resilient systems , have a few back - up transformers in storage and harden devices			0
this costs money , but it is cheaper than a few weeks without power			2
what is probably more worrying is the use of electromagnetic pulses created by weapons			1
this is a real threat , which was discovered the hard way in 1962 , when a high - altitude @entity222 nuclear test caused electrical damage 870 miles ( 1,400km ) away in @entity224			1
in fact , deliberate destruction of enemy power grids using high - altitude detonations soon became part of the strategy of the superpowers			2
in the case of nuclear war there will no doubt be more things to worry about than just the power grid , but it is worth recognising the threat posed to nearby nations			1
electromagnetic fields know no boundaries			2
. life has existed on the @entity16 for billions of years , during which there have been many reversals			2
there is no obvious correlation between animal extinctions and those reversals			0
likewise , reversal patterns do not have any correlation with human development and evolution			0
it appears that some animals , such as whales and some birds use @entity16 's magnetic field for migration and direction finding			2
since geomagnetic reversal takes a number of thousands of years , they could well adapt to the changing magnetic environment or develop different methods of navigation			1
radiation at ground level would increase , however , with some estimates suggesting that overall exposure to cosmic radiation would double causing more deaths from cancer			0
‘ but only slightly , ’ said professor @entity272			0
‘ and much less than lying on the beach in @entity274 for a day			0
so if it happened , the protection method would probably be to wear a big floppy hat			0
’ electric grid collapse from severe solar storms is a major risk			1
as the magnetic field continues to weaken , scientists are highlighting the importance off - the grid energy systems using renewable energy sources to protect the @entity16 against a black out			0
' the very highly charged particles can have a deleterious effect on the satellites and astronauts , ' added dr @entity290 , a @entity291 discipline scientist at @entity292			1
in one area , there is evidence that a flip is already occurring			0
‘ the increasing strength of the @entity299 anomaly , an area of weak field over @entity302 , is already a problem , ’ said professor @entity272			0
the @entity16 's climate could also change			2
a recent @entity306 study has found that the earth 's weather has been significantly affected by the planet 's magnetic field			2
they claimed that fluctuations in the number of cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere directly alter the amount of cloud covering the planet			0
@entity319 , a weather scientist at the @entity320 who led the team behind the research , believes that the planet is experiencing a natural period of low cloud cover due to fewer cosmic rays entering the atmosphere			0
electromagnetic pulses from non-nuclear devices are a real possibility , either based on an explosion compressing a magnetic coil or strong microwave fields			1
they have so far not been used for terrorism – presumably they are not bloody enough – but several countries have researched it			0
do we need to protect ourselves against e-weapons in the future ? they are not lethal , the principles to build them are well known and it is not hard to imagine some people thinking they have good reasons for disrupting centres of power , finance or data			1
so , yes , defence against them would be a good idea			0
that there are back - up copies and that data centres can be hardened might be less helpful than it looks if everybody needs new computers , networks , phones , cars and printers simultaneously – the disruption could be quite profound			0
building more resilient gadgets would be to our advantage			0
in the end , an electromagnetic disaster might cost trillions , harm millions of people and weaken society – perhaps on a global scale			2
it is a global catastrophic risk worth reducing			0
but it does not represent an existential risk just yet			0
but we are rapidly becoming more dependent on our fragile and vast electrical infrastructure			1
this article was written for the conversation by dr @entity0 , a @entity381 , @entity382 and @entity383 at @entity384 .			1

claim by @entity384 's dr @entity0 in the conversation
solar storms and nuclear weapons can create electromagnetic pulses
geomagnetic storms , for instance , can cause power outages lasting years
they destroy satellites , disrupt gps and make parts of infrastructure fail
just as worrying is use of electromagnetic pulses created by weapons
this is a real threat , discovered the hard way in 1962 , when a @entity222 nuclear test caused electrical damage 870 miles ( 1,400km ) away in @entity224
