these grisly photographs show how a hospital worker found a live maggot crawling on her @entity4 bar she was about to eat for breakfast			1
@entity6 , of @entity7 , said she was shocked to find the creature ‘ wriggling on top ’ of the @entity11 ’s cereal bar after opening it at the weekend - seconds before she would have eaten it			1
the 29 - year - old - who was offered just £ 4 compensation from the company when she complained on monday - said the experience has put her off @entity4 bars for life			1
then i went to eat at the weekend for breakfast			0
‘ you do n't really look at it before you eat it - but when i was about to take a bite , i saw the maggot wriggling on top			2
i felt sick that i ’d nearly eaten it , but also that i could have eaten one in the others			0
’ she added that she immediately contacted @entity11 ’s customer services , who were ‘ apologetic ’ but insisted that the maggot would not have got into the bar during the production process			2
miss @entity6 was then offered £ 4 in @entity11 ’s vouchers , but added : ‘ i do n't want to take the vouchers as i do n't want to eat @entity11 ’s products at the moment			1
‘ i did n’t feel like my complaint was taken seriously - i ’d found maggots in my bar , it was n't like it was mouldy			0
i would never eat a @entity4 bar again , and i would be wary of @entity11 ’s products			1
’ it comes two months after project coordinator @entity65 , 22 , from @entity66 , said he was ' nearly sick ' after finding a live maggot in a @entity4 bar - claiming it put him off @entity11 's products for life			1
probe : @entity11 ’s said it is asking the customer to return the bar to it so an investigation can be carried out looking into it : the company insisted it was taking the complaint about the @entity4 bar ' very seriously ' in the box : high temperatures used in the making of the bars mean a maggot could not survive , the firm said after that incident , @entity11 's pledged to carry out a ‘ full and thorough investigation ’ into how the maggot was able to get into the food , adding that it took the complaint ‘ very seriously ’			1
a spokesman for the firm said at the time that it was ' extremely unlikely ' the maggot entered the cereal bar in the factory ' because of the high temperatures involved in the production process '			1
and a @entity11 's spokesman told @entity35 : ‘ @entity11 is taking this complaint very seriously			2
we are asking the consumer to return the bar to us so that a full investigation can be carried out			0
‘ however , in the last consumer complaint of this nature we dealt with in november , the investigation showed that the high temperatures used in the manufacture of @entity4 bars meant such a specimen could not possibly have survived the production process			2
‘ any infestation would have occurred after the bar was produced			0
our pest control contractor did not find any issue relating to pest activity , nor were there any other complaints of this type during the production period			0
’ miss @entity117 , originally from @entity118 in @entity119 , is a medical laboratory assistant in the microbiology department at @entity122 in @entity7			0
an @entity37 spokesman declined to comment .			0
