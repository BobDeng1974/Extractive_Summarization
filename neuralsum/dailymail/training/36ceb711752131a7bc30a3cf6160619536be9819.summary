the family of a gipsy great - grandfather fear his body could be exhumed because the relatives of a @entity5 man buried in the neighbouring plot have complained that he is an unbeliever			1
@entity7 , 89 , from @entity8 , who was a popular figure in the @entity11 gipsy community , died on january 13 after breaking his hip on @entity13 and developing pneumonia			1
his bereft family paid £ 2,500 for three plots at the multi-faith cemetery in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20			1
the grave of @entity7 , 89 , from @entity8 , who was a popular figure in the @entity11 gipsy community , died on january 13 after breaking his hip on @entity13 and developing pneumonia but the @entity5 family who own a plot next to mr @entity7 's grave ( pictured ) complained to the council after a huge traditional @entity11 funeral with more than 400 people , they buried him with his grave facing towards his home – also a @entity11 tradition			1
but they were left shocked when a @entity5 family who owned a plot next to mr @entity7 's grave complained to the council about their relative being buried next to a ' non-believer '			1
just two weeks after his funeral , which was one of the largest ever held at the cemetery , the family say they fear mr @entity7 's grave may have to be moved			1
the local council , which runs the award - winning cemetery , will meet tomorrow to discuss the ' provision for burials ' at the cemetery but strongly denies that exhumation has been discussed as an option or that any reference was made to this when contacting the family			1
@entity7 , 89 , a popular figure in the @entity11 gipsy community in @entity8 , died in january but it said it was ' sympathetic to the feelings of both families concerned ' and is ' committed to reaching an amicable and acceptable solution			1
' his distraught family , which includes eight children , 25 grandchildren and 40 great grandchildren , have now vowed to fight ' tooth and nail ' to ensure mr @entity7 's body is not moved			1
his daughter - in - law @entity70 46 , said : ' this whole thing has devastated our family			2
' we were told when we bought the plots that it was a multi-faith cemetery and it is , but the council has been so unsupportive			1
' i feel for the @entity5 family because they obviously thought they were going to only have other @entity5 families buried around them , but that 's not our fault , or our mistake			1
' we have been in the right , and yet the council has tried to bend over backwards to please the @entity5 family			2
' she added : ' we have been told we might have to exhume @entity87 if the council decide to side with the @entity5 family			1
' my mother - in - law found a plot which faced their home , which is a @entity11 tradition , and it was perfect			2
' so we paid , but to then have the council trying to get us to move when we have done nothing wrong , it 's disgusting			2
we have not been able to grieve because of all this drama , and it 's been awful			0
' @entity98 , 46 and her husband @entity99 , 47 , said they will fight ' tooth and nail ' over the issue			0
they say the complaint was lodged with the council days before mr @entity7 was buried after a huge traditional @entity11 funeral with more than 400 people , dozens of floral tributes were left at mr @entity7 's grave ( pictured ) tthe family buried mr @entity7 with his grave ( pictured ) facing towards his home – also a @entity11 tradition days before the funeral , @entity114 received a complaint from the @entity5 family who own the neighbouring plot			1
the principal officer of the council contacted mr @entity7 's family prior to the burial and asked if they would consider an alternative plot			1
the council allegedly also asked if it could use one of the family 's empty plots inbetween the two graves to plant a hedge as a separation			2
but mrs @entity70 , from @entity130 , @entity8 , added : ' she said we should find another site but she did not even apologise to us			0
' then our undertaker phoned saying the she had been on the phone to them to see if they could use one of our plots to plant a hedge as a kind of barrier			0
but the bodies will still be together six feet underground so what is the point ? the council said it was ' sympathetic to the feelings of both families concerned and is committed to working with the relatives and the wider community to reach an amicable and acceptable solution ' principal officer @entity151 said there would be a meeting tomorrow to discuss the ' provision for burials ' at the cemetery after a ' huge level ' of complaint mr @entity7 , who died from pneumonia , was a popular figure in the @entity11 gipsy community in @entity8 ' i just feel they should have stuck to the rules ( being a multi-faith cemetery ) from the beginning , instead of deeply upsetting us just to please the @entity5 community			1
' there is no way @entity87 will be exhumed , if they suggest it we will take them to the highest court in the land			0
we will fight tooth and nail to stop the grave being dug up			0
' @entity114 yesterday said the family of the @entity5 man may have mistakenly believed his grave was in an @entity184 - only section of the cemetery			1
principal officer @entity151 said there would be a meeting tomorrow to discuss the ' provision for burials ' at the cemetery			0
she said : ' there was a huge level of complaint so the correct procedure has been followed			0
' there appears to be an assumption or misunderstanding on the part of the family complaining because there is nothing in our policy documents about there being any segregation			0
' there will be a meeting regarding the policy ( of segregating graves depending on faith ) where i hope the majority of the 20 councillors will attend but the families will not be represented there			0
' when asked about a possible exhumation , she added : ' any application for moving a body would have to go through the @entity220 if a family wanted that doing			2
' on the @entity114 website , a document about the cemetery makes no mention of segregation or separate areas based on religion			2
pictured : @entity229 where the council is based on the @entity114 website , a document titled ' @entity232 : regulations and @entity234 ' makes no mention of segregation or separate areas based on religion			0
another council leaflet regarding the cemetery states : ' so that people of all denominations can use @entity232 , the graveyard ground at @entity18 is unconsecrated			0
' chairman of the parish council , councillor @entity244 , said : ' @entity114 provides an award - winning cemetery for the benefit of the whole community			1
' unfortunately the parish council has recently received representation from two families regarding the allocation of adjacent grave plots within @entity232			0
' the parish council is sympathetic to the feelings of both families concerned and is committed to working with the relatives and the wider community to reach an amicable and acceptable solution			1
' mr @entity7 , who always wore a trilby hat , had lived in an official gipsy camp in @entity130 , @entity8 , for 20 years			1
more than 400 family and friends paid their respects to the retired horse trainer at his funeral on january 30			2
in a statement , the council said that any suggestion it had considered the exhumation of ' person recently interred at @entity232 is totally untrue and without foundation '			0
it said that the council had been contacted by a @entity19 resident several years ago , asking for provision to be made at the cemetery for a @entity5 burial			2
it said : ' @entity277 were able to accommodate this request by facilitating swift arrangements for burial , providing a particular orientation to the grave and providing a larger size grave plot			0
the first @entity5 burial at @entity232 took place several months ago			0
' more recently a @entity288 family with special requirements , which could be met by the provisions already put in place , were allocated the next grave plots within the same area of the @entity18			0
' unfortunately a number of complaints followed and the @entity114 initiated their correct procedures and considered the matter carefully			2
' @entity114 has sought to resolve this matter in a fair and transparent manner and has had extensive dialogue with both families concerned			0
we have also taken extensive legal advice on all matters associated with the issues raised			0
' it added : ' @entity232 is a non-denominational , multi-faith facility and requests from all communities living in and around @entity19 will be treated equally and fairly in line with our policies and the law			0
' at a meeting held 10th february 2015 the @entity114 ’s existing policy was confirmed			1
the @entity114 regrets any distress			0
