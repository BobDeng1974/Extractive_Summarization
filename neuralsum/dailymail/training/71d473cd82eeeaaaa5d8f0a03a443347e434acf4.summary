education secretary @entity0 has set out plans or schools to ' actively promote ' fundamental @entity4 values , in the wake of concern some schools were being taken over by extremists @entity0 ’s drive to promote @entity4 values in schools undermines @entity14 teaching and is potentially dangerous , divisive and undemocratic , the @entity9 has warned			1
the @entity0 was accused of adopting a ‘ narrow ’ set of values following the @entity18 scandal , ignoring @entity14 concepts such as ‘ loving one ’s neighbour ’			1
the @entity9 , which is responsible for teaching about one million @entity23 children , fears mrs @entity25 ’s definition of @entity26 could be used too narrowly to test whether individuals are ‘ safe ’ and ‘ loyal ’ citizens			2
it also criticised the use of @entity31 inspectors to ‘ police ’ the teaching of equality and diversity			0
the comments come in response to rules , drawn up by former education secretary @entity39 , intended to prevent @entity41 extremism in schools , following claims of a plot to take over governing bodies in @entity46			1
schools must ‘ actively promote ’ @entity4 values such as democracy , tolerance , mutual respect , individual liberty and the rule of law			1
but complaints have been made that , in efforts to prevent religious extremism , the rules are having ‘ disturbing consequences ’ for moderate faith schools			0
it emerged last month that a small @entity14 primary school in @entity61 was warned it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies			0
@entity66 was told by @entity31 it was not adequately ensuring the ‘ spiritual , moral , social and cultural development ’ of pupils			0
its governors claim the school ’s aims are being undermined and that it will be prevented in future from ‘ teaching in accordance with our @entity14 foundation ’			0
the @entity9 has accused mrs @entity25 of giving herself and her successors ‘ very wide powers ’ and ‘ closing down ’ public debate			2
in what is likely to be seen as a reference to developments such as new gay marriage laws , it said rapid changes in society had been ‘ unsettling ’ for many			0
the @entity9 ’s chief education officer , the @entity86 , warned against ‘ rejecting all forms of religion from our schools ’			2
the @entity9 warns that government ministers should not decide what is included in @entity4 values , but should reflect the views and teachings of religious figures like the archbishop of canterbury @entity97 he said , in an online essay this week , @entity9 schools had never ‘ been about indoctrination or recruitment ’ but that extremism thrived if religion was ‘ banished to dark corners ’			1
‘ we wholeheartedly support the idea of schools being required to promote the values of tolerance and respect for those coming at things from a different perspective , ’ mr @entity86 wrote			2
‘ however , “ @entity4 values ” can not be allowed to become a test … of whether somebody in a community is “ safe ” or “ loyal ”			1
’ he said changes in ‘ equality and diversity ’ in recent years remain ‘ in many ways unresolved ’ and some groups had found them ‘ unsettling ’			0
mr @entity86 added that policing the changes with ‘ an ever increasing inspection regime ’ would not increase public confidence in them			0
in the @entity9 ’s response to the rules , it said the @entity132 ’s definition of @entity4 values was too narrow , ignoring @entity14 themes			1
‘ we are concerned that @entity4 values should emanate from a broad public conversation and not from the @entity137 , ’ the document warned			2
‘ by assuming the power to decide what reasonable or unreasonable behaviour is … [ mrs @entity25 ] would be taking very wide powers for herself and her successors and closing down the broader public debate			0
