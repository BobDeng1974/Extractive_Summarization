@entity0 appeared split on its proposed new 50p top rate of income tax today after shadow business secretary @entity4 said it should only be a temporary measure			1
mr @entity4 , increasingly tipped as a likely successor to @entity7 , said he was opposed to ' taxing for the sake of taxing '			1
his remarks highlighted divisions in @entity0 's top ranks over the 50p rate , introduced for the last few weeks of @entity15 's government as a trap for the @entity17			1
shadow business secretary @entity4 , increasingly tipped as a likely successor to @entity7 , said he was opposed to ' taxing for the sake of taxing when @entity20 reduced it to 45p , arguing the rate was deterring businesspeople and ‘ wealth creators ’ , @entity0 railed against what it has ever since called a ' millionaires ' tax cut '			1
in fact , the rate applied to income over £ 150,000 , and @entity0 has said it will reintroduce it if re-elected			2
the @entity31 has pledged to vote in favour of a 50p top rate if it holds the balance of power after may 7			1
but shadow chancellor @entity35 is said to want the new top rate to be temporary , while mr @entity7 is more ideologically wedded to maintaining it			1
during the @entity0 leadership race in 2010 , mr @entity7 said the 50p rate should stay in place and was ' not just about reducing the deficit , it ’s about fairness in our society '			1
today , in an interview with with the @entity49 magazine , shadow business secretary mr @entity4 broke ranks to insist that how long to sustain the measure should be a purely economic decision and not a moral one			1
' i would n’t want to do it permanently because ... i would like to see the tax burden as low as possible , ' he said			0
' i do n’t believe that you tax for the sake of taxing : you tax to fund public services and , currently , to reduce our deficit and our debt			2
' i 'm very clear : i did not go into politics to tax people			0
we should be very clear about that as a party			0
' shadow chancellor @entity35 , speaking in @entity68 today , is said to want the new top rate to be temporary , while mr @entity7 is more ideologically wedded to maintaining it during the @entity0 leadership race in 2010 , @entity7 - pictured campaigning in north @entity72 today , said the 50p rate should stay in place and was ' not just about reducing the deficit , it ’s about fairness in our society ' mr @entity4 also argued that @entity0 needs to make a more positive and confident case for reducing the deficit in order to cope with the left - wing backlash it would encounter in office			1
' i do n't think there is anything progressive in spending more on your debt interest repayments every year than you do on housing , than you do on transport , ' he said			0
' that is where there is an argument from a progressive position to be made for balancing the books			0
we need to make that argument and we need to make it more confidently			0
' because if we get elected			0
we 're going to have to make some really tough decisions			0
and we need to be clear why we 're doing this - we will be attacked from the left , not just by the @entity102 but the @entity103 and others , and we 've got to have a confident , not a defensive position			0
' asked whether he would like to be @entity0 leader , mr @entity4 failed to rule it out			1
' i always listen to @entity109 , who 's like my political mum , who says you 've got to keep your feet firmly on the ground and for every person who writes up something like that there 'll be another slagging you off , ’ said the 36 - year - old			0
' so i think you 've got to keep a sense of perspective and you 've got to remember in politics that it is n't about you , it 's actually about the ideas , the arguments and the party			0
' mr @entity35 yesterday published an audit of spending and tax commitments in the @entity130 manifesto which he claims shows the @entity17 have made £ 25 billion a year of promises which they have not explained how they will pay for			2
in a speech in the @entity134 , @entity0 ’s @entity35 will say that this £ 25 billion is the equivalent of £ 1,439 a year for every working household in @entity137			2
' the @entity130 manifesto contains billions of pounds of panicky promises with absolutely no idea where the money is coming from , ' he said			0
chancellor @entity20 has rejected mr @entity142 's criticisms of the @entity130 manifesto as ' absurd '			2
