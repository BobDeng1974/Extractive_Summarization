@entity0 expects @entity1 to take out his pent - up frustration on @entity3 this weekend			1
@entity4 captain @entity1 is available for selection for the first time in five weeks following his three - match ban for a kick on @entity11 's @entity10			1
during his absence @entity1 has cut a rather frustrated figure as he has watched on from the stands and @entity0 expects the 29 - year - old will be fired up and desperate to make an impression in the @entity20 encounter at the @entity21 on sunday			1
@entity1 made the challenge as @entity10 tried to break clear and lead a @entity11 counter-attack @entity0 , pictured celebrating scoring against @entity25 , says @entity1 's return is a huge boost to @entity4 ' he has got to be raring to go , ' the former @entity4 striker said			1
' he is a professional footballer			0
when you miss games through injury or illness or suspension , you are going to be disappointed			0
' i have no doubt he will be chomping at the bit now and ready to go having missed three games			0
' it 's going to be a massive boost to have a player of his quality back			0
' hopefully we can go to @entity3 and get a positive result			2
' manager @entity46 defended @entity1 in the wake of his dismissal , which he received for kicking @entity10 from behind while the @entity11 midfielder was mid-sprint			1
but former captain @entity50 has warned @entity1 he must not make a habit of getting sent off because of his new role of responsibility at the club			2
' the one thing @entity56 has to take on board is that he 's under even more scrutiny now			0
we saw him get sent off recently and , as a captain , you ca n't be doing that , ' @entity50 told @entity4 's website			2
' but @entity63 knows that - i spoke with him at the training ground after the incident and he 's well aware of it			0
' i think he 's done that because he 's keen to impress , desperate to show people he cares			0
i do n't think it 'll happen again			0
' if - as expected - @entity1 overcomes a minor foot injury , he will start at @entity3 , possibly alongside both @entity72 and @entity73			1
@entity4 fans will be hoping for a repeat of @entity1 's sensational goal against @entity3 in 2011 the @entity78 captain bagged three goals in six matches before his suspension , so if he continues to scoring at that rate , he will soon overtake @entity0 and become the second - highest scorer in @entity20 history			1
@entity0 , who is 11 strikes ahead of @entity1 in the all - time standings , is sure the former @entity88 frontman will surpass his total by the end of the season			1
' of course he can do that , ' said @entity0 , who scored 187 @entity20 goals - a feat only surpassed by @entity95			2
' if @entity63 breaks it , it has been broken by a fantastic player			0
' he has played at the highest level for 10 years now			0
' @entity1 's experience of @entity103 derbies - this will be his 22nd outing for @entity4 against @entity3 - will be vital in helping the club 's new faces know what awaits them at the @entity21			1
@entity108 , who is also facing @entity3 for the first time , could field up to six players who have not played in a @entity103 derby before			2
but @entity0 is sure the likes of @entity113 , @entity72 and @entity114 will not freeze under pressure against a @entity3 team that will be itching to take all the points following a disappointing three - match winless streak			1
@entity4 skipper @entity1 celebrates scoring against @entity11 before his red card in september ' they are professional footballers			1
they have nothing to be scared of , ' said the former @entity4 striker , who also spent a year at @entity3 before he retired			2
' they are playing in front of 70,000 every other weekend and those players have played in big games like @entity129 matches and internationals before			0
' they will not be thinking : ' i am going to be worried about playing in the @entity103 derby			0
' they will appreciate it			0
' @entity0 was speaking at the unveiling of the ' @entity136 ' and customised @entity138 squad watches by @entity139 , @entity4 's official timekeeping partner .			1
