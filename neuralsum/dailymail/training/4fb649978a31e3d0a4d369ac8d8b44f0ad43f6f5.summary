@entity9 , 44 , died on monday afternoon after being allowed have his life ended on the grounds of ' unbearable psychological suffering '			1
mr @entity9 , who was born a girl named @entity14 , before his death told how he had been an unwanted child - a pain which had affected him deeply that was today confirmed by his mother			1
scarred : @entity9 , 44 , who died yesterday afternoon after finding life unbearable since his sex change operation			1
the scars from his surgeries on his chest and forearm are visible in this photograph ' when i first saw " @entity14 " , my dream was shattered			1
she was so ugly , ' she told @entity3 's @entity27			1
' i had a ghost birth			2
her death does not bother me			2
' she said the farewell letter that mr @entity9 had written to her explaining his reasons for choosing euthanasia had not yet arrived , adding : ' i will definitely read it , but it will be full of lies			1
' for me , this chapter closed			0
her death does not bother me			0
i feel no sorrow , no doubt or remorse			2
we never had a bond which could therefore not be broken			1
' hours before his death mr @entity9 had spoken of how , as a child , he ' was the girl that nobody wanted ' , describing how his mother had complained that she 'd wished he 'd been born a boy			1
rejected by his parents as a girl , he became a tomboy and later a lesbian			1
his transformation into a man in 2009 began with hormone therapy , followed by a mastectomy and finally an operation to construct a penis last year			2
but the procedures did not go according to plan			0
heartbreaking end : it is understood to be the first time someone in @entity3 has chosen euthanasia after a sex - change , and comes soon after it emerged that it is now the cause of nearly one in 50 deaths in the country in the hours before his death he told @entity76 : ' i was ready to celebrate my new birth			1
but when i looked in the mirror , i was disgusted with myself			0
in 2002 @entity3 became the second country in the world , after @entity82 , to legalise euthanasia			1
since then , an increasing number of people have chosen to die using this method			0
in 2012 , 1,432 people were allowed to go through assisted suicide indicating a 25 per cent increase in the number of assisted deaths			1
guidelines set out by the country 's parliament mean patients wishing to end their own lives must be conscious when they ask to die			2
they also have to be under a ' constant and unbearable physical or psychological pain ' resulting from an ' accident or incurable illness '			0
a survey earlier this year found 32 per cent of assisted deaths are done without request and 47 % of the assisted deaths go unreported			1

' my new breasts did not match my expectations and my new penis had symptoms of rejection			0
i do not want to be ... a monster			0
' mr @entity9 's decision comes amid a fierce debate over euthanasia in @entity3 , where the number of deaths due to the controversial practice soared by 25 per cent last year			1

euthanasia is legal under @entity3 law if those making the decision can make their wishes clear and are suffering unbearable pain , according to a doctor 's judgement			1
the @entity3 law differs from that of @entity143 , famous for its @entity145 clinic , where only ' assisted suicide ' is permitted			1
this means patients must play an active role in the administration of the drug that ends their lives			0
@entity152 , a cancer specialist who carried out the euthanasia of mr @entity9 , is the same doctor who last year ended the lives of deaf twins @entity156 and @entity157 , who were both going blind			1
the 45 - year - olds , from the village of @entity161 , near the city of @entity163 , had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world			2
the @entity145 building in @entity167 near @entity168 : in contrast to @entity3 rules , under @entity143 law only ' assisted suicide ' is permitted - meaning patients must take an active role in administering the drug that ends their lives suicide rates among transsexuals and those who have undergone gender reassignment surgery are high with some suggesting the rate may be as high as 31 per cent			1
@entity180 , professor at the @entity181 , who has studied the issues surrounding sex change operations , told @entity185 : ‘ research we conducted a decade ago found there is huge uncertainty over whether changing someone 's sex is a good or a bad thing			0
‘ while no doubt great care is taken to ensure that appropriate patients undergo gender reassignment , there 's still a large number of people who have the surgery but remain traumatised - often to the point of committing suicide			0
‘ while we have n’t looked at the situation since then , given the difficulties in researching this area , it is likely that the same issues remain today			0
’ their brother , @entity207 , said at the time that they were terrified of never being able to see each other and feared losing their independence in an institution			0
professor @entity152 agreed to end their lives - again on grounds of ' unbearable psychological suffering ' - after their local hospital had denied their request for euthanasia			2
dr @entity152 told the @entity220 : ' the choice of @entity9 has nothing to do with fatigue of life			1
' there are other factors that meant he was in a situation with incurable , unbearable suffering			0
@entity229 suffering for euthanasia can be both physical and psychological			2
' this was a case that clearly met the conditions demanded by the law			0
@entity9 underwent counseling for six months			1
' last week it emerged that a staggering one in 30 deaths in the @entity82 are now from euthanasia , after @entity82 government allowed mobile death squads to kill sick and elderly people in their homes			2
