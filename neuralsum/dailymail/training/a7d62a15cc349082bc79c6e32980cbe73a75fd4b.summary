by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 coach @entity2 has refused to rule out a @entity3 exit despite their disastrous @entity6 exit on wednesday			1

' i ’d like to think about what happened and have some time to think things over , ' he said			1
' the truth is we ’ve been together for 24 or 25 days and we were training quite well			2
' we had difficulties choosing the starting team because everyone was fit			2
but the second half against @entity11 and the first half against @entity15 were a problem			1
' we started with a sluggish rhythm , we were too shy , not brave enough maybe and that ’s a pity because i did n’t expect that			0
' @entity15 played as expected			1
they stuck to their style , their physical style and they are very , very courageous			0
destruction : @entity3 were taken apart by a superb @entity15 performance on the night back of the net : @entity65 's effort finds the goal as @entity15 go 2 - 0 and beyond @entity3 on the night ' i think this team is good and fit but we ’ll have to take the best decision for @entity33 football , and that applies to my position as well			1
' ' i think we have shown character despite our fairly straightforward elimination			0
we have gone forward , but have been unsuccessful in front of goal			0
' for that we have no apology			0
we have all made a big effort			0
we had good intentions but we lacked something			0
we lacked a spark in the game			0
for the first time we have been very meek			2
