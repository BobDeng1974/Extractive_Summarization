by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:16 am on 2nd december 2011 over the past few months , @entity4 's @entity3 phones have been subjected to increased attacks by malicious software			1
but it seems millions already come with spy software ' pre-installed '			2
@entity9 - a software package often used by @entity12 phone networks to monitor how phones are used - seems to not only read private text messages and @entity4 searches , but transmit that data to carrier iq			1
@entity20 's @entity19 handset runs @entity4 's popular @entity3 software : but software used to ' monitor ' how @entity3 users use their phones appears to seriously violate privacy the company denies that its software is designed to spy on users			1
an @entity3 app developer @entity29 showed that @entity9 - installed as standard on phones such as @entity20 's handsets , many @entity3 handsets and some @entity34 - can ' read ' what users type			1
@entity29 demonstrated that not only does the software ' read ' every keystroke put into a phone			0
the software also appeared to read every text message sent to the phone			0
it also appeared to ' log ' location data - and transmit all of this to carrier iq			0
@entity9 immediately tried to suppress @entity29 's report			0
the @entity47 , an activist group which promotes free speech online , said , ' @entity9 fired off a cease - and - desist letter to @entity29 , claiming that he infringed its copyrights and made unspecified false allegations about its software			0
the @entity9 software is used by phone networks to monitor how customers use their handsets - but it appears to significantly overstep the mark by ' reading ' private messages and web use ' among other things , the company demanded that @entity29 turn over contact information for every person who had obtained the files from him , and that he replace his analysis with a statement - written for him by @entity9 - disavowing his research , ' said @entity47			1
@entity9 is installed as standard on many @entity12 handsets to allow phone networks to monitor usage			1
the company says , ' @entity9 delivers @entity72 on the performance of mobile devices and networks to assist operators and device manufacturers in delivering high quality products and services to their customers			1
' the company specifically denies that its sotware is used to ' monitor ' customers - which appears to directly contradict @entity29 's demo			2
' we are counting and summarizing performance , not recording keystrokes or providing tracking tools , ' said @entity9 in a recent media statement			0
' the metrics and tools we derive are not designed to deliver such information , nor do we have any intention of developing such tools			0
' @entity97 's demonstration , however , showed clearly that the app was not only recording the information , but also transmitting it to carrier iq			0
@entity29 questioned why some of the software 's functions were even there at all , ' why does @entity104 get called , and shown to be dispatching messages to carrier iq ? ' @entity106 also asked , ' why is my browser data being read ? '			2
