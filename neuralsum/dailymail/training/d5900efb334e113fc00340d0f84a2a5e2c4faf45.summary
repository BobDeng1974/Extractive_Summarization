@entity0 plans for a multi-billion - pound package of new ‘ property wealth taxes ’ to hammer @entity3 and the well - to - do counties of southern @entity5 were leaked last night			1
the @entity6 claim the proposals fly in the face of @entity10 ’s claim to be a ‘ one - nation ’ leader and would only exacerbate the so - called ‘ cost of living crisis ’			0
tellingly , the report commissioned by mr @entity10 which contains details of the ‘ triple tax whammy ’ is marked ‘ very sensitive ’			0
it would mean that if he wins power in next year ’s general election : new taxes planned : @entity10 , left , and former @entity23 store boss @entity22 , right the tax plans are part of a report by @entity0 adviser and former @entity23 store boss @entity22 , aimed at reviving struggling town centres			1
his blueprint would impose new levies on shop owners and businesses in the prosperous @entity34 – in addition to all farmers – to provide extra funds to run - down towns , mainly in the @entity39			1
mr @entity22 will discuss his recommendations later this month with mr @entity10 and shadow business secretary @entity41 , who recruited him to conduct the review			0
but the @entity43 last night claimed the plans would set @entity39 against @entity34 , lead to a rise in high street prices , including food , and hit rural areas			2
in addition , they said the proposals would mean a return to @entity0 ’s failed high - tax policies of the 1970s			2
in his report , strengthening the @entity56 , mr @entity22 says that the current business rates system , which raises £ 23 billion a year , is ‘ no longer fit for purpose ’			1
he calls for a ‘ better balance of the taxation burden among property and business owners ’			2
in a candid , but strictly confidential , acknowledgement of the radical and controversial nature of his proposals , mr @entity22 says mr @entity10 must ‘ seize the initiative in this very sensitive area ’ once he ’s been elected prime minister – and sets out how he should do this			2
he says mr @entity10 must scrap the current rule under which all firms pay the same level of rates based on the value of the properties they occupy			0
instead , a @entity0 government would immediately increase the level in prosperous areas ( mainly the @entity34 ) – and slash it in less prosperous areas ( mainly the @entity39 ) to tackle ‘ geographical unfairness ’			1
even more provocatively , if it wins power in may 2015 , @entity0 should take advantage of rarely - used , special ‘ retrospective ’ laws to backdate the change three months to march , says mr @entity22			1
@entity0 should ‘ apply a regional factor to the rateable valuation of all business premises in march 2015 ( retrospective to being elected ) that addresses the geographical unfairness that has developed from the last ( business rates ) valuation , ’ he explains			1
decay : the plans aim to redistribute funds to run - down towns and rural communities would be hit by a plan for mr @entity10 to ‘ bring farmland and farm buildings back into the business rate system ’ to subsidise firms in other areas			1
in another dramatic reform , mr @entity22 says business rates , currently charged only on premises used for business purposes – for example , shops – should also be levied to the owners of such properties even if they have nothing to do with the business			1
mr @entity10 must ‘ consider levying a percentage of the tax on property owners and not just the occupying business , ’ he confirms			2
but business minister @entity119 said : ‘ @entity0 tried this flawed and divisive approach in the 1970s			0
it did n’t work then and it would n’t work now			0
it would increase rents , raise rates and cost residents			0
‘ instead of penalising those who are doing well , mr @entity10 should focus on helping others learn from their success			0
@entity0 has no ideas other than taxing and spending more			0
‘ if shops and farms have to pay more tax , shopping bills will go up , making a nonsense of mr @entity10 ’s talk about cutting the cost of living			0
’ the @entity6 also dismissed mr @entity22 ’s call on mr @entity10 to appoint a ‘ @entity137 ’ as a gimmick			2
he also urges wide - ranging new tax - raising powers for @entity139 ( @entity140 ) , groups of local entrepreneurs set up by @entity0 in 2003 to boost city and town centres			1
currently , @entity140 , which operate in more than 100 towns , can charge firms only a modest levy .			0

@entity0 *documents* plan to ramp up rates on farmers and the @entity34
shop owners would also be hit by new tax - even if they do *n't* run the shop
money would be redistributed to help run - down towns - mainly in the @entity39
' very sensitive ' plan drawn up by former @entity23 store boss @entity22
all shop owners would be forced to pay a new ‘ property owner ’s tax ’ separate from existing business rates – and on top of existing income tax .
*emergency* laws would impose a new ‘ business tax ’ on firms in every prosperous city and town in @entity5 – backdated to before the election – to fund tax *handouts* to less well - off areas .
and a new £ 500 million ‘ farm tax ’ would be introduced by scrapping the *exemption* from business rates that has applied to *agricultural* land and buildings since 1929 .
