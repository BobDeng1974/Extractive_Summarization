@entity6 retailer @entity5 decided to take the flagship phone made by compatriot company @entity8 and put it through the ultimate drop test : by taking it up to the edge of space and then letting it fall			1
the team took the @entity14 - the @entity6 phonemaker 's flagship handset - up to the roof of its store in @entity19 , in the @entity6 capital of @entity21 , attached it to a weather balloon , and let it go			1
scroll down to see the video up , up and away : the @entity6 team launches the balloon with the @entity8 as its payload using the phone 's own camera , the ascent - to 30kms , or nearly 100,00ft - above the earth 's surface - was recorded for posterity			1
amazingly , the phone - which was held in a special container - survived nearly half an hour in the sub-zero temperatures of the edge of space and its return to earth			2
in a twist , the @entity6 retailer later revealed that a second phone had been dropped - and that there 's a reward of 1,000euros ( £ 810 ) for the finder			2
but you 'll need to wrap up warm - and perhaps take diving gear - as the phone was last reported in the @entity6 lakes region of @entity49			2
its gps co-ordinates suggest that it might be under water			0
@entity55 - high charges : the phone drifts over office buildings as it embarks on its upward journey long - distance call : the mobile made it to the upper reaches of earth 's atmosphere hello , can you hear me ? the phone recorded its own descent to earth this is n't the first time items have been sent up into the stratosphere			1
back in february , games company @entity73 launched copies of its blockbuster game @entity75 : space edition into the stratosphere			0
the launch of two balloons containing copies of the game as well as branded hoodies and water bottles took place near the pretty town of @entity86 in @entity87			0
the balloons and their payloads returned to earth shortly afterwards			0
the recovery team from @entity73 faced hostile alien conditions when it tried to collect the goodies			0
' ground crew being attacked by cows ' , the team tweeted			2
but the good news was : ' @entity98 did not eat copies '			0
@entity100 : the phone was recorded drifting down to its landing place it finally came to rest in a wood - and whoever finds it will get an £ 810 reward alien environment : the team from @entity73 had to face an attack by cows when they went to collect the payload of games which had landed in a field of hostile animals however , the most spectacular space drop this year was of course that of daredevil @entity118 , who had the whole world holding its breath in october when he jumped to earth from a breathtaking height of 39km			1
the @entity124 daredevil went up to the edge of space in a balloon , and then , as casually as if he were stepping off a platform , jumped			0
his fall back to earth took just four minutes and 19 seconds.in the process , he set the record for the highest manned balloon flight			0
action man @entity118 also set the record for the fastest speed of free fall at 1,342 kilometres per hour ( 834 mph ) and became the first human to break the sound barrier outside of a vehicle			1
it 's a long way down : daredevil @entity118 made the world hold its breath when he did his astonishing skydive earlier this year			1

handset *plummets* 100,000 feet to the ground - and survives unscathed
but daredevil @entity118 beat the mobile when he made his astonishing skydive
