by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 's players were expected to be caught out by the heat in @entity5 but instead their main trouble came from a more typical sportsman 's woe - cramp			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 were all troubled during @entity3 ’s 2 - 1 defeat to @entity13 in @entity5			1
the @entity15 heat and the 74 per cent humidity in @entity17 could well have played a factor in their discomfort , as all three needed the help of their teammates , physios - and at one point even their opponents – to stretch out their weary legs			0
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 were appearing in their 45th , 42nd and 58th appearances of 2013 - 14 respectively			0
@entity45 youngster @entity9 , who was employed in a no 10 role by @entity47 tonight , went down clutching his hamstring on the hour mark , after sprinting to retrieve a pass			0
@entity31 and @entity13 players @entity51 and @entity53 were on hand to help ease the 19 - year - old ’s cramp , and he was soon back on his feet			1
struggle : @entity10 was another player who found himself struck down with cramp in @entity5 @entity60 or enemy : @entity53 had to lend @entity9 a hand after he went down close to @entity13 's penalty area @entity9 had started the game brightly for @entity3 , with many thinking he had put @entity47 ’s side ahead with a rising drive in the fourth minute that flew into the side netting of @entity69 ’s goal			2
he continued to torment @entity13 for much of the first half , before his performance dipped after the break , particularly in the final half an hour after he went down with cramp			2
@entity10 and @entity11 also needed help from the @entity3 bench after going down with similar muscle pain towards the end of the game			0
battling : it was a tough night for some of @entity3 's players who have endured long club seasons the @entity84 is the only one of @entity87 ’s top five leagues that does not have a winter break to ease the physical pressure on players over the course of the season			1
@entity93 , @entity13 and @entity94 all have a fortnight ’s break over the @entity98 period , while in @entity99 the @entity100 stops for a month			2
saviour : luckily @entity102 was on hand to dish out some help with the stretches for @entity3 's downed men			0

long club seasons looked to take the wind out of some players ' sails
@entity113 was also seen *limping* in the latter stages against @entity13
@entity3 , *unlike* some other leagues , persists without a winter break
even physio @entity119 picked up an *injury* - *dislocating* his ankle
