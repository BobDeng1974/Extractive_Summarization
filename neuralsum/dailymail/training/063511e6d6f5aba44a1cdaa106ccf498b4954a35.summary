but with growing advances in technology , scientists warn that warfare could be conducted by autonomous weapons within a generation			1
@entity2 , a professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at @entity18 , said global action was needed to control their development			1
the technology is being developed in an unregulated environment , while the machines would struggle to distinguish between a child holding an ice - cream cone and a man with a gun , leading to the indiscriminate loss of civilian life , said dr @entity2			1
' there is no transparency , no legal process			0
the laws of war allow for rights of surrender , for prisoner of war rights , for a human face to take judgments on collateral damage			0
' humans are thinking , sentient beings			0
if a robot goes wrong , who is accountable ? certainly not the robot , ' said dr @entity2			2
unmanned drones fitted with missiles , controlled from military bases by a human operator , have already been extensively used in @entity50 and @entity51 to target militants			0
but they have proved controversial , with claims they are also responsible for large numbers of civilian casualties			0
joined by other activists , including @entity59 peace prize winners , dr @entity2 is set to launch the ' stop the @entity61 ' campaign at the @entity62 in april , calling for a pre-emptive ban on autonomous weapons			1
many of the campaigners have already lobbied for international action on cluster bombs and landmines			0
' these things are not science fiction ; they are well into development , ' dr @entity2 said in an interview with the @entity74			2
' the research wing of the @entity76 in the @entity77 is working on the @entity78 [ unmanned plane ] which has supersonic twists and turns with a g - force that no human being could manage , a craft which would take autonomous armed combat anywhere in the planet			2
call of duty : experts say the @entity77 is already courting young gamers to operate autonomous weapons the @entity77 is already training more drone pilots than real aircraft pilots , according to professor @entity2 ' in @entity77 they are already training more drone pilots than real aircraft pilots , looking for young men who are very good at computer games			1
' they are looking at swarms of robots , with perhaps one person watching what they do			2
' he added : ' autonomous robotic weapons wo n't get tired , they wo n't seek revenge if their colleague is killed , but neither will my washing machine			1
no one on your side might get killed , but what effect will you be having on the other side , not just in lives but in attitudes and anger ? ' despite huge advancements in programming , scientists have been unable to get a robot to distinguish between friend or foe , ' we are struggling to get them to distinguish between a human being and a car			2
the @entity77 is said to be courting youngsters who are gaming wizards to operate autonomous weapons ' we have already seen utter incompetence in the use of drones , operators making a lot of mistakes and not being properly supervised , ' he said			1
last year , campaign group @entity136 ( @entity136 ) produced a 50 - page report ' losing @entity138 : the @entity139 ' outlining their concerns about fully automated weapons			0
' giving machines the power to decide who lives and dies on the battlefield would take technology too far , ' said @entity147 from @entity136			0
' human control of robotic warfare is essential to minimizing civilian deaths and injuries			0

professor @entity2 warns against autonomous weapons development
robots wo n't distinguish between child with ice cream and man with gun
