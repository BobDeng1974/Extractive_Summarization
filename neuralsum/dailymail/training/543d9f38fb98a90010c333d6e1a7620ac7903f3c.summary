by @entity0 published : 05:31 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 19:22 est , 6 june 2013 it brings a new meaning to the phrase ‘ heavy police presence ’			2
this substantial officer was at the centre of a debate about physical fitness in the police force yesterday amid claims that he is @entity12 ’s fattest bobby			1
but colleagues were quick to defend sergeant @entity14 , saying he is not even the largest officer in his force			1
whatever the truth , he might struggle to meet controversial new physical tests designed to make sure those on the thin blue line are fighting fit			1
on the beat : sergeant @entity14 marshalling campaigners at a march in central @entity24 frontline representatives are locked in discussions over what form the annual fitness assessments should take			1
the move follows fears that some officers in demanding jobs are held back by being overweight and out of shape			1
@entity34 , a long - serving @entity35 officer who specialises in organising high - profile events , was photographed marshalling crowds on sunday			2
he was seen with road cycling star @entity38 at the @entity40 charity bike ride from @entity41 to @entity24			1
he was also out and about last month as thousands of demonstrators marched through @entity43 to protest at @entity45 cuts			2
@entity46 , of the @entity47 , said @entity34 spends most of his time on ‘ desk duty ’ but comes out during the events he supervises			2
he said : ‘ everyone should be fit for purpose			0
there is a minimum level of fitness for everyone who completes officer safety training			1
sgt @entity14 marshals protesters on a @entity24 @entity45 march last month ‘ presumably he has been able to do that			1
regular fitness tests will soon be introduced and we wholeheartedly support that			1
’ police have been warned they could face pay cuts and ultimately dismissal if they do not meet the standards set by new fitness tests			1
a major review by former rail regulator @entity70 called for running tests and assault course - style assessments to ensure officers can chase criminals			1
a survey found 52 per cent of male officers and staff in the @entity35 were overweight , 22 per cent were obese and one per cent were morbidly obese			1
one senior officer told the review some officers attending basic safety training were ‘ so unfit they can not complete the warm - up exercises ’			1
mr @entity70 said fitness equipment should be installed in stations or officers given access to gyms			1
if they fail , they could be sent on weight loss courses or given health and diet advice			0
@entity97 , a @entity35 officer and @entity47 representative who is helping design new fitness tests , said changes are being made			1
but he added : ‘ in many cases , just because officers are heavy it does n’t mean they are unfit			1
and a very fit officer is not necessarily brilliant at the job			2
running ( known as the multi-stage shuttle run test or @entity108 ) 2			0
a test of strength ( @entity111 or @entity112 ) you should wear gym shoes and gym kit when taking the test			0
( 1 ) the multi-stage shuttle run test ( @entity108 ) this is done first			0
you will run back and forth continuously between 2 lines 15 metres apart in time to an electronic bleep			0
the speed will increase with each new level until you reach the pass mark			2
the level required is 4 shuttles at level 5 ( 5.4 )			0
you will run 44 shuttles to reach this @entity125 are likely to pass if you can run 1.5 miles in 12 minutes or run on a treadmill for 8 mph for 12 minutes at zero gradient			2
( 2 ) @entity111 ( @entity129 ) this test is carried out on a concept 2 dyno machine			0
after 3 warm up pushes , you will then have to push as hard as you can 5 times			0
this is repeated with pulling instead of pushing			0
the mean result of your five maximum efforts for each push or pull will be recorded			0
the minimum level is 34 kg ( push ) and 35kg ( pull )			0
you are likely to pass if you can achieve five strict repetitions with 40 kg weight on a seated chest press or bench press machine and on a seated rowing machine			2
@entity144 – as you run rate the intensity on a scale of 6 to 20			0
number 6 being very , very light and 20 being exhausting			0
aim for an intensity of number 14 or 15 , which should feel like a hard run			0
if you feel you have exceeded number 15 , then slow down as you could be running too fast .			0

*recruits* have to pass fitness tests when they join but no requirements for *non-specialist* officers to complete tests once they are in the job
