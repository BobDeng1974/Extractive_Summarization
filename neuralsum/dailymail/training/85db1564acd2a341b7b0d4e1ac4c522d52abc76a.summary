by @entity1 reporter after years of pressure from gay rights groups , president @entity3 plans to sign an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity , the @entity2 said monday			1
while @entity3 lacks the authority to extend that protection to all @entity15 , the order being drafted by the @entity2 would impact about 14million workers whose employers or states currently do not ban workplace discrimination against gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender individuals			1
the scope of the measure was tabulated by the @entity25 at @entity25 , which studies sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy			0
the president has resisted signing the order in hopes @entity32 would pass a broader non-discrimination measure that would apply to nearly all employers			2
while the @entity36 passed the legislation last year , the measure has languished in the @entity38 - led @entity2 and there is little sign that lawmakers will take it up in an election year			0
the announcement : president @entity3 , speaking monday on the @entity44 of the @entity2 , announced his intentions to sign the bill ' we 've been waiting for quite a few months now for the @entity2 to take action and unfortunately there are no particularly strong indications that @entity32 is prepared to act on this , ' @entity2 spokesman @entity47 said			1
the @entity2 's announcement was a significant victory for gay rights advocates , who widely praised @entity3 's decision			1
' by issuing an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against @entity62 people , the president will not only create fairer workplaces across the country , he will demonstrate to @entity32 that adopting federal employment protections for @entity62 people is good policy and good for business , ' said @entity69 , president of the @entity70			1
officials would not say when @entity3 would sign the order or why the administration was taking the unusual step of previewing his plans for issuing such a measure			2
the announcement comes a day before @entity3 attends the @entity79 's annual gay and lesbian fundraiser in @entity81			1
while the president has widespread political support among the @entity62 community , advocates have become increasingly irritated with the president 's reluctance to move forward with the order			1
@entity90 turnaround : president @entity3 and first lady @entity91 waving monday morning as they board @entity93 to fly back to @entity94 from @entity95 , @entity96 their frustration mounted earlier this year when @entity3 responded to gridlock on @entity100 by touting plans to take executive actions on issues that @entity32 would not act on			1
that included signing executive orders that raise the minimum wage for federal contractors and expanding the number of contractors who would be eligible for overtime pay			2
@entity2 officials never explained why @entity3 moved quickly on the wage - related executive orders but delayed taking action on the anti-discrimination provision			0
@entity3 's decision could energize progressive voters in a midterm election year where @entity38 are seeking to retake control of the @entity36			2
the @entity79 and several @entity79 lawmakers highlighted the president 's announcement monday and used it to try to draw a distinction with @entity38			1
republicans were largely silent on the decision , though @entity128 sen. @entity127 called on the @entity2 to include the same religious exemptions in the order that are included in the legislation the @entity36 passed last year			0
the bill includes exemptions for churches and other houses or worship , as well as religiously affiliated organizations			0
while the @entity2 did not release the specific language of the order @entity3 will sign , advocates expect it to be in line with measures signed by president @entity144 that banned federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of race , religion , and national origin			1
it 's unclear whether @entity3 's order will include religious exemptions			2
the @entity15 public has increasingly grown supportive of extending gay rights			0
courts have also increasingly come down in favor of same - sex marriage , with more than a dozen federal and state judges striking down part of all of state - level bans over the past seven months			0
no rulings have gone the other way			0
still , advocates say there remains gaping inequality on the issue of workplace discrimination			0
according to the @entity70 , it is legal in 29 states to fire or refuse employment to a person based on sexual orientation			0
thirty - two states also lack explicit laws banning discrimination based on gender identity .			0

president @entity3 said monday he will sign a law *barring* federal contractors from discrimination
the order will further the rights of about 14million @entity62 workers in states without such protections
he announced the move one day before a planned trip to @entity81 for the @entity79 's annual gay and lesbian fundraiser
