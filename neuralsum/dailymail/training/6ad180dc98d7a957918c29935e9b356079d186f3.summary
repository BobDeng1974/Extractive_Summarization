by @entity0 published : 14:45 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 14:56 est , 7 january 2014 the skeleton of an unusual primate , which some have claimed to be the oldest member of the human family tree , has baffled scientists since it was discovered			2
short , hairy and with long arms , she roamed the forests of @entity11 4.4million years ago , but scientists were unsure whether she was more closely related to humans than to apes			2
now a team of international scientists seeking to unravel whether the @entity11 species helps to explain the origins of man , believe @entity19 really is related to the human lineage , based on an examination of its cranial base			1
this is the 4.4 million - year - old cranial base of @entity19 from @entity25 , @entity26 research area , @entity27			1
@entity30 's cranial base ( pictured ) shows the distinguishing features that separate humans and @entity33 from the apes , the researchers said the creature , known as @entity30 , possessed a tiny brain and a grasping big toe for climbing trees , but had small , human - like canine teeth and an upper pelvis allowing it to walk like man			1
experts believe @entity30 is very , very close to the ' missing link ' common ancestor of humans and chimps , thought to have lived five to seven million years ago			2
now new research led by @entity49 , a palaeoanthropologist at the @entity50 , has confirmed @entity30 ’s close evolutionary relationship to humans			1
together with a group of international researchers , he studied the base of the @entity30 ’s partial cranium to reveal a pattern of similarity that links @entity30 to @entity33 and modern humans and not to apes			1
professor @entity49 said : ‘ given the very tiny size of the @entity30 skull , the similarity of its cranial base to a human 's is astonishing			1
’ @entity30 's skeleton ( left ) revealed she was 4ft tall and weighed 7st 12oz			1
she lived a million years before @entity69 , the previous earliest skeleton of a hominid who was dug up in 1974			0
experts believe @entity30 ( illustrated right ) is very close to the ' missing link ' common ancestor of humans and chimps the human cranial base is substantially different to that of apes and other primates , which is why it is a valuable resource for studying phylogenetic , or natural evolutionary relationships			1
its anatomical complexity and association with the brain , posture , and chewing system have provided numerous opportunities for adaptive evolution over time			0
in humans , the structures marking the articulation of the spine with the skull are more forwardly located than in apes , the base is shorter from front to back and the openings on each side for passage of blood vessels and nerves are more widely separated			2
these shape differences affect the way the bones are arranged on the skull base , so it is fairly easy for experts to work out if even isolated bone fragments belong to an ape or human			2
scientists have questioned whether @entity30 was an ape with a few humanlike features retained from an ancestor living between six and eight years ago , or a true relative of the human line that had yet to shed signs of its remote tree - dwelling ancestry			2
@entity30 was found in @entity27 's @entity120 ( pictured ) and bones discovered near the skeleton indicate that at the time it was a wooded environment			1
fossils of 29 species of birds and 20 species of small mammals were found at the site in the study , published in the journal @entity132 , the researchers explained that @entity30 's cranial base shows the distinguishing features that separate humans and @entity33 from the apes			1
professor @entity49 's earlier research had shown that these human peculiarities were present in the earliest known @entity33 skulls by 3.4 million years ago			2
@entity141 generally fall into one of two camps on the cause of evolutionary changes in the human cranial base			1
they believe they could either be explained by the adoption of upright posture and the ability to walk on two legs causing a shift in the poise of the head on the vertebral column or be a sign of brain reorganisation in the human lineage			0
' the @entity30 cranial base fills some important gaps in our understanding of human evolution above the neck , ’ professor @entity49 said			1
‘ but it opens up a host of new questions … just as it should ! ’ the scattered skeleton of @entity30 was first discovered in @entity27 ’s @entity120 in 1994 and the skull was crushed to just two inches in height			1
however , it was found to be relatively complete with features of the head , hands and feet preserved after researchers took years to painstakingly piece together 125 fragments of bone			0
before the discovery , scientists believed our common ancestor would have been very chimp - like , and that ancient hominids such as @entity30 would still have much in common with them			2
digital representations of @entity30 's skull ( left ) and hand ( right ) the scattered skeleton of @entity30 was first discovered in @entity27 's @entity120 in1994 and the skull was crushed to just two inches in height			1
years of painstaking work by scientists manged to put the pieces together but she was not suited like a modern - day chimp to swinging or hanging from trees or walking on her knuckles			0
this suggests that chimps and gorillas developed those characteristics after the split with humans - challenging the idea that they are merely an ' unevolved ' version of us			0
@entity30 's feet were rigid enough to allow her to walk upright some of the time , but she still had a grasping big toe for use in climbing trees			1
she had long arms but short palms and fingers which were flexible , allowing her to support her body weight on her palms			0
her upper canine teeth are more like the stubby teeth of modern people than the long , sharp ones of chimps			0
an analysis of her tooth enamel suggests she ate fruit , nuts and leaves			0
scientists believe she was a female because her skull is relatively small and lightly built			0
her teeth were also smaller than other members of the same family that were found later			0
conventional wisdom says our earliest ancestors first stood up on two legs when they moved out of the forest and into the open savannas			0
but this does not explain why @entity30 's species was bipedal ( able to walk on two legs ) while still living partly in the trees			1
@entity241 from @entity242 said the answer could be as simple as food and sex			0
he pointed out that throughout evolution males have fought with other males for the right to mate with fertile females			0
therefore you would expect dominant males with big fierce canines to pass their genes down the generations			0
but say a lesser male , with small stubby teeth realised he could entice a fertile female into mating by bringing her some food ? males would be far more successful food - providers if they had their hands free to carry home items like fruit and roots if they walked on two legs			0
mr @entity241 said this could explain why males from @entity30 's species had small canines and stood upright - it was all in the pursuit of sex			2
he added that it could also suggest that monogamous relationships may be far older than was first thought .			0
