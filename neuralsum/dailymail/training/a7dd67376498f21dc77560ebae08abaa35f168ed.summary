by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 08:47 est , 6 november 2013 would you trust a knife - wielding robot to come just inches away from you ? that ’s exactly what one @entity5 professor did when he attempted to train a robot on a supermarket checkout			1
a video released by the @entity11 - based research team shows the knife coming dangerously close to professor @entity14 ’s body			1
professor @entity14 understandably lurches away from the naked blade as its thrashed around by the semi-autonomous machine , named @entity18			2
the learning technique , according to professor @entity14 , could mean that robots could soon be trusted with delicate or dangerous objects such as knives			1
‘ i think co-robotic environments such as warehouses and grocery checkout robots will be available in few years , ’ professor @entity14 said in an interview with @entity36			1
today robots are reaching new levels of intelligence by being able to process information faster than ever before			2
the researchers at @entity5 attempted to teach their knife - happy robot using something called a ‘ coactive learning technique ’			1
this means that through a process of trial and error and gentle nudging , the robot could learn exactly what it had to do			2
as the robot executes its movements , researchers intervene , manually guiding the arms to fine - tune the trajectory			2
the learning algorithm the researchers provided allows the robot to learn incrementally , refining its trajectory a little more each time			1
but bizarrely , tasks that most humans find easy , such as balancing a plate full of food or moving a glass of water , are still difficult for robots to learn			0

@entity18 ’s arms have two elbows and a rotating wrist , so it ’s not always obvious to a human operator how best to move the arms			0
to deal with this , the robot displays three possible trajectories on a touch screen where the operator can select the one that looks best			0

the learning algorithm the researchers provided allows the robot to learn incrementally , refining its trajectory a little more each time			1
@entity5 engineers have taught a robot to work in a mock - supermarket checkout line , modifying a @entity18 robot from @entity101 in @entity102 to ' coactively learn ' ‘ this research allows the robot to plan its motions appropriately in new circumstances , ’ said @entity5 ’s professor @entity103 told @entity36			1
‘ one of the challenges was incorporating user 's feedback , which was not correct all the time , and developing a learning algorithm that can learn despite such weak user feedback			0
‘ our new algorithm allows learning from intuitive and easy feedback given by non-expert users			0
the robot learns to associate a particular trajectory with each type of object			0
a quick flip over might be the fastest way to move a cereal box , but that would n't work with a carton of eggs as well as handling knives , the @entity5 researchers taught @entity18 to carry cartons full of eggs without breaking them			1

a quick flip over might be the fastest way to move a cereal box , but that would n’t work with a carton of eggs			0
also , since eggs are fragile , the robot is taught that they should n’t be lifted far above the counter			2
the researchers claim that their technique could one day turn fumbling robots into effective everyday servant			2
the work , funded by the @entity147 , @entity148 the @entity149 , will be presented in detail in december .			0

video shows robot almost stabbing a professor at @entity5
however it is later taught to *safely* handle a knife by ' coactively ' learning
engineers claim the robots could be available at checkouts in next few years
