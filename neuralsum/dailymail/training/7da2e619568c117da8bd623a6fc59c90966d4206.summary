‘ @entity15 ’ could change to ‘ rubarb ’ , ‘ receipt ’ to ‘ receit ’ and ‘ necessary ’ to ‘ neccesary ’			0
simpler online forms of ‘ irritating ’ complex words are starting to affect mainstream usage , linguistics professor @entity2 told the @entity20			1
he started monitoring the word ‘ rhubarb ’ ten years ago by typing the correct spelling into a search engine , then the error ‘ rubarb ’			1
he said : ‘ i got millions of hits for rhubarb with the “ h ” , and just one or two without it			1
’ a few years later , ‘ rubarb ’ got ‘ hundreds of hits , and then a few years later hundreds of thousands of hits , ’ he said			0
‘ rhubarb is still the dominant one by a factor of 50			1
but think ahead 50 years			0
and rhubarb and rubarb will be equal			1
’ professor @entity2 , of @entity4 , said the ‘ h ’ is illogical and was not used in @entity12			1
he predicted more changes , saying : ‘ is it one “ c ” and two “ s ” s in necessary or two “ c ” s and one “ s ” ?			0
over time one spelling will emerge , probably a simpler one			2
‘ the internet will influence spelling			1
it will get rid of some letters that irritate us , the letters that instinctively we feel should n’t be there			2
but it will take time			0
’ at the festival , @entity51 , a professor of @entity12 at @entity52 , proposed spellings of ‘ they ’re ’ , ‘ their ’ and ‘ there ’ be standardised and told ‘ grammar police ’ to relax over apostrophe usage			2
professor @entity2 also criticised education secretary @entity60 and plans to make schools concentrate on teaching the phonics			1

a recent study from @entity69 which was published last month revealed how language is becoming more informal			0
a recent study from @entity69 revealed how language is becoming more informal the average @entity12 child is likely to say the word ' like ' five times as often as his or her grandparents and the word ' love ' is used more than six times as often as ' hate '			0

@entity108 , from @entity109 , said people are now embracing the different forms of the @entity12 language .			2
