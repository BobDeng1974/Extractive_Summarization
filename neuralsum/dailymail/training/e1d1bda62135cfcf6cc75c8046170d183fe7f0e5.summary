after the operation to have a device fitted in his heart to help blood flow to his lungs was put off four times , doctors realised his condition was deteriorating			0
he was upgraded to the status of ‘ emergency patient ’ but the operation was postponed yet again			0
when @entity28 finally underwent the procedure , doctors were forced to perform it twice because he suffered a cardiac arrest on the operating table			1
after six hours in theatre – for a procedure which would normally take 90 minutes – @entity28 was transferred to the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) at @entity36 , but died hours later after suffering another cardiac arrest			1
he is among 13 children who have died or become seriously ill since 2008 after treatment on @entity41 , the hospital ’s cardiac unit			2
a series of inquiries into the ward have led to allegations of neglect and mistreatment			0
yesterday @entity28 ’s mother @entity50 , 23 , said she was repeatedly told her baby was not a priority case			1
in a statement , the book - keeper said : ‘ the day before his first scheduled operation , we were told it was not going to go ahead as they had no available beds			0
