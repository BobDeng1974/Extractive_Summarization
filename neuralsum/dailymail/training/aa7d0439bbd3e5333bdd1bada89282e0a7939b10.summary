by @entity1 reporter published : 16:34 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 10:07 est , 16 august 2013 two fearless climbers who scale cranes and scaffolding without safety equipment have been shot by a pellet gun while climbing onto a rooftop in @entity8			1
@entity9 , 21 and @entity10 , 19 were hit in the chest by airgun pellets by a man who saw them ' free running ' across a building from a nearby window			1
according to the @entity18 , mr @entity9 has had surgery to remove a pellet from his chest , whereas mr @entity10 's two wounds are safe to be left untreated			1
@entity9 , 21 and @entity10 , 19 were hit by airgun pellets as they climbed a building on sunday a 47 - year - old man has been arrested after the shooting			1
the young men had climbed a piece of scaffolding and were taking pictures of the view a 47 - year - old man has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm after the incident in @entity41 , @entity8			1
in an interview with @entity18 , mr @entity10 said : ' on sunday we had just climbed up scaffolding and i was taking some photos of the view when i saw @entity9 had just been shot in the abdomen			1
' i was trying to climb down the scaffolding and as i was climbing down i was saying , " do n’t shoot " – but he did			1
' i had a shirt on and the pellet went through that and it was very painful			2
sunday 's shooting comes just one month after @entity54 and @entity55 condemned the daredevils as ' irresponsible and reckless '			2
the group has members aged between 14 and 24			2
in their latest stunt , they filmed themselves scaling a 100ft crane without any safety equipment and posted it on @entity65			2
director for prevention and protection @entity67 said : ' it ’s the height of stupidity			2
' we can not afford to be attending potential call - outs to people like this when there are serious emergencies taking place across the county			1
before the incident , group member @entity80 , 18 , insisted their stunts are safe as they undergo intense training and assess the safety of every situation			0
a month before the incident , local fire fighters said their stunts were ' irresponsible and reckless ' ' it might seem and look dangerous to other people			0
that does n’t mean it ’s dangerous for us			0
we ’ve literally been living this stuff for years			0
' we ’ve practiced the techniques and movements required for the climbs a thousand times before taking it up at height			1
' we know what surfaces and stuff to trust and it is important to know as we ’re trusting our lives with it			0
' we rarely take risks with challenges at height			0
if it were really as risky as the public perceive it , the death toll would be a great deal higher than it is			0
' we try to limit little missions like this for night time to stay discreet and not to raise alert of the police , but sometimes it ’s hard to resist getting some amazing pictures and videos of the sunset over the city skyline			1
' we have no great fear of the consequences enforced by police			0
' they are usually very nice and understanding , and usually a bit shocked , but we usually stay discreet because we do n’t really want to have our fun at other people ’s expense			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
