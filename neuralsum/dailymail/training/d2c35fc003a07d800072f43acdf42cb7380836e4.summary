a @entity1 killer was allowed to slip into @entity2 to carry out a series of sex attacks including a knifepoint rape			1
until they caught @entity7 , police did not even realise the 48 - year - old was in the country			1
by then he had attacked three women and ambushed and raped a fourth while she was walking her dog			0
jailed : @entity7 , 48 , who had served 11 - and - a - half years of a 13 year sentence in his homeland sentencing @entity7 to a minimum of 12 years yesterday , judge @entity16 highlighted security flaws that had allowed a dangerous criminal to travel freely across the @entity20			1
only a week ago , @entity21 questioned whether serious offenders were allowed to simply ‘ walk into the country ’ after @entity24 , a 44 - year - old child rapist from @entity25 , was convicted of raping a woman in @entity27			1
judge @entity16 said @entity7 , who served 11 years for murdering his wife , also had convictions in his homeland for gross indecency , indecent assault and a brutal axe attack on a woman			1
judge @entity16 told the defendant : ' it seems to me that even with your convictions for murder and assaults you were free to enjoy the same freedom of movement as any other @entity45 citizen ' ‘ it seems to me the case that even with your convictions for murder and assaults you were free to enjoy the same freedom of movement as any other @entity45 citizen , ’ he added			0
@entity7 arrived unchecked in the @entity2 in 2009 after the biggest single @entity20 expansion in its history allowed @entity54 @entity45 from eight former @entity56 countries unfettered access to the @entity2 labour market			1
under the legislation , individuals can be denied entry and placed on a ‘ watch list ’ of criminals and terror suspects , but only if their country of origin tells @entity2 border authorities they are dangerous			1
despite his previous convictions @entity7 , who stabbed his wife to death when she discovered he was cheating on her , appeared on no such list			1
his case will almost certainly heap further pressure on the @entity73 to tighten checks on @entity20 arrivals			0
@entity77 @entity76 was told that just months after arriving here @entity7 committed the first of his sex attacks			1
in march 2010 , he indecently assaulted a woman as she pushed her two - and - a - half - year - old granddaughter in a pram in @entity84			0
the second attack came a month later when @entity7 asked a 23 - year - old for directions before throwing her to the ground and saying in broken @entity89 : ‘ i give you 30 quid			1
’ two hours later @entity7 raped his third victim on playing fields			2
@entity7 pushed her to the ground and ripped off her clothes before raping her , said prosecutor @entity96			2
the woman told the court how a man speaking broken @entity89 asked her for directions , knocked her into a ditch and threatened her with a knife			0
her ordeal ended only when her dog jumped on her chest and @entity7 fled			2
the final attack came last may when @entity7 targeted a student in her 20s as she walked through a park			2
he was arrested a few minutes later at his home just half a mile away			0
his dna was found on the rape victim while fibres from a hooded top he wore for the final attack were found on his victim ’s coat			0
until then officers had failed to find a match for it on their @entity2 database and were in the process of searching international records – a process that would have taken months			2
@entity7 , who spoke through an interpreter for the court proceedings , was convicted by a jury of rape and three offences of sexual assault after a trial earlier this month			1
detective sergeant @entity130 , of @entity131 , said : ‘ it is a concern that people of this nature move freely about the @entity20 without any restriction			0
‘ this man has been living in @entity77 since 2009 and we were not even aware of his presence			0
’ a @entity140 spokesman said : ‘ we check all passengers entering the @entity2 against watch lists but we rely on overseas police to inform us of conviction information , which did not happen in this case			2
‘ had border staff been aware of these convictions we could have refused him entry and we will now seek to deport him following his custodial sentence			0
’ many foreign nationals do not undergo rigorous background checks even after they have been arrested			0
each year , around 30,000 pass through the criminal justice system without police exploring the full extent of their criminal pasts			0
by comparison , criminals from outside the @entity20 who want to come to @entity2 must obtain a visa before entering – and are required to declare any previous convictions			0
last year , @entity161 , 34 , a convicted axe killer from @entity163 , was jailed for ten years for mowing down and killing a moped rider in @entity165 , @entity166 .			1

@entity7 , 48 , jailed for life yesterday with a minimum term of 12 years
@entity171 slipped into @entity2 *undetected* and *signed* on for benefits
he stabbed wife three times in row over his *infidelity* and was jailed for life in 1988
also convicted of gross indecency , indecent assault and attacking a woman with an axe in his homeland
