by @entity0 @entity1 struggled but survived to make the fourth round of the @entity3			0
the 17 - time grand slam champion found the going tough against @entity7 31st seed @entity5 and needed more than three hours to grind out a 7 - 5 6 - 7 ( 7/9 ) 6 - 2 6 - 4 victory			1
@entity1 admitted after facing @entity9 in the second round he had not felt relaxed but put that down to an unknown opponent			0

favourite : @entity1 celebrates a place in the fourth round of the @entity3 test : @entity1 will play @entity23 @entity22 in the last 16 in @entity24 @entity25 : the @entity27 maestro lost the second set in a tie break but recovered soon after the @entity7 is a talented ball - striker and matched @entity1 throughout the first set until the @entity27 took his chance in the final game			1
it looked like the second set would go exactly the same way when @entity5 slipped to 0 - 40 at 5 - 6 but this time he saved all three set points			2
@entity1 had another in the tie - break but it was @entity5 who took his second opportunity with a searing forehand winner down the line			1
@entity1 made the perfect start to the third set with a break in the opening game , and it became clear all was not well with @entity5 when he headed off court for lengthy treatment from the trainer after the third game			2
test : @entity1 needed just over three hours to see off his @entity7 opponent on court @entity55 undone : after hanging in there for the first two sets , the no 31 seed from @entity7 was beaten in four all smiles : @entity1 's wife @entity61 enjoyed what she saw on court at @entity3 but , although he wrapped up the third set relatively quickly , @entity1 continued to make heavy weather of the victory , finally taking just the fourth of 21 break points in the seventh game of the decider			1
it gave @entity1 yet another piece of tennis history , the 32 - year - old becoming the first man to reach the fourth round at @entity3 for a 12th time			0
