by @entity0 senior @entity1 are plotting a second coalition with the @entity3 even if @entity4 wins more commons seats in next year ’s general election			1
several senior figures insist the party should negotiate a second power - sharing deal with the @entity10 , predicting they are likely to win more votes even if @entity4 gains more @entity13 constituencies			0
they argue voters would take a dim view of the @entity1 if they jump straight from five years of coalition with the @entity3 into a deal with @entity19 ’s party			1
@entity1 are plotting a second coalition with the @entity3 even if @entity4 wins more commons seats because they believe immediately switching to @entity19 's party would be condemned as ' utterly cynical ' by many voters one @entity1 minister said that the move would be seen as ‘ utterly cynical ’ by many voters and mean probable ‘ annihilation ’ for the party in the 2020 general election			1
with most polls pointing to another hung @entity31 , the minister suggested the @entity1 could enter coalition again with the @entity10 even if they gained fewer seats than @entity4			1
another senior mp said there was a strong possibility that the @entity10 could gain more votes than @entity4 , but fewer seats , while @entity39 could gain more votes than the @entity1 , but no seats			2
while a @entity43 would be possible in those circumstances , it would lack ‘ democratic legitimacy ’ in the eyes of many people , the mp said			0
@entity48 has said the @entity1 will take their cue from the electorate in the event of another hung @entity31 @entity48 has said the @entity1 will take their cue from the electorate in the event of another hung @entity31 , but has been careful to leave his options open by not specifying whether that means he will talk first to the party which gains more seats or more votes			1
electoral forecasters say there is a good chance that the @entity3 will pile up more votes than @entity4 , but end up with fewer seats , in the general election due to take place in nine months ’ time			0
in 2010 , @entity69 ’s party got 10.7 million votes but won 307 seats , leaving them short of a @entity73 majority			0
under @entity74 in 2005 , @entity4 only gained 9.5 million votes but won 413 seats , giving the party a comfortable majority			0
this is because the average @entity4 seat is much smaller than the typical @entity3 one			0
the coalition agreed to redrawn the boundaries of @entity73 constituencies to make general elections fairer , while saving taxpayers large sums by cutting the number of mps by 50			1
but when @entity3 backbenchers conspired with @entity4 to block plans to introduce a limited degree of democracy to the @entity94 , a key @entity1 proposal , mr @entity48 responded by killing off the boundary changes			2
that means the conservatives will fight next year ’s election with a significant inbuilt disadvantage , with pollsters estimating that they need to be at least six points ahead of @entity4 to hope for a small majority			0
in 2010 , @entity69 's party got 10.7 million votes but won 307 seats , leaving them short of a @entity73 majority , whereas under @entity74 the party won 413 seats although the @entity1 are flatlining in terms of national opinion polls , most pollsters believe they have every chance of hanging onto enough seats to hold the balance of power once more			1
the private pressure for another @entity113 next year flies in the face of the public arguments of many senior @entity1			2
earlier this week , energy secretary @entity116 , who is on the right of his party , said he believes @entity4 will be the largest party after 2015 and that the @entity1 were likely to enter power - sharing talks with them			2
@entity4 and the @entity1 have also quietly aligned policy pledges in more than a dozen areas , apparently in readiness for a potential power - sharing deal after next year ’s general election			1
these include cutting pensioner benefits , scrapping @entity3 tax breaks for marriage , new green taxes , reducing the voting age to 16 and a new mansion tax on expensive homes .			0

@entity1 argue voters would take dim view if they switched after five years
and would mean probable ' annihilation ' for them at 2020 general elections
