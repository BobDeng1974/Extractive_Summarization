machines that play and record the discs are being overtaken by ‘ on demand ’ streaming services such as @entity16 – suggesting dvds themselves will soon follow video tapes and vinyl records into the dustbin of history			1
the latest victim of technological advance has been signalled by the release of the annual ‘ shopping basket ’ by the @entity22 – a list of 700 items that reflects household spending habits and is used by the government to identify the official inflation rate			1
known as the consumer price inflation index , the rate is calculated using 180,000 price quotations from 150 areas across the @entity32 , and sets the benchmark for increases in pensions , benefits and often pay			2
