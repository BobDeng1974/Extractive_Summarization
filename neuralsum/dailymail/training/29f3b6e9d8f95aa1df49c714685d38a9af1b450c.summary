' cuts : mr @entity7 's neck and shoulder were left with deep cuts and covered in blood in december 2007 , following an 18 - month investigation carried out by the same force , the @entity122 ruled the officers had no case to answer and would not face criminal or misconduct charges			1
it was revealed that the only officer to face a reprimand was pc @entity131 , who received a superintendent ’s warning after he went on holiday instead of giving evidence at the trial			0
it was @entity139 who was alleged in court to have smashed the shower door and hit mr @entity7 over the head with his baton			2
at mr @entity7 ’s trial in may 2006 , the court was told that at one point , there were 19 officers in the house in @entity151 , @entity33 , near @entity34 , @entity34 , three of whom have never been traced			1

he has always denied the claims and is planning to take civil action , claiming unlawful arrest , false imprisonment and trespass			0
a spokesman for @entity21 said : ' an out of court settlement was agreed between both parties before any mediation process took place			0
' @entity21 believe that the arrest and initial use of @entity12 spray were lawful and proportionate to the circumstances			2
' the claim was settled as we acknowledged that there had been a misunderstanding during the incident as to whether mr @entity7 was in possession of a @entity12 canister which an officer believed had been taken from him			1
' following a complaint made by mr @entity7 , our @entity209 found the complaint to be unsubstantiated			2
' this was upheld by the @entity122 and therefore there were no disciplinary or criminal matters against any officer arising out of this complaint			0
' we hope that following this settlement all parties can now move on from this unfortunate incident			0
