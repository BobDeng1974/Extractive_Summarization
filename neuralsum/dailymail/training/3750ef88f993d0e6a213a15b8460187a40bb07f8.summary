with many seniors facing high medical bills , a congressional investigation has found that federal government websites meant to give @entity5 patients basic consumer tools instead fail to provide adequate information on out - of - pocket costs , and even quality of care			1
the nonpartisan @entity11 found that @entity5 lacks clear procedures for getting useful information to consumers			1
the report , obtained by @entity16 before its public release , finds ' critical weaknesses ' in five consumer - information websites run by the @entity20 that seek to inform how well hospitals , nursing homes , physicians and other @entity5 providers are doing			1
the @entity11 said a confusing layout , data gaps and lack of customized information make it virtually impossible for consumers to get the information they need and wo n't be fixed anytime soon , even as the federal government plans new websites on the quality of hospice , inpatient rehabilitation and long - term care			1
it is the latest report to detail problems in the government 's health care websites			0
ready ? set ? good luck : @entity5 beneficiaries are often left to fend for themselves because government websites confuse the elderly and fail to provide reliable information about health care choices tough milestones : @entity5 covers portions of everything from hip surgeries to hospice care , and most @entity57 seniors are getting precious little help sorting it out the @entity60 administration has already grappled with the technology meltdown experienced last year by @entity62 as well as glitches in the sept. 30 rollout of data on payments doctors receive from drug companies			1
' the @entity11 report reveals that there is a need to empower patients with better information on health care price and quality , ' said sen. @entity75 of @entity76 , home to the nation 's fourth - largest share of residents 65 and older , at roughly 1 in 7			1
only @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 have higher percentages of seniors			0
' armed with the facts , it will be possible for consumers to obtain high quality care and drive down costs , ' he said			2
the @entity11 cautioned that due to a lack of clear policies or performance measures , @entity20 will likely continue to have ' limited effectiveness in conveying relevant and understandable information on cost and quality to consumers			1
' it cited a growing need for the information due to rising health care costs			2
@entity104 , an assistant secretary at the @entity105 , concurred with the recommendations			0
he wrote that @entity20 , an agency of @entity107 , was planning to expand its star ratings , already in use on its ' @entity111 ' website			0
he also said @entity107 was committed to providing detail on estimated out - of - pocket costs ' to the extent feasible ' and had developed many internal procedures , although @entity11 said it had found no evidence that was the case			1
in the study , @entity11 compared data on @entity20 ' websites with that of third - party vendors providing similar information on gallbladder surgery , magnetic resonance imaging , or @entity126 , of the lower back and maternity care			1
they also examined documents and interviewed company and government officials and experts on best practices			0
in all , the audit found wide variation in charges for the same medical procedures in the same geographic area regardless of quality â€“ information it said was not readily available on the @entity20 sites			2
@entity104 said there were challenges in providing cost information			0
in addition , the @entity20 sites often lacked critical data on quality of care , such as patient - reported outcomes on common procedures such as a colonoscopy , according to the report			2
consumer reports toaster ratings for life - and - death decisions : the government boils down nursing homes ' critical performance metrics to ' star ' ratings like those given to small appliances nursing home or warehouse ? what will it cost after coverage pays its share ? government websites that are supposed to help consumers make difficult end - of - life choices often fall far short of expectations in interviews with the @entity11 , @entity20 officials said they plan to add patient - reported outcomes on a number of medical procedures			1
the investigators cited a likelihood of continuing problems despite the government 's 2011 pledge under the @entity184 to provide consumers complete and understandable information			0
while @entity20 has said it will make improvements , @entity11 pointed to limitations due in part to resistance from medical providers			2
in recent months , the @entity192 has opposed @entity5 's release of billing records for 880,000 physicians , citing the danger of data being reported inaccurately or taken out of context ; much of that information was eventually released			0
' people deserve to know information on the cost and quality of the health care services they need , ' said @entity208 @entity207 sen. @entity206 , one of the lawmakers who requested the report			0
' the new @entity11 study makes important recommendations on how to better empower consumers , and i look forward to working with this bipartisan group of senators to establish more transparency .			0

@entity20 , same agency that runs @entity62 , flunks test
@entity11 found it 's virtually impossible for consumers to get accurate , reliable information
biggest lapse is in showing *taxpayers* what out - of - pocket costs will be for various services *including* nursing and hospice care , surgeries and @entity126
