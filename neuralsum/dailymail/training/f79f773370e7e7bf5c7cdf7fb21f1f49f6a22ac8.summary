by @entity0 @entity1 believes that by confronting the issue of pregorexia , @entity2 could help many expectant mothers @entity2 's ongoing ' pregorexia ' storyline may be the first time the dangerous condition has ever featured in a @entity10 soap			1
but for the many thousands of women around the country carrying babies while in the grip of anorexia and bulimia , it 's a constant battle that can lead to severe complications and dangerously undernourished babies			1
actress @entity20 , whose character @entity21 is currently going through the eating disorder one in 14 pregnant women suffers from , is glad she 's raising awareness of what is essentially a mental disorder			1
' @entity27 is a dangerous condition , ' says the 35 - year - old , ' yet most people have never heard of it			1
i do n't think it 's taken as seriously as many other mental illnesses - but that 's what it is			1
' when you think how many people watch the show we 're really getting the message out there			1
i 've had lots of lovely letters from people with the condition saying they feel they can be more open about it now it 's out there			1
it 's wonderful to think the storyline might be making a positive difference to viewers ' lives			1
i just wanted to portray it as accurately as i could			2
' @entity1 researched the condition in detail , speaking to psychotherapists and reading sufferers ' accounts			1
and what she uncovered shocked her - a study by @entity64 found seven per cent of pregnant @entity10 women have a full - blown eating disorder , while a quarter are highly concerned about their weight , placing their life , and that of their unborn child , at risk			1
@entity1 's research has helped her realistic portrayal of @entity21 , who 's seven months pregnant and obsessed with avoiding food and making herself sick after meals			1
' i threw myself into it to help me get into sufferers ' mindsets			2
it 's been challenging , with lots of scenes that take it out of you			2
but i feel passionate about it			2
' while @entity1 , nominated for @entity91 at next month 's @entity92 , has always been slim , thankfully she 's never suffered an eating disorder herself			1
though that does n't mean the actress , who has previously stripped down to her underwear for racy photoshoots and sex scenes , is without self - doubt			2
@entity20 on set with @entity100 ( right ) and @entity101 ( left ) ' oh , i 'm as insecure as every other girl , ' she says			2
' i 'm the biggest worrier			0
i 'll do a shoot and think , “ oh @entity105 , was that alright ? ” i pull myself apart the same as anyone			0
' aside from that , @entity1 , who 's just signed on with the @entity109 soap for another year , says she 's having the time of her life			1
the only thing missing , though , is a man to share it with			0
' i 'm in my 30s and , while being single is fun , it would be nice to meet someone			0
i 'm in a great place career-wise , so that would be the icing on the cake			0
@entity21 likes a bad boy , but i definitely do n't want one - i 'm ready to meet a great guy who 'll be my best friend			0
' yes , i 'm super busy , constantly running between my home in @entity127 and my mum 's place in @entity130 , but if you want to be with someone enough you 'll make it work			0
i would n't let anything stand in the way			0
' @entity136 or @entity137 ? @entity136 is perfect for winter sun and relaxation			0
juice or cola ? i do n't drink alcohol so i 'm obsessed with fresh juices - i try to have one every morning			0
@entity144 or @entity145 ? @entity145 is incredible - every film , every character he plays , he nails			0
@entity149 or @entity150 ? i like all kinds of music , but i 've been loving @entity149 's new album @entity154 lately			0
@entity155 or @entity156 ? my family all play @entity156 at @entity158 - it gets everyone thinking and is such fun			0
4x4 or a sports car ? i really like the @entity163 - it 's a 4x4 with a sleek look for women.winding down with friends or a spa weekend ? i love a catch - up at mine with a movie and food .			0
