@entity0 at @entity1 in south - western @entity2 will lose one of their four hot meals starting this saturday , according to @entity0 officials			1
the camp will lose the midnight ration service , known as ' midrats ' , the one meal of the day where all the troops gather together to eat			1
the meal serves as breakfast for the @entity0 at the beginning of their midnight - to - midday shift , and dinner for those coming off their midday - to - midnight shift			1
the idea of forgoing their hot meal rankles with some , including one @entity0 who declined to be named , whose email to his wife was shared with @entity26			1
not quite home - cooked : an @entity28 ) , which are now replacing some hot meals at bases in @entity2 ' this boils my skin , ' he wrote			1
' one of my entire shifts will go 6.5 hours without a meal			0
if we need to cut back on money i could come up with 100 other places			0
' ' instead , we will target the biggest contributor to morale			0
i must be losing my mind			0
what is our senior leadership thinking ? i just got back from flying my ass off and in a few days , i will not have a meal to replenish me after being away for over nine hours			0
' registered dietitian and captain @entity49 told @entity50 that @entity52 troops will never go hungry , and that the moves are logistical , not budget - related			1
' we would never deprive the soldier of adequate nutrition and that 's just all there is to it , ' she said			0
instead of hot cooked meals , soldiers have access to @entity63 )			2
these pre-packaged meals contain all the energy and nutrients a soldier needs to meet one - third of their @entity68			2
to go : a marine eats a meals , ready to eat ( @entity28 ) breakfast , which contains one - third of the @entity68 of calories and nutrients for an adult in the military ' when we initially entered @entity79 and @entity2 , soldiers were eating @entity63 every day until we were logistically established			1
once again when we draw down and pull out , we will see a similar trend , ' @entity49 explained			0
' the fact is our force in @entity2 is shrinking fast and all the creature comforts and services deployed military - members have grown accustomed to over the past decade are going to be reduced , ' @entity0 lieutenant colonel @entity86 to @entity26			1
' when serving we are challenged to endure different things - to face different challenges - over time			0
but we 're an odd bunch , we @entity0 - probably no surprise that we 'll complain more about losing the sandwich bar on the way out than we did about getting shot at on the way in			2
' @entity1 is one of a reported 17 bases facing cuts to their hot meals , and families back home are worried about how the lack of hot food will affect morale			1
according to the @entity103 , a @entity28 provides one - third of the @entity104 of vitamins and minerals			0
a typical @entity28 looks like this : ' psychologically , midrats is probably the most important of all the meals because that ’s the big social time - where first ( shift ) crew is coming off and second ( shift ) crew is coming on , ' @entity114 , founder and executive director of @entity116 , the wife of a @entity110 pilot and an advocate for service members and their families told @entity26			1
' that 's where you get the @entity128 , the camaraderie			0
it 's not just the food you 're taking away , it 's their social sustenance			0
' the base , which is located in @entity2 ’s south - western @entity135 , flanked by @entity136 and @entity137 , will also be losing its 24 - hour sandwich bar			2
concerned military advocates and family members recently launched a @entity142 page called breakfast for @entity144 to gather food donations that can be sent to troops in @entity2			2
the page states : ' we are here to help collect and send non-perishable breakfast type foods to the deployed troops on the 17 bases in @entity2 that are not currently serving breakfast ' hot chow ' and midnight chow due to the budget cuts			1
' the loss of cooked meals is n't popular , but it 's a reflection of the huge draw - down of @entity52 troops from the country , where they 've been established for more than 10 years			1
the @entity103 's ' support services ' , such as the people who prepare food , ' need to go home before the people who provide the security which enables those services , ' @entity86 told @entity26			0
' this is a natural outcome of the draw - down process unrelated to sequestration or the ongoing budget issues back in the @entity171			0
' more than 30,000 @entity52 service members will return from @entity2 over the coming months until the @entity52 hands responsibility back to @entity2 forces in 2014 .			2

soldiers at @entity1 have lost the midnight rations , or ' midrats ' , where troops beginning a shift and others ending theirs come together for a hot meal
soldier 's families say it 's bad for morale and camaraderie among troops and others *suggest* the @entity52 is rationing due to *financial* *problems* at home
officials say the cut - backs have nothing to do with budget cuts , but are part of the *gradual* *withdrawal* of @entity52 troops from @entity2
@entity0 will have four prepared meals a day until saturday , when it will be cut to three , and eventually two
