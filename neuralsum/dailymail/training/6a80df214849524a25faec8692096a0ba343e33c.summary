by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 10:07 est , 30 july 2013 a rabbit born with a normal amount of hair has confused doctors after it appeared to show signs of a condition that only exists in dogs			2
@entity8 appeared just to be the runt of the litter when he was born six weeks ago , but when his fur started falling out owner @entity14 from @entity15 , @entity16 , realised something was amiss			1
when she took the pet to the vet , she discovered that he had pituitary dwarfism			1
ms @entity14 , 40 , said : ' i thought he was the runt of the litter with a skin condition			2
i have grown up around rabbits and we have had several litters but i 've never seen anything like @entity8			1
' i worried he was n't eating properly , but he was living and just looked a bit different , especially compared to the other rabbits			0
' after being checked by the vet , he was declared perfectly healthy			0
ms @entity14 said the vet decided not to take a blood sample from the tiny creature as it might make him anaemic , so she has been keeping a close eye on him instead			0
rabbit 's foot : but luck was on @entity8 's side and the little creature has surprised everyone by getting stronger by the day while he remains far smaller than his siblings , the rabbit 's fur has now regrown @entity14 , who bred the unusual looking rabbit , said he has become part of the family and will not be for sale the rabbit 's eyes need bathing every morning to help him open them because they get stuck together over night			1
and when out in the sunshine , @entity8 must be lathered in factor 50 suncream to protect his sensitive skin			2
the rabbit has astounded both his owners and vets by becoming stronger by the day			0
his hair has regrown on his body , but he still has bald patches on his the back of his head and the top of his feet			0
ms @entity14 's son @entity88 , 10 , loves his new pet and after naming him @entity8 when he was born , added ' mouse ' to the end due to his small stature			1
best friends : ten - year - old @entity88 was so afraid to hold the tiny baby bunny when he lost his fur because he seemed so fragile now that @entity8 is on the road to recovery , he likes no where better than sitting on @entity88 's head the ten - year - old has been scared to hold him at times because he is so precious			1
ms @entity14 said : ' he 's thriving and very spritely			0
he 's super friendly and loves to sit on your shoulder			0
' he 's become quite a little celebrity , everyone wants to come round and see him and have their picture taken with him			0
' ms @entity14 's breeding pair @entity108 and @entity109 have produced a number of litters as well as being parents to @entity8			1
a good clean : now that his fur has grown back , @entity8 has to keep it all in order the miniature bunny has settled into the family , who have become completely taken with him while she is hoping to sell the other members of the litter , it 's sure that @entity8 wo n't be going anywhere			1
ms @entity14 , a catering assistant , said : ' @entity8 has become a member of the family , we 're completely taken with him			2
' i think after all we have been through with him , we could n't see him go off to another home			0

@entity8 has pituitary dwarfism which vet had only seen before in dogs
@entity138 thought he *'d* die , but he 's *pulled* through and is quite a character
