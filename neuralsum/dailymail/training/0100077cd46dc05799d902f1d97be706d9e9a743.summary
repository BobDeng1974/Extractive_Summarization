@entity0 believes gay men are knowingly spreading the hiv virus while shaking hands with others using a special ring			1
the host of the @entity7 and founder of the @entity9 made the remarks tuesday and said attacks are most prevalent in cities like @entity13			1
@entity0 said his comments were taken out of context had @entity9 edit them from video posted online , however footage of the former baptist minister ’s odd claims can still be viewed elsewhere on the web			1
a viewer named @entity31 wrote in wondering what to do after she discovered her church had her unknowingly ferrying a man dying of @entity35 to and from sunday school for weeks			0
‘ i feel deceived , ’ @entity31 wrote			0
‘ what if there had been an accident ? ’ @entity0 began by admitting his ignorance in matters of @entity2 transmission			1
like this : @entity0 demonstrates how the rings work to his co-host @entity45 unconvinced : the normally pliant @entity45 was n't even in full agreement and the exchange was edited from the web version of the broadcast			1
however , the full video can still be viewed online ‘ i used to think it was transmitted by saliva and other things , ’ the 83 - year - old said			1
‘ now they say it may be sexual contact			0
’ @entity0 ’s advice to @entity31 was , ‘ do n’t have sex with him			1
’ ‘ but that ’s too simplistic , ’ he continued , ‘ there are laws now , i think the homosexual community has put these draconian laws on the books that prohibit people from discussing this particular affliction , you can tell somebody you had a heart attack , you can tell them they ’ve got high blood pressure , but you ca n’t tell anybody you ’ve got @entity35			0
’ this last remark and those that followed were edited from the video posted to @entity9 ’s website and the @entity81 videos of the full exchange that surfaced were promptly taken down on copyright claims			2
however , @entity85 ’s video of the broadcast remains viewable			0
‘ you know what they do in @entity13 , some in the gay community there they want to get people so if they got the stuff they ’ll have a ring , you shake hands , and the ring ’s got a little thing where you cut your finger , ’ @entity0 said			2
it ’s that kind of vicious stuff , which would be the equivalent of murder			0
’ @entity0 later claimed that what he meant was gays from ‘ years ago , ’ , not gays today			2
‘ our organization sponsored a meeting years ago in @entity13 where trained security officers warned me about shaking hands , ’ he told the @entity107			0
‘ in those days , certain @entity35 - infected activists were deliberately trying to infect people like me by virtue of rings which would cut fingers and transfer blood			0

the @entity7 host has a *history* of *anti-gay* remarks
@entity0 tried *scrubbing* the *internet* of the video , but an edited and *unedited* version can both still be viewed
