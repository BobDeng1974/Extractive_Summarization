the gilded lives of premiership footballers and their families are often a source of fascination : a dizzying whirl of flash cars , sprawling houses , and lurching from one luxury holiday or swanky nightclub to the next			0
yet the material trappings of success mean refreshingly little to @entity13 defender @entity12			1
while many in his position may lavish their children with the sort of lifestyle few can imagine , he is simply concerned with helping his son @entity20 to hold a pen and draw			1
devoted dad : @entity13 defender @entity12 is a hands - on father to help his son @entity20 overcome his eye problem the four - year - old has the sight condition nystagmus , which causes the eyeballs to move uncontrollably – often described as a wobble or flicker			1
it results in a range of problems with vision , balance and co-ordination , depending on the severity			1
those with nystagmus may have trouble negotiating uneven ground or stairs as their depth of perception can be impaired			2
children may need extra time for reading and exams to allow their eyes to focus			0
and if you ’re dining with a sufferer , it will probably take them longer to peruse a menu			0
@entity12 knows his son will never follow him into elite sports , or even hold a driving licence			1
yet he and his wife @entity59 , 31 , are absolutely determined that the condition will never stop @entity20 from being a success			1
true defender : @entity12 , pictured during a match between @entity13 and @entity64 , has recently become a patron for a nystagmus charity - a condition which affects up to 125,000 @entity68 ‘ although @entity20 ’s eyes are n’t the same as other children ’s , he does n’t need to wear glasses and is doing all the things he should at his age , ’ says proud father @entity12 , who recently became patron of the charity @entity70			1
‘ he ’s inquisitive and he loves to draw pictures and read books , both of which encourage his eyes to focus			0
he can hold a pen nicely and writes really well			2
’ like all new parents , he and @entity59 were besotted with @entity20 the moment he was born in april 2009			1
but one thing concerned them – when @entity20 tentatively opened his eyes for the first time , his eyeballs wobbled constantly from side to side			1
‘ the midwife and health visitor told us he was probably just learning to focus and not to worry , ’ says @entity12 , who was playing for @entity90 at the time			1
‘ but when @entity59 took him for his three - month check - up , she saw a different health visitor who picked up on it straight away and asked if @entity20 had nystagmus			1
’ @entity12 was in @entity100 for pre-season training but flew home immediately to be with @entity59 while @entity20 had more tests with an ophthalmologist in @entity105			1
like many of us , the couple had never heard of the condition before then			2
yet nystagmus is common – it is estimated it affects up to 125,000 @entity68			2
typically , children are born with the condition , although adults can also develop it due to injury or illness			2
it is incurable , and varies in how much visual impairment it causes , but usually does n’t get worse after childhood			0
sight will be blurred , with poor distance vision			1
historically , those with nystagmus – and , for that matter , most other serious visual impairments – were excluded socially			2
statistics provided by the @entity128 reveal that in 2004 , nine out of ten employers rated blind and partially sighted people as either ‘ difficult ’ or ‘ impossible ’ to employ			0
blurred lines : sufferers of nystagmus often have an impaired depth of perception , needing extra time to read and write to allow their eyes to focus a study two years later concluded that nearly half of blind and partially sighted people felt ‘ moderately ’ or ‘ completely ’ cut off from people and things around them			2
another report in 2012 showed that two - thirds of working - age people with sight problems experience ‘ restriction in being able to access and fully participate in employment ’			1
such statistics make grim reading			0
but they disguise the fact that a major sea change has taken place in recent decades , as @entity156 , trustee of @entity70 and himself a sufferer , has found			0
‘ as a child , i was sent to a special school for partially sighted kids , which gave out the message that we would n’t be able to achieve the same things in life as those without sight problems , ’ he says			1
‘ that changed in the 1980s when it was realised that , with the right practical support , children with nystagmus could thrive in mainstream schools and should be given the chance to do so			2
‘ now that diagnosis frequently happens in infancy and parents are provided with support for their children , we see countless sufferers go on to achieve university degrees and professional careers in the likes of banking and the civil service			0
’ @entity188 is a complex condition with numerous variants , though essentially there are two types			0
it can be present from birth or acquired later as a result of a head injury , stroke or brain tumour			0
it also commonly occurs in people with albinism			0
experts think the involuntary movement of the eyeball occurs because the sensors in the brain that control eye movements are malfunctioning			1
many patients will have impaired vision requiring glasses or contact lenses – although these wo n’t correct the blurring that nystagmus causes			1
those with severe problems will need to register as partially sighted or blind , and many will never be able to drive patients may benefit from medication			0
the epilepsy drug gabapentin and the neuroprotective drug memantine can help reduce eye movement , but they do n’t work for everyone			1
surgery works well and involves weakening two of the eye muscles by moving them further back on the eye , while shortening the two opposite muscles to strengthen them			0
a newer operation removes and reattaches extraocular muscles – each eye has six extraocular muscles which work to move the eyes in different directions of gaze			0

one of the experts @entity12 ’s son saw recently is @entity240 , professor of ophthalmology at @entity242 and a consultant at @entity244			1
she agrees that optimism is key and that it ’s highly unlikely @entity20 ’s condition will worsen as he gets older			1
‘ on the contrary , ’ she says			0
‘ in babies the eyes move wildly at first , but this calms down in the first two years as they learn to control and focus their eyes , just as in @entity20 ’s case			1
the condition should settle down further between now and his teenage years and is unlikely to deteriorate after that			0
children with the condition should be encouraged to live as normal a life as possible			0
‘ in most patients their nystagmus is “ quietest ” when they look in a certain direction			0
this is the position at which it ’s easiest for them to see well			0
if the nystagmus is quietest to the right , the patient will naturally turn their head to the left so they can turn their eyes to the right where their vision is best			1
’ @entity12 and @entity59 have worked hard to dramatically improve @entity20 ’s condition			1
‘ under the guidance of our consultant , we did daily exercise sessions at home for the first two years of @entity20 ’s life using special light cubes in a darkened room to encourage his eyes to focus and track the light , ’ @entity12 explains			1
‘ before that , if we moved a toy in front of him or waved our hands he did n’t respond			0
but we noticed a big improvement quite quickly			0
’ @entity20 has been going to nursery at the school where his big sister @entity291 , six , is a pupil , and he will start reception class there next month			1
‘ as a parent , the one word you do n’t want to hear is that your child is coping at school , ’ @entity12 continues			2
‘ coping is n’t good enough – you want them to thrive			0
‘ it ’s simple things that will make a huge difference to @entity20 ’s confidence and development at school , such as having a coat peg at a height he can focus on , and a seat that affords him a good view of the teacher and the board – all of which we ’ve put in place with the school			2
‘ our greatest hope is that @entity20 can achieve his maximum potential in whatever it is that interests him or he is good at , and that he develops into a happy and confident young man			2
' my biggest concern is that he does n’t suffer socially because of his constant eye wobble			0
kids can be very cruel if they spot that there ’s something different about another child			0
’ for @entity20 , it ’s now a case of having check - ups every three months and doing the things that most other little boys love to do , such as spending the summer holidays enjoying rough and tumble and a game of football in the garden with his dad .			2
