@entity0 , 53 , has been found guilty of cheating his brother out of a £ 1.5million inheritance a jealous son has been found guilty of faking his family member 's signatures to cheat his older brother out of a £ 1.5million inheritance - because he was fed up with him being the ' favourite '			1
@entity0 , 53 , resented his brother @entity9 moving to @entity10 and then @entity11 - leaving him to look after their ailing mother - so he siphoned off cash from their parents ' estate			1
@entity0 , as an executor to a number of trusts and settlements , wound them up by forging the signatures of his mother @entity24 , or 55 - year - old brother @entity9			1
he also cashed in two life insurance policies , worth just under £ 100,000 altogether , before pocketing the money			1
the family estate should have been split equally between @entity0 and his brother , but he transferred cash into a joint account , set up between himself and his mother , then moved it into a sole account in his name			1
the cash was then handed to former partners and was used to buy a 40 per cent stake in an online gaming company , set up by a relative of his wife			1
but the ploy unfolded when @entity24 died in november 2011 aged 81			1
@entity9 discovered his brother 's deception during a conversation with family lawyers about funds			2
@entity0 was arrested and charged with four counts of fraud			0
he was also jointly charged with his wife @entity1 , 51 , on another			0
yesterday a jury took just three and a half hours to return guilty verdicts on all five counts			0
they found his wife not guilty			0
@entity54 , prosecuting , told the four - week trial : ' it is a sad case because it is a case about a breakdown in a family , and who knows what lies behind it			0
' @entity0 may well have thought , " my brother is off living his life in @entity10 or @entity11 , i 'm stuck here with mum , i will take what i can get my hands on "			2
' particularly if he has some money to settle with former partners and particularly if he wants to make some money out of online gambling			0
' there is some talk of @entity9 always being the favourite son , and @entity0 and @entity24 having a very difficult relationship			1
' but what is overwhelmingly obvious in this case is that he practised deceit , in one case he was knowingly assisted by his wife in order to take money he knew he was not entitled to , otherwise he would not have behaved as he did			0
' effectively @entity0 was taking for himself all of her [ @entity24 ] money in the last days of her life , although he knew full well that it was her intention that both the boys should benefit equally from their hard earned money			1
' the total sums are just in excess of £ 1.5million			0
' @entity88 heard @entity0 first came into contact with the family accounts when his father @entity91 , set up a number of trusts in 2002 - shortly before he died			1
a letter was sent to both brothers where they were told proceeds of the estate , upon the deaths of both @entity91 and @entity24 , ' should be divided equally between them '			2
@entity0 was given the responsibility for dealing with the administration of the trusts following his father @entity91 ' death in august 2004			2
he wound up one settlement , giving half the proceeds , some £ 109,000 , to his brother in @entity10 , convincing him the rest of the money was still in the trusts			2
but @entity0 began to look into other accounts where he faked his mother 's signature on an @entity116 document enabling him to access the money , before purporting she had signed another to close a settlement			0
@entity88 heard that @entity0 , as an executor to a number of trusts and settlements , wound them up by forging the signatures of his mother @entity24 , or 55 - year - old brother @entity9 the court was told that @entity128 , knowing about the deception , then countersigned the settlement document , so the money would be released			1
around the same time @entity24 suffered a fall at the family home in @entity134 , @entity135 in 2009 and her health deteriorated dramatically , forcing her to move in with the couple in @entity138 , @entity139			0
@entity0 quickly set up an online joint account , and transferred all the proceeds of the policies and settlements into it			1
bank statements later show the money being moved to an account in his name only before being withdrawn as cash or cheques			0
@entity151 set in motion plans to sell the childhood house , and once he had received permission from @entity9 , via email , sold the home for £ 1.075million , moving all the money from the sale from @entity24 's account into the joint e-saver			1
@entity9 never received proceeds of the sale			0
' this is not a case that a woman who had lost her mental faculties was exploited , ' mr @entity54 told the court			0
' mentally , although difficult and showing inadvertent signs of ageing , @entity24 was competent , which explains why @entity0 felt it necessary to resort to fraud , including forging signatures , in order to get his hands on the money to which he was not entitled to			2
' this e-saving account was really a vehicle through which @entity0 enabled himself to get his hands on his mum 's money			0
' @entity24 's various personal accounts were almost always running at a very small balance , and whenever a very significant amount of money was credited it was immediately received to the joint account before it was removed by @entity0 for his own gain			2
' it was only when @entity24 died , on november 14 2010 and emails were sent between the family solicitor and @entity9 regarding family trusts , that he discovered what his brother had done			1
the court heard independent handwriting experts had confirmed the signatures were not those of @entity24 , or @entity197 , something @entity0 does not deny			2
the case has been adjourned for sentencing at a later date .			0
