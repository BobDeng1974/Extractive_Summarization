@entity0 has revealed @entity2 ’s brutal pre-season training regime is responsible for the second wind that has lifted @entity4 up the table			1
late goals are becoming a blessing for a side that has so far been distinctly underwhelming , with @entity0 rescuing his side with a last - minute strike in the 2 - 1 win at @entity12 on sunday			1
it was an almost identical scenario when he sank @entity15 in late november , with @entity4 so far benefiting from four goals in the last five minutes of @entity18 fixtures this season			1
only @entity20 have snatched more			2
@entity4 midfielder @entity0 celebrates scoring a late winner against @entity12 @entity4 's @entity24 ( left ) , @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity23 celebrate their 89th - minute winner the impact on @entity4 ’s league position has been enormous , with nine points coming directly from their late shows , not to mention wednesday 's @entity31 quarter - final against @entity32 , which follows a two - goal salvo at the end of their third - round win over @entity37			1
@entity2 was quick to praise his side ’s character after the @entity41 win , but @entity0 is convinced the fast finishes are derived from a hard summer following the @entity45 's arrival			1
‘ pre-season was the toughest i ’ve experienced , ’ he said			2
‘ the gaffer worked the players really hard			2
‘ but i think it is paying off now			0
of course we are tired after games , that is normal , but as you see with us in the last few weeks we are able to go 100 per cent again and again at the end of the games			0
before we would n't have been fit enough to go the whole game			0
@entity0 ( left ) scored a late winner for @entity4 as they took all three points away from the @entity41 ‘ obviously there will be periods when the other team have the ball and you have to play differently			1
but in the end we have the confidence and power to keep going for 90 minutes			0
‘ we always seem to get that feeling late in a game when we can really go for it			2
we seemed to get more confident late in the game			2
’ @entity0 added : ‘ it does n’t matter how or when you win but i think everybody would rather win a bit earlier - although it would n’t be as exciting			1
‘ but the win at @entity12 proves we have a lot of belief in the squad			1
once again we showed our character and got over the line			0
’ @entity80 home the winner for @entity4 as they left the @entity41 with all three points @entity4 were again far from impressive in beating @entity12 , with @entity0 concerned that they are not performing consistently in a campaign that has already seen them beaten six times in the league			1
‘ we are where we are , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s so close in the league at the moment			0
you get a win and you are right up there where you want to be			0
and if you lose you are down where you do n’t want to be			0
at the moment we are in between			0
‘ we certainly need to be more consistent but we are going the right way			0
’ @entity0 points to the sky as he runs off in celebration having netted an 89th - minute winner @entity101 celebrates with @entity0 after the @entity102 secured the points for his side			1
