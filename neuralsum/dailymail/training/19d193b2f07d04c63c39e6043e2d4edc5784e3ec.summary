by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 20:07 est , 17 july 2013 @entity2 magnate @entity1 is facing the prospect of extradition after being indicted by a @entity6 court on bribery charges			2
the 82 - year - old billionaire could be jailed for five years if convicted			1
prosecutors allege that a £ 26million payment by the motorsport boss to @entity6 banker @entity12 was made to ensure that a large stake of @entity2 was sold below its true value in 2006 to mr @entity1 ’s preferred bidder			1
mr @entity1 , left , had been under investigation since former @entity6 banker @entity12 , right , was convicted of corruption for receiving payments from the motor racing chief executive in connection with the sale of shares in the sport in 2006 but he denies the sum was a bribe , instead claiming he was being blackmailed by the banker over untrue tax allegations that could have cost him ‘ billions ’			1
@entity12 was jailed for accepting the payment and is serving an eight - and - a - half year sentence			1
mr @entity1 gave evidence during the banker ’s trial , admitting that he gave him large sums of money , but denied doing anything illegal			1
now he has been served with an indictment by a @entity6 judge , and will either have to answer voluntarily to the charges or be threatened with extradition			0
mr @entity1 ’s team is planning to send a response to the judge within the next few weeks			1
after the defence has been weighed against the prosecution case , the judge will decide whether to summon him for a court hearing			0
court action : the tycoon 's legal team will submit a response within the next few weeks and prosecutors will then decide whether mr @entity1 could face trial he strenuously denies the allegation – but questions are being raised over whether he can continue his dominance of motor racing as @entity2 ’s chief executive with the charges hanging over him			1
mr @entity1 told the @entity60 yesterday : ‘ i have just spoken to my lawyers and they have received an indictment			1
it ’s being translated into @entity63			0
we are defending it properly			0
it will be an interesting case			0
it ’s a pity it ’s happened			0
’ mr @entity1 said it was ‘ inevitable ’ that the indictment had been issued against him , saying : ‘ if someone wants to sue you , they can do it and you have to defend it			1
’ @entity12 is alleged to have received the £ 26million during a huge sale of @entity2 shares in 2006			0
he worked for state - owned @entity76 , which was selling its 48 per cent share in the motor racing company , and he was a major figure in arranging the sale			0
at his trial in @entity83 in 2011 , the disgraced banker admitted corruptly receiving bank commissions and large payments from an @entity1 family trust			2
big business : mr @entity1 had claimed that the £ 29million payment was to avoid a @entity90 tax inquiry into the sale of @entity2 in 2006 and vehemently denied that they were bribes he claimed the cash was in return for ensuring the shares were sold to @entity96 , a private equity firm , because it would keep mr @entity1 as the controller of @entity2			2
but the motorsport boss insisted he had been ‘ pressured ’ into paying because @entity12 had threatened to make false allegations to the @entity90 taxman that an @entity1 family trust in the tax haven of @entity103 was fully in @entity1 ’s control			0
mr @entity1 claims he did not have control of the trust , so was not evading tax			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

mr @entity1 had been under investigation since banker @entity12 was jailed
the charges are said to be based on statements from mr @entity12
mr @entity1 's lawyers *confirmed* the indictment is being translated
the 82 - year - old 's team will respond to @entity83 prosecutors in weeks
