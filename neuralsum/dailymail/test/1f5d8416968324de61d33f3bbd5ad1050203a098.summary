the state of @entity1 has removed protection for gay people who use ride - sharing services @entity5 and @entity6			0
initially , the @entity7 included language that prohibited the companies from discriminating against customers based on sexual orientation or gender identity			1
however , sen. @entity13 has revealed he rewrote the bill to eliminate that language and allow private businesses to establish their own policies regarding discrimination			1
controversy : uber drivers in @entity1 now have a right to refuse gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender customers who use the ride - sharing app ' i believe if a private business owner wants to serve or not serve an individual , they have that purview right now , ' said @entity13 , a @entity32			1
the new version of the bill faced fierce criticism from sen. @entity36 , a @entity37 who tried unsuccessfully to amend the measure			2
he attempted to add requirements that any driver who wishes to discriminate against a customer based on sexual orientation or gender identity must advertise their intent on their vehicle and on the company 's website			2
' why should you be able to discriminate ? ' @entity48 said			2
' we 're talking about a level of civil conduct in the marketplace			0
society has figured out that when you enter the marketplace , you should have an expectation of being treated fairly			0
' @entity5 and @entity6 , among the most popular ridesharing programs , already have policies in place that prohibit discrimination against customers based on sexual orientation or gender identity			0
' @entity5 's policy is to serve every neighborhood , every driver and every person who needs a ride , ' company spokeswoman @entity64 said			0
rewritten : @entity32 sen. @entity13 ( pictured ) rewrote the bill to give drivers the option to discriminate the company will continue to enforce its current terms of service , ' which make clear that discrimination in any form is not tolerated and will result in removal from the platform , ' she said			1
@entity82 , executive director of @entity83 , said in a statement that the group does not ' understand why a member of the @entity87 wants to remove protections for [ lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ] @entity89 from a bill that is specific to an industry that already protects them , in their corporate policies			0
@entity89 do not believe in discrimination , and it is time for ideological law makers to quit trying to distract from the real problems of our state by attacking the @entity105 community			1

initially , the @entity108 bill included language that protected @entity105 users
but senator @entity13 rewrote the bill to allow drivers to discriminate
