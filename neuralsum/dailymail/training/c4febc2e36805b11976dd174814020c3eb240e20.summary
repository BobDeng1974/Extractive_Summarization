since 2010 there has been a spectacular fall in the number sent home after committing serious offences here			2
in the year of the general election , 5,342 were deported			1
in 2011 , in the @entity10 ’s second year of office , the figure was down 13 per cent to 4,649			2
broken : the prime minister has failed to deport foreign criminals as he promised figures from the first three quarters of 2012 show that 3,382 were deported			1
if the trend continued in the final quarter , it would mean the 2012 total is around 4,509 – again , down on the previous year , and 16 per cent down on the election year figure			1
last year the number of foreign prisoners in our jails went up			2
the number stood at 10,861 as of june 2012 , up from 10,779 the year before			2

@entity34 ’s justice spokesman @entity33 , who obtained the figures , said : ‘ @entity2 ’s promises to send back thousands of foreign prisoners and to take a personal interest in this matter ring hollow			1
‘ not only has he failed to send more prisoners home , but the number in our prisons has actually risen			0
‘ over half a billion pounds a year is now spent on keeping foreign prisoners in our prisons , and because of @entity2 ’s failings , money that would be better spent elsewhere in our justice system to keep our communities safe is being wasted			1
