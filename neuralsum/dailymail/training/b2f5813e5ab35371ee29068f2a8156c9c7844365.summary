@entity0 set the platform for a final - day push for victory in the fourth test against @entity5 after establishing a 348 - run lead with four wickets remaining in @entity8			1
after bowling out @entity5 for 475 in the afternoon session to establish a first - innings advantage of 97 , @entity0 's batsmen then went on the offensive as the hosts blazed their way to 251 for six by the close			2
in - form captain @entity16 ( 71 ) and opener @entity17 ( 56 ) laid the foundations before newcomer @entity20 smashed 66 off 39 balls to leave @entity0 in a strong position to try and seal a 3 - 0 series victory			1
@entity16 scored 71 as @entity0 looked to set up a final day victory @entity25 ( four for 105 ) was the most successful of the @entity5 bowlers but did not escape the onslaught either as @entity0 progressed at almost six and a half runs an over			1
@entity25 had , at least , been able to frustrate @entity0 with the bat earlier , making 50 as the tourists battled their way to 475 all out at the @entity31 after starting the morning on 342 for five			2
it was not such a good day for @entity5 captain @entity33 , though			0
striding out to the middle , @entity33 would have hoped to make considerable additions to his overnight 140 but he could add only seven before falling in the fifth over of the day , caught by @entity17 at midwicket off @entity38			2
@entity40 's exit was not much better as @entity41 found some bounce and the wicketkeeper was caught in two minds as he top - edged to @entity16 at slip to exit for 35			2
@entity46 , the bowler who bowled the fatal ball to @entity48 , was the 12th man at the @entity31 @entity46 carries drinks during day four of the fourth test match between @entity0 and @entity5 @entity20 put down a tough chance to dismiss new man @entity52 and he and @entity25 managed to steer the tourists through to lunch just seven down			1
and the pair put on a battling 65 to further frustrate @entity0 before @entity52 fell for 30 in controversial fashion			0
@entity59 's ball appeared to pitch in the same place as the bat hit the ground with the ball going to @entity64 at slip			0
there was a slight appeal and when the umpires went upstairs , the wicket was given			0
@entity25 then brought up his fourth @entity70 off 110 balls but fell to the next one he faced as @entity72 found the edge and @entity74 gobbled up the chance behind the stumps			0
storm clouds gather over the ground during day four in @entity8 @entity5 's cricketer @entity79 ( right ) shouts for a decision against @entity81 batsman @entity17 @entity82 hammered 14 off the next over as @entity5 crept within a hundred of the @entity81 first innings and @entity85 ( four ) got them there with a boundary before top - edging @entity38 to @entity74 to leave @entity88 stranded on 16			1
that left the tourists with a deficit of 97 but they got off to an excellent start in the field as @entity25 found @entity95 's edge and @entity96 took a catch at slip to remove the opener for four			0
the hosts reached 38 for one at tea but @entity64 was gone shortly after as @entity25 found the edge again but this time it was the bottom edge as the all - rounder chopped on for 16			0
@entity0 were looking to attack and @entity16 hit four fours in an over as the lead raced past 200			1
former @entity81 bowler @entity108 jokes with guests while visiting the @entity110 @entity16 then hit an enormous six off @entity25 before @entity17 reached a half - century for the sixth consecutive innings but he was gone five balls later , pulling @entity52 to @entity79 at deep square leg for 56			1
@entity16 registered his own fifty off just 44 balls with a four before @entity115 fell for just one , edging a beauty from @entity25 to @entity96 at slip			0
wickets were not halting home momentum , though , as the @entity81 kept the rate up but @entity16 was next to go for 71 , trapped in front by @entity88			2
with the captain gone having taken his run tally in the series to a phenomenal 769 , @entity20 and @entity74 took matters into their own hands , finding the boundary almost at will and hammering sixes in three consecutive overs to take the lead past 300			0
@entity20 was the last wicket of the day to fall having made his second 50 of the match when he top - edged a sweep off @entity25 in what turned out to be the last over , but by then @entity0 had already batted themselves into a powerful position .			1

@entity0 have a 348 - run lead going into the final day
@entity16 scored 71 and @entity17 hit 56
@entity46 was the 12th man during the match
