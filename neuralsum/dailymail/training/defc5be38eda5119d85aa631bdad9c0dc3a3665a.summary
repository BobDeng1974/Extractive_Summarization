by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was informed by @entity3 last week that he will start against @entity4 on wednesday and has applauded the man - management style of the @entity7 manager			1
@entity3 ’s inclusive approach is in contrast to the @entity10 four years ago when @entity12 ’s three goalkeepers did not know who would start the opening group game , against the @entity15 , until shortly before the kick - off			1
it was @entity18 who got the nod but made an awful mistake which allowed @entity21 to equalise and became the enduring image of a miserable campaign			2
chance to impress : @entity2 will start for @entity7 in their @entity10 warm - up game against @entity4 established : @entity2 is the regular back - up to first - choice @entity7 goalkeeper @entity26 ' i knew that last week that i ’d be playing this game , so i could tailor my week to get ready for it , ' said @entity2 , the @entity30 goalkeeper , who will start his first @entity7 game for nearly four years			1
' it ’s different for an outfield player because they do all their work separately , ' he added			0
' for a goalkeeper , it ’s important you know you ’re playing , not only for how you tailor your training and gym work , but also mentally			0
' it ’s the same with your clubs , if you know you are playing week in week out , you can tailor everything around			0
' @entity3 is very good with that , very open , a very personable person			1
he ’s more than happy to pull people and have a chat with things and explain things in a very reasonable way			2
' @entity2 was watching on television when @entity18 allowed @entity21 ’s low shot to slither through his hands in @entity54 , @entity55 , four years ago			1
' i was gutted for him , ' said the @entity30 keeper			0
' he ’s a fantastic guy , a really nice man			0
it ’s a real shame			0
i do n’t know if it was being sprung at the last minute on him			0
' a @entity10 is a big deal , with a lot of pressure but he dealt with it and has bounced back , promoted with @entity66			2
' inclusive : @entity2 has praised @entity3 's approach to management compared to other managers			1

@entity2 ready to start in @entity10 warm - up game against @entity4
@entity7 *no.* 2 praises management style of @entity3
happy to play second fiddle to @entity26 under @entity3 's expert *guidance*
