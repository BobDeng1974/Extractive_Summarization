danger : older people with moderately low blood levels of vitamin d are up to two - thirds more at risk of contracting dementia or @entity6 's in later life older people with low vitamin d levels were more than twice as likely to develop any kind of dementia , warn researchers			1
an international team , led by dr @entity14 at the @entity15 , found people who were severely deficient were up to 125 per cent more at risk of dementia or @entity6 ’s			1
those with moderately low blood levels of vitamin d were up to two - thirds more at risk			2
it is the first large study to investigate the relationship between vitamin d and dementia where the diagnosis was made by an expert team using neuroimaging and other tests			2
previous research suggests people with low vitamin d levels are more likely to go on to experience cognitive problems , but this study confirms a link to a higher risk of alzheimer ’s disease and dementia			1
the team studied 1,658 @entity37 aged 65 and over who were able to walk unaided and were free from dementia , cardiovascular disease and stroke			0
the participants were then followed for six years to see who went on to develop @entity6 ’s and other forms of dementia			1
those who were moderately deficient in vitamin d had a 53 per cent increased risk of developing dementia of any kind , and the risk increased to 125 per cent in severely deficient people			1
similar results were recorded for @entity6 ’s disease , with the moderately deficient group 69 per cent more likely to develop this type of dementia , jumping to a 122 per cent increased risk for those severely deficient			1
it found a link with higher dementia rates when vitamin d levels fell to the lowest level , as well as a threshold for good health			2
the findings show when blood levels fall below 50 nanomol ( nmol ) of vitamin per liter of serum , the risk starts to increase			0
@entity72 levels above 50 nmol / l are most strongly associated with good brain health , says the study published in the journal @entity76			0
dr @entity14 said : “ we expected to find an association between low @entity72 levels and the risk of dementia and alzheimer ’s disease , but the results were surprising – we actually found that the association was twice as strong as we anticipated			0
‘ clinical trials are now needed to establish whether eating foods such as oily fish or taking vitamin d supplements can delay or even prevent the onset of alzheimer ’s disease and dementia			2
‘ we need to be cautious and our latest results do not demonstrate that low vitamin d levels cause dementia			0
trials : almost 2,000 elderly people were surveyed by the @entity15 for six years ‘ that said , our findings are very encouraging , and even if a small number of people could benefit , this would have enormous public health implications given the devastating and costly nature of dementia			1
’ the body makes most of its vitamin d from sunlight on the skin , but older people can be less efficient at converting uv exposure			0
although the vitamin is found in oily fish , and is routinely added to milk , diet accounts for very little of the nutrient that actually makes it into the bloodstream			0
prof @entity120 , @entity121 of @entity122 , @entity123 of @entity124 , @entity125 , said ‘ this study confirms the suggestion from previous research that there is a link between low vitamin d levels and the risk of developing alzheimer ’s disease and dementia			2
action : researchers urge health officials to prioritise treatment trials in people with low levels of vitamin d to see if supplements could prevent the onset ‘ it emphasises the need for treatment trials in people with low levels of vitamin d to see if supplements could prevent or delay the onset of dementia , or improve memory function after it has deteriorated			1
‘ one could make a case for checking vitamin d levels in older people who have a poor diet , or who have little exposure to the sun , or alternatively as a part of an older persons ’ routine screening programme , because vitamin d is important for other health reasons as well as memory problems and dementia			1
‘ dementia is such a devastating disease that preventing or slowing down its progression , if this proves possible with vitamin d supplements , would be extremely important even if the number of people who benefited seems small			1
’ dr @entity173 , director of research and development at @entity176 charity , said ‘ during this hottest of summers , hitting the beach for just 15 minutes of sunshine is enough to boost your vitamin d levels			0
‘ however , we ’re not quite ready to say that sunlight or vitamin d supplements will reduce your risk of dementia			1
‘ large scale clinical trials are needed to determine whether increasing vitamin d levels in those with deficiencies can help prevent dementia from developing			0
’ dr @entity194 , @entity195 at @entity197 charity , said the research showed a link between low vitamin d and dementia , but not that it was the cause			0
‘ to be certain whether increasing vitamin d could help protect against dementia , we would need to see large - scale clinical trials			0
‘ anyone who is considering changing their diet to include vitamin supplements should speak to a doctor			0
‘ in the meantime , there are a number of ways people can lower their risk of dementia , including eating a healthy , balanced diet , exercising regularly , not smoking or drinking too much , and keeping blood pressure and weight in check			2

@entity15 surveyed 2,000 *pensioners* for 6 years
those who were moderately deficient in vitamin d had 53 **%** risk of dementia
@entity229 increased to 125 **%** in severely deficient people , same for @entity6 's
researchers urge health officials to start trialling supplements for elderly
