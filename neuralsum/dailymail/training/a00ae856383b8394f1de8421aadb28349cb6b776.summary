it ’s the happy ending that @entity1 the blind great dane and her trusty friend turned guide dog @entity4 deserve			1
when the @entity7 featured the heart - warming tale of the two great danes , who were looking for a new home , more than 2,000 dog lovers responded by offering to take them			0
now @entity1 and @entity4 are moving from the @entity13 in @entity14 to live with the @entity16 family 35 miles away in @entity17 , @entity18			1
happy ending : @entity16 and his wife @entity20 with blind @entity1 and her guide dog @entity4			2
the couple have taken in the two dogs after reading about them in the @entity7 @entity1 , six , was barely a puppy when she was struck down by a condition that caused her eyelashes to grow into her eyeballs , damaging them beyond repair			1
thankfully her friend @entity4 , seven , became her new eyes and led her everywhere			0
the two have become inseparable and @entity1 follows @entity4 , almost touching her as they walk so she knows where to go			2
but in july their owner could no longer cope with them and they were sent to the re-homing centre			0
forever friends : @entity1 , left , being guided while walking with @entity4 right			2
the pair have been inseparable since @entity1 lost her sight @entity41 , 52 , and her husband @entity16 , 53 , a retired fireman , fell in love with the dogs when they read about them in the @entity7 and their offer was accepted by the trust			1
mrs @entity41 , a business manager for an insurance company , said : ‘ we 've always had two dogs together , i like them to have company and so taking on two of them was n't a daunting prospect			0
' my daughter moved out five months ago , taking her two @entity58 setters with her , so the house has felt a little quiet without them			0
@entity62 : @entity1 's lack of sight has heightened her other senses so she can often tell if @entity4 is nearby without the pair touching ‘ we live in the countryside and i miss having a reason to go for a walk - i ca n't wait to take the dogs out with us			1
we 've also got a lovely big garden so it 's the perfect setting for two huge dogs			0
’ the couple plan to take the great danes on holidays to @entity76 and the @entity77 and ensure they both enjoy life with their new family			1
@entity81 , manager of the @entity13 in @entity14 , said : ‘ this is the happy ending we were all hoping for and everyone is delighted for @entity1 and @entity4			2
‘ the @entity16 family were the perfect match and we know they 'll give the dogs all the love and fuss they so deserve			0

couple *decided* to take in @entity1 and @entity4 after reading about them in the @entity7
dogs can now look forward to holidays in @entity76 and the @entity77
