@entity0 is among actresses whose naked photographs were posted on the website last week according to denizens of the darker corners of the internet , where criminality and vice thrive on private forums , the pictures had been around for months			1
a small group of hackers , linked by their obsessive interest in finding explicit images of female celebrities , would email each other stolen photos and videos they had obtained			1
they would compete for ‘ wins ’ and see who could get the biggest ‘ score ’ — depending on the degree of a victim ’s fame			2
to these internet perverts , women were just objects and trophies			0
it is n’t clear what these men ultimately intended to do with their haul of celebrity porn — amounting possibly to thousands of images of more than 100 actresses , performers and even @entity37 athletes			1
but making money was clearly a possibility and so was blackmail			0
so far , though , these cyber-thieves have not got much more than a couple of hundred dollars for their sordid activities , and now have the @entity44 on their tail into the bargain , after one of their number broke rank and started leaking them on to a controversial picture - sharing website last sunday			1
over the past week , it has emerged that at least 400 pictures have been posted online			1
as for the women stars , they were naturally shocked and humiliated as their @entity55 rushed to condemn the publication of the most intimate contents of their clients ’ digital photo albums			0
the photos and videos were , it is believed , stolen from @entity65 — the global system that stores photos and videos recorded on iphones and other @entity71 devices			1
the victims include the @entity76 - winning young actress @entity0 , @entity78 star @entity77 , @entity80 heroine @entity79 , busty supermodel @entity81 and reality tv phenomenon @entity73			1
a list of celebrity names published anonymously online mentions scores more targets including actresses @entity86 and @entity88 , singer @entity89 , @entity92 models @entity90 and @entity93 , and tv presenter @entity94			1
some are shown naked , others topless and a few are sexually ‘ in flagrante delicto ’			0
one video — reportedly showing @entity77 , who played @entity100 ’s @entity99 , engaged in somewhat unladylike behaviour — was watched more than a million times online within hours of being posted			0
celebrities who are used to controlling their public image with a vice-like grip have had to watch helplessly as millions around the world have been able to access their most private moments			0
so - called @entity107 began last weekend when someone calling himself ‘ @entity109 ’ posted explicit pictures of @entity0 and other stars on a notoriously sordid but influential internet ‘ image board ’ called 4chan that attracts 12 million visitors a month			1
the site is used principally by young men , and its guarantee of anonymity ( users do n’t have to register before posting messages ) has seen it described as ‘ the ninth circle of @entity123 ’			1
and yet it was set up by a sweet - faced 15 - year - old schoolboy , @entity125 , in his @entity127 bedroom in 2003			1
he wanted to offer a forum for people to put whatever they wanted online with no rules and no fear of prosecution			0
his business backers in a newer internet venture include some of the founding investors of @entity137 and the news site @entity139			1
in 2009 , @entity125 was voted the world ’s most influential person by @entity142 although 4chan users reportedly rigged the poll			1
his vision of a completely free , unrestricted exchange of information is , after all , what the @entity92 computer scientist sir @entity148 envisaged when he invented the @entity150			0
the original aim for 4chan — as a slightly risque forum for teenagers — soon turned into an internet cesspool as users exploited it to spread the most vile material			1
in so - called ‘ shock posts ’ , they try to outdo each other in offensiveness			1
for example , pictures of dead people and car accidents are popular , as is extreme pornography and virulent racism			0
despite being the only type of material that is meant to be banned from the site , child porn is regularly posted			1
‘ pranks ’ have included taunting the family of a suicide victim , starting bomb and school shooting scares , encouraging young fans of the singer @entity180 to harm themselves and triggering a false rumour that @entity71 founder @entity182 had died of a heart attack			0
anyone who offends the 4chan community or other cheerleaders for the out - of - control internet can expect revenge attacks			2
@entity197 the credit card companies @entity192 and @entity193 stopped handling donations to the whistle - blowing site @entity196 , they were targeted by on - line vigilantes who managed to crash their websites			1
indeed , many members of the sinister mask - wearing international vigilante hacking group @entity201 started out as 4chan members			2
most of 4chan ’s most offensive content is posted on its digital message board , called / b / , where members call themselves ‘ / b / tards ’ and live up to the title with displays of vicious misogyny			0
countless pages are devoted to ‘ revenge porn ’ — once the unpleasant practice of posting publicly compromising photos of an ex-lover , this is now a catch - all term for any compromising photos of women published online without their consent			1
an even more revolting trend is for so - called ‘ creepshots ’ , in which men try to photograph the bodies of women or girls — often under - age — whom they have seen out in public			2
once again , marks are awarded for the most compromising shots			0
if challenged over why they are allowing pictures that have been taken up a teenager ’s skirt , websites like 4chan say it was legal as it occurred in a public place			0
revealing photographs of model @entity81 ( left ) and reality star @entity73 ( right ) are also believed to have been obtained by hackers most sickeningly , some 4chan users felt the site was n’t sufficiently pornographic and formed a break - away message board , @entity246 , where hackers calling themselves ‘ @entity248 ’ advertise their services to break into the online account of any woman and download her private photos			1
the site ’s so - called ‘ obtained pictures ’ section lists the email and @entity65 addresses of dozens of women			1
when a hacker successfully breaks into their account , they notch up ‘ win ’ and post any embarrassing pictures they find			0
experts believe this latest celebrity stalking began in what is known as the @entity267 ( or @entity268 or @entity269 ) a noxious matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity			2
it has existed for more than a decade and has been used by criminals to deal in drugs , sell weapons and view horrific child pornography			0
much of the trade is done with bitcoins , the controversial digital currency which is increasingly used by cyber-criminals to cloak their activities			0
users of 4chan ’s / b / messageboard reacted with predictable glee when the leaker of the naked celebrity snaps chose their forum to announce their existence			2
@entity109 , as he calls himself , sought donations in bitcoins from anyone accessing the images			0
the photos , he said , had been ‘ privately traded ’ in this currency after being stolen from celebrities ’ accounts on @entity65			1
subsequently , more pictures appeared on mainstream picture - sharing websites where they were labelled ‘ @entity304 ’			2
( ‘ @entity307 ’ is slang for masturbation			0
) @entity308 has said his group also has an explicit video of @entity0 that they are willing to sell			0
@entity311 and several other victims have admitted the photos are genuine and have threatened to prosecute anyone identified as having posted pictures of them			2
but internet experts warn that it may be impossible to remove the images from the web permanently			0
six days on from the original leak , the identity of the hacker — or it is widely assumed , hackers — remains unclear			0
in theory , every hacker leaves a ‘ digital trail ’ and it has been reported that some of them may be as far afield as @entity329 and the @entity331 @entity330			1
after @entity71 insisted there had been no widespread breach of its @entity65 — if true , a huge relief for the millions of ordinary people who store their photos and other private files on it — it has been suggested that the thieves simply used various trial - and - error techniques to find out specific celebrity email addresses and passwords			1
meanwhile , the release of more embarrassing photos and videos is expected			2
also , it has emerged that some of the already published photos — of 18 - year - old @entity331 gymnast @entity350 and an @entity352 actress named @entity353 — were taken while they were under - age			1
cynical users of the website 4chan went on @entity356 to encourage girls to post pictures of themselves naked — supposedly to show ‘ solidarity ’ with @entity0			2
@entity363 , a hugely popular but sleaze - filled internet forum largely owned by @entity365 , publishers of @entity361 and @entity362 , has been enthusiastically spreading the offending pictures			2
sensing a backlash that might damage the parent company ’s reputation , its editors urged members to donate to the @entity372 ‘ in honour of @entity0 ’			0
but the charity — as soon as it discovered the donations — returned the money , stating publicly that it was considered tainted			0
predictably , such an ethical stance did not impress @entity363 users , who complained about the charity ’s reaction			2
severely bruised by the whole experience , celebrities such as @entity0 and @entity77 will undoubtedly think twice about posing for casual snaps in future			0
but by unwittingly exposing the rotten , dark heart of the internet , they have done us all a valuable service .			0

@entity390 attracts *12million* anonymous users a month
