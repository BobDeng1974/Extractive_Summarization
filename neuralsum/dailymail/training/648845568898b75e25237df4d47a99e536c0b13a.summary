it is a further embarrassment for the prestigious command at a time when security is already under review at high - profile buildings in the wake of the @entity125 shooting			0
last week the @entity9 announced it was shaking up the structure of its protection wing after a litany of scandals including @entity130			0

known as @entity169 , the @entity42 unit is one of the most elite in the force			1
