@entity10 foreign secretary @entity0 ( left ) has warned that the @entity22 crisis is ' a burning building with no exits ' while @entity17 president @entity16 ( right ) described it as a ' baptism of fire ' amid growing speculation that @entity27 might be forced to abandon the single currency , he insisted that ‘ @entity29 is and will remain a member of the eurozone ’			1
but a split has opened up among eurozone countries over the details of @entity29 ’s second € 109billion ( £ 95billion ) bailout , with up to seven members calling for private creditors to do more			2
in a sign of growing splits within the @entity41 , deputy prime minister @entity38 will today deliver a fiercely pro-european speech calling for greater unity and co-operation between countries on issues such as defence			2

crisis : mr @entity16 , pictured with @entity8 foreign affairs representative @entity62 , said the eurozone should push forwards with integration to avert the debt crisis ‘ i described the euro as a burning building with no exits and so it has proved for some of the countries in it			1
but there are no exits			0
’ mr @entity0 adds : ‘ there should be powers returned to this country			1
we should be clear in the @entity78 that that is where we are heading			0

in a speech at the @entity93 in @entity94 yesterday , mr @entity16 said : ‘ today we are facing the biggest challenges this union has ever had to face – a financial crisis , an economic and social crisis , but also a crisis of confidence			1
‘ if we do not move forward with more unification , we ’ll suffer more fragmentation			0
i think this is going to be a baptism of fire for a whole generation			1
’ mr @entity16 added that monetary union should be completed by economic union , and he sent shivers down the spines of eurosceptic @entity111 by hinting that more @entity113 changes were needed			0
‘ it was an illusion to think we could have a common currency and a single market with national approaches to economic and budgetary policy , ’ he added			0
