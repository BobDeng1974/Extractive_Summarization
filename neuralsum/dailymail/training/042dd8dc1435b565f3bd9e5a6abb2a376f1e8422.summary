by @entity0 , business correspondent four thousand people are getting a job every day – the largest increase since records began , official figures revealed yesterday			1
the data saw the pound hit an 18 - month high against the euro as investors speculated that the @entity10 will be forced to raise interest rates before the end of the year			0
it was thought the @entity10 would not act until after the @entity14 in may , but increasing numbers of analysts now believe the first hike since 2007 could come possibly as early as november			0
the number of people in work has reached a new record high of 30.5million , after a rise which was the highest since records began in 1971			1
four thousand people are now getting a job every day , according to the figures flipside : but figures also show a dramatic slowdown in pay growth , prolonging the squeeze on family finances between february and april , the @entity32 said a record - breaking 345,000 people started work , raising @entity36 ’s total workforce to a new high of 30.5million			1
since the @entity39 came to power in may 2010 , more than two million private sector jobs have been created			1
meanwhile , the public sector workforce has shrunk by nearly 400,000			2
this excludes the distorting impact of ‘ reclassifications ’ , such as staff at @entity46 , which was rescued by the @entity47 , being switched from the public to the private sector			1
last night @entity50 , of @entity51 , described the rise in employment as ‘ colossal ’			2
@entity54 said it meant more people had ‘ the security of a pay packet and a brighter future ’			0
@entity60 , the employment minister , said : ‘ businesses up and down the country are feeling increasingly confident about creating jobs			1
’ three years ago , shadow chancellor @entity64 said it was ‘ a complete fantasy ’ that the private sector could replace jobs lost in the public sector			1
of those aged between 16 and 64 , the @entity32 said 72.9 per cent are working , which is within touching distance of the all - time high of 73.1 per cent			0
@entity72 , of the @entity73 , said : ‘ this is an unprecedented rise in the number of people in work			2
unemployment continues to fall , down 347,000 over the last year to 2.17million people , the largest annual drop in the number of people looking for work for six years			2
’ the unemployment rate is now 6.6 per cent			0
employment minister @entity60 said young @entity85 were the best in the world and urged critics to stop talking down their prospects the figures come a day after manufacturing growth jumped to a new three - year high in april after a 4.4 per cent surge in output on the same period in 2013			1
the performance was the strongest year - on - year showing since february 2011 , adding to hopes that overall gdp accelerated in the second quarter			0
the @entity32 figures showed an improvement in output of 0.4 per cent compared with a month earlier			0
yesterday ’s statistics revealed that although the country ’s workforce is bigger than ever , the pay squeeze remains in place			0
@entity107 , of the @entity109 website , said : ‘ @entity36 ’s jobs market is booming everywhere apart from in most people ’s pay packets			1
’ the average pay rise is just 0.7 per cent , far below inflation of 1.8 per cent , which means people ’s bills are rising much faster than their pay is going up			2
it is a squeeze which has lasted for six years , meaning many workers complain their family finances are close to breaking point or that their lifestyle has changed for the worse			2
@entity124 , of the @entity125 , said : ‘ the stark contrast between a robust jobs market , but meagre wages growth continues			0
for the recovery to truly hit home , pay packets need to start growing again			0
’ the @entity32 said the figure was distorted by a big jump in pay rises in april last year as a result of the tax change , which cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p on earnings over £ 150,000			0
as a result , the annual bonus bonanza enjoyed by bankers and other workers was delayed			0
the figures also cast doubt on claims that only part - time jobs have been created since the financial crisis began as @entity36 stages its economic recovery			1
between february and april , full - time jobs were created more than three times faster than part - time jobs .			1

345,000 more jobs in 3 months , biggest rise since records began in 1971
*2million* private sector jobs created since the *coalition* was formed in 2010
employment minister *admits* ' times have been tough ' during the *recession*
*insists* *post-studying* job prospects are better in @entity36 than @entity166 or @entity167
economy has taken six years to recover from impact of financial crash
