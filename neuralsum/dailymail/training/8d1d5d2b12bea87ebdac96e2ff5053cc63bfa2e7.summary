@entity0 today insisted he will not pay ' anything like ' the £ 1.7billion being demanded by the @entity2 - after @entity4 chiefs warned the @entity6 rebate could be up for grabs if he does not pay up			1
budget commissioner @entity8 said it would be ' extremely difficult ' for the prime minister to challenge the @entity2 's demand for extra cash – despite mr @entity0 's angry insistence that he will not pay it by the due date of december 1			1
mr @entity8 said the move risked opening a ' @entity16 ' which could put the future of the @entity6 's £ 3billion - a - year rebate in question			1
but in a statement to the @entity21 this afternoon mr @entity0 said : ‘ @entity6 will not be paying two billion euros to anyone on december 1 and we reject this scale of payment			1
' and in a clear indication that he believes the row has undermined public support for @entity2 membership , mr @entity0 told mps : ‘ for those of us who want to argue that the @entity2 is capable of reform , this was not a good development			2
we want to check on the way the statistics were arrived at , the methodology that was used			0
we will crawl through this in exhaustive detail			0
’ and he told @entity30 : ‘ we are not paying two billion on december 1 and we are not paying a sum anything like that			0
‘ when your economy grows , you pay a bit more			0
when your economy shrinks , you pay a bit less			0
but what is not acceptable is a two billion euro bill and we wo n't be paying it			0
’ but the prime minister was accused of being ‘ asleep at the wheel ’ by @entity59 leader @entity58 , who said mr @entity0 should have been aware for at least two years that changes to @entity6 's contribution to the @entity2 budget were in the offing			1
@entity65 mp @entity65 tweeted : ‘ @entity66 : @entity57 sounding tough but so far not actually ruling out paying £ 1.7 billion			2
’ any change would require amendments to @entity2 law supported by a majority of @entity73 countries			0
@entity73 commissioner mr @entity8 warned that the @entity6 was obliged by law to pay by this deadline and would be liable for ' late payment fines ' if it failed to hand over the cash			1
mr @entity8 said he was ' surprised ' by the pm 's reaction , insisting that the adjustment of @entity6 's contribution to the @entity2 budget - known in @entity4 jargon as ' own resources ' - was a routine annual procedure about which @entity84 was well aware			1
the figures behind the calculation were provided by the @entity6 's @entity87 and the @entity6 was informed on october 17 of the scale of the surcharge being demanded , he said			2
the commissioner warned that opening up discussions over the @entity2 's budget threatened the @entity6 rebate			1
@entity73 budget commissioner @entity8 said it would be extremely difficult to change @entity2 law to give @entity6 more time to pay the bill the chart shows the monstrous bill handed to the @entity6 by the @entity2 in comparison with other member states @entity0 was left red - faced last week after he was forced to admit he had been kept in the dark for days about the shock £ 1.7billion demand after @entity104 failed to inform him			1
the surprise bill was presented to the @entity106 by the @entity107 on friday october 17			0
but extraordinarily it was almost a week before the prime minister learnt about it on thursday			0
and according to @entity59 , the @entity87 might have known about it five months ago			0
but asked what prospect there was for a renegotiation of the cash demand , mr @entity8 told a @entity4 press conference : ' never in the past was there a situation where such a decision was changed and the implementation regulations changed because one of the member states have contested it			2
' i am afraid that it will be extremely difficult to do it , especially because the own resources decision and implementation regulations concern as well the @entity6 's rebate , so if you open this for future negotiations , you open a @entity16			1
' but mr @entity0 's official spokesman responded : ‘ the rebate remains entirely justified			2
it is not on the table			0
’ mr @entity8 said that the same calculation of @entity6 's gross national income ( @entity139 ) produced by the @entity87 would result in a £ 500 million increase in the rebate next year , and added : ' i think it would be extremely difficult to explain to other member states why on monday you like this data , and on tuesday you do n't like it			1
' responding to mr @entity0 's claim that the demand was sprung on @entity6 with little notice , mr @entity8 said : ' i was surprised by the reaction because ... up to this moment there was no single signal from the @entity6 administration that they had problems with this figure			1
' speaking to a @entity157 press briefing , mr @entity0 's official spokesman made clear that there was no question of the @entity57 putting @entity6 's rebate - negotiated by @entity160 in 1984 - on the table			1
asked if it was correct that the rebate would not be on the table when chancellor @entity104 meets fellow finance ministers , the spokesman said : ' yes			0
' labour leader @entity58 accused the prime minister of being ' asleep at the wheel ' over the @entity2 budget demand mr @entity104 is later this week expected to discuss the surcharge demand with @entity2 finance ministers , including @entity173 's @entity172 , in the margins of an @entity176 summit in @entity177 on wednesday			1
speaking during a visit to @entity179 , mr @entity0 said : ' we face tough battles in @entity73 because that 's the nature of what you have to do			0
' he added : ' i think @entity6 is best off in a reformed @entity2 - but you have to fight for those reforms			2
that means a fair deal over funding , a fair deal over migration , [ it ] means access to @entity73 markets , but these things are n't achieved without a fight			0
' the @entity197 media today reacted mockingly to mr @entity0 ’s refusal to pay @entity6 ’s @entity2 budget contribution – likening him to an angry diner out of @entity201			1
all major outlets highlighted the prime minister ’s fury , with the @entity205 running the headline : ‘ @entity207 refuses to take out his cheque book for @entity73 ’			0
@entity73 1 radio station was typical of those which took up the @entity201 theme , portraying mr @entity0 as the kind of ranting and very dissatisfied restaurant customer who used to visit @entity216 ’s hotel in the 1970s comedy sitcom starring @entity218			0
@entity73 1 writes on its website : ‘ a diner unconvinced by the proposed @entity2 menu , @entity0 refuses to pay the bill			2
‘ it has to be said this is a bit rich , because @entity4 is demanding an additional two billion euros from @entity6 as part of its share of @entity2 budget			1
‘ faced with this request , the @entity6 prime minister has abandoned the traditional @entity231 reserve to rant at a press conference that was held on friday			0
’ @entity233 runs a picture showing mr @entity0 with his mouth wide open , and suggests that he was forced to act in such an angry manner by the success of the @entity6 @entity238			2
‘ under immense pressure from @entity241 , notably since the last @entity73 elections which saw @entity65 win more than 27 per cent of the vote , @entity0 believes that this demand does not support the issue of @entity6 being in the @entity2 , ’ the @entity239 daily wrote			1
like many other papers , @entity246 and @entity247 concentrate on the reaction of @entity250 to the growing crisis , quoting the clearly irritated @entity253 president as saying : ‘ respecting treaties is for everybody			0

@entity0 said he would not pay the @entity2 's demand for extra £ 1.7billion
budget commissioner @entity8 says he is ' surprised ' by @entity57 's reaction
he said it risked opening a ' @entity16 ' which threatened the @entity6 rebate
the rebate is worth some £ 3 billion a year to @entity6 *taxpayers*
