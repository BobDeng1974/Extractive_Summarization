@entity1 cyber spies have been caught trying to steal the secrets of @entity4 ’s most sophisticated combat jet , @entity5 has learned			1
a covert unit within the @entity7 has been using highly sophisticated cyber weapons in a desperate attempt to acquire classified information about the stealthy @entity11 ( @entity11 )			0
manufacturer @entity12 claims it is thwarting tens of thousands of computer attacks every week to keep secure secrets about the jet – due to be in service with the @entity18 and @entity19 by 2018			1
cutting edge : an f - 35 fighter taking shape			0
each of the jets costs £ 100million invisible : the @entity11 can fool radar systems due to its shape which makes it hard to detect hackers : @entity12 is receiving tens of thousands of cyber attacks from @entity1 every week ( file photo ) the defence giant has recruited some of @entity4 ’s brightest ‘ young geeks ’ to help thwart the attacks , based in a secure area of the company ’s counter-cyber headquarters in @entity39 , @entity40			1
a source said : ‘ we have recruited a very strong team of young computer engineers who are basically experts in counter-cyber			2
they are effectively all geeks and spend much of their time war - gaming against the @entity1			1
‘ they allow the foreign hackers through the first few security levels and then can work out , through a process of reverse engineering , where the attacks are originating			2
‘ it ’s the same country every time – @entity1			2
the @entity1 try to disguise what they are doing but their guys are not as good as ours			2
’ the @entity11 can fly into enemy territory and attack targets with precision - guided weapons without being detected – a capability which is said to terrify @entity1 generals			2
the aircraft is coated with a special paint and has a stealthy design which means it is almost completely invisible to radar			2
the @entity1 government is understood to have developed a sophisticated ‘ exfiltration cyber weapon ’ which can steal information by secretly downloading computer files			1
@entity71 , @entity4 ’s security service , and @entity74 ’s @entity73 both believe the cyber attacks against @entity12 originate from a secret cell within the @entity1 ’s @entity7			1
big business : @entity12 is the world 's largest defence contracting company the unit is understood to be staffed by hundreds of @entity83 - speaking computer experts whose sole job is to steal information from the @entity74 and @entity4			1
but despite the weight of evidence supporting the claims , the @entity1 government denies any knowledge of the unit ’s existence and refutes all allegations that it is involved in cyber espionage			1
the latest allegations of @entity1 cyber theft follow a report last week from the @entity74 defence department , which accused the @entity1 of launching attacks on @entity101 computers			1
in the report , officials said : ‘ in 2012 numerous computer systems around the world , including those owned by the @entity74 government , continued to be targeted for intrusions , some of which appear to be attributable directly to the @entity1 government and military			1
’ the @entity11 can reach 1,300mph and has a range of 1,450 miles , making it faster and more capable than any @entity1 fighter			1
the jet ’s invisibility – called ‘ @entity116 ’ or @entity118 stealth – is achieved through its shape which is designed to dramatically reduce detection by enemy aircraft and defence systems			0
' @entity123 sponsored ' : both @entity71 and the @entity73 suspect the @entity124 may be behind the attacks , something it denies the jsf ’s hull is made from advanced materials whose formula is classified , and it is coated with a special paint which also reduces its radar reflection			0
the aircraft ’s advanced electronic warfare capabilities mean it can locate and track enemy forces , jam radio frequencies and disrupt attacks – allowing it to reach highly - defended targets while suppressing enemy radar detection			0
each pilot is fitted with a special helmet and visor which shows all of the aircraft ’s data and provides a 360 - degree view of the battle space			0
inside the cockpit , there is speech recognition so that a pilot can talk to the @entity11 – and the aircraft talks @entity155 jet also has a glass screen digital instrument panel that the pilot can touch to pull up data – similar to that used on smartphones			0
both the @entity18 and the @entity19 will be equipped with the £ 100 million @entity162 version of the @entity11 , known as the jump jet or short take - off / vertical landing ( @entity166 ) model , which can hover or land by itself at the press of a button			0
such advanced features and instrumentation explain why @entity12 want to safeguard the jet ’s secrets			0
@entity4 base : @entity12 's counter-cyber headquarters are in @entity39 , @entity40 most of the @entity4 geeks fighting the attacks are graduates of @entity180 ’s forensic computing masters degree			1
dr @entity181 , senior lecturer in cyber security at @entity180 , said his students were particularly attractive to the defence industry because of their skills in ‘ ethical hacking ’ and ‘ penetration prevention ’ techniques			0
dr @entity181 said : ‘ we know that sophisticated “ exfiltration cyber weapons ” are being used against companies like @entity12			1
‘ these types of cyber weapons are used by countries or organisations attempting to steal secret information			0
these attacks are extremely sophisticated and are nearly always state - sponsored			0
’ a spokesman for @entity12 said : ‘ we recognise the significance of the f - 35 programme and the fact that it – along with many of our other programmes – faces constant threats from adversaries around the world			0
‘ we regularly take actions to increase the security of our systems and to protect our employee , customer and programme data			0

@entity12 said it was being targeted by hackers from @entity1
company is building new joint strike fighter which is ' invisible ' on radar
