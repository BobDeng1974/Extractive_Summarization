by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has revealed a stunning animation that put viewers right in the heart of a massive solar storm			1
it reveals an explosion of solar particles , seen as white static , as they were ejected from the solar surface			2
the 2005 solar storm was incredibly powerful - but baffled researchers by barely affecting power on earth			1
closer to @entity25 , it created a solar storm with an unusual combination of strong and weak effects			1
solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			1
astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission			0
they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity25 ’s magnetic field			0
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			1
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0
using new data and the animation , they were able to piece together what happened			1
the space weather storm from the sun engulfed our planet on jan. 21 , 2005			1
the event got its start on jan. 20 , when a cloud of solar material , a coronal mass ejection or @entity66 , burst off the sun and headed toward @entity25			2
when it arrived at our planet , the ring current and radiation belts surrounding @entity25 swelled with extra particles , while the aurora persisted for six hours			0
both of these are usually signs of a very large storm – indeed , this was one of the largest outpouring of solar protons ever monitored from the sun. but the storm barely affected the magnetic fields around @entity25 – disturbances in these fields can affect power grids on the ground , a potential space weather effect keenly watched for by a society so dependent on electricity			1
@entity89 , a space scientist at the @entity91 in @entity92 , thought this intriguing combination of a simultaneously weak and strong solar storm deserved further scrutiny			1
in an effort to better understand -- and some day forecast -- such storms and their potential effects on human technology , an unusual event like this can help researchers understand just what aspects of a @entity66 lead to what effects near @entity25			2
' there were features appearing that we generally only see during extreme space weather events , when by other measures the storm was moderate , ' said @entity89			2
a filament of cold dense solar material moved toward the front of a jan. 20 , 2005 , coronal mass ejection , which led to an unusually large amount of solar material funneling into near - @entity25 space during a jan. 21 solar storm			1
' we wanted to look at it holistically , much like terrestrial weather researchers do with extreme weather			2
' we took every single piece of data that we could find on the solar storm and put it together to see what was going on			1
' with observations collected from ground - based networks and 20 different satellites , @entity131 and a group of colleagues , each an expert in different aspects of the data or models , found that the @entity66 contained a rare piece of dense solar filament material			1
this filament coupled with an unusually fast speed led to the large amount of solar material observed			0
a fortuitous magnetic geometry , however , softened the blow , leading to reduced magnetic effects			0
these results were published in the aug. 14 , 2014 , issue of @entity149 , @entity150			0
the researchers gathered data from spacecraft orbiting in @entity25 's ionosphere , which extends up to 600 miles above the planet 's surface , and satellites above that , orbiting through the heart of @entity25 's magnetic environment , the magnetosphere			1
twelve spacecraft in @entity25 ’s magnetosphere – in addition to other missions -- helped scientists better observe and understand an unusual january 2005 solar storm			1
the four @entity169 spacecraft were in the solar wind , directly upstream of @entity25			2
the massive amount of data was then incorporated into a variety of models developed at the @entity91 's @entity175 , which are housed at the @entity177 at @entity2 's @entity178 in @entity179 , @entity180 , a facility dedicated to providing comprehensive access to space weather models			1
with the models in hand , the team could put together the story of this particular solar storm			2
it began with the @entity66 on jan. 20 , 2005			0
the @entity23 and @entity2 's @entity22 , or @entity22 , captured images of the @entity66			1
in this case , however , it seems that the dense filament sped forward , past the leading edge of the @entity66 , so as it slammed into the magnetosphere , it delivered an extra big dose of energetic particles into near - @entity25 space			0
' within one hour of the impact , a cold , dense plasma sheet formed out of the filament material , ' said @entity89			0
' high density material continued to move through the magnetosphere for the entire six hours of the filament 's passage			0
' despite the intense amount of plasma carried by the @entity66 , it still lacked a key component of a super storm			0
the magnetic fields embedded in this @entity66 generally pointed toward @entity25 's north pole , just as @entity25 's own magnetic fields do			0
this configuration causes far fewer disruptions to our planet 's system than when the @entity66 's fields point southward			0
when pointing south , the @entity66 's fields clash with @entity25 's , peeling them back and setting off magnetic perturbations that cascade through the magnetosphere			0
the magnetic field orientation is what kept this solar storm to low levels			2
on the other hand , the extra solar material from the filament catalyzed long - term aurora over the poles and enhanced the particle filled radiation belts around @entity25 , characteristic of a larger storm			1
' this event , with its unusual combination of space weather effects really demonstrates why it 's important to look at the entire system , not just individual elements , ' said @entity89			0
' only by using all of this data , by watching the event from the beginning to the end , can we begin to understand all the different facets of an extreme storm like this			2
