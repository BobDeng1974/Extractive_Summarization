beautician @entity0 has made a dress that is good enough to eat - adorned with 700,000 multi-coloured sugar strands			1
@entity0 , 26 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , spent 30 hours gluing the sweets - normally used to decorate trifles and cakes - to the fabric of the two - piece outfit at the rate of 250 per square inch			1
and she worked her way through 18lbs of the micro-sweets at a cost of £ 96			0
and the tubes of glue cost her another £ 60			0
@entity0 , 26 , spent 30 hours gluing the two - piece dress with £ 96 worth of sugar strands			1
she even spent three hours sorting out the pink sweets so she could decorate the skirt with a pink heart @entity0 , a mother - of - two , said : ' i think the dress looks fantastic - although the sweets made a terrible mess in the house while i was making it			1
they ended up all over the place			0
' she first sewed a crop top and constructed a long hooped skirt stiffened with wire			0
then she squirted glue on the fabric and delicately placed the sugar strands with a make - up brush			1
she even spent three hours sorting out all the pink ones - a couple of millimetres long - so she could decorate the skirt with a pink heart			1
@entity0 , from @entity3 , @entity4 said : ' i stuck loads of the sugar strands on but i would lose a lot whenever i moved it			1
' loads of the them ended up all over the floor and i was always having to vacuum them up			0
they were all over the house			0
@entity0 would squirt glue onto the fabric and then dab sugar strands on with a make - up brush ' i am now lacquering the dress to make them completely secure			1
' she is now planning to auction the dress off for charity - one she made last year out of 14,000 @entity61 sweets ended up being shipped to @entity62 where it was to be displayed at @entity64			1
but it was damaged in transit			0
@entity0 came up with the sweet idea for the first dress as a way of raising money for a cancer charity			1
she said : ' after making one dress out of sweets i got hooked and decided to make another			2
people think i am mad but i think they look great			0
@entity75 first sewed a crop top and then constructed a wire hoop for the skirting			2
she plans on auctioning off the dress to raise money for a cancer charity ' this one has been messier than the first to make			1
i thought using sugar strands would be easier - but it was harder and more intricate			2
she said her partner @entity87 , 31 would come home from his night shift as a store assistant and finding evidence of the sweets crunched into the carpet			2
she added : ' he thinks i am crazy and he 's getting fed up with the mess and smell of the sweets			2
i must admit it is pretty sickly			0
not only that , when you tread on them you ended up with multi-coloured powder all over the place			0
' but i think the dress is well worth the trouble			2
the dress looks great although admittedly you ca n't go out in the rain as the colours would run			2
@entity75 created a dress last year out of 14,000 @entity61 sweets which was shipped to @entity62 and displayed at @entity110 ' @entity111 is all right			1
. as long as you are not anywhere really hot like @entity114			0
' she also had to watch daughter @entity116 18 months and son @entity117 , 11 did n't try eating the dress			0
she said : ' when i made the @entity61 dress i kept finding patches where some of the sweets had vanished			1
' i eventually realised that it was @entity117 who was secretly snacking when my back was turned			0
this time he has been on his best behaviour			0
