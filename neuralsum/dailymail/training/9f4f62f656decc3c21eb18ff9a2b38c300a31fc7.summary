the secret to staying slim could be in saliva			2
researchers have found that a gene that makes a carb - busting compound has a large influence on weight			1
nicknamed the @entity9 in some quarters after the popular diet , its official scientific nickname is @entity12			1
the gene makes an enzyme that is found in saliva and begins the breakdown and digestion of starchy foods like chips , crisps and rice			1
carbohydrates : researchers have found that a gene that makes an enzyme found in saliva begins the breakdown of starchy food and can have a large influence on weight the study showed that people who had more copies of the gene made more of the enzyme and were more likely to be slim			1
although we normally think of genes as coming in pairs , some people will only have one copy of a gene			0
others will have two , three or even more			0
in the case of the @entity12 gene , it possible to have up to 20 copies			1
those who had fewer copies would be likely to find carbohydrates more difficult to digest - and therefore more likely to put on weight the journal @entity50 reports			2
nickname : the @entity12 gene has been nicknamed the @entity9 after the popular diet devised by dr @entity53 ( pictured ) it is not clear why			1
but one possibility is that the undigested starch is feasted on by gut bacteria that fuel obesity by tinkering with the metabolism			0
the researchers , from @entity61 and @entity62 , said that future dietary advice may have to be tailored to a person ’s digestive system			0
professor @entity66 , the study ’s joint lead author , said : ‘ these findings are very exciting			0
‘ the next step is to find out more about the activity of this digestive enzyme and whether this might prove a useful marker or target for the treatment of obesity			0
‘ in the future , a simple blood or saliva test might be used to measure levels of key enzymes such as amylase in the body and therefore shape dietary advice for both overweight and underweight people			0
‘ treatments are a long way away but this is an important step in realising that all of us digest and metabolise food differently – and we can move away from ‘ one - size fits all diets ’ to more personalised approaches			2
