as a schoolgirl , @entity0 had twin passions — politics and horses			1
had she chosen to pursue the former , spring 2015 , with an election looming , could well have proved an important time in her life			2
but the woman who now runs a 70 - box stable in @entity9 is hoping that , having favoured horses over @entity11 , the same period definitely turns out to be momentous when she saddles @entity12 , her first runner in the £ 1 million @entity15 's @entity14 on april 11			1
if the 10 - year - old wins , @entity16 would be the third female trainer to win jump racing 's best known race this century following @entity21 , with @entity22 in 2009 and @entity23 , with @entity24 in 2013			1
@entity0 poses with @entity12 , her first runner in the £ 1 million @entity15 's @entity14 and she would also be feted , along with her former jockey husband and assistant @entity27 , for executing a long - term precision plan			1
@entity29 has not run since november as @entity16 patiently kept him fresh for the drier spring ground on which he excels			1
@entity16 said : ' i did a lot of public speaking and debating at school			1
love her or hate her , she was a big presence			0
as a schoolgirl , @entity16 had twin passions — politics and horses - now she is targeting the @entity14 ' she got me interested in politics			1
i am opinionated and i like talking			0
i am not so sure now because it is all so grey but at the time i would have been happy to go down that road			0
' @entity16 's communication skills with owners and staff have been essential after a devastating setback at the start of the season when she lost two of her best horses			1
@entity54 , who had finished sixth in the @entity55 at the 2014 @entity56 , was killed in his first steeplechase , at @entity58 in october , and @entity59 , thought capable of contesting top - quality steeplechases , suffered a serious tendon injury at @entity62 a week later			2
@entity12 has not run since november as @entity16 patiently kept him fresh for the drier spring ground @entity16 said : ' it really hit us hard			1
it was like a football team losing their best two players at the start of the season			0
' it was hard to pick up and get going again			0
but you have to keep positive , keep going forward and take your team with you			0
' @entity16 's season has been rebuilt around @entity76 winner @entity74 , much - improved @entity77 , exciting @entity79 winner see @entity80 and , of course , @entity12 , who is owned by @entity84 chairman @entity83			1
@entity16 's decision to enter racing rather than politics was heavily influenced by the late @entity88 @entity12 ridden by @entity89 clears the last to win the @entity90 the @entity14 entry , who will be ridden at @entity58 by @entity93 , won at @entity94 in october and was then awarded the @entity95 at @entity96 after finishing second to fast - improving unqualified entry , @entity97			1
subsequent events tell us @entity12 faced handicapping @entity100 that day			0
for saturday week , trainer and horse have that essential @entity58 ingredient — a good story to tell			2
@entity16 's decision to enter racing rather than politics was heavily influenced by working for the late @entity88 , who won the @entity58 race twice			1
@entity16 , who was first invited to spend a week with @entity88 aged 11 when he trained a horse for her father , said : ' i was so lucky he let me be so involved			2
i was n't strong enough to carry the water bucket in the morning			0
i filled it and had to get someone to carry it back to the stable			0
when i look back i found it staggering that , even having ridden ponies , he let me ride racehorses			0
the @entity14 entry , who will be ridden at @entity58 by @entity93 , won at @entity94 in october ' he was someone you could learn as much as you wanted to off			2
if you asked the questions , he would give you the answers			0
he was a big man who enveloped you in everything			0
' @entity12 , an overpriced 50 - 1 shot allotted 10st 3lb , has overcome two serious problems — a leg injury when falling on his point - to - point debut and an infected leg which kept him off the course for almost two years and could have ended his career			2
@entity16 added : ' having missed the best part of two years , he has not had much racing but maybe it is a blessing in disguise ; he is so much stronger			2
now , he 's the best he 's ever been			0

as a schoolgirl , @entity0 had twin passions - politics and horses
now @entity16 is targeting the @entity14 with @entity29 by *surprise*
she hopes to become the third female trainer to win the race this century
the two others were @entity21 in 2009 and @entity23 in 2013
