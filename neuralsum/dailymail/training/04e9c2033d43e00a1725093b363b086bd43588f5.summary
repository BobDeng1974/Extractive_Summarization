by @entity0 commuters heading to work in @entity2 this morning were baffled by the sight of a woman ' walking ' a man on all fours			0
with a collar round his neck and a pink lead , the man was smartly dressed in suit trousers , white shirt and black shoes as he meekly crawled after the woman through the streets of @entity15 , in the centre of the capital			1
