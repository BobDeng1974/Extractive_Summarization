you might think that storms and rising sea levels are the greatest threat to the survival of coastal cities			1
but in many waterfront megacities the ground is now dropping up to 10 times faster than the sea level is rising , experts have warned			1
the sinking of cities such as @entity12 and @entity13 is largely caused by humans pumping for groundwater and action must be taken for the cities to survive			2
sinking cities : many coastal megacities such as @entity12 ( pictured ) and @entity13 are sinking up to 10 times faster than the sea level is rising , experts have warned			1
this is largely caused by humans pumping for groundwater and action or the cities will suffer regular and dramatic flooding the ground of some coastal cities is going down up to 10 times faster than the sea level is rising and experts have blamed the extraction of groundwater			1
the practice saw @entity36 sink by two metres before it was stopped			0
land subsidence caused by groundwater extraction is contributing to larger and longer floods			1
experts are advising cities such as @entity12 and @entity13 to sop pumping for groundwater as a source of drinking water			2
in @entity48 , where pumping has stopped , the restoration of buildings which are made heavier is also contributing to subsidence			0
this also occurs naturally in coastal cities as the soil is weaker			2
megacities on the coast have already sunk below sea level and more are set to follow suit , resulting in increased damage from flooding			1
scientists at @entity60 in @entity61 studied subsidence in five coastal ‘ megacities ’ : @entity12 , @entity64 , @entity13 , @entity65 and @entity66 , which they said will sink significantly unless action is taken			1
they found that in north @entity12 , the city has sunk 4 metres in the last 35 years - a fall of 10 to 20cm per year			1
@entity36 sank by almost 7ft ( 2 metres ) until the practice of extracting groundwater from beneath parts of the city was halted and @entity48 also experienced major subsidence in the last century for the same reason			0
geologist @entity76 at the university , told @entity78 : ‘ land subsidence and sea level rise are both happening , and they are both contributing to the same problem - larger and longer floods , and bigger inundation depth of floods			1
at risk : experts have warned that subsidence is a greater risk than rising sea levels for megacities on the coast			2
the cities have already sunk below sea level and more are set to follow suit , by sinking between six and 100millimetres per year ( pictured ) ‘ the most rigorous solution and the best one is to stop pumping groundwater for drinking water , but then of course you need a new source of drinking water for these cities			1
but @entity36 did that and subsidence more or less stopped , and in @entity48 , too , they have done that			0
’ the total damage due to subsidence worldwide is estimated at billions of dollars a year and is set to increase			1
however , the problem is largely underestimated by governments			0
dr @entity113 , who presented the study to the @entity115 , explained that the consequences of floods increase due to subsidence , as areas remain deeper under water for longer			1
the risk to humans is elevated as well as the economic cost of cleaning up the mess			0
movements in the ground also lead to expensive repairs for roads , railways , water pipes and buildings			0
he believes that the extraction of water to quench the thirst of rising populations in the vast cities is the primary cause of serious subsidence , while the five cities studied also naturally experience subsidence as they are built upon weaker soil			0
@entity48 under water : @entity36 sunk by two metres until the practice of extracting groundwater from beneath parts of the city was halted and @entity48 also experienced major subsidence in the last century for the same reason			0
the @entity150 city is experiencing less flooding ( pictured ) since stopping the extraction of ground water the study shows that subsidence only occurs in the places where the groundwater is being extracted so the solution is to source clean water from elsewhere to stop structures sinking			0
‘ government bodies and inhabitants are often not aware that subsidence is an urgent problem , ’ the report says			0
while the natural reaction to flooding is often to build a barrier , if flooding is caused by subsidence , barriers will be of little help as the cause of the problem – the extraction of groundwater – has not been addressed , it says			0
the scientists recommend that subsidence should be included along with water safety in planning to keep coastal cities functioning in the long term			2
‘ in their future scenarios , many governments only target the consequences of sea level rises , but subsidence is an equally urgent issue			2
the sea is rising by 3 to 10mm a year ; the ground may sink up to 100cm a year , ’ they said .			0

ground is dropping up to 10 times faster than the sea level is rising in coastal megacities , a new study says
scientists at @entity60 in @entity61 studied subsidence in five coastal cities , including @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity66
@entity12 has sunk four metres in the last 35 years - a fall of 10 to 20cm per year and experts have called on governments to take action
land subsidence is contributing to larger , longer and deeper floods
total damage due to subsidence worldwide is estimated at billions of dollars a year and is set to increase
