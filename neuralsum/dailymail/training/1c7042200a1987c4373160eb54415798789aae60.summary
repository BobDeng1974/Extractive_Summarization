in court : @entity10 , 58 , ( right ) with his wife @entity23 ( left ) mr @entity28 said this amount of spending indicated the couple were not poor and so the court should reject their application to have the outstanding debt from the confiscation order written off			1

new career : the crime boss ( left ) claims he is working for his wife @entity23 ( right ) for free as a ' creative ' clothes designer			1

' asked whether he knew about his wife 's interior design business , he said he did but she kept it ' all away from me ' and she knew ' i get frustrated i am not bringing in money			2
she is the breadwinner , not me , and it is difficult for me anyway			0
