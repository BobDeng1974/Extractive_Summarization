a fresh racism row engulfed @entity1 tonight after it emerged a candidate described @entity3 as a ' totalitarian ideology ' that is ' against everything modern @entity6 stands for '			2
an email sent by @entity8 to the @entity10 council he wants to be elected to also claimed a row of shopping looked like ‘ @entity13 now ’ street and referred to cases where ‘ @entity16 are grooming children to be sex slaves under the eyes of the authorities ’			1
@entity21 condemned the ' deeply offensive ' views which emerged after repeated attempts by @entity24 to stress that @entity1 is not a racist party			1
@entity37 , a youth member who was previously put up to defend the party in television interviews , quit this week accusing mr @entity24 of playing the race card to win votes			1
the latest row centres on comments made in an email by mr @entity8 complaining about an alleged planning breach by ' the @entity47 community ' in @entity48 , north @entity10			1
he wrote : ‘ being muslims , they ignored both refusals and did it anyway			0
’ he claimed political correctness was preventing the council taking action ' for fear of being called racists , when , just like in all the other cases where @entity16 are grooming children to be sex slaves under the eyes of the authorities , the council does nothing '			1
the row follows the resignation of @entity37 who quit @entity1 this week , accusing mr @entity24 of playing the race card he claimed the neighbourhood was ' already exploding under the weight of segregation ' and shopkeepers had been ' squeezed out by @entity16 '			1
' the entire parade - once lovely owner / occupier shops - resembles @entity13 now			0
time to call in @entity76 and @entity77 for sure , ' he added			0
' @entity3 is a mono - cultural , totalitarian ideology			0
it is not a religion			0
it is against multi-culturalism and only promotes its own culture			0
it is against everything modern @entity6 stands for			0
' in the message , sent in the early hours of the morning to the planning enforcement department , he said that while he supported a multi-ethnic society , ' the only culture applicable to this country is @entity6 ' and warned the council not to ignore the ' winds of change '			1
the @entity21 leader of @entity48 council , @entity95 , said : ' mr @entity8 ’s odious comments are deeply offensive			1
' @entity24 keeps claiming @entity1 is n’t a racist party , but that ’s a hard pill to swallow when its members have put forward an individual with such plainly bigoted views for election to public office			1
' in @entity48 we draw strength from our diversity and the vibrancy it brings , and our community deserves better			0
' a @entity1 spokesman said : ' @entity1 is a non-racist , non-sectarian party and all candidates and members are expected to uphold these values			2
where evidence is produced to indicate a breach , it will be considered at the earliest opportunity by the national executive committee as part of an established disciplinary procedure			0
' it is a fresh embarrassment for @entity1 as it tries to fend off racism allegations following a series of scandals involving candidates , and a controversial poster campaign warning about @entity129 coming to take @entity6 jobs			0
party leader mr @entity24 has sought to dispel the image , accusing the media of stirring up hatred against @entity1 and appearing on a platform alongside a number of the party ’s black and ethnic minority candidates			1
' i do n’t care what you call us but from this moment on , please , do not ever call us a racist party			2
