organisers of a @entity2 children 's choir that has appeared on @entity3 are facing accusations they have misled the public - as the group has no formal connection to @entity7			1
while the @entity9 features a handful of children from the school , it is organised independently and led by a teacher who quit her job at a @entity12 after she was accused of theft			1
the choir , which has recorded a single of ' @entity18 ' to raise money for the town , will appear on the @entity21 's this weekend			1
it is a separate choir from the @entity24 choir that performed alongside @entity25 at the @entity26 last weekend			1
on thursday , the school district superintendent @entity27 voiced misgivings about the choir during an appearance on @entity31 after parents called her office with their concerns			2
the group does not have anything to do with @entity24 they had complained about @entity43 , who is leading the choir and runs a performing arts studio in the town , and her history with the school system , @entity41 said			1
@entity43 had been the choral director at @entity51 before she was charged with stealing through bogus expense vouchers and placed on leave in february 2005			0
she resigned in june 2005 after agreeing to pay the school board $ 11,000 , the @entity54 reported			2
@entity41 said parents were also confused whether the choir had been to the @entity26			1
those students do attend the school where a gunman killed 20 students and six women on december 14			2
' i just know that i 've got a lot of people saying , " they 're on @entity3			2
these are n't our kids , ' @entity41 said			0
' why are they using this name ? ' in charge : some parents have expressed concern that @entity43 , pictured , leads the choir as she was accused several years ago of theft			0
she has insisted it is all above board disgruntled : school district superintendent @entity27 said parents are unhappy about @entity43 's part but @entity43 said @entity3 contacted her to organise the children 's choir after learning she was a popular private music teacher working in the town			1
' everything is done by the book , ' said @entity89 , who is not paid for working with the choir			1
last month , the choir featured on the show , with many of the children saying they were desperate to do anything that would lift the spirits of the town			2
the youngsters , who range from kindergarten to 8th grade , performed ' @entity18 '			0
they recorded the song with @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 of @entity105 , and copies are being sold on @entity107 to raise funds for the @entity109			0
second choir : it is not the same choir as the one which sang with @entity25 at the @entity26 emotional moment : the children at the @entity26 are all students at @entity24 devoted : the children , from kindergarteners to 8th graders , have recording a single with @entity102 to raise money for the town			1
they said they wanted to help the victims ' families the choir has since sung the national anthem at a recent @entity128 game and will appear live via satellite at the @entity21 on sunday			1
' we 're not doing it so we can sing on @entity21 , though that 's nice , ' @entity89 told the @entity54			1
' we ’re doing it because we know we 're doing something good for the town			0
' i think it ’s wonderful that the kids are being asked to give for kids , and using their music and talent to help other kids			0
' the choir is also scheduled to perform at @entity144 in @entity145 in april			0
@entity145 producer @entity146 , who produced the @entity18 project , has defended @entity43 and the fundraising efforts			0
he said @entity41 sent him an email to stop working with @entity43			0
murdered : twenty six people were killed at @entity7 on december 14 including this first grade class ' i 'm a little sad that someone 's personal vendetta is muddying something that 's completely transparent , ' @entity146 said			2
' she attacked @entity157 and the integrity of 21 little kids			0
' he added that @entity43 does not deal with the fundraising money			0
some residents told the courant they do not care that there is a second choir representing the town			0
@entity167 , whose children used to go to @entity24 , said he thought both choirs were fantastic			2
' seeing the @entity7 chorus at the @entity26 made me really proud , ' he said			1
' and seeing [ the other choir ] sing @entity18 … that made me really proud as well			0
' video : @entity9 performs on @entity3 unfortunately your browser does not support @entity177 .			1

the choir in question is not the one which sang at the @entity26 with @entity25 - those children are from @entity24
@entity9 features a few @entity7 children but there is no formal connection with the school
choir has appeared on @entity3 and will be on the @entity21 's
it is led by teacher @entity89 who says @entity3 asked her to set it up
