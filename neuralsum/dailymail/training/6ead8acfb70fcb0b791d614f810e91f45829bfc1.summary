' @entity12 's proposal will introduce an innovative product into the market and has the potential to deliver the greatest dynamic fare benefits for consumers			2
' he added : ' we concluded that @entity12 's proposal would introduce a distinctly different product into the market and would stimulate innovation on the route as a whole , as well as satisfying and stimulating consumer demand that is currently under - served , in particular , people who prefer or are content to use @entity53			2
