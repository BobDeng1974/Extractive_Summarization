@entity0 yesterday passed an historic vote to stop tv licence fee dodgers from going to jail			0
politicians from all three main parties agreed to strip the @entity6 of its powers to prosecute viewers in the criminal courts			2
it is a victory for campaigners who compared existing laws – which allow people to be sent to prison simply because they are unable or unwilling to pay the £ 145.50 annual charge – to a ‘ banana republic ’			1
we know what you 're watching : a tv licensing enforcement official during a previous crackdown debate : the @entity6 has voiced fears that it will lose revenue if it no longer has the power to prosecute under the new proposals , fee evasion will become a civil offence punishable with a fine , similar to missing a gas bill or not paying your @entity34 subscription			2
@entity37 mp @entity36 – who jointly proposed the law change after gathering the support of 150 backbenchers – welcomed the vote , saying existing laws are a ‘ shameful blot on our justice system ’			1
the proposal also won the backing of @entity48 director @entity47 and former @entity6 chairman @entity49			1
in 2012 , 193,049 people were prosecuted for not paying their tv licence , accounting for one in nine of all magistrates ’ court cases			1
most of those found guilty were landed with penalties of up to £ 1,000 and a criminal record , and between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to pay the court fines			0
yesterday , the 19 mps on a committee considering the new @entity62 voted in favour of an amendment that could end criminal sanctions when the @entity6 ’s charter comes up for renewal in 2016			0
support : former @entity6 chairman @entity49 was in favour of a law change after 190,000 were prosecuted the change – which is expected to become law by the autumn – calls for a year - long review of @entity6 funding with detailed examination of the case for decriminalisation			1
the review ’s findings will then be presented to the @entity81 and both houses of @entity83 before further law changes end criminal sanctions for licence fee evasion			1
speaking in the @entity87 , mr @entity36 compared the @entity6 ’s current draconian powers to those of a third - world dictatorship			1
he said : ‘ imagine the condemnation if the @entity6 had learnt of a banana republic introducing a poll tax on its citizens , irrespective of income , for them to be able to have access to television			1
imagine also if this poll tax were enforced by the threat of prison sentences which disproportionately saw women with children detained by the state			0
‘ there ’s no need to imagine this scenario , because it is exactly the position we currently have in this country			0
’ detection : the @entity6 has warned taking away the threat of prosecution will lose it £ 200million a year the @entity6 warned that decriminalisation could lead to it losing £ 200million in revenue			0
however , director of corporate and public affairs @entity117 said yesterday : ‘ this approach is a sensible one as it means that all parties will be able to consider any changes to the current system with a clear understanding of the consequences that will follow			2
’ the @entity6 will become less populist and broadcast more @entity127 , opera and literary festivals , it was announced yesterday			0
director general @entity130 unveiled a series of high - brow tv programmes , including the return of history series @entity134 , and a £ 2.75 million boost to arts programming			2
he said : ‘ this is the strongest commitment to the arts we ’ve made in a generation			0
we ’re the biggest arts broadcaster in the world , but our ambition is to be even better			0

mp @entity146 said law was like one in a third world banana republic
evasion accounted for 193,049 cases in 2012 - a ninth of all in lower courts
plan to unclog courts supported by director of @entity48
