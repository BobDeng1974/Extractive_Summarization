by @entity0 and @entity1 shares in leading energy firms dropped by up to five per cent today as the markets reacted to @entity6 ’s 1970s - style plan to freeze power bills			1
energy firms said capping prices would halt the investment needed to avoid blackouts and lead to gas and electricity shortages			1
but @entity6 leader @entity14 today dismissed the ' scare stories ' which he claimed were being pedalled by the firms which have been overcharging people for years			2
but it prompted an extraordinary threat from one energy giant to quit the @entity43			0
@entity44 said it would ‘ not be economically viable to continue ’ if it had to freeze prices when its costs were rising			1
the firm ’s chairman sir @entity47 called the policy ‘ a recipe for economic ruin ’			1
shares in @entity44 , which owns @entity53 dropped by five per cent on early trading to less than 377p			2
@entity55 and @entity56 also saw shares drop in value , down more than four percent to 1,512p / @entity59 , of the @entity43 trade association , warned mr @entity14 's plan would risk jobs and threaten the energy supply			2
' freezing the bill , may be superficially attractive , but it will also freeze the money to build and renew power stations , freeze the jobs and livelihoods of the 600,000 plus people dependent on the energy industry and make the prospect of energy shortages a reality , pushing up the prices for everyone , ' she added			1
@entity77 energy secretary @entity77 said : ‘ when they tried to fix prices in @entity81 it resulted in an electricity crisis and widespread blackouts			1
we ca n’t risk the lights going out here too			0
‘ fixing prices in this way risks blackouts , jeopardises jobs and puts investment in clean , green technology in doubt			0
’ no @entity43 government has tried to fix electricity prices since the 1970s			2
@entity96 , of the @entity98 think - tank , said : ‘ @entity6 would be better off scrapping some of the excesses in green policy			2
’ but @entity102 , of the consumer group which ? , said : ‘ @entity14 ’s promise to fix the broken energy market and freeze prices will give hope to the millions worrying about how they can afford to heat their homes			1
we now look forward to seeing the detail of how this will work			0
’ on ice : @entity6 has produced models of an energy bill in a block of ice to show how the party would freeze prices for two years energy price controls contributed to devastating power cuts across large swathes of @entity81 a decade ago			1
long - term price caps in the state were identified as a major disincentive for consumers to conserve energy			2
critics said they also led to a lack of investment in energy infrastructure because the power firms , knowing they could not raise prices , had little incentive to increase output			2
crisis struck in the year 2000 and continued well into the following year			0
millions of people across the state were subject to rolling blackouts lasting for up to two hours.in the winter of 200 - 1 , children in some parts of the state were sent to school with blankets and extra clothes to keep warm and teachers handed out torches			0
american football fans were told to huddle together to watch the @entity151 to reduce the number of television sets draining power supplies			0
the power cuts led to chaotic scenes across the state , with people trapped in lifts , and traffic lights suddenly going off in the middle of the day			0
energy prices briefly jumped by as much as 800 per cent when the controls were relaxed			0
but the price controls were only part of the problem in @entity81 , which also suffered from market manipulation by some firms and illegal pipeline shutdowns by the power firm @entity170			0
under the plan , if @entity6 wins the next election it will immediately legislate to stop price rises for 20 months			0
it will save the average household £ 120 each and businesses will be £ 1,800 better off on their gas and electricity bills			2
mr @entity14 also promised to scrap the energy watchdog @entity180 and use the 20 months to overall the competition and transparency rules to smash the dominance of the @entity185 energy firms			1
@entity6 estimates it the government intervention on prices will cost the @entity185 a total of £ 4.5billion in lost profits			0
however , it is unclear what could be done to stop the energy companies from jacking up their prices on the eve of the 2015 election			1
today mr @entity14 accused the energy companies of peddling ' scare stories ' about the potential impact of the price freeze			1
he told @entity203 's @entity202 : ' i would say that they are pretty unreliable witnesses , because these are people who are overcharging people , so of course they are going to say when someone calls time on it that they are not very happy			0
' then we have got the government taking their side and saying the same thing , supporting the energy companies			0
' that 's fine , they can do that , but i am determined to make this change			0
' in a letter to the @entity185 power firms , mr @entity14 warned that if suppliers refused to work with an incoming @entity6 government to keep prices down , they risked being seen by consumers as ' part of the problem , not part of the solution '			1
but he dismissed suggestions that his plans were similar to the attempted restructuring of the energy industry in @entity81 in 2000 , which had to be scrapped amid widespread price rises , power shortages and company insolvencies			1
' there are bound to be people coming up with scare stories , the energy companies doing that , including about @entity81 , ' said the @entity6 leader			0
' @entity81 was a totally different approach			0
it was a deregulated approach , not the kind of approach we are talking about			0
' last week it emerged energy bills have almost doubled since 2000 , turning up the heat on @entity253 ’s already hard - pressed families			1
farewell : the @entity6 conference finishes in @entity255 today , with deputy leader @entity256 giving the traditional closing speech kiss : mr @entity14 was joined on the stage by his wife @entity260 who has enjoyed a much higher profile at this year 's conference mr @entity14 ’s plan comes in a week when he has lived up to his @entity14 nickname by telling @entity6 activists he is ‘ bringing back socialism ’			1
and in a confident speech at the party ’s conference yesterday he set out a defiantly socialist platform , saying that if he won power in 2015 he would : the speech delighted the @entity274 , and @entity275 , the militant leader of @entity276 , the country ’s largest union and @entity6 ’s biggest financial backer , declared : ‘ there was n’t anything you could n’t like			1
’ former @entity6 leader @entity282 , pictured in the front row of the @entity255 conference clapping and cheering , said mr @entity14 ’s vision was ‘ brilliant ’			1
in a speech shot through with attacks on @entity289 and @entity290 as out of touch with working people , mr @entity14 used the phrase ‘ @entity253 can do better than this ’ 17 times to wild applause and repeated standing ovations from @entity6 activists			1
he claimed the prime minister could never ‘ walk in the shoes ’ of those who were struggling to get by and would always stand up for the rich and powerful			0
attack : mr @entity14 accused big business of a ' race to the bottom ' as he pledged to increase the minimum wage and take on rogue employers and landlords race to the top : mr @entity14 said he would take on energy companies , train firms and payday lenders who rip people off pitch : mr @entity14 became increasingly animated as he delivered his speech to the packed conference hall he , by contrast , would fight for workers and had confronted vested interests on media regulation and tobacco controls			1
mr @entity14 claimed a ‘ vital link between the growing wealth of the country and your family finances ’ had been broken and restoring it was his ‘ central purpose ’			1
mr @entity289 , he said , was ‘ going on a lap of honour ’ having started to turn the economy around but should instead be doing a ‘ lap of shame ’ for delivering the slowest recovery in 100 years			0
‘ @entity253 ca n’t win a race for the fewest rights at work against the sweat shops of the world , ’ he insisted			0
looking left : many of the policies unveiled by mr @entity14 were seen as stridently left - wing ‘ they used to say a rising tide lifts all boats			2
now the rising tide just seems to lift yachts			0
’ he also promised his government would build 200,000 homes a year by 2020 , and suggested councils would be given powers to override the objections of neighbouring authorities seeking to block development			2
he said @entity6 would allow the compulsory purchase of land that has planning permission but has not been developed			0
mr @entity14 spared the @entity77 , prompting speculation he is leaving the door open to a future power - sharing deal with them			2
@entity6 says the power bills policy would save households an average of £ 120 over two years while costing energy firms £ 4.5billion			1
strident : in what was seen as one of the most left - wing speeches by a mainstream leader for decades , mr @entity14 vowed to seize land from developers and fix energy prices cheers : the speech , delivered without notes , was given a rapturous reception in the conference hall front row : comedian @entity377 , musician @entity378 , campaigner baroness @entity30 and @entity379			1

@entity14 said he would ' fix power bills until 2017 ' if he won next election
but energy industry warns it will lead to gas and electricity shortages
