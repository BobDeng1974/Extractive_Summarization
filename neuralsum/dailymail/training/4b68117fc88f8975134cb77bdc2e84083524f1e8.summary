updated : 07:49 est , 10 january 2012 experts found evidence of animals forming cliques and gathering information to help make group decisions - in much the same way as humans use @entity8 to streamline discussions humans did n't invent ' social networks ' , says a new study into animal behaviour - instead , our use of networks such as @entity8 and @entity17 actually mirrors group behaviours that can be found in whales , monkeys and dolphins			1
intelligent animals ' use ' groups to share information with one another - albeit without computers or smartphones - just like humans do online			1
experts found evidence of animals forming cliques and gathering information to help make group decisions - in much the same way as humans use @entity8 to streamline discussions			1
the famous ' six degrees of separation ' rule - which states that anyone can be related to another person in six steps - also applies to the way animals group with one another			1
the findings apply across dolphins , whales , primates and hooved animals			1
the sharing of information through social networking sites like @entity17 and @entity8 actually reflects tactics animals have always used to gather information about their social environment			1
the study was conducted by dr @entity57 , of the @entity59 ’s @entity58			0
he said : ' social networks are the same across all species and , whilst details of their structure may differ , some properties remain the same whether we are looking at killer whales , spider monkeys or , indeed , humans			2
' ' for example , the famous concept of six degrees of separation - the idea that everyone is linked by common acquaintances to any other person on @entity75 - holds true across the animal kingdom			1
' ' our studies into animal populations showed the ‘ small world effect ’ is prevalent in the animal kingdom			2
' ' also , we see cliques form in different species of animals in the same way as we ourselves experience in our day - to - day lives			0
' dr @entity57 will discuss his findings in a talk next week as part of the university ’s @entity94 series			0
he said : ' i will explain that the driver behind the formation of social networks in the animal kingdom is information - gathering			2
' ' this information differs between species and populations - so it could be where food is , where predators are , or how strong you are in comparison to the other animals around you which would make you more of less likely to win in a fight			2
' “ schools of dolphins provide an example of this			0
as individuals , dolphins have their own daily needs to fulfil , such as resting and eating , but they are also concerned with what they should do next as a group			0
' “ we find that group leaders can emerge simply in particular cases because they might know the current context better than other members of the group			0
' dr @entity57 believes the evolution of social media mimics the evolution of social networks in the animal kingdom			0
he said : ' the social - networking technology most of us now employ on a daily basis helps us to behave at a global scale in the same way we do with people we see every day			0
' ' it ’s allowing us to share information with one another in the way that animals across the kingdom have always communicated , the only difference being that we can do it on a global level			1
' ' in many ways the evolution of social media is converging with the evolution of the way animals use social information			2
' his talk , entitled did @entity17 ? , will take place at @entity157 ’s @entity156 in @entity59 at 7pm next wednesday .			0

animal groups share information like @entity8 groups
behaviours found in dolphins , whales , monkeys and hoofed animals
' six degrees of separation ' rule also applies to animals
