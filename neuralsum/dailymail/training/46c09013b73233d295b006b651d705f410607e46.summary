one advantage of the @entity1 clashing with the city 's fashion week is that you just ca n't move for supermodels — both on and off the automotive catwalk			2
@entity7 over here one minute , @entity9 's @entity8 over there the next			1
and then there are the cars			2
although @entity15 chic was all across the metropolis , the @entity13 did their best to upstage their @entity18 hosts by sticking the @entity9 boot in — wellingtons of course			1
@entity27 chief executive dr @entity38 said : ' these two cars are at the very heart of @entity9 's manufacturing renaissance			1
' @entity8 led the charge by swapping the catwalk for the new @entity36 's launch on the @entity45			1
the 27 - year - old actress and former @entity48 lingerie model boarded a giant 250ft barge , transformed into floating off - road assault course adorned with seven pairs of oversized @entity53 boots — one of them a 15ft - high pair decorated in the red white and blue @entity26			0
two of the new vehicles then drove around the course as the barge sailed up and down past many of the capital 's most famous landmarks , including the @entity62 and @entity64 cathedral — under the very put - out noses of haughty @entity66			2
a spokesman said : ' the boots , a reference to both the @entity71 's versatile seating layout and @entity27 's unique take on outdoor life , brought a sense of quintessential @entity9 heritage and humour to the @entity77			1
' @entity7 scored highly in the fashion stakes when she unveiled the new @entity79			1
' it 's chic , just like @entity15 , ' she said of the hot hatchback the seven pairs of giant wellies , made by @entity9 firm @entity84 and becoming something of a fashion statement in @entity15 , were designed to highlight the @entity89 's seating versatility — two people at the front , three in the middle and two more in the optional folddown seats at the back			1
costing from £ 32,395 to £ 42,995 , the new car replaces the @entity97 and means an investment , production and jobs boost for the firm 's @entity102 factory on @entity104			2
it goes on @entity9 sale on january 22 alongside the existing the larger seven - seater , full - size discovery			2
the launch model will deploy an efficient , yet powerful , @entity110 fourcylinder diesel engine , four - wheel drive , with either advanced ninespeed automatic or six - speed manual transmission			0
an @entity114 turbodiesel version is to be introduced later in 2015 from under £ 30,000 and with frugal co2 estimated at around 119g/km			0
@entity116 launched its new £ 252,200 @entity117 with a top speed of 190mph and acceleration from rest to 60mph of 4.8 seconds			0
the @entity123 has also received 1,200 orders in three weeks the @entity126 - based luxury car maker , owned by @entity128 's giant @entity127 , has recorded its best - ever half - year sales of 5,252 , a rise of 23 per cent			1
it is to launch a new suv in 2016 , creating 400 new jobs			0
@entity137 makers are slashing prices and offering great deals to @entity9 consumers because @entity9 is the only country showing good sales growth			2
' it 's all about growth			0
everyone wants a piece of the action			0
the last quarter has been particularly competitive , ' said one executive			0
@entity7 scored highly in the fashion stakes when she unveiled the new @entity79			1
' it 's chic , just like @entity15 , ' she said of the hot hatchback in what , quite frankly , a rather cheesy and stilted bit of @entity154 - style scripting			1
but the @entity79 is a significant car for @entity9			1
it was the second biggest - selling car after the @entity158 at 83,000 last year — it 's actually the biggest seller in @entity160			0
but @entity161 , @entity116 and @entity27 led the @entity9 charge of luxury cars at the prestigious motor show as booming export sales propelled them towards new record highs			2
luxury car brand @entity167 produced a bit of a head - turner			0
its eye - catching @entity171 prototype is a four - door ' fastback ' with four individual leather seats , while a plunging panoramic glass roof creates a light , airy environment inside			0
@entity161 is on a roll , ' said the firm 's chief executive @entity178 , as he revealed that the luxury firm , based at @entity181 in @entity182 , is on target to break through 4,000 annual sales for the first time			1
no doubt it 'll be helped by a raunchy black - andwhite , art - house style video involving a suspenderclad @entity188 getting changed in the back of a roller which was shown at a private view at the show , after appearing at some of her concerts			0
apparently it 's called ' skirt ' , though i struggled to see much evidence of one .			0

@entity123 has also received 1,200 orders in three weeks
chief executive dr @entity38 said the cars are ' at the very heart of @entity9 's manufacturing renaissance '
@entity8 was the face of the @entity36 's launch
@entity7 unveiled the new @entity79
' it 's chic , just like @entity15 , ' she said of the hot hatchback
