by @entity0 last updated at 4:36 pm on 17th february 2012 an inconsolable mother has told of her heartbreak after an @entity4 soldier died before a helicopter could get him to hospital in @entity7			1
it took a medical evacuation team 59 minutes to get @entity11 specialist @entity10 to a hospital , after receiving a call that a roadside bombing had severed three of his limbs			1
the rescue helicopter was unable to swoop in for the pickup until another armed chopper arrived to provide cover			1
' he was alive , he was conscious and now i have the question of if they have got to him in less time would he be here ? ' , @entity31 said			0
‘ it has devastated us all that this young man who happens to be my son was alive and conscious			0
everybody was solely on he was going to make it			0
' the rescue of the 1st @entity45 , 1st @entity47 soldier , filmed by an embedded journalist @entity48 , during which the soldier is writhing in pain , shows war at its most agonising			1
after the explosion , @entity10 's fellow soldiers applied tourniquets to stop his bleeding			1
they were hopeful that he might survive even though both of his legs and most of his left arm were severed in the blast			0
' i need something , please			0
it hurts , ' @entity10 , a 24 - year - old combat engineer from @entity65 , can be heard saying on the tape			1
the pre-dawn pickup zone in the @entity69 district of @entity71 province was considered ' hot , ' meaning the medevac could not swoop in for the pickup until another chopper with firepower arrived to provide cover			1
heavy burden : @entity78 said the entire family is devastated by her son 's death heartbreak : @entity82 and her nine - year old son , @entity10 's stepson have to live with the knowledge that @entity10 may have lived if he 'd got to hospital faster family man : the helicopter carrying specialist @entity10 was delayed as it was forced to wait for an armed escort , leaving his family with unanswered questions heartfelt grief : @entity10 left behind his wife @entity82 and her son , pictured , as well as a sister and three brothers and his mother and father there was a delay but after concluding that no armed escort helicopters already in the air could be dispatched to the rescue , the @entity11 summoned an armed @entity105 ah - 64 helicopter , parked at @entity71 , to the scene along with the medevac			1
the medevac crew loaded @entity10 aboard in two minutes and whisked him to the hospital			1
the @entity11 's goal is to get the most critically injured troops , or category a patients , to a medical facility within 60 minutes			0
@entity10 reached the hospital one minute within the goal			1
last year 167 @entity120 missions took longer than 60 minutes , nine of them because the medevac was waiting for an air weapons team , the army said			0
none of these delays affected the outcome for the patient , according to the @entity11			0
helicopters fly in pairs in @entity7			2
if both were armed , critics point out , would n't be needed and both could evacuate patients from the battlefield			2
ms. @entity78 is convinced that her son , who leaves a wife and stepson , would still be alive had he gotten there sooner			0
she said : ' i feel like they should be armed			0
why are n't they armed ? these young men and women are risking their lives , ' ' he might be an amputee with three prosthetic limbs , but he would be here			2
' mission : the @entity11 's goal is to get the most critically injured troops , or category a patients , to a medical facility within 60 minutes rescue operation : the @entity11 's goal is to get the most critically injured troops , or category a patients , to a medical facility within 60 minutes saving lives : medivac helicopters are currently unarmed and need to be escorted when in ' hot ' areas among her questions : if the landing zone was in such a hot zone , why was n't there already an armed helicopter providing air support for the soldiers on the ground ? ' on the video , it did n't seem like there was fighting going on , ' she said			1
pilots , crew and medics who fly @entity7 in 78 medevacs have a sole mission of recovering the wounded			2
add guns to their helicopters and they would become a fighting aircraft too , says the @entity11 , which reviewed the issue in 2008 and decided to keep the medevacs unarmed			0
the @entity11 says armed escorts are mandatory for hot pickup zones			0
the requirement for an armed escort when militants are merely in the area is based on a risk assessment by aviation commanders and troops on the ground			1
@entity11 officials say that waiting for an escort is rare , and that installing machine guns , ammunition and soldiers to man them would add roughly 600 pounds to a medevac chopper			2
that extra weight would limit its ability to fly in some high - altitude areas of @entity7 and reduce the number of patients who could be evacuated at a time			2
' they try to lighten the aircraft as much as they can			0
they do all kinds of stuff , ' said maj. gen. @entity214 , surgeon general of @entity4 forces in @entity7			2
' weight is their enemy			0
they need to get lift and you need to get speed			0
' unlike the @entity11 medevacs , which are emblazoned with red crosses , the @entity223 , @entity224 and the @entity227 fly search - and - rescue and medevac missions with armed aircraft			2
they do not have red crosses , which can be displayed only on unarmed aircraft , according to the @entity234			0
action : about 20 @entity4 lawmakers have written to military officials inquiring about @entity10 's death weight gain : army officials say that waiting for an escort is rare , and that installing machine guns , ammunition and soldiers to man them would add roughly 600 pounds to a medevac chopper @entity4 military officials also say that door guns ca n't match the precision firepower unleashed by @entity105 helicopters , which often escort medevacs			1
limiting collateral damage is critical in @entity7 where the death of civilians and destruction of property has put the @entity4 - led coalition force at odds with the @entity7 people			2
' i just do n't see the precision fire capability that this fight really requires , especially when you 've got aircraft around that are specifically designed with hellfire missiles , .30mm cannons with laser range finding , ' said col. @entity266 of @entity267 , @entity268 , who commands the 82nd @entity270 based at @entity271			0
' you 're not going to get that out of any door gun on the side of an aircraft			0
' critics of the policy , including @entity48 , say the @entity11 's arguments for keeping medevacs unarmed are flawed			0
a medevac helicopter pilot flying in @entity7 , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared repercussions from his superiors , challenged the @entity11 's belief that weighing down medevacs with guns would result in fewer wounded troops being evacuated			1
the issue is not how many patients can fit in a helicopter , but how many patients the single medic aboard can treat at a time — and that is one , the pilot said			0
he said waiting a long time for an escort is not common — but one time is one too many			2
in @entity10 's case , had the medevac been armed , it could have had @entity10 airborne and flying to a hospital within 12 minutes of his unit calling for a medevac , @entity48 said			1
also , armed @entity309 helicopters equipped with door guns that were parked in @entity71 at the time could have picked up @entity10 and delivered him to a hospital in fewer than 35 minutes , he said			1
these helicopters often assist with medevac missions , but their primary mission is for personnel rescue and recovery			0
about 20 @entity4 lawmakers have written to military officials inquiring @entity10 's death			1
in a february 7 letter to a lawmaker , @entity4 gen. @entity321 , chairman of the @entity322 , said the @entity325 , which oversees @entity7 , would be directed to review guidelines on the use of escort aircraft			1
the @entity11 boasts that a service member wounded in @entity7 currently stands a 92 percent chance of surviving — the best rate of any @entity332 was among the 8 percent who did n't			1
watch the video @entity335 soldier @entity10 killed in @entity7 's @entity336 : @entity337			1

specialist @entity10 was killed in @entity71 , @entity7 last september
embedded journalist filmed the rescue with @entity10 heard *speaking*
helicopter was delayed waiting for armed escort
@entity10 's mother says he might have been saved if the helicopter had n't been forced to wait
