bold move : @entity1 is to freeze household energy prices until january 2016 , leading to calls for its rivals to do the same @entity6 's second - biggest energy firm has announced it will axe hundreds of jobs and slash spending on wind farms to fund a freeze on gas and electricity bills			1
however , there are already many cheaper deals available which last for even longer – including one from @entity1 itself			1
the decision by @entity1 means the average standard tariff dual - fuel bill for those paying by cheque or cash will be held at £ 1,266 until january 2016			1
it represents a remarkable u-turn for the company , which had argued that a price freeze would be dangerous when the idea was put forward by @entity26 leader @entity25 last autumn			1
the move also heaps pressure on the other major players to follow suit			1
@entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 have also argued against price freezes			2
the news triggered a heated row at @entity40 ’s questions as @entity41 and the @entity26 leader squabbled over who should take credit			2
for months , the prime minister ridiculed @entity26 ’s pledge to freeze energy prices if it wins the next election as a ‘ price con ’ that was impossible to deliver because of fluctuating global prices			1
but mr @entity25 insisted the decision by @entity1 meant mr @entity41 ’s argument had been ‘ totally demolished ’			1
the decision puts at risk billions of pounds of investment in plans to build and operate wind turbines over the next 20 years			1
one of a number of schemes being shelved by @entity1 is its involvement in the @entity66 scheme off the coast of @entity68 , which has the potential to be the largest in the world and produce almost 10 per cent of the @entity6 ’s electricity needs			1
@entity72 , founder of green energy firm @entity73 , said : ‘ there is so much political pressure on the industry we are seeing companies make wrong , short - term decisions and fail to invest in renewable energy			1
‘ @entity1 is cutting 500 jobs and dumping offshore wind projects			1
it shows how broken the industry is that these sacrifices have to be made for short - term price stability			2
’ @entity1 said the freeze is possible as it plans to cut costs by £ 100million , axe 500 jobs and cancel spending on new wind farms			1
six months ago , @entity1 chief executive @entity89 dismissed @entity26 ’s price freeze plan as ‘ unsustainable ’			1
yesterday he said : ‘ we ’re responding to questions that have been asked of us with a positive agenda for customers , including the longest ever unconditional energy price freeze			1
’ however , the firm ’s new deal is still more expensive than others available			2
and even @entity1 itself has a tariff that holds prices until march 2017 and comes in at an annual average of £ 1,186 , a saving of around £ 80 a year , although it has to be paid monthly by direct debit			1
@entity105 , of price comparison website @entity106 , said : ‘ those paying the provider ’s standard prices could still save money by switching to a cheaper tariff			0
' there are seven tariffs where the price is fixed until 2016 and five fixed until 2017			0
’ @entity118 , of customer watchdog @entity116 , said : ‘ a freeze at current electricity prices will provide security and reassurance for millions of consumers , even if it will not reduce the burden on households struggling to afford to keep their homes warm			2
’ labour leader @entity25 said the @entity1 price freeze was a vindication for his own policy but prime minister @entity41 said it was the result of government cuts to green levies breakdown : according to @entity134 these are the elements that make up the average energy bill the number of people switching energy supplier is lower now than a decade ago , a study shows			1
in 2003 a total of 7.26million switched gas and electricity supplier , compared to only 5.88million in 2013			0
the numbers peaked in 2008 at 9.58million and have been falling ever since			0
the research was carried out by @entity146 which is arranging collective switching so a large group of customers can secure a better deal			0
it found that despite what @entity152 and the @entity153 claim the amount of switching is lower now than it was ten years ago			0
@entity157 , co-founder of @entity146 , said : ' @entity152 and the @entity153 claim that the market is working because more and more people are switching			0
' the truth is the opposite			0
there are less switches now than ten years ago			0
investigating the @entity153 is long overdue but people need help with their bills now			0
' a review will take years to complete and even longer to implement			0
people can rightly ask how many more winters will go by before bills come down ? the @entity146 will deliver cheaper energy now by harnessing people power to get a better deal			0
