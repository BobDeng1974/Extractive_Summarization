by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has been impressed by @entity4 's attitude and aptitude since arriving at @entity6 - no more so than when he overcame an early penalty miss against @entity8 to set his side on course for the @entity12 group stage			1
spurs continued their 100 per cent start to life under the former @entity17 international by comfortably overcoming the @entity18 3 - 0 in the second leg of their play - off on thursday evening			1
already boasting a 2 - 1 lead from the first leg in @entity18 , the north @entity23 never looked like falling to a shock exit and secured their place in friday 's draw as @entity28 and @entity29 added to @entity4 's first - half opener			1
it was no less than @entity4 deserved after another fine display and was a particularly impressive response to seeing his penalty saved after just 14 minutes			2
' i have always believed in @entity4 since the first day , ' @entity2 said			1
i think it is possible to miss penalties , but it is not important			0
' he found a way to score , to play and did not let it affect his performance			0
' he showed character and personality			0
he has a very strong mind and @entity4 is a very good player , too			2
' brave : the @entity6 youngster stepped up to take an early penalty but missed from the spot @entity4 may well have been impacted by the lengthy wait he had before his penalty after @entity8 goalkeeper @entity73 sustained a nasty - looking blow to the head in taking down @entity76			1
the @entity77 was taken to hospital with what @entity8 manager @entity37 described as a ' bad situation ' and @entity2 was quick to send his best to the goalkeeper			2
' maybe it affected @entity4 , ' he said			2
' i hope the keeper is okay and makes a good , quick recovery			0
' back - up goalkeeper @entity87 kept out @entity4 's spot - kick and had to be at his best to stop @entity6 racking up an even bigger scoreline			1
@entity2 was delighted with his side 's display , especially given he made nine changes from sunday 's 4 - 0 win against @entity94			1
perseverance : @entity4 was rewarded with a beautifully composed opening goal asked about @entity29 - called up by @entity97 despite being omitted from the squad to face the @entity99 - @entity2 said : ' it is good for him and other players that got 90 minutes and for the confidence			1
' we have a lot of players , a very good squad and my job is just to choose the players for each squad			0
' i am very happy , very pleased with the team			0
it was a very good performance today			0
' there are no easy games because the @entity12 is difficult to play , but we played very , very , very well against @entity116			2
' selected : @entity6 winger @entity29 has been called up to the @entity97 squad @entity2 said on the eve of the match that he had no intention in letting @entity29 or @entity121 leave before the end of the transfer window			1
@entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 are amongst the other players to have been linked with a move away and @entity2 suggested there may well be movement before monday 's deadline			0
' we have a lot of players with unbelievable quality , ' he said			0
' we need balance and it is possible we add some players , but not too much movement before the end of the transfer window			0

@entity2 impressed with @entity6 performance against @entity8 as @entity6 *progressed* to @entity12 group stage
@entity17 happy with @entity4 who scored opener after missing penalty early on
