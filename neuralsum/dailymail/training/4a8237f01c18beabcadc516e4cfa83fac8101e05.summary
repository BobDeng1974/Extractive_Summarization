in the early years of shirt numbers in football , a player 's position determined what he wore on his back			1
defenders had two to six , wingers seven or 11 , and strikers either nine or 10			0
but recent decades have seen a considerable shift			0
goalkeepers with no 9 , midfielders with no 1 , and even small mathematical sums have made it on to the back of players ' shirts			2
with @entity18 moving to @entity19 and wearing his favoured no 45 shirt , @entity17 looks at some of the strangest choices , and the reasoning behind them			1
but when his form earned him a move to @entity37 , the no 9 shirt was already taken by @entity39			1
with his second choice , no 10 , occupied by @entity43 the former @entity41 man was forced to improvise			0
@entity44 went for no 18 , but inserted a small plus sign in between the two numbers so that it added up to nine			1
sums : when @entity44 moved to @entity37 his favourite @entity49 9 shirt was taken , so he opted for one plus eight this tactic has been copied since by a number of players including @entity53 at @entity54 and @entity55 at @entity56			1
@entity57 at the 1982 @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity58 decided to organise their squad numbers alphabetically			0
for @entity57 , this meant enjoying the novelty of being one of the few outfield players ever to wear the no 1 shirt			0
the only member of the squad that this rule did not apply to was @entity70 , who wore his favourite no 10 shirt ( he would have been no 12 otherwise )			2
@entity73 , who wore the no 1 shirt at @entity74 , said he did so because of his admiration for @entity76			1
alphabetical : @entity57 ( left ) wears his no 1 shirt but an exception was made for @entity70 lucky : @entity18 has worn no 45 at every club he has played for because it is his ' lucky ' number @entity18 @entity19 's latest signing has worn the no 45 shirt at @entity37 , @entity84 , @entity85 and now at @entity86			1
although there had been rumours that the @entity89 forward had chosen 45 because the two numbers add up to nine , @entity18 insisted it was because the number brings him luck			1
he said : ' when i first played three or four games with @entity37 , when i was young , i had no 45 because the numbers for young players were from @entity98 to no 50			2
' i took no 45 because i was joking that four plus five is nine - and i scored in all four games			2
it brings me luck and that 's why i 've always kept @entity98 45			1
' @entity103 a recipient of @entity108 's fabled no 7 shirt for the majority of his career , the former @entity105 captain did n't have it all his own way when he moved to @entity32 in 2003			1
his preferred shirt number was then occupied by @entity32 's legendary forward @entity113			2
unperturbed , @entity103 opted for the no 23 instead			1
the reason , @entity103 claimed , was that @entity115 had worn the same number at the @entity117			1
admiration : when @entity103 moved to @entity32 he chose no 23 because he was a fan of @entity115 @entity85 trio in 2008 , @entity85 signed @entity121 , @entity24 and @entity122			1
but the preferred squad numbers for all three players were already occupied			0
as a result they chose to be numbers 76 , 80 and 84 respectively - the years in which they were born			2
@entity129 the @entity131 goalkeeper , who played 130 games for his country , opted for the no 9 shirt			2
@entity129 had been a striker as a youth player and despite his success at the other end of the pitch he never lost the desire to play outfield			0
birthday : @entity142 wore @entity24 's favourite no 10 at @entity37 so he chose 80 instead ( born in 1980 ) @entity144 @entity146 's attack - minded goalkeeper has scored more than 100 goals for the @entity149 club			1
while he normally plays in the no 1 shirt , he has experimented with a slightly more unusual option			0
in 2005 he broke the appearance record for the @entity146 and wore no 618 - the number of matches he had played for them - in a match against @entity156			1
ronaldo after an incredible career that took him from @entity159 and @entity160 to @entity37 and @entity32 , @entity39 moved to @entity85 where he adopted the no 99 shirt			1
after numerous rumours that his new number was born out of his love for 99 @entity167 ice creams , the @entity149 striker clarified the situation			2
he said that @entity169 was already occupying the no 9 shirt he wanted , so he chose 99 instead			1
@entity39 also played for @entity171 in the no 99 shirt for one match to celebrate the club 's 99th anniversary			1
@entity176 when the @entity178 full - back returned for a second spell at @entity180 he decided to get a new number on the back of his shirt			2
after some crude speculation the @entity59 winner revealed he had opted for @entity186 because he was born in 1969 and was 1.69 metres tall			0
speculation : @entity176 said he chose @entity98 69 because it was the year he was born and he was 1.69m tall alias : as well as being a footballer @entity189 is also a rapper called @entity190 , so he chose no 2 at @entity191 @entity189 after spending the majority of his career in @entity105 with the no 23 , @entity189 was forced to change when he moved to @entity191			1
instead , the @entity195 chose @entity98 2			2
the reason being that in @entity189 's other career ( as a rapper ) his alias is ' @entity201 '			1
@entity202 after moving to @entity204 in 2000 , @entity203 striker @entity202 became the first and last player ever to wear the no 0 shirt in @entity208 football history			0
@entity202 chose the number as he was nicknamed ' zero '			1
both the @entity210 and @entity211 outlawed it the following year			0
@entity213 the @entity215 striker predominantly cause headlines for off - field reasons during his time at @entity219 , and in 2009 his name hit the headlines when he changed his shirt number shortly before the start of the new season			2
@entity213 chose the @entity98 52 , which he said was lucky for him - although there was considerable speculation that it was linked to his weekly pay packet			0
he did at least offer to cover the costs for fans who had bought his old shirt			0
he said : ' i appreciate that a good number of fans have bought their kits for 2009/10 already with names and numbers printed up so i ’d like to personally cover the cost of replacing anyone ’s shirt that has my previous number			0
' unique : @entity202 became the first and last player ever to wear the no 0 shirt in @entity208 football @entity245 the right fielder who played for the @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 was incredibly superstitious			0
@entity245 insisted on having the number 33 shirt throughout his career because three was his lucky number			0
he did n't stop there , though			0
@entity245 also insisted his phone numbers had as many threes in them as possible and got married on november 3 at 3.33pm			0
@entity257 five - time @entity258 champion @entity257 is far from shy when it comes to making a statement			0
and the former @entity117 man was no different when it came to his shirt numbers			0
@entity257 was the first player in @entity258 history to wear both the no 91 shirt			0
@entity257 wore it because the two numbers add up to 10 , the number he wanted , which was occupied by @entity269 when he moved to @entity270			1
obsessed : @entity245 wanted is many threes in his life as possible , including on his shirt			0

@entity18 has always worn no 45 because it brings him luck
@entity44 wore eight plus one because @entity39 was no 9
@entity103 reveals his admiration for *basketball* legend @entity115
@entity189 chose @entity191 number based on his rap name
