although he seemed to have forgotten all about it on friday , @entity0 has been here before			1
it was in may 1992 that the @entity3 took his young @entity5 team to @entity6 for a post-season friendly to mark @entity9 ’s success in winning the @entity10			1
for the @entity12 it was an afternoon of celebration			0
for @entity15 , though , it was just another step on the way to building his great @entity5 team			1
the @entity21 club had just won the @entity23 - @entity15 ’s first trophy at the club - but it was to be another two years before he guided them to the @entity3 championship and three before they lifted the @entity28			1
@entity15 had to be prompted to remember the game but then said : ‘ it ’s a long time ago but yes , i know about that game as i was there			1
more importantly , though , it was also a step in the process for me with @entity5			1
‘ that is what i talk about here			0
we won the @entity23 in the first year but had to wait for other things			1
then we won the domestic cup , another step in the process			1
‘ this game at @entity9 will be difficult for us			2
it ’s not a big stadium or a big pitch so it will be a fantastic atmosphere and i believe the supporters shall stimulate the players of @entity9			2
‘ it ’s also a derby , they will play with a lot of passion , a lot of long balls			0
you have to fight against it			0
‘ it will be a very difficult game but we have to show we can play football , that we can pass the ball in spite of the pressure of @entity9			2
’ skills : @entity37 will showcase his talent during his @entity33 debut against @entity9 on saturday @entity15 was in bullish mood despite the fact that his squad will arrive at @entity6 on saturday missing 10 players through injury and new defender @entity86 because of work permit issues			1
the @entity3 coach ’s message remains the same			2
if he is given time and shown patience then he will bring success to @entity33			2
on friday he even challenged the media to get behind him			0
‘ we can be the champions still in @entity96 now , in my first year , ’ said @entity15			1
‘ maybe you shall laugh , but also in my former clubs i have started like this , so for me it ’s not big news or different , because i have already said that			2
‘ but you have to survive as a trainer - coach , as a manager			2
you have to survive , because , nowadays , the fans are asking for results and this is the question : can i receive enough time to do all the steps we have to do ? talking tactics : @entity0 gives some advice to his players during a training session on friday opposition : @entity15 and @entity33 will face @entity116 ( pictured ) and his @entity9 side on saturday ‘ maybe you ( the media ) can support @entity0			1
do you believe in him ? yes ? ok			0
what a fantastic end , a fantastic end			0
’ there is , of course , no reason for @entity15 to feel under undue pressure			2
much has conspired against him since the season started			0
nevertheless , he does need a result on saturday after taking only a point from @entity35 games against @entity130 and @entity131 and losing 4 - 0 in the @entity132 to @entity133			1
new signing @entity37 will go straight into @entity33 ’s team against @entity9 and may find himself alongside players such as @entity137 and @entity138 , even though both know they are not wanted by the new manager			1
laughter : @entity141 enjoys a joke during training ahead of @entity33 's trip to @entity9 surplus : the unwanted dup of @entity137 ( pictured ) and @entity138 could feature against @entity9 asked about this , @entity15 said : ‘ i am not a short - term coach			1
i am thinking always for the long - term			0
you have to take measures that are not good for the short term but better for the long term of the club			0
‘ that may not be good for me as a coach			0
but i am not here for me myself as a coach			0
i am here for the club			0
’ details of @entity5 ’s game with @entity9 22 years ago are so hard to come by that only a @entity9 fans ’ website threw up the attendance ( a little more than 10,000 ) and the scoreline ( 1 - 0 to @entity5 ) while it is unlikely that @entity15 himself will remember much about the goalscorer that day , one @entity168			1
glory : @entity15 led @entity5 to the @entity28 trophy in 1995 after building a young side over many years return : @entity15 ( right ) and his young @entity5 team visited @entity6 in a pre-season friendly in 1992 certainly saturday ’s game will be remembered a little longer and the @entity33 manager can only hope for a similar result			1
‘ i am confident about things here , ’ he stressed			0
‘ because everywhere i have been before i have showed it			0
not because of other things			0
‘ i do n’t believe my philosophy wo n’t work at @entity33			2
i believe that at the end of the process i think everybody will be happy that i was here			0

@entity0 believes @entity33 can win @entity35 this year
@entity3 says his record with previous clubs proves it is possible
@entity33 have claimed just one points from their opening two league *fixtures*
@entity15 's side take on @entity9 at @entity6 on saturday , kick - off *12.45pm*
he brought his young @entity5 side to @entity6 in may 1992 during pre-season
@entity5 won 1 - 0 , @entity15 recalling ' it was step in the process ' for @entity3 side
@entity37 will make his @entity33 debut but @entity86 *unavailable*
unwanted *duo* of @entity137 and @entity138 could feature for @entity33
