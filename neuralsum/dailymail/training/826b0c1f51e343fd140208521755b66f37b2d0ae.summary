in may 2009 , @entity25 claimed publishing the pictures would inflame anti-american feeling in @entity4 and @entity5			2
' we 're not dismissive of the fact that some people could react badly to the publishing of the photographs , ' @entity40 lawyer @entity39 told @entity46			2
' but this does not mean that there should be a massive heckler 's veto that terrorist organizations can wield over the public 's right to know			0
