by @entity0 published : 03:14 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 03:43 est , 24 june 2013 it ’s been a bit of a mad week for me – it was my 23rd birthday last week and i celebrated in style ! while experimenting with different beauty looks before the big night , i found one i particularly love , taking inspiration from the metallic beauty looks that were all over the @entity10 catwalks : @entity12 nails , gold on the eyes – even gold lips ! i ’ve taken my favourite elements of these looks to create the ultimate @entity19 - style golden goddess look , featuring warm , shimmery skin and a dazzling gold eye			1
it ’s great for a night out , and looks amazing against a bronzed bod			2
it ’s also surprisingly easy to achieve – here ’s how i did it			2
golden girl : @entity0 loves gold nails , gold on the eyes - even gold lips and here she shows you how to get the look at home to achieve the shimmery skin i wanted i used the @entity34 , which can be worn alone or under foundation			1
this product is loaded with shimmery pigments that really illuminate the skin and bring it to life , as well as adding some sheer coverage			2
i gently dabbed it to the skin and blended it in with my fingers ; you do n’t need too much of it , just a few squeezes of the pump are enough to provide a beautifully glowing base			2
how to do @entity50 the main attraction in this look is of course the glittering gold eye			1
to create this i used the @entity56 in @entity57 , packing the colour all the way over my eyelid as well as on my lower lash line			0
the eyeshadow is super-pigmented and creamy , it glides on like a dream ! i then added some warmth to my glittering gold eyes by applying @entity67 ’s @entity66 to my socket lids			1
i did this with an angled brush , concentrating on the outer corners for a winged effect			0
the gorgeous bronze colour works really well against the gold			1
do n’t be scared to experiment with beauty products , make - up is all about having fun after all ! @entity79 eye : the main attraction in this look is of course the glittering gold eye and do n't be scared to experiment next , to add some depth to my eyes , i applied the @entity86 on my upper and lower waterlines			1
this really makes the eyes pop. i then covered my lashes with @entity91 , which both lengthens and volumises the lashes without making them clump together			0
you all know how much i love my bronzer , and this look is all about looking golden and gorgeous , so i decided to use another bronzing product – the @entity98 – to sculpt my face			0
first , i swept the lighter shade in the palette under my cheekbones , across my temples and down the sides of my nose			0
this light shade contours the face and makes it look slimmer			0
i then moved on to the darker shade , which i applied across my cheekbones to really warm up my skintone			0
shimmer girl : you do n't have to stop at the face - you can accentuate your shoulders and décolletage with some shimmery body bronzer for that all - over golden goddess look finally , i applied the @entity118 in @entity119			1
this is a sheer lipstick with just the right amount of pigmentation – it ’s a peachy nude colour with shimmery golden undertones that complemented the gold on my eyes perfectly			1
you do n’t have to stop at the face – you can accentuate your shoulders and décolletage with some shimmery body bronzer for that all - over golden goddess look			0
apply too faced ’s @entity130 to your arms and chest , and finish off with a dusting of powder bronzer on your @entity135 there you have it , a golden goddess look guaranteed to get you a @entity137 !			0

@entity0 says do n't be *afraid* to experiment and even try a gold lip
