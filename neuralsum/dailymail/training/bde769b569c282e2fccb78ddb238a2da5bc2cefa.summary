the islamic state terrorist known as @entity2 has been tracked by drones flying over the @entity5 city of @entity6 – but @entity9 @entity8 chiefs fear a ‘ kill or capture ’ mission there would end in bloody failure , sources disclosed last night			1
reaper drones deployed high above the terrorists ’ strongholds are also believed to have identified hostages wearing orange jumpsuits but top brass are thought to have currently ruled out a rescue operation because @entity1 defences are too strong			1
@entity8 bosses have advised the @entity22 that a sustained bombing campaign lasting several weeks would be preferable			0
above , file image of reaper drone a source said : ‘ the imagery from the drones and satellites is instructive but is infrastructure in @entity6 would have to be targeted over a sustained period to make any sort of raid a realistic possibility			1
‘ on the basis of our current advice there is very little chance of the prime minister signing off a rescue bid			2
the prospect of success has got to be 100 per cent or thereabouts , and at the moment it is nowhere near that			0
and for now there are not many other options on the table			0
' while sightings of @entity2 are useful , as was establishing his identity , we are still a long way off getting a hit on him			2
right now a raid would be suicidal			0
’ drones expert @entity61 , editor of @entity63 ’s @entity62 , confirmed that a @entity64 could pick out hostages ’ jumpsuits ‘ providing it knew where to look and its line of sight was not obscured ’			1
no mercy : @entity2 with @entity9 hostage @entity71 , whom he later beheaded he added that if terrorists looked directly into the sky they could be identified			1
the @entity77 has more than 100 @entity64 drones at its disposal , though how many have been sent to @entity5 is unknown			2
the drone has a maximum range of 5,300 miles and can fly for up to 32 hours at 207mph			0
its image sensors are inside its nose cone and a ‘ @entity85 ’ wide area surveillance system , used in missions over @entity88 , can also be fitted .			0
