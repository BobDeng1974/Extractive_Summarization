by @entity0 published : 06:55 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 05:27 est , 19 february 2013 a mother who was told she had miscarried and would never have any more children has spoken of her joy after doctors later realised she was actually pregnant with twins			1
@entity7 , 24 , had already suffered four miscarriages and two ectopic pregnancies – where the baby forms outside the womb and which can prove fatal to the mother			1
she found out she was pregnant again on january 3 – just two days after her partner @entity13 had proposed to her			2
after four miscarriages and two ectopic pregnancies - and being told she would never have more children - @entity7 has discovered she is pregnant with twins but her joy turned to more heartache when medical staff could not find the baby during a scan			1
they feared @entity21 , who has a two - year - old son , was having another ectopic pregnancy			1
as a result , she underwent surgery to remove her remaining fallopian tube - ending any hopes of having any more children			2
but just two days later , while still recovering in hospital and reeling from the horrendous news , she was told by doctors that blood tests taken after the operation showed she still had high levels of pregnancy hormones			1
' i had a scan a day later and i was very nervous , but they found a baby in my womb , ' she said			2
' in the space of a week i ’d gone from finding out i was pregnant , to losing the baby , and then finding out the baby had survived the operation			2
i could n’t believe it			0
' a week later , during a follow - up scan , miss @entity7 and partner @entity46 , of @entity47 , @entity48 , received an even bigger surprise - she was pregnant with twins			1
' we felt a sigh of relief when the nurse showed us the baby ’s heartbeat on the monitor , ' said miss @entity7			1
' but we could hardly believe it when she said " and there ’s the other one ’s "			0
miss @entity7 's pregnancy is particularly rare as the twins are ‘ monochorionic monoamniotic ’ which means they will grow in the same amniotic sac , with no membrane separating them			1
' we were really , really shocked but over the moon			0
it was like getting two for the price of one			0
' miss @entity7 's pregnancy is particularly rare as the twins are ‘ monochorionic monoamniotic ’ which means they will grow in the same amniotic sac , with no membrane separating them			1
they share the same placenta but have two umbilical cords , and will be identical			0
to take each day as it comes , and i think that ’s the best piece of advice			0
' the twins are to be delivered by caesarean section at 32 weeks			0
miss @entity7 also has a two - year - old son , @entity83			1
she said : ' he goes around telling people that mummy has two babies in her tummy , so i think he understands			0
' we have told @entity83 that he has a big job as an older brother to make sure the twins will be okay while they are growing up			1
' we still have to go for fortnightly check - ups to make sure the babies are okay but my mum told me to take each day as it comes , and i think that ’s the best piece of advice			2
' @entity99 - amniotic twins are identical twins that develop inside the same amniotic sac			1
also known as @entity98 ( @entity98 ) , they are always identical			0
@entity98 means one placenta , while monoamniotic means one sac			0
these pregnancies are incredibly rare , affecting an estimated one in 65,000 pregnancies			0
unfortunately , these twins have a greater risk of health complications due to the close proximity of the two umbilical cords in the amniotic sac			2
this makes it particularly easy for the twins to become entangled in each other 's cords , or to compress one another 's cords , endangering their oxygen and food supply			0
the survival rate for mono - amniotic twins is approximately 50 per cent			2
@entity126 twins are usually delivered by @entity127 at 32 weeks .			0

@entity7 , 24 , had *previously* had four miscarriages
doctors feared this time she was having ectopic pregnancy - where baby forms outside the womb - and performed surgery which made her *sterile*
told two days later she was actually pregnant - with twins
but pregnancy still risky , as twins are growing in the same sac
