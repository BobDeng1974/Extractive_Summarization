the gang were caught after police studied @entity144			0
@entity9 and @entity8 both blamed each other during police interview whilst @entity7 gave no comment to every question			1
police believe without the intervention of the cyclist @entity11 would have died			2
he was due to give evidence from behind a screen so he did n’t have to make eye contact with his attackers from the witness box but was spared the ordeal of reliving the assault after the gang pleaded guilty			0
describing @entity11 ’s ordeal , @entity214 prosecuting said : ' the thrill of moving away from home , becoming independent for the first time has been tainted by this attack			2
he fears the memory of those events may never leave him			0

' in a statement the victim ’s father @entity222 said : ' @entity11 is a harmless , well educated , articulate and kind young man and has been able to return to his studies			1
' given his strength of character and determination we have no doubts he will fulfill his potential and go on to have a happy and successful life in whatever field he chooses to work in			0
' the future prospects for his attackers are obviously less certain and less positive as they begin the lengthy custodial sentences which they have been given , and which they richly deserved given the vicious , senseless and sustained attack on our son			0
' we are eternally grateful for the fact that not only did @entity11 survive his ordeal , but that the police force were able to find the culprits quickly and remove them from the streets , thereby ensuring they were unable to inflict such pain and suffering on other decent members of society			0
' det insp @entity253 from @entity254 : ' i ca n’t begin to imagine how @entity11 must have felt on that night , as these three callous individuals dragged him to a secluded area of the park , subjected him to this horrific assault , robbed him and then threw him down a culvert with no second thought as to what would happen to him			1
' if @entity11 had n’t been found early that morning , it is highly unlikely he would have survived this cowardly , vicious and unnecessary attack			2

@entity6 , 21 , and 26 - year old @entity7 , both of @entity20 , @entity15 , approached @entity11 , 19 , and asked him for a cigarette
