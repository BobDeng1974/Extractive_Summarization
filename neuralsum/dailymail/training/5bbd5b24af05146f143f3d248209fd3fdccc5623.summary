for most people , dangling over the edge of the tallest man - made structure in the @entity3 is a terrifying prospect			1
but this is what several daring workers were doing today as they took stain samples from the ' stainless ' steel surface of the @entity11 in @entity12			1
the first stage of the sampling , costing $ 340,000 in total , saw men rappel down the 630ft monument 's west face for the first time in its 49 - year history			1
they removed rust - colored stains from its surface , before sending them to the @entity25 for testing in a bid to figure out what is causing them			1
above , the man was dangling near the top of the @entity11 , which is the tallest man - made structure in the @entity3 in the past , officials have struggled to find the source of the mysterious stains , with engineers across the @entity3 agreeing the @entity11 should be cleaned soon			1
this has been deemed particularly important as the iconic @entity50 monument has not been cleaned since it was first topped off in 1965			0

however , the work has not always been plain sailing - construction companies have been forced to delay the project several times due to weather			1
