airing her views on @entity19 yesterday , the self - styled ' social commentator ' claimed being a full - time mother was ' merely a biological status ' , and certainly not a ' job '			1
the controversial mouthpiece had already hit out at various ' types ' of mother in her @entity27 blog earlier this week			1
the mother - of - three branded parents who home - school their children as ' certifiable ' , before venting her spleen on women she labels ' fat mum ' , advising readers to ' stare opened mouthed at her sheer size wearing only @entity38 and a sneer '			1
but , clearly unfulfilled by her first rant , the 38 - year - old decided upon a follow - up , taking to @entity19 to mock mothers who chose not to work in favour of bringing up their children at home			1
she began her tirade with a statement mocking women who blame gender discrimination in the workplace as reasons for not working , saying : ' misogyny is just a more concise way of saying business is too tough for me			2
' she followed this an hour later with the tweet : ' full - time mummy is not an occupation			0
it is merely a biological status			0
' @entity2 made her latest controversial statements on her @entity19 account , claiming that being a full - time mother is not an occupation this is not @entity2 ' first attack on mothers or on parenting in general , previously causing public outrage with such statements as ' behind every fat child is a fat mum who should take responsibility ! ' , ' school mums are b * * * * * * because their lives are boring ' , ' working mothers who are n't a size eight like me are just lazy ' , as well as claiming babies with ginger hair are ' harder to love '			2
she famously aired her strong views on the ' correct ' way to parent , during an extremely heated debate with @entity87 on @entity89 's @entity88 , in which she slammed the ' attachment parenting ' method @entity87 uses with her two sons			2
it was widely considered that @entity87 emerged from the argument victorious			0
@entity2 gained some support from her @entity19 followers for her opinion on stay - at - home mothers , but will likely anger thousands her latest statements have garnered a mixed response from her 114,253 twitter followers , who oscillated between berating her for being on @entity19 so much , and strong agreement with her statement			0
@entity2 ' most recent tirade was against the housemates of celebrity @entity107 , upon whom she opened in an unprompted barrage of insults , saying that @entity110 was a ' boring old woman ' who ' probably smells a little bit of wee ' , while suggesting former @entity113 star @entity113 would be ' perfectâ € ™ ' in a porn film .			0
