by @entity0 published : 07:20 est , 29 july 2012 updated : 08:26 est , 29 july 2012 one of president @entity3 's top security officials has briefed @entity5 's prime minister on @entity7 plans for a possible attack on @entity9 , it was claimed today			1
national security adviser @entity10 sought to reassure @entity5 that @entity11 is prepared to act militarily should diplomacy and sanctions fail to pressure @entity9 to abandon its nuclear enrichment programme			1
he met premier @entity15 during a visit to the country earlier this month , according to the @entity5 daily newspaper @entity18			2
threat : @entity9 's @entity21 test missiles in the desert an @entity5 government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment and a @entity7 @entity28 spokesman could not be reached			1
@entity9 leader : @entity9 's president @entity30 both @entity5 and @entity7 think @entity9 's programme under the leadership of president @entity30 , is aimed at developing bombs , and not for peaceful purposes as @entity35 claims			1
@entity9 has threatened to shut down the @entity36 , which is used by 40 per cent of the world 's oil tankers , in revenge for sanctions imposed on the country			0
but the @entity7 has insisted that it will not allow @entity9 to choke off one of the world 's busiest shipping routes and an @entity7 military official said that ' any disruption will not be tolerated			1
' a @entity47 spokesman warned that @entity9 would destroy its own ' economic lifeline ' if it disrupted the international oil trade			0
tensions rose after @entity9 ’s top naval commander bragged that shutting down the @entity52 would be ‘ easier than drinking a glass of water			0
’ and they continued to escalate with @entity9 revealing one of its surveillance planes has recorded video and photographed a @entity7 aircraft carrier near an area where it was carrying out military maneuvers			2
if @entity9 were successfully to block access to the @entity36 , the price of crude oil would almost certainly rise dramatically			0
following a mistaken report last year that the strait had already been closed , the oil price jumped by $ 2 , to over $ 100 a barrel			0
a senior @entity71 official has insisted in the past that @entity52 nations would be able to make up for any shortfall caused by the sanctions , but this would be of little use if @entity9 succeeded in cutting off the strait .			0
