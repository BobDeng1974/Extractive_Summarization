while the world is divided over whether ' that dress ' is blue and black , or white and gold , @entity0 has been involved in a colour controversy of its own			1
this time the debate involves @entity6 – the so - called ' red planet ' – which conspiracy theorists believe is in fact more blue and green			1
they argue the space agency has manipulated the colour of images from @entity6 to appear red , orange and pink , in what they claim is an attempt to mask life on the planet			2
on the left is a processed image of what @entity0 believes @entity6 to look like the sky on @entity37 is blue because of a phenomenon known as ' @entity39 ' , in which blue particles of light are scattered around by the atmosphere			1
on @entity6 , the reverse effect takes place			0
the dust in the atmosphere scatters the red particles of light , makes the sky appear red			0
@entity0 claims the sky appeared blue because @entity25 's filtered images still had to be calibrated with the right colour balance			1
the debate has raged since the 1970s when @entity0 's @entity25 lander became the first spacecraft to touch down on the red planet , according to a report by @entity57 in @entity58			1
its initial images revealed what appeared to be a blue sky , similar to that seen on @entity37 , raising hopes that there may be @entity6 life			2
@entity25 team member @entity66 announced at a press conference soon after : ' despite the impression on these images , the sky is not blue ... the sky is in fact pink			2
' the sky on @entity37 is blue because of a phenomenon known as ' @entity39 ' , in which blue particles of light are scattered around by the atmosphere			0
on @entity6 , the reverse effect takes place			0
the dust in the atmosphere scatters the red particles of light , makes the sky also appear red			0
@entity0 claims the sky appeared blue in the first @entity6 images because @entity25 's filtered photographs still had to be calibrated with the right colour balance			1
@entity0 sometimes uses different filters to depict @entity6			1
the left image shows @entity6 as seen by the @entity91 in july , 2001			2
centre is @entity6 as seens by the @entity91 in march , 1997			0
on the right is the red planet as seen by the @entity96 in february , 2006 the left version is the raw , unprocessed view as it is received directly from @entity6			0
the centre is a guess of the ' natural ' colour that humans would see if they visited @entity6			0
the right version shows the result of white - balancing , which interprets the scene as if it were viewed under earthlike lighting conditions but not everyone is convinced			0
@entity110 , a researcher at @entity111 stated in areport : ' an excess of red is found on all of the @entity6 blue and green panels			1
' such extreme illuminations are shown to be incompatible with the grey panels			0
' it appears that the true raw image data have been modified prior to publication to convert the blue and green pixels to grey , rendering a grossly changed image			0
' conspiracy theorists have made wilder claims , with one writing : ' the images were falsely reddened to make it appear there was no life , no green algae or lichen on the plane			2
' today both the opportunity and curiosity rover have patches of colour attached to their instruments that are used in to adjust the reflected colour to a true likeness			0
is this what @entity6 really looks like ? a mosaic from @entity0 's @entity146 rover shows @entity147 in raw colour			1
@entity0 says raw colour is similar to the way the scene would look ' in a typical smart - phone camera photo ' pictured is the same scene after it has been given a white - balanced colour adjustment that turns the sky blue			2
@entity0 sometimes does this to simulate @entity37 - like lighting , making it easier to analyse the geology as a result , pictures of @entity6 are usually altered to provide a red and pink tinge caused by the iron - heavy dust that fills the atmosphere			2
but even @entity0 admits this is n't an exact science			1
colour balance is a highly subjective and no two spacecraft use the same exact filters			1
as well as this , people often perceive colours differently – as shown by the famous black and blue dress			0
to clear up the debate , @entity0 usually releases a number of different types of @entity6 imagery , which include the raw file , unprocessed colour pictures and true - colour versions			1
to add to the confusion , the @entity181 recently found that the interior of @entity184 ' is in fact blue / grey			0
to add to the confusion , the @entity181 recently found that the interior of @entity6 ' rock ' @entity190 ' is in fact blue / grey colour balance is a highly subjective and no two spacecraft use the same exact @entity193 well as this , people often perceive colours differently – as shown by the famous black and blue dress			1

in 1976 @entity0 's @entity25 sent back an image of @entity6 with blue skies
@entity0 claimed image had yet to be calibrated with right colour balance
some conspiracy theorists have *questioned* @entity0 's calibration *methods*
@entity0 admits it is n't an exact science and often uses different versions
