by @entity0 when @entity2 northern hit @entity3 in april , it did so with a devastating force of 105 miles per hour ( 170km/h )			1
while large parts of infrastructure inland were able to weather the storm , areas of the delicate @entity6 were n’t so lucky			1
now scientists have revealed the extent of the devastation using specially developed underwater imaging techniques that reveal before and after shot os the area in unprecedented detail			0

a section of the @entity6 is shown on the left @entity25			0
the right image shows the dead coral following the storm which hit the region in april to create the amazing underwater images , @entity31 and the @entity33 survey developed the first ever tablet - operated underwater cameras			1
complete with their own propulsion system , the images are captured through a spherical camera housing that allows continuous high - resolution , 360 - degree imagery to be collected as divers steer through the reefs			0
on a typical run it will capture over 1000 panoramas , which are then stitched together to produce a virtual dive experience			0
in the aftermath of @entity2 , the @entity47 sent a team of divers into the @entity6 to see how badly the storm had impacted the area			1
the team had previously surveyed the area in 2012 , in collaboration with @entity31 , to create an underwater ‘ street view ’ of the region			0
equipped with the first ever tablet - operated underwater camera , dubbed @entity59 , divers were able to see the dead corals , damaged reefs and destroyed sea life left in the wake of the storm			2
@entity2 was the second major storm in three years to hit the @entity6 and @entity66 off the @entity68 @entity19 coast			1

the cyclone was the second major storm in three years to hit the @entity6 and @entity66 off the @entity68 @entity19 coast the same area shown in the previous image is pictured here @entity76			1
despite their devastating power , up until now , the impact cyclones have on coral reefs was unpredictable and relatively unknown despite their devastating power , up until now , the impact cyclones have on coral reefs was unpredictable and relatively unknown			0
the team found that the @entity84 region of the @entity6 suffered most as @entity2 passed directly overhead			1
however , there was less impact at @entity87 in the @entity66 because the centre of the storm passed about 56 miles ( 90km ) away			1

the @entity100 cameras are pictured here , piloted by the @entity102 's @entity101 as he surveys the damage to the area the most striking observation was the huge variance of storm impact and no uniform pattern of damage in the path of the storm			2
on @entity87 it was evident that some areas are more robust , with some parts naturally protected from storms			2
while the outer walls of the reef lying closer to the path of the cyclone were damaged , these corals are relatively hardy and are expected to recover , the scientists said			1

there was less impact at @entity87 in the @entity66 because the centre of the storm passed about 56 miles ( 90 kilometres ) away the @entity6 thriving prior to the storm			1
on @entity87 it was evident that some areas are more robust , with some parts naturally protected from storms while outer walls of the reef lying closer to the path of the cyclone were damaged , these corals are relatively hardy and can be expected to recover , the scientists said acting as a breakwater , the reefs themselves seem to have reduced the power of the storm ’s impact and , as a result , @entity2 left those areas mostly intact			1
but there were more pockets of intense damage found in the shallower @entity158 on the @entity6 closer to the coastline			0
‘ we found areas with extensive damage next to perfectly healthy reefs that appeared virtually unaffected by the storm ’ said @entity160 , one of the divers and director of the @entity163			0
‘ there were differences not just between the sheltered and exposed parts of reefs , but also differing levels of damage to areas immediately adjacent to one another ’			0
when @entity2 northern @entity3 in @entity19 in april , it did so with a devastating force of 105 miles per hour ( 170km/h )			1
pictured is a satellite image showing @entity180 as it passed over the @entity6 earlier this year the team now want to find out how the overall structures of the reefs may have channelled the force of the waves , creating the varied pattern of damage			2
‘ there is a myriad of increasing and cumulative impacts on the @entity6 , ’ said professor @entity188 , the @entity47 chief scientist			0
‘ we can control impacts such as fishing , coastal development and marine debris			0
however , we do not have the same control over storms and cyclones			0
‘ ensuring that coral can bounce back from these disturbances is at the heart of the matter			2
the more we reduce other stressors on the reef , the better the chance that coral can bounce back			2
‘ given the steep decline of coral on the reef , it ’s clear we have a lot of work to do			0
’ the @entity84 region of the @entity6 ( pictured ) suffered most from the impact of tropical storm @entity2			1
@entity87 ( pictured ) in the @entity66 was less damaged , according to photographic evidence provided by the project divers a green turtle surveys the damaged reef			1

tropical storm @entity2 hit @entity3 , @entity19 in april with winds reaching 105 miles per hour ( 170km/h )
images show parts of the @entity6 before the storm hit , and the same areas after they felt @entity2 's force
underwater cameras shows @entity84 region of the @entity6 suffered most as @entity2 passed
there was less impact at @entity87 in @entity66 because the centre of the storm passed 56 miles ( 90km ) away
@entity246 walls of reef lying closer to the path of the cyclone were damaged , but scientists claim they will bounce back
