by @entity1 reporter published : 21:25 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 09:33 est , 13 september 2013 @entity2 , the adult film actress who recently contracted @entity4 , is calling for more porn producers to encourage the use of safe sex on set			1
the 29 - year - old actress says she was naive to trust industry std tests and said other performers told her not to ask for condoms			1
' i learned that there 's always someone younger and sexier , willing to do something you 're not , ' @entity13 told the @entity19			2
' i think we need more choices because of that			2
condoms should be a choice			1
' test results : adult film actress @entity2 has contracted @entity4 @entity13 performed in her first porn scene a few months ago but , after just nine more scenes , she tested positive for @entity4			1
the actress does not know when or from whom she contacted the disease , but admitted that none of the male performers she worked with used condoms			1
@entity13 said another actress told her : ' do n't even bring it up because they have somebody waiting to replace you			2
' in november , a @entity40 district passed a measure on condom use in the billion - dollar industry , despite a campaign against it by porn executives			1
' people do nâ€™t want to see adult films where people are wearing condoms , ' @entity48 publisher @entity47 had argued , according to @entity53			1
@entity13 , who also had to be treated in hospital after contracting a kidney infection after one film , said all but one of her scenes were filmed in @entity40 , and one was filmed in @entity60			2
the @entity60 one , which involved bondage and anal sex , was the only set to have offered her the option of a condom , but @entity13 said she did n't feel she needed one because her male co-star had a negative @entity67 test			2
' i was new to the industry			0
when i was told that i was safe to shoot , i was like , " ok , cool " , ' she said			0
' i had no idea			0
i really did n't understand			0
' diagnosis : @entity2 has tested positive for @entity4 just months after filming her first porn scene naive : 29 - year - old @entity13 says she did n't ask for condoms because all porn actors have regular @entity67 tests affected : @entity77 , @entity2 's partner , has also tested positive for @entity4 film company @entity78 , which was behind the @entity60 production , confirmed that @entity13 had been offered a condom but had declined to use it			1
since contracting @entity82 has discovered that her health insurance will not cover her treatment			1
while injuries , such as the damage caused to one of @entity13 's breasts during a shoot , are covered by workers ' compensation , because it is impossible to know which set she contracted @entity4 on , she has to cover her medical bills alone			0
' i spent more in one day on medical stuff than i did on rent for two months , ' she told the @entity19			0
' i had a safety net of three months of not working and that cut into it a lot			0
' currently it is costing @entity2 $ 2,000 a month for pills to curb the disease			1
the actress has set up a @entity106 fund to help her meet her medical bills and plans to do online solo performances			0
after her @entity4 diagnosis , a six - day moratorium was put in place to prevent further cases being spread			2
however , a week after the moratorium was lifted , two more porn actors , including @entity13 's boyfriend @entity114 , tested positive for @entity4			0
funds : @entity13 has set up a web page to help raise money to pay for her treatment spirited response : @entity2 has vowed to fight against the disease @entity13 believes the moratorium should have been in place for longer , and has been trying to raise awareness of the importance of safe sex on set			1
on her @entity128 account she has vowed to fight the disease , saying : ' if i could beat my own deamons as a teen i can definitely beat this disease '			0
she added that had she been properly informed she would have demanded a condom each time she worked , adding : ' at the end of the day , it 's about your safety			0
and a piece of paper that says you 're clear to shoot does n't mean anything			0

@entity2 says she wishes she had pushed for condoms
29 - year - old is struggling to raise money for life - *saving* treatment
