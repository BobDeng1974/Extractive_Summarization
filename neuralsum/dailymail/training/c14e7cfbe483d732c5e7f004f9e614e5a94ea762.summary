multi-millionaire @entity0 is putting up hundreds of migrants in his chain of 47 hotels this is the multi-millionaire cashing in on a @entity6 decision to use one of the country ’s largest privately owned hotel chains to house asylum seekers			1
in a deal costing the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds a week , @entity0 is putting up hundreds of migrants in his chain of 47 hotels			1
his firm , @entity14 , owns the three properties in @entity16 and @entity17 that were recently found to be providing ‘ full board ’ accommodation for hundreds of taxpayer - funded asylum seekers			1
now the @entity21 has learned that another of 76 - year - old mr @entity0 ’s hotels – four miles from @entity24 – is housing 100 asylum seekers			1
many are from @entity27 and @entity28 with others from @entity31 states or @entity32			0
paying guests – who were using the 130 - bedroom @entity34 near the @entity37 village of @entity38 as a ‘ stay and fly ’ hotel – were stunned to find the group staying for free alongside them			1
one guest , who was paying £ 50 for a pre-flight stay and then £ 6 a day to park her car in the hotel grounds , said : ‘ it is more like a hostel than a hotel – i will never stay here again after this experience			1
’ as she spoke more than 70 asylum seekers sat on chairs and on the floor in the reception area and lounge – while others went for walks in the sprawling grounds			1
@entity27 - born @entity59 said he had been in @entity60 for only a few weeks and was moved to the hotel from another @entity63 property – thought to be in @entity17			2
‘ i am grateful to the @entity6 for paying for my room , ’ he said			0
‘ we get fed at the hotel and it is good to be here but the rooms are not so big			2
some people have to share			0
’ while the arrangement has clearly come as a surprise to paying guests , it appears to be providing a lucrative income for mr @entity0 , the founder , owner and chief executive of @entity63			0
he is said to have amassed a personal fortune of £ 70million and lives in a ten - bedroomed former hotel worth more than £ 3million in a leafy @entity81 village close to his headquarters			1
it is near a property once owned by former @entity87 footballer @entity86			0
mr @entity0 ’s home is surrounded by carefully - kept gardens featuring marble statues			0
his two @entity92 cars and a @entity93 sit on the driveway			0
enjoying a country walk : asylum seekers pictured at the @entity34 , near @entity24 he also has a £ 400,000 leasehold flat in @entity99 , @entity100			1
business is booming for @entity63 despite the fact that some of the group ’s hotels have been described as dirty on the @entity107 website , where guests post comments about hotels where they have stayed			0
his hotel group ’s latest figures showed an increased turnover of 25 per cent to almost £ 70million – with profits of nearly £ 12million posted last year			1

it admitted breaching safety regulations during conversion work in 2010			0
the @entity6 is thought to be paying around £ 350 per week for each asylum seeker placed in @entity63 ’s hotels			2
mr @entity0 's business is booming despite the fact that some of his group ’s hotels have been described as dirty on the @entity107 website mr @entity0 has expanded the budget hotel chain			2
it now has 47 hotels offering 9,000 rooms , and three years ago he bought the @entity136 holiday camp business			0
in 2011/2012 the @entity6 spent £ 150million providing accommodation for asylum seekers			1
the figure is now likely to nudge £ 200million			0
judging by reviews posted on @entity107 , @entity63 is not advertising to paying guests that it houses asylum seekers at the @entity34 , near @entity24			1
one reviewer wrote : ‘ we did not expect that the hotel would be full of people who are on a very extended stay and get all of their meals and £ 10 a day spending money as well ! ’ the @entity150 , which has views of the @entity152 of @entity16 , is housing newly arrived asylum claimants the @entity154 , in @entity17 , where 67 asylum seekers are currently being put up at the taxpayer 's expense many residents in the village of @entity38 are equally unimpressed with their new neighbours			1
one woman , who lives yards from the hotel , said : ‘ last weekend we had a large number of men sitting on the verge outside our house and staring at us and our home			0
it really was quite intimidating			0
’ last month the @entity21 told how the @entity6 bussed coachloads of asylum seekers to the three - star @entity172 in @entity17 where 88 were billeted			2
it then emerged that a further 67 were booked into the @entity63 - owned @entity154 , which is also in @entity17 , while 130 were at the @entity150 in @entity16			0
earlier in the month hotel inspectors found 600 asylum seekers crammed into the 98 - room @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity178 , with nine people sharing one room			1
it is not owned by @entity63 , but many of the asylum seekers were later moved to @entity17 and @entity16			2
it is unclear how many more of @entity63 ’s 47 hotels are being used for asylum seekers			2
last night neither @entity14 nor mr @entity0 was available for comment			0
the @entity6 refused to confirm details of its contract with the company			0
