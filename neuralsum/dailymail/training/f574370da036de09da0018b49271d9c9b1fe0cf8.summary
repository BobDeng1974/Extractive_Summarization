axed : columnist @entity0 was canned from @entity1 for promoting gun controls in his december column the editor of @entity1 apologized to readers and resigned shortly after the writer of a column advocating gun control was fired this week			1
@entity0 , a well - known television host and gun writer , was canned after penning a column in favour of gun control in the magazine ’s december issue			1
the outrage then prompted editor @entity16 to issue an apology and resign			1
in the apology , mr @entity16 said he hoped the column ‘ would generate a healthy exchange of ideas on gun rights , ’ but then said he was wrong and asked for forgiveness			1
mr @entity24 , widely visible in the gun community , has written about guns and hosted gun - oriented television shows for decades , but that did not save him from reader backlash			1
especially , as the @entity31 noted , when the @entity32 posted the column to its site saying ; the editor ( sic ) of @entity1 makes an argument for gun regulation			2
’ ‘ i firmly believe that all @entity39 citizens have a right to keep and bear arms , ’ mr @entity0 wrote , ‘ but i do not believe they have a right to use them irresponsibly			0
’ the offending column did not say that people should be barred from owning guns			0
it argued that gun owners should be required to pass a certification similar to owning a car			0
not just a columnist : mr @entity0 also hosted several television programs produced by the magazine 's parent company ‘ [ @entity56 has ] an equal right to enact regulatory laws requiring them to undergo adequate training and preparation for the responsibility of bearing arms , ’ mr @entity0 continued			1
mr @entity0 then cites the example set this month by @entity64 , which recently enacted a concealed carry weapons regulation that allows for the issuance of a permit after 16 hours of training are completed , which he argued hardly constitutes infringement			0
reader backlash was fierce , and action was swift			0
writing that he owes every reader an apology , mr @entity16 said the magazine ’s ‘ commitment to the @entity75 is unwavering			2
’ the former editor said mr @entity0 had been let go and that he made a mistake publishing the column , which he thought would spur healthy debate			2
lock shot : mr @entity0 's aim is usually dead center , but his last column missed the mark with readers calling the decision a ‘ miscalculation , ’ mr @entity16 also announced that plans in place for a new editor to assume control of the magazine in january would be implemented immediately			1
the pro-gun control column has been removed from the magazine ’s site , but is archived on various other webpages			0
comments to the apology were mostly negative , with many people saying they had cancelled their subscriptions			0
some defended publishing the column , but were shouted down by several antagonistic comments .			0
