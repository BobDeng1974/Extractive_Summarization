they were built to slash a college 's carbon emissions and save them tens of thousands of pounds in energy bills			1
but some people must have been left wondering if the new ' solar meadow ' will live up to its billing as it opened today under grey and rainy skies			1
the site at the @entity12 campus of @entity13 in @entity14 is @entity16 's first solar meadow and one of the most northerly locations for the green technology in @entity20			1
staff and the local @entity24 stroll around the site under the cloudy skies and hold umbrellas to ward off the rain the 2,500 solar panels are expected to cut the college 's carbon emissions by 300,000kg a year the five - acre site cost £ 1.2million to build and was designed by @entity31			1
it promises to decrease the college 's carbon emissions by 300,000kg a year and meet all the campus ' electricity demands			0
but dignitaries who turned out for the grand opening had to walk through the rain with not a beam of sunlight in sight			0
dressed in bright hi - viz jackets , the group including local @entity24 @entity43 , staff , students and business leaders , were pictured holding umbrellas aloft as they inspected the site			2
backers of the project also hope it will become a local attraction			0
wildflowers and various grasses are to be planted in the meadow to increase the site 's biodiversity			2
professor @entity59 , vice-principal of @entity13 , who is leading the project , said : ' we believe the solar meadow also looks great and will become a significant attraction for local people as well as visitors to the capital			1
' it is also fantastic that the project has enabled the college to engage with schools and local community groups to develop their own renewable energy projects			0
' it really is giving something back to the local community in more ways than one			0
' student @entity79 walks through the site that backers hope will become a local attraction the solar meadow , which can still generate energy under in overcast conditions , will also be used as a teaching facility for students			1
the creation of solar farms around the world has used so much fossil fuel that they will not contribute any ' real ' energy until 2020 , a study found			2
the @entity96 research found the panels have only just begun to surpass the amount of energy ploughed into creating the installations			2
the energy used to produce solar panels is intense			1
the initial step in producing the silicon at the heart of most panels is to melt silica rock at 3,000 degrees fahrenheit using electricity , commonly from coal - fired power plants			0
there is also an energy cost in shipping and installing the panels			0
however , because of technological advances , the solar power industry is poised to pay off its debt of energy as early as 2015 and no later than 2020			0
it will act as an outdoor classroom for engineering students as the performance of the panels and environmental conditions are monitored			0
' [ the solar meadow ] will help not only to provide the next generation of engineers with essential skills , but also allow the college to become less reliant on fossil fuel energy , ' said prof @entity59			1
the meadow will also be used as a research centre where the interaction between biodiversity and solar technology is analysed , including the effect of environmental conditions on the output from the solar panels such as weather and pollen			1
a research assistant from @entity141 will join the team of staff and students from @entity13 to collect and analyse the data			2
the students are also excited with the development of the meadow			0
@entity148 , 23 , from @entity149 , is studying @entity150 , said : ' i 'm really interested in renewable energy and i 'm excited that @entity13 is leading the way with the solar meadow			1
' i 'm really looking forward to using the solar meadow as part of my course			2
' i think it will further my interests within solar energy technologies and modern engineering in @entity16			0
' @entity162 , @entity31 's head of green deal and energy solutions , said : ' the solar meadow will not only generate around 560,000 @entity166 every year , enough energy to power 170 homes , but is also a fine example of how industry and education can work well together			1
' this project will bring benefits to the college , its students and the wider community as well as further strengthening @entity16 's renewable energy resources			0
' @entity150 student @entity178 sits in the rain as @entity16 's first ever solar meadow opens			1

the site in @entity14 contains 2,500 solar panels built for £ 1.2million
solar meadow is one of most northerly sites to use the green technology
@entity13 is expected to save tens of thousands in energy bills
