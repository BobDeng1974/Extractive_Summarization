two top £ 11,000 - a - year independent schools have sparked outrage among parents by organising a @entity5 trip to west africa – just 400 miles from the deadly ebola zone where even doctors have decided it is too dangerous to visit			1
teachers are facing a backlash from parents after arranging the trip to @entity13 for 25 pupils from @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity18 , in @entity19 , @entity17			1
parents are now urging the school to ' see sense ' and cancel the week - long excursion , which costs £ 700 per pupil , branding it ' unnecessary ' and ' very dangerous '			1
@entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 are the worst affected areas to be hit with @entity34 , where the death toll has reached almost 7,000			1
in total , more than 16,000 have been affected in the three countries alone since the worst outbreak of the deadly virus on record began 12 months ago			1
with 500 new cases reported in west africa each week , parents have expressed concern about sending schoolchildren to an area where they could become infected			1
dr @entity30 , a leading surgeon whose daughter was due to go on the field trip , has urged the 1,400 pupil school to cancel the trip after he and an international group of leading medics postponed a humanitarian medical mission to nearby @entity32 because of the epidemic			1
the 58 - year - old and his wife @entity75 , 45 , are also vowing to keep their 17 - year - old daughter @entity77 away from school for the incubation period of 21 days if her classmates go on the trip			2
father - of - two dr @entity30 , who has alerted the @entity85 and the @entity86 of his concerns , said : ' there is no necessity or vital need for the trip			2
' in normal circumstances , yes , @entity13 is a good experience for them , but in abnormal circumstances why would you take the risk ? ' the whole of @entity28 is very dangerous and for the school to feel they are safe is naive			1
' even if they are safe they will be able to transmit diseases which could affect the community on their return			0
' this is not only about my daughter it 's about what will happen when they come back			0
they need to see sense			2
' the school trip to @entity13 has been planned to give an insight into the country			1

pictured : pupils during the 2010 trip dr @entity30 , based at @entity126 in @entity127 , has been a consultant surgeon for almost 20 years and is a member of @entity129 , a group which annually travels to deliver self - funded humanitarian surgery in poverty - stricken @entity132 nations			1
he and a team made up of @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity137 medical professionals were due to travel to @entity32 this month to perform free surgery on patients suffering with hernias in the country , but were forced to cancel the trip over @entity34 fears			1
the school field trip is the ninth biennial trip to @entity146 , which last year featured the opening of new school buildings , new wells and a village soap making business			2
dr @entity30 met teachers to discuss his concerns regarding @entity34 but was told staff had received advice from @entity156 saying it was safe to travel to @entity13			1
he added : ' in those countries there are no borders - nothing in the terms we understand here			0
' people just walk around			0
the decision was based on the presentation the school had and i was possibly the only one who opposed the idea and on a show of hands many who agreed with going were students			0
' it 's an irresponsible decision for something so trivial			0
they could go next year or go somewhere else			0
' they could go outside africa - money is not an issue , whether we get that back or not			0
our decision to postpone the aid trip was n't taken lightly			2
the @entity34 death toll currently stands at 6,928 , according to the @entity185 , with the total number of people infected having surpassed 16,000 in @entity28			1

the toddler , scientists believe was patient zero , suffered a fever , black stools and vomiting			0
march 25 , 2014 - the @entity51 authorities report the outbreak to the @entity185 after diagnosing the virus as @entity34			1
by this stage deaths from the virus was still confined to @entity51			1
may 2014 - it appeared as though the outbreak may be slowing , as the death toll tailed off			1
may 2014 - a very well - known woman from @entity51 , a traditional medical practitioner and leader of a secret society died from the virus , professor @entity211 said			2

dozens were infected and the disease spread across @entity51 's southern border to both neighbouring nations			1

august 8 , 2014 - the @entity185 declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern			0
' we already had our visas and 40 boxes of medication			0
my daughter is too upset about not going to understand the danger and to understand we are protecting her			0
' his wife @entity75 added that the school was ' gambling ' by continuing with the trip despite the deadly outbreak			0
she said : ' when @entity34 erupted we changed our minds on the trip because there are a lot of unreported cases in @entity132 countries			1
' we know they say there is no travelling between the three affected countries but that does n't interest me because a lot of @entity132 people walk across the border			0
' you ca n't guarantee it is n't there			0
the school said " if you do n't want your children to go , that 's fine , but the trip will go ahead "			0
' i tried to explain that the risk does n't stop there and there needs to be a 21 day incubation period			0
i 'm really not happy because what if any child catches the virus , how do you know ? ' even if they go and come back and nobody contracts the virus i will still be disappointed in them because they are gambling			0
they still took the risk			0
' @entity282 , whose daughter goes to nearby @entity284 , has also expressed fears for the community as pupils from fee - paying @entity18 are also due to go on the trip			1
she said : ' @entity284 get on the same bus as @entity18 ' , so everybody is concerned			2
' there 's just no sense for the school trip to carry on with the risk involved			2
if it is going ahead surely the children should be kept away for 21 days afterwards			0
' for the sake of a school trip it seems an absolute farce			0
either people are downright stupid or they 're happy gambling with safety			0
' there are 500 new cases of @entity34 ( above ) reported in west africa each week , according to the health agency parents fear there could be some unreported cases of @entity34 in @entity13 which could infect the pupils @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 are the worst hit countries in west africa , with more than 16,000 infected the disease is now spreading fastest in @entity53 , where there has been a severe surge in cases recently founded in 1855 , @entity15 charges more than £ 3,500 per term and boasts @entity319 political editor @entity318 and newsreader @entity320 among alumni			1

she said : ' @entity15 has a rigorous @entity327 procedure for every trip which takes place , taking into account the distinct circumstances of each visit			2
' we have followed guidance from @entity156 , the @entity335 , @entity336 for @entity337 and the @entity338 in carrying out the @entity327 for the forthcoming biennial trip to @entity13 , taking into consideration the specific concerns which some parents have regarding travel in west africa at the current time			1
' the official advice given indicates that the trip is safe to go ahead			0
' we have held a special meeting with parents to explain , share and discuss this advice , understanding their continuing apprehensions , and gave parents and students the choice as to whether they still wished to continue taking part			0
