it was the explosive storyline that threatened to derail life as we know it in the gentle village of @entity4			1
after a local gamekeeper is brutally murdered , one of the show 's best - loved characters @entity9 is wrongfully jailed for life for a crime he did n't commit			1
except , as fans of @entity14 's rural soap @entity4 know , it never happened			2
new storyline : @entity17 ( @entity18 , pictured with @entity19 who plays @entity20 ) had an affair and child with @entity23 in the show instead of the story running the @entity27 miscarriage of justice story the director of @entity31 @entity30 has revealed that she banned the programme makers from airing the dramatic plot twist because she felt it was too ' far fetched ' , leaving the show 's editor close to tears			1
as a result of her executive decision , made in 2002 when she was @entity14 controller , the show 's writers were forced to rewrite a huge swathe of the script			2
instead , they came up with @entity17 's affair and child with @entity23 , a storyline that played out over more than a year and boosted the programme 's audience figures			1
the @entity9 family of @entity4 : ( clockwise from top left ) @entity52 as @entity53 , @entity54 as @entity55 , @entity56 as @entity57 and @entity58 as @entity27 who would have been wrongly jailed @entity30 vetoed a storyline that would have seen lovable @entity27 wrongly jailed miss @entity30 , who earns £ 340,000 - a - year , said that the proposed plot would have seen @entity62 's ' deeply boring gamekeeper boyfriend ' @entity63 murdered , and @entity9 ' banged up for life a killing he did not commit '			1
she said it would have led to a ' long running rough justice story '			0
the village of @entity4 in the county of @entity70			0
its goings on have been followed nationally since 1951 explaining her decision to can it , she said : ' murders in country villages by people you have never met are unbelievably rare			0
and this felt so far fetched that i banned it			0
' to the great chagrin of the then editor , who nearly cried			0
@entity4 was appointed editor of the show in 1992 and stayed in the chair until her retirement in may 2013			1
she once commented : ' to be politically correct is really to be moral			0
it is having a correct moral stance			0
@entity91 is , in fact , my moral plank			0
' @entity4 many fans of the show disliked @entity4 and her changes to @entity4 - one columnist said that she ' not only turned it into politically correct drivel but totally deprived it of its humour '			1
@entity4 told the @entity31 : ' i do not mind proper criticism , and we have a very intelligent audience out there who love the programme , and i love debating with listeners			2
what i do n't like is cyber-bullying			0
' ' but as a consequence of my decision , she and her team came up with the brilliant and much more authentic @entity23 and @entity17 adultery story which gripped @entity115 for over a year			1
' eventually , @entity63 was killed off in a different way , when he committed suicide in a 2004 episode			1
miss @entity30 contrasted the @entity4 - which is billed as the ' everyday story of country folk ' - with more violent tv soaps such as @entity122			1
discussing the eventual confrontation between @entity17 and his wronged wife , she said : ' in @entity122 resolving this issue of love and loyalty would have involved a lot of shouting and possibly some violent crime			0
' in @entity4 , such things are decided over the washing up			0
' in recent years , @entity4 has been accused of introducing ever - more violent and dramatic plot lines - including bloody accidents and violent gangs - in a bid to increase ratings			2
last year , former @entity122 producer @entity138 took over the long - running show and promised to deliver ' @entity141 ' plots			2
violence is not new in @entity4 - in 1957 @entity143 ( @entity144 ) , the gamekeeper , shot @entity145 ( @entity146 ) , a poacher			2

£ 340,000 - a - year director of radio @entity30 *refused* to let story go *ahead*
2002 story would have had @entity27 wrongly jailed for murder of gamekeeper
instead show ran @entity17 's affair and child with @entity23
gamekeeper @entity63 written out by committing suicide in 2004
editor @entity4 ' nearly cried ' when told to drop the storyline
