by @entity0 @entity2 's fourth - round opponent @entity1 has been practising with his former coach @entity3 - but the @entity4 is confident @entity3 will not have spilled any secrets			1
reigning champion @entity2 , 27 , plays @entity6 on monday for a place in the quarter - finals			1
@entity1 has an @entity10 wife , @entity9 , and lives in @entity11			1
he met @entity3 by chance at the @entity14 tennis club in @entity15 and the pair spent time on court together			1
@entity3 was @entity2 's coach from the end of 2011 until march this year and helped him finally win a @entity19 - guiding him to the @entity21 title in 2012 , the @entity25 title last year and @entity23 gold			1
' that does n't surprise me in the slightest			2
' @entity2 lost four @entity19 finals before finally winning his first			1
@entity3 also lost four @entity19 finals before winning the first of eight he won in his career			1
he gave the @entity25 champion valuable insight into how to become a winner			0
@entity2 insists that @entity3 hitting with @entity1 wo n't have helped him			1
' you ca n't compare practising with @entity3 to playing against me , it 's completely different , ' he said			1
the journey towards a second straight @entity25 title takes @entity2 into the land of giants this week - literally and figuratively			1
he has breezed through his first three matches against low - ranked small fry with straight - sets wins taking a total of five hours			0
on monday he will see the gradient of the challenge rise steeply , facing 6ft 8in @entity1 , the world no 18			1
and if he clears that hurdle , @entity63 's dangerous world no 13 @entity60 will probably await in the quarter - final , followed by world no 2 @entity65 and world no 1 @entity68 after that			2
happy days : @entity2 has been able to take time out with actor @entity71 the contrast with last year is huge			1
as he sought to break the 77 - year @entity74 hoodoo , @entity2 did not face a single player from inside the top 20 before the final			2
and he knows that an easy first week this year carries a risk of complacency , although he insists he is ready for a stiffer challenge			2
' it could become a problem if you are not mentally prepared for the matches to get more challenging , ' he said yesterday			0
' if you just think everything will be the same as it was in the first week and you are playing well enough , then you are complacent			0
i 'm aware against @entity1 things will be a lot tougher			2
there are going to be harder moments in the second week			0
' last year i was coming to the tournament having not played at the @entity92 and missed quite a bit of tennis			0
because of the grass it was important for me to get a good start in the tournament because maybe physically i was n't in my best shape			0
this year i do n't see that being a problem			0
' @entity2 has faced @entity1 twice			1
he won their first meeting back in 2010 at the @entity104 then lost at the @entity105 the following year			0
he was n't a @entity19 winner at that stage , of course			0
@entity2 has experience of playing tall players ; he has met @entity112 's 6ft 11in @entity113 five times , including on grass , and won all five and played the @entity10 's 6ft 10in @entity117 twice and won both			1
' @entity1 does n't serve as big as them but he is probably better from the back of the court , ' said @entity2			1
' he has a better return game than @entity117 and @entity113			0
there might be more chances to break but equally he will return better and make more balls when you are serving			0
up for it : @entity2 will see the gradient of the challenge rise steeply , facing 6ft 8in @entity1 ' i 'd say @entity1 is more mobile than @entity113			1
most of the big guys now who play from the back of the court are pretty good movers			0
' @entity2 is one of the finest returners in the game but he will do some preparatory work with one of his coaching team , @entity140 , on facing @entity1 's serve			1
' he 's obviously serving different angles at different heights , so the ball 's bouncing up much higher			2
i 'll have @entity140 serve at me from just behind the service line			0
that 's really the only thing i do differently			2
' the ease of @entity2 's progress means he spent less time on court than his key rivals as he overcame @entity151 , @entity152 and then , on friday evening , @entity153			1
with new coach @entity154 helping him maintain his on - court composure , @entity2 has looked quietly confident , certainly calm			1
' i 'm in familiar surroundings			0
that 's going to make you feel more comfortable			2
just being at home , staying in your own bed , having all of your friends and family around you - you 're going to feel more relaxed away from the court			0
' the nerves and the pressure here are also different to other tournaments for me , as well			0
it 's probably greater here than it is at the other @entity19			2
i 'm not scared of that feeling			0
' i felt like i 've played my best tennis when i 've been under pressure			0
i obviously love playing here			0

@entity2 's next challenge is the 6ft 8in @entity1
the @entity10 has been practising with @entity2 's former coach @entity3
@entity2 has faced @entity1 twice , with one win each
