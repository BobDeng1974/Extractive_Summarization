@entity21 who served as mansion director described @entity29 as ' sneaky ' and someone who frequently yelled at staff
@entity107 , former chief of staff to the former @entity5 first lady described her as a ' nutbag '
but both described the @entity129 as a pair who ' seemed like a very happy , in - love couple '
that description is at odds with defense attorneys who claim the marriage was crumbling
they *'ve* argued that the couple could n't have been involved in a conspiracy because they never talked to each other
