just a week after @entity2 - born ginger jihadist @entity1 appeared in a propaganda video released by @entity4 , the teenager has resurfaced in another			1
the 17 - year - old , who grew up in @entity6 in @entity8 's west , is seen in the latest video on the banks of the @entity11 , surrounded by dozens of men dressed in black wielding weapons			1
the production , titled @entity15 on the banks of the @entity17 , is more than six minutes long and shows throngs of militants praying and chanting			1
throughout the piece various men address the group , reciting chants they appear to be reading from some sort of script			0
at other times the men are shown sharing a meal together as they cross the river in a barge			0
those listening will then repeat parts of the chant back at the speaker , and it is one of these scenes that @entity1 appears			0
the teenager is wearing the same black and white keffiyeh he was seen in the previous video , and is flanking a man speaking to the group			0
the 17 - year - old sits next to a man who is chanting in @entity58 at some points the teenager , who grew up in @entity6 in @entity8 's west , appears to stifle a smile or laughter at one point @entity1 seems to stifle a smile or laughter as he looks down , away from the camera while repeating a chant			1
his eyes dart around as he listens to one of the other militants speak , and the video looks to have been produced to exhibit comradery and unity of the @entity4 fighters			1
while most of the video is in @entity58 , the @entity2 report that some of the speakers said in the footage they will : ' will strike the necks of the infidel and @entity83 countries '			2
this comes after the government said they would be willing to work with young @entity2 who had gone to fight in the @entity86 but changed their minds before entering battle			1
just last week @entity1 appeared in a chilling video where he condemned @entity90 and @entity91 he fled @entity8 in june , telling his mother he was going on a fishing trip but instead boarding a flight to the @entity86 a spokeswoman for the attorney general @entity96 told the publication they wanted ' impressionable youth ' to be able to work with @entity2 authorities , but more serious offenders would be prosecuted back home			1
earlier this week reports @entity1 could face 25 years behind bars should he ever return to @entity2 soil emerged			1
@entity107 counterterrorism head @entity105 told the @entity108 that @entity1 , who now goes by the moniker @entity110 , has ' basically admitted he is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation '			0
in the latest footage @entity1 is seen in the same keffiyeh as last week 's and is still clutching a large gun ' the fact that he is admitting that he is a member of @entity22 , which he does in the video , straight away says that he has committed an offence under the criminal code			2
that â€™s up to 25 years imprisonment , ' he said			0
professor @entity121 , from @entity123 's @entity122 , said @entity1 was recruited by another wanted terrorist , @entity124 , an @entity2 based in @entity125			2
he said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media , like many sexual predators			0
he said the boy appeared as a ' pawn in the machine ' in the first chilling video			0
this comes as @entity2 authorities have warned that anyone returning from fighting overseas will be thrown in jail back home			2

@entity1 has appeared in a second @entity4 propaganda video
the latest production is titled @entity15 on the banks of the @entity145
the ' ginger jihadi ' can be seen chanting *alongside* other militants
this comes as the @entity2 government has *re-issued* a warning that returning fighters will be imprisoned on home soil
less than a week *ago* he fronted a video issuing a warning to @entity91
the 17 - year - old fled @entity2 in june to fight in the @entity86
