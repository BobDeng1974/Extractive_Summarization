ambitious members of @entity1 had been turned down by @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and even the @entity21 before the singer appeared to show an interest			1
her agent sent an email saying : ' there is a possibility that @entity2 will be available and hopefully can attend your carnival event			2
' but after a ten minute meeting with red - faced executives , the plans were quickly scuppered after it emerged @entity2 could not appear for free and would require a £ 50,000 fee			1
an email confirmation of the meeting read : ' after our conversation , it is apparent there is some miscommunication			0
' @entity2 will require an appearance fee to attend your carnival			2
' regrettably , it is unlikely your carnival will be able to attract the audience required or have the necessary experience to handle such a large event			0
' the @entity1 in august includes a procession , a bonny baby competition , spot - the - stranger and clairvoyant evening and last year made £ 1,200 for charity			1

he added : ' we are really trying to build it up and make it bigger and better than ever before			0
' i think the carnival is so old - fashioned			0
we want to keep it traditional , but it needs to be modernised to attract the younger generation			0
