@entity0 has responded to an @entity3 court 's latest decision to reconvict her of murder , saying the decision is not based hard evidence			1
in an interview with @entity9 , @entity7 was mostly composed as she explained her legal defense and her frustration with the court 's consideration of circumstantial over forensic evidence			1
but she became emotional several times , tearing up , when she talked about the relationship she had with @entity20 roommate @entity18			1
' i did not kill my friend			0
i did not wield a knife			0
i had no reason to , ' she said			0
that conviction was thrown out four years later and @entity7 was allowed to return home to the @entity38			1
victim : @entity7 was first convicted of killing @entity20 roommate @entity18 in 2007			1
she was allowed to return to the @entity38 four years later when that decision was overturned			2
but the case was brought up again this year but the case was brought up again this year and on tuesday an @entity3 court issued a 337 - page report , which finds that @entity7 stabbed @entity32 to death in a fight over money			1
according to the report , known as a ' motivation ' of the sentence , @entity7 inflicted the fatal knife wound to @entity32 , a student at @entity54			1
the document states : ' it is a matter of fact that at a certain point in the evening events accelerated ; the @entity60 girl was attacked by @entity0 , by @entity61 , who was backing up his girlfriend , and by @entity63 , and constrained within her own room			0
' it adds that it 's difficult to establish a reason for the brutal slaying of ms @entity32 , but goes on to cite allegations of tension between @entity7 and the student			2
it also refers to a statement that @entity63 made to police that ms @entity32 believed @entity7 stole 300 euros ( £ 246 ) - and two credits cards - from her , which is described as a ‘ valid motive ’ for the murder			1
@entity7 is dumbfounded by the court 's conclusions , saying she saved up money to go to @entity3 and was n't financially strained			1
that 's compared to @entity18 , who was seperately convicted of @entity32 's murder and testified in this latest case			0
couple : @entity7 and @entity87 served four years in prison before being acquitted and released			1
however , they were reconvicted by the @entity91 appeals court on january 30 , and sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively @entity7 says he was ' a known thief , a known burglar who did this on a regular basis to survive '			1
jailed : @entity63 is currently serving a 16 - year sentence for the murder of ms @entity32 she also finds it disheartening that the court seems to value his testimony more than hers			1
the latest trial also points to dna evidence found of @entity7 and then boyfriend @entity61 at the crime scene , which she says is unspurising considering she lived there for a month			0
the crucial difference between @entity7 and @entity63 , she says , is that his dna was mixed up with @entity32 's			2
' if i were there , i would have traces of @entity18 's broken body on me and i would have left traces of myself around @entity18 's corpse , ' she said			0
' and i am not there and that proves my innocence			0
@entity7 is currently appealing the case from the @entity38 and it will next go to the @entity120			0
the judge who originally ruled out @entity7 's conviction responded to the latest decision as well , telling @entity9 it is a ' result of fantasy '			2
' the @entity126 has written a script for a movie or a thriller book while it should have only ocnsidered facts and evidence , ' now retired judge @entity132 wrote			0
@entity7 says @entity134 's statement give her hope that the @entity120 will again throw out the case , freeing her and @entity61			0
but if the @entity120 confirms the case , which @entity132 believes is likely , @entity3 could be called back to prison			2
support : judge @entity140 ( left ) has condemned a report stating that @entity0 ( right ) murdered @entity20 student @entity18 - claiming it is more like a ' script for a movie or thriller book ' than evidence experts believe the @entity38 would n't extradict @entity7 back to @entity3 , allowing her to say in the @entity38 , but she calls that kind of existance ' not liveable '			1
ex-boyfriend @entity61 is in @entity3 and wo n't be able to escape the court 's sentence			0
@entity7 says she considers herself lucky though , that people have continued to support her and take an interest in her case - that she has n't been forgotten			2
for now , she 's taking the case step by step and trying not to think of what might happen in the end			0
she 's holding hope that the case is overturned and she can move on with her life which has been ' weighed down ' by the ' tremedous mess ' .			0

the @entity30 , @entity31 *native* told @entity9 that there was no motivation to kill her @entity20 roommate
