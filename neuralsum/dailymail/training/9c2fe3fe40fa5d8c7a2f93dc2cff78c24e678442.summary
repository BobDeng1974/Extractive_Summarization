by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 15:10 est , 10 january 2013 planning minister @entity1 will use a speech today to warn homes need to be built on green sites or else only the rich will be able to afford homes @entity7 will be dragged back to the 19th century when home ownership was the preserve of the wealthiest unless homes are built on untouched greenfield land , the planning minister warns			1
@entity1 will dramatically raise the stakes over the housing crisis , saying the government has a ‘ moral ’ duty to force councils to find land for development to defend @entity19 ’s dream of a ‘ property owning democracy ’			1
and he has warned grandparents who oppose new housebuilding risk ' propping up their kids and their grandkids ' who can not afford to buy their home own			0
he has unveiled plans to bribe local communities with hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash to accept new house building			1
in future , neighbourhood groups who back plans for estates will be handed money to build community centres , save a pub or re-roof the local church			2
mr @entity1 will also deliver a threat to town hall chiefs , warning those who refuse to find land to build on will be overruled			1
ministers have given council bosses until march to come up with land to build 270,000 homes for each of the next five years			1
mr @entity1 has previously sparked controversy by revealing that greenfield land equal to the area of @entity50 will have to be built on to solve the housing shortage			1
in a speech in @entity50 to the leading centre - right think tank @entity54 , which mr @entity1 set up , he said : ‘ we can turn a blind eye while @entity19 ’s dream of a property - owning democracy shrivels			1
‘ we can pass by on the other side while working men and women in their twenties and thirties have to live with their parents or share bedrooms with friends			0
‘ we can shrug our shoulders as home ownership reverts to what it was in the 19th century : a privilege , the exclusive preserve of people with large incomes or wealthy parents			0
‘ or we can accept that we are going to have to build on previously undeveloped land and resolve that we will make these decisions locally			1
’ in a warning shot at green groups and rural campaigners who have opposed the government ’s liberalisation of planning laws , mr @entity1 added ‘ we simply ca n’t squeeze much more out of brownfield sites ’ which have been built on before			2
mr @entity1 will vow to protect the greenbelt and areas of outstanding natural beauty			2
but he said people who have been lucky enough to buy a home should not oppose extra houses for the next generation			0
people had to recognise that ' either they will spend their retirement propping up their kids and their grandkids , or they can accept more development so their grandkids do n’t have the problem , ' he told the @entity99			2
' i genuinely think that the single biggest way in which we are failing to deliver social justice in this country at the moment is unaffordable housing – more than schools , more than jobs , more than benefits , ' he said			0
home ownership in @entity111 fell for the first time in 60 years during 2011 from 68 per cent to 63 per cent			2
mr @entity1 has previously sparked controversy by revealing greenfield land equal to the size of @entity50 will have to be built on to ease the housing shortage mr @entity1 will starkly detail the way price rises have excluded millions from the housing market over the past 30 years			1
if the price of food had risen at the same rate as housing over the past 30 years , a supermarket chicken would now cost £ 47 and a jar of instant coffee £ 20			2
he will say : ‘ no aspiration is more deeply embedded in the @entity7 psyche than the desire to own your own home			0
‘ but the prospect of doing so has been slipping ever further out of the reach of millions of hard - working people			0
‘ this is a result of our decades - long failure to build enough houses			0
and the root cause of this is our decades - long refusal to release enough land for development			2
’ if the price of food had risen at the same rate as housing over the past 30 years , a supermarket chicken would now cost £ 47 , mr @entity1 will say the policy would allow neighbourhood groups , along with parish councils , to get together and approve development plans to build homes			1
local people would be asked to back them in a referendum			0
those communities would then receive a slice of a fund called the @entity157 to spend on local improvements – worth around £ 500,000 to a group of local residents			0
mr @entity1 will say : ‘ this government is determined to persuade communities to accept more house - building by giving them a tangible share of the benefits it brings			1
’ but councils who fail to help out will be overruled using the government ’s @entity170			0
mr @entity1 will say : ‘ they must identify immediately developable sites sufficient to supply all of the new homes that are needed over the next five years			1
‘ some are dragging their feet			0
and a few are looking for ways to evade their responsibilities			0
councils which do not produce credible plans to meet local housing need will find that the presumption in favour of sustainable development will trump local decisions			1
‘ the government will not support those local councils who abdicate their responsibility to meet their fair share of our common housing needs			0
’ mr @entity1 will also take aim at @entity195 , saying the last government only built 147,000 new homes a year while running an open - door immigration policy which helped increase the population of the @entity7 by 3.8million between 2001 and 2011 .			1
