heard the one about the golf course which banned golf buggies ? or the chip shop which stopped customers using salt and vinegar ? they might sound like bad jokes - but they are actually just some of the bizarre excuses which have been trotted out in the name of health and safety			1
in the most recent example , a customer in @entity14 was told he could not put his own salt and vinegar on his take - away fish and chips			1
the bizarre incident was referred to the @entity37 's ' myth busting ' panel , which works to ensure rules are not used irrationally			1
since it was set up in april 2012 , the panel has dealt with nearly 350 cases of gone - wrong health and safety rules , once described by @entity44 as the ' national neurosis '			1
another example from last month 's panel included a primary school banning parents from bringing young babies to sit on their laps during the nativity play			0
but the panel concluded that the school had probably just made the ruling to prevent the children disturbing the performance - and that it had nothing to do with health and safety			1
this year , @entity61 and @entity62 also decided to close the beach on christmas day over ' safety fears ' after a swimmer had to be rescued while taking part in the event three years ago			2
the so - called ' myth busters ' at the @entity37 are now calling on businesses to stop blaming health and safety for poor or over-the - top decisions			1
it comes as researchers at the @entity74 found that half of all cases came related to shops , cafes and leisure centres - which the @entity37 said is usually a cover - up for poor business practice			1
@entity82 , chair of @entity37 and the @entity84 , said : ' @entity37 wants to encourage everyone , especially those working in leisure and retail , to make a resolution to stop using the health and safety catch - all excuse			1
' give the real reason for the decision you take			0
we want people to be honest - giving health and safety the blame is lazy and unhelpful			1
@entity61 and @entity62 banned a @entity100 day swim after two previous incidents due to health and safety			1
pictured : the @entity104 swim in 2011 one customer was not allowed to return headphones because the packet was open ( left ) while another customer was confused when a trolley assistant on his train insisted they physically put his coffee onto his table for ' health and safety reasons ' ( right ) ' customers are at the heart any business			1
getting rid of over-the - top decisions blamed on health and safety will improve the service customers receive and enable the business to prosper			1
' in another bizarre incident this year , a @entity123 store refused to cut a door to size , claiming that cutting the wood would compromise the strength of the door , thereby contravening health and safety legislation			1
a customer was also left baffled when a trolley assistant on his train journey insisted she had to put the coffee cup on the table rather than handing it to him , again for ' health and safety '			1
earlier this year , a local furniture store told a customer 's wife that she could not collect her foot stool from the store due to health and safety - even though the item would have fitted perfectly in her car			1
the business stated that the item had to be delivered , which cost around £ 30			1
the panel concluded this was a ' poor excuse '			0
in another incident , a high street clothing store would not open their fitting rooms on the first day of a sale , apparently due to health and safety			1
@entity156 said over-the - top interpretations of health and safety rules ' get in the way of what the law is for ' and a customer who bought some headphones from a high street store was told that if the packaging was opened the headphones could not be returned , even though they had not been used			1
researchers found that 60 per cent of cases were due to a generic ' better safe than sorry ' risk averse mind - set , which was especially strong in instances of poor customer service			2
in 32 per cent of cases , there was an assumption that there is a rule in place when there is not			0
and the study also found that 20 per cent of the health and safety myths affect children , meaning they were ' frequently prevented from engaging in activities in educational and leisure settings on the grounds of health and safety that are found to be baseless '			1
dr @entity188 said : ' identifying these trends will enable the @entity37 to develop more focussed communications strategies that tailor advice and raise awareness in specific sectors and about particular populations			1
' it will also enable them to support organisations to address the weaknesses in capacity that make health and safety myths more likely			1
' in previous cases , a local council was refusing to allow hanging baskets for a @entity205 in @entity207 competition until engineers had assessed the lampposts to show they were capable of holding the bracket and basket			0
the panel ruled this was a ' classic case ' of rules being applied in an ' overly - cautious and inappropriate way '			0
earlier this year , a six - year - old from @entity218 was also told that she could not take a baby chick into school for a presentation amid fears that children could contract bird flu			0
the little girl 's father , @entity225 , described the rule as ' ridiculous ' and said he had even offered to bring in gel for the children to clean their hands with			0
in another case , a local council in @entity232 banned a dog training club over allergy fears			0
the club , which had been running in a community hall for 60 years , was banned because the council claimed that those using the hall next door might be allergic to dogs or catch a disease from the pets			0
one council refused to put up hanging baskets for a @entity205 in @entity207 competition until lampposts had been checked the myth buster panel said : ' this is a clear example of health and safety being misused			1
any concerns about allergies and cleanliness can be easily managed			0
' in june last year , a mother in @entity255 was told by the headteacher that her seven - year - old daughter was no longer allowed to wear her homemade frilly socks because they could become a tripping hazard			0
but the @entity37 panel again dismissed the rule			2
a spokesman said : ' there is nothing in health and safety law which stipulates how long or short frills on school girls ' socks should be			2
' these socks are unlikely to be a serious hazard unless they are torn and trailing on the floor			0
if you tried to ban everything children could trip over , they would n't be able to do anything			0
' schools are free to set their own uniform policies but these decisions should n't hide behind spurious references to health and safety law			2
' in the golf example , buggies were prohibited because they were not ' health and safety authorised '			2
other examples include a council which stopped a nursery teacher taking children to an allotment , and a manager who banned a woman from wearing flip flops in the office because they did not have enclosed toes and a supported back			0
@entity297 @entity156 said : ' the @entity37 has done fantastic work over the past 40 years to keep working people safe			2
' elf n safety ' myths get in the way of what the law is for – saving lives , not stopping people living them			0
' no employer or worker should hide behind the health and safety excuses , if they act in a sensible way			2
if you hear of a bogus health and safety myth , report it to our panel			2
' set up in april 2012 , the myth - busting panel invites those who believe they are victims of a ludicrous health and safety ruling to email in and get a professional view			2
the panel may then contest decisions made by insurance companies , local authorities and employers			0
there have been nearly 350 cases			0
in @entity14 , a customer was told they were not allowed to put their own salt and vinegar on their take - away fish and chips			1
this @entity100 , a primary school stated that parents could not bring young babies to sit on their laps at the nativity play for ' health and safety ' reasons			2
earlier this year , a local furniture store told a customer 's wife that she could not collect her foot stool from the store due to health and safety - even though the item will fit perfectly well in her car , the business stated that it had to be delivered costing around £ 30 , which the panel said was a ' poor excuse '			1
in @entity357 , small wooden canes protecting daffodil canes were pulled out of the ground in case someone tripped over them and fell into a flowerbed			0
a primary school in @entity364 told pupils that they needed to wear goggles - if they wanted to play with conkers at school			0
the rule came after the local council attempted to ban children from playing conkers in the playground			0
previously , a local council was refusing to allow hanging baskets to be placed on lamppost for a @entity205 in @entity207 competition until engineers had assessed the lampposts			0
in 2012 , a @entity380 was not allowed to ride his float in @entity382 - despite the tradition being around for decades			0
the ban was imposed after health and safety assessments found the sleigh too dangerous , instead @entity100 had to walk alongside his sleigh in 2008 , children were banned from taking part in a sack race in @entity393 because teachers feared they would hurt themselves			2
instead pupils was asked to run or skip			0
a town council near @entity397 created a policy preventing loose flowers and pots being placed on graves .			0

man told he could not salt his own chips due to alleged health and safety
shop later said it could not be sure where customers ' hands had been
just one of the bizarre incidents referred to @entity37
one woman made to pay £ 30 delivery for foot stool as collecting herself was ' unsafe '
another man could not return his *unused* headphones as packet was open
@entity37 is now urging businesses to stop blaming health and safety rules
