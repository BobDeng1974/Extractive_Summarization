the series of ads , which launched last october , featured the 50 - year - old actor playing two characters : a handsome @entity4 in a slick suit who is always the @entity0 customer and then an ' odd or awkward alter - ego ' who was a cable user			1
' the @entity8 report highlighted a number of inaccurate claims concerning signal reliability , shorter customer service wait times , better picture and sound quality and a better sports package			1
other issues included the ' superiority message ' of @entity4 's closing phrase , as well as @entity0 's ' rated no. 1 claim ' and another that stated that it has been ' ranked higher than cable for over 10 years			0
' the @entity8 also recommended that @entity0 ' either discontinue the price claim featured in the " @entity48 @entity4 " commercial or modify it to reflect the price of a package that included the sports programming featured in the commercial			0
' ' while humor can be an effective and creative way for advertisers to highlight the differences between their products and their competitor 's , humor and hyperbole do not relieve an advertiser of the obligation to support messages that their advertisements might reasonably convey â€” especially if the advertising disparages a competitor 's product , ' the @entity8 said on tuesday			0
a @entity8 report highlighted a series of inaccuracies concerning signal reliability , shorter customer service wait times , better picture and sound quality ' given the absence in the record of supporting evidence , @entity8 recommended the advertiser discontinue the claims			1

' we always reserve the right to bring back the @entity4 campaign , either in its current form or with new spots , it has been extremely successful for the brand			0
