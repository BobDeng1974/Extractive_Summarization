for millenia we have found comfort in the light from a flickering fire and the rising sun. but light also takes many forms that are largely invisible and undetectable without modern technology			1
now a new @entity9 exhibition , entitled the @entity10 , is showcasing the wonder of light in all its forms			1
microscopic images as well as photos of natural wonders such as the @entity17 are featured in a new exhibition that forms part of @entity9 ’s @entity10			1
this image shows crystals of cold medication and sodium citrate taken using a camera attached to a microscope			2
it was taken in polarised light , when light is restricted to vibrating in one plane it aims to raise awareness of the achievements of light science , its applications , and its importance to humankind			1
‘ @entity37 allows us to communicate , entertain , explore , and understand the world we inhabit and the @entity40 we live in , ’ the exhibition website says			1
‘ this exhibition series shows the myriad things light can do , and how it plays a critical role in our lives every day			1
’ the year aims to raise awareness of the achievements of light science , its applications , and its importance to humankind			1
this beautiful scene in the @entity48 in south eastern @entity49 , shows bioluminescence as well as stars in the @entity52			0
it 's produced by a chemical reaction inside a living organism			0
most bioluminescence occurs in deep water where sunlight can not reach all lasers are based on controlling the way that energised atoms release photons , or packets of light			2
lasers emit light coherently allowing it to be focused to a tight spot up close or over long distances			2
the image on the left shows how beaming a laser into the sky , astronomers can measure the blurring effects of the @entity76 's atmosphere , allowing for clearer images of distant cosmic objects			2
the image on the right shows shadows in @entity82 in @entity83 as sunlight streams through an opening above a microscopic image showing a tall green plant with yellow flowers called levisticum ( pictured ) is among those on show			0
polarised light is used to bring out the details of the plant , but is also used for sunglasses , for example			2
polarised glasses block most light oriented in a horizontal direction , which often happens when light is reflected from a flat road or smooth water among the pictures currently on show are microscopic images showing the composition of cold medication in polarised light , the cells in a mouse 's eyes , as well as light bulbs under an x-ray and fibre optics , which are used to connect the world			1
natural wonders such as bioluminescence on a beach , impressive sundogs in the snow , @entity115 , dramatic lightning strikes , fireworks and cosmic images of the @entity52 also form part of the gallery			1
natural wonders such as dramatic lightning strikes against city spaces ( pictured ) are included in the gallery			1
this image shows the @entity131 in @entity132			0
in storm clouds , the friction between particles builds up a large separation of electric charge , creating voltages approaching 100 million volts			0
this causes a discharge that heats the gas around it to ten thousand degrees , causing a bright glow observed as a lightning bolt a laser scanning microscope scans a sample point - by - point , assembling the pixel information to generate one image , forming a high - resolution and high - contrast image in three dimensions			2
this image shows a mouse retina , where the cells have been stained with fluorescent dye to show different features solar panels ( pictured ) allow us to harness some of the vast energy that is provided to us every day from the @entity160 cells within the solar panels generate electrical power by converting light from the @entity164 into electricity using semiconducting material such as silicon			1
many people consider solar power as one of the most promising sources of renewable energy this image shows the @entity164 in ultraviolet light through a telescope with better resolution than the most sophisticated high - definition television			1
this telescope , called the @entity178 , gets these amazing views of our closest star in an orbit high above the @entity76 's atmosphere			0
this gives it unfettered access to ten different wavelengths of light being emitted from the sun the @entity10 aims to inspire future scientists and engineers , while also promoting the possibilities of using solar power in the developing world and advances in medicine , communications and astronomy , for example			1
the @entity199 , who is patron of the project in the @entity202 , said : ‘ @entity203 is about how we have used light over the centuries ; it is how we are applying light , photonics and various other aspects in order to make the world a better place , not only for ourselves , but for future generations			1
’ this intriguing photo shows a ' sun dog ' - a pair of bright lights seen on either side of the sun , typically when it is setting			0
sun dogs belong to a large class of atmospheric phenomena caused by the bending of sunlight by small ice crystals in the air			0
the crystals act as prisms , bending the light rays			2
if the crystals are randomly oriented in the atmosphere , a complete ring around the @entity164 a halo is seen ( shown ) optical fibres ( shown ) - hair - thin flexible strands of glass or plastic - carry massive amounts of data in the form of light and serve as the backbone of the @entity240			0
they can be used in endoscopes for imaging the interiors of both people and machines			0
or as fibre lasers , can generate light energy to cut everything from human tissue to thick steel @entity251 , or ' first animals ' are single - celled animals that play a key role in maintaining and balance of microbial life			2
this photograph illuminates one particular type of protozoa called vorticella using a technique called dark field microscopy , which blocks out the direct light from the source , so that only light scattered by the specimen is observed , enabling brilliant bright images to be seen again a dark background this year has been chosen by the @entity269 , because it marks a number of anniversaries of significant discoveries , such as early works of optics by @entity275 in 1015 and the centenary of @entity278 ’s theory of relativity			1
@entity275 , the @entity281 polymath , made contributions to the principles of optics , visual perception and astronomy			1
his research on optical systems using mirrors led to the discovery that the angle of incidence and refraction does not remain constant and he investigated the magnifying power of lenses			0
throughout the year , events will take place across the world to celebrate the applications of light			1
scientists have captured x-ray emissions from young stars with masses similar to our @entity164 outside our @entity52 galaxy for the first time			0
in this composite image of the @entity309 - one of our galaxy 's closest neighbours - optical data from the @entity314 is shown in red , green and blue and infrared data from the @entity317 is shown in red while the first headlights on cars were fuelled by kerosene or acetylene , today 's versions are far safer and more effective			0
newer cars use halogen or light - emitting diodes ( leds ) instead of incandescent bulbs , but reflected lasers may be used in the future			0
this image combines eight photos , each lasting for 30 seconds , showing traffic on a road for centuries , lighthouses have kept mariners safe by illuminating rough stretches of water and dangerous rocks			0
this image of a lighthouse off the west coast of @entity345 has additional beautiful illuminated elements			0
from the top left to the lower right in the sky , @entity350 , @entity351 , and the @entity352 reflecting light from the sun can be seen hanging over @entity355 , in @entity356 together with the sun , most people instantly think of light bulbs when considering light			0
this image shows assorted bulbs as a coloured x-ray			0

images of different forms of light , from polarised microscope images to lightning strikes are featured in a new exhibition that forms part of @entity9 ’s @entity10 , which runs this year
it aims to raise awareness of the achievements of light science , its applications , and its importance to humankind
this year has been chosen by the @entity269 , because it marks a number of anniversaries of significant discoveries , such as early works of optics by @entity275 in 1015 and the centenary of @entity278 ’s theory of relativity
throughout the year , events will take place across the world to celebrate the many applications of light , such as solar panels and renewable energy , advances in medicine , communications and astronomy , for example
