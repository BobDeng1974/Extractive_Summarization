by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 10:48 pm on 30th august 2011 as ravaged areas try to pick up the pieces from the wrath of @entity6 , a new threat may be churning in the @entity7			1
@entity8 was born at about 5am eastern time on tuesday , upgraded from a tropical depression that formed yesterday			2
like @entity6 , @entity8 formed from the tropical waves off @entity12 ’s @entity11 , and could gain enough steam in the warm water to collect hurricane strength			1
' we ’re in the peak of the hurricane season			0
this is when you 're going to see most of the storms and they ’re not all going to take the same track			0
' @entity32 , a senior hurricane specialist at the @entity34 , told @entity35 : ' it 's still well out to sea			2
a lot of things can happen			0
despite the fact that @entity8 ’s path is unknown even to the experts , mr @entity32 recommended that the @entity42 and the @entity43 ' keep an eye ' on the storm			1
keeping up with @entity8 : the experts say it 's ' far too early to tell ' whether @entity8 will take the same path as @entity6 as @entity6 battered the @entity42 this weekend , it appeared @entity50 was next in line for the @entity7 hurricane season , but that storm sputtered almost as fast as it formed			1
' [ @entity50 ] died a quick death , ' mr @entity22 said			0
meanwhile , storm - ravaged areas from @entity56 to @entity57 are fighting to survive after @entity6 levelled structures , knocked out power and spawned rivers of epic flooding			1
the small town of @entity63 , @entity64 in the @entity65 has nearly been wiped off the map after @entity6 tore through the area , taking out bridges and destroying homes			1
on monday night , police helicopters rescued 21 people left stranded by the floods , including a pregnant woman and four young children , @entity76 group took shelter in a home after intense rain and treacherous flooding crippled all bridges leading into and out of the town			1
the dramatic rescue came after some 87 people were plucked from the area on sunday			2
another 40 people remain holed up at the @entity86			0
catastrophe , before and after : the @entity88 in @entity89 was heavily damaged after @entity6 tore through the area			1
path of destruction : a once - quiet country road is now littered with homes and pieces of homes in the @entity96 of @entity63 bridge to nowhere : dozens of residents in the town of @entity63 have been stranded after its bridges were destroyed @entity102 , youth leader at the centre , told @entity76 : ' there are some here that have nothing to go back to , so they do n't know how long it 's going to be			1
' and @entity63 's not alone , as thousands of residents as far north as @entity57 were left homeless by @entity6 's unprecedented flooding			1
@entity112 's home in @entity113 , @entity114 , was completely flooded by the huge torrents that have swept across the region - and she and her husband have no flood insurance			1
' we have got to start all over , ' she said			0
' we 'll be all right			0
' the flooding has brought the death toll from hurricane @entity6 to 46 with whole towns swept away and the state of @entity57 particularly badly affected			1
@entity124 and firefighters rescued hundreds from record flooding in @entity127 on tuesday as @entity57 planned to airlift food and water to inland towns cut off by @entity6			1
time to go : @entity131 kisses her husband , @entity132 , as she is evacuated from her flooded home by members of the @entity136 volunteer fire department and the @entity124 in @entity136 , @entity127 @entity138 situation : @entity127 and @entity57 continue to struggle with their worst flooding in decades the storm may have spared @entity64 , but it caused the worst flooding in decades in inland areas of @entity144 , @entity127 and @entity57			1
@entity150 teams have plucked nearly 600 people from homes in recent days with the most intense efforts on tuesday when the @entity154 measured 13 feet above flood stage , the highest level since 1903 , @entity147 police sgt. @entity145 said			1
firefighters rescued some by boat and the @entity124 saved others by truck , taking them to a @entity162 shelter			0
‘ some are standing there in the doorway			0
some are coming out of their windows , ’ @entity145 said			0
‘ it 's raging , ’ he said of the @entity154 , which runs through the centre of town			2
authorities expected the river to begin receding later on tuesday			0
swollen rivers were still cresting on tuesday and flood plains remained under water in northeastern states that were already soaked by an unusually wet summer			2
devastation : intense wind and flooding brought on by @entity6 has left little to come home to in @entity57 utilities restored electricity to roughly half the 6.7 million customers who had power knocked out , and @entity64 mass transit and air travel crept back to normal			1
clear skies in the northeast aided rescue efforts , but hundreds of thousands of homes were damaged , some swept away in the torrent			2
in @entity64 's @entity127 suburbs , flood victims anxiously waited for waters to recede while just a few miles away the city buzzed anew , slowed only temporarily by an unprecedented preemptive shutdown of its mass transit system and an evacuation order on saturday			1
the governor of @entity57 has spoken of the devastation the small rural state suffered at the hands of @entity6 and warned that further flooding and loss of life are likely			1
governor @entity209 said : ' it 's just devastating			0
whole communities under water , businesses , homes , obviously roads and bridges , rail transportation infrastructure			1
we 've lost farmers ' crops			0
we 're tough folks up here but @entity6 ... really hit us hard			2
washed away : residents walk along @entity223 , the main road that connects @entity225 to the main land , near where @entity6 first made landfall on saturday devastation : lock 8 in @entity231 , @entity64 , overflows with water , and a metal barge is crashed into the gates , on monday during extensive flooding in the region as a result of @entity6 ' it 's hard for us to know , frankly , how many are stranded because it 's hard for us to get into the communities we need to get to			1
it really packed a punch			0
it is probably the toughest flooding that we 've seen in the state of @entity57 in our history			1
' we really need more resources but the president has been extraordinarily helpful '			0
highlighting the transportation problems , the @entity251 had to travel through neighbouring @entity114 to get rescue crews to the small , cut - off town of @entity255 , the governor said			2
the death toll for the hurricane has now risen to 46 as towns and cities start the recovery process , with some still grappling with more flooding			2
images of the flooding showed normally tranquil streams pouring through city streets and thrashing against buildings and bridges , including some of the state 's iconic covered bridges			1
four to six of the covered bridges were destroyed in the flooding , officials said			0
from @entity56 to @entity275 , communities cleaned up and took stock of the uneven and hard - to - predict costs of a storm that spared the nation 's biggest city a nightmare scenario , only to deliver a historic wallop to towns well inland			2
collapse : another home destroyed by @entity6 rests on the beach in @entity287 , @entity288 , yesterday many people lost all their worldly possessions in the hurricane and some even their whole homes			1
all that is left of a beach front cottage in @entity295 , @entity56 , owned by the @entity297 family are the steps that once led up to it			0
the @entity297 family 's devastation has been shown in several photographs of the disaster , a father comforting his wife and daughter on the steps leading to where their house once stood , staring at the ocean beyond			0
loss : the @entity297 family looks out at the ocean from the remains of their beachfront home , which was swept away in the wrath of @entity6 beauty : the @entity297 cottage , seen in this 2010 photo , was built in 1903 , and bought by @entity297 's family in 1963 his daughter , @entity319 said : ' we were pretending , just for a moment , that the cottage was still behind us and we were just sitting there watching the sunset			2
' the cottage , which was built in 1903 , was bought by @entity297 's family in 1963			0
since then , it was where the retired art teacher spent his vacations , wooed his wife @entity329 , and gathered with family , according to @entity331 in an article written a year ago that recounts the cottage and its rich history			0
rivers and creeks turned into raging torrents tumbling with tree limbs and parts of buildings in northern @entity341 and @entity89 as the storm 's winds diminished , but the torrential rains refused to let up			1
late last night , the storm continued to batter @entity57 with heavy rains forcing hundreds of evacuations			1
' this is not over , ' president @entity348 said from the @entity350 yesterday			0
' many @entity351 are still at serious risk of power outages and flooding , which could get worse in the coming days as rivers swell past their banks			0
' while the full extent of the damage was not known , early estimates put it up to $ 45billion , including lost business and physical damage			0
power companies said they were trying to get critical services running first			0
but many are just starting to understand the full extent of damage to the grid			0
about 2.8million customers remained without power on tuesday afternoon			0

@entity8 forms off @entity12 's @entity384 's , the same area as @entity6
town of @entity63 , @entity64 , nearly *decimated* by hurricane 's wind , rain and floods
homes and hundreds of roads and bridges washed away in @entity57
high flood waters seemed to come as a surprise to the state where evacuations had not been made
rivers and streams burst banks in @entity89 , @entity288 and @entity114
last night flood waters were rising in @entity127 closing major *highways* including the @entity407
at least 46 people have died in the storm , most of them when trees crashed through roofs or onto cars
