not one but two very familiar faces will be ranged against @entity1 on the support benches as he revisits one of the most highly charged matches of his career			1
@entity6 is his opponent in the semi-final of the @entity8 , the man @entity1 met — and eventually beat — at the same stage of the @entity11 in january			1
it was a match that had everything , with even the saintly @entity14 caught uttering profanities in the direction of the @entity18 powerhouse			2
@entity1 will have to cope with seeing two of his former team in the opposite corner in @entity22 fitness trainer @entity23 ( left ) and coach @entity24 left @entity1 to join @entity6 's team there is no love lost on the tour between the @entity29 no 1 and his @entity18 opponent @entity6 ( right ) much of the build - up to that fractious encounter centred on the fact it was a reunion between @entity1 and his close friend and assistant coach @entity34 , who had switched jobs to work with world no 9 @entity6			1
now there is the added presence of @entity1 ’s former fitness trainer @entity23 , with whom he spent so many painstaking hours becoming a super athlete , following @entity42 into the @entity6 camp while also working with the outstanding @entity45 teenager @entity44			1
by the time they met in @entity49 there had been endless references to people failing to pull in the same direction when on @entity1 ’s team			2
it is fairly clear that meant disagreements over training methods and other matters			0
@entity1 's fiance @entity14 was caught shouting expletives towards @entity6 at the @entity11 @entity1 and @entity6 meet at the net after the @entity63 's semi-final victory in @entity49 in january @entity1 , who after one break in @entity49 pointedly celebrated straight at @entity65 , admits the @entity67 match was difficult due to the intensity of the friendships			1
however , he insists that tension has now dissipated			0
‘ we chat most days when we ’re in the locker room and stuff , ’ said the @entity71			0
‘ in @entity49 it was a bit awkward but now i feel i ’m past that			0
’ he admits to not being close to @entity6			2
and that has not changed			0
@entity1 reached the last four in @entity79 after a three - set defeat of rising prospect @entity81			0

@entity29 no 1 faces @entity6 in the @entity8 semi-finals
