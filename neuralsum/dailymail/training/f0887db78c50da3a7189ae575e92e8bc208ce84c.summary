by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 12:03 est , 16 august 2012 charges have been dropped against a fugitive doctor involved in the nation 's largest prosecution of @entity6 pharmacies because there 's too much evidence - more than 400,000 documents and two terabytes of electronic data that federal authorities say is expensive to maintain			1
in a move which will raise eyebrows , the nine - year investigation against @entity13 who was indicted in 2007 for an illegal multimillion dollar internet drugs scheme has ended			2
a federal judge in @entity19 dismissed the charge last week at the request of prosecutors , who want to throw out the many records collected over their nine - year investigation to free up space			0
in this undated photo provided by the @entity27 of @entity28 is @entity29 dr. @entity13 who is escaping prosecution because of the huge volume of evidence in his case : more than 400,000 documents and two terabytes of electronic data the @entity29 doctor fled to his native @entity37 after coming under investigation in 2004 , and @entity37 authorities say they do not extradite their own citizens			1
given the unlikelihood of capturing @entity13 and the inconvenience of maintaining so much evidence , prosecutors gave up the long pursuit			2
' continued storage of these materials is difficult and expensive , ' wrote @entity48 , the @entity49 attorney for northern @entity19			0
she called the task ' an economic and practical hardship ' for the @entity52			0
the case started in 2003 with a raid of a small @entity56 drugstore and eventually secured the conviction of 26 defendants , including 19 doctors			0
the @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity56 , which was closed after authorities found evidence that it had illegally dispensed drugs on the internet the investigation dismantled two internet pharmacies that illegally sold 30 million pills to customers			1
investigators also recovered $ 7 million , most of which went to @entity19 police agencies that helped with the case			0
when a major drug suspect flees the country , federal authorities often leave the charges pending in the event the fugitive tries to sneak back into the @entity49 or a country with a friendly extradition process			0
but in @entity13 's case , the volume of evidence posed a bigger burden			1
the evidence took up 5 percent of the @entity52 's worldwide electronic storage			1
agents had also kept several hundred boxes of paper containing 440,000 documents , plus dozens of computers , servers and other bulky items			1
two terabytes is enough to store the text of 2 million novels , or roughly 625,000 copies of ' @entity100			1
' two - terabyte memory drives are widely available for $ 100 , but the @entity52 's data server must be relatively small and may need replacement , a costly and risky proposition for an agency that must maintain the integrity of documents , said @entity56 computer scientist @entity108			1
this sept. 12 , 2003 photo shows customers outside the @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity19 , after it was closed by federal agents that found evidence it had illegally dispensed drugs on the internet ' a responsible organization does n't upgrade every time new technology is available			1
that 's all they would be doing , ' @entity108 said			0
' but the result is you end up in situations like this where the capacity they have is not quite up to the incredible volume of data involved			0
' @entity129 , who runs the website whatsabyte.com , which explains electronic storage , said he doubted that storing the data would have been that problematic for the government			2
' i 'm thinking that excuse is just their easy way out , ' he wrote in an e-mail			0
@entity49 district judge @entity138 dismissed the case with prejudice , meaning it can not be refiled			0
@entity13 , 59 , was accused of improperly authorizing thousands of prescriptions for pain pills , diet medication and other drugs while working for @entity145 , a @entity28 - based internet company that operated from 2003 to 2004			1
the company 's doctors approved prescriptions without examining patients , communicating with them or verifying their identities , prosecutors said			0
in these sept. 12 , 2003 photo investigators enter the @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity56 , which was closed after authorities found evidence that it had illegally dispensed drugs on the internet three @entity145 officials and a person who recruited doctors were sentenced to prison			2
eight physicians pleaded guilty to conspiracy to illegally distribute controlled substances and launder the proceeds			0
the investigation began after agents raided the @entity60 in @entity61 and found evidence that it had illegally dispensed medication for @entity145 and another internet company , medical web services , which pleaded guilty			2
eleven of its physicians were also prosecuted			0
@entity13 fled to @entity37 around the time @entity28 regulators suspended his medical license for prescribing controlled substances to @entity176 patients ' in excessive quantities and without medical justification			1
' an audit found his prescriptions cost @entity176 $ 6.5 million over six years and caused addiction and dangerous health risks			0
investigators know @entity13 's whereabouts in @entity37 , which has an extradition treaty with the @entity49 to return fugitives			1
but a spokeswoman for the @entity188 in @entity189 said the country never received a formal extradition petition for @entity13 and that the country 's constitution bars the extradition of @entity37 citizens			1
the dismissal of the charges does not mean @entity13 is free to return to the @entity49 he is still listed as one of @entity28 's most wanted criminals and is being sought for separate medicaid fraud and narcotics charges in that state .			2
