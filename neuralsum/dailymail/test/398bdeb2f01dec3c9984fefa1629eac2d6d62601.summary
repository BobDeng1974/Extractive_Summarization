the parents of a terminally ill boy have fulfilled his dying wish by getting married at his bedside in hospital			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 more than anything wanted to see his parents @entity9 , 28 , and @entity11 , 21 , tie the knot			1
the five - year - old was diagnosed with a complex congenital heart defect at the age of seven months and since then has undergone eight open - heart operations and other treatments			1
@entity11 and @entity18 listen to their wedding vows during their marriage at @entity23 @entity5 ' job was to hold the rings for his parents during the marriage ceremony the five - year - old is suffering from a terminal congenital heart defect and had often asked his parents why they were not married @entity5 has been on the paediatric intensive care unit at @entity23 since january and when doctors gave his parents the devastating news that he may not live much longer , @entity33 and mrs @entity34 decided to get married			1
they had been engaged for three years but plans to tie the knot were put on hold due to the birth of their daughters , two - year - old @entity40 and six - month - old @entity41 , and @entity5 's ill health			1
when they learnt of their son 's wish , they felt there was no time like the present and , with the help of staff and friends made at the hospital , they were able to organise the whole service within 48 hours			1
they made history when they became the first couple to marry at the hospital but had to get special permission from the archbishop of @entity63			1
the law allows couples to marry in hospital if one of them is desperately ill and that did not apply in this case			0
but a law dating back to @entity71 gives the archbishop of @entity63 special dispensation to allow weddings in hospital for ' pastoral reasons '			1
mr @entity5 , a council worker , said : ' a couple of weeks ago we were told they did n't think he would go home			2
we keep hoping that he will but it just looks less likely each day			0
' when we knew @entity5 's wishes , everyone on the paediatric intensive care unit and @entity82 32 , including staff and friends , got together to help us			1
the @entity34 had been engaged for three years but decided to fast track their wedding when they discovered their son @entity5 may not live much longer ' we both planned to get married years ago but decided we would n't get married without @entity5 there , so the only way we could do it was in hospital			1
' he 's asked quite a few times why we are not married , so we thought we would make it a special day and cheer him up a bit			2
' the bishop of @entity97 had to write to the archbishop of @entity63 to get special permission for us to marry in the hospital and we are so grateful he agreed			1
' when we got the go - ahead , we only had a matter of days to plan			0
we rushed into town to buy a dress and suit and made do with our engagement rings as wedding rings			2
' we could n't believe the generosity of all those involved			0
one nurse helped to do @entity11 's hair , whilst another two members of staff made the cake and iced it			1
' chairs were pulled together to form an aisle and decorations were put up to make it feel like a wedding venue			0
' we were married by the hospital 's chaplain , @entity120 , who was very excited to be sharing this occasion with us			2
' however , the most important thing for us was having our son @entity5 at our side , holding the rings and wearing his suit			2
' we could n't have been more proud of him			0
we were also incredibly lucky to have our daughters there and the support of so many			0
' mr @entity5 added : ' it turned into a really , really amazing day and @entity5 was so proud			0
i think he really enjoyed it , which was the main thing			0
' getting married is usually the bride and groom 's special day , which it was , but it 's more @entity5 's special day because he is such a special boy			1
' it was nice to share our special day with the people who have helped us enjoy @entity5 's short life			1
it has got to the point where there is n't more they can do now , which is obviously very hard			0
' instead of being at his bedside crying the whole time at least on that one day we had a real special day			0
we know he was happy that day			0
' when he 's home and well you would n't know he is a cardiac patient			0
he 's happy , running around and loves to play			0
' @entity155 , the paediatric intensive care unit matron , said : ' it was a privilege to share @entity9 and @entity11 's special day with their children @entity5 , @entity40 and @entity41 , family and friends			1
' the whole hospital was abuzz with excitement and one of the nurses made and iced a cake , others brought in flowers and gifts for the newlyweds			2
' lots of the nursing and medical teams involved in @entity5 's care came in over the @entity175 break to share this special occasion with them all			1
' pictured front from left to right on the wedding day is @entity5 and his sisters @entity40 and @entity41			2
across the back is their mother @entity11 , reverend @entity120 and their father @entity18 @entity185 said : ' @entity71 gave the then archbishop of @entity63 this special power to by - pass the law			1
' it was that ancient law from several hundred years ago that was enacted allowing @entity33 and mrs @entity34 to get married			0
it meant a little bit of paperwork to fill out but we were able to get that done in 48 hours			2
' it was very emotional and it was emotional for many reasons			0
the family and the ward knew how special this was for them and it was fulfilling the wish of a dying child			2
' it was also emotional because we knew the outcome for poor @entity5 is n't going to be a good outcome and everyone was just aware of the specialness of the day for @entity33 and mrs @entity34 and @entity5			0
' the newlyweds spent their wedding night at their son 's bedside and later returned to the @entity214 where they are staying whilst @entity5 is in hospital			1
mr @entity5 said : ' it may not have been the day we had initially planned in our heads but it did n't matter to us			0
' to have our son there meant more than anything and it will be a day we will never forget			0
we ca n't thank the staff enough for what they have done for us and @entity5 and we would like them to know how much we appreciate their hard work and dedication			0
