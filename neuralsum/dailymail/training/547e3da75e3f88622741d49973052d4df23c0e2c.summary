by @entity0 for @entity1 thousands of lives could be saved every year if all @entity5 smokers switched from cigarettes to e-cigarettes , experts have said			1
researchers from @entity9 ( @entity9 ) estimated that for every million smokers who switch from tobacco to electronic cigarettes , more than 6,000 premature deaths would be prevented each year in the @entity5			1
there are currently around nine million @entity5 smokers			1
if they all switched to nicotine vapour inhalers , ditching their traditional tobacco products , the scientists predict around 54,000 lives could be saved			1
but the chief executive of the @entity32 today made an urgent call for more research into the effects of e-cigarettes in the face of countless conflicting views			2
dr @entity39 , told @entity1 : ' we are constantly hearing conflicting views around e-cigarettes and we can appreciate that the public are confused about whether the use of e-cigarettes is recommended			0
' this is why we are urgently calling for more research into the health impact of electronic - cigarettes and whether they effectively help smokers quit their habit			1
' the latest study comes just days after a piece of research published by a team at the @entity57 , warned of higher levels of ' harmful and dangerous toxins ' in e-cigarettes compared with traditional products			2
their findings concluded that e-cigarette vapour contains the toxic element chromium , as well as four times more nickel than is found in normal cigarettes			1
the researchers also found the devices contained lead , zinc and other toxic metals , although in lower levels than cigarettes			1
but in an editorial published in the @entity75 , professor @entity76 and dr @entity77 from @entity9 ’s @entity78 have argued that even though some toxins are present in the vapour from e-cigarettes the concentrations are ‘ very low ’			1
the editorial said : ‘ the vapour contains nothing like the concentrations of carcinogens and toxins as cigarette smoke			2
‘ in fact , toxin concentrations are almost all well below 1/20th that of cigarette smoke			0
’ dr @entity39 , chief executive of the @entity32 , today called for urgent research in the face of countless conflicting studies in to the effects of e-cigarettes			0
' we are constantly hearing conflicting views around e-cigarettes and we can appreciate that the public are confused about whether the use of e-cigarettes is recommended , ' she said			0
' this is why we are urgently calling for more research into the health impact of electronic - cigarettes and whether they effectively help smokers quit their habit			1
' once we have this research we can understand , based on factual evidence , whether e-cigarettes could provide an efficient route to stopping smoking and save thousands of lives			1
' until then , we recommend that people trying to quit smoking first use approved nicotine replacement therapies			0
' the @entity120 ( @entity120 ) issued a report advising that the use of e-cigarettes should be banned indoors and all advertising stopped until the industry produces ‘ convincing supporting scientific evidence and obtains regulatory approval ’			0
the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) backed this call			0
@entity129 , deputy chair of the @entity127 ’s board of science , said tight controls are needed so that they are n't aggressively marketed towards young people and so that their sale does n't normalise the act of smoking			2
but professor @entity137 and dr @entity77 moved to dispel the idea			0
they argued that a rise in the use of e-cigarettes has been accompanied by an increase in the numbers of smokers quitting and a continued fall in the numbers of people that smoke			2
meanwhile the number of e-cigarette users who took up the habit having never smoked in the past is ‘ extremely small ’ , they added			0
they wrote : ‘ there are a number of public health advocates who appear to consider electronic cigarettes primarily as a threat to public health , and bodies such as the @entity127 and the @entity120 are warning smokers about their potential dangers			2
‘ given that smokers smoke primarily for the nicotine but die primarily from the tar , one might imagine that e-cigarettes would be welcomed as a means to prevent much of the death and suffering caused by cigarettes			1
’ a @entity120 - commisisoned report on e-cigarettes released in 2013 , before their recent call for further restrictions on the use , sale and promotion of cigarettes , has also come under attack			1
the december 2013 report said that e-cigarette use is a major problem among young people and could be acting as a gateway to smoking			1
it inferred that bystanders can inhale significant levels of toxins and said that the products actually inhibit smoking cessation			2
writing in the journal @entity196 , experts called the report is ‘ misleading ’			0
lead author professor @entity198 from the @entity199 at @entity200 , said : ‘ we were surprised by the negativity of the commissioned review , and found it misleading and not an accurate reflection of available evidence			0
‘ e-cigarettes are new and we certainly do n’t yet have all the answers to their long - term health impact , but what we do know is that they are much safer than cigarettes , which kill over six million people a year worldwide			1
’ the researchers argued that rise in use of e-cigarettes has been accompanied by an increase in the numbers of smokers quitting and a continued fall in the numbers of people that smoke the authors said that the global health body took on the general tone of the recommendations set out in the report - even though concerns had been raised about it by scientists and other public health experts about them			1
but one of the authors of the latest report , professor @entity235 , from the @entity236 at @entity237 , said : ’ the @entity120 report published last week copies these recommendations almost verbatim			0
' i think these type of recommendations are actually detrimental to public health			0
‘ the purpose of these recommendations to restrict the use of e-cigarettes and the reason for doing that is to avoid risk			2
' i think any responsible regulator proposing restricting regulation has to balance reducing risks with reducing potential benefits			0
‘ in this case the risks are unlikely , some already proven not to exist , while the benefits are potentially enormous			0
it really could be a revolutionary intervention in public health if smokers switched from cigarettes to electronic cigarettes			1
‘ so killing benefits , which are huge , for risks which are small is like asking ( people ) to stop using mobile phones and tablets , or restrict their use and further development , because of a one in ten million chance that the battery might overheat in your device			0

@entity9 researchers estimated that for every million smokers who switch to e-cigarettes , 6000 premature deaths would be prevented each year in the @entity5
there are around nine million @entity5 smokers and if they all switched to e-cigarettes , 54,000 lives could be saved
reduced *mortality* rate even accounts for possibility that e-cigarettes may carry an increased risk of death
researchers wanted to dispel *myths* about toxins present in e-cigarette vapour , arguing the concentration is much lower than in cigarettes
also aimed to counter comments about e-cigarettes acting as a ' gateway ' to smoking and *'re* - normalising ' the act of smoking
