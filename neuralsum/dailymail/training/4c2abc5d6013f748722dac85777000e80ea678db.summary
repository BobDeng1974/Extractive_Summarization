@entity0 sent a clear warning to @entity2 after his man - of - the - match performance inspired @entity4 to an emphatic @entity5 win over @entity7			1
the @entity9 centre grabbed two of @entity4 ’s six tries at @entity12 and claimed his best is yet to come in the tournament			1
@entity4 ’s next game is in @entity16 on march 1 - a showdown between the two remaining unbeaten teams after @entity2 saw off @entity19 18 - 11 at the @entity20			1
his @entity9 team - mate @entity21 added 15 points with the boot			1
@entity0 , 23 , has been hailed as the ‘ new @entity25 ’ with his silky running prowess and dashing finishing skills			1
he said : ‘ it ’s great to be compared to someone like him			2
he was someone with such class and ability who had such a great career with @entity9 and @entity4			1
@entity0 enjoyed the comparisons to @entity25 after his man - of - the - match performance the comparisons come from the silky running prowess and finishing skills that the two players share @entity0 scored two tries in a world - class display for @entity4 against @entity7 at @entity12 after also going over against @entity42 , @entity0 now has three tries to his name in this year 's @entity5 ' but it ’s up to me to keep working hard and keep my feet on the ground			1
i am not the finished article and can get better			2
i just want to try to be the best i can			2
it felt great to get two tries in an @entity4 win but things move on quickly and you ca n’t sit back and relax			1
’ @entity0 was forced to move out to the wing after full back @entity56 went off with a head injury early in the first half			1
but the reshuffle did n’t faze the @entity9 man , who said : ‘ i feel i can play either centre or wing but i prefer centre			2
' i try to deliver on a regular basis and i need to keep pushing myself			2
i have trained and worked hard at @entity9			2
i ’ve found that if i stay close to @entity21 he usually creates something for me			2
credit to him today because he helped me go over the whitewash			2
‘ missing out on @entity71 last year was a big blow for me			0
but missing that opportunity made me even more determined to get where i wanted to be			0
‘ i did n’t have a great season and had injuries			0
but it was a realisation that a lot of my friends were out there and that ’s where i wanted to be			0
’ @entity0 crosses over for his second try , but wants to keep his feet on the ground ahead of facing @entity2 the 47 - 17 win at @entity12 saw some early mistakes from @entity4 which need to be ironed out @entity0 set his sights on the battle with @entity2 and said : ‘ it will be another big one and there are a few errors to iron out			1
@entity2 are a tough side and it will be a massive challenge			0
we will have to prepare well for that game			0
’ but @entity94 said his young side , who beat @entity42 in @entity97 last friday , lacked intensity in defence early on as @entity100 crossed			0
the head coach said : ‘ i am disappointed really			0
i thought we lacked the intensity we had in defence last week			0
we addressed it in the second half but the last try was a frustrating one			0
‘ i guess at the start of the day , if someone had said we would get 47 points , i would have taken it			0
i know how good and how difficult this @entity113 team are to play against having been 18 - 11 this time two years ago			1
’ @entity4 lost @entity56 to a worrying injury after 10 minutes and @entity94 hailed his bravery			1
the full back was left unconscious after a collision with @entity7 centre @entity118 and had seven minutes of treatment before being taken off on a stretcher			0
@entity21 ( 10 ) and @entity0 seem to be enjoying playing together , as shown in this try celebration the @entity7 backline struggled to deal with @entity0 , and @entity2 will be wary of him too the 29 - year - old reappeared on the touchline in the second half and will undergo strict return - to - play protocols before being considered to face @entity2			1
@entity94 said : ‘ it was a very dangerous moment			0
it was a great chip over the top and — typical @entity56 — he was brave and it was a try - saver			1
‘ he is talking fine now and he seems ok			0
it certainly helps the fact that it is two weeks and a day ( until @entity2 ) but we will take him through the return - to - play protocol			1
i spoke to him in the changing room and he was grumpy that he had to miss the game and frustrated — but he is grumpy anyway			0
‘ we have a training week coming up and he wo n’t take any part in that			0
we will see how he goes in the lead - up to the @entity2 game			2
’ @entity56 ’s injury came at the worst possible time for a sport facing a huge challenge to combat an alarming rise in head injuries over the past decade			0
@entity56 had to be taken off after suffering a head injury that saw him bleeding from his nose with the clash against @entity2 now on the horizon , @entity0 hopes @entity4 can stop the mistakes in the break @entity94 had issues with the way his side played but congratulated his man - of - the - match afterwards			1

@entity4 's two - try hero was delighted with comparisons to @entity25
but @entity0 believes both he and @entity4 need to keep grounded
the two unbeaten @entity5 sides face up in @entity16 in a *fortnight*
