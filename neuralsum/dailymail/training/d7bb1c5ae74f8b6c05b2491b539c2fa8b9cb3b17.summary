@entity0 called off sunday 's planned launch of a deep - space observatory — and a revolutionary rocket - landing attempt - after a critical radar - tracking system failed			1
former vice president @entity5 , who first envisioned the observatory two decades ago , was on hand for the attempt			0
the @entity0 company halted the countdown at the 2½ - minute mark following the loss of the @entity14 radar system for tracking the rocket in flight			1
chief executive officer @entity17 said via @entity18 that the company would try again monday and that the delay probably was for the best			1
liftoff has now been postponed until monday @entity30 , we have a problem : @entity17 's @entity0 was forced to scrub a planned launch sunday evening in which it was to attempt to land the first stage of a rocket onto a platform floating in the @entity37 ' will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter , ' the company 's billionaire founder wrote , adding that it was not needed for launch , ' but nice to have			1
' besides launching its first deep space mission — an observatory that will shoot to a spot 1 million miles from @entity47 to monitor solar outbursts — @entity0 will attempt its second landing of a leftover booster on an ocean platform			1
it 's part of the company 's plan to eventually reuse rockets			1
the @entity27 is refashioned from the @entity47 - observing satellite conceived in the late 1990s by @entity5 when he was vice president			0
it was canceled before ever flying and packed away until several years ago , when @entity57 , the @entity58 and @entity14 decided to resurrect it as a space weather sentinel			0
@entity5 arrived at @entity61 well in advance of the sunset liftoff , eager to see his brainchild finally soar			0
try , try , try again : the launch was the company 's second attempt to land a rocket booster -- an event that , if successful , could be a significant step toward making space travel far more affordable boom ! @entity17 described the event in january when the rocket crashed on landing as a ' rapid unscheduled disassembly '			1
@entity0 has been developing technology to land the largest stage of its rocket back on @entity47 he told reporters an hour before the planned launch time that he was grateful to the scientists and others who kept his dream alive			1
the measurements will help measure global warming , he noted , and the steady stream of pictures of @entity47 may help mobilize the public to put pressure on the world 's government leaders ' to take action to save the future of human civilization			0
' ' the constant ability to see the @entity47 whole , fully sunlit , every single day ... can add to our way of thinking about our relationship to the @entity47 , ' said @entity5			0
he was accompanied by sen. @entity100 of @entity30 , who flew on the space shuttle as a congressman in 1986			0
rinse and repeat : @entity0 successfully launched a supply rocket to the @entity106 in january , the sixth mission by the aerospace contractor to the station since 2012			1
the landing was n't as smooth @entity111 marks the spot : a barge floating off the coast of @entity115 , @entity30 , was supposed to recover the leftover booster , but components came down too hard and broke apart , according to @entity0 founder @entity17 the $ 340 million mission is meant to provide a heads - up on intense solar activity that can disrupt communications , power and air travel			1
that 's why the spacecraft is to be stationed 1 million miles from @entity47 and 92 million miles from the sun , the so - called @entity127 where the gravity fields are neutralized			2
@entity58 's director of the @entity130 in @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , likened it to a ' tsunami buoy			0
' the observatory originally was called @entity27 , after the sailor who first spotted land on @entity139 ' historic voyage			0
now it 's dubbed @entity27 , short for @entity27			0
@entity5 's presence added to the excitement at the launch site			2
also contributing to the buzz , though , was the experimental landing planned by @entity0			2
@entity17 wants to eventually reuse his rockets to cut down costs and speed up flights			2
it will be the second such landing test for @entity0			2
last month 's effort ended in flames			2
@entity0 loaded more hydraulic fluid into the first - stage booster this time for the guidance fins ; the fluid ran out too soon on jan. 10 , and the booster landed hard and tumbled over			1
but the path of the unmanned @entity159 rocket this time will see the booster descending faster than before , making it harder to nail the vertical landing			2
@entity0 officials repeatedly stressed that the landing test is a secondary objective , and that the main job is to make sure the observatory gets a good ride to space			1
blasting off : onlookers and photographers watched the trajectory of the @entity159 rocket , which lit up the sky over @entity61 , @entity30 in january ' launching our 1st deep space mission today , ' @entity17 wrote via @entity18			1
he noted that the observatory will end up ' @entity179 further than moon			0
' ' @entity181 will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission , ' he added			0
' almost 2x force and 4x heat			0
plenty of hydraulic fluid tho			0
' the modified barge that will serve as the landing zone nearly 400 miles off the @entity30 coast is almost as big as a football field , but that 's small against the backdrop of the @entity37			0
the 14 - story booster will descend from an altitude of about 80 miles , with touchdown expected nine to 10 minutes after liftoff			2
last month 's effort resulted in minor damage to the platform			1
@entity0 not only patched everything up , but added a name to the platform , painted in large white letters on deck : ' just read the @entity205			1
' that 's the name of a ship from the @entity209 science fiction series written by the late @entity211 author @entity210			0
@entity17 , a @entity214 fan , already has his company delivering cargo to the @entity106 for @entity57 and working on a capsule to fly @entity218 astronauts there .			1

the launch was the company 's second attempt to land a rocket booster
if successful , it could be a step towards affordable space travel
last month , the first attempt to land on the floating platform , the rocket crashed and exploded into a *spectacular* *fireball*
sundays delay gives @entity0 an *opportunity* to fix a first - stage video transmitter , @entity17 said
