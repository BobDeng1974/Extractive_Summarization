by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 6 april 2012 updated : 07:57 est , 10 april 2012 it ’s no yolk - a sculptor has created the world ’s smallest chocolate egg , so tiny it fits on the head of a pin			1
micro sculptor @entity8 spent two weeks carefully crafting the egg , fashioned from real chocolate and wrapped in real gold foil			1
it is so small , the egg is barely visible with the naked eye - and you probably would n’t even taste it if you ate it whole			0
the intricate detail on the egg can only be appreciated by looking through a super-strength microscope			0
@entity22 egg : @entity24 ' creation , the worlds smallest easter egg - so tiny it fits on the head of a pin @entity30 @entity29 spent two weeks crafting his chocolate creation which is too small to see ... and taste the tiny egg is roughly one seventh of the size of a pin head , and sculpted from a tiny portion of a real @entity39 ’s easter egg			1
@entity8 , from @entity40 , struggled to create the amazing piece - after the tiny pieces of chocolate he was using were so small they melted under the bright lights he uses to see his tiny artworks			1
he was forced to resort to crafting a miniscule egg shape from a single grain of sand - before drizzling it with melted chocolate and slowly chipping away using a minute chisel made from a shard of diamond			1
@entity8 , whose sculptures regularly sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds , said : ' working with chocolate was a real challenge for me			1
' it ’s not like any material i ’ve ever used before , and it was so difficult as the heat from the lamp , and even from my fingertips , kept making it melt			0
' i eventually realised the only way i could get the right egg - shape was to sculpt it from sand first , and then cover it in chocolate			2
' i then added a gold left around the bottom of the egg , to give it the appearance of it being unwrapped			0
' i always keep striving to make smaller and smaller sculptures - and i think it ’s safe to say this is the smallest easter egg the world has ever seen			0
' @entity8 ’s incredible sculptures are so intricate that he has even had to learn to slow down his heart rate while creating them - as even the pulse in his thumb is enough to wreck hours of hard work			2
and on more than one occasion , he has even accidentally inhaled some of his priceless creations while putting the final touches to them			2
he added : ' i have to be really careful when making the sculptures - there have been occasions where i ’ve just breathed in and whoosh - all my hard work was gone in a single breath			0
' i had to create a special cage for the egg while i was working on it - with big sides - so if i accidentally blew it away , i would n’t have too far to look for it			0
' @entity8 's other creations include a miniscule @entity105 trophy and this detailed @entity106 one of @entity8 's creations - an astronaut standing in the eye of a needle superhuman skills : you wo n't gain an ounce by munching on @entity8 's chocolate egg this easter @entity8 balanced a tiny @entity116 the 8th and six of his wives within in the eye of a needle			2
