the crisp white powder crunches under foot , stacks of crystalline rock sparkle and ‘ icicles ’ glitter from above			2
no , it ’s not a secluded @entity8 cave but a clinic in @entity10			1
the white powder is n’t snow , it ’s salt			1
so are the icicles and the rocks piled in the corner			2
i am standing in the @entity18 ’s recently - opened ‘ salt grotto ’			1
the grotto ( actually , it ’s less of a ‘ grotto ’ than just a plain old room with assorted sun loungers ) is the brainchild of @entity25 , a psychologist			1
@entity27 grotto ? a sceptical @entity28 chills out in the salt cave in @entity10 she says that such grottos are commonplace in her native @entity31 , and claims that a spell in its salty confines — a typical session lasts an hour and costs £ 25 — offers all manner of health benefits , from relieving asthma to improving blood circulation and lowering blood pressure			1
above all , after an hour in the grotto i should experience , she says , a sense of ‘ psycho physical comfort ’			1
which definitely sounds like a good thing — even if i ’m not entirely sure what she means by it			2
actually , quite a lot of what clinic manager @entity25 says about the health benefits of the salt grotto does n’t bear close scrutiny			1
‘ it ’s about feeling good , mentally and physically , ’ she tells me			2
‘ you will feel calm and refreshed , and you wo n’t have any anxiety			0
’ benefits : @entity57 is rich in minerals such as iodine , potassium and bromide the apparently miraculous power of salt is all , she says , down to its ‘ micro-elements ’			1
@entity57 is rich in minerals such as iodine , potassium and bromide			0
usually , we get these by eating it — but @entity25 believes we can absorb them by sitting in a room full of the stuff			1
‘ we are depleted of micro-elements because our water is polluted , our diet is bad			0
but micro-elements like bromide have a calming effect on the brain			0
if you are stressed out , you can become calm in a natural way			0
’ as well as a new - found sense of calm , after an hour in the grotto , she promises , i should feel reinvigorated and healthy			1
‘ the air is very clean inside the grotto — ten times cleaner than normal air , ’ she continues			1
‘ @entity57 is anti-fungal and anti-bacterial			0
you start breathing slower and deeper as the salt opens up your bronchial airways			1
you breathe better and you feel better			0
’ while it may sound like bunkum ( ok , it definitely does sound like bunkum ) , in @entity96 and @entity97 they have been using salt grottos — both natural and artificial — for donkey ’s years			1
the first was set up 150 years ago after dr @entity100 , a @entity31 physician from @entity101 , near @entity102 , noted that local salt miners did n’t suffer from lung diseases			1
a natural grotto was carved out within the @entity101 mines themselves , 400 feet underground			1
it became popular with those suffering respiratory disease , and is still in use today			0
before i ’m allowed into @entity25 ’s grotto , she hands me a pair of blue plastic shoe covers to protect both the salt and my shoes			1
to keep the salt fresh , it is regularly topped up from the stash of enormous 25kg sacks kept in a storage room at the back			1
and it definitely is salt			1
after @entity25 closes the grotto ’s outer door and leaves me alone , i taste a pinch just to be sure			1
the @entity129 in the corner plays a pan-pipes version of @entity132 , while angled lamps make the salt look rosy pink , with blotches of blue on the ceiling and orange stripes along the walls			2
believer : former psychologist @entity142 says an hour in the salt cave offers all manner of health benefits it ’s a little like being in a @entity148 nightclub			1
nevertheless , after 20 minutes in the cave , the promised sense of calm is indeed descending			0
in fact , i ’m starting to nod off			0
i ’m seated on a squishy sun lounger and wrapped up in a snuggly blanket which @entity25 has provided			1
though there are magazines in the waiting room , in the grotto there ’s nothing to do but drift in and out of sleep			2
clients are asked to leave their mobile phones behind			0
there is a soporific sound of gently trickling water coming from what looks like an enormous garden water feature			0
this , explains @entity25 , is the grotto ’s ‘ evaporation tower ’			1
a good six feet high , it features an artfully - arranged fan of salt - encrusted twigs inside a giant wooden display case			1
water flowing from a tank concealed within the tower ’s wardrobe - like structure is trickling over them			2
it ’s brine , brought over from @entity31 , @entity25 tells me			1
‘ it is one of the most healthy , healing waters , ’ she says			0
it is a very special mineral water			0
sitting near it as it flows , many of your positive ions will change to negative ions , which always make you feel better			0
‘ in the city , there are a lot of positive ions — which make you feel anxious , angry and agitated			0
@entity198 : though there are magazines in the waiting room , in the grotto there ¿ s nothing to do but drift in and out of sleep negative ions make you feel refreshed and fantastic			2
’ from what i can remember of gcse physics , ions are simply atoms or molecules with positive or negative electrical charges			0
why they should leave you anxious or refreshed eludes me			0
the twigs , meanwhile , are birch — a ‘ healing wood ’ according to @entity25			1
but of course ! the salt itself is equally exotic			2
the three tons which cover the floor have been brought from @entity31 , while the rocks lining the walls and piled at the corners are @entity227 salt imported from @entity228			1
according to @entity25 : ‘ not every salt has all the special properties			1
@entity227 salt has 84 different micro-elements			2
’ in total , the room contains more than 10 tons of salt			2
building it took a month and cost £ 35,000			0
there ’s no doubt that lolling around in my sun lounger is a rather pleasant way to while away an hour — but how does the scientific evidence stack up ? unfortunately , there is n’t a huge amount			0
‘ i know of no good scientific evidence about this approach and see no reason why this should be any better than relaxing in any other quiet environment , ’ says professor @entity246 , a physician and former professor of complementary medicine at @entity248			0
@entity254 , of @entity255 made @entity256 , an independent organisation aimed at explaining scientific research to the public , agrees — and questions the idea that exposure to ‘ micro-particles ’ and ‘ negative ions ’ can make you feel calmer and more energised			0
she says : ‘ there ’s no reason at all you should feel calm because of exposure to negative ions			0
and there have been no studies that have shown mineral water will convert positive ions to negative ones			0
’ neither is there much to support the myriad other health benefits salt grottos purport to offer			1
@entity278 , research officer at @entity279 , says that while some sufferers have noticed short - term benefits , it is not clear whether that ’s down to salt or simply the effect of an hour ’s relaxation			1
a couple of months ago a similar business , the @entity286 — a company which operates a chain of grottos across the @entity279 — was forced to remove a section of its website which claimed salt therapy could treat various ailments , including cystic fibrosis and psoriasis			2
the @entity297 concluded that there was insufficient evidence			0
inconclusive : unfortunately there is n't much scientific evidence to support the supposed health benefits of using a salt cave @entity25 is unperturbed by such naysayers			1
‘ there ’s always a war between traditional doctors and alternative therapies , ’ she says			0
‘ the medical world is like a @entity310			0
you ca n’t patent a natural thing like this , so there ’s no money in it for them			0
’ and anyway , she says , business is booming			0
though the clinic is ghostly quiet during my time there , @entity25 claims her grotto often has 30 customers a day			1
clients hoping to treat their asthma are recommended to make two or three visits a week for seven or eight weeks — at a cost of more than £ 400			2
it sounds an awful lot to realign your ions , if you ask me			0
you can even hire the grotto for private parties — complete with champagne and canapés in the clinic ’s sleek white reception area			2
the next marketing opportunity is a new wrinkle cream made with hemp oil and ( yes , you guessed it ) himalayan salt			2
@entity25 says : ‘ @entity57 keeps moisture in the skin and smooths it out			1
look , i ’m 62 , but i do n’t have many wrinkles			0
’ ( it is true that she does look some ten years younger than her age			0
) as for me ? well , i ca n’t say i experience any great transformation			0
@entity25 tells me i should sleep deeply that night , and certainly i leave the clinic feeling relaxed			1
but whether that ’s the salt at work or has more to do with the fact that i ’ve spent an hour snoozing on a sun lounger , i do n’t know			2
at any rate , it was a perfectly pleasant — if expensive — way to spend a morning			0
as for any supposed health benefits			1
well , i ’d take those with a pinch of salt .			2

@entity18 is a recently - opened ' salt grotto ' in @entity10
@entity31 manager @entity25 says it offers all manner of health benefits
claims it can relieve asthma , improve circulation and lower blood pressure
