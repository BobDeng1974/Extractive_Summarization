@entity0 and @entity1 both dipped into the transfer market to boost their chances of winning the @entity5 tv battle this summer , with @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 signing short - term deals to appear as part of their coverage			1
@entity13 , @entity14 ’s top @entity5 goalscorer and long - time @entity0 pundit , tweeted a picture of @entity0 's ' team ' for their first live matches , @entity19 against @entity20 on friday and @entity14 versus @entity21 on saturday			2
' half decent , i 'd say , ' was @entity24 's verdict - and he 's not wrong			0
@entity6 , @entity25 and @entity26 joined @entity24 for the selfie , and with @entity7 waiting in the wings for future games the @entity0 have the makings of quite a five - a - side team over in @entity32			1
video scroll don to watch @entity0 pundits @entity13 and @entity25 team @entity0 : @entity6 , @entity25 , @entity13 and @entity26 in @entity32 on wednesday all - star selfie ( apart from the bloke at the back ) : ( left - right ) @entity36 , @entity39 , @entity8 , @entity40 and @entity41 posed for this picture by the former @entity21 captain and @entity5 - winning defender hours after @entity24 ’s tweet , @entity8 also posted a picture from @entity47			1
the former @entity51 winner was joined by @entity36 , @entity39 and @entity40 , the latter of whom will be joining him as part of @entity1 ’s @entity5 team			0
which begs the question – who would win in a five - a - side game between the two channels ? @entity0 @entity6 – 123 caps , 51 goals @entity7 – 87 caps , 21 goals @entity25 – 81 caps , 3 goals @entity13 – 80 caps , 48 goals @entity26 – 63 caps , 30 goals total – 434 caps , 153 goals @entity1 @entity8 – 136 caps , 2 goals @entity40 – 107 caps , 6 goals @entity75 – 53 caps , 8 goals @entity78 – 33 caps , 9 goals @entity81 – 26 caps , 3 goals total – 355 caps , 28 goals neither have an established goalkeeper in their tv coverage squad , so both will be playing ' spider ' keepers , where any player on the pitch can swap and go between the sticks			1
there is no doubt @entity1 will miss @entity97 in midfield – the tantalising prospect of him lining up alongside @entity40 snatched away from viewers when the @entity101 decided to pursue the assistant manager 's job at @entity104			0
@entity105 must be worried about where his side ’s goals are going to come from too , with @entity1 ’s team scoring just 28 goals between them during their international careers , a figure dwarfed by @entity0 ’s tally of 153			0
defensively , however , @entity1 definitely have the upper hand			0
@entity8 and @entity40 , @entity5 winners with @entity21 and @entity116 respectively , would be formidable in a five - a - side set - up , while @entity75 and @entity81 would be comfortable keeping possession in midfield			2
verdict – despite @entity1 ’s defensive pedigree it is hard to imagine anything other than a high - scoring @entity0 victory			0
glory days : @entity6 celebrates @entity116 's victory against @entity19 at the 2006 @entity5 on top of the world : @entity8 hoists the trophy above his head after @entity21 's victory in the final in 2006 the line - ups : the @entity1 team ( left ) and the @entity0 team ( right ) could play on the beach in @entity32			1

@entity0 team *includes* @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity25 , @entity13 and @entity26
@entity1 team features @entity8 , @entity40 , @entity75 , @entity78 and @entity81
@entity141 kicks off on *thursday* night
