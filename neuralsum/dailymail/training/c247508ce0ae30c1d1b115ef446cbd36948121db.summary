20th century beauty secrets : to enhance their appearance , women in 1907 were advised to cry and wear pearls today women have a plethora of cosmetics at their fingers tips to help their eyes appear wider and brighter			1
but a delve into the @entity11 archives has revealed that more than 100 years ago , those who wanted to enhance their appearance had to reply on more basic methods			1
a column called ' @entity14 ' published in the newspaper in march 1907 advises women to have a good old cry if they want to look good - as long as it 's kept short			1
the article states : ' crying will make the eyes brighter provided it is not indulged in for too long			1
a brisk little cry clears out the tear ducts and makes the eyes clearer , but much of it will take away the brilliancy again			1
' in another surprising tip , they warn : ' the woman facing a bright light while she sews or reads will soon have her eyes of no colour at all			1
' the column has other advice for women dependent on their hair and eye colour			1
for women with brown eyes , it 's recommended they wear ' brown round her neck and under her chin ' to enhance the colour			1
it adds : ' the brown - eyed woman should dress her hair rather fluffily			0
she must not wear it plain , and should bring it down well upon her forehead			0
' women with blonde hair and brown eyes are in luck as the article states they will look ' charming no matter how she arranges her hair , provided of course that is is well coiffe			1
it is as well for her to mass her hair high above her forehead so that it will make an aureole for her face			0
' but the writer laments : ' it is the woman with dull or fishy eyes who is at a loss how to proceed because her eyes lack colour			1
' scrubbing up well : pale - eyed girls were advised to ' treat her eyebrows every night with a good eyebrow grower ' and bath their eye lashes with a little boracic acid in water for such women , they offer the following advice : ' do not make " play " with your eyes			2
it is the pale - eyed girl who loves to cast her eyes upwards looking at nothing at all			2
it is the girl with the pale blue eyes who rolls them and strikes attitudes			2
' but be it remembered that while the black - eyed girl may attempt such " play " the pale - eyed one never should do so			0
' they recommend that the ' pale - eyed girl should treat her eyebrows every night with a good eyebrow grower in the form of a little almond oil and vaseline mixed half and half			0
in the morning , the eyebrows should be brushed with a little soft bay toothbrush			0
' meanwhile , they also advise bathing eye lashes with warm water with a hint of boracic acid dissolved in it			0
last resort : pale eyed girls could always wear a hat but should n't make ' play ' with their eyes in order to look more attractive this eye wash is often only used in the modern day to treat the symptoms of conjunctivitis but back in 1907 , it was said to keep eye lashes ' well and strong '			2
if all else fails for the ' pale - eyed girl ' then the 20th century beauty columnist recommends she ' wears a hat that tips forward over her face so that the brim may shade her eyes '			2
when it comes to accessorising , in 1907 diamonds were not a girls ' best friend			0
instead , pearls were more in fashion according to the beauty column as they are ' softer and vastly more welcoming than diamonds '			0
under a sub heading ' crimes against beauty ' the writer warns about the causes of premature ageing , some of which remain in vogue today			0
for example , they state that ' the woman who looks intently at things will soon develop a wrinkle between the eyes ' and sleeping with the face in the pillow can lead to ' waking up with a thousand wrinkles '			0
@entity152 may have changed but beauty writers today still advise against squinting as it can cause lines around the eyes and recommend a silk or satin pillow to prevent wrinkles .			2

column called ' @entity14 ' published in @entity11 march 1907
states crying makes the eyes brighter provided ' not indulged in for too long '
also warns women against looking at bright lights to prevent colour *fading*
