by @entity0 @entity1 was a late withdrawal , but in his absence his young pretender , @entity3 , sprinted to an easy victory against a world class field in @entity7 on thursday night			1
@entity3 is the double gold medallist from the @entity9 in @entity10 who trains with @entity1 under @entity12 , and he was bolt-esque as he unfolded his tall body and then eased up to cross the line in 9.96 , the only man under 10 seconds			1
@entity17 ’s @entity16 100m champion @entity15 was third in 10.06 while the 200m champion , @entity18 , was fifth in 10.13			1
it was a better night for @entity17 ’s women ’s sprinters who won the 4x100m relay ahead of a strong @entity25 quartet			1
‘ it ’s amazing , ’ said @entity45			0
‘ we just wanted to run well again			1
the crowd was amazing , the girls are amazing			0
’ @entity50 , who ran the anchor leg , said ; ‘ i just looked to my left and right and thought , oh my @entity52 , these are the quickest girls in the world , but you know what , i consider myself one of them and i knew that these girls would do a fantastic job to put me in a good position			2
i ’m so glad that we were able to get the baton around smoothly			0
’ withdrawal : @entity1 was pictured out on the town in @entity63 during the week @entity15 was merely content with his performance in the men ’s 100m , running from lane one			1
‘ i felt pretty good , and i ’ve still got a few races left so hopefully i ’ll be able to improve			0
i ’m 100 percent fit , ’ said the injury - prone @entity15			2
@entity18 , who confirmed afterwards that this would be his final race of 2014 , said : ‘ i did n’t realise until i took my first stride , it was hard			2
coming off the back of two championships i had done a lot of work			0
but to finish fifth ahead of @entity77 , who ’s run under 10 seconds this year , is good			1
’ earlier , @entity78 , the @entity16 400 metres champion , faced @entity79 and could only manage 45.10 for fourth , with @entity79 winning in 44.36			0
flying the flag : ( @entity81 ) @entity36 , @entity82 , @entity33 and @entity35 won the women 's 4x100m ‘ that was poor , ’ said @entity84			1
‘ i ’m really disappointed with that			0
you need to challenge but if you give @entity89 five metres it ’s very hard to chase him down			0
i ’ve had two championships , one better than the other , but these opportunities do n’t come everyday			0
