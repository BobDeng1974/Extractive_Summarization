by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 07:02 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 19:06 est , 25 april 2013 @entity3 yesterday killed the controversial ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’ live on local radio			2
the deputy prime minister triggered a bitter new @entity9 split as he ripped up £ 400million of @entity11 work by saying the plan to allow police and the security services to monitor the public ’s emails and internet visits was ‘ not going to happen ’			1
officials believed they had a commitment from mr @entity3 that the @entity20 would support the legislation being included in the upcoming @entity22			1
@entity3 , on a visit to @entity24 in @entity25 with police today , said he would not back reworked @entity11 plans to track data the deputy prime minister said he had spoken to senior police officers and the security services about why he was opposed to a vast database tracking all online activity last month , the @entity11 ’s top counter-terrorism official , @entity33 , said there was ‘ cross-governmental approval ’ for the plan			1
mr @entity3 ’s remarks were welcomed by civil liberties groups , which have fought a dogged campaign against the ‘ @entity41 ’ proposal			1
but the dropping of the plans will alarm the security services , police and child protection experts			2
@entity47 , the @entity48 , has said changing the law was a ‘ matter of life and death ’			2
supporters claim that , without the new laws , paedophiles , organised criminals and terrorists will escape detection			2
there was astonishment in @entity61 that mr @entity3 had chosen the platform of his weekly phone - in on @entity25 ’s @entity65 radio station to make such a major announcement			2
the @entity20 leader 's comments were welcomed by civil liberties campaigners , but @entity70 insisted discussions were ongoing mr @entity3 was joined on the visit to @entity73 by @entity20 home office minister @entity74 ( centre ) mr @entity3 , who met local residents on the @entity24 , said he wanted to protect people from unnecessary intrusion the @entity79 was a central plank of the government ’s counter-terrorism strategy , and home secretary @entity83 had been determined to see it become law			1
in recent weeks , the @entity11 had offered a string of concessions to mr @entity3 , who was under strong pressure from his own mps to veto the legislation			2
mrs may accepted every recommendation made by a joint committee of @entity93 , set up at mr @entity3 ’s request , to water down the original plan , and @entity11 ministers and officials were convinced they had mr @entity3 ’s backing			0
but on wednesday – only a few hours before mr @entity3 went on the radio – the prime minister was told he was pulling the plug on the negotiations			1
officials say it is the second time mr @entity3 has changed his position on supporting the @entity106			0
it came amid @entity9 tensions over whether to withdraw temporarily from the @entity109 to improve the chances of booting out @entity111			0
yesterday , @entity112 and peers were delighted at the death of plans , which would have led to the storage of details of the public ’s email , website visits and use of @entity122 and social media			1
police and security officials would have been able to ask internet companies to provide details of who a person was contacting – but not the content			1
home secretary @entity83 had hoped to reach a compromise deal so that legislation could be included in the @entity22 on may 8 @entity133 , the president of the @entity20 , tweeted : ‘ we have killed the @entity135 – campaigning together we have stopped this			1
standing up for civil liberties and freedom of speech			1
’ tory backbenchers were also happy			0
@entity140 said : ‘ this orwellian scheme should be buried for good			0
for the billions it would cost , there are far better ways to strengthen law enforcement without snooping on every law - abiding citizen			0
’ mr @entity3 broke the news shortly after 9am on his weekly phone - in			0
he said : ‘ the idea was that the government would pass a law which means there would be a record kept of every website you visit , who you communicate with on social media sites			1
‘ that is not going to happen			0
it is certainly not going to happen with @entity20 in @entity150			0
’ mr @entity3 said he did not believe the @entity161 public would support the hoarding of huge amount of information about individuals ’ internet use in a ‘ treasure trove of data which you can then dip into if you need to ’			2
further work is expected on how new legislation might be introduced to deal with the limited problem faced by the police in matching internet addresses with individual mobile phones or computers			1
the prime minister ’s official spokesman would not be drawn on whether legislation in this area would feature in the @entity22			1
sources close to mr @entity3 said it was ‘ rubbish ’ to suggest he had supported the @entity106			0
they said the announcement had been made on @entity65 because he was asked a question on the subject			0
few tears will be shed for the ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’ outside of @entity61			0
from the moment the idea was suggested by @entity191 , it has been condemned as an orwellian assault on civil liberties			1
ministers tried desperately to refine the proposals to make them acceptable to a deeply sceptical public			2
for example , @entity83 ditched @entity191 ’s idea of storing communications data on a giant central government database – saying it would be left to individual internet service providers to keep the information			1
but despite all the forceful efforts by senior police and the government to sell the idea , the case was never successfully made for having the power to spy on the public ’s every internet click and @entity212 visit			1
however , while millions will welcome the death of the legislation , there is good reason to be alarmed about how the decision was reached			0
last month , the @entity11 believed it had a cast - iron guarantee from @entity3 that the @entity106 would be included in the forthcoming @entity22			2
@entity33 , the @entity11 ’s most senior counter-terrorism official , stated publicly that the proposal had ‘ cross-governmental approval ’			0
yet , on wednesday , mr @entity3 – whose aides insist he never backed the legislation – announced to the prime minister that he was blocking the @entity106			1
he then used the platform of his weekly radio show on @entity65 , of all places , to announce what amounts to a fundamental shift in government policy on national security			0
never mind the fact that local radio is no place to reveal that talks have broken down over how to keep the country safe			0
what is most worrying is that the government is so dysfunctional that its two halves can not even agree on whether mr @entity3 ever supported the idea in the first place			0
yesterday may have been a good day for civil liberties			1
but it was another shambles for the pantomime - horse coalition .			0
