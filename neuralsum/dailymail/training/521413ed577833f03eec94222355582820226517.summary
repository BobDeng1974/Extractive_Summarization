by @entity0 published : 19:28 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 21:05 est , 27 march 2013 considering the strength of feelings still against him , you might expect any day now to see the remains of the @entity8 rail chief , dr @entity7 , disinterred and dragged in shame round the streets of @entity11			1
for in popular legend , dr @entity7 is synonymous with the mass destruction of @entity16 ’s rail network			1
mere mention of his name triggers images of a mad axeman			0
last saturday marked the 50th anniversary of the publication of his famous report , reshaping the @entity25 , which led to a massive programme of track and station closures			1
this lust to blame him for everything that is still wrong with our railways seems unquenchable			0
it is 50 years since dr @entity7 published his report but his legacy should be of saving the railways , according @entity38 , the @entity39 's former industrial editor @entity7 ( right ) chairman of the @entity41 at @entity42 for example , the much - loved former @entity44 star and tv travel presenter @entity43 says @entity7 left ‘ a psychological and environmental scar unmatched by the scaling down of any other industry ’			1
the writer @entity49 argues that @entity7 must carry the can for putting the knife to 24,000 miles of track linking the rural communities to our towns and cities			1
even at the time , the @entity58 cabinet minister @entity57 said : ‘ @entity7 is hardly a winsome personality			1
he makes every cut in a local service look like a piece of deliberate cruelty and any closure like an act of class war			2
’ yet i knew @entity7 well while working as the @entity39 ’s industrial editor			1
his image as a penny - pinching accountant with no understanding of this country ’s rich railway heritage or of the needs of the travelling public could not be further from the truth			1
i can honestly say that the portrait of him as a cruel , number - fixated bureaucrat is an absurd caricature			2
true , his report identified 2,363 stations — one - third of those in the network — and around 6,000 miles of track to be closed			1
not surprisingly , his proposal sparked outrage from commuters , local councils and the trade unions , who were appalled at the talk of 70,000 job losses			0
there was particular anger in some major towns , such as @entity94 , where people feared they might be left without any rail link			0
yet the truth is that @entity7 was a courageous man who forced the railways to face up to commercial realities			1
contrary to what his critics pretend today , @entity16 ’s railways were in a desperate mess			1
a modernisation plan had been introduced a few years earlier to reduce losses but had made little impact			2
by 1961 , when @entity7 launched his commission , the network was losing £ 140 million a year — a staggering sum for that period			2
battles between management and the unions were rife , and led to a rail strike in 1955 which lasted 17 days and so badly paralysed the country that the government had to call a state of emergency			2
as chairman of the @entity41 , @entity7 bravely challenged this culture of waste and saw it as his duty to drag the railway industry into the modern world			1
the truth is that whoever had been in charge of the railways , some sort of cuts would have been necessary			0
much of the equipment dated back to @entity132 times , as did many working practices			0
the @entity134 - the @entity134 - has been criticised for 50 years @entity7 ’s report set out in stark terms how nearly half of the nation ’s 7,000 railway stations generated only 2 per cent of the total rail traffic , while one - third of the entire track carried just one per cent of the traffic			1
two - thirds of the rolling stock was not used all the year round			0
one extreme example of this under - use highlighted by @entity7 was in @entity146 , where the line between @entity148 and @entity149 carried an average of only nine passengers on five trains a day			1
the income from these journeys covered barely ten per cent of the route ’s costs			0
the railways were not just highly inefficient , but they were also facing serious competition from cars and lorries using new roads			0
petrol was cheap and as the country emerged from the period of shortages during @entity167 , more people found they could afford a car			0
increasingly this was the most popular form of travel , rather than families having to wait in dismal stations to sit on cold trains			0
in 1938 , there were 1.9 million privately owned cars in @entity16 , but the figure rose to more than six million by the time @entity7 became rail chairman in 1961			1
under the recommendations rural statiosn such as @entity179 , pictured , were closed down @entity7 's legacy should be as a ' courageous ' man who faced up to the unions , writes mr @entity38 the @entity184 had just been built in 1959 and rail freight was severely undercut by the new road haulage industry			1
@entity7 had the guts to devise a coherent , workable scheme to rationalise the country ’s railway system			1
as he himself put it rather wistfully : ‘ i suppose i will always be remembered as the axeman , but it was surgery , not mad chopping			0
’ born in @entity198 , @entity199 , in 1913 , @entity7 went on to gain a first - class honours degree in physics from @entity202 in @entity11 and got a phd for his research into electrons			1
after working with armaments at the @entity207 during the war , he embarked on a highly successful career with the chemical giant @entity210			0
his talent for management , allied to his analytical skills , brought him to the attention of the government , and in 1961 the conservative transport minister @entity216 persuaded him to become chairman of the @entity41			0
immediately , @entity7 was plunged into controversy — insisting he ought to be paid the same level of salary he had received at @entity210 , which was £ 24,000 ( the equivalent of about £ 390,000 today )			2
this was two - and - a - half times the salary of any chief of any other national industry , and 35 times the pay of the average railway worker			2
it should be remembered , however , that in those days of soaring income tax , the state took a massive proportion of high earners ’ pay			0
in fact , @entity7 told me that when he was hired for any speaking engagement , he usually asked for a box of good @entity239 cigars instead of a fee because the exorbitant level of tax meant it was hardly worthwhile being paid			1
as railway chairman , he set to work			0
he ended all the excessive duplication and waste , which were a legacy of the network ’s @entity132 creation , and concentrated efforts on its core trunk routes , running trains at higher speeds between the main urban centres			0
@entity38 says dr @entity7 forced the industry out of the steam age the under - used rural lines , sidings and goods yards were indulgences that could no longer be afforded			1
indeed , in some areas there was little for rural station workers to do on these routes apart from signalmen occasionally lugging at a lever to let an empty train go through — and then return to do a spot of gardening around their station box			0
@entity7 was a visionary as well as a rationalist			2
his most important contribution to revolutionising @entity16 ’s transport system was how he predicted that , in the future , goods were going to be moved round the world as freight , in huge boxes , and that @entity16 risked being left behind by its foreign rivals			2
the country was not going to need 30,000 dockers in @entity11 ’s @entity283 , 10,000 in @entity284 , @entity285 , and 7,000 in @entity286			0
the work would be centred on massive ports such as @entity289 , @entity290 , where huge containers could be moved by cranes rather than by men			0
the same applied to the docks in @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297			0
the historic @entity298 ran its first steam - train this month on the reclaimed line from @entity301 to @entity302 after it was closed in march 1958 as part of the @entity134 so @entity7 created new freightliner rolling stock and a new infrastructure of depots around the country to meet this demand			1
sadly , the @entity309 undermined the effectiveness of the new freightliners by insisting , as a job retention measure , that there must be a guard at the rear of every train			0
journalists such as me pleaded with @entity319 , the long - serving @entity309 general secretary , but he could not move his men to accept what @entity7 had proposed			1
clearly , @entity7 had picked up a poisoned chalice , but he did not flinch from his task			2
he also cut layers of management , shook up a deeply engrained culture of set procedures and practices , some of which dated from the beginning of steam , and challenged the rail industry ’s tendency to warn that any change would endanger safety			0
of course , @entity7 was a convenient lightning rod to deflect unpopularity away from the politicians			2
however , for all the blame heaped on him , he did not take the actual decisions on line closures			0
that was done by transport ministers in the @entity346 and @entity345 of the @entity8			0
the iconic train was back up and running 50 years on from dr @entity7 's report indeed , @entity58 ’s @entity350 cleverly exploited public discontent with @entity7 in the run - up to the 1964 general election , but then when elected he did nothing to reverse the cuts and even pushed ahead with some closures that @entity7 had never recommended			1
but @entity350 ’s transport secretary @entity357 forced @entity7 out of his job in 1965			2
in fact , i organised his farewell lunch on his last day in the role at his favourite haunt , the then magnificent @entity364 ( now a soul-less @entity365 ) in @entity42 , @entity11			0
it was there , in a secret room in the hotel , that he finally won agreement with the rail unions to face up to his modernisation programme			1
what @entity7 ’s critics so often ignore is that in the long - term his cost - cutting was a success			1
in contrast to most other parts of the western world , @entity16 ’s railways are now flourishing			2
in recent decades , the network has enjoyed a phenomenal renaissance , with passenger numbers now at their highest levels since the @entity385			0
yes , there are plenty of problems such as overcrowding , but at least there is new investment going into the railways			0
so i say ‘ hats off ’ to @entity7			2
@entity16 management could have used many more like him in the @entity8 to tackle the nation ’s industrial decline and to create real jobs			1
come to think of it , if pioneers like @entity7 had met with more success , we might not be in the economic mess we are today .			1

the @entity39 's former industrial editor @entity38 knew @entity7
@entity7 made the rail unions face up to modernisation programme
@entity7 's critics ignore fact that cost - cutting was success in long - term
@entity7 's report recommended the closure of about 6,000 miles of track
he historically been blamed for mass destruction of @entity16 's railway
