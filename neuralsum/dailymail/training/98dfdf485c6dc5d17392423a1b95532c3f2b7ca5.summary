by @entity0 there was a home winner on the eighth stage of the @entity4 while @entity5 remains in the yellow jersey after a thrilling battle with @entity8			1
@entity9 dragged himself over the line , rain soaked , after a 161km ride from @entity13 to @entity14 , his victory itself a story as he went solo after being part of a breakaway that had featured gutsy @entity21 @entity20			1
but as @entity22 crossed the line , @entity5 had to dig as deep as he could to stay with @entity8 who , with a kilometre or so to go tried to drop the @entity25 rider			1
home win : @entity28 rider @entity9 took the eighth stage of the @entity4 , a 100 mile route between @entity13 and @entity31 high climber : his stage victory also meant @entity9 claimed the polka dot jersey for best climber break away : @entity9 , of the @entity37 team , surged clear of his competitors over the twin uphill climbs at the end of the route to claim victory in wet conditions still on top : @entity46 rider @entity45 did enough to keep hold of the yellow jersey all he saw was a magnificent response from @entity5 who went with him and lost just three seconds of his overall lead to the @entity52 , but increased it to a minute and 44 seconds over second - placed team - mate @entity53			1
@entity8 is two minutes and 34 seconds down in sixth , while away from the scrap between he and @entity5 , @entity55 's new leader @entity54 moved up to third overall , although he has lost four more seconds to @entity5 , trailing by a minute and 58 seconds			1
for so long it had looked as though @entity60 's @entity59 would be in the mix at the end , sticking with the breakaway he joined 35 kilometres in until they approached the gruelling climax of the first of three successive days in the @entity68			1
gaining time : @entity8 ( left ) puts in a late attack to gain seconds on race leader @entity5 ( right ) rural idyll : a farmer sits on his tractor to watch the peloton go past here they come : the riders bunched in a pack as they cover the 161km eighth stage that started in @entity13 , near @entity79 , north - eastern @entity28 the final 30 kilometres saw the category climbs of the @entity82 des @entity81 and the @entity83 , while the steep finish at @entity14 did its best to separate the challengers from the rest			1
@entity20 battled gamely but was duly eaten up by the peloton , with @entity8 , @entity88 and @entity89 emerging as the big three as the @entity4 reaches its one - week mark			1
the big loser was @entity92 who crashed on the ride down the @entity83 , losing over two minutes on his yellow jersey rivals			1
picnic : spectators watch the race while enjoying some refreshments scenic ? : the breakaway group passes the @entity101 in the town of @entity103 on their way to @entity105 picturesque : the pack of riders cross a canal in @entity110 on the eighth stage it was a positive day for @entity54 , who is adapting to the role of @entity55 's main man after defending champion @entity115 had to abandon injured			1
speaking to @entity117 , he said : ' i 'm happy with how that went , it is not really my bread and butter and i think that on the longer climbs i will be better			0
' he acknowledged that the aggressive riding of @entity8 's team had changed the landscape , though			1
' @entity128 are riding very aggressively from a long way out , a bit like @entity55 used to do , ' he said			0
