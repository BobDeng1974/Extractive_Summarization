@entity0 has revealed he would relish a fight against @entity2 in the @entity3 , following the latter 's @entity5 welterweight world title triumph on saturday night			1
unbeaten fighter @entity2 beat deposed champion @entity7 by a majority decision in @entity9 - with the judges scoring the bout 117 - 111 and 116 - 112 in his favour while the other official classed it as a draw on 114 - 114 points apiece			1
the @entity18 boxer 's success in @entity19 has led to speculation that a domestic super-fight with @entity0 could next be on the cards for the pair			0
' i think it definitely can happen , we 'll just leave it to the teams now to negotiate and talk about what 's going to happen , ' @entity0 told @entity46 when asked if he would fight @entity2			1
' i 'm contracted to @entity47 and @entity48 , who 's my advisor , so i 'm just going to let them takeover and if the fight can happen - let 's make it			0
' i 'm up for it and it 's definitely a fight the @entity3 crowd would want to see			0
bigger goals : @entity2 ( left ) said @entity0 ' can get in the queue to fight ' him after defeating @entity7 class above : @entity0 ( left ) won his last bout against @entity62 ( right ) in may ' having the fight in the @entity3 would be amazing			1
i 'd like it somewhere such as @entity26 which i think would be a quick sell out			0
' it 's a fight that would have the @entity3 fans excited , it 's something they 've been talking about for a long time and i always said @entity2 would have to prove himself first before he can fight me			2
' now he 's done that by beating @entity7 and winning a world title , but then you ca n't disrespect me because i 've been on the world title stage for a long time and he has to remember that			1
' he 's an all - around good fighter , but the way to beat @entity2 is to be in control , push him back , make him think and hit the angles			0
weaknesses : @entity0 believes @entity2 's ( left ) body is a weak spot of the @entity18 fighter ' i think he has a weak body as well , at times he got caught with a shot and he was hurt			1
he 's a big puncher but by making him move you can catch him then and he ca n't sit on his punches			0
after his victory against @entity7 , @entity2 said @entity0 ' can get in the queue ' as the 28 - year - old lines up mega fights against the ilk of @entity91			1
the pound - for - pound king @entity91 has long been a potential opponent of @entity0 's and the @entity94 boxer believes @entity2 has to get past him first before dreaming at a shot against the 37 - year - old			2
' if he thinks about what he 's said , i 've been in eight world title fights winning two world titles as well unifying world titles			2
this is only his first world title so he 's got a long way to go yet before he can get past me , ' @entity0 added			1
too good : @entity91 ( left ) is widely regarded as the pound - for - pound boxing king ' i 've had one fight at this weight division and now we 're at the same weight - our fight can happen			0
' @entity2 has to have a couple of more big fights before he can think about that			0
' he 's only just got his one world title and i 'm sure he 'll want to defend it a few times before having a super-fight with the likes of myself , @entity91 or [ @entity118 ] @entity117			2
' @entity119 will tell but i 'm sure we 'll discuss a bout			0

@entity0 says a @entity3 super-fight with @entity2 can definitely happen
@entity2 beat @entity7 on saturday to win @entity5 welterweight world title
@entity0 believes fighting *brook* at @entity26 would be a ' sell out '
