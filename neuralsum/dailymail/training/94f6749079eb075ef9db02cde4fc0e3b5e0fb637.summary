‘ i ’m sure that ’s true of most people who train as therapists , ’ she told @entity51			2
cider with @entity6 evokes a long - lost , rural @entity55 that was on the cusp of being overwhelmed by the modern age			2

' @entity90 was the way forward for me to try to make sense of my background , to understand the world differently			0
’ she added : ‘ i did some interesting work on only children as a therapist			0
' people talk about sibling rivalry but very little has been done about the only child , except to say they tend to grow up much more quickly because they often have to be the mediator between both parents			0
‘ i often felt like i was looking after both parents			0
@entity8 did n’t want me to grow up , either			1
he wanted to keep me where he could control me			0
i think there ’s no secret there			0
