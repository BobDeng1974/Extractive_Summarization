social networks are increasingly being linked with addiction and mental illness , and now a new study claims @entity4 could even bring on episodes of psychosis			1
in the study , researchers from @entity8 presented the case of a 31 - year - old woman who had been hospitalised after developing delusions , which were linked to her ‘ excessive ’ use of @entity4			1
after studying how the social network influenced the patient ’s perception , the researchers proposed social media has the potential to ‘ aggravate or even induce psychotic symptoms ’			1
however , they were quick to note that @entity4 , and social media in general , only has this effect on particularly vulnerable patients who are already predisposed to psychosis			1
they proposed social media has the potential to ‘ to induce psychotic symptoms ’ - but only with vulnerable people already predisposed to psychosis lead researcher , dr @entity37 , physician at @entity38 , told @entity40 that this study was published to raise the issue , and refers to an individual case study			1
he continued that he 's seen very few cases over the past years , and added : ' at this point you should not be worried about @entity4 psychosis as a normal user			1
' in may , researchers from @entity50 similarly linked psychotic episodes in patients to internet addiction			0
these were blamed on delusions caused by virtual relationships cultivated on social networking sites			2
although all the participants had underlying problems of loneliness , none had any history of psychosis or drug abuse , the team said			2
lead researcher doctor @entity65 of @entity50 's @entity66 and the @entity67 said : ' as internet access becomes increasingly widespread , so do related psychopathologies			0
' computer communications such as @entity71 and chat groups are an important part of this story			0
' the woman referenced in the study was a 31 - year - old dubbed ' mrs c '			0
she was hospitalised for intensive suicidal thoughts and compulsions , but had no previous history of psychiatric illness			1
the symptoms began approximately eight months before she was hospitalised , and four months in , mrs c ’s family reported she was using @entity4 ‘ excessively			1
’ this was defined as ‘ several hours a day ’ and led to her ‘ neglecting relationships , meals and sleeping hours			1
’ she started suffering from delusions that a celebrity was talking to her , through hidden and symbolic messages in tweets - and that she had to react to these so - called ‘ tasks ’ the celebrity was giving her			1
this symbols then began appearing in her offline world and she reported paranoid delusions that a sect , or organisation , were behind the tasks			1
dr @entity37 continued : ' the main problems at @entity4 are the spam bots and the abbreviations			2
' due to the structure of @entity4 , it is quite easy to program spam bots for it , and the use of abbreviations is promoted by the limitation to 140 characters			2
' furthermore , people on @entity4 can have the impression that they are personally addressed because the spam bots get more active if they get more active			2
' and , although we have no formal proof for that , we had the impression that the spam bots sometimes send tweets with confusing abbreviations in order to create curiosity to follow a link			0
' or in the case of our patients cause or add to the development of psychiatric symptoms			1
' the researchers linked their findings to the combination of ' the amount of symbolic language , caused by the limitation of 140 characters per @entity4 message , the automated spam responses with seemingly related content , and the general interactive features of @entity4 ' ‘ we wanted to spark a discussion about what @entity4 does to our minds and chose a provocative title to bring this subject up			1
’ ' if you sit in front of your computer now and feel unsure what to think , call someone you trust , go and have a coffee together and talk about your feelings , ' said dr @entity37			0
' if you realise while talking about it , that it makes you feel uncomfortable , you might want to cut down on your internet use , then try to cut down			0
' if you ca n’t cut down on it , even though you want to , or if you realise you experience things that sound odd to other people , you should consider speaking to someone professional			0
' but in many cases you will just realise you are not different than other people			0
' the article was published in the @entity164			0
when asked if his team would be carrying out any follow - up research , dr @entity37 said : ' definitely			0
the fact that a single case study caused such a world - wide attention is a clear indicator that we know way too little about the effect of social media on mental health			2
' however , researchers from the @entity177 recently claimed social networks can help support people with mental illnesses , because they give people the opportunity to meet and connect with others going through the same thing			0
‘ through sharing pictures , videos and stories about their families ’ highs and lows support group members are able to get to know each other better and form a deeper connection with one another , ’ said the university			2
similarly , a study from the @entity196 last year found that that social networks are useful tools to help diagnose a person ’s psychiatric condition , by studying how they behave on the sites			0
researchers in @entity204 also found social networks can spark a natural high leading to a relaxed heart rate and lower levels of stress and tension .			0

the research was carried out by at @entity38 , @entity8
it discussed the case of ' @entity216 ' who was hospitalised for suicidal thoughts
her symptoms began eight months before she was hospitalised *–* and she had no previous history of psychiatric illness
four months earlier she was reported as using @entity4 ‘ excessively ’
she experienced delusions and believe a celebrity was talking to her
she also reported seeing hidden symbolic messages in tweets
mrs @entity28 then started to spot these hidden symbols in the real world
