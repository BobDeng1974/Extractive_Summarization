fat ? who ? me ? oh , get away with you			1
yes , it ’s strange , but true : two years ago , i was so far into self - deception that not only did i not mind being fat , i honestly did n’t even realise that i was			1
where others might have been buffeted by shame , i had hurtled north of 60 in merrier mood , counting the blessings , but never the pounds			1
the hair was , and is , unblemished by grey			1
adapting the mantra that ‘ when i am old i shall wear purple ’ , my wardrobe eschewed chic black in favour of riotous colour			1
@entity18 says : ' you are fat because you gave your stomach too much and now you 're giving it too little			1
of course it 's going to growl			1
' as for my fading eyesight , i turned it into a plus with a costly passion for outrageous glasses			1
but the body ? ah , the body			2
i think the mindset changes when you reach the age when your body is never again likely to be seen by anyone who has not already seen it			2
it ’s not an overnight thing , but you start to cross lines — not least the line between dressing the body and draping it			2
i ate like a pig , the scales gathered dust and dresses grew wider			2
i no longer struggled upstairs on a bus , my ankles swelled in heat and i bought a bath with handles			2
still , i thought , that ’s just age			2
is n’t it ? and so to the awakening			2
a routine medical began with being weighed			2
‘ two hundred pounds , ’ the ( skinny ) nurse intoned			1
or , if you prefer , 14 stone 4lb			2
on a 5ft 6in frame			2
worse were blood sugar levels teetering towards diabetes			2
i did n’t need the doctor to mention the elephant in the room — and rarely has the phrase been so aptly used			2
on the @entity68 ( body mass index ) scale i had waddled into ‘ obese ’ ( over 30 )			2
something had to be done			2
but what ? please , please let it not be a diet			2
@entity73 knows , i am no stranger to diets			1
in younger days — propelled by vanity , not health , i would happily diet to 9st while smoking 40 a day — i tried the lot			0
90 per cent of @entity80 women have been on some form of diet in their lifetime - on average spending a staggering 17 years of their life dieting from cabbage soup to grapefruit to high - protein to low - fat , from counting calories to counting carbs to injectable stimulants			1
and while i would — temporarily — lose weight , what i gained was an abiding loathing of the diet industry			1
the bare facts disgrace us : 29 million people in @entity80 tried to diet last year , with 39 per cent buying into the trendy 5:2 , which is propelling its creator , @entity100 , towards the @entity101 already climbed by his diet guru predecessors			0
dr @entity103 ( ten million books sold ) died a millionaire — albeit a fat one ; @entity106 ( seven million sold ) is similarly wealthy			1
yet all this money , together with billions generated by diet clubs , recipe books , supplements and ready meals , is made out of selling the lie that they will work when in the long run they do not			0
what is worse , the only way this industry can keep the lie alive is to turn clever women into stupid women			0
answer this : which makes you fatter : a large sweet potato , roasted in oil then piled with cinnamon sugar and melting butter , or two sticks of celery ? see ? the fact is , any adult with an iq above room temperature knows what makes them fat			1
and so back to my dilemma : dangerously porky , determined not to be , but damned if i would go on a diet			0
so , i resolved to lose weight my way			1
the @entity68 index hinted three stone should be enough ; that ’s 42 pounds			1
i decided to lose one pound a week , every week , for 42 weeks			1
what annoys my friends is that i ca n’t tell anyone else how to do it — if i could , i might sell a million books , too			0
all i can say is that i neither counted nor weighed anything			0
i relied instead on ‘ more ’ , ‘ less ’ and ‘ none ’			1
the first two were trial and error : if the pound failed to budge one week , i ’d revise the ‘ more ’ to ‘ less ’			1
‘ none ’ was easy : some pleasures stayed sacrosanct ( butter , @entity156 pudding , red wine ) , others i banished ( beer , cheese , sugar )			0
unlike diets , when all you think about is what you are next ‘ allowed ’ to eat , i put food on the back burner			1
unlike diets , i told myself no lies			1
the first great lie that diets tell is that their food is delicious when it is not — egg - white omelettes enlivened by cottage cheese ? why pretend ? instead , i expected my food to be fuel , not fun			1
breakfast — yoghurt , seeds , nuts and berries — and lunch — a small sandwich — passed without note			0
dinner was steak or chicken with veg ( hence the butter and red wine )			0
the second great diet lie is that you wo n’t be hungry ; there is that terrific snack for elevenses and another at teatime … ' all i can say is that i neither counted nor weighed anything			0
i relied instead on ' more ' , ' less ' and ' none '			1
' says @entity18 , who lost 42 pounds in 42 weeks this is nonsense			1
you are fat because you gave your stomach too much and now you ’re giving it too little			1
of course it ’s going to growl			0
fact : if you do not feel hungry on occasion , then you are not losing weight			0
maybe this is why so many diets fail			1
the discomfort feels like a betrayal , you do n’t believe in the diet any more , so where ’s the biscuit tin ? however , i could only let myself down			0
one trick was to drink a pint of fizzy water and go early to bed feeling full			0
another was to drink the water and red wine … then go early to bed with a smile			0
the point about losing weight my way is that everyone would choose different non-negotiables , different banishments and different tricks			0
the loss is in any case slow , so for ages it is unnoticeable			0
i did keep track , but because i was doing it for health i used a @entity68 chart : down it crept , from the ‘ obese ’ 33 to — hallelujah ! — merely ‘ overweight ’ at 29 ( 180lb )			0
in time , bonuses cheer you along , like the first time i hopped upstairs on a bus without thinking about it			0
clothes fitted better , then not at all : just too big , at 20 or 18			0
their replacements were less draped and more tailored			0
i could clamber more easily from the bath — of course i could ; have you tried lifting a suitcase weighing 42 lb ? my shoe size dropped , my ankles shrank , my puff calmed			1
‘ @entity249 ’ eventually fell into a ‘ normal ’ @entity68 of 25 as , after 40 weeks , i reached a loss of exactly 42 lb , to weigh 11 st 4lb			1
better yet : my blood sugars also read ‘ normal ’			0
admittedly , i am no string bean ; i am a size 14 and need shapewear			0
nevertheless , i understand my body better than ever and feel absurdly proud that i took control of it myself , rather than relinquishing it to someone else ’s rules			0
so , again at my own behest , i chose to stop losing weight			0
and here ’s the best bit of all			0
it is a year since i stopped			0
a year during which , if i gained a pound , i immediately took it off again just by following the same principle of self - control			1
this means that today , as i write , i still weigh the same 11 st 4lb			0
smug ? oh , you bet			0

hater of diets , when @entity18 realised she was fat she was *n't* sure what to do
she needed to lose 42 pounds
decided to lose a pound a week for 42 weeks
relied upon ' more ' , ' less ' and ' none ' , rather than calorie counting
