shareholders are reeling from big losses in their investments and pension funds as @entity1 ’ share price has plunged since the financial crisis			1
last year its profits dropped again by 21 per cent to £ 2.3billion after it was hit by huge bills for wrongdoing			1
but yesterday chairman sir @entity0 defended the bank ’s decision to pay out £ 1.86billion in bonuses , including packages of more than £ 1million to 359 employees			1
group chief executive @entity38 saw his pay package more than triple to £ 5.5million , after opting to accept a £ 1.1million bonus			2
facing criticism over the pay package , sir @entity0 claimed the bank needed to pay ‘ competitively ’ to attract the best talent			1
but the argument received short shrift from investors who have seen @entity1 fork out billions for various scandals while the share price has fallen from £ 7 to just under £ 2.60			1
during the height of the financial crisis in 2009 they fell to 47p , leaving many savers who sold their shares with huge losses			1
shareholder @entity58 said : ‘ employees should share the wealth created by great companies			2
my problem is what happens when there is no success – and there is limited success in this company			0
’ referring to @entity70 ’s ‘ what have the @entity71 ever done for us ’ sketch , mr @entity58 said : ‘ i ’d like to paraphrase @entity70 and ask what has all this “ talent ” done for us ? ‘ the answer is this talent has made losses for shareholders , destroyed value and dragged our reputation through the mud to the extent that banker has become a dirty word			2
yet these people have enjoyed massive salaries and we ’ve paid for it			0
’ at the meeting , @entity1 ’ bosses referred repeatedly to the moral values of the bank ’s @entity94 founders , with chairman sir @entity0 describing how they ‘ relied on their own hard work , pioneering spirit and moral code to become trusted figures in their communities ’			1
huge bonuses : group chief executive @entity38 saw his pay package more than triple to £ 5.5million , after accepting a £ 1.1million bonus			1
sir @entity0 said the bank had to pay ‘ competitively ’ to attract the best talent billion pound bill : @entity1 is currently waiting for a huge fine for manipulating the £ 3trillion - a - day foreign exchange market , and has set aside almost £ 1.3billion so far for the scandal rogue traders in @entity21 orchestrated a worldwide conspiracy to rig interest rates , landing @entity117 ’s biggest bank with a record £ 1.7billion fine			1
several banks have already been penalised after traders were caught manipulating @entity123 interest rates , which are used to set the cost of mortgages and are linked to trillions of dollars of investments around the world			2
so far total fines against banks including @entity1 and @entity131 have hit £ 5.6billion			1
but the latest settlement dwarfs the £ 1billion levied against @entity133 in 2012 , which was previously the biggest fine issued for rigging @entity123 rates			2
at least 29 employees were involved in the wrongdoing , which lasted between january 2005 and december 2010			0
most of the rogue staff were based in @entity21 , but they also worked in @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 – showing the global nature of the conspiracy			0
so far just 12 of the people involved in rate - rigging have been sacked , but @entity148 regulators have now ordered @entity149 to fire another seven staff , including six senior employees in @entity21			0
@entity152 , executive director at consumer group which ? , said : ‘ rigged markets will ultimately hit people in the pocket , so the regulator must continue to take tough action			0

@entity1 is currently waiting for a huge fine for manipulating the £ 3trillion - a - day foreign exchange market , and has set aside almost £ 1.3billion so far for the scandal			1
last year it was also forced to set aside £ 1.1billion for mis - selling payment protection insurance , taking its total bill so far to £ 5.2billion			0
@entity175 – @entity176 said : ‘ the men who started it were honourable			0
but you seem to have lost your way			0
