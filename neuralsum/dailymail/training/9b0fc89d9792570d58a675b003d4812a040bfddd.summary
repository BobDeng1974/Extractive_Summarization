by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 15:31 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 16:31 est , 18 november 2013 @entity3 @entity2 sen. @entity2 told an audience in @entity5 , @entity6 last week that the wave of health insurance cancellations following the @entity10 's implementation came from ' a regulation written by president @entity12 ' months after he signed the law			1
and every @entity15 @entity14 , he said during his nov. 11 remarks , voted against the @entity2 's attempt to block the regulation			1
speaking at @entity19 , an influential monthly gathering of conservative movers and shakers , @entity2 said @entity15 @entity2 tried in 2010 to block an @entity10 rule that only permitted @entity1 to keep their health insurance policies if nothing about them was changed from year to year			1
that ' grandfather ' clause in the @entity12 administration 's regulations has been widely faulted for causing nearly 5 million policy cancellations , and analysts estimate that number could climb to 12 million			1
president @entity12 pledged on thursday to give insurers a one - year grace period , and @entity35 @entity2 passed a stronger measure on friday that would empower the companies to keep selling their 2013 policies indefinitely			1
' it ’s 20,000 pages of regulations			0
the @entity54 was 2,000 pages			0
and i did n’t realize this until this week – the whole idea of you losing or getting your insurance cancelled was n’t in the original @entity10 [ law ]			1
it was a regulation written by president @entity12 , three months later			0
' in a little - noted nov. 5 report , the influential @entity62 claimed that ' [ t ] he @entity65 decided – all on its own – that any routine change made to a grandfathered plan would invalidate the promise that you can keep what you had			2
' citing that report , @entity2 described the @entity2 's attempt to do away with that regulation in 2010 , months before he became a @entity1 senator			1
' the @entity2 had a vote to try to cancel that regulation so you could n’t be cancelled – to grandfather everybody in , ' he said			1
' you know what the vote was ? straight party line			0
every @entity14 voted to keep the rule that cancels your insurance			2
' watch the full speech on @entity87 looking ahead ? sen. @entity2 is seen as a likely 2016 presidential candidate , but first he aims to force as many @entity90 into retirement as possible the @entity2 proposal came from @entity93 @entity2 senator @entity2 , who sought to overturn what he warned would ' threaten small businesses with higher health care costs , more regulation , and even loss of the health insurance many of their employees rely on			1
' ' throughout the health care debate , the president continually promised , " if you like what you have you can keep it , ' " @entity2 said at the time			2
' the grandfathered health plan rule breaks the president ’s promise			2
' his proposal , a joint resolution expressing ' congressional disapproval ' of the grandfather clause , failed on a 59 - 40 vote strictly along party lines			1
during a brief debate , @entity118 @entity117 sen. @entity117 complained that ' only in the @entity121 could you get away with telling the people " if you like what you have you can keep it , " and then pass regulations six months later that do just the opposite , and figure that people are going to ignore it			0
' in his @entity5 speech , @entity2 claimed politically vulnerable @entity90 including @entity130 or @entity131 and @entity132 of @entity133 will find it difficult to explain their 2010 votes when they run for re-election next year			2
sen. @entity2 proposed a measure in 2010 that could have gutted the @entity10 ' grandfather ' regulation , but every @entity14 – including @entity130 of @entity131 – voted to block the attempt vulnerable ? @entity133 @entity141 sen. @entity132 voted for the @entity10 , and also voted against a @entity2 move to get rid of the law 's ' grandfather ' regulation " this week , have you noticed ? ' he asked			1
' @entity90 are , like , going to the @entity35 and saying , " mr. president – what did you do ? ' " ' we 're not responsible for this , ' he described them telling their constituents			2
' the president cancelled your insurance , but not us			0
because we 're running in the @entity156 now , and we 've got a @entity2 running against us			0
' but @entity132 and @entity130 ' voted specifically , not just for @entity10			0
they voted for the rule that says if your insurance ever changes , you 'll be cancelled			0
' spokespersons for @entity132 and @entity130 did not respond to emails seeking comment			0
a @entity166 poll released monday showed that 58 per cent of @entity1 – a new high water mark – have an unfavorable view of the @entity10			0
@entity169 , the @entity6 author and businessman who organizes the @entity19 , told @entity171 that his events ' really do get a lot of real , candid comments from big - name politicians			0
' ' i 'm not surprised sen. @entity2 raised some eyebrows			1
these meetings give people an opportunity to see our national leaders outside of three - minute sound bites			0

in a 2010 @entity15 vote , @entity2 failed to block the @entity10 regulation responsible for as many as 5 million insurance cancellations
the vote was 59 - 40 , with every @entity14 opposed
sen. @entity2 told a partisan crowd last week that the rule was never part of the @entity10 , but was *tacked* on later by the @entity35
the so - called ' grandfather ' clause virtually guarantees the cancellation of *private* health insurance policies that change in any way from year to year
