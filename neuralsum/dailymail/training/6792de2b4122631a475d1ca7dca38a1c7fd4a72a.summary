this weekend sees the first blockbuster sporting weekend of 2015 with football , rugby , boxing , and cricket all on the agenda			2
fancy doing a 24 hour marathon of watching all the sport ? well , @entity8 has put together a guide of how to do just that			2
saturday 28 february 10.30pm @entity12 vs @entity13 the 24 hours of sport starts with the super-bantamweight fight between @entity12 ‘ @entity16 and @entity17 challenger @entity13			1
the fight is live on @entity19 which is a boost for the sport as there is potential for a wider audience			2
@entity12 ( centre ) will be defending his @entity26 super-bantamweight world title vs @entity13 on saturday 10pm - 6am @entity27 vs @entity28 once the ‘ @entity36 ’ has kept his unbeaten record intact ( hopefully ) , switch over to @entity32 ' @entity31 channel and watch @entity34 ’s @entity27 face @entity28 in @entity35			1
unless @entity12 gets the job done early , then you are likely to miss a few overs , and if @entity27 are batting then maybe a few wickets			1
but after two defeats in a row for @entity27 , they got back on track against @entity45			1
now they will look for a second win to push them closer to a place in the quarter finals			2
if the worst happens and @entity27 collapse then you may have a chance for a full fry up , but just a bowl of cereal if this goes the distance			1
@entity27 will be hoping to secure their second win at the @entity58 when they face @entity28 sunday 1 march 6am to 7.30am – either 90 minutes of shut - eye or just have a hearty breakfast to set you up for a return to the sofa 7.30am - 9am @entity65 repeat with live sport dominating proceedings on saturday night , it was inevitable that there would have to be a sacrifice , but worry not , as @entity65 is back on @entity71 on sunday morning			1
so if you have managed to avoid finding out the scores from @entity74 vs @entity75 and @entity76 vs @entity77 then now is the chance to catch up and watch the highlights with @entity80 and the boys			2
or , if you fancy something different , @entity8 's @entity82 hosts @entity84 on @entity32 1 from 8am			0
@entity65 will be repeated on @entity71 during sunday morning if you miss it on saturday night 9am - 12noon filler @entity86 vs @entity89 / @entity88 vs @entity90 / make a sandwich if you are really determined to see through a full 24 hours of sport , then you will have to choose between @entity31 cricket or @entity95 action for your next helping			1
@entity97 takes his @entity90 side to @entity88 , in what will be a tough test for the former @entity102 manager against a side pushing for the @entity104			0
@entity86 go into their game with @entity89 bottom of @entity108 and without a win from their two games			0
@entity89 have not fared much better , with their only win coming against @entity113			0
there is plenty of time to make a midday snack to keep you going			0
@entity86 ( left ) go into their @entity58 clash against @entity89 sitting bottom of @entity121 and winless 12noon - 2pm @entity123 vs @entity124 the real action gets going at midday when two of the @entity128 ’s heavyweights meet at @entity129			0
both @entity124 and @entity123 suffered disappointing defeats in @entity131 in the week and will want to respond with a good performance in the @entity128			0
with @entity134 not in league action this weekend , @entity124 know a win will see them cut the lead at the top of the table to two points			1
while @entity123 will want to narrow the gap between them and the top four			0
@entity123 and @entity124 will both want to forget their @entity144 hangovers when they meet on sunday worried someone might interrupt your weekend of sport by trying to watch the @entity149 omnibus ? worry no more with this brilliant case which is being given away on @entity151 by @entity152			2
click here for more information and follow @ @entity155 2pm - 4pm @entity156 vs @entity158 / @entity157 vs @entity159 there will hardly be any time to put the kettle on between the two @entity128 games , because as soon the game finishes at @entity129 then @entity156 will be kicking off against @entity158 in @entity164			0
the @entity158 may be @entity27 ’s last representatives in the @entity166 , but they are struggling domestically			2
in fact they have not won at @entity156 since january 1996			0
to give you some idea how long ago that was , it was the same week that @entity173 ’s @entity172 knocked @entity175 ’s @entity174 off the top of the charts			0
make sure your batteries in your remote control are fully charged because they will be working overtime			0
if you fancy a break from the @entity128 then flick over to @entity32 and watch a very tasty @entity184 derby between @entity157 and @entity159			0
both teams a going well and pushing for a promotion with the @entity159 just one point above the @entity157			0
with the top of the @entity189 so tight , a result in this game could go a long way to deciding which side is better placed for promotion			0
@entity195 ( second right ) scored a late equaliser as @entity156 drew at @entity158 in the reverse game this term 3pm - 5pm @entity199 vs @entity27 there will be more channel hopping required here as this will be the busiest part of the day , because over in @entity205 the two unbeaten sides in the @entity204 go head to head when @entity199 face @entity27			1
with the @entity210 up for grabs both sides will be determined to win , and for @entity27 it will be a chance to get revenge for missing out on the title last year as @entity199 triumphed			1
@entity214 will prove a key player for @entity27 if they are to beat @entity199 in their @entity204 clash on sunday 4pm - 6pm @entity218 final next to @entity220 and there is more channel hopping required			1
stick with the rugby on @entity71 if @entity27 are winning or switch to @entity32 1 for @entity218 final if they are losing			1
@entity164 rivals @entity134 and @entity223 go head to head for the first piece of domestic silverware of the season			1
@entity229 is yet to win a trophy in his second spell at @entity134 and is desperate to put a cup in the trophy cabinet			2
spurs have already beaten @entity134 this season and will hope for a repeat of the 2008 final when the north @entity164 side came out on top thanks to a @entity240 winner			1
@entity240 's goal gave @entity223 a 2 - 1 win vs @entity134 after extra-time in the 2008 @entity218 final 6pm - 8pm @entity245 vs @entity246 / dinner had your fill of @entity251 football ? luckily @entity245 v @entity246 is served up next on @entity32 5			1
you would be forgiven for taking a break to make some food at this point , but this should be a decent game between third and fifth			0
after the @entity218 final the attention switches over to @entity261 where @entity246 travel to @entity245 8pm - 10pm @entity263 vs @entity266 / @entity265 / @entity264 finish off the marathon with @entity263 vs @entity266 on @entity32 5			1
if you are in danger of nodding off then @entity268 and @entity269 are sure to keep you awake a little longer			0
but once that is done , go to bed , you deserve it and more than likely have work in the morning ! your sunday evening viewing is concluded with the option of watching @entity263 host @entity266 at 8pm			2
