by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 10:12 est , 1 october 2013 a mother lost 10 stone in 18 months by turning her home in an assault course			0
@entity5 , 28 , was desperate to slim down after ballooning to a size 26			1
but the mother - of - three could not afford to join a gym - so she turned her home into a tough assault course			1
@entity5 , 28 , weighed 19st and was a size 26 ( left ) before she turned her house into an assault course in a bid to lose weight			1
she now weighs 9st ( right ) and says she feels ' absolutely amazing ' ms @entity5 , who weighed 19st , used the baby gate at the bottom of the stairs as a hurdle to jump over hundreds of times			1
she also used tins of baked beans and spaghetti hoops as weights in her strict daily exercise regime			1
her stairs were then turned into a stepping course and she did star jumps in front of her tv			1
she said : ‘ i was absolutely enormous - i could n’t bear to look in the mirror or to have my photo taken			1
‘ i hated the sight of myself so much i would n’t pose for pictures with my kids			2
‘ to curb my unhappiness i ’d stuff myself with a @entity37 takeaway for four and then tuck into a giant slab of @entity39			0
’ ms @entity5 was so ashamed of her weight that she avoided having her picture taken			1
she decided to lose weight when she realised there were no pictures of her with her children ms @entity5 could not afford to join a gym so she turned her house into a ' boot camp ' - she ran up and down the stairs , hurdled over the stair gate and used food tins as weights then one day as ms @entity5 looked through old photo albums she realised there were n’t any pictures of her with her children			1
it was a turning point and the shame finally gave her the motivation to lose weight			1
she said : ‘ i felt so sad and i realised i was too ashamed to be in pictures because i was such a fat blob			1
‘ i am 28 and i felt 65			2
i was puffing and panting everywhere			0
ms @entity5 ( pictured with her partner , @entity62 ) said : ' i 'd pull the curtains to stop the neighbours seeing me in action - it would have been so embarrassing			1
but the results have paid off and now i 'm ten stone lighter ' ‘ but i could n’t afford to go to the gym so i decided to turn my home into a boot camp			1
’ ms @entity5 began a brutal regime of exercise starting by running up and down the stairs in her home in @entity77 , @entity78			1
she dug out the baby gate to use as a hurdle			2
and while her children watched tv in the lounge she would do star jumps and jog on the spot			1
after the children went to bed , mrs @entity5 would grab large tins of beans and spaghetti - to use them as weights			1
ms @entity5 says that before she lost weight she felt like she was 65 and that she was always out of breath			1
now she says she is no longer the fat mother at the school gates she said : ‘ i ’d pull the curtains to stop the neighbours seeing me in action - it would have been so embarrassing			2
‘ but the results have paid off and now i ’m ten stone lighter			0
‘ now i ’m no longer the fat mother at the school gates and my kids ' friends do n’t make fun of me			0
’ now ms @entity5 weighs 9st and she has swapped her t - shirts for tight fitting dresses			1
she said : ‘ i feel absolutely amazing			1
when i tell people i lost 10 stone after turning my house into a boot camp they do n’t believe it			1
but it ’s absolutely true			2
‘ i ’m living proof that you do n’t need a gym to shed the weight			0
a few cans of baked beans and a baby gate will do just the same job			0
’ below , @entity123 - based personal trainer @entity122 shares her suggestions with @entity125			0
biceps curls - hold a small bottle of water or a tin of food in each hand			1
stand up straight and keep your elbows close to your torso with your palms facing forward			0
keeping the upper arms stationary , raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the weights are at shoulder level			0
then , slowly lower the weights back to the starting position			0
overhead triceps extensions - hold a bottle of water of tin of food in both hands and lift your arms above your head			1
lower your forearms behind you by bending your elbows			0
avoid allowing the weight to hit the back of your neck			0
raise the weight overhead again by extending the elbows			0
sit ups - lie on the floor with your feet flat and shoulder distance apart			0
place a medium - weight book on your chest and put your hands over it to hold it in place			2
using your stomach muscles , bring your body up to 30 degrees before lying back down again slowly			0
repeat 10 or 15 times before having a rest and starting again			0
lunges - begin with one foot on the bottom step of the stairs			2
extend your other leg behind you until your weight is on the heel of the front foot and ball of the back foot , with back heel lifted			2
lower the back knee straight down towards the floor and then lift up slowly to start position			0
repeat 10 - 15 times with each leg			0
advanced plank - place your elbows on the floor then stretch your body out behind you and put your toes on the bottom step of a flight of stairs			2
pull your stomach muscles in and keep your back flat			0
hold this position for about 60 seconds			0
running up and down the stairs - this is usually safe as long as you ensure there is nothing on the stairs that you could trip over			2
it is also recommended that you wear trainers to provide support			0
jogging on the spot and star jumps - these are also good exercise but it is recommended that you wear trainers to support your ankles .			2
