a woman who spent a decade trying every diet under the sun has undergone a body transformation in just 12 weeks			1
@entity4 , 33 , from @entity5 , struggled with her shape since her early 20s and has never managed to shift excess weight , especially around her middle			1
after giving everything from @entity10 to the @entity12 diet a go over the last 10 years , she finally got the toned , taut body she dreamed of after discovering weightlifting , and pairing it with a healthy diet			1
the former size 14 can now fit into size 8 clothes , and her body fat percentage has dropped from 24 to 19 per cent , showing off her toned muscles			1
@entity4 said : ' i 've tried every diet you can think of but nothing really stuck			2
at first , it was bizarre muscling my way into the weights room at the gym			0
' @entity4 had spent every year since she finished university trying two or three diets a year			1
her eating plans included the @entity39 diet , the 5:2 diet , weight watchers , @entity43 's 21 day detox , no carbs after 5pm , low carb evenings , the @entity47 diet , and juice fasting			2
but @entity4 yo - yoed and could n't keep the weight off , ranging between a size 8 and 16 over 10 years			1
as soon as she was under stress she would turn to doughnuts , chocolate and coffee and would skip the gym when her job in @entity57 got busy			0
she embarked on the @entity59 fitness programme that combines healthy eating with intense weight training all her eating and exercise habits have changed and she 's clued up on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle when her friend @entity65 suggested she try the @entity67 programme @entity4 never thought she would find herself at home with bench pressing in the weights section			1
but in just 12 weeks of the fitness programme that combines healthy eating with intense weight training she lost 2.3kg and developed a six pack			1
the free body transformation challenge is based around a five day programme with two rest days , booked online , but the optional @entity59 supplements and shake powders are paid for , available through their website			2
thanks to switching snacking on @entity79 's and @entity80 to lean meat , veg and brown rice @entity4 sent her body fat from 24 per cent down to 19 per cent			1
she followed a plan of daily exercise to tone her abs , arms and legs and tried out protein supplements to help kick - start her complete makeover which saw her go from a size 14 to a size 8			1
breakfast : nothing lunch : three courses of soup with bread , cheesy pasta , and a cake for desert dinner : large spaghetti bolognese snack : lots of full - fat milk coffees , doughnuts pre and post-workout whey protein shake breakfast : porridge lunch : salad with grilled chicken , brown rice dinner : fish with steamed vegetables snacks : handful of nuts pre-workout @entity59 supplements : @entity123 and @entity124 she took protein supplements to help her complete makeover which saw her go from a size 14 to a size 8 day 1 – legs and abs ( squats , lunges , free weights ) day 2 – chest and triceps ( flat bench dumbbell presses and overhead chest extensions ) day 3 – shoulders ( overhead presses and raises ) day 4 – back and biceps ( barbell rows , dead lifts and curls ) day 5 – circuit with plank and crunches @entity4 followed the @entity59 programme pretty closely , working out for 45 minutes a day throughout the 12 weeks , for five days a week with two days off			1
she gradually increased the weights as she got further through the programme			2
week 1 - arm curling 2kg , leg press 65kg week 12 - arm curling 8kg , leg press 200kg @entity4 said : ' i 'd started loads of diets , and sometimes finished them , but it never worked			2
i 'd fall back into my old eating habits and put it all back on			0
' i thought i was eating healthily and even went to spin classes at the gym but i still had rolls around my stomach			0
i assumed food was good for me just because it says low carb and low fat on the label			0
i assumed it was good for me			0
' i was n't obese or and people did n't look at me and think i was fat , but i was n't happy and i knew that i needed to lose a few pounds			0
when i hit 11 and a half stone i became officially classed as overweight and that shocked me into action			0
but i wanted to do something that was maintainable which @entity59 is			0
' the weight came off really quickly and after just six weeks people were noticing that i 'd changed			0
' but it 's stayed off too			0
all my eating and exercise habits have changed and i 've clued up on healthy eating			0
