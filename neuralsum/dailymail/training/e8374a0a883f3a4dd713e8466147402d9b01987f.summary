by @entity0 published : 11:26 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 13:30 est , 10 october 2013 zookeepers have welcomed a new lion cub - but not the tricky task of weighing her			0
@entity5 is the second lion cub to be born at @entity7 near @entity8 and handlers had to use a sack to get her on the scales			2
weighing in at 5kg , the cub will stay with her mother until she is 12 weeks old before they are returned to the pride			0
weight - in : the lion cub registered a healthy 5kg when she was dropped into a sack and popped on the scales two pairs of hands : mr @entity23 is given a hand to balance @entity5 , who is putting up a bit of a fight , on the scales @entity28 : the lioness cub registered a healthy 5kg , but had to be wrestled into a sack for her weigh - in @entity32 : there is no doubting @entity5 ' fierce creature credentials as she snarls at the photographer park manager @entity37 said : ' even though she is a wee cutie , keepers had to use a hessian sack to help with the weigh - in , as even at five weeks old she is a real handful and can still give a nasty scratch			1
' registering a healthy 5kg on the scales , the lioness cub will stay with her mother until she is 12 weeks old before they pair rejoin the pride			1
she is expected to grow to around 150kg and brings the @entity7 pride to eight lions in total			2
mr @entity23 said : ' @entity50 and @entity5 have been bonding in the house next door to the main pride , so everyone knows there is a new kid on the block , but we just want to make sure that @entity5 is a good size before we mix her with the rest of pride			0
' park manager @entity37 added : ' even though she is a wee cutie , keepers had to use a hessian sack to help with the weigh - in , as even at five weeks old she is a real handful and can still give a nasty scratch			0
' swipe : she may only be one month old , but already @entity5 can deliver a vicious scratch with her paws big girl : at 5kg , mr @entity23 can still hold her aloft , but one day she will grow into a truly fearsome creature on the prowl : she will rejoin the pride after 12 weeks and when fully grown is expected to weight 150kgs snarl : @entity5 pulls the type of expression that makes lions the most feared creatures in the jungle adorable : she will one day by able to kill a man with a single swipe of her paw , but for now , at least , she 's cute put me down : the cub appears to object to being held aloft by doting head keeper @entity23			1

one month old @entity5 registers a healthy 5kg at @entity7
the lioness cub is the second to be born at the @entity95 *safari* park
when she is fully grown she will weigh an *intimidating* 150kg
