by @entity0 and @entity1 it is not a sight that will sit easily with @entity4			0
this is the hunky @entity6 he faces in today ’s quarter - final – and his rival ’s toned physique has not gone unnoticed in the @entity4 family			2
for among @entity13 ’s many female admirers is none other than the @entity16 ’s mother @entity15 , who is widely known to have a soft spot for the pin - up 24 years her junior who will go head - to - head with her son on @entity23			1
@entity13 posed for @entity24 to raise awareness of male cancer for the @entity28 appeal - and has attracted an army of female fans with his perfect tan and muscled physique , there is no doubt @entity13 must feel confident about his body after posing nude for @entity24 to raise awareness of male cancer for the @entity28 appeal			1
he first came to the attention of mrs @entity38 , 53 , in @entity39 two years ago , when she stood behind him and fellow heart - throb @entity40 in an accreditation queue			1
it was then that she coined the nickname ‘ @entity46 ’ for @entity40 – a label that has stuck ever since			0
she later wrote on her blog : ‘ i joined the accreditation queue behind a bevy of @entity50			2
‘ yes i do mean to use the word bevy as it included ‘ @entity46 ’ @entity40 and @entity13			1
not the worst queue i ’ve ever been in			2
’ @entity13 of @entity50 caught @entity38 's eye when she stood behind him in a queue two years ago when @entity4 played @entity40 in the quarter - finals in 2011 , she said : ‘ i ’m just one of a lot of @entity40 female fans			1
but of course family loyalty comes into it hugely			0
’ she added that said she was still recovering from the embarrassment of @entity4 telling @entity40 : ‘ my mother thinks you ’re beautiful			2
’ but that did not stop her from describing @entity40 as ‘ kind of @entity67 god - like ’			2
after posing for nude for @entity24 in 2008 to raise awareness of male cancer for the @entity28 appeal , @entity13 said the parts of his body he received most compliments about were his arms			1
‘ it must be all the tennis i play ! i ’ve never posed naked before but it was really fun , ’ he said @entity15 said she was still recovering from the embarrassment of @entity4 telling @entity40 : ' my mother thinks you ’re beautiful ' whatever @entity13 ’s ability to garner the admiration of female fans , the 29 - year - old is still expected to be outstripped by @entity4 when it comes to tennis			1
@entity88 2 @entity4 is ranked 52 places ahead of the @entity6 , and has won eight of the nine matches they have played			0
and while @entity4 reached the final last year , the quarter - final is as far as @entity13 has managed in ten @entity94			1
@entity13 said : ‘ i have a good relationship with @entity4			1
he was practising in @entity50 when he was younger			0
we always had a good relationship out of the court , and on the court also			0
he ’s a great player , one of the best players in the last few years on tour			2
' you know it is going to be difficult to beat him , also with the crowd and everything			0
but you need to have faith			0
’ @entity13 , known as ‘ @entity109 ’ to his friends , began playing tennis when he was four , practising with his father on the two hard courts in the backyard of their family home			1
this is the second time @entity4 has faced a pin - up at @entity117			0
last year he beat @entity118 , who posed naked for the same cancer campaign as @entity13 , in the semi-final			1
meanwhile , @entity4 ’s biggest obstacle to @entity117 glory is already planning to end the championships in party mood			0
top seed @entity125 will host royals and @entity129 stars at a fundraiser for his charity foundation at @entity132 , @entity133 , on the evening after sunday ’s men ’s singles final			0
@entity135 of @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 are among those due to attend the gala dinner for the @entity143 , which supports children from disadvantaged communities , especially in the world no 1 ’s native @entity148 .			0
