older people are particularly susceptible because they make up the majority of statin users and patients with cataracts , which cloud the eye and require surgery to prevent blindness			1
@entity3 researchers checked the medical notes of 14,000 people over more than eight years , divided equally between those who had used statins for at least three months and those had never taken the drugs			1

weighing the benefit - risk ratio of statin use , specifically for primary prevention , should be carefully considered			0
