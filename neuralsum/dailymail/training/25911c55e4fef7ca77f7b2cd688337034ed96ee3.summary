@entity1 ’s arrival in @entity2 three months ago was a decidedly low - key affair			1
instead of embracing her pin - up image , she let it be known that she was ‘ reinventing ’ herself as a serious actress			1
in true @entity2 style , she swiftly airbrushed her disastrous @entity9 television career from her biography , during which she was dumped as a judge on @entity9 ’s @entity12 after just one appearance and axed from @entity14 amid accusations that she could n’t read the @entity16			1
and in an effort to be seen as more than a lingerie model famous for flaunting her body , she posted a series of snaps on @entity23 of herself cycling in the @entity25 sunshine and sparring in a gym			2
but now it seems she has already ditched her attempts to be ‘ taken seriously ’ after landing a major role in a new prime - time @entity32 comedy tv series – a move she describes as ‘ the biggest opportunity of my life ’			1
in the racy clip , she says playfully : ‘ how would i do on the lesbian market ? i do n’t think i ’ve ever been appraised			2
’ the role is tipped to promote her into the a-list , with tv producers touting her to the @entity32 press as ‘ @entity9 ’s @entity61 ’ – a reference to the bombshell @entity64 actress and star of the hit show @entity68			1
@entity69 has become the highest - earning actress on @entity71 , raking in an estimated £ 22 million a year			1
and @entity1 , 35 , is only too happy to comply			1
‘ @entity69 is someone i look up to , ’ she says			2
‘ she has a fantastic , fun accent and she ’s a sexy woman but does comedy so well			2
if i could try to be a little like that , that would be great			2
‘ i ’d love a bit of her success			0
i ’ve always been the brunt of the joke			0
i ’ve always been the stooge			0
’ her new role is certainly lucrative , with some reports claiming that she has earned £ 550,000 for six episodes			1
in several shots she is seen topless ( suitably pixelated )			0
group hug : @entity1 , third from the left , with stars and executives from the sitcom , including chat - show host and series producer @entity94 , in cream jacket ‘ @entity1 is back doing what she does best , ’ said a friend last night			1
‘ it was a very conscious decision			0
she knows it ’s something of a cliche for her to be the glamour girl showing off her breasts , but she is convinced that , at 35 , this is her last big chance to break into @entity2			1
‘ despite all her past talk of reinvention , of becoming a serious actress or presenter , she knows it was her body that caught the eye of the show ’s producers			1
she finally gets it that it is her body that will bring her to the attention of the public in @entity32			1
‘ she accepts she has always been a bit of a figure of fun in @entity121			0
but what people do n’t realise is that there ’s a ruthless streak in @entity1			1
she ’s tough and she ’s a survivor			0
@entity1 arrived in @entity2 three months ago to reinvent herself as a serious actress ‘ the very fact she ’s made it on to a prime - time comedy show in the @entity32 is something to be applauded when you think about how many girls arrive in @entity2 each year trying to get work			1
’ and as proof that @entity1 is determined to ensure her pin - up statistics get the maximum coverage , she has posted a slow - motion video of herself on social media in a tiny pink and orange bikini emerging sexily from an @entity143 swimming pool			1
informing her fans last week that she has shed 7lb on the @entity146 diet , she shows off her leaner shape in a series of provocative poses			0
@entity1 ’s new show , which premieres in the @entity32 next month , is the brainchild of talk - show host @entity94 , who has become something of a mentor to @entity1			1
@entity45 stars up - and - coming @entity156 actress @entity47 ( who played @entity157 in 24 ) , and @entity46 , star of @entity158			2
@entity47 ’s character @entity159 is a lesbian who decides she wants to have a baby with her straight childhood friend @entity161 ( @entity46 )			0
but things become complicated when @entity161 meets @entity163 ( @entity1 ) , a ‘ free - spirited @entity9 girl ’ , in a bar and falls instantly in love			1
when @entity159 finally finds out she is pregnant , @entity161 announces that he and @entity163 are married – creating one very different ‘ family ’			0
@entity1 ’s performance has been a big hit with the show ’s writer and executive producer , @entity172			1
she says : ‘ our @entity32 casting director , @entity173 , found @entity1 after a long and exhaustive search			1
she remembered her from her days on the tv series @entity178 [ in 2001 ] and sought her out in @entity121			0
‘ we had seen hundreds of women for the part of @entity181			0
people were auditioning on three continents			0
we saw some lovely , talented actresses but no one quite had the right balance between beautiful and funny until @entity1 came along			2
’ @entity1 , pictured hosting @entity187 's @entity14 with @entity188 , has airbrushed her disastrous @entity9 television career from her biography she adds : ‘ @entity1 ’s tape was sent to me on a saturday night and i immediately knew she was a star , though i was n’t at all familiar with her			1
she flew to @entity143 two days later to do her screen test , blew us all away , and the role was hers by friday			2
‘ we were having a hard time finding a bombshell beauty who could really do comedy			2
i was so relieved when she came in to do her screen test because she made me laugh			0
‘ it ’s obvious to everyone that she ’s gorgeous but it ’s certainly unexpected that she can really land a joke			0
it ’s extremely rare to find someone that gorgeous and that hilarious			0
‘ she ’s already a star – @entity32 just does n’t know it yet			2
but they will , because she really does shine on the screen			0
she ’s so likeable and has such great energy and timing , i think audiences are going to be very taken with her			0
@entity1 , pictured left , is being touted to the @entity32 press as the @entity9 's @entity61			1
the @entity64 bombshell , pictured right , is the highest earning actress on @entity71 ‘ i really hope @entity45 airs in the @entity9			1
the character of @entity163 comes from that love and enchantment i have with @entity121			0
so it would be a dream for it to be shown there			0
and i would love for everyone in the @entity9 to see just how fantastic @entity1 is on the show			1
i think people will fall in love with her in a new way			0
’ the actress herself , well - known for her high - profile romances with @entity2 stars @entity237 and @entity239 , says the role has transformed her life			1
‘ i was living in a little cottage in the @entity121 countryside when i read the script			0
i had a lovely life in @entity121			0
i own a restaurant , i ’m very busy			0
it took a lot for me to leave my family and my life and come here , but when i read the script i do n’t think i ’d reacted to anything so profoundly in a long time			2
it was just a case of “ i need to get on a plane and try to get that job ”			0
’ ‘ initially , i put myself on tape and sent it to @entity94 and the producers and they said “ yes , fly out ” and i was on a plane the next day , and it ’s been a rollercoaster since then			2
@entity1 has previously had high profile romances @entity2 stars @entity239 and @entity237 ‘ i think they saw about 400 girls and i came in at the 11th hour			1
‘ when i flew in , they had a few girls lined up and the girl who came before me said , “ you have to kiss in the audition ! ” and i thought , “ oh well , i just have to go for it			0
” ‘ there are not that many roles for @entity9 girls who look like me or sound like me on @entity32 television			1
i ’m not going to get a role on @entity277 , let ’s be honest			2
‘ so i just went in there and it clicked and that was that			0
