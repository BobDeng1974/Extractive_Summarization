@entity0 blasted referee @entity1 for failing to award @entity2 a penalty as his side lost at home to @entity6			1
@entity7 scored the only goal of the game as @entity6 extended their unbeaten run to seven games			1
but @entity0 was left fuming as @entity1 turned down @entity2 ’s calls for a spot - kick when striker @entity14 was brought down by keeper @entity15 when through on goal early in the second half			2
@entity7 finishes past @entity18 to score the only goal of the game and give @entity6 the win @entity7 scored the winner for @entity6 at @entity21 to give @entity23 's side the three points @entity2 manager @entity0 was left fuming after referee @entity1 failed to award his team a penalty @entity27 makes his second debut for @entity6 as he makes his return after 14 years the former @entity31 striker looked to threaten @entity18 's goal but could n't open his second account @entity0 said : ‘ if that is not a foul and a penalty and a red card then i do n’t know what is			1
‘ book my man for diving or send the keeper off and award a penalty			2
do n’t just wave play on			0
the fourth official saw it and how the referee missed it i do n't know			0
‘ but i am also fuming because of our play			0
the game should have been 0 - 0 , we got a free kick and we did n't take it in the right way and they went and scored at the other end			1
if we had taken that the right way then the most contentious decision of the game would not have mattered so much			2
’ @entity6 made the better start and almost took the lead in the opening minutes when @entity61 ’s glancing header from a corner forced @entity2 keeper @entity18 into making a save			1
@entity27 - who was making his first start for @entity6 after coming out of retirement - showed glimpses of magic with his exquisite first touch and ability to pick out a pass			1
but was unable to find the killer ball to help the visitors take the lead			0
@entity2 ’s first chance of the game came midway through the first half when @entity76 picked out @entity14 with a pin - point pass but the striker fired his shot across goal and just beyond the far post			1
@entity18 was forced into another save when @entity83 played in @entity7 - but the midfielder was unable to find a way past the @entity2 keeper			1
and it was @entity2 who ended the half on top as @entity91 fired just wide from a @entity93 cross			0
@entity27 's second debut for @entity6 finishes after an hour as @entity23 replaces him with @entity95 @entity96 manager @entity23 issues instructions to his players as he watches them draw at @entity21 @entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity18 6.5 , @entity93 6 ( @entity99 77 ) , @entity100 6 , @entity101 6.5 , @entity102 6 , @entity76 6.5 ( @entity103 57 ) , @entity104 6 , @entity105 6 , @entity106 6 , @entity107 6 ( @entity108 55 ) , @entity14 6.5			1

att : 8,635 ref : @entity1 ( @entity127 ) 6 @entity2 were looking for their second win in a row following last week ’s victory at @entity6 and no one seemed to want it more than stand - in skipper @entity101 who ran the length of the pitch only to lose the ball and end up in the book for a foul on @entity14 - but it was enough to bring the home fans to life			1
former @entity21 midfielder @entity95 replaced @entity142 on the hour mark and was greeted to a chorus of boos			1
but he nearly had the last laugh as his first shot from distance forced @entity18 into making a save the best chance of the game fell to @entity119 whose shot hit the inside of the post before hitting @entity18 and somehow not crossing the line			2
but the visitors did take the lead minutes later when @entity7 was played through and fired his shot in off the underside off the crossbar to give @entity6 a lead they just about deserved			1
and in the dying minutes they needed @entity15 to make sure of the win as he denied @entity106 when the @entity2 man was through on goal			2
@entity6 boss @entity23 said : ‘ that ’s the best we have played away from home for a while and we were worthy of the win			2
‘ the penalty could easily have been given			0
@entity15 maintains that @entity14 ran into him and thankfully the decision went our way			0
‘ we felt we could have had one in the first half after a barge on @entity119			0
‘ but of course i feel sympathy when a decision goes against you			0
we have had them in the past when they do n’t go your way so i can understand @entity0 ’s frustration			0
‘ i did n't think the referee had the best of games for either side , but i ’m grateful the decision went our way			0
’ the win lifts the @entity96 up to 14th in the @entity189 and @entity23 can reflect on a good start to his @entity6 tenure having taken over with the side languishing in the bottom three when he took charge in september .			1
