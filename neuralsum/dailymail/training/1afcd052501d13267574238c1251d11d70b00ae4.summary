@entity2 's @entity1 telescope scans the skies for ' habitable worlds ' - but an @entity6 chemist has suggested the whole project might be a terrible idea			0
@entity9 suggests that life - forms based on slightly different amino acids and sugars could take the form of huge , ferocious dinosaurs that have evolved to have human - like intelligence and technologies			1
' we would be better off not meeting them , ' says @entity9 , who claims that it was a stroke of luck that an asteroid wiped out dinosaurs on earth , leaving the field clear for mammals such as humans			0
a scientist has suggested that other planets could be populated by intelligent dinosaurs @entity31 tryptophan : a scientists suggests that a tiny ' tweak ' to such acids could mean life on other worlds evolved very differently on other worlds , dinosaurs could have evolved into huge , intelligent warriors armed with hi - tech weaponry - but without losing their hunger for fresh meat			1
' of course , ' @entity9 says , ' showing that it could have happened this way is not the same as showing that it did			0
an implication from this work is that elsewhere in the universe there could be life forms based on d - amino acids and l - sugars			1
' such life forms could well be advanced versions of dinosaurs , if mammals did not have the good fortune to have the dinosaurs wiped out by an asteroidal collision , as on @entity61			2
' we would be better off not meeting them			0
' in the report , noted scientist @entity9 , @entity65 , discusses the century - old mystery of why the building blocks of terrestrial amino acids ( which make up proteins ) , sugars , and the genetic materials dna and @entity72 exist mainly in one orientation or shape			2
there are two possible orientations , left and right , which mirror each other in the same way as hands			0
in order for life to arise , proteins , for instance , must contain only one chiral form of amino acids , left or right			2
' such life forms could well be advanced versions of dinosaurs , if mammals did not have the good fortune to have the dinosaurs wiped out by an asteroidal collision , as on @entity61 , ' says @entity9 with the exception of a few bacteria , amino acids in all life on @entity61 have the left - handed orientation			1
most sugars have a right - handed orientation			0
how did that so - called homochirality , the predominance of one chiral form , happen ? @entity9 describes evidence supporting the idea that the unusual amino acids carried to a lifeless @entity61 by meteorites about 4 billion years ago set the pattern for normal amino acids with the l - geometry , the kind in terrestial proteins , and how those could lead to d - sugars of the kind in @entity71 .			1

life - forms based on different amino acids could be intelligent dinosaurs
mammals only *triumphed* on @entity61 *due* to ' accident ' of asteroid
' we would be better off not meeting them , ' says @entity6 scientist
