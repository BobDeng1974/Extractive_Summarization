by @entity0 as the new @entity4 season begins , @entity2 football has probably never been in such rude health			1
when @entity6 start the defence of their title against @entity9 on friday night , 40 days will have elapsed since @entity10 lifted the @entity12 trophy in the @entity13 and their time in the international wilderness is most certainly over			1
blessed with a ' golden generation ' of wonderfully - gifted players all blossoming at the same time , @entity16 swept all beside them to win the tournament for a fourth time and few would argue they were undeserved winners			0
they also won the @entity34 to complete the double even stronger : @entity6 have boosted their firepower further by signing @entity38 's @entity37 @entity6 can cope with injuries - @entity24 their triumph could also signal the start of a period of dominance similar to that of @entity45 over the last few years , with young talents coming through all the time and coach @entity48 adept at helping them along			1
domestically , the @entity2 also seem to have got everything spot on as well			0
the @entity4 continues to draw the biggest average attendances and has by popular consensus the best experience for the fans with cheap tickets and safe standing			0
it can also claim to be the most entertaining - with an average of 3.16 goals per game over the last 12 years , compared to 2.77 in the @entity60 - and the best run , making a profit year - on - year and successfully restricting ruinous debt and short - term profit hunting with the ' 50 +1 ' rule			0
these figures will only continue to improve as the fans flock to see @entity16 's @entity12 stars who , on the whole , will be playing in the league next season			1
it 's all very positive but one question remains - who can stop @entity6 ? unique experience : @entity2 grounds , such as @entity38 's @entity75 , are noted for their atmosphere unstoppable : @entity77 scored 26 goals last season and five more for @entity16 at the @entity12 happy man : @entity82 guided @entity6 to the domestic double in his first season at the @entity85 friday @entity6 vs @entity9 ( 19.30 ) live on @entity86 1 saturday ( 14.30 unless stated ) @entity87 vs @entity88 @entity89 vs @entity90 @entity91 vs @entity92 @entity93 vs @entity94 @entity95 vs @entity96 @entity38 vs @entity97 ( 17.30 ) live on @entity86 1 sunday @entity98 vs @entity99 ( 14.30 ) @entity100 vs @entity101 ( 16.30 ) both live on @entity86 1 the @entity103 sent records tumbling as they retained their title last season , wrapping things up with seven matches remaining on march 25 and going on to finish 19 points clear of distant challengers @entity38			1
they set league records for the most wins in a row ( 19 ) , the best goal difference away from home ( +38 ) and the longest undefeated streak ( 53 games going back into the season before )			0
and after all that , they then acquired @entity37 , the league 's top goalscorer and arguably the best player of their closest challengers			2
@entity124 may have been sold to @entity125 , but @entity6 still boast @entity12 heroes @entity127 , @entity10 , @entity128 , @entity77 , @entity129 and @entity130			1
with the likes of @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 also in there , all the signs point to another @entity6 procession			0
it 's an issue i raised with the league 's chief executive @entity140 prior to the @entity143 final in @entity38 last week			1
he said @entity6 's dominance would only concern him if it lasted for five years or more , admitting that a situation akin to @entity147 in the @entity148 would ' not be so good for us			1
' but he believed the situation will change given time and the right system is in place to ensure other teams can challenge for the @entity4 title			2
@entity38 are best equipped and they struck an early blow when they beat a misfiring @entity6 side 2 - 0 in the @entity143 curtain - raiser			1
first strike : @entity38 lifted the @entity159 last week , beating @entity6 playing catch up : can @entity38 's popular manager @entity161 lead a sustained challenge for the title ? but then again , @entity161 's side won the same fixture 12 months ago and went on to trail by some distance , so take it with a pinch of salt			1
starting with saturday 's match with @entity97 , they must hit the ground running			2
any slip will prove costly but @entity6 will be without some of their @entity12 stars for the first few weeks , perhaps allowing the opportunity to build a handy little lead			1
' at the moment i have only eight or nine players who are fully fit , ' said @entity82 last week , with @entity135 and @entity128 among the long - term absentees			0
@entity133 and @entity182 will also miss the start			0
@entity37 's departure hardly came as a surprise and @entity38 hope new buys @entity187 and @entity188 will be sufficient to make up the 28 goals scored by the @entity191 last season			1
missing the start : @entity128 will be out for a while yet with a knee injury new signing : @entity38 have brought in @entity187 from @entity196 to fill the gap left by @entity37 positive start : @entity188 ( right ) celebrates scoring with @entity199 in the 4 - 1 @entity34 win over @entity200 at the weekend @entity187 was certainly impressive last season as his 22 goals in @entity203 helped @entity196 into the @entity204 , while @entity205 @entity188 scored 16 in 34 games for @entity93			1
@entity161 will also be encouraged that @entity199 and @entity207 are already hitting form , having both scored in the @entity143 and the @entity34 victory at @entity200 last weekend			2
he also has @entity211 , who missed the @entity12 with an ankle injury , @entity213 , who missed the bulk of last season with ligament damage , and @entity217 , who has missed a whole year with a back injury , to return			0
but even when back to full strength , @entity38 will have to be outstanding to keep up with their title rivals			2
in form : @entity222 striker @entity207 has scored in the @entity143 and the opening @entity34 tie look who 's back : @entity211 has returned from the ankle injury that kept him out of the @entity12 it 's hard to see beyond those two for the title , leaving the likes of @entity92 , @entity97 , @entity9 and @entity100 to challenge for the @entity230 places			1
young manager @entity231 is starting to make his mark at @entity92 and the acquisition of @entity16 international @entity234 from @entity97 , sealed back in january , represents a coup			2
@entity238 winger @entity237 , who scored 10 goals last season , has joined from @entity99 on a free transfer and , with the likes of @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 in the team , they should be able to mount a challenge , especially if they avoid a slow start like last year			0
new boy : @entity92 have signed @entity16 international @entity234 from @entity97 main man : @entity92 will depend heavily on the goals of @entity253 - @entity245 @entity254 , who are desperate to end a 21 - year trophy drought and finally shake off the ' @entity257 ' tag , have again raided @entity88 for their summer shopping			1
a year after @entity260 star @entity259 made the switch , @entity97 have signed talented @entity262 for £ 12m			0
he 's the guy who scored that outrageous 50 - yard free - kick against @entity38 last season , one of 11 he got last season			2
another new recruit is £ 6m @entity269 striker @entity268 from relegated @entity270 and new coach @entity271 will hope he can combine well with @entity272			0
the job represents a step - up for @entity271 , who led @entity276 to the @entity278 league and cup double last season			0
exciting : @entity97 splashed out £ 12m to sign @entity88 's @entity262 this summer @entity9 missed out on @entity230 qualification by a single point last season and moved to sign @entity94 's playmaker @entity283 as well as @entity285 's much - maligned striker @entity284			1
the @entity287 - owned club also have former @entity289 man @entity288 and @entity291 @entity290 in their ranks , plus they 've borrowed highly - regarded @entity294 @entity293 from @entity295			0
fresh start : @entity284 has joined @entity230 challengers @entity9 from @entity285 there is every chance they will push for the @entity230 places , as will @entity301 , for whom striker @entity302 will be key			1
they lost @entity304 to @entity305 but spent £ 7m on @entity307 's @entity306 to fill the gloves			0
@entity289 youngster @entity309 , younger brother of @entity310 , will spent the season on loan at @entity313			0
things surely have to go better for @entity88 , who survived a relegation play - off to preserve their @entity4 ever - present status back in may			2
striker @entity318 , the man who scored the vital goal against @entity320 that kept them up , has been signed on a permanent basis from @entity93 and will hopefully offer the goals to propel them a little further up the table			0
coming into the top flight are ' yo - yo club ' @entity87 and @entity98 , who are at this level for the first time			2
@entity86 is the home of the @entity4 in the @entity331 , showing up to 115 exclusively live games every season			0
@entity86 will also show exclusively live , 38 @entity60 matches , up to 24 games from the @entity335 and action from @entity337 , @entity204 , @entity294 @entity338 and @entity203 @entity86 is the only place to watch the @entity4 live in the @entity331 , with 115 exclusively live matches			0
here is the schedule for the first few weeks of the season : friday august 22 @entity6 vs @entity9 ( 19.30 , @entity86 1 ) saturday august 23 @entity38 vs @entity97 ( 17.30 , @entity86 1 ) sunday august 24 @entity98 vs @entity99 ( 14.30 , @entity86 1 ) ; @entity100 vs @entity101 ( 16.30 , @entity86 1 ) friday august 29 @entity96 vs @entity38 ( 19.30 , @entity86 1 ) saturday august 30 @entity92 vs @entity6 ( 17.30 , @entity86 ) sunday august 31 @entity99 vs @entity91 ( 14.30 , @entity86 1 ) ; @entity90 vs @entity100 ( 16.30 , @entity86 ) wednesday september 3 @entity16 vs @entity344 ( 20.00 , @entity86 1 ) saturday september 13 @entity100 vs @entity92 ( 17.30 , @entity86 1 ) sunday september 14 @entity89 vs @entity96 ( 14.30 , @entity86 ) ; @entity91 vs @entity88 ( 16.30 , @entity86 1 )			1
