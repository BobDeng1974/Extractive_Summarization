@entity0 was convicted of assault for throwing water over her neighbour and her ' noisy ' children it started as a feud between two neighbours over the noise of children playing on a trampoline			1
now the row has ended up in court – after one of the women threw water from an upstairs window which splashed over her neighbour ’s children			1
@entity0 , 38 , was charged with assault following the long - standing dispute with next - door neighbour @entity20			1
it began when @entity0 complained about mrs @entity20 ’s four young children making too much noise while playing on a trampoline in the garden of their home in @entity27 , @entity28			1
a court heard @entity0 threw water out of her bedroom window three times , and on each occasion some of it landed on mrs @entity20 , 33			1
@entity0 denied assault , claiming she was bed - ridden with illness and was emptying a bowl of water put out for her cat , not intending to hit anyone			1
however , she was found guilty of all three counts			0
after the trial , she said : ‘ it ’s disgusting but there ’s nothing i can do			0
i thought the court would laugh and sue the police for wasting everyone ’s time			0
’ @entity49 heard the dispute began in december 2013 over noise made on the trampoline			1
@entity0 argued that the garden toy should have been kept further away from her house			2
both neighbours complained about the other , and the police had been called out before the water incidents , which happened last may			2
speaking through an interpreter , mrs @entity20 said some of the water hit her son , now aged three , which she claimed turned his dry skin condition into eczema			1
she said the trampoline had been moved after @entity0 complained about the noise			1
but she added : ‘ i ca n’t stop my two - year - old shouting or being loud			2
they are only children , they do what children do			0
’ @entity0 told the court : ‘ i probably did shout at the kids to shut up , they were constantly shouting , screeching and throwing things			2
’ chairman of the bench @entity76 gave @entity0 a 12 - month conditional discharge and ordered her to pay £ 280 costs			1
he told her : ‘ you threw water out of the bedroom window not caring where it went			1
’ last night , neighbours of the two women said they were shocked the matter had been taken to court and called for common sense to prevail			0
one , a 69 - year - old man , said : ‘ it ’s absolutely preposterous that someone should be charged with assault and be given a criminal record for a dispute that simply got a bit out of hand			2
@entity0 , who lived on this street , denied three counts of assault , claiming she was bed ridden with illness and was emptying a pan of water put out for her cat , not intending to hit anyone ‘ throwing water is hardly like throwing a punch			1
children are noisy and it is up to parents to ensure they do n’t disturb the entire neighbourhood			0
‘ in this case that simply did not happen and they caused a lot of grief			0
‘ this lady should not have reacted the way she has , but police have been called on several occasions to keep the peace and now it has resulted in this			0
’ another neighbour , a retired woman , said : ‘ when three or more children get together they always cause such a din and these were no different			0
‘ but to charge someone with assault for throwing some water is plainly ridiculous and giving this woman a criminal record is only going to make matters worse			0
i think the council need to intervene and try to keep the peace between them			0
‘ now she ’s got a real grievance against her neighbour and i ’m sure this is not going to be the last we hear of this matter			0
’ no one at @entity140 was available yesterday to discuss the dispute			0
@entity0 refused to comment last night , with a friend saying : ‘ she does n’t want to talk about it			2
