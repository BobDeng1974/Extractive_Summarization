@entity0 warned yesterday that @entity2 could be ‘ lost by mistake ’ as the battle against independence was being run so ineptly			1
his explosive intervention , on a rare visit to @entity7 , plunged the @entity9 campaign into turmoil			2
the former prime minister hit out at the negative tactics of @entity13 , @entity14 and the cross-party better together campaign run by his former @entity17 colleagues @entity18 and @entity19			1
former prime minister @entity0 said he had been motivated to join the fight against independence for the sake of his children , and his children 's children mr @entity0 warned that ‘ patronising ’ lectures about the pound and @entity2 ’s @entity29 membership risked driving voters into the hands of the @entity32			1
he suggested it had been ‘ very stupid ’ not to make a more positive case for staying in the @entity35			2
mr @entity0 went on to urge mr @entity13 to accept the challenge of a tv debate against @entity2 first minister @entity38			1
under attack : a @entity41 character in the @entity9 advert criticised by mr @entity0 the suggestion irritated @entity44 , which views the prospect as a poisoned chalice			2
mr @entity0 ’s comments 100 days before the historic vote on september 18 also prompted a backlash from some senior @entity51 figures			1
‘ everything has to be done @entity0 ’s way or he tries to dismantle it , ’ one source said			2
speaking at a lunch for journalists , mr @entity0 suggested he had come out of self - imposed exile on national politics because of fears the campaign to prevent the break - up of the @entity63 is going off the rails			0
he singled out mr @entity14 ’s decision to rule out a deal to share the pound and defence secretary @entity69 ’s warnings of major defence job losses as errors			0
mr @entity0 was also scathing about the use of @entity41 figures last week to illustrate the claim that @entity2 voters would be £ 1,400 a year better off by rejecting independence , with references to fish and chip suppers and pies at football matches			1
mr @entity0 has rarely ventured into @entity63 politics since leaving @entity44 in may 2010 with his wife @entity82 and sons @entity84 and @entity85 in the wake of @entity51 's general election defeat @entity51 did not spend too much and did not allow in too many immigrants , @entity0 insisted yesterday			1
the former premier hit back at critics of his record , blaming the economic crash on private sector greed not lavish public spending			0
mr @entity0 also took a swipe at @entity97 , suggesting the @entity51 leader was wrong to apologise in 2012 for the last government ’s open - door policy on immigration			1
the party left a £ 150billion budget deficit in 2010			0
but mr @entity0 said criticism of his government ’s spending was unfair , pointing to the huge drop in tax revenues in the crisis which pushed up the public debt			0
he also insisted global change , not immigration , was the major issue driving support for @entity115			0
‘ it ’s about how we respond , and who gets the benefit from these massive changes , this juggernaut that is taking place as a result of the opening up of the global economy , ’ said mr @entity0			0
‘ now , countries can be lost by mistake , ’ he said			0
‘ and if people come up to @entity2 , and say “ @entity63 says no to @entity2 having a share in the currency ” , @entity63 says “ you are not going to have defence jobs ” or @entity63 says “ you have got to go bankrupt ” or last week , @entity63 says “ vote independence you will lose your fish and chips , pies and you ’ll lose your holidays in @entity138 ” in a patronising way that ought to be withdrawn immediately … ‘ then the issue will become @entity2 versus @entity63			1
and people will say the debate is do you stand up for @entity63 or are you for @entity2 ? ’ mr @entity0 also issued a wider warning that pressure for devolution within @entity145 will grow			1
he said the debate in @entity2 was ‘ changing @entity63 for good ’			1
notions of a unitary state and @entity7 sovereignty were ‘ dead and buried ’			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ i can see years of constitutional change on the agenda if someone does n’t grasp the nettle here and say “ look we have got to think about what holds us together as @entity63 ”			0
’ he suggested that the @entity158 campaign should have made the debate about ‘ two visions of @entity2 ’s future ’			1
he went on : ‘ one is what i call a patriotic vision , that ’s the one i support – we have our @entity167 , our strong sense of nationhood , our own institutions , more powers , but we do n’t break every link with @entity63			2
‘ or the other one , which says every link is broken			0
’ this included pensions , health funding , the @entity177 and the @entity178 , he warned			0
the @entity179 was delighted by mr @entity0 ’s call for mr @entity13 to agree to a tv debate with mr @entity38			0
but @entity44 yesterday insisted that mr @entity38 should face mr @entity18 .			2
