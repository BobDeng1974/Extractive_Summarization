in the @entity1 , women earn an average of 78 cents for every dollar that men make — and a new pop - up shop in @entity6 is using this blatant gender - biased wage gap in order to charge its female customers lower prices than its male visitors			1
@entity14 - based pop - up store , @entity15 100 , has priced its entire stock to reflect the local gender pay gap , meaning that female customers are only charged 76 per cent of the retail price while men pay in full			1
more active protest than business venture , @entity22 is not - for - profit and aims to highlight the disparity in salaries between the sexes			0
woman 's worth : @entity29 has opened a pop - up shop in @entity14 , @entity6 where women are charged only 76 per cent as much as men in order to highlight the problem of wage inequality ' it ’s incredible how deeply unconscious biases still permeate the ways in which we perceive ( and value ) women versus men , ' owner @entity29 told @entity42			1
' i hope the shop ’s pricing helps to underscore this inherent unfairness and to create space for people to consider why the wage gap still exists			0
’ ms. @entity29 can afford the gender - conscious pricing because her shop is n't aiming to make money ; all sales from the ceramics , textiles , publications , art prints , and stationery sole will go back to the female artists who made them			0
' this is a small way that i can do something about [ the pay gap ] , and i think many of the artists involved are coming from a similar place , ' ms. @entity29 added			1
price adjustment : @entity68 sells ceramics , art , and textiles by female artists as a discount to female customers in addition to adjusting its prices , @entity22 is also holding events promoting wage equality at the pop - up space , including one for april 14 's @entity80 , which represents how far into the year a woman must work to earn as much as her male counterpart did the previous year			0
ms. @entity29 said she is concerned that women are undervalued in the workplace and underrepresented in executive positions and wants to draw attention to the problem through this venture , and added that she 's been excited about how much support her shop has received			2
' everyone that 's walked in , from women to men , has said " i love this idea " , ' she told @entity95			0
' women are worth what men are worth , of course , and just that community that 's sprung up around this has been amazing			0
' she has also reached out to local organizations for grants to help maintain the pop - up shop , which will be open in @entity14 for the entire month of april			2
ladies pay less : at the original location , women pay 76 per cent ; in @entity109 this fall , women will pay 66 per cent , since women in @entity111 make even less compared to men than women in @entity6 fans of the idea who want to get in on the action but do n't live in @entity6 can continue to check in on the organization 's website , as ms. @entity29 intends to travel with the shop , changing prices everywhere she goes to reflect the local pay gap			1
she will be re-opening the the store in @entity109 this fall , where prices for female shoppers will drop even more to 66 per cent of the original retail value , corresponding with @entity111 's pay cap			1
male customers will continue to pay 100 per cent of the price for items like a $ 224 pitcher , which costs $ 195 for female customers in @entity14 , and a $ 120 @entity135 necklace , for which women this month are charged $ 92 .			2

a store in @entity14 , @entity6 is charging women 76 per cent of what they charge men , reflecting the local pay gap
owner @entity29 says she hopes the *project* , called @entity15 100 , draws attention to wage inequality
she plans to travel with the shop and will open up in @entity109 , @entity111 , this fall
