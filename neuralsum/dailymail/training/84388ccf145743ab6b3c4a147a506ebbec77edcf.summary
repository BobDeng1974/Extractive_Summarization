following the conviction , detective inspector @entity33 , of @entity34 , said : ' this case involved a particularly horrific and sustained attack on a woman who was unable to defend herself			1
' this is a very tragic case where a young man , through his own violent actions , has killed his mother			0
he now has to face the consequences of these actions as well as to live with the loss of his mother			0
' the trial heard that @entity5 repeatedly attacked his mother in the flat they shared			2
@entity49 , prosecuting , told the jury that the defendant , who was 16 at the time , had an interest in knives and had a temper but he said the reason for the alleged murder would never be known			0
@entity5 had denied the killing and said that men came down from @entity60 in @entity61 to execute his mother because his brother had got into trouble over a drug debt			2
he told friends and the police that he had seen the man or men attack his mother through a bathroom door and when they had left he had bolted the door , taken some money from his mother ’s purse and escaped through a window and down a drainpipe			2
mr @entity5 told the jury that the defendant had spoken to a girlfriend in the hours before his mother was murdered to say she only had a couple of days to live because of the problems over the drug debt			2
but mr @entity5 alleged that this was just ' setting a scene for some sort of attack on his mother ' and that the teenager had either formed a murderous intent or the bravado of the conversation had spurred him on to commit murder because he was ' brooding ' over something that had happened between them			1
@entity5 told friends of his ' escape ' when he met up with them shortly before 3am , but they did not call the police or an ambulance			1

' interest in knives ' : @entity18 heard the teenager turned on his mother , stabbing her in the head , back and front and then blaming mystery men from @entity61 there were no injuries on her arms or hands , suggesting she was rendered unconscious early in the attack			1
@entity5 then took money from his mother ’s handbag , changed his trousers and left through the window			0
