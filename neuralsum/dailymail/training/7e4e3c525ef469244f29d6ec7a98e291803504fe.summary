@entity0 , deputy president of the @entity1 said the law does not show enough respect for @entity5 beliefs the law does not show enough respect for the beliefs of @entity5 , one of the country ’s most senior judges said yesterday			1
they have lost out in the courts while other faiths with stricter codes of behaviour , dress and diet have been able to win , said @entity0 , deputy president of the @entity1			1
@entity0 called for the law to take a new and less hardline attitude to the right of @entity5 to live by their beliefs when , for example , they want to wear a cross at work , or turn away gay couples from their hotels			1
the current discrimination laws that have ruled against the rights of @entity5 in test cases are not ‘ sustainable in the long run ’ , she argued			2
@entity0 ’s analysis , given in a lecture at @entity35 and published yesterday , suggested a new religious settlement might be based on the idea that the law should show ‘ reasonable accommodation ’ for religious belief			1
this would mean in effect that @entity5 could ignore gay rights laws or demand to wear crosses at work – as long as they were polite about it			1
failed court cases include that of hoteliers @entity51 and @entity52 , who refused to let a room to a gay couple because they only accepted married couples , and that of nurse @entity59 , who lost her claim to wear a cross on the wards			2
@entity0 herself was among the @entity1 judges who rejected the arguments of the hotelkeepers , declaring that discrimination against gay people is an ‘ affront to their dignity as human beings ’			1
but she said in her @entity74 speech that @entity5 lose in court because they can not claim that their faith demands they follow strict rules			0
‘ it is not difficult to see why the @entity5 feel that their religious beliefs are not being sufficiently respected , ' she said			2
‘ other religions with stricter dress codes or dietary laws are demanding concessions which @entity5 feel that it is harder to claim because they can not point to equivalent religious requirements			1
’ she added : ‘ the @entity86 is a very undemanding @entity86			0
it has no dietary laws , no dress codes for men and women , and very little that its members can say is actually required of them by way of observance			0
’ citing cases in @entity96 and @entity97 , she said there were precedents to allow @entity5 more room to follow their beliefs			2
@entity0 of the @entity1 ( pictured ) said : ' other religions with stricter dress codes or dietary laws are demanding concessions which @entity5 feel that it is harder to claim because they can not point to equivalent religious requirements ' ‘ would it not be a great deal simpler if we required the providers of employment , goods and services to make reasonable accommodation for the religious beliefs of others ? ' we can get this out of the @entity118 approach but not out of our anti-discrimination law			1
‘ i find it hard to believe that the hardline @entity123 law approach to direct discrimination can be sustainable in the long run			0
’ in her speech she spoke of a @entity97 case in which a couple who ran a bed and breakfast house and turned away gay guests lost in court only because of ‘ the offensive manner of the cancellation ’			0
‘ this is not an approach which is permitted to us in the @entity140 , ’ she said			0
‘ but i am not sure how comfortable i would be with the sort of balancing exercise required by the @entity97 approach			0
‘ it is fascinating that a country with an established @entity86 can be less respectful of religious feelings than one without			0
’ other senior judges , including appeal judge @entity149 and family judge sir @entity150 , have said @entity5 can not expect special treatment in the courts			0
other high - profile cases involving @entity5 include registrar @entity154 , who lost her job because she would not conduct civil partnership ceremonies and @entity161 counsellor @entity159 , dismissed because he would not give sex advice to gay couples .			2
