@entity1 's digital cloud met with an actual weather system when the company 's air conditioning system malfunctioned and actually formed a rain cloud inside the social media giant 's data center headquarters			1
the company recently revealed that when their @entity11 , @entity12 , which contains all of @entity1 's severs , opened in 2011 , the building 's energy efficient cooling system combined the hot air coming off the severs with a water - based cooling system in the air vents			1
the system was supposed to cool the air down , but instead the clash of temperatures made the air so wet that it condensed and formed a rain cloud inside the sever room , panicking workers and shorting out the social media system			1
the sever room in @entity1 's data center in @entity29 ( pictured here ) was drenched by an actual rain cloud that formed inside the building after the company 's air conditioning system malfunctioned ' i got a call , ' @entity34 , there 's a cloud in the data center ' , ' @entity34 , @entity1 's vice president of @entity35 , told @entity41			1
@entity34 continued narrating the conversation , '' what do you mean , outside ? no , inside '			0
he remembered how panicked the employees sounded , finally realizing himself that , ' it was raining in the datacenter			0
' when the freak weather event took place two summers ago @entity1 officially labeled it a ' humidity event , ' according to the website			2
the social media leader employed an air conditioning unit the used outside air instead of a less energy efficient model to cool their massive server room , which uses energy - intensive direct expansion cooling units			1
the system was designed to take in hot air coming off the severs and cool it down with the use of a water - based cooling system			1
@entity1 's data center cooling center ( seen here being shown by @entity70 , director of site operations ) malfunctioned , causing a rain cloud to form inside the company 's sever room , shorting the system the unit then recycled this cool air back out into the sever room , however , an unforeseen complication caused the air to condense as it cooled			1
the condensed air eventually accumulated and formed a rain cloud in the sever room , damaging several units			2
the company released an official account of the incident stating ' this resulted in cold aisle supply temperature exceeding 80 Â° @entity88 and relative humidity exceeding 95 per cent			0
the @entity91 servers that are deployed within the data center reacted to these extreme changes			0
numerous servers were rebooted and few were automatically shut down due to power supply unit failure			0
' since the indoor rain cloud passed over @entity1 's blue skies , the company has learned from their mistakes			1
@entity34 , @entity1 's vice president of @entity35 , could hardly believe what employees were telling him when they phoned to say that it was raining @entity1 's data center the data center now designs its severs with a ' rubber raincoat , ' @entity34 told the site			2
facebook severs now have a seal over their power supply to protect from any condensation that could form on its surface			0
' this is one of those things			0
when you are 100 per cent aircooled it 's awesome from an efficiency perspective , ' @entity34 said , ' but the range you have to operate in is much , much wider			0
' since the incident occurred two years ago the @entity1 facility has had nothing but sunny skies , so to speak , in their sever room , and after improving their building management system , predict that there 's no more chance of rainclouds on the horizon .			2

the @entity1 severs short *circuited* after a building 's cooling system malfunctioned and caused an actual rain cloud to form inside the building
hot air from the *computer* *equipment* being taken in to the air conditioning system caused the air being *pushed* back out of the unit to condense and fall as rain
