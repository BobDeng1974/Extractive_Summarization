@entity7 has taken temporary charge and in his second game got the vital win they needed to halt a slump of three defeats in a row			0
@entity15 and @entity16 put them comfortably ahead before half - time , enough to mean @entity20 's second - half strike meant nothing , although the visitors had a golden opportunity to level proceedings from the penalty spot late on - only for @entity26 to have his spot - kick saved by @entity28			1

goals scored : @entity15 16 , @entity77 referee : @entity79 attendance : 8,070 @entity4 owned up to telling @entity81 to rub cheese soaked in alcohol into an injured thigh while he was in charge , but it was the @entity6 defence that melted away in this @entity32 tie			1
in the 16th minute , @entity48 played a long ball from the back which was nodded down by @entity38 and crisply finished from eight yards by @entity15			0
they made it two on 32 minutes when @entity33 crossed deep from the left and @entity16 rose to easily head in from four yards out			0
@entity6 's @entity20 all too easily turned @entity47 and powered a shot past @entity28 on the hour mark as the visitors got themselves a foothold back into the game			2
but @entity28 was n't to be beaten again , as he made a smart stop to thwart @entity26 from the penalty spot on 77 minutes , after @entity100 was penalised for handball			2

their only win this season apart from this fixture was also in the competition , seeing off west @entity130 rivals @entity129 in the last round of the @entity32 at @entity132 .			0
