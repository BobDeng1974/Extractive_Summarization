experts believe antibiotics , acne pills and other routine treatments already in bathroom cabinets could double as dementia drugs			1
they said it is time to re-examine medicines already in circulation as cheaper , quicker alternatives to new treatments			1
many have multiple effects on the body , so some could be able to ease the effects of @entity26 ’s and other forms of dementia which affect 800,000 people in @entity30			2
there are only four @entity26 ’s drugs in use which can help relieve symptoms but do nothing to stop damage to the brain			2

‘ developing new drugs is incredibly important but it comes with a huge price tag and , for those affected by dementia , an unimaginable wait			1
