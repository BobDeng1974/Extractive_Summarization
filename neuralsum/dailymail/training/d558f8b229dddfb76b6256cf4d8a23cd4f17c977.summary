by @entity0 freeze : the @entity1 has suggested it wants to call an end to @entity3 pay rises the government is today facing threats of industrial action after signalling it wants to call a halt to @entity3 pay rises			1
instead of using funding set aside for a 1 per cent pay rise for staff , the @entity1 ( @entity12 ) is proposing it is spent on the modernisation of pay structures			1
in its submission to the @entity3 pay review body , the department said the @entity3 was facing the biggest financial challenge in its history			2
the submission read : ' despite real terms growth in its budget in successive years , it needs to continue to secure improved value from the taxpayers ' investment , if it is to meet the growing pressures it faces in the years to come both from an ageing and growing population and the need to improve the quality of care provide			0
' unions reacted with anger , saying that even raising the prospect of a pay freeze would demoralise staff			1
@entity41 , national officer of the @entity43 trade union , said : ' @entity43 members in the @entity3 are already totally fed up with this government 's cuts to @entity3 services and jobs , which staff know is putting patient wellbeing at risk			2
' if the government now wants to attack @entity3 staff pay while offering tax cuts to married couples it will be the final straw that will lead to calls for industrial action			1
' @entity58 , general secretary of the @entity59 , said : ' it is demoralising for nursing staff to discover that while senior managers have enjoyed a pay increase of 13 % since 2009 , the government are asking frontline staff to take another pay freeze to save the @entity3 money			1
' it is completely unfair to say a pay increase of just 1 % , following years of real - terms pay cuts , will prevent employers from recruiting more nurses and put patient safety at risk			0
' it is simply wrong to imply that regular pay rises are awarded to @entity3 staff simply for time served , when this is not the case			1
' increments are only paid when a nurse can demonstrate their experience and skills have improved			0
it is the responsibility of employers to ensure this appraisal system is working properly			0
' @entity88 , chief executive of the @entity89 , said : ' this is a very disappointing move that shows contempt for the principle of working together in partnership to produce a fair deal for @entity3 staff			0
fight back : unions say the government 's call for a pay freeze for @entity3 staff would lead to calls for industrial action ( library image ) ' those hard - working and dedicated professionals have suffered a real - terms pay cut of up to 12 % in recent years and only stood to gain 1 % from april			1
' the government should step back from this ill - judged position and allow next year 's pay rise to go ahead			0
' the health department said the dilemma is ' either pay staff more , accepting that this may do little to improve the quality of care for patients and is likely to restrict the number of staff employers can afford to employ , or , to reform contracts to enable employers to use their pay bill , as part of their overall employment offer , to maintain safe staffing levels , with stronger links to performance , quality and productivity '			1
it claimed the 1 per cent pay rise was not affordable alongside the current @entity3 system which sees incremental salary rises linked to length of service and performance			2
announcement : @entity138 said public sector pay rises in 2015/16 ' will be limited to an average of up to 1 per cent ' in his june spending review in his spending review in june , chancellor @entity138 said public sector pay rises in 2015/16 ' will be limited to an average of up to 1 per cent '			1
but he also said the government would reform ' antiquated ' systems of automatic pay progression that were seeing some salaries rise by 7 per cent ' regardless of performance '			2
he told the commons : ' progression pay can at best be described as antiquated ; at worst , it 's deeply unfair to other parts of the public sector who do n't get it and to the private sector who have to pay for it			0
' so we will end automatic progression pay in the civil service by 2015 - 16			0
and we are working to remove automatic pay rises simply for time served in our schools , @entity3 , prisons and police			1
' the @entity12 quoted the chancellor 's words in its submission to the pay review bodies , and said the national medical pay frameworks meant rises worth around Â £ 200 million a year			2
it said : ' this is out of step with our wider policy on public sector pay and the ambitions the chancellor set out in the spending round			0
' ' the 1 per cent that the government has made available for pay in the spending round would , in our view , be best deployed in supporting the modernisation of national pay frameworks			0
' in particular , that the reform of medical contracts should seek to improve the quality of patient care and therefore outcomes by ensuring there is a better balance between pay , performance , and productivity rather than time served			1
' substantial reforms to progression pay will be taken forward or are already under way across the public sector			0
' the priority for this pay round therefore , should be support for continued reform of national contracts so that they deliver improvements in performance and productivity , are affordable and fit for purpose			2
' putting patients at the heart of everything the @entity3 does means ensuring services are available seven days a week and that staff are rewarded for what they do for patients , not time served			0

@entity1 says money for pay rises should be spent on reform
says it would lead to ' stronger links to performance and quality '
unions reacted with anger , and said a pay freeze would ' demoralise staff '
@entity43 said plan is ' final straw that will lead to calls for industrial action '
