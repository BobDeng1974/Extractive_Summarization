by @entity0 a @entity2 warship was embroiled in a stand - off with a @entity5 patrol boat after an illegal incursion into @entity8 ’s waters			1
@entity9 , a @entity11 patrol vessel with @entity13 and @entity2 troops aboard , challenged the @entity15 ’s @entity14 and two other state ships			1
the @entity5 deliberately entered @entity19 - controlled waters as part of an ongoing ‘ campaign of harassment ’ over the @entity23 , it was claimed			1
@entity9 ( pictured ) was deployed to challenge the @entity15 's @entity24 , and two other state ships , that had encroached on @entity19 waters the incident took place as the @entity28 revealed @entity5 had made almost 600 illegal incursions in just 14 months - or ten times a week - as tensions mount			1
the provocation has prompted mps to demand a @entity2 frigate to be permanently based in @entity8 to deter @entity5 from sabre - rattling			2
only last week the @entity5 ambassador to the @entity19 was summoned by the @entity28 after one of the country ’s research vessels unlawfully entered @entity19 coastal waters off @entity8			1
the latest face - off , on monday , came when three @entity5 state vessels breached the 12 - mile territorial limit			0
an eyewitness said : ‘ it seems they entered for no good reason other than to continue harassing and illegally exerting their presence			0
‘ the @entity5 vessels made deliberate manoeuvres to provoke a reaction			0
there was nothing to suggest they were going anywhere , except to create an incident			0
’ they were confronted by @entity9 , a @entity8 patrol vessel and two @entity2 ribbed inflatables			2
the number of incursions has risen from just 30 in 2011 to 496 last year			0
so far this year , there have been more than 80 unlawful incursions , including by @entity5 police , naval and coastguard vessels			0
earlier this year a @entity5 warship had to be escorted off @entity19 territory by @entity9 after it entered the waters near @entity8			1

@entity88 mp @entity78 , a member of the @entity89 for @entity8 , said : ‘ we are getting to the stage where we need to send warships down there as a permanent presence to protect @entity19 interests and our citizens			2
‘ if @entity5 keeps encroaching on our territory , then maybe our @entity2 should start encroaching on any @entity5 ships that encroach into our waters			0
’ @entity19 was given @entity8 in the @entity100 , but @entity5 has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty			1
@entity5 aggression over the @entity23 increased after the election of @entity105 as the country ’s prime minister in 2011			0
but relations between @entity109 and @entity110 over the @entity112 territory have deteriorated drastically since the construction of an artificial reef by the @entity8 government which @entity5 says has interfered with their fisherman			2

in november , a @entity19 diplomatic bag was opened and searched by @entity5 @entity15 officers on the border with @entity8 - an incident the @entity28 described as a ‘ serious infringement ’ of international diplomatic protocols			1
repeated incursions into @entity8 ’s waters by @entity5 state vessels led to the @entity5 ambassador in @entity110 being summoned to the @entity28 for a series of dressing downs			1
in one outburst , the @entity8 chief minister has warned that @entity5 vessels entering @entity19 territory may come under fire as they are not identified as being from ‘ a friendly nation ’			1
