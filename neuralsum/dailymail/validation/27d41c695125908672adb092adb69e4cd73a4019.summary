a schoolboy who missed lessons on doctor 's orders has been refused a sixth form place because he did not go to school often enough			1
@entity5 , 16 , had hoped to continue his studies with a-levels at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , after completing his summer 's exams			1
however , the teenager , who has a number of medical conditions and underwent facial surgery twice last year , had his application refused because of his high absence record			1
' last year he had a bit of time off because of his operations and other medical conditions , ' said @entity5 's mother @entity23 , 48			1
@entity5 , 16 , has been told he can not sit his a-levels at @entity25 in @entity9 , @entity10 , after missing too many lessons			1
but his mother , @entity23 , pictured , said his low attendance was due to doctor 's orders ' when he 's not well , i 've always had him to the doctor			1
it 's always been the doctor 's advice			2
' when they tell me to keep him off school , that 's what i do			2
' i 'm a single parent with no transport , so when he 's been at @entity44 , it takes us three buses each way to get to appointments			2
' i 've done everything right and in @entity5 's interests			1
that 's what makes this so upsetting			2
' in february last year @entity5 had a septoplasty - a corrective procedure to straighten the nasal septum			1
he needed the same procedure revised in july , when cartilage from his ear was put in his nose			2
@entity5 missed two weeks ' school while recovering each time			1
his other complaints include @entity64 's phenomenon , which affects the blood supply to the fingers and toes , asthma , eczema and a list of allergies			0
@entity5 's mother said she did n't ' really know what to make of it ' after her son 's application to stay on at @entity8 , pictured , was rejected @entity23 , from @entity9 , said it felt like there had been a tug of war between ensuring @entity5 went to school and taking care of his ailments			1
after he was rejected , she said : ' i do n't really know what to make of it			2
' i 've written letters but do n't know what else to do			0
' he likes photography , graphics and science and he wants to do a-levels after his exams			0
' he 's been getting there , slowly , and doing his best			0
' @entity23 said @entity5 's progress had also been hampered by the school losing coursework for graphics and photography			1
a @entity8 spokeswoman said : ' we have no comment to make			1
' the septum is the structure that separates the right and left nostrils in the nose			0
it is made up of cartilage at the front and bone further back			0
the septum is important in maintaining the shape of your nose			0
if the septum is bent or damaged it can cause a blockage or inflammation within the nose which can turn to mucus and a nasal drip			0
a septoplasty procedure involves operating inside the nose to straighten the septum			0
it involves a doctor exposing the bone or cartilage that is causing the blockage			0
the obstruction is then removed or straightened			0
most patients who have the operation , which lasts between 30 minutes and an hour , are able to go home the same day			0
