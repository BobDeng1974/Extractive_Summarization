by @entity0 published : 06:18 est , 15 june 2012 updated : 11:12 est , 15 june 2012 adult ants are able to identify potential rivals before they emerge from their pupae , a study has revealed			2
constant patrolling of the nest ensures that a male @entity8 ant is able to bite or chemically tag a rival as soon as he is born			1
chemically tagged ants are then quickly destroyed by workers in ' death squads ' , according to researchers from @entity15 and @entity16			1
an adult male @entity17 ( left ) fights a newborn ' rival '			1
constant patrolling of the nest ensures that the adult is able to bite or chemically tag a rival as soon as he is born when ants emerge from their pupae - or eclosion - they are vulnerable to attack because their exoskeleton has not yet hardened to protect them and their mandibles are also too weak to bite an attacker			1
and a rival is easy to spot because male @entity8 obscurior ants are diphenic , either winged or wingless			1
the dominant wingless male ant , therefore , keeps an eye out for newborn winged ants			1
the researchers investigated the behaviour of male ergatoid @entity41 obscurior ants in response to newly pupated males and females , as well as their interaction with developing pupae			1
it would be advantageous for newly emerged males to hide from attackers			0
however , while winged males use chemical female mimicry to avoid being detected , young wingless males are easily detected and attacked by older males			0
if the fight occurs during the first day after eclosion the older male will always win , but once the younger male 's exoskeleton hardens his chances of surviving rises to 14 per cent			2
nearly 50 per cent of fights between older and two - day old males results in the death of both combatants			2
in addition to biting , the males also smeared each other with secretions from their anuses which encouraged worker aggression			0
the older males were more likely to chemically tag two - day - olds than younger rivals - presumably recognising that they needed help to win the fight			1
however , since both males end up being tagged they both suffer worker attacks			0
the winners of these fights smear more and are attacked less by workers			0
so although this tactic overall may provide an ' edge ' it is a risky strategy			0
lead researcher dr @entity84 , from @entity16 , said : ' older ergatoid male ants are able to distinguish pupae containing females by their chemical scent from those containing males			1
' @entity91 containing males are often bitten while those containing females , or winged males disguised as females , elicit a mating response			0
' however , the chances of mistakenly killing a female or worker possibly prevents older males from attempting to completely destroy all rival males before they emerge from their pupae			0
' @entity41 obscurior ants produce sexual females and ergatoid males throughout the year			0
in terms of colony survival this ensures that if the old dominant male dies there is a new male ready to replace him			2
the study is published in @entity112 's open access journal @entity113 .			0
