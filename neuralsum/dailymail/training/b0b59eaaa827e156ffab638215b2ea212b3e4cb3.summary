by @entity0 the days of squinting at a map or the screen of your smartphone when you ’re lost will soon be over – thanks to new shoes that tell you which way to turn			1
the shoes use a @entity11 link to communicate with your mobile ’s mapping system			1
the mobile works out which route you should be following and the shoes then emit a discreet vibration in either foot telling you when and where to change direction			1
end of the @entity22 ? the team at @entity24 , which is based in @entity25 , designed the shoe so that it connects to the owner 's smartphone via @entity11 best foot forward : using a similar concept , two engineers have created a $ 100 ( £ 60 ) smart trainer that guides its wearer by vibration			1
the team at @entity24 , which is based in @entity25 , designed the shoe so that it connects to the owner 's smartphone via @entity11 to work out their location and destination the shoes will also count the number of steps you ’ve taken and the calories you ’ve burned – and they ’ll even buzz to warn you you ’ve left your phone behind , or to alert you when you ’re travelling past an interesting landmark			1
the ‘ footnav ’ technology , called @entity49 , comes either ready - fitted in a @entity51 - red shoe or as an insole that can be slipped into any shoe			1
' they are as easy to use as a tap on the shoulder , ’ said @entity57 , 30 , who developed the shoes with partner @entity59 , 28 , in @entity60 , @entity25			2
‘ it ’s that intuitive – if someone taps you on the left shoulder , you immediately turn left			0
this product harnesses that basic instinct			0
‘ you can even communicate with them using hand gestures and finger snaps because the shoes have sensors that can pick up movement and sound			2
' you can also tell them how many calories you want to burn and they ’ll plot the perfect run or cycle			0
’ good vibrations : the shoes and insoles connect to the owner 's smartphone via @entity11 to work out their location and destination			2
that means the shoe will let the owner know when they have to turn left or right by vibrating in either the left or right shoe the @entity24 shoes go on sale worldwide in june but @entity57 and @entity59 ’s company , @entity92 , has already taken more than 3,000 pre-orders			2
@entity57 believes the shoes will also improve road safety			2
‘ if i ’m on my bike or motorbike , i do n’t want to stare at my phone – it ’s dangerous , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’d rather be guided by my footwear			0
’ he believes his innovation will prove invaluable for the visually impaired and has pledged that every mainstream pair sold by @entity92 will subsidise a cheaper pair for a visually impaired person			0
@entity106 technology does not impress explorer sir @entity107 , however			1
‘ what ’s wrong with a good old - fashioned map ? ’ said the 70 - year - old when told of the shoes			1
‘ if you rely too heavily on technology you ’re heading for trouble			0
' too many people have forgotten – or never learned – the basics : how to read a map and a compass			0
’ just say no : television presenter @entity119 is not a fan of the new shoes believing that they kill off skills like map - reading tv presenter and adventurer @entity119 is also sceptical			1
@entity119 , a patron of the @entity125 and host of @entity127 ’s @entity128 , said : ‘ the art of map - reading is dying out – killed off by inventions like this – and that ’s tragic			0
‘ the global positioning system works best when it teaches you the way so you do n’t have to use it the next time			0
' with satnav in your shoes , you ’ll never have to look even at an on - screen map so you ’ll never learn			1
that ’s going backwards , not forwards			0
