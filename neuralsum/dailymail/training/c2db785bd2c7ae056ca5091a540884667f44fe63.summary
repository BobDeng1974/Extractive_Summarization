by @entity0 published : 19:25 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 05:42 est , 11 march 2013 he suffered a very public humiliation when his apology over tuition fees was turned into a spoof video that went viral			2
and it seems @entity7 was hoping for a greater success from this keynote address by incorporating the moves of someone a little more popular , namely @entity13 pop star @entity12			1
speaking yesterday at the @entity16 party conference in @entity17 the deputy prime minister seemed to be doing his own version of the popular @entity20 dance routine			1
@entity7 could have inadvertently imitated @entity12 's dance as he compared the @entity22 to a trolley veering right taking the reins : @entity7 looked like @entity12 as he made his keynote conference speech in @entity17 he was caught by photographers gesturing at the ceiling with both arms and crossing both hands in front of him in a remarkably similar fashion to the pop star in his distinctive ‘ horsey style ’ dance			1
mr @entity7 is n’t the first to imitate the @entity13 pop star ’s moves – @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 have already recorded their own versions of the dance			1
his flamboyant body language might have been an attempt to act out his latest metaphor for @entity49 and the @entity50 - which he compared to a ‘ broken shopping trolley ’ that keeps veering to the right			1
buoyed with confidence following his party ’s victory in the @entity57 by - election , he gave a rousing speech to members at the @entity62 conference			2
giddy up : @entity7 was confident following the success at the @entity57 by - election and seemed to mimic the @entity20 dance during his speech despite woeful poll ratings yesterday suggesting the party could lose half its seats in a general election , he insisted the @entity16 had proved they were no longer a party of protest			1
the @entity16 leader told a rapturous audience in @entity17 they were ‘ no longer the none - of - the - above choice ... we are a party that is for things , not simply against things ’			2
and he spelled out what he was against by turning his fire on his coalition partners , saying it was the @entity16 who kept the government ‘ anchored in the centre ground ’			2
‘ the conservatives , on their own , will never deliver the fairer society - it ’s just not who they are ’ , he said			2
‘ the conservative party knows it needs to stay on the centre ground to have any chance of speaking to ordinary people ’s concerns			0
at least the leadership seem to			0
‘ but they just ca n’t manage it no matter how hard they try			0
they ’re like a kind of broken shopping trolley			1
every time you try and push them straight ahead they veer off to the right hand side			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity7 called for unity in the party as he appeared to imitate solo singer @entity12 he also tried to play down tensions within his party on austerity , particularly with mr @entity113 , who did not address the conference and was relegated to fringe events			1
the unity of the @entity16 is ‘ what our enemies most fear ’ , mr @entity7 said			1
‘ no one will know what we stand for unless we stand together ’			0
he told activists : ’ get back out there			0
tell our side of the story			0
and we will win again			0
on the doorstep , in town halls , in @entity84			0
keep fighting for what we believe in			0

@entity7 seemed to imitate the @entity20 dance made *famous* by @entity12
he compared @entity22 to a *faulty* *supermarket* trolley for veering to the right
