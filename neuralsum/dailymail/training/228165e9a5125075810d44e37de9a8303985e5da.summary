@entity0 is set to be appointed to @entity1 ’ backroom team as @entity3 looks to implement a 3 - 5 - 2 formation			1
the former @entity6 manager could make a dramatic return to football at @entity9 this week after productive talks with @entity3 on friday night			1
@entity3 , who played a 4 - 4 - 2 system last season , wants to replicate @entity14 ’s 3 - 5 - 2 formation during the forthcoming campaign			1
and the @entity1 manager wants @entity0 , who is well versed at playing with three at the back , to play a lead role in the transition			2
the former @entity36 manager even played as a sweeper during the closing stages of his career			0
the switch is expected to see @entity41 play as a sweeper with @entity43 and @entity44 flanking the former @entity6 star			2
even though @entity0 has n’t coached for eight years — since he left @entity46 — the 56 - year - old has made no secret of the fact that he wants to get back into football			2
he was linked with a return to @entity52 following @entity54 ’s sacking last season , but @entity56 handed the reins to @entity20			0
to keep his hand in , @entity0 has set up an academy to develop talented youngsters , as well as working as a television pundit for @entity62 and @entity26			0
but he is poised to accept a role that will see him return to football on a day - to - day basis , working alongside @entity3 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
@entity0 will be permitted to continue his punditry work as long as it does not conflict with club duties and he will be allowed to leave @entity9 should a desired management role crop up			0
tactical guru : @entity0 used the 3 - 5 - 2 formation during his time as @entity6 manager new man : @entity1 signed @entity77 for £ 6million last week but lost to @entity78 at the weekend @entity3 has been looking for a new coach since @entity81 ’s departure for @entity82 midway through last season			1
@entity41 ’s ability on the ball will be vital to @entity1 ’s transition to a new formation			1
@entity0 worked with him during his time with @entity6 , giving the 35 - year - old his full international debut in 1997			0
the 3 - 5 - 2 formation is set to make a comeback with @entity0 at @entity1 to implement the system he helped popularise in the 1990s			1
@entity0 used the formation for @entity6 ’s @entity94 campaign , having tested it out while manager of @entity32			0
at @entity9 , @entity41 will play the sweeper role that @entity0 had in mind when signing @entity98 at @entity99 in 1995			1
@entity14 ’s @entity101 revolution will also showcase the system , as he used it to guide @entity103 to third place at this summer ’s @entity27 finals in @entity28			0
top - level football is saturated with teams playing 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , so playing three at the back allows a side to outnumber the opposition forwards and go man - for - man in midfield while possessing the added attacking threat of two men up front			1
width is provided from two wing backs who must be able to contribute in both halves , with @entity101 ’s signing of @entity120 seeing the teenager pencilled into the left - sided role at @entity123			0
new signing @entity124 , who has arrived on a season - long loan from @entity127 , is expect to fill the right wing - back slot and former @entity130 defender @entity129 is the leading contender to play left wing - back			2
@entity3 still hopes to strengthen his squad before next weekend ’s opener against @entity134			2
he wants a defensive midfielder and the club have explored a potential deal for @entity139 ’s @entity138			0
@entity3 is also interested in former @entity130 and @entity32 midfielder @entity140 , who is currently at @entity141			0
brushing up : new signing @entity41 is set to be deployed as a sweeper in the new system delighted : @entity3 agreed a deal with @entity0 to join the club on friday night meanwhile , @entity3 is increasingly confident of keeping @entity147 , who had looked certain to leave @entity9 this summer after his impressive loan spell at @entity149 last season			1
but the @entity152 striker has seen moves to @entity130 and @entity154 fall through , raising @entity3 ’s hopes that @entity147 , who also interests @entity36 , can play a role for him next season			2
