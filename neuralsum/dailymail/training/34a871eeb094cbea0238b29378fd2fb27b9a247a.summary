by @entity1 reporter published : 10:13 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 10:16 est , 15 august 2013 when it comes to flirting with girls , teenage boys seem to be taking their social cues from @entity6			1
according to experts , new forms of communication like texting , @entity9 and @entity10 are becoming a crutch for teenage boys just starting to learn how to engage with the opposite sex			1
many of these boys are using texting as a streamline to get what they want , often propositioning schoolmates for sex or other acts without so much as an ' i like you '			2
cry for help ? teenage boys are using texts and tweets as a streamlined way to hook - up with girls , and it may be a sign they are n't learning traditional forms of communication @entity34 clinical psychologist dr @entity33 witnessed the problem while conducting research for her new book ' the @entity38 : protecting @entity39 and family relationships in the @entity41			1
' dr @entity33 interviewed 1,000 students nationwide for her new book and found several instances where innately sexual messages were being accepted as the norm			1
while sitting in her @entity50 class , one 15 - year - old girl got a text message from a boy in the same class who she hardly knew saying ' so , are you good at hooking up ? ' kids these days : for her new book @entity33 interviewed 1,000 american school students to learn how they communicate with each other in the digital era ' um idk			1
i do n't really think about that , ' she replied			2
' well i want my d * * * in your mouth ? will you at least be my girlfriend , ' he said			0
the girl was confused when he sent a note to her later saying he liked her			0
when interviewed by @entity69 , the girl asked whether or not she should explain to the boy how that initial conversation made her feel and then started to cry over whether it was even worth it			2
these messages obviously hurt girls , but dr @entity33 thinks there 's something to be learned from how the boy misguided attempts at wooing			1
she says it 's ' insufficient , superficial and polarizing ' to cast the boys simply as aggressors			0
their sexts may actually be a sign that they do n't know how to express themselves - skipping to the last stages of courtship before they even know a girl			0
' it 's such a bad part of our culture to think that boys are n't also harmed , ' she told today			2
' we are neglecting the emotional lives of boys			0
' when interviewing boys for her book , she observed that they did n't seem to understand the impact these messages were having on the girls they sent them to			1
one boy showed her a @entity9 message his friends sent from his account to a girl reading : ' your challenge is to go for weeks without d * * * s in all four of your holes			0
' the wrong message : experts are afraid that current social cues are teaching young men that people are disposable the boy was n't mad that his friends sent the message behind his back			1
he thought it was funny : ' this is just my friends being idiots , basically			0
they were just trying to be funny			0
' it did n't turn nasty			0
that 's the norm for our generation , ' he said			0
social media expert @entity136 says kids ca n't escape from the cues of our current hyper - sexualized culture			1
@entity142 is readily available , as are images on tv , film and even in the real - life political scandals of @entity147			0
this has gotten boys confused on how to interact with girls their own age , simply mimicking what they see happening in popular culture			2
dr @entity33 believes these teenagers are ' yearning for intimacy that goes beyond biology ' but just do n't know how to make it happen			1
parent intervention is necessary to correct this behavior because it has a costly social consequence later in life			0
' what it inevitably teaches young kids is that people in general are cheap , disposable , and easily accessible and that 's a problem because people are n't fostering real relationships anymore , ' @entity136 told today			1
child and teen specialist dr @entity171 agrees with @entity136 , saying parents should throw out the idea of the ' sex talk ' in favor of a series of discussions			0
dr @entity171 says parents should keep track of their children 's messages on their phone and all social media accounts and explain what is and is not appropriate			1
her litmus test : ' if your grandmother , your mother and your sister saw this text or this tweet , would you be embarrassed ? if so , do n't send it			2

dr @entity33 interviewed 1,000 @entity197 students and found teenage boys using text messaging and social media in a sexual way
she believes this is evidence they are n't learning to how to communicate with girls outside of the digital world
experts believe this method of communication teaches young men that people are disposable
