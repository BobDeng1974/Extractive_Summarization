in this clip , @entity8 takes on the ' widower ' and his eyes well up after just one bite			2
as the hiccups begin , @entity8 is somewhat surprisingly successful in keeping his meal down - though his dinner companion ca n't say the same			1

according to the survey , women in particular are opting for more fiery dishes - prompting men to up their game in this particular clip , @entity8 and his dinner companion are only able to take a bite of the blazing hot curry before beginning to hiccup and cry from the spice @entity8 's challenger needs to take a break from his curry once his glasses begin to fog up from the heat while @entity8 is able to keep down several bites , his partner fares far worse - becoming sick in the car park ' @entity12 has an insatiable appetite for incredibly spicy food and dishes are getting hotter every year , ' says @entity8 with the country 's rising curry obsession also comes a rising cost			1
