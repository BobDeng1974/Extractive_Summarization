@entity0 , pictured in her jewellery shop in @entity2 , opted to treat her condition with a health regime involving exercise and special foods a breast cancer patient refused to take powerful drugs she was offered to stop the disease returning – and chose to depend on a spicy low - fat diet instead			1
following surgery , @entity0 , 44 , was worried about possible side - effects from taking the medication			1
so instead , she launched herself into a health regime of exercise and specially chosen foods , including turmeric , which she claims ‘ makes cancer cells commit suicide ’			1
experts have warned there is little scientific evidence to back up her claims			0
but miss @entity0 believes that the diet she followed after undergoing chemotherapy , radiotherapy and surgery was a vital part of her recovery from the disease			1
her experience will now form part of an academic study into how lifestyle can affect the body ’s response to cancer			2
after she was diagnosed , miss @entity0 did her own research into which foods might have a positive impact on her recovery			1
and following an operation to remove a breast and lymph node four years ago , she told doctors she would not take @entity46 during remission but would be following her own ‘ anti-cancer ’ diet instead			1
she said : ‘ it ’s very unusual for breast cancer patients not to take the drug			2
‘ when i told the doctors i did n’t want to take it , they just advised me to keep oestrogen out of my body , which is basically what the drug does			2
' the doctors absolutely will not say that the diet is going to do anything to help the cancer in any way , other than to say a healthy diet is going to help in the fight against any disease			2
recovering : a picture of @entity0 in @entity67 , 2008			2
concerned about the side - effects of medical drug @entity69 , 44 , designed a vegan , diary free diet which included a range of superfoods from frozen berries to curry spices this was four years ago and i think attitudes are changing a bit now so that these ideas are running alongside the more usual treatments			1
' i believe absolutely enormously that my diet has assisted my recovery			2
’ explaining her decision not to take @entity46 , she went on : ‘ it was the worry of the drugs and the side effects , i did n’t want to have to worry about it , i wanted to be free			1
’ @entity92 , a spice used when making curry dishes the jewellery designer and gallery owner started her health regime with a mostly organic vegan diet , cutting out all dairy products , adding plenty of ‘ super-foods ’ , and taking moderate exercise			1
she said : ‘ fresh fruit , vegetables and juices are great , and frozen berries are fantastic as a super-food			1
@entity92 kind of makes cancer cells commit suicide and ginger and garlic are great to cook with			1
’ for the past four years , miss @entity0 has provided blood and urine samples and filled in regular questionnaires as part of national research into how lifestyle can help prevent the recurrence of breast cancer after surgery			1
the largest study of its kind in the world , it involves 56 hospitals around the @entity127 and 3,400 patients who have had the disease			0
the full results will be published next year			0
meanwhile , miss @entity0 , from @entity2 , is hoping to mark her five - year remission next summer and is due to marry later this year			1
describing her experience of cancer , she added : ‘ people can die , or come back from it and enjoy life			2
' you ’ve just got to be thankful you ’re still around			0
’ @entity138 used both frozen berries like strawberries and ginger root in her diet which she claims has helped recovery from breast cancer however , experts urged other cancer sufferers not to abandon conventional treatments			1
@entity148 , of @entity149 , said : ‘ it ’s not recommended that alternative therapies are used in place of conventional medical therapy			0
‘ there is little scientific or medical evidence to indicate that alternative therapies are more effective than the proven treatments used by cancer specialists on the @entity159			0
' we would urge anyone to talk to their specialist if they ’re contemplating them			0
’ dr @entity166 , who specialises in breast cancer at @entity168 in @entity2 , said : ‘ breast cancer deaths have been going down steadily for over 20 years thanks to surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy			0
‘ but there are three things patients can do to help themselves			0
it does n’t guarantee survival , but it does help			0
‘ the first is to exercise for 30 minutes , three days a week			0
the second is to not gain any weight , and the third is to reduce fat intake			0
‘ these things help to reduce the chance of cancer coming back			0
for this patient , four years on now , it is still early days			0
’ he added : ‘ my job is not to make people have @entity46 , but advise people of the risks and benefits			2
' treatment comes down to a patient , and height , weight and exercise levels are helpful in making a decision			0
’ @entity46 is @entity127 ’s most widely - used breast cancer drug , given to more than half of patients to stop tumours from returning after surgery			1
the tablets , which cost as little as aspirin and are taken for up to five years , also prevent the development of new tumours in an unaffected breast			0
the drug , originally developed as a contraceptive , is the gold standard treatment for breast cancer and has been given to millions around the world since the 1980s			2
it works by blocking the female sex hormone oestrogen from fuelling the growth of tumours			0
used after surgery , it cuts the odds of the tumour returning by around 30 per cent			0
however , it does not work in all cases			0
in contrast , the evidence for curry spices such as turmeric beating cancer mainly comes from the study of cells in a dish – while evidence from the treatment of actual patients is sparse			1
in laboratory studies it seems to be able to kill cancer cells and prevent more from growing , particularly in breast , bowel , stomach and skin cancers			1
it has also been shown to appear to stop the spread of breast cancer cells to other parts of the body in mice .			1
