@entity1 ’s oldest pyramid was built almost 5,000 years ago but a similar structure hidden beneath rubble could be up to four times older			1
if true , the claim could rewrite prehistory and shed light on an obscure yet powerful and advanced ancient civilisation			0
geologist dr @entity9 believes that a site in @entity11 is revered because it hides an ancient temple built between 9,000 and 20,000 years ago			1
it is nestled among volcanoes , banana palms and tea plantations , at 2,903 ft ( 885 metres ) above sea level some 75 miles ( 120km ) south of @entity33			0
chunks of volcanic rubble jut out up from the stepped hillside , which is considered sacred by the sundanese people who live locally			0
geologist dr @entity9 believes the site is culturally important is because it is an ancient pyramid which was built between 9,000 and 20,000 years ago			1
he suggests that it may have been built for worship or astronomy			0
the megalithic site of @entity23 ( pictured ) was discovered in 1914 and is the largest site of its kind in @entity27			0
it 's nestled among volcanoes banana and tea plantations , at 2,903 ft ( 885 metres ) above sea level chunks of volcanic rubble stick up from the stepped hillside ( pictured ) , which is considered sacred by the sundanese people who live locally			0
geologist dr @entity9 thinks the reason the site is so revered is that it is an ancient pyramid which was built between 9,000 and 20,000 years ago if the structure in @entity11 is revealed to be a 20,000 - year - old pyramid , it will be the oldest on @entity56			1
in 1996 , archaeologists discovered pyramids on the @entity60 coast of southern @entity61 that sate to around 3,000 @entity62 , making them a few hundred years older than @entity1 's oldest pyramid			1
but both civilisations built them for religious reasons			0
the @entity61 pyramids are made from shells and were probably built in phases over decades or even centuries , @entity66 reported			0
for years , experts thought the pyramids were simply piles of domestic rubbish			1
@entity1 ’s oldest known pyramid is the step pyramid of @entity75 , which was built in around 2,700 bc. it was built by a master builder called @entity78 for the burial of @entity75 and is composed of six steps			0
the ancient structure was rocked by a pyramid in 1992 , leaving it unstable with a large hole in its domed roof , but restoration is underway			1
if this is true , prehistoric people would have had to manoeuvre chunks of volcanic rock onto terraces built on the mountainside and stack them on top of each other to create a pyramid – a considerable feat of ancient engineering			0
dr @entity9 , a senior geologist at @entity27 ’s @entity99 , says that proof of the structure ’s organisation lies underground			1
his excavations have been backed by the @entity27 government , which recently decreed that the upper part of @entity23 is ' the largest megalithic structure in south - east @entity108 , ' the @entity103 reported			2
president @entity109 dubbed the dig a ‘ task of history … of important value to humanity			0
' and it has yielded some ancient artefacts			0
dr @entity9 said : ‘ people think the prehistoric age was primitive , but this monument proves that wrong			1
’ he believes such a pyramid would be proof of an advanced ancient civilisation in @entity121 and said that the majority of the stepped site is man - made , perhaps built by generations over a matter of centuries			1
the geologist is now working to establish the authenticity of the site			2
some rocks were originally stuck together with a form of ancient glue and have been carbon dated to be around 7,000 bc. dr @entity9 said that the ruins hide walls and rooms with steps and terraces below , which are evidence of a complex building			1

the structure is covered with massive rectangular stones of volcanic origin			0
it has been subjected to multiple geoelectric surveys , where ground penetrating radar and samples have been used			0
from this , he believes the terraced hill is 328 ft ( 100 metres ) thick and is made up of a number of layers			0
he said that so far man - made structures have been detected 49 ft ( 15 metres ) underground			1
experts dated rock between nine and 13 ft ( three and four metres ) below the surface as 6,500 years old and 12,500 years old below the surface			2
however , dr @entity9 ’s controversial findings are disputed and 34 @entity27 archaeologists and geologists have submitted a petition criticising the projects ’ methods and motives			1
they say that the excavation threatens the preservation of the site as it is and are annoyed at the prospect of involving civilian archaeologists in the excavation			2
volcanologist @entity192 believes that the structure is n’t a pyramid at all , but the neck of an old volcano and that the stones surveyed have been weathered by nature instead of being cut by humans			2
another anonymous expert is sceptical that such an ancient civilisation could have been advanced enough to build a pyramid so many thousands of years ago , when tools recovered from a nearby cave , dating to 7,000 @entity62 were very primitive			1
the terraces are bordered by retaining walls of stone ( pictured ) that can be accessed by 400 steps rising around 311 ft ( 95 metres )			0
they date to at least 5,000 bc			2

geologist claims the site in @entity11 could be 9,000 to 20,000 years old
dr @entity9 says man - made hillside hides a pyramid structure
tests have established parts of the structure date to 7,000 bc
could re-write pre-history , but other experts claim excavation is *flawed*
