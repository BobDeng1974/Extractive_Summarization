by @entity0 the teenage years are rarely easy for anyone but @entity2 , now 22 , from @entity3 , had a particularly difficult time			1
but it was n't because of bad boyfriends or bullying classmates : instead , aged 17 , doctors broke the devastating news that she had been born with an unusually shallow vagina and no womb , and as a result , and would never be able to bear children of her own			1
' the worst thing about the condition is how alone it can make you feel , ' says @entity2 , who is one of a small number of people to have @entity22			1
it ’s a lot to take in , especially at the age of 17 when you are full of hormones as it is			2
' the syndrome , which affects one in 5000 people , usually results in a missing uterus in female sufferers			1
difficult to detect , it was n't until @entity2 was 16 and still had n't begun her period that doctors realised that something might be wrong			1
' i had always suffered from a lot of medical issues , ' she explains			2
' i had one leg shorter than the other and i still has n't started my period at the age of 16			2
' most doctors just said to leave it and that [ the lack of periods ] was probably down to my other medical issues			2
so we left it until i was 17 and then we went back			2
' raising awareness : @entity2 appears on tonight 's episode of @entity62 to discuss her condition difficult : @entity2 says having the condition has severely affected her chances of having a normal relationship impossible : because of her condition , @entity2 will never be able to bear children except via a surrogate it took an ultrasound and a visit to a specialist consultant in @entity73 before the diagnosis was confirmed			1
' it was very difficult to come to terms with , ' she remembers			0
' it is a relatively unknown condition and not many doctors have even heard of it			0
' i was lucky in that i had a lovely nurse who put no pressure on me and was really supportive			0
other than her there is very little support out there other than perhaps the odd @entity87			0
it ’s a very isolating condition			0
' making matters worse was the impact it had on her intimate relationships , in particular with men , with an embarrassed @entity2 reluctant to reveal what was really wrong with her			1
' it has really affected my relationships , ' she says			0
' i put a barrier up around myself			0
my friends at school would start to get into relationships and would be talking about having sex and i would just nod along			0
' i did have a relationship that went really well when i was 19			0
he did n’t know about the condition but he knew that i could n’t have children			1
' in the end i ended it because i did n’t feel like it was fair on him , i could n’t deny a 22 year old man the chance to have sex and it got to the point when i just shut myself down			2
' but @entity2 , who appears on tonight 's episode of @entity62 , has begun to come to terms with the condition and is currently having treatment to enlarge her vagina and make sexual relationships possible			1
the treatment , called dilator therapy , involves gradually stretching the vagina over six months to a year and @entity2 says she is thrilled with how things are going			1
' i started doing the therapy in october last year up until about @entity126 and it was really good			0
but then it was a busy @entity126 and i fell off the wagon , ' she reveals			0
' it is really effective and it ’s fantastic that it requires no surgery but it is quite time consuming , and clinical			0
' although the treatment can not replace her missing uterus , women with @entity22 syndrome do have functioning ovaries and as a result can have biological children using a surrogate and @entity144			1
not that @entity2 is thinking about children just yet			1
' right now i am only 22 so i ’m not really thinking about kids , ' she says			2
' i have a friend with the condition who ’s 31 and it is really playing on her mind			0
right now for me , i ’m more concerned about having a normal relationship - i just tackle each problem as it comes			0
' @entity2 appears on @entity62 , tonight at 9pm on @entity154			1
for more information on @entity22 , see @entity156			1
