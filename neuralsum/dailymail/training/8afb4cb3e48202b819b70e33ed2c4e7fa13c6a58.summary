by @entity0 ever turned up to meet a @entity2 date and had to double take because your suitor looks nothing like their profile picture ? you 're not alone			1
a new survey has revealed that a third of online daters are disappointed when they meet up with their date , with 21 per cent describing them as ‘ unrecognisable ’			1
that 's a shame for the 48 per cent of @entity17 who have picked a dating partner purely on looks , only to endure an evening of boredom and awkward silences			1
not quite what you expected ? one in five online daters are ' unrecognisable ' in the flesh compared to their pictures , reveals a new survey however , this does n't come as much of a surprise when a quarter of brits are using profile pictures that are over five years old			2
and as for those natural selfies , all is not what it seems			0
women take five attempts on average to achieve the ‘ perfect selfie ’ for use on dating apps , and a quarter use @entity46 filters to boost their beauty			1
a little help from a @entity50 filter ? women take five attempts on average to achieve the ' perfect selfie ' - and a quarter use @entity46 filters to boost their beauty their efforts may well be going to waste because 67 per cent of men consider selfies a ‘ turn - off ’ and are less likely to strike up a conversation when someone posts a selfie			1
in a wider setting , 87 per cent have even gone as far as to block people from their social media feeds as they 're bored of seeing incessant selfies			0
however we ’re not totally looks obsessed : 56 per cent of people would rather receive a compliment on their personality than on their looks , found the survey by @entity72			1
dr @entity73 , a professor of @entity74 at @entity75 , said : ' dating has been trivialised by apps that focus too much on looks and too little on essential human qualities			0
wit and personality can be sexier than looks and unlike looks determines long - term compatibility			2
' research psychologist dr @entity85 agrees			0
' with the obsession of the selfie and digital narcissism , more and more focus is being placed on looks alone , ' she says			0
' we all want an attractive partner , of course , but what we need is someone who is psychologically compatible			0
' that 's awkward ! nearly half of @entity17 pick a dating partner purely on looks , only to endure an evening of boredom and awkward silences when they do n't turn out how they imagined			2

48 **%** pick a date based on looks
a quarter of women use @entity46 filters to boost their looks
56 **%** would rather receive a compliment on their personality than looks
