by @entity0 published : 19:41 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 07:52 est , 29 november 2013 the huge wealth of @entity3 and @entity4 meant that paying £ 1million a year in credit card bills for their five personal assistants was considered too ‘ trivial ’ to worry about , a court heard yesterday			1
yet when an accountant investigated he found two of the assistants had spent £ 685,000 on themselves in only four years			1
one of the pair spent more than £ 8,000 on designer clothes in a single day , had flown to @entity12 and back for almost £ 5,000 , and stayed at the @entity13 in @entity14			1
personal family assistants @entity19 , 41 , known as @entity35 , and her sister @entity20 , 35 , each deny a single charge of fraud at @entity21 in @entity38			1
@entity39 : @entity40 in @entity12 where @entity20 allegedly spent £ 613 on june 3 last year the pair , who live together in central @entity38 , are said to have spent wildly on restaurants , flights , and fashion , as well as taking out thousands in cash , on @entity47 credit cards given to them by the wealthy family			1
over four years up until june 2012 they allegedly spent a total of £ 685,000 on themselves			1
but mr @entity3 , and the financial team running the former advertising guru ’s modern art gallery and collection , and miss @entity4 – who has her own fortune of £ 20million – were so awash with cash it was only a chance occurrence that uncovered the @entity61 sisters ’ spending			0
it happened when the sisters ordered a taxi with a firm kept on account by mr @entity3 ’s art company @entity66 , and left it waiting for an age outside the family home			0
irritated by its beeping , 70 - year - old mr @entity3 made enquiries			2
he was shocked to discover it had been waiting to take one of his personal assistants to a polo match in @entity78			2
mr @entity3 ’s finance director at @entity66 , @entity80 , told the court that although he had noted @entity83 ’s credit card spending creeping up – with her monthly limit leaping from £ 25,000 to £ 100,000 – he had not yet thought to raise the matter			2
only when the taxi issue arose did he investigate properly and tell mr @entity87 that each month @entity20 was spending on average £ 48,000 and @entity35 £ 28,000			2
@entity88 : @entity20 spent £ 1,424 at @entity90 in @entity12 ( left ) in june last year , the court heard			1
she also used the credit card the same month to pay a £ 1,280 bill at the @entity13 hotel in @entity14 on the day she bought a @entity95 dress for £ 723 , it is alleged ' spending spree ' : @entity19 spent thousands of pounds on designer clothes from @entity98 at @entity99 ( left ) and @entity100 ( right ) , both in central @entity38 miss @entity4 was typically spending £ 7,000 , while three other assistants , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 , were on average spending £ 8,000 , £ 6,000 , and £ 3,000			1
those bills totalled £ 100,000 a month or £ 1.2million a year			2
mr @entity80 said of the massive credit card bills : ‘ it was on the back burner			2
we were dealing with more serious corporate matters and mr @entity3 and miss @entity4 normally did n’t have time for what we thought was trivial matters			0
’ it was , the court was told by prosecutor @entity116 , a tale of luxury goods and designer shops from a group of people living the type of ‘ high life ’ usually only seen ‘ portrayed in glossy magazines ’			1
yet even as the scale of the sisters ’ spending emerged , mr @entity80 investigated in a surprisingly informal way			0
credit card spending : @entity3 , 70 , arrives at @entity21 where he will give evidence against his two former @entity131 who are accused of spending £ 685,000 evidence : @entity3 is ushered into the court by security as he makes his way past press photographers yesterday appearance : mr @entity3 is seen arriving at @entity21 where he will today give evidence against @entity20 and @entity19 he told the court that he knew how close they were to the family – with @entity35 having worked for @entity142 for 14 years , originally as a nanny , and @entity20 for ten , at first as a housemaid – and did not want to upset them			1
so he met them in the kitchen of the large family home early last july to discuss their spending on the cards			0
he said he ran through the bills for the @entity47 cards they held in their own names , and detailed masses of expenditure which the women readily accepted had been for their personal benefit			0
mr @entity80 listed the sisters ’ personal expenditure in june last year alone			0
@entity20 had spent more than £ 4,700 on flights to @entity12 , where she spent £ 1,850 at high - end fashion store @entity163 and more than £ 2,000 on hotels			1
she also used the card to pay a £ 1,280 bill at the @entity13 hotel in @entity14 on the same day that she bought a @entity95 dress for £ 723			0
on june 12 she spent £ 5,385 at @entity169 , and £ 2,650 at designer store @entity170			1
departure : @entity3 leaves the court yesterday after being discharged by the judge			0
he will now give evidence tomorrow court hearing : mr @entity3 gets into a taxi outside @entity21 yesterday after being sent home for the day just half an hour after he arrived ' @entity179 ' : mr @entity3 's accountant said he did not tell the millionaire about the credit card spending earlier because he considered it a ' trivial ' matter @entity35 visited more high street shops and fewer high fashion boutiques than @entity20 – with @entity187 and @entity188 among them – but still managed to rack up almost £ 5,000 personal expenditure in the month , including cash withdrawals on her card			1
among other luxury brands the women blew thousands at @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and the @entity200 hotel group			0
but other personal assistants not charged with any offence also spent money – at @entity205 ’s nightclub , the @entity207 country venue and on @entity209 shoes			1
@entity210 , @entity211 , defending @entity35 , said of the @entity212 : ‘ they believed they were authorised to incur this personal expenditure			0
’ ' slavery ' : finance director @entity80 told @entity216 yesterday that @entity19 , 41 , complained that she was being treated worse than @entity218 slaves during conversations with her about credit card spending mr @entity80 said that at first both women talked of wanting to move on – but their tone changed when he asked the pair to sign letters admitting defrauding mr @entity3 and miss @entity4 , and promising to slowly pay it back while still working for them			2
it was said that @entity20 apparently turned against her employers through outrage that miss @entity4 had phoned the elite @entity38 private members club @entity230 and cancelled her membership			0
and the @entity212 were also said to be furious when one of the couple ’s children said they had heard the sisters had bought a house with money they stole from the family			0
the @entity212 deny buying any house with the cash			0
claims : tv cook @entity4 is expected to give evidence to the court next wednesday against her former employees thanks to supporters : as @entity29 was arriving at court today , @entity4 tweeted a recipe on @entity248 mr @entity210 told the court that the @entity61 sisters worked long hours for ‘ modest ’ salaries – £ 25,000 for @entity35 and £ 28,000 for her sister – and suggested it was common practice for assistants to be allowed to spend on themselves			1
he has told the court he plans to claim miss @entity4 allowed them to spend like crazy in return for them keeping quiet about her prolific drug abuse			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
