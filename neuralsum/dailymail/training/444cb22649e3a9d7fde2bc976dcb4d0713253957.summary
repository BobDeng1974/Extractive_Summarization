by @entity0 @entity3 's unique wildlife is under threat from an invasion of toxic toads , scientists have warned			1
researchers say the island 's native species face an ' ecological disaster ' caused by the arrival of @entity13 common toads			1
snakes feeding on the toads are especially at risk of poisoning , as are iconic @entity19 species such as lemurs and endemic birds			1
threat : @entity13 common toads , which are believed to have arrived in @entity3 on shipping containers , are poisonous to reptiles and animals if eaten it is thought the amphibians were transported to the @entity30 island in shipping containers from south - east @entity13			1
scientists say @entity3 could suffer a repeat of what happened in @entity35 when a relative of the poisonous amphibian , the cane toad , was introduced to control pests in 1935			2
they proceeded to devastate native animal populations and have spread across much of the country , defying attempts to eradicate them			0
the toads now number in their millions there			0
the @entity45 says around 95 per cent of @entity3 's reptiles and 92 per cent of its mammals exist nowhere else on @entity49			2
in a letter to @entity52 , 11 researchers warned that @entity13 common toads , or @entity54 , were spotted near @entity55 , @entity3 's largest seaport			1
ring tailed lemurs , which are found only on @entity3 , are already an endangered species , but now face an invasion of toxic frogs around 95 per cent of @entity3 's reptiles and 92 per cent of its mammals exist nowhere else on @entity49 the females can lay 40,000 eggs a month and it is feared they will take advantage of the ' ideal resources and climate ' to establish themselves			2
@entity68 , a wildlife health researcher at @entity70 in @entity35 , and his colleagues wrote : ' time is short , so we are issuing an urgent call to the conservation community and governments to prevent an ecological disaster			0
' a relative of the @entity13 common toad , the cane toad , was introduced to @entity35 in 1935 and devastated wildlife there he told @entity52 that iconic @entity19 species such as the cat - like fossa , lemurs and endemic birds could be threatened , because they are likely to eat the venomous toads			1
more than 50 species of endemic snake - including the ground boa - are also in jeopardy			0
the toads could also contaminate drinking water and transmit parasites to humans			0
the potential catastrophe is not just restricted to @entity3 , said mr @entity68			0
' there is now a high dispersal risk of these toads spreading from @entity3 to other @entity101 islands such as the @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 , ' he said			2
the 11 co-signatories of the letter are calling for an urgent hunting programme to wipe out the toads before they take hold - including draining ponds to stop their breeding .			0

scientists fear @entity13 common toads could decimate island 's wildlife
snakes feeding on the toads are especially at risk of poisoning
iconic species such as lemurs and endemic birds are also in danger
95 **%** of @entity3 's reptiles and 92 **%** of its mammals are unique
it is thought the toads arrived on the island in shipping containers
@entity35 's wildlife was devastated by a relative after it arrived in 1935
