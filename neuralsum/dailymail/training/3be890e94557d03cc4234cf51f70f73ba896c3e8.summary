by @entity1 reporter published : 15:18 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 18:22 est , 31 july 2012 accused : @entity2 , 57 , pictured in 2009 , has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife , @entity5 @entity2 's murder trial finally started today - with two very conflicting stories			1
prosecutors gave jurors an account that could have come from a 1940s pulp novel , in which a man does whatever he must — including murder — to keep his ex-wife 's hands off his money			0
on the other side , @entity2 's attorneys argued the former cop was a victim of something newer - a 24 - hour news cycle and cable tv 's talking heads , which together created a media frenzy that did not subside until prosecutors had charged an innocent man			1
@entity2 is charged with first - degree murder in the 2004 death of his third wife , @entity5			1
he is suspected but not charged in the 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity32			0
will @entity34 state 's attorney @entity33 told jurors that @entity2 , 58 , killed @entity36 , 40 , and made it look like an accident			1
' just weeks before her death , he told her he was going to kill her and she would not make it to a divorce settlement and would never get his pension , ' @entity33 said during opening statements			0
@entity2 's real - life drama inspired a tv movie and a national spotlight was put on the case , as many speculated whether @entity2 used his law - enforcement expertise to get away with @entity36 's murder and make 23 - year - old @entity32 vanish			1
in his opening statement , @entity2 's defense attorney , @entity52 , tried to knock down what will certainly be the prosecutors ' contention - that the investigation into @entity36 's death was a shoddy one			1
@entity52 told jurors that the @entity62 investigators were very experienced , and that the reason the state police conducted the investigation was because the @entity66 wanted to make sure there were no questions since @entity2 was one of their officers			1
@entity70 even said state police ' bagged ' @entity36 's hand to preserve any evidence			0
@entity52 said not one person — from police to prosecutors to @entity36 's own family — suggested @entity36 's death was anything other than an accident			0
grave charges : @entity2 is accused of murdering @entity5 , left			1
it was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub , right , but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide ' and the reason was because it was an accident , ' he said , adding that there was no sign of a struggle			0
' the bathroom was in perfect order , ' he said			0
' there is not one shred of evidence whatsoever that @entity2 or anybody else for that matter was in that house			1
why ? because this was a household accident , that 's why			0
' @entity102 slipped and fell in a household accident , case closed , ' @entity52 said			0
@entity52 also suggested that @entity2 was the victim of a ' media circus ' after @entity32 disappeared , triggered by the realization that @entity36 had died			1
@entity2 was charged in @entity36 's death after his much younger fourth wife vanished			1
@entity109 brought up @entity32 during the prosecution 's opening statements , making it clear her disappearance was the key to opening an investigation into @entity36 's death			0
@entity2 has denied wrongdoing in both cases			2
@entity33 also told the jury what has been widely known for years but what @entity33 has not said explicitly - there is no physical evidence linking @entity2 to @entity36 's death			1
a botched initial investigation into @entity36 's death leaves prosecutors with scant physical evidence			2
they 'll be forced to rely heavily on hearsay evidence — statements not heard directly by a witnesses — which is normally barred at trials , as well as circumstantial evidence to convince jurors of @entity2 's guilt			1
the first witness called today @entity36 's close friend and next - door neighbor @entity135			0
she cried as she was shown a picture of @entity36 lying lifeless in her bathtub before describing the moment she found her body in march 2004			0
mrs @entity135 told the court she and her husband @entity146 , their son @entity144 and another neighbor , @entity145 , entered the home late in the evening after @entity2 told her he could not get in touch with his ex-wife			2
earlier days : former @entity150 police sergeant @entity2 talks to the media as he leaves his home in @entity150 , @entity153 in 2007 in memoriam : flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of @entity5 , the third wife of @entity2 , at the @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity153 she recalled : ' i went into the bathroom , seen @entity5 in the tub and i ran out of the bathroom and threw myself on the floor and started screaming			1
' @entity2 checked @entity36 's pulse and when she asked if she was dead he replied : ' yes @entity135 , she is			2
' she said she noticed dried blood in @entity36 's hair and blood coming from her mouth , and she had bruises on her wrists and buttocks			0
mrs @entity135 said she offered to cover @entity36 with a towel ' because i did n't want people to see her like that			0
but he ( @entity2 ) said we were n't supposed to touch anything and we could n't do that			2
' the prosecution is expected to try and use statements that @entity32 made to her minister before she vanished in which she said that her husband had admitted to killing @entity36			0
while hearsay is usually barred , if the judge admits @entity32 ’s statements , the testimony could be damaging to @entity2 , according to @entity188 , a @entity189 attorney who has been following the case			1
distress : @entity194 and @entity36 , parents of @entity2 's third wife @entity5 , return to court as he stands trial for her murder ‘ what the judge is going to do is he 's going to wait and make individual rulings each time the prosecution tries to introduce hearsay , not give a blanket ruling , but listen to see if they open the door in some way that makes the hearsay admissible			1
he 'll make this a day by day ruling on these different pieces , ’ @entity188 told @entity198			0
‘ essentially we 've got @entity2 confessing the murder of @entity36 to his fourth wife , but we still have the question of whether that will come in			1
’ prosecutors will also try to admit @entity32 's statements to her minister that she saw @entity2 arrive home with women 's clothing around the time of @entity36 's death			1
@entity36 's sister may take the stand to describe @entity36 's statements that @entity2 threatened her with a knife and said he could make her death look like an accident			1
missing : @entity2 , right , is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity32 , right taken in : police lt. @entity231 , left , and a fellow investigator escort @entity2 , centre , into @entity233 state police headquarters in 2009 ‘ that does n't concern us , ’ @entity2 's attorney , @entity52 told @entity198 this week			2
‘ anybody that knows anybody that has been through a divorce knows that people say things and do things that is totally out of character , and clearly @entity102 was trying to build a case to try and get as much money as she could			0
’ the outcome of the trial may also hang on which forensic pathologist the seven men and five women on the jury will believe : @entity255 or @entity256			0
@entity255 , who investigated @entity36 ’s death in 2004 and ruled that a gash on her head and bruises on her body were consistent with an accidental fall , died earlier this year			0
the defense will likely call expert witnesses to testify that the woman ’s death was accidental			2
@entity256 , who investigated @entity36 's body after it was exhumed in 2007 , will testify for the prosecution at the trial about what made him switch the cause of death from an accidental fall to homicidal drowning			2
‘ first , they are not going to be able to say that ( the death investigation was botched ) because it was n't , ’ @entity2 's attorney said			2
‘ by saying that if they had done a better job in the investigation , then they would have been able to prosecute @entity2 , that lowers the burden of proof			2
where you do n't have evidence , you presume innocence			0
’ times past : @entity2 , pictured on his motorcycle two months before his indictment in 2009 , left , and right , with missing fourth wife @entity32			1

@entity2 , 57 , has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife , @entity5
trial finally *underway* today
jurors will hear evidence based on hearsay
publicity will be an issue in the case as the defense argue he is a victim of a media frenzy
