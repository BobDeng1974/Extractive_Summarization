@entity1 's highest court has upheld a ban on @entity3 using the word ' @entity5 ' to refer to their own god , ending a years - long legal battle			1
the verdict came in what was seen as a test case for the country 's wider @entity12 congregation , but officials insist the verdict is confined to one @entity17 newspaper			1
worshippers can still use ' @entity5 ' to refer to @entity20 in church , the government said			1
officials say the ruling applies only to that newspaper and not @entity32 in general a cyclist rides past @entity5 ( @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 on the day @entity1 's top court ruled that non-muslims can not use the word ' @entity5 ' to refer to @entity20 but the divisive case , in which the @entity3 challenged a ban on its appropriation of the @entity44 word , comes as minorities claim their rights are under threat from creeping @entity48 in @entity1			1
the government had previously banned the use of ' @entity5 ' in the local @entity52 edition of the @entity3 's @entity54 newspaper			1
the use of the word had angered @entity24 , who say @entity32 are overstepping religious boundaries			0
a seven - judge panel in @entity1 's administrative capital @entity61 yesterday upheld a lower court decision which sided with the government 's ban			2
but a government spokesman later clarified : ' the ruling only applies to the @entity54 newspaper 's use of the word " @entity5 "			1
@entity1 @entity32 can still use the word " @entity5 " in church			1

' the @entity12 community continues to have the right to use the word " @entity5 " in our bibles , church services and @entity12 gatherings , ' said @entity78 , chairman of the @entity79			1
lawyers for the @entity3 said they would explore new ways to challenge the ban			2

earlier , they had shouted ' @entity100 ' ( @entity20 is great ) and waved banners that read , ' uniting to defend the name of @entity5 '			2
' we must defend @entity5 because this is our religious obligation			2
i hope other communities , including @entity32 , understand this , ' @entity105 , head of @entity106 , told @entity110			0
the dispute first erupted in 2007 when @entity1 's home ministry threatened to revoke the @entity54 's publishing permit for using the @entity44 word in its malay - language edition			2
the @entity3 launched a court case to challenge the directive , arguing that ' @entity5 ' had been used for centuries in @entity119 and other literature to refer to ' @entity20 ' outside of @entity121			1
but authorities argued that using ' @entity5 ' in @entity124 literature could confuse @entity24 and entice them to convert - a crime in @entity1			1
a @entity24 man wears a shirt that leaves his opinion in no doubt as he and fellow protesters await the verdict in 2009 a court ruled in favour of the @entity3 , sparking a spate of attacks on houses of worship			0

minorities have long resented a decades - old positive discrimination policy which favours @entity164 in education , housing and employment			0
prime minister @entity168 , who took office in 2009 , has increasingly rolled back his initial reformist and conciliatory rhetoric in a bid to please hardliners of his @entity174 , which has ruled the country virtually uninterrupted since independence in 1957			0
' the idea is to use this as a political weapon to raise tensions , ' @entity177 , a political science professor at @entity178 , told @entity110			0
' they ( the ruling party ) feel that this is a vote - winner for the next election			0
