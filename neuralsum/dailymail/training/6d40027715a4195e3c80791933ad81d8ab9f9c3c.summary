the country has enough fissile material for a dozen nuclear bombs			2
it sells missile technology to rogue regimes such as @entity6 and @entity7			0
and the three generations of the @entity10 dynasty who have run it since 1945 have all been ruthless , brutal — and terrifyingly erratic			0
at 9.49 local time on wednesday , @entity14 ’s isolated regime defied warnings from across the world to launch an @entity18 ballistic rocket from a remote village near the @entity21 border with @entity22			1
the launch site is 45 miles from @entity14 ’s main nuclear complex at @entity25 , where scientists are working towards the production of long - range missiles which can carry nuclear warheads			1
he is known as @entity36 and it is said his face has been surgically altered to resemble his grandfather , @entity38 , the first ruler of @entity14 @entity14 state media reported the launch as the successful positioning of a weather satellite in space			1
@entity44 showed images of happy people dancing in the streets			2
customers in a coffee shop in the capital @entity51 burst into applause			0
it was a case of fourth - time lucky for the country , since three previous launch attempts had ended in failure			2
the most recent flop occurred eight months ago and was particularly embarrassing because it had been timed to coincide with the centenary of the birth of @entity38 , the first ruler of @entity14 , a man so revered he is called the eternal president even though he died in 1994			1
his embalmed body can be reached on travelators that take respectful visitors through the vast @entity66 to bow before it and weep			0
in that year power passed to his son @entity68 , still called the @entity70 , who was succeeded in 2011 amid weeks of hysterical compulsory mourning by @entity32 , at 29 the world ’s youngest leader			1
lift off : the @entity18 ballistic rocket was launched at 9.49 local time on wednesday at @entity14 's general launch command centre			1
state media reported the launch as the successful positioning of a weather satellite in space blast off : a screen shows the @entity18 ( @entity83 3 ) rocket being launched from a launch pad at the @entity14 's @entity85 celebrate success : female members of a @entity88 perform at the launch celebration and @entity44 showed images of happy people dancing in the streets and others bursting into applause @entity32 is known as @entity36 , and it is said his face has been surgically altered to resemble that of his grandfather			1
but while his people were shown on state media celebrating , @entity14 ’s neighbours were deeply alarmed by the so - called satellite launch , for it was nothing less than a test for ballistic missiles intended to be equipped with nuclear warheads			1
@entity107 's foreign secretary @entity106 summoned the @entity14 ambassador for an explanation following ' clear violation ' of @entity112 resolutions it represents yet another step in the country ’s determination to be able to launch a nuclear strike on cities on @entity120 ’s @entity119 — and it demonstrates @entity32 ’s megalomanic contempt for international relations			1
as the rocket flew south across the @entity125 and @entity126 , its discarded booster sections fell near the @entity127 and the @entity129 island of @entity130 , violating both countries ’ sovereign territory			2
@entity134 satellites monitored the rocket ’s ascent , as did three of its @entity138 warships from the sea			2
@entity129 put its armed forces on alert and held a news conference within 30 minutes of the launch to calm a panicky population			2
even @entity22 , @entity14 ’s closest ally , said it regretted @entity51 ’s violation of @entity112 bans on ballistic missile technology to launch a satellite			1
in @entity148 , foreign secretary @entity106 summoned the @entity14 ambassador to the @entity150 for an explanation following ‘ clear violation ’ of @entity112 resolutions			1
predictably , @entity32 remains unrepentant			1
his accession last year led in the @entity155 to naive optimism — of the sort @entity158 once invested in @entity7 ’s murderous @entity159 , who had taken over from his despotic father — that the young prince would be a reformer			1
nothing could be further from reality			0
true , @entity32 appears not to have his father ’s depraved sexual appetite			1
@entity68 was attended by a retinue of 2,000 young women known as @entity169 in @entity14 , meaning @entity170 , who had been rounded up at the age of 15 by officials to service the @entity70 ’s sexual whims			1
all had to be virgins , and none could be more than 5ft 2in — the height of @entity178 himself			0
in contrast , @entity32 is said to be a romantic and deeply attached to his pretty wife , @entity182 , who likes @entity184 handbags and high hemlines in a country where individual self - expression is all but forbidden			1
pubic announcement : an anchorwoman announcing the country 's successful rocket launch in a tv program in @entity51 , @entity14 rejoice : @entity14 dance to celebrate their country 's rocket launch @entity195 alarmed : a protest mock up of @entity14 's missile is extinguished by police in @entity134 after the launch which was nothing less than a test for ballistic missiles intended to be equipped with nuclear warheads @entity10 also appears more westernised than his father			1
a photo that appeared soon after his succession caught him cavorting on a rollercoaster with the @entity107 ambassador to his country			0
he likes basketball and @entity211 whisky , and he attended school in @entity213 for a couple of years in the 1990s			0
but he also spent three years at a training school for elite @entity217 cadres in @entity51 , and the fact is that the podgy young dictator has moved quickly to consolidate his grip on power			0
any challenge to his might would most likely come from the armed forces , so as soon as he was leader he immediately promoted himself from general to marshal and liquidated any potential dissenters			2
a deputy defence minister and other senior officers were assassinated with pinpoint mortar fire after @entity10 insisted nothing should remain of them , ‘ down to their hair ’			0
the military are part of @entity14 ’s privileged elite , who belong to the ruling single party			1
they are known as the ‘ core class ’ , and number a quarter of the population			0
the most privileged of all are the @entity241 themselves , with gilded luxury residences , replete with bowling alleys , cinemas and heated swimming pools			2
remains unrepentant : @entity32 's accession last year led in the @entity155 to naive optimism that the young prince would be a reformer			1
nothing could be further from the truth romantic : @entity32 is said to be deeply attached to his pretty wife , @entity182 , who likes @entity184 handbags and high hemlines in a country where individual self - expression is all but forbidden more than half the population of 23 million are not so fortunate as they are classed as ‘ waverers ’ , ordinary people outside the charmed party circle			1
while still at school they have to complete detailed biographical sketches of their families , which are then used by the state to determine everything from food rations and housing to careers			2
the final class of people are categorised as ‘ hostile ’			0
these are the children of the intelligentsia such as doctors , christian ministers , merchants or lawyers			2
they are taken from their families and forced to live in barren regions of the country near @entity22 where it is cold , windy and mountainous			0
the hostiles constitute 20 per cent of the population in what must be the most class - stratified society on earth			0
@entity14 is a totalitarian dictatorship where loudspeakers pump out propaganda on the streets and in factories and mines			1
it practises total surveillance , with the spies being spied on by other spies			0
anyone who falls foul of the regime — and sins range from listening to @entity134 radio stations and failing to praise the leader sufficiently , to attempting flight to @entity22 in order to avoid starvation — is put in one of the country ’s six vast prison camps that house 200,000 people			1
and it ’s not just the offender who suffers			0
the regime practices inter-generational punishment			0
this means that his or her parents and offspring are incarcerated too , often for their entire lives			1
@entity323 passed to son : @entity14 soldiers mourn @entity68 , known as the @entity70 , among weeks of hysterical compulsory mourning last year these camps are huge complexes , sometimes as large as @entity329 in extent , except that they are surrounded by electric fences and watchtowers			1
inmates toil in mines from before dawn to dusk , and then have to sit through indoctrination sessions where they are often beaten for real or imaginary infractions of rules that are only known to the guards			0
a place in college is awarded to any guard who shoots dead anyone trying to escape			2
executions and torture are rife			0
rare accounts from defectors have mentioned specially - trained dogs being set on prisoners to maul them to death			0
there even have been horrifying accounts of female prisoners being routinely raped by guards and the foetuses that result being cut from their wombs			0
numbers in the prisons are also kept down through natural attrition — the heavy manual work often proves fatal on a diet so inadequate that those who manage to supplement it with insects or rat meat are considered highly fortunate			0
unsurprisingly , @entity14 ’s economy is moribund and its agriculture disastrous			1
during the @entity370 , the country was a million tons short of rice and cereal grains annually , and anywhere between a million and three million people starved to death			0
deadly game of extortion : @entity32 manages to fund the fourth largest army in the world with one million troops on the @entity134 border alone yet @entity32 manages to fund the fourth largest army in the world , with one million troops on the @entity134 border alone , and 13,000 artillery pieces that could rain chemical shells as well as high explosives on @entity385 to the @entity134			2
his regime regularly sinks ships that sail too close to islands in disputed waters			0
sometimes it shells these islands too , killing @entity134 soldiers and civilians			0
by indulging in his military escapades , @entity32 is practising a deadly game of extortion — and one which until now has proved successful			1
invariably either @entity134 or the @entity120 have responded by trying to appease the regime with the shipments of supplies it needs to feed its starving population			2
but as @entity32 moves ever closer to being able to brandish nuclear weapons , the stakes are raised higher and higher			2
and one day this monstrous rogue , isolated from reality by his cowering people and fawning court of generals , may provoke a military response from his neighbours the consequences of which do not bear thinking about			0
@entity413 is author of blood and rage : a @entity416 .			0

@entity14 's launch of a ballistic rocket showed plan to attack @entity120
but state media said launch as successful positioning of weather satellite
' @entity427 ' leader @entity32 has megalomaniac designs on @entity155
he lives in gilded *palaces* while poor are kept in camps the size of @entity329
parents and children incarcerated together and shot if they try to escape
