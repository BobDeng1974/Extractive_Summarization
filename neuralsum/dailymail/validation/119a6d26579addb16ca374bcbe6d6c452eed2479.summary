inevitably , it all kicked off in the end			2
three games in two competitions over 10 days has forged some barely disguised contempt between @entity5 and @entity6			1
six red cards tell their own tale			2
for @entity12 ’s team , the frustration — and indiscipline — is growing			2
@entity13 became the fourth @entity6 player to see red in the dying minutes , seconds after @entity5 ’s @entity16 was dismissed for a retaliatory kick at @entity18			1
afterwards , @entity19 rounded on the @entity20 , claiming he could have injured substitute @entity21 ‘ for life ’			2
the open wounds enveloping this fixture are now there for all to see			0
@entity26 ( left ) celebrates with his team - mates as @entity5 comfortably progressed on wednesday @entity5 manager @entity19 celebrates at full - time as his side reached the @entity31 semi-finals @entity16 ( second left ) comes together with @entity13 in the second half @entity5 : @entity33 , @entity34 ( @entity35 72 ) , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , commons ( @entity21 80 ) , @entity16 , @entity43 ( @entity44 58 ) subs not used : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 goal : @entity36 17 , @entity43 57 , @entity42 79 , @entity37 90 sent off : @entity16 booked : @entity34 , @entity38 , @entity44 @entity51 united : @entity52 , @entity13 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity57 74 ) , @entity18 , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 70 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 70 ) , @entity63 subs not used : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67			1
spark sent off : @entity13 booked : @entity52 , @entity55 , @entity63 referee : @entity70 it is hard to see who will stop @entity74 ’s champions now			1
@entity6 will have a fourth attempt in the @entity76 this weekend			0
yet after losing the @entity78 and crashing out of the @entity31 in this quarter - final replay , that prospect holds all the appeal of a cold - meat buffet with @entity82			1
@entity83 will make all the right noises before a @entity31 semi-final at @entity86			1
aberdeen believe their title aspirations are alive and well			0
yet , @entity5 are developing a habit of wrapping themselves around opponents and squeezing tight			1
for @entity19 , the fourth domestic treble in this old club ’s history is edging over the horizon			0
@entity36 ’s 17th - minute headed goal was the platform for @entity43 to add a second on 57 minutes			1
@entity42 thrashed the third high into the net 12 minutes from time before @entity26 tapped in from close range in the final moments			1
by then , things threatened to run out of control			0
@entity16 had taken a kick at @entity104 and witnessed the flash of red			1
the crowd bayed for retribution against @entity13 seconds later and were duly obliged by referee @entity70			1
in a freakish run of three consecutive meetings , @entity6 have now scored one , losing six			2
they return to @entity112 at the weekend a punch - drunk team blighted by suspensions , with former players @entity115 , @entity117 likely to return to the @entity5 fray			1
it ’s hardly a prospect to savour			0
@entity19 ’s team began the game with a flourish and kept going			0
@entity124 , the @entity6 striker spared further punishment for a kick to the face of @entity40 in the first game , felt the @entity5 skipper ’s robust retribution in all of six seconds			1
it was a forerunner for what was to come			0
for one heart - stopping moment in only the second minute , the visitors feared they might witness their latest red card in this fixture when keeper @entity52 raced from his line to clatter @entity43 as he hared on to a superb commons through ball			1
@entity43 had already lost control , the goalscoring opportunity gone			1
referee @entity70 — rightly — contented himself with a yellow card			0
he would have the chance to flex his muscles later			0
@entity36 ( centre ) rises above the @entity6 defence to score the opener for the hosts @entity36 celebrates after putting @entity5 1 - 0 up in the @entity31 quarter - final @entity12 reshaped his defence in the absence of suspended duo @entity155 and @entity156 , fielding midfielder @entity55 as a makeshift , emergency left - back			1
the midfielder suffered a form of torture here			0
it made for painful viewing			0
@entity41 — finally free of injury and a scorer in last sunday ’s @entity78 triumph — used his pace to offer @entity5 width and speed			1
even so , the home team had just one goal to show for 45 minutes of dominance at the interval			0
it came from a @entity58 foul on @entity42 midway inside the @entity6 half			1
@entity16 — an improved performer since his recent disciplinary faux pas — floated the ball into a crowded area , @entity36 planting a firm , looping header beyond @entity52 for his fifth of the season			1
at @entity86 , @entity5 were loathe to build on their lead and possession			1
so it was here again			0
a commons corner picked out @entity26 , the @entity190 ’s firm header surging over the bar			2
@entity5 's @entity43 ( right ) is airborne as he puts his side 2 - 0 in front against @entity6 @entity43 gives a salute as he slides across the @entity196 pitch in celebration taunting and tormenting @entity55 , @entity41 then came close to scoring by accident			1
putting his head down and surging for the byeline , his attempted cross dropped under the bar and was heading into the net until @entity52 tipped over at the last			0
another opportunity was passed up before half - time , a sclaffed @entity52 kick out to @entity39 prompting a rare loss of composure in the usually unflappable @entity208			0
he had the chance to shoot , but opted to take on @entity54 instead and lost the ball			0
@entity6 ’s resistance was sporadic			0
they came close in 32 minutes after an outstanding incursion down the right flank by @entity13			2
the @entity20 made it unchecked from his own half to the @entity5 byeline , his low centre aimed at @entity63 before @entity5 keeper @entity33 managed — unconvincingly — to get a hand on the ball			2
@entity42 ( second left ) scores @entity5 's third goal of the evening at their home ground commons celebrates as @entity5 go three up against @entity6 in the cup @entity226 , in that way of his , casually walked the ball clear from under his own crossbar			1
@entity5 then began the second period in a ragged , loose fashion and that allowed the visitors their best spell of the game			2
in the opening five minutes , @entity6 summoned more attacking menace than they had managed in the entire first 45			0
@entity124 ’s low , right - foot shot was pushed up in the air by @entity33 as he retrieved another piercing ball across the face of goal from @entity13			2
but it did n’t last long			0
until the 57th minute to be precise			0
@entity5 scored with virtually their first effort on goal in the second period , @entity43 cleverly guiding a quite superb long ball from @entity40 past @entity52 with a first - time effort from 12 yards			1
the outcome was placed beyond doubt 11 minutes from time			0
commons blew a fine chance after a flowing passing move involving @entity35 , @entity39 and a @entity16 cut - back			2
last season ’s @entity252 — a scorer at @entity86 last sunday — dallied too long			0
@entity5 's @entity16 speaks with referee @entity70 before he is sent off @entity5 's @entity44 ( second right ) shows his fury as he comes together with @entity13 @entity13 is sent off by referee @entity70 as both sides end the match with 10 men @entity37 scores with a tap - in late on to cap a successful night for the home side but within seconds he atoned , playing a deft one - two with substitute @entity44 before slamming the ball high into the net for 3 - 0			1
what came next was regrettable , but predictable			0
two teams sick of the sight of each other began settling scores			0
@entity16 took a blow to the mouth , drawing blood , and the @entity273 took swift revenge as he lay on the deck			2
within moments , the scores were evened up when @entity13 ’s crude lunge at substitute @entity21 sparked a melee at the corner flag			2
the former @entity282 player went off after what @entity19 described as a ‘ stupid ’ challenge — with some verbals between the two as he left the pitch			0
and @entity19 ’s players had the last word when @entity26 tapped in @entity36 ’s simple cut back from close range .			1

@entity5 comfortably progressed to the @entity31 semi-finals
@entity36 , @entity43 , @entity42 and @entity26 all scored for the hosts at @entity196
both sides ended with 10 men as @entity16 and @entity13 were sent off
