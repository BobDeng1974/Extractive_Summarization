four @entity1 people found in caves in @entity3 could be a entirely new species of humanoid - and the discovery ' opens a new chapter ' in the history of evolution , say archaeologists			2
the fossils , found in two caves , belong to a previously unknown @entity1 people and have a ' highly unusual ' mixture of ancient and modern features			1
named the ' @entity18 people ' because of the animals they hunted and dating from between 14,500 to 11,500 years ago , they are the youngest humanoid fossils to be found in @entity20			1
previously it had been thought that early humans had little competition in the continent			2
four mystery cavemen dug up in @entity3 could be a new species of humanoid , scientists say			0
the fossils , found in two caves , belong to a previously unknown @entity1 people one of the skulls found in ' @entity31 ' in china - researchers say that the skulls have a mixture of ancient and modern features the ' @entity18 ' discovery has ‘ startling implications for the early peopling of @entity20 ’ , said professor @entity38 , of the @entity39			1
they would have shared the land with modern looking humans at a time when @entity3 's earliest farming culture was beginning , he said			0
writing in journal @entity45 , prof @entity38 explained : ‘ these new fossils might be of a previously unknown species , one that survived until the very end of the @entity50 around 11,000 years ago			1
he said : ‘ the discovery of the red - deer people opens the next chapter in the human evolutionary story - the @entity20 chapter - and it 's a story that 's just beginning to be told			1
’ ‘ alternatively , they might represent a very early and previously unknown migration of modern humans out of @entity59 , a population who may not have contributed genetically to living people			1
’ three sets of remains were found at @entity64 - @entity31 ' - in the @entity66 province in 1989			0
they were unstudied until 2008			0
analysis of skulls in the ' @entity18 ' cave in @entity3 hints that the people might be a new species of humanoid early humans in the @entity76 series @entity77 : the ' @entity18 ' people could have come from an early - and undocumented - migration of humans from @entity59 a fourth was found in 1979 a cave near the village on @entity83 in neighbouring @entity85 province			1
it was encased in rock until 2009			0
the skulls and teeth from both finds are very similar to each other and show an unusual mixture of archaic and modern anatomical features , as well as previously unseen characteristics			1
scientists have named them ' red deer people ' because evidence suggests that they hunted extinct red deer and cooked them in the @entity64 cave			1
until the discovery , no fossils younger than 100,000 years old had been found in mainland east @entity20 other than those of our own species , @entity104			2
this suggested that @entity104 had the run of the area which was devoid of our evolutionary ancestors once the first humans appeared			0
but the new find suggests this may not have been the case			0
professor @entity118 , of the @entity119 and @entity120 , said : ‘ because of the geographical diversity caused by the @entity122 , south - west @entity3 is well known as a biodiversity hotspot and for its great cultural diversity			0
‘ that diversity extends well back in time			0
’ in the last ten years scientists have discovered the enigmatic ' @entity128 ' fossil in @entity20 as well as evidence modern humans interbred with ancient @entity130 , a species from @entity132			2
the latest find shows there is more to learn from the continent , said prof @entity38 .			0

' red deer people ' lived 14,500 - 11,500 years ago in @entity20
previously thought that homo *sapiens* had continent to themselves
' highly unusual ' mixture of ancient and modern - could be new species
could also be relic of early migration out of @entity59 which died out
