a mother - of - two says having a baby saved her life because she found a lump in her breast while breastfeeding			1
@entity5 , 37 , noticed a fast - growing lump in her breast five months after her son @entity7 was born			1
initially , she suspected it was simply a blocked milk duct and did n’t consider the possibility it could be a tumour , even when her gp suggested screening as a precaution			1
@entity5 , 37 , was diagnosed with breast cancer after finding a lump while breastfeeding her son , @entity7 but mrs @entity5 , from @entity16 , received the devastating diagnosis after being referred to a specialist breast cancer centre			1
the communications manager , who has now made a full recovery , said : ‘ i feel really lucky because doctors think there was a very good chance i had the cancer while i was pregnant			2
‘ obviously it was a massive shock			0
it ’s overwhelming to think that if it was n’t for @entity7 , it might not have been caught so quickly and it might have been too late for me			2
‘ i was petrified , thinking how am i going to look after my children while dealing with cancer ? ’ it ’s natural that you fear the worst			2
’ after the joy of giving birth to @entity7 , now two , the cancer diagnosis came as a terrible shock to mrs @entity5 , husband @entity36 and their daughter @entity37 , five			1
doctors at @entity16 ’s @entity40 suspected that hormones had accelerated the tumour ’s growth , making it bigger but easier to detect			2
mrs @entity5 ( pictured with her husband , @entity36 , son , @entity7 , and daughter , @entity37 ) had to have chemotherapy , radiotherapy and surgery before she was given the all - clear the diagnosis forced mrs @entity5 to stop breastfeeding while she underwent a series of tests before starting her treatment			1
and she had to leave her family for 24 hours to protect the children from the possibility of radiation after being injected with a special dye to see if the cancer had spread			2
she said : ‘ five months after giving birth to my baby boy , we found ourselves in a small consulting room hearing the life - changing news that i would begin chemotherapy in less than two weeks			1
‘ it sounds really melodramatic , but having to stay that night at my parents ’ house before finding out if it had spread was definitely the hardest part			0
a lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast			2
a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts			0
discharge from either nipple or a lump or swelling in either armpit			2
dimpling on the skin of the breasts or a rash on or around the nipple			0
source : @entity92 ‘ i ended up having to turn all of the photos of the kids face down because it was just so heart - breaking			2
‘ you almost feel like you have let them down , which i know is stupid			0
i was worrying what they were going to do if the worse - case scenario happened			0
’ within a fortnight , mrs @entity5 was on a trial of a strong chemotherapy drug , which caused her immune system to weaken and her hair to fall out			1
but the morning after her first session , the family were shattered by more misfortune when mr @entity111 was knocked off his bike in a hit - and - run incident			0
the accident left him on crutches with mrs @entity5 having to take up the role of childcare - all while suffering the ill - effects of chemotherapy			1
she said : ‘ it was just ridiculous - our family truly have been through hell and back			0
at that point i remember thinking “ how could things get any worse ? ” ’ despite mrs @entity5 ’s early treatment , the tumour continued to grow , and she had a lumpectomy before she continued with chemotherapy			1
she was put through daily radiotherapy for five weeks early in 2013 before being given the all - clear a year ago			1
health professionals recommend that she remained on medication to suppress her levels of oestrogen , a hormone known to encourage growth in some breast cancers			0
mrs @entity5 ( pictured with @entity7 ) says she believes the cancer would n't have been diagnosed so early if she had n't been breastfeeding and credits @entity7 with saving her life she will go through the menopause early , leaving her unable to have more children			1
but the mother - of - two said it was a price that she was more than willing to pay for the chance of a long life with her family			0
she said : ‘ @entity147 made me a lot more aware than i ’d usually be and probably helped me to notice sooner that i had quite a big lump			0
‘ i ’m just so glad i got it checked or there could have been a very different outcome			0
‘ the kids have both been amazing and - with mine and @entity36 ’s family - they have all really helped me through a tough time			0
‘ i ’m just so happy to be at the other end and be all - clear from cancer now			1
i know not everyone ’s as lucky as me but it may not always be the worse - case scenario			0
‘ i want people to know that you can get over this and there ’s so much support out there			0
’ @entity168 , director of the @entity169 , said mrs @entity5 ’s story showed how important it was for health professionals not to be complacent with changes to women ’s breasts when lactating			1
she said : ‘ we have to be careful that we do n’t assume that every lump and bump women have is a blocked milk duct			1
‘ it ’s absolutely the right route that everyone ’s taken here - if there ’s anything suspicious at all , do n’t make an assumption , make sure it gets checked out			0

@entity5 found a lump when her son , @entity7 , was five months old
she assumed it was a blocked milk duct but tests showed it was a tumour
she had chemotherapy , radiotherapy and surgery as she *battled* the cancer
mrs @entity5 has now been given the all - clear
