by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 13 july 2013 updated : 19:58 est , 13 july 2013 doing an about - turn on his own pet policy @entity4 mayor @entity3 is now not so keen on the idea of the ' @entity9 ' airport			1
the new transport hub was going to be built in the @entity11 on an artificial island			1
now mr @entity3 is more strongly backing a giant airport on the @entity14 in @entity15 , partly built on reclaimed land			1
new favourite idea : @entity3 has backed the four - runway ' @entity18 ' ( pictured ) in the @entity11 airport , which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers a year on the @entity14 in @entity15 elaborate plan : the @entity14 's proposed international railway station , which would include a service to @entity26 in 26 minutes mr @entity3 told @entity27 in an interview that it would ' knock the spots off ' rival @entity31 airports as it would eventually serve 180 million passengers a year			1
the entire project would cost about Â£ 65 billion , including a new train line taking passengers to @entity26 in 26 minutes			0
the @entity9 plan , designed by @entity39 firm @entity37 , will remain one of three options that mr @entity3 will present to a government - backed commission this week			1
the proposed location for @entity9 , artificially created from landfill , would be two miles north of the @entity46			2
ferries would link the site to @entity15 and @entity49 while a railway bridge could connect it to the mainland			0
the third possible idea would be expanding @entity53			0
crunch time : mayor of london @entity3 is submitting the @entity14 plan to a government - backed commission today however , mr @entity3 now says that the @entity14 plan has the ' greatest single potential for regeneration '			1
the blueprint involves an opening scheduled for 2029 , requiring infrastructure improvements such as extending @entity63 and widening the @entity65 an extra lane in each direction for 36 miles			0
mr @entity3 insisted that prime minister @entity67 is ' open to the idea ' of an estuary airport			2
on top of those three suggestions , @entity70 will be revealing its own plans to expand with a thrid and maybe even fourth runway			0
ongoing fight : a longstanding campaign has been fought to prevent a third @entity70 runway , but if airports move to the east of the @entity4 , tens of thousands will lose their jobs the plans to replace @entity70 have angered many west @entity84 who fear it would harm the local economy and result in huge job loses as around 76,600 people currently work there			0
the committee listening to the various ideas , chaired by former @entity93 chairman sir @entity92 , will not publish its final report until the summer of 2015			0
in april , mr @entity3 said that he would also like to see any future airport named after the @entity96 .			2

mayor @entity3 does a *u-turn* on his own plan for ' @entity9 ' airport
the new airport would have been on an artificial island in the @entity11
now mr @entity3 favours a giant airport on the @entity14 in @entity15
