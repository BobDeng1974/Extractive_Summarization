by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 everybody has their memories of the @entity5 final of 2010 and not all of them are good			1
@entity8 referee @entity7 has since described it as one of the worst nights of his career and just this week @entity14 ’s @entity13 described that sapping night in @entity15 as the time he hit rock bottom			1
it was that kind of game			2
ugly , boring , disappointing			2
circle of life : @entity21 's players train before their match with @entity14 and they will hope to show tiki - taka is n't dead for @entity21 , though , it signalled the scaling of the ultimate summit , as well as a vindication of a style of football born on the fields of @entity33 ’s @entity32 training ground and then moved forward by national team coach @entity34			1
four years on and @entity21 arrived on @entity36 ’s north - east coast on thursday banging the drum for the same principles			2
for the world champions there really is only one way to play			1
on friday they face @entity14 again in the opening fixture of @entity44 hoping only to enhance their legacy			1
speaking at the pre-match press conference at the @entity49 , @entity33 playmaker @entity47 said : ‘ our philosophy is very clear			1
we want to dominate games by keeping possession			1
‘ we have had this philosophy for years and had great success			2
we are going to win or die with this style			0
we want to make history again playing this way			0
’ we have lift - off : @entity60 ( centre ) jumps during a @entity21 training drill one of the most attractive games of the opening stages — along with @entity65 against @entity66 and @entity67 versus @entity68 — it is perhaps a shame that it has been cast as @entity44 ’s opener			1
avoiding defeat will be uppermost in the minds of @entity34 and @entity14 ’s @entity74 but the @entity75 begin this @entity5 knowing that to everybody else at least they have a little something to prove			1
@entity21 ’s tiki - taka style often brings derision from those around the world incapable of playing it			1
once again , many will be willing @entity21 to fail , perhaps taking heart from @entity33 ’s struggles this season			0
to @entity34 , though , his team and their style is all that matters			1
the rest is just noise			0
‘ @entity33 is a football club in @entity21 , ’ he said , when asked if @entity33 ’s problems would have damaging consequences in @entity36			0
‘ the national squad is totally separate			0
anyway , we have seen this year how @entity75 club football is dominant			0
‘ there were two @entity75 clubs in the @entity101 final and another won the @entity102			2
we draw our players from these clubs but that ’s where the relationship ends			0
’ talking a good game : @entity47 ( left ) said @entity21 will play the only way they know how - keeping possession while the @entity111 squad has changed vastly from four years ago , @entity34 still relies on @entity33 ’s @entity47 , @entity112 and @entity113			1
are we approaching the end of an era for @entity75 football ? ‘ we hope that wo n’t happen , ’ added @entity34			1
‘ we have an under 21 squad that won the @entity120			2
we have 30 per cent new players in the squad compared to last time			0
i am not afraid of the future			0
’ @entity21 ’s qualifying record was excellent , even if goals were at times hard to find , and he knows he wo n’t face a @entity111 team with the same brutal approach as @entity130 ’s players in 2010			1
‘ i ca n’t criticise them for that now , ’ @entity34 said			1
‘ @entity74 has worked in @entity21 and i hold him in high regard			1
‘ he is a great manager and he has retained the essence of true @entity111 football in this squad			0
’ ugly , boring , disappointing : let 's hope this match is better than the 2010 @entity5 final @entity140 has more history in @entity21 than some may realise			1
as well as managing @entity33 from 1997 - 2000 and 2002 - 2003 , he was also responsible for the creation of @entity32 and gave players such as @entity47 their first experience of top - level football			1
‘ i have an extraordinary memory of him , ’ recalled @entity47			1
‘ he was basically the first coach i ever had			2
i owe him and i am very fond of him			0
‘ he was just marvellous with me and he believed in me 100 per cent			0
’ on friday night on the @entity152 coast , master meets pupils once again			0
many believe they may be past their best			0
i ’ve been waiting to see a top international team play with three at the back and i ’m not surprised it ’s the @entity111 who are experimenting			1
it ’s not an easy system but the squad has had time to work on it			0
it only works if the two wider men play like full backs			2
it ’s up to @entity169 and @entity170 to move across and cover the shaded area ( right ) behind their flying wing backs			0
@entity174 will almost play like a striker			2
free of any defensive responsibility , he can terrorise the @entity75 defence			0
this game could dictate the shape of the draw			0
the loser here is likely to face @entity36 in the last 16			0
that might make for a short tournament .			2

world champions play @entity14 in their opening match of this tournament
@entity47 says , ' we want to dominate games by keeping possession '
@entity34 still has spine of team that won in 2010
@entity47 *praises* @entity74 - ' the first coach i ever had '
