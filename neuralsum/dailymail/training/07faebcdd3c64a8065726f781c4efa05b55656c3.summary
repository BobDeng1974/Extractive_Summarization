by @entity0 @entity1 in @entity2 is moving up in the world – big time			1
once voted as one of the world ’s biggest eyesores , it has now catapulted into the top ten public squares across the globe			1
the $ 450 million building opened in 2002 to great controversy over the design and costs with many describing the architecture as simply ugly			1
then to add insult to injury - the 20th century design was voted fifth on a list of the world ’s ugliest buildings in 2009 , alongside a library in @entity23 , a television tower in @entity25 and @entity27 's 1970s - era parliament building			1
but now the buzzy square , which has about 9 million visitors each year , has done a complete turn - around by coming in at sixth place in the top ten public squares around the world			1
‘ it ’s not got much to do with the style of the buildings that surround it but the fact that it has actually provided @entity2 with a great place to bring people together , ’ he said			2
‘ it actually has events non-stop so people enjoy it – it ’s a great place to go in central @entity2			2
’ coming in either side of @entity1 was @entity70 in the @entity71 in fifth spot and the @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity75 ranking number 7			0
@entity41 - e @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity39 2			1
@entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 3			2
@entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 4			0
@entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 8			0
@entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 9			0
@entity90 , @entity91 prof @entity52 said @entity1 was significant in terms of 20th century public spaces as many others selected for the top ten were designed hundreds of years earlier			1
‘ it feels like you ’re in a piece of outback landscape with the tiny cobblestone from @entity101 which is unusual , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s why people do n’t understand it - you would n’t say cliffs and valleys in the @entity108 are ugly and it ’s got that sense to it			0
' other historical squares receiving a ranking are @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 as the runner up and @entity80 in @entity81 rounding off the top three			1
two massive global tourist attractions - @entity84 ’s @entity83 and @entity89 ’s @entity88 - featured at fourth and the ninth place respectively			0
while the @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 got a mention for eighth place , and @entity90 in @entity91 completing the top ten public squares			1
prof @entity52 said the list was an interesting cross section of public spaces throughout the centuries			0
‘ @entity1 is significant in terms of the last century because most others were taken from across hundreds of years , ’ he said			0
‘ so i think they have tried to balanced and generous in their spread of across time			0
’ however , he did admit that there were slim pickings when it came to public squares on offer from the 20th century			1
' they ’ve tried to find a representative new square from the 20th century and it ’s essentially one of the few , ' he said			2
' most large public spaces were created more than 100 years ago so in actual fact that is a mark of how in the 20th century there were probably very few of these major public spaces			2
' prof @entity52 described some of the architecture surrounding the most famous squares as ' second rate '			0
' it 's about the fact that there is a relief from the density of the city and a space to gather , ' he said			0
@entity77 , @entity78 , in @entity79 came in second place with the @entity157 red , shell - shaped medieval piazza that hosts a horse raise - the @entity160 - twice a year @entity80 in @entity81 , which made it into the top three , is considered the city 's central square and surrounded by significant buildings - @entity165 , the @entity166 and @entity168 's mausoleum @entity84 's popular @entity83 got the fourth spot : since its inception by the great @entity173 architect @entity172 , the square has been a source of pride for all @entity176 and is a constant stage for art , culture and other events number 5 : @entity70 is a plaza of huge proportions located directly in front of @entity183 in the @entity71 , the papal enclave surrounded by @entity184 , directly west of the neighbourhood @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity75 came in at number 7 : the space is accessible to pedestrians from 13 different points and is one of the best car - free squares in @entity192 , as it is generally only accessible via foot placing eight in the top ten is @entity85 , @entity196 in @entity87 : as the centre of the ancient @entity200 capital , the plaza is richly layered with history from its foundation to the @entity204 arcades that surround the square and the more modern formal layout with its hard and soft landscape acts as a healthy , beating heart to the city the bright lights of @entity88 comes in at number nine : the world 's most buzzing square in the city that never sleeps has a constant stimuli making it an absolute ' eye - gasm ' and complete sensory overload lucky last but not least goes @entity218 in @entity91 : huge underground viaducts provides pedestrian accesses - it is filled to the brim with people suggesting its power as a site of solidarity and tool for protest			1
