@entity0 are the embarrassment of the @entity2 after a third humiliating defeat in three matches against @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7			1
@entity9 's panel of experts — @entity11 , @entity12 , cricket correspondent @entity13 and cricket writer and @entity16 editor @entity14 — discuss the big questions arising from another @entity2 failure			1
@entity0 captain @entity19 plays a shot during the @entity2 match against @entity7 in @entity22 @entity0 @entity23 ( front ) loses his wicket to @entity7 's @entity26 during the @entity2 match is there any hope left for @entity0 at this @entity2 ? @entity11 : if there is , it 's because of the ridiculous format of this tournament			1
they should beat @entity35 and @entity36 , but the best we can hope for is some one - off brilliance in the quarter - final			2
@entity13 : you would think not and yet the flawed format still gives them every chance of facing @entity44 , a team they have beaten in their past two meetings , in a quarter - final in @entity49			2
that should not be possible after the way @entity0 have stunk the tournament out			1
@entity14 : the bare minimum for them was a quarter - final			2
now , if either @entity35 or @entity36 have a good day , they may not even make that			0
they 've had four years to prepare , yet look further off the pace than ever			0
@entity12 : realistically , no. it 's sad to see so much effort going into plans and strategy that just do not fit in modern international cricket			1
i 've never seen a team leave the ball so much in the one - day game			0
if there 's any width other teams just whack it			2
@entity73 bats for @entity0 during their match against @entity7 at @entity76 @entity0 have slumped to three straight @entity2 defeats against @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 can anything be done in the short - term ? @entity11 : they need variety in their bowling , and a more attacking no 3			1
if they get through to a quarter - final on a drop - in wicket against @entity44 or @entity85 , four 85mph right - arm seamers are n't going to surprise anyone			0
@entity87 offers something different , and @entity89 is @entity0 's best off - spinner			1
and i 'd get @entity92 in for @entity93			0
@entity13 : they must play @entity92			0
why not ? @entity23 should not be learning the ropes in the biggest limited - overs tournament of all			0
@entity0 just do not seem to rate @entity92 and if that is the case what is he doing here ? if he does not play in @entity102 on monday they might as well send him home			1
and get @entity103 in earlier			0
leaving him just 19 balls against @entity7 was criminal			0
@entity14 : they 've got to stop going on about stats , which mean little in the new era of fielding restrictions , and go for broke with players who scare the opposition			0
they should also pick their best spinner , @entity89 , because four right - arm seamers are n't doing the job			0
@entity12 : @entity92 can be brought in but do n't expect him to start blasting it			0
if he was a success from the word go it would be a bonus			0
so many people in the game say he should have been in the 50 - over team for the past 18 months ! @entity0 batsman @entity103 ducks a delivery against @entity7 at the @entity76 @entity7 batsman @entity125 ( left ) dives to make his crease just in time against @entity0 and what about the long - term ? @entity11 : there 's no easy fix			1
but i wish selectors would show faith in their one - day players like in test cricket : look at how they backed @entity73			2
give @entity92 20 one - dayers to see what he 's made of			1
@entity13 : rip it up and start again			0
@entity0 need to work towards as separate a one - day team as possible , leaving @entity139 and @entity140 , to name two , to focus on @entity141			1
bring in the likes of @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 and keep them together , ideally under a different coach working on modern limited - overs skills			0
perhaps @entity149 , who won the @entity150 and @entity151 with @entity7 , could step up while @entity152 concentrates on @entity141			2
i know split coaches did n't work last time but @entity0 prioritised test cricket then			1
they have to give equal billing to 50 and 20 - over cricket from now			1
@entity14 : @entity0 have to accept , finally , that the game has changed , and back more youngsters — the likes of @entity144 and @entity161			1
but the problem runs deeper : @entity0 is inherently a test nation			1
until they take 50 - over cricket seriously , they 'll always flop at @entity167			2
@entity12 : @entity0 need to show imagination in selection			1
think about the words ' dynamic ' and ' power ' and pick the team accordingly			0
i 'll throw in three names : @entity145 , @entity144 and @entity175			0
i 'd implore @entity0 to look at how other teams are doing it — people like @entity179 @entity178 , @entity180 of @entity6 and the dynamic @entity179 duo of @entity182 and @entity183			1
they show absolutely no fear at all			0
@entity143 ( pictured in january 2015 ) has been backed by @entity13 to help reinvent the @entity0 set - up 24 - year - old @entity144 ( pictured playing for @entity187 in june 2014 ) , is another name being mooted for @entity0 what do you think of @entity19 as captain ? @entity11 : i 've been disappointed with the way he 's become infected with management - speak			1
here 's a player whose flair and inventiveness made him what he is			2
instead , he 's talking about statistics			2
but you do need a plan , and a captain 's only as good as his bowling attack			1
@entity13 : disappointing so far			0
still looks out of form with the bat , has n't been the pro-active , imaginative leader we hoped and seems to be in denial			0
he should be criticised for playing in the @entity209 rather than leading @entity0 against @entity210 in may			1
if he does n't want the captaincy , give it to @entity73			2
@entity14 : he has a bit more about him tactically than @entity213			0
@entity19 was given just the tri-series in @entity5 to prepare			1
what did the @entity215 expect ? @entity12 : i like @entity19 immensely but i shudder at the interviews he 's giving			1
he 's just talking statistics all the time ! forget stats — if we 've got the players to make an impact , let them play in a different style , on instinct			2
he must also show more imagination in the field			0
@entity19 's form for @entity0 has come under particular scrutiny during @entity0 's woeful @entity2 campaign does @entity152 still have much to prove as coach ? @entity11 : yes , lots			1
he 's partly a victim of @entity0 's one - day struggles , but it 's a worry to see some players going backwards			1
turning round the test series against @entity44 was to his credit , but he 'll be judged on the rest of this @entity2 and the @entity238 later this year			2
@entity13 : i so want him to succeed , but there are worrying signs he looks out of his depth at international level			0
the players seem to like and respect him but he does not seem to be inspiring them			0
@entity14 : he has everything to prove			0
he was lucky to be re-appointed and results have mainly been poor			0
he inherited a shambles but at some point that stops being relevant			0
@entity12 : @entity152 is ageing by the day			0
i hope he is looking at what other coaches like @entity251 and @entity252 are doing with @entity5 and @entity6			0
do n't have any regard for reputations — swing from the hip			0
@entity0 's disappointing @entity2 has raised questions over the future of coach @entity152 can @entity259 really play for @entity0 again ? @entity11 : i 've always believed in picking the best side , then man - managing it			1
but i feel there 's too much baggage with @entity259 now			1
also , he 's not the player he once was			2
if he was 24 , rather than 34 , you might give him another go			2
but the focus should be on @entity0 's one - day team , not @entity259			1
@entity13 : well , what a can of worms incoming @entity215 chairman @entity269 opened			0
the suggestion is that nothing has changed regarding @entity259 but @entity269 ' clumsy words undermined the management while the @entity215 's attempt to distance themselves from his comments by talking about ' positive influences ' just made it worse			1
@entity14 : would he really have saved @entity0 at the @entity2 ? he played nine odis in 2013 and averaged 28			1
and he 'll be 35 soon			0
i loved watching him , but let 's not pretend he 's a panacea			2
@entity12 : if it is going to happen @entity259 must be playing county cricket — red - ball and white - ball			1
if he commits to the @entity288 game and scores heavily then he should be back in the mix. whether or not @entity259 should return to the @entity0 set - up remains a hotly contested debate sportsmail experts are skeptical that 34 - year - old @entity259 's return would necessarily improve @entity0			1

@entity9 cricket experts give their views on @entity0 's @entity2 woes
@entity0 have lost three games and won one at the @entity2
captain @entity19 has come under particular scrutiny
@entity259 's potential @entity0 return remains a heated debate
