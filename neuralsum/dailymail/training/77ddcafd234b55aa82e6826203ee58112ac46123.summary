by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 11:38 est , 30 may 2013 a new low - cost air carrier has unveiled a ‘ hipster - chic ’ uniform for cabin crew in a bid to ensure that their service appeals to younger travelers			1
@entity8 unveiled the uniform for its new discount international airline @entity11 on monday , which includes fedoras and cardigans			1
since the service is aimed at a younger market than the more traditional service run by @entity8 's main brand , it has decided to take a somewhat unorthodox approach to cabin wear to help foster a ‘ fresh , comfortable , and vacation - like environment			2
’ too cool for the skies ? @entity11 has unveiled its hipster - inspired uniform hat 's the way i like it : despite critics claims that @entity11 are a ' tad late ' in issuing fedoras to cabin crew , the company claims the look is ' fashion - forward ' the airline , which launches on july 1 , claims the look is ‘ fashion forward ’ and plans to keep the uniforms in service for the next five to seven years			1
critics however have been quick to pounce on the airline ’s attempt to give the uniform a ‘ hipster makeover , ’ claiming that the airline is ‘ a tad late on the “ cool hat ” bandwagon ’			2
rather than evoking the trendy @entity47 neighborhood of @entity48 , the uniform makes the cabin crew look more like extras from ‘ @entity51 ’			1
commentators have also questioned how the ' young look ' will work on real hostesses and older workers			1
as well as the offending fedoras , the uniforms also include scarfs , trousers , and gray and red @entity61 brand shoes for female staff as well as the offending fedoras , the uniforms also include cardigans , trousers , and gray and red @entity61 brand shoes			0
the criticism does n't seem to bothering @entity11 in the slightest			2
‘ our personality , which is fresh and youthful , seems to be the impression that ’s coming through , ’ @entity71 , vice president of customer experience , told @entity72			0
‘ the terms being used so far all have a youthful , on - trend context so that ’s a success in our books			0
’ cool uniform : @entity8 claims to have received more than 5,000 résumés for flight attendant positions @entity11 flight attendants have also been receiving customer service training at the @entity84 in @entity85			2
the airline also received flak after it emerged that @entity11 staff have to pay $ 2,000 towards the training			0
the staff will repay @entity8 $ 49 a month for the next three years to cover their training and if they leave the job before then , they ’ll still owe the money			0
that has n’t stopped people flocking to apply to work for the airline			0
since announcing the new carrier last year , @entity8 claims to have received more than 5,000 résumés for flight attendant positions			0
critics claims that cabin crew on @entity11 resemble extras from @entity51 rather than hipsters from the @entity108 neighborhood of @entity48			1

when @entity11 launches next month cabin crew will be wearing a more *relaxed* uniform
the company claims their new look is ' fashion - forward '
but critics have been quick to claim fedoras are ' old hat ' and that crew look more like extras from ' glee ' rather than @entity108 hipsters
commentators have also questioned how the ' young look ' will work on real hostesses and older workers
