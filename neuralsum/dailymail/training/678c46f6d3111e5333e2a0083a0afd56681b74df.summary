@entity1 secretary @entity0 said it would not be ' appropriate ' to publish list of names @entity7 suspects who were sent official letters telling them they were not wanted by the authorities can not be named because of their ‘ human rights ’ , a minister declared last night			1
@entity1 secretary @entity0 said she had seen the list of names but it would not be ‘ appropriate ’ or ‘ helpful ’ to publish it because it could breach their right to life and their right to privacy under the @entity18			1
in a statement to mps , miss @entity0 said anyone who received a letter could still face prosecution and possession of one did not amount to a ‘ get out of jail free card ’			1
the existence of the letters , which were sent to nearly 200 @entity7 suspects after the @entity30 , only emerged last year after a failed prosecution			1
police arrested @entity33 , 62 , from @entity34 as he passed through @entity35 last year over the 1982 @entity37 bombing in which four @entity39 soldiers were murdered			0
but the case was thrown out by a senior judge after mr @entity33 revealed the existence of a ‘ comfort ’ letter sent to him , by mistake , despite an outstanding warrant against him from the @entity32			0
miss @entity0 made her statement in an effort to make clear the letters could not be relied upon			1
she said : ‘ no one should take any comfort from these letters , no one should rely on them			0
’ ‘ to all those who have a letter i say , if the police or prosecuting authorities have evidence which is available today or becomes available in the future to pursue you , they can and will pursue you			0
’ she said decisions by prosecutors and the police would not be influenced by the letters and a suspect could be prosecuted if there was enough evidence against them			0
she also said publishing the list could undermine any future prosecution			2
but her refusal to name those on the list of suspects enraged @entity76 on the @entity77 , who asked what message it would send to victims of unsolved terror attacks			1
but lady @entity82 mp , of the @entity83 , criticised her decision , saying that not revealing the names gave little comfort to the victims of the @entity7			1
@entity89 mp @entity88 demanded to know if there was a specific security threat against anyone on the list and suggested senior @entity95 leaders such as @entity96 could have been sent a letter			2
@entity33 , 62 , was arrested last year over the 1982 @entity37 bombing			0
the case was thrown out after he revealed the existence of a ‘ comfort ’ letter sent to him , by mistake , despite an outstanding warrant against him in july , a judge - led review of the scheme found that it was systematically flawed in operation but not unlawful in principle			2
the ‘ on the runs ’ scheme saw names of individuals passed to the government , mostly through @entity95			0
anyone found to not be wanted was given a letter of assurance .			0
