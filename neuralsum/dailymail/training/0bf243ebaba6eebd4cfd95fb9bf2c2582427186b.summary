by @entity0 for @entity1 police forces across the country have signed up to a new voluntary code of conduct that will place limits on the stop and search powers used by officers			1

police forces across the country have signed up to a new voluntary code of conduct that will place limits on the stop and search powers used by officers ( file picture ) the changes have been brought in after @entity33 ( @entity33 ) found that 27 per cent of stop and searches did not contain reasonable grounds for suspicion , meaning more than 250,000 of the one million searches conducted last year could have been illegal			1
in addition , black and minority ethnic ( @entity40 ) members of the public were up to six times more likely to be searched than white people			0
forces signed up to the scheme will agree to more limits on blanket section 60 stops , which allow officers to stop people on the anticipation of serious violence without suspicion a person is carrying weapons , while better records will be kept of each instance and published online			1
the @entity57 , the @entity59 's biggest police force , which employs more than 31,000 officers , has signed up to the scheme and said it was introducing those two elements of the new plan from today			2
it comes after @entity23 searches were used as a tactic in combating violent crime at this year 's @entity67			1
last year 47,141 arrests were made as a result of stop and search , representing 20 per cent of total arrests by the @entity57 , and of the 251,161 people who were stopped and searched from august 2013 to july 2014 , 115,270 ( 46 per cent ) were white , 72,016 ( 29 per cent ) were black and 34,267 ( 14 per cent ) were @entity74			2
men accounted for 94 % of all searches			0
home secretary @entity10 has said the powers were being misused , which she warned could be ' hugely damaging to the relationship between the police and the public ' speaking in the @entity83 when announcing the shake - up in april , mrs may said misuse of the power damaged public trust in the police			1
she said : ' while it is undoubtedly an important police power , when it is misused stop and search can be counter-productive			1
' first , it can be an enormous waste of police time			0
second , when innocent people are stopped and searched for no good reason , it is hugely damaging to the relationship between the police and the public			0
in those circumstances it is an unacceptable affront to justice			0
' commander @entity101 , the @entity57 's lead for stop and search , said : ' @entity105 and @entity106 scheme supports the @entity57 's ongoing drive to make stop and search more intelligence - led and effective			0
' the @entity57 has made significant improvements to stop and search over the last two years to not only reduce the total number of people we search , but also to ensure that our officers focus on those areas and types of crime that the public are most concerned about			0
' as a result , we are arresting more people than ever before following the more targeted use of stop and search and routinely find people in possession of weapons and stolen items			0
' in line with the @entity130 scheme and our commitment to increase transparency and accountability , the @entity57 has today introduced a new approach to @entity23 authorisation and has introduced revised recording of stop and search outcomes			2
' we recognise the impact stop and search can have on individuals and communities			0
our work with communities and monitoring groups is helping to ensure we are more transparent than ever in how stop and search helps to reduce crime and keep people safe , but we of course recognise there is much more to do to improve confidence across all communities in the use of the powers			2
