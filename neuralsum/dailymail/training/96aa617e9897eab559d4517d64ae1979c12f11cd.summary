by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:21 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 08:39 est , 11 september 2013 veteran endurance swimmer @entity2 has defended her 110 - mile record feat from @entity4 to @entity5 after sceptics questioned whether she got into or held on to a boat during part of the journey			1
ms @entity2 , 64 , said she swam without holding on to any of the boats or people accompanying her			2
we made it , our team , in squeaky - clean , ethical fashion , ' she said			2
her critics are suspicious about long stretches of the 53 - hour swim where ms @entity2 appeared to have either picked up incredible speed or to have gone without food or drink			1
her speed , at some points more than doubling , has drawn particular scrutiny			0
her team has attributed her speed to the fast - moving @entity47 flowing in her favour			2
the athlete and her team held a conference call with some of the sceptics who questioned her navigator 's credentials and observations of the currents			1
' many of us are pursuing this as a technical matter , ' said kayaker and lawyer @entity60			0
' having the information out there helps us analyse it , measure it , test it , smell it , you know , decide if it looks right and is right , and you guys keep saying it is			0
so , let us look at it			0
' @entity74 : @entity2 's navigator said the above ' spot trackers ' used by her critics to claim she cheated are not accurate a helping push : @entity2 's claim that she was helped by a particularly swift current towards @entity35 has been backed up by independent ocean expert dr @entity81 ms @entity2 's navigator , @entity82 , said her fastest speed averaged about 3.97mph over a 5.5 - hour period over about 19 miles , crossing the strongest parts of the @entity47 , which was flowing at a favourable angle			1
' what you 're seeing is the combination of the speed of @entity2 propelling herself in the water and the speed of the current carrying us across the bottom , ' he said			2
@entity82 said @entity2 ’s speed and location ca n’t be measured by ‘ spot trackers ’ - that were quoted by the doubters - were simply estimating @entity100 ’s location for public viewing and nothing more			1
he told @entity103 : ‘ those spot trackers are for the public to watch @entity2 swim along			1
the positions that i have on my gps are the real positions , ' @entity106 , co-founder of the online @entity107 , says it will be interesting to compare observations made by ms @entity2 's navigator with publically available data about the currents she swam			1
ms @entity2 attempted the swim from @entity4 to @entity5 four times before finally completing the journey on her fifth attempt , making her the first to make it without the aid of a shark cage			1
secret weapon : this is @entity2 's first attempt using the prosthetic face mask custom - made to shield her from the paralyzing stings of the box jellyfish , which some fellow swimmers consider to be cheating she did follow a streamer dangled in the water by her team and used a specialised mask and bodysuit to protect herself from venomous jellyfish , which are considered a more serious threat than sharks in those waters			1
some members of the marathon swimming communities say these methods were against the traditions of her sport			0
@entity2 wore a full non-neoprene bodysuit , gloves , booties and a silicone mask at night , when jellyfish are a particular problem , and removed the suit once she got over the reef on her approach to @entity35			2
close to shore : @entity2 pictured about two miles out from shore in the @entity150			0
her critics feel that there is a chance she got out of the water and went on board the accompanying boat more than just encouraging words ? some other swimmers say that an uptick in her speed mid race implies that she may have gotten a boost of oxygen from her team an oceanographer not affiliated with @entity2 's team said the swimmer could n't have picked a more perfect current to get from @entity169 to @entity35			1
dr. @entity170 of @entity81 's @entity171 based in @entity172 , @entity5			0
said he got an email questioning whether @entity2 's swim was a hoax , so he decided to look at the charts for himself			2
what he saw convinced him that she could do it			0
‘ it was like a walking sidewalk heading to @entity35 and then got off it , ’ @entity81 told @entity103			1
‘ i looked at the gps locations and they all seem to be correct			0
she got great benefit from the current			0
’ @entity188 , a @entity35 boat captain and acquaintance of @entity2 's , was called to be an observer for the swim when @entity192 , a former @entity24 national open - water coach , was unable to make it			1
' i can say unequivocally she swam every stroke without question , ' @entity188 said			0
exhausted : the grandmother appeared to he covered in salt after the length of time she spent in the water critics have said @entity188 was too close to @entity2 to be an independent observer of her swim			1
@entity188 has in the past helped @entity2 by providing housing for her when the swimmer stayed in the @entity150 , but she said she remained on the periphery of @entity2 's team			2
' i think anyone who knows me knows me as a person of high integrity			0
i believe that 's why @entity2 asked me , and i took my job very seriously , ' @entity188 said			0
' she was giving her all and i would give her my best			0
' since none of the various open - water swimming associations dictate how someone should swim from @entity4 to @entity5 - officially accomplished only by @entity2 and @entity220 , who used a shark cage - @entity2 just had to follow generally accepted rules about not getting out of the water or using equipment such as fins .			1

@entity2 denies that she ever held onto the support boat during the feat
she completed the swim in *52* hours , *54* minutes and 18 seconds
critics think she may have gotten a boost of oxygen from her team or even gone on the boat during the 110 - mile course
her navigator had told @entity103 he will prove all the doubters *wrong*
