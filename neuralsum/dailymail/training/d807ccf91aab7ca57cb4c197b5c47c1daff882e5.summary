@entity0 and her husband @entity1			1
she yesterday launched an attack on society ’s ‘ obsession with women ’s role as mothers ’ @entity0 yesterday launched a scathing attack on society ’s ‘ obsession with women ’s role as mothers ’ - which she branded a ‘ @entity15 ’ view of parenting			1
the junior equalities minister was speaking at an event on ‘ what women voters want ’ , where she came under pressure to provide financial support for stay - at - home mothers			1
miss @entity0 , who is married to a fellow mp @entity23 and gave birth to their first child last year , said the @entity27 had driven a ‘ revolution ’ by pushing for flexible hours and shared parental leave of up to a year			1
she said the government had also taken steps to increase tax - free childcare for working parents			0
but she added : ‘ the very idea of men caring for small children or mothers forging successful careers is anathema to many @entity39 , who ’d apparently rather have a @entity42 version of parenting			1
at least we recognise that women might want both a fulfilling job and family life			0
‘ with a paltry two weeks of paternity leave and popular culture that brands dads as hapless and bumbling , men are written out of the family script with worrying regularity			1
’ however after her speech , several audience members raised concerns about full - time mothers being ignored by politicians			2
@entity61 , a party member who has been a stay - at - home mother for ten years , said the @entity27 should consider ways to ‘ level the playing field ’ for full - time parents who ‘ pay a high price ’ in lost income			1
she went on to say : ‘ not only do stay - at - home parents care for their children but they often provide the glue that makes a neighbourhood a community and undertake much voluntary work supporting working parents and older people			1
‘ for this they pay a very heavy price in lost income , lower self - esteem and significantly reduced opportunities for future employment and pensions			0
so can we please consider policies to level the playing field , not just insist on pushing people back into work			2
she revealed that she had suggested the policy to treasury secretary @entity100 earlier this year , but said he was ‘ only interested in helping working parents ’			2
speaking about her proposal , she said : ‘ this would give mothers and fathers at home a value , and not just people with children but others with caring responsibilities			1
many people only do this for a couple of years and then go back to work , but it ’s a really important thing to do			0
’ miss @entity0 said she would be interested in seeing details of the plan to help stay - at - home mothers , but added : ‘ it ’s pretty expensive to do so and that ’s the big challenge			1
’ @entity122 last night declared : ‘ i want to have what men have ’ – as she set out the case for women to combine family life with a career			0
the high - flying mother - of - three said women feel pressured to choose between having a job and having children			0
mrs @entity122 , who prefers to be known by her maiden name @entity122 , told the @entity133 : ‘ i am asked all the time do you want to have it all , and i do n’t want to have it all – i want to have what men have			0
@entity140 is the new black : @entity122 's colourful shoes yesterday and right , her red printed top ‘ so if many men have children and a job , and that ’s what they choose , i do not know why i can not have that , if that ’s what i choose			2
’ mrs @entity122 , who earns a reported £ 500,000 a year as a partner at international law firm @entity152 , has spoken out in the past about the need for men to take more responsibility for childcare			2
earlier this year she suggested that fathers who look after their children have ‘ more cojones ’ and has hit out at ‘ dinosaurs ’ who believe the issue should be left to women , saying that caring for children ‘ does not affect your level of testosterone ’			1
speaking yesterday , mrs @entity122 also said it was ‘ crucial ’ for women who want to work and have a family to choose their husbands carefully			0
but in an interview with @entity173 , she admitted that not all women wanted to work while their children were growing up , saying : ‘ there will be other women who do n’t want that			0
’ unlike her husband , she was seen wearing only two different outfits yesterday			0
mrs @entity122 chose jeans , shoes from @entity181 and a red printed top from @entity184 brand @entity183 for a visit to a school			0
she later changed into a beige dress and bright orange shoes for her husband ’s question - and - answer session .			0
