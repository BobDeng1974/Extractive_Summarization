with her dark sunglasses and stony expression , the image of @entity4 staring at her smartphone made her look such a boss that it launched its own @entity9 parody account			2
the photograph , which dates from a trip to @entity12 , @entity13 in september 2011 , was even adopted by the former secretary of state herself for her @entity16 profile picture			1
but it seems the picture , which inspired hundreds of comedy memes , could be no laughing matter for @entity4 as it emerges the photograph could be a figurative smoking gun			1
indeed , @entity4 herself has removed the image removed from her @entity16 account because it could show her using her controversial personal email account to conduct diplomacy in @entity13			1
for more than a year , the former secretary of state had used the monochrome image of her using a @entity33 on board a c - military plane around a month after @entity37 's regime fell			0
switcheroo : @entity4 swapped out a picture of her using a @entity33 on her way to @entity13 for a silhouette promoting a gender equality initiative the picture , regularly seen by her 2.9 million followers , was removed sunday - to promote a political campaign for gender equality , timed to coincide with @entity47			1
the image was once a symbol of @entity4 's funny side as the face of the texts from @entity4 meme , which she said had given her ' many @entity55 '			1
but the change also comes at a time when senior figures in @entity59 are intensifying scrutiny of @entity4 's communications from 2009 - 13 , which it was recently revealed were not conducted via official @entity65 accounts			1
proof ? the chairman of the @entity68 on @entity69 mentioned that he has seen no emails from @entity4 's time in @entity13 , despite pictures such as this one from 2011 , showing her using a @entity33 the picture inspired hundreds of comedy memes posted on a parody @entity9 account last year			1
this one refers to @entity79 's pop song @entity78 a lot of the memes make a joke about how serious @entity4 looks and speculate about what she 's doing on her phone the image of @entity4 staring at her smartphone with her dark sunglasses and stony expression make her look like she does n't have time for anyone @entity4 has handed over swathes of communications from the time , but it has been claimed that the documents have ' huge gaps '			2
the image was mentioned by the chairman of a @entity68 into the 2012 attack on @entity104 diplomats in @entity69 to suggest that vital communications from @entity4 's involvement in @entity13 were being kept from public view			2
rep. @entity108 ( r - @entity109 ) , today told @entity111 's @entity110 that he has been provided with no emails from the september 2011 trip - despite @entity4 being clearly pictured communicating while aboard the plane			1
he said : ' there are gaps of months and months and months			0
and if you think to that iconic picture of her on a @entity122 flying to @entity13 , she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand , we have no e-mails from that day			0
in fact , we have no e-mails from that trip			0
users could n't resist creating memes that make @entity4 look like she receives lots of invitations to parties some make a joke out of those intending to run against @entity4 , like @entity139 senator @entity138 others imagine @entity4 talks to other famous internet faces over youth behaviour including grumpy cat @entity4 made this entry into the texts from @entity4 account herself - the entry does not insult any political rivals , but just ribs the site 's creators			0
' so , it 's strange credibility to believe that if you 're on your way to @entity13 to discuss @entity13 policy that there 's not a single document that has been turned over to @entity59			1
' so , there are huge gaps			0
and with respect to the president , it 's not up to @entity4 to decide what is a public record and what 's not			0
' @entity108 also said the records do n't include anything from around the dates of the @entity69 attack itself , in which the @entity104 ambassador to @entity13 was killed			2
suspicions : rep. @entity108 ( r - @entity109 ) mentioned the pictured of @entity4 while contending that emails from her time in @entity13 had not been handed over as of sunday evening , @entity4 's profile still featured the @entity33 image , but as the ' header photo ' displayed at the top of the @entity16 page			1
in order to see it , users have to access her profile directly			0
the image will not appear in the timelines of her followers , nor when she is retweeted or appears in search results			0
@entity4 herself tweeted to explain the change of profile picture			0
she wrote : ' see my new profile pic to raise awareness on how far we 've come in reaching equal rights for women & girls worldwide			2
' she also included a link to @entity200 , which is sponsored by the @entity4 foundation she runs with her husband , former president @entity202 .			0

former secretary of state swapped out phone picture for blank silhouette
said the switch was to raise awareness of gender equality initiative
came amid huge scrutiny over use of private emails to enact foreign policy
photograph was used to complain about emails *withheld* from @entity59
@entity108 said it ' strains credibility ' to think picture from 2011 does not show @entity4 dealing with @entity13 situation using private accounts
picture also inspired ' texts from @entity4 ' meme , which took off in 2012
