the @entity0 is rationing operations and treatment for patients deemed too fat			1
an investigation has found that four in five health trusts refuse to fund some procedures for patients classified obese			1
these include hip and knee surgery , @entity11 , joint replacements and in the case of one organisation , all routine operations			1
details obtained from @entity18 requests also show that two thirds of trusts deny some procedures for smokers			1
senior doctors have described the policies as ‘ blatant rationing ’ and say they are ‘ immoral ’ and ‘ unfair ’			1
an investigation has found that four in five health trusts refuse to fund some procedures for patients classified obese			1
meanwhile two thirds of trusts deny some procedures for smokers but managers said that given their increasingly limited budgets , it was inappropriate to offer certain non-urgent treatments to patients for which they might not be effective			1
the @entity0 as a whole is under severe financial strain and is struggling to meet the demands of the rising and increasingly ageing population			0
last year its chief executive @entity41 predicted that an extra £ 30 billion would need to go into its budget by 2020 just to ensure the standards of care did not slip			0
in the face of such financial pressure , many trusts have begun rationing procedures which are n’t deemed urgent to save money			1
but this investigation by @entity52 reveals the extent to which managers are refusing patients treatment due to their lifestyles			2
@entity18 responses from 145 of the @entity58 , ( @entity59 ) , – local @entity0 bodies – showed that 38 per cent restricted some procedures for obese patients			1
a further 63 per cent refused to allow patients to have certain treatment if they smoked			2
dr @entity65 , deputy chair of the @entity67 ’s gp committee , who is based in @entity69 , said managers were using ‘ spurious clinical reasons ’ to discriminate some patients			2
he added : ‘ it ’s blatant rationing			1
@entity75 should be open and honest			0
‘ if we ’re going to ration a service we should ration it for all people , not just those in particular groups and pretend it ’s for clinical reasons			0
these include hip and knee surgery , @entity11 , joint replacements and in the case of one organisation , all routine operations			1
senior doctors have described the policies as ‘ blatant rationing ’ and say they are ‘ immoral ’ ‘ if it ’s purely down to cost saving , it ’s not ethical			1
‘ there are clearly cases where certain people ’s body size may make it difficult to safely do a certain procedure , but they ’re exceptional			0
‘ i think what ’s happening here is overt rationing to save money			2
’ @entity105 , chief executive of the @entity106 , said : ‘ we are aware that hospital trusts are under considerable financial pressures , but we hope that the need to save money wo n’t affect patient safety			2
‘ each case must be individually assessed and each decision must be ethical and in the best interests of the patient			0
‘ we recognise that patients do have a responsibility to look after their own health and to be aware of the outcomes of unhealthy lifestyles			0
‘ however , patients should not take the brunt for years of wasteful spending in the @entity0			0
‘ it is easy to target vulnerable patients , and we must be very careful not to unfairly discriminate against people who are n’t always able to speak out			0
’ @entity128 in @entity129 refuses to offer any routine surgery to patients whose @entity132 ( @entity132 ) is above 35			1
this is a measurement of obesity and above 25 is classified as overweight , over 30 obese and more than 35 , morbidly obese			0
and a total of 30 @entity75 refused to pay for @entity11 for women with a @entity132 of over 30			2
the figures reveal that @entity128 in @entity129 refuses to offer any routine surgery to patients whose @entity132 ( @entity132 ) is above 35 this is equivalent to a 5ft 6 woman ( 170 m ) weighing just under 13 and a half stone ( 84 kg )			2
dr @entity143 , gp in @entity144 , @entity129 , who is also chair of the @entity146 said : ‘ what we hate as @entity148 is blanket bans and you ca n’t just take @entity132 ( a measure of obesity ) as a reason to operate or not operate			0
‘ some restrictions could have a sound clinical basis , he said , but it is wrong to turn away patients based on weight and do nothing to help change their circumstances			0
‘ weight loss interventions must be offered , otherwise it ’s immoral and unethical , ’ he said			0
several of the @entity75 said that @entity11 and joint replacements , for example , were n’t always successful for the obese patients and therefore not ‘ cost effective			1
’ last year managers at @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 threatened to ban all treatments for anyone with a @entity132 above 35 to help cut a £ 14.5 million shortfall in its budget			0
they subsequently dropped the proposals following an outcry from patient groups and health professionals , including the @entity178 .			0

ops rationed include hip and knee surgery , @entity11 , and joint replacements
one hospital has restricted all routine operations for obese patients
two thirds of trusts also deny some procedures for those who smoke
senior doctors have *blasted* the ' immoral ' policies as ' blatant rationing '
but managers said limited budgets mean they *'ve* had to refuse some ops
