more than 100,000 people have bought ceramic poppies from the @entity3 's art installation that pays tribute to @entity6 and @entity7 soldiers killed in the @entity8			1
sales of the poppies , from ceramic artist @entity14 ' installation @entity15 , have raised more than £ 2.5million in just two days , the profits of which will go directly to six charities for servicemen and women			1
today mr @entity14 , who works from his studio in @entity20 , described the public reaction to his art , in which one poppy for each dead soldier is being placed in the dry moat at the @entity3 , as ' overwhelming '			1
' when i had the idea , i never imagined the reaction would be so overwhelming			0
' i think that it is something everybody can relate to and they feel very personally about			0
' the artist had the idea for a ' sea of red ' after reading the will of a @entity20 man who joined up and died in @entity51			2
' i do n't know his name or where he was buried or anything about him , ' said @entity14 , who found the will among other old records in @entity56			0
' but this line he wrote , when everyone he knew was dead and everywhere around him was covered in blood , jumped out at me : ' the blood - swept lands and seas of red , where angels fear to tread			0
' ' i believe he meant the angels to refer to his children			0
' ceramic artists @entity14 , left , says he is ' staggered ' by the public 's reaction to his installation , which was visited byt the @entity72 and @entity73 on tuesday , right , the day it opened in @entity74 the poppies , which are hand - sculpted and fixed to two - foot metal stalks , are currently being planted in the ground			1
by @entity79 on november 11 , there will be 888 , 246 , each one representing a @entity6 or colonial soldier , sailor or airmen who died in the @entity8			1
the poppies are for sale for £ 25 , and after @entity79 they will be removed from the ground and sent to their buyers with a certificate			2
online sales only opened on tuesday , but staff at the @entity3 say more than 100,000 poppies have sold already , and demand is growing			2
stunning : @entity92 kneels by a mass of ceramic poppies - each is being sold for £ 25 @entity96 , @entity97 : ' we 're absolutely delighted with the response from the public			0
' ten per cent of the sale price , plus all profits , will go to six service charities : @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity108 , the @entity104 , @entity105 and the @entity106 ( @entity107 )			1
a @entity3 spokesman said : ' the charities will receive ten per cent of every poppy sold			1
' however , they will also receive an equal share of the net proceeds once all costs have been recovered			0
' these are costs incurred by @entity119 and @entity120 in manufacturing , transporting , installing and selling the poppies as well as vat			0
' the ten per cent donation from each poppy , combined with the net proceeds , will raise millions of pounds for the six charities if all poppies are sold , and @entity119 and @entity120 will not profit from the sale of the poppies			1
' volunteers began installing the poppies on tuesday and will continue until @entity79			2
during this time , every night at twilight the names of 180 serving military are being read out in a roll of honour , followed by the @entity138 bugle call played by a single bugler at @entity141 terrace .			0

each of the poppies represents @entity7 soldier killed in @entity8
