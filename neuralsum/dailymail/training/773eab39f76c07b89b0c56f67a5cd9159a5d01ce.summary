@entity0 looks forward to being able to field two different but equally capable @entity2 teams			1
the @entity4 boss has found to his cost that his squad is not as strong as he wants it to be , never more so than when he played saturday 's opponents @entity8 earlier in the season			1
ahead of the second leg of the @entity20 qualifying play - off against @entity13 at @entity14 in august - which they lost 1 - 0 following a 1 - 1 draw in @entity18 the previous week - the @entity19 made 10 changes for the trip to the @entity23 in the @entity24 and lost 1 - 0			1
@entity0 is looking forward to being able to field two different but equally capable @entity2 teams and following the 2 - 2 @entity25 draw away to @entity26 the following month , @entity0 made six changes for the visit of @entity29 and dropped another two points in the 1 - 1 draw , bringing more criticism his way			1
it appeared that lessons have been learned following the home 2 - 1 @entity25 win over @entity38 outfit @entity37 just over a week ago , with @entity0 making only three changes for the league encounter against @entity41 at @entity14 which they won 2 - 0			1
recalling the first game against @entity46 , the former @entity44 boss said : ' there are two things there			2
hopefully within one year or two years , we can play those kind of teams and win			2
' two , there were too many changes			2
we had 10 changes in that game			2
it was a very important game we had in the @entity20 afterwards so that was something we had to do			2
' against @entity29 we had five or six changes and the last time we had only three and we played better and won			0
' we have to learn from this and try to develop everyone so we can play two different teams sometimes if we need to			0
' goalkeeper @entity64 was on the bench for the defeat against @entity68 ' side and is looking to make amends at @entity14			1
the @entity71 ' goalkeeper @entity64 is looking to make amends after the defeat against @entity8 the @entity75 international said : ' they have already beaten us this season			1
up there we made a few changes after a @entity81 game , this time at home we will be looking to win the game and get our own back for that one			0
' i think they 've done very well			0
@entity88 ( @entity68 ) has changed the way they 've been playing in the last few years			0
' they 've been passing the ball a lot more and they are quite an attractive team to watch			0
' if they come here and look to do that again then there is a possibility they could cause us problems			0
' much of the talk in the past week has been about the possibility of @entity2 winning the domestic treble as well as the @entity25			1
however , @entity64 is simply enjoying the prospect of success after his stint at @entity107 when avoiding relegation was treated as a positive achievement			1
he said : ' it makes a difference from the last four or five years when i was at @entity107 when any finish above the bottom three was considered a good season			1
' i think being able to win trophies is something every player would rather do than be involved in a relegation scrap			0
' you 've got to go out and try to win every game			0
it 's a different mentality than trying to win 10 games and a few draws to get enough points to see in you the league for another year			0

@entity2 are currently fourth in the @entity24
@entity0 has *struggled* since taking over in the *summer*
@entity64 is hoping to make amends after defeat against @entity8 earlier in the season
