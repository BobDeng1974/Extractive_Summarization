mrs @entity0 , 27 , had arranged to visit the coffee shop with a friend who also had a baby			1
yesterday she said : ‘ @entity6 was asleep so i went in and ordered us some drinks and cake			1
while we sat there he woke up and was quite upset so i started to breastfeed			0
‘ a couple were on a table facing in such a way that they did not have to look at me			2
i heard one of them say “ it is disgusting ” and i was a “ slut ”			2
’ writing on her blog , she added that her friend had confronted the couple , who were in their late 60s			1
they told her it was ‘ offensive ’ and she should breastfeed in the cafe ’s toilet			0

@entity95 , of the @entity96 , said the @entity86 left a loophole open because it only applied to staff and business owners , not other customers			2
a spokesman for the charity @entity102 agreed , adding : ‘ we regularly hear from women who experience harassment because they have breastfed in public			0
‘ it ’s time the government started educating businesses and the wider community to support breastfeeding women , rather than shaming them			0
‘ service providers have to intervene and support women if they are experiencing difficulties with other customers , but legislation does not specifically outlaw customers from making comments such as those directed at @entity119			0
