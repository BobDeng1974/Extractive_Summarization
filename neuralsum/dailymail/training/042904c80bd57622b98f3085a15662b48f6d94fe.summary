@entity10 heard how smog built up during and after a fireworks display at @entity13 which then drifted across the road			1
collisions began just six minutes after the £ 3,000 display which had been organised by 51 - year - old @entity17 , and involved 1,500 shots in 15 minutes			1
drivers on the motorway before the pile - up told a jury how conditions on the road were good until they suddenly hit a ' black wall of smoke ' which ' enveloped ' their cars @entity17 , of @entity28 in @entity9 , is charged with breaching health and safety regulations by failing to ensure the safety of others , which he denies			1
drivers on the motorway before the pile - up told a jury at the court how conditions on the road were good until they suddenly hit a ' black wall of smoke ' which ' enveloped ' their cars on november 4 , 2011			1
one motorist , @entity43 , said : ' it was hard to be sure as i could not see the lane markings			1
i found it difficult to know if i was even travelling in a straight line in my lane			1
' i felt like i was in free fall , but the only thing i could do was to continue to drive straight			1
' i 'm not sure if i hit another vehicle or another vehicle hit me			1
' view of the wreckage on the @entity8 in @entity9 for which @entity17 is facing a @entity57 prosecution at @entity10 @entity58 , a trainee accountant from @entity59 , @entity60 , said : ' i suddenly lost all visibility - it was so sudden it was although someone had just thrown a blanket on my windscreen			1
' i could n't even see the bonnet of my car			1
' while @entity70 lorry driver @entity69 said he could hear sounds from the firework display by the side of the motorway as he entered the smoke			1
he said : ' i could hear sounds of cheering and music like a fairground off to the left			1
' there was no visibility at all so i began to break heavily just waiting for when i would hit something			1
' i felt that at any point something would appear in front of me			1
' i could n't hear the sounds of any vehicle skidding , it seemed as if the vehicles were crashing without braking			1
' @entity91 was driving from @entity92 in @entity60 to @entity93 with his wife @entity94 on the evening of the tragedy			1
the couple stopped at @entity98 services just after 8pm and rejoined the motorway at around 8.20pm , mr @entity91 told the jury			1
' we suddenly hit what i consider almost like a black wall , ' mr @entity91 said			1
' visibility dropped dramatically , certainly from almost 200 feet , 200 metres or so , to virtually nothing			1
' thankfully there was very little traffic around			1
@entity108 , when you are hit with no visibility you brake			1
it was very dark , it was black			1
after six or seven seconds the road just cleared and that was it really			1
' mrs @entity118 , a front - seat passenger in the @entity120 , added : ' as we passed the junction we suddenly , it was very , very suddenly , came into a wall of blackness			1
' it was very dense , we could n’t see anything			1
it was obviously very frightening			1
' the patch lasted several seconds and then suddenly cleared , said mrs @entity118 who told the jury she had been using that stretch of the @entity8 since 1975			1
' as we carried on out of the blackness , i put my window down			2
' it was like the after - smell of fireworks and smoke , ' she said			1
' my reaction was we were lucky we did n’t hit anything but there was n’t anything close to us			2
' @entity143 was driving his @entity144 from @entity92 to @entity145 with his son - in - law , wife , daughter and granddaughter			2
' the weather was clear			2
suddenly i drove into what i would describe as a mix of smoke and fog that was black in colour			2
it came out of nowhere , ' he told the jury			2
aftermath : view of the wreckage which shows burnt out cars along the @entity8 where seven people died @entity10 heard that the smog built up during and after a fireworks display at @entity13 and drifted across the road pile - up : one driver said her car hit a patch of white mist as it entered the @entity8 at junction 25 ' it was so thick			1
it was like something out of a movie			2
it was like you were in a bright room and someone turned the lights off			2
' i have never experienced anything like it			2
it happened so quickly it caused me to brake quite hard			2
' visibility was at zero			2
i could n’t see the bonnet of my car			2
' it was quite scary			2
it was the worst thing i have driven through			2
' @entity17 , 51 , was in charge of the fireworks display in @entity195 , smog from which caused a fatal crash on the @entity8 , @entity10 heard a statement read from one driver , named only as mr @entity201 to the jury , said he was travelling along the motorway in his silver @entity205 car			1
' within a fraction of a second , it seemed my windscreen went completely white , as if a blanket had been thrown over it , ” mr @entity201 said			2
' i was completely taken by surprise			2
the first thing i noticed was three brake lights illuminated in front of me			2
' i immediately thought i was going to hit the vehicle in front so braked as hard as i could , it was a full emergency brake situation			0
' i ca n’t remember what happened next apart from to say i was hit at least four to five times from the side to the rear			0
' at this point i thought the next was going to kill me and felt very vulnerable			0
' i would liken it to being in a pinball machine			0
' in another statement , @entity228 , said conditions were fine on the motorway until his @entity232 suddenly hit ' black smoke '			0
' my vehicle seemed to be completely enveloped , ' mr @entity228 said			0
' i had no view out of the front , sides or rear out the windows			0
' i then saw the large tail lights of a lorry only a few metres in front of me			0
i then braked very hard and managed to bring the car to a halt , about ten feet behind the trailer			0
' i remember thinking " @entity246 , i am stopped on the motorway in thick fog , i need to move "			0
i then felt an impact to the rear offside of my vehicle			0
' @entity251 , an articulated lorry driver for @entity252 with 20 years of experience , had been lying down in the bunk of the lorry while colleague @entity69 drove			0
he told the jury he first felt the brakes being applied ' really , really hard ' - leaving him clinging on to the seat in front of the bunk			0
' i could only see how thick the windscreen glass was , ' mr @entity251 said			0
' i could n’t see anything on the other side of the glass			0
@entity265 ( left ) and @entity267 lorry driver @entity266 ( right ) who were killed in the crash on the @entity8 ' it was just brown , swirling with bits of black stuff in it			0
i could n’t see the windscreen wipers			0
' i was just holding on because if i had let go i would have just been flung forward onto the windscreen			0
' mr @entity251 said he jumped into the front seat as soon as the lorry came to a halt			0
@entity278 , former soldier and lorry driver who was killed in the crash on the @entity8 near @entity195 ' as soon as i sat down , we got hit really hard by another truck , ' he said			0
@entity283 was driving her white @entity285 van from @entity60 to @entity93 to visit her parents for an anniversary celebration			0
mrs @entity283 told the jury : ' i remember thinking " it is a lovely evening " , it was quiet , it was the perfect time to travel			0
' mrs @entity283 , who was driving with her young son and husband , said the vehicle hit a patch of white mist as it entered the @entity8 at junction 25			0
she said the fog was not severe enough to warrant braking and she simply took her foot off the accelerator to pass through it			0
' the fog got slowly thicker but it was still white , ' mrs @entity283 said			0
' then the car went into dark fog or dark smoke but i could still see red lights ( of the car in front )			0
i could just see the lights			0
then they did n’t go anywhere , they just went out			0
' we did n’t see anyone , we just hit whatever was in front of us			0
' we got hit almost immediately , two seconds later , by something behind us after the airbags had gone off			0
her husband , @entity320 , added : ' it was literally like someone had thrown a bag over my head			0
' it was clear , then it was definite fog , then it was a total blackout within a period of less than 30 seconds			0
' the motorists said the smoke cleared relatively quickly after the collisions			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
