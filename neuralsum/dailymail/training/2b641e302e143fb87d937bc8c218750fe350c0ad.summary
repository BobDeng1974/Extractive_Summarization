a mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast which is used to check for cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease			1
it allows the doctor to have a closer look for changes in breast tissue that can not be felt during a breast exam			1
it can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer in women aged 40 to 70			1
mammograms have been controversial and some women have been reluctant to go through with the screening			1
potential harm includes false - negative results , false - positive results , over-diagnosis , over-treatment , and radiation exposure			1
during a mammogram , your breasts are placed between an x-ray plate and a plastic plate which are then attached to the x-ray machine before the breasts are flattened			1
this spreads the breast tissue out to obtain a clearer picture			1
pressure will be felt on the breast for a few seconds and there might be some discomfort but this will only last a few seconds			2
the whole procedure from start to finish lasts for 20 minutes			0
a few weeks later , she was asked to come back to the doctors and was so unconcerned , she did n't even bring anyone with her			1
' i thought i was going back in for a few follow - up images , only to find out in a matter of hours that i had breast cancer , ' @entity0 wrote on her @entity1 blog			1
' i was alone that afternoon , never thinking to bring anyone with me , never thinking that day would be life - altering			2
' my husband was on a business trip and my parents live across the country , but that night everyone flew into @entity162 and we started gearing up for a fight			2
' she spoke on @entity3 this morning about the experience and how it has affected her and her family			0
' @entity93 and @entity1 saved my life by telling me to go into that van for a mammogram			1
' when i was asked , i want to say i was happy to do my part but honestly i was a little reluctant at first			2
i 'd been asked to do it on air to demystify it for women who might be nervous			1
' i 'm 40 and i had been putting it off for a number of years - between flying all over the world for work and running around with my kids to school , ballet and gymnastics			1
like so many women i just kept pushing it off			2
' telling my children was the toughest part and yesterday i had to tell my grandmother - who is not in the best of health			2
' i have to be strong now for other people because i am about to break their hearts			0
' by her side : @entity0 's husband @entity29 was there at the @entity1 studios to support his wife as she made the heartbreaking announcement alone : @entity0 said she did not even bring her husband @entity200 to the second appointment with the doctor because she thought it was nothing family : @entity0 said she is being strong for her children because she realizes telling them she has cancer will break their hearts driving force : @entity0 , 40 , chose the most aggressive form of treatment - a double mastectomy - because she has young children and much to live for , saying she did n't want the chance of a second bout hanging over her she wrote on her blog : ' on thursday , november 14 , i will go into surgery where my doctors will perform a bilateral mastectomy followed by reconstructive surgery			1
' only then will i know more about what that fight will fully entail , but i am mentally and physically as prepared as anyone can be in this situation			0
' and while everyone who gets cancer is clearly unlucky , i got lucky by catching it early , and there are so many people to thank for making sure i did			2
