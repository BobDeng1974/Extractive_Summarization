a coalition row over the tax rate for high earners erupted today as @entity4 @entity3 insisting it will be cut to 40p ‘ over my dead body ’			1
the chief secretary to the treasury said he would never allow it to happen ahead of the 2015 election			1
but @entity12 @entity11 mayor @entity10 said the current 45p rate was not reasonable , and warned the @entity4 about make bold threats because the last thing he wanted to see was ‘ the dead body of @entity3 ’			1
@entity4 treasury minister @entity3 ( left ) said he would not allow @entity12 chancellor @entity17 to give in to pressure from senior conservatives to signal a further cut in the top rate of tax to 40p the future of the tax rate paid by people earning more than £ 150,000 has become a major political battleground			1
in the last weeks of the @entity29 government then - chancellor @entity27 increased it from 40p to 50p			1
@entity12 chancellor @entity17 then cut it to 45p in 2012 , claiming the measure had raised ‘ next to nothing ’ for the @entity33			1
@entity35 has vowed to return it to 50p if @entity29 wins the next election , but @entity38 are pushing for it to be reduced further to 40p			1
however mr @entity3 , the second most senior @entity4 in the government , refused to yield to the @entity12 demands			2
@entity11 mayor @entity10 said the @entity4 should not make hollow threats that they can not keep ‘ i think it is right at 45 per cent			0
i would n't go to cutting below 45 per cent , ’ he told the @entity42			0
‘ i would say that would happen over my dead body			0
’ at prime minister ’s questions last week @entity46 refused to rule out a further cut , insisting only that his priority for expensive tax cuts were those on low and middle incomes			2
asked about the @entity38 ’ ambiguity , mr @entity3 said : ‘ you 'll have to ask them why they answer those questions in those ways			2
‘ if you ask me would i cut the top rate below 45p the answer is “ no ”			1
in this @entity63 we will not allow that to happen			0
’ however , the @entity12 have refused to rule out promising a further cut , believing it will help to attract investors and entrepreneurs to the @entity68			2
mr @entity10 warned the @entity4 against threats about blocking a cut which might be difficult tostand by			0
‘ the last thing i want to see is pointless sacrifice from the @entity4 , let alone the dead body of @entity3 , ’ the @entity11 mayor told @entity73 ’s today programme			0
‘ who can say what will happen to @entity3 ? stranger things have happened at sea			0
‘ i do n’t think it is reasonable always to keep @entity68 tax rates higher than those of competitor countries			0
‘ @entity68 income tax is now higher than the average in the @entity87 ; that never used to be the case , i do n’t see why that should be the case for the long term and i do n’t see any reason why we should n’t bring it down			0
’ he said he could not ‘ believe ’ that the @entity38 will go into the next election in 2015 promising to keep tax rates higher than other countries			2
however @entity29 attacked mr @entity3 for supporting the cut from 50p to 45p			1
@entity97 , shadow chief secretary to the treasury , said : ' @entity3 seems to have forgotten that just 10 months ago he cut the top rate of tax for the top 1 per cent of earners			1
' and that was after saying anybody who wanted to do this was living in " cloud cuckoo land "			0
' @entity29 will reverse this tax cut for millionaires as we balance the books in the next @entity63 in a fairer way			2
it tells you everything you need to know about @entity46 and @entity17 that they have n't ruled out cutting the top rate of tax again			0

chief secretary to the treasury vows to block any @entity12 moves to cut more
anyone earning more than £ 150,000 currently pays 45p rate
@entity29 wants to return it to 50p and many @entity38 want cut to 40p
