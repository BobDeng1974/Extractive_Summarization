by @entity1 reporter a deadly leopard stunned tourists by catching and then ' befriending ' a frightened impala			1
the big cat seemed to shelve its predator instincts as it played and licked the young fawn			2
the rarely seen interaction was caught on camera by game ranger @entity10 , 29 , in @entity12 , @entity13			1
cuddling up : the young leopard rests its paw on an impala in @entity12 , in what tourists thought might be an extraordinary show of friendship between predator and prey friend for dinner : this leopard seems to play affectionately with an impala in @entity12 ... but the cordial relationship did n't last long mr @entity10 said : ' this was clearly far more of a game for the leopard than it was for the impala - but some moments could almost have been misinterpreted as bonding between the two			1
' unfortunately the friendship was not to last and the leopard eventually got bored with its own game and ate the impala			2
the cat was well - known to rangers as a newly independent hunter named @entity42 - meaning lucky			2
her mother had died from a severe infection caused by a wounded ear , which had actually been inflicted by @entity42			0
strange bedfellows : tourists at @entity12 , in @entity13 were amazed when predator appear to befriend prey where do you think you 're going ! the impala realises this friendship may not last and attempts to make a bid for freedom only to be firmly held in place by the hungry leopard mr @entity10 was with safari guests when they found the young female carrying a live baby impala in her jaws			1
the 22 - month - old leopard dropped the exhausted impala on the ground and waited for it to try and run away before pouncing on it again			0
it would then repeat the game			0
at one point the impala managed to escape by running underneath the tourists ' @entity71 , where the leopard was too timid to approach			0
bid for freedom : the young impala , clearly showing the injuries from its struggle with the leopard , momentarily escapes the predator 's clutches normal service resumed : the temporary truce is brought to a violent end in front of stunned tourists as the leopard again grabbs hold of the impala @entity90 , from @entity91 , said : ' i had to make a decision			1
it was not my role to interfere so i decided to reverse and the leopard moved in again to reclaim her prize			0
' whenever the impala got up to run off , some of the guests would cheer it on , hoping that it would run away to safety , but the leopard was too quick and agile for this ending to ever come to fruition			0
' mr @entity10 said it was the first time he had seen this behaviour in his six years at the @entity108 and more than 20 years visiting the area			2
he added : ' it was a touch sad , as it is never a pleasing experience to watch an animal suffer , but at the same time it was a truly remarkable experience to watch this rare behaviour first - hand			0
' in for the kill : the young leopard finally decides to carry the impala in its jaws off into the undergrowth of @entity12 to eat dinner time : the helpless impala lies motionless at the big cat prepares to devour its prey - all caught on camera by a tourist in @entity12 , @entity13			1
