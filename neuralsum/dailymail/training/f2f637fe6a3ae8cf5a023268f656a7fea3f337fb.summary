by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:58 est , 13 april 2013 updated : 19:07 est , 13 april 2013 out : @entity2 was once a pivotal figure in @entity4 advising @entity5 the architect of @entity5 ’s policy on gay marriage is leaving @entity9 after losing a power battle with the prime minister ’s new election supremo			1
@entity2 , mr @entity5 ’s personal polling guru and a key modernising figure at @entity4 , is returning to his private business after being usurped by outspoken @entity16 ‘ fixer ’ @entity17			1
mr @entity2 , who became director of government strategy two years ago , is a former member of the now defunct @entity19 and lobbied mr @entity5 to ditch traditional right - wing @entity21 values and policies on @entity23 , tax and crime in a bid to ‘ detoxify ’ the @entity21 ’ ‘ @entity28 ’ image			1
in contrast , mr @entity17 , who took charge of the @entity21 campaign machine in january on a £ 200,000 - a - year deal , specialises in ‘ dog whistle ’ tactics – subtle appeals to voters ’ underlying prejudices over issues such as immigration – which are designed to appeal to core @entity21 voters			2
@entity41 mr @entity17 denies using ‘ dog - whistle ’ tactics to send surreptitious messages , saying : ‘ it was more like a foghorn			0
’ he is understood to have been critical of mr @entity5 ’s policy on gay marriage for alienating grassroots supporters			0
mr @entity2 , co-founder of the @entity51 polling company , helped persuade mr @entity5 that while gay marriage would lose votes among older party supporters in safe seats , more importantly it would attract votes in marginal constituencies			1
when mr @entity17 ’s appointment was announced , mr @entity2 denied threatening to resign			1
however , he is to leave his @entity9 post to return to @entity51 , though he is expected to do some part - time work for @entity61			0
last night , a @entity21 source said : ‘ there was never going to be room for both @entity2 and @entity17			1
@entity2 is a fully paid - up @entity21 moderniser and believes that the party will never win a governing majority again unless it distances itself from its @entity69 past			0
@entity17 is an old - fashioned @entity69 who thinks traditional values and policies are more important than modern fads			0
’ success : @entity17 was formerly campaign chief for @entity75 mayor @entity74 mr @entity2 ’s critics claim he places too much reliance on @entity79 - style focus groups			1
his supporters say the same techniques helped @entity82 win three elections and insist it is ‘ totally unfair ’ to blame him for the so - called ‘ omnishambles ’ – the series of u-turns – which followed last year ’s chaotic budget			0
electoral dynamite : @entity17 helped @entity90 in @entity16 win four elections mr @entity2 warned mr @entity5 that it would be ‘ toxic ’ to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p , following focus group findings that the prime minister and his chancellor were seen as ‘ posh ’ and ‘ out of touch ’ characters from tv period drama @entity97			1
in the end , the government compromised by cutting it to 45p			0
mr @entity17 was dubbed @entity105 after winning four terms for former @entity16 pm @entity90 and is billed as one of the most brilliant , though provocative , strategists of his generation			1
in one notorious campaign ploy in 2001 , he seized on the news that a refugee ship , packed with @entity114 asylum seekers , had entered @entity16 waters			0
mr @entity90 , on mr @entity17 ’s advice , refused the passengers entry amid claims that they were trying to blackmail their way in by throwing children overboard			2
the allegations turned out to be false but the controversy boosted mr @entity90 ’s ratings and he gained more credit when , shortly afterwards , @entity126 extremists attacked @entity127 on 9/11			0
four years later , mr @entity17 had moved to @entity128 to advise @entity129 , whose 2005 general election campaign was noted for highlighting immigration			2
although mr @entity90 was beaten by mr @entity82 , mr @entity17 was credited for avoiding a third landslide defeat			2
he went on to mastermind @entity74 ’s two victories in the @entity75 mayoral elections and mr @entity74 urged mr @entity5 to do ‘ whatever it takes ’ to hire mr @entity17 to run the @entity138 ’ 2015 election campaign			1
‘ push the boat out , break the piggy bank , kill the fatted calf , ’ said the mayor			0
however , not all of mr @entity74 ’s advisers were so impressed			0
the @entity145 revealed last year how some were shocked when mr @entity17 said mr @entity74 should stop focusing on ‘ f * * * ing @entity148 ’			2
shift : @entity17 wants @entity5 , left , to focus on traditional values like @entity151 , right admirers have hailed his appointment to mr @entity5 ’s team for bringing ‘ discipline , clarity , toughness and populism ’ to @entity155			2
however , the party ’s former deputy chairman lord @entity160 , a long - standing political and business rival of the @entity16 , said mr @entity5 had made a mistake and called mr @entity17 ‘ a distracting influence ’			1
a no 10 source played down mr @entity2 ’s resignation and said : ‘ @entity2 always planned to return to his business around this time and will carry on doing some work for the @entity21			0

@entity2 , a key modernising figure for @entity5 had quit @entity4
@entity16 @entity17 is now at the helm to secure the next election
@entity17 has helped @entity74 and @entity16 pm @entity90 to victory
