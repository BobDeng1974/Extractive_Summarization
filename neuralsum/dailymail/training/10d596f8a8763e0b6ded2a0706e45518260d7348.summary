outrage : @entity0 has sparked anger and been accused of ' promoting slavery ' by creating a new pair of trainers which have bright orange ' shackles ' that fit around the wearer 's ankles controversial : many have said the shoes have connotations of the slave trade ( left ) and prisoners ( right ) one , ‘ @entity38 ’ , said : ‘ it ’s offensive and inappropriate in many ways … how would a @entity42 person feel if they decided to have a shoe with a swastika on it and tried to claim it was ok in the name of fashion ? ’ dr @entity50 , writing for @entity52 , said : ' shackles			1
the stuff that our ancestors wore for 400 years while experiencing the most horrific atrocities imaginable			2
' most of which were never documented in the history books and kept away from you in the educational system , all so you 'd be willing to put shackles on your ankles today and not be so sensitive about it			1
' the professor at @entity67 said he accepted some people would accuse him of overreacting			2
but he added : ' there is always a group of negroes who are more than happy to resubmit themselves to slavery			2
anger : more than 2,000 people have labelled the design ' offensive ' and ' ignorant ' and say the firm has ' sunk to new lows ' in its ' slavewear ' product ' i 'm offended by these shoes as there is nothing funny about the prison industrial complex , which is the most genocidal thing to happen to the black family since slavery itself			1
' others have likened the shoes ' orange ' bracelets ' to the shackles worn by prisoners across the @entity96 , or said the firm is ' promoting slavery '			1
@entity38 added : ' regardless if the company was saying the shoes are so hot you have to chain them to you , or they were capitalising on the whole prison style popularity			0

it seems @entity0 did not want to be outdone by fierce competitor @entity110 in the controversial shoe design stakes			1
controversial : @entity110 has provoked outrage by launching a new @entity114 line of trainers for @entity116 in march , @entity110 was accused of ' huge insensitivity ' for launching a £ 70 ' beer - themed ' trainer called ' @entity120 ' in time for @entity116			0
the firm apologised , saying it was an innocent name designed to chime with the often boozy celebrations for @entity125 's patron saint			1
to others , however , it was a historical affront reviving bitter memories of a @entity130 unit sent to @entity125 to suppress revolt in the 1920s			0
that is because the @entity134 was the nickname given to the @entity134 , which became notorious for a brutal crackdown during the independence war			0

an advertisement for the shoe says : ‘ tis the season for @entity138 beer and why not celebrate with @entity110			0
crackdown : @entity130 police , known as @entity134 for their mix - and - match military outfits of dark wool and khaki , hold a suspected @entity154 member at gunpoint and search him for weapons ‘ @entity120 sneaker takes inspiration for the fine balancing act of a stout on top a pale ale in a pint glass			0

six years ago ice cream firm @entity165 ’s caused a furore when it launched a @entity114 flavour			0

athough only deployed from 1920 to 1922 , nationalist @entity125 still associates the @entity134 with murder , brutality , massacre and indiscipline in the years leading to southern @entity125 's independence historians say there is no dispute that ' the @entity178 ' killed and destroyed on a large scale , and recorded that when a @entity134 was killed in @entity180 , they burnt down more than 300 buildings			2
the catholic cardinal of the day called them ' a horde of savages , some of them simply brigands , burglars and thieves ' .			0
