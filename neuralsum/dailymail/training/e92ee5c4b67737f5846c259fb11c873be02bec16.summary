by @entity0 published : 13:25 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 14:45 est , 9 july 2013 pickup drivers should be on alert after newly released research revealed the top ten most stolen vehicles in the country is dominated by trucks			1
a popular misconception is that sports cars and luxury vehicles dominate such a list , but research released by the @entity12 shows thieves are most interested in pickups			2
the research , released tuesday , covers the period 2010 to 2012 and is based on insurance @entity16 accounted for the first five vehicles on the list and the most stolen of all is the @entity21 pickup , a heavy - duty version of the top - selling @entity21 that is popular with contractors			1
popular model : the @entity27 diesel pickup truck has been named the most popular vehicle to be stolen on average , 1.2 of every 1,000 insured vehicles are reported stolen in the @entity30 in a given year			1
however the @entity21 had a claim frequency of seven per 1,000 insured vehicles , almost six times the average			1
the @entity21 replaces the @entity34 , which had been the most stolen vehicle for the past six years in a row			1
the @entity34 fell to sixth on the list , a drop attributed partly to the @entity40 ’s improved anti-theft features and partly due to declining sales			0
the top ten is also dominated by vehicles manufactured by @entity44 , with the other two entries being @entity46			0
theft rates in general are declining , thanks in large part to the spread of ignition immobilizers , which prevent vehicles from being hot - wired and were standard in 89 percent of 2012 models			0
formerly the most most stolen vehicle for the past six years , the @entity34 fell to sixth on the list , a drop attributed to the @entity40 's improved anti-theft features and declining sales the @entity21 has replaced the @entity34 as the favorite target of thieves , the @entity59 ( @entity60 ) reports the @entity63 tops the list for the least - stolen vehicles , which tend to be less popular models fewer pickups than cars or suvs have the feature as standard , which may help explain the higher theft rates for pickups			1
pickups and large suvs are also expensive to buy , so it reasons that thieves would want to chop them up for parts to sell them on the black market			0
the rankings also do n’t distinguish whether or not the entire car was stolen , or if the car was simply broken into			0
since it is probably easier to steal something from the bed of a truck this may also go some way to explaining the number of dominance of trucks in the top ten			0
the best way to defeat car thieves may be simply to buy a vehicle nobody else wants			0
the @entity12 has also compiled a list of the least - stolen vehicles			1
the @entity99 pickup is the second most stolen vehicle with 6.7 per 1,000 insured this list is dominated by relatively unpopular products or lower - volume luxury models , such as the @entity104			1
but there also are some more popular vehicles , like the @entity107 , ranked seventh from the bottom , that may benefit from improved anti-theft technologies			0
for car buyers , it might be tempting to consider a vehicle that ’s least likely to be stolen , but it ’s worth keeping in mind that thieves probably ignore some cars because they ’re not worth much and there may simply be little demand for its parts			2
@entity120 stopped selling the @entity121 because of poor sales			0
the @entity63 and @entity123 are weak sellers that will soon be discontinued as well , reports @entity125			2
the @entity104 is another car that features on the list of vehicles rarely stolen			2

the five most stolen vehicles in the @entity30 are all pickup trucks
a @entity21 is six time more likely to be stolen than the national average
the least stolen vehicle is the @entity63
