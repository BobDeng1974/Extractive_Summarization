new @entity1 president @entity0 is set to earn £ 1.8million in pay and perks over the next five years , following @entity5 's failure to block his appointment last week			1
the former @entity8 prime minister will head up the powerful @entity9 until 2019 following his election by @entity12 leaders on friday			1
mr @entity0 , 59 , a veteran @entity13 fixer who favours a @entity14 of @entity12 , will earn £ 245,629.70 a year - almost double mr @entity5 's £ 142,000 pay packet			1
millionaire former @entity8 pm @entity0 will pocket almost £ 2million over the next five years the salary is topped up by a ' residential allowance ' of £ 184,222.25 over five years and can look forward to a £ 52,500 - a - year pension for life , figures published in the @entity17 reveal			1
details of mr @entity0 's pay packet will spark further controversy in @entity25 following his controversial appointment last week in the face of furious resistance by mr @entity5			1
the prime minister was left humilated after @entity1 leaders voted 26 to two in favour of mr @entity0 , leaving @entity25 closer to the exit door			1
speaking after mr @entity0 's appointment , mr @entity5 admitted keeping @entity25 in the @entity1 had been made ' harder ' by the decision to ignore his opposition			1
he said the appointment had been a ' huge step backwards ' , but added : ‘ frankly , sometimes you have to be ready to lose a battle in order to win a war			0
’ health secretary @entity42 today backed mr @entity5 's claim that the development had left @entity25 closer to leaving @entity12			1
his remarks came after polls showed @entity25 voters agreed that it was now more likely the @entity25 will cut its ties with @entity13			1
according to the @entity52 poll for @entity53 , a total of 47 per cent want to leave the @entity1 , with 39 in favour of staying in			1
asked how they would vote in a referendum if mr @entity5 fails to get a better deal for @entity25 , the number who want to leave rises to 49 per cent , while those wishing to stay in falls to 31 , a massive 18 - point margin			1
however , if mr @entity5 defies the odds and persuades mr @entity0 to restore some of @entity25 ’s sovereignty , the @entity25 could yet stay in @entity12			1
a total of 41 per cent would vote to stay in in such circumstances , with a hardcore of 37 resolutely in favour of leaving			0
he also attacked @entity1 leaders for saying they would oppose mr @entity0 in private only to then support him publicly			2
former @entity92 chancellor @entity91 said mr @entity5 had thrown away his negotiating hand with the @entity1 - but may try to convince the public he has achieved a fundamental renegotiation			1
he said mr @entity5 ' might do a @entity96 ' but questioned whether the public would vote to stay in like 1975			2
' what @entity96 did , and @entity5 is following in his footsteps , he said that he did n't agree with the terms that @entity101 had negotiated , he was going to renegotiate the terms and then he put it to the people in a referendum			0
' through the long renegotiation , we got absolutely damn all – indeed , i doubt there 's anyone alive today who can remember what he did get out of it , it was so trivial – but he presented it as a great success , and people bought it			0
' i think @entity5 could try to do the same ; he will get very little and he will present it as something			0
' speaking to the @entity121 on sunday , @entity91 said mr @entity5 should have threatened to campaign for @entity25 to leave the @entity1 as a way of strengthening his negotiating position with fellow @entity12 leaders			1
instead , the prime minister had ' made it quite clear that he does n't want to exit … so he has no negotiating hand to speak of ' , @entity91 said			0
asked whether the prime minister could threaten to withdraw in the run - up to the referendum , @entity91 said : ' yes , but he has n't			0
that is what 's surprising , that he 's made it quite clear that he does n't want to exit , which does n't strengthen his negotiating hand			2
' if @entity5 had said , " well , i 'm not sure how to vote			0
it depends on what i am able to negotiate " , that would have been a stronger hand			0
' but he 's actually made it clear he 's going to vote for " in " irrespective , so he has no negotiating hand to speak of			0
' mr @entity42 said : ' as a result of cowardice yesterday from other leaders who were n't prepared to stand up in public and say the things they had said in private , they 're going to have to work a lot harder to persuade the @entity25 people that @entity12 can be trusted with a proper reform agenda			2
' this morning the foreign secretary @entity73 refused to say if he thought it would be a disaster if @entity25 left the @entity1			1
he said the ' objective ' should be to overhaul @entity25 's relationship with the @entity1 in order to stay in			1
but mr @entity73 said : ' the @entity25 people will decide if that is sustainable or not			2
' but mr @entity5 's failure in @entity12 was this morning attacked by @entity157 , who accused the prime minister of being ' cack handed '			1
shadow chancellor @entity72 said the week 's events had been a ' catastrophe for @entity25 and the @entity25 national interest '			1
he told @entity164 's the @entity163 : ' what is @entity5 's @entity12 policy ? does he think we should be in @entity12 , i do			2
' i think that we will only be influential in the world if we are influential in @entity12			0
does he want reform ? he says he does but he ca n't tell us what his reforms are			0
' ' he 's weak , he 's lost control , he 's on the back foot , @entity25 is suffering			2
i think it 's catastrophic for @entity25			0
' mr @entity72 added : ' i 've never seen a negotiation so cack - handed			2
' labour leader @entity177 went further - claiming that the @entity178 now posed a ' real and present danger ' to the @entity25 economy			0
the @entity157 leader said the ' debacle ' over mr @entity0 's nomination had taken the @entity25 closer to the ' exit door ' that could put three million jobs and tens of thousands of businesses at risk			1
he said : ' the lesson of the @entity0 debacle is that @entity5 and the @entity92 now pose a real and present danger to our economy			2
' he could not build alliances and his threats succeeded only in turning a @entity12 that was divided over the best candidate for commission president into a @entity12 united against him			0
' there can be no better indicator of how a @entity92 government would damage @entity25 's national interest and @entity25 's businesses if it were to win a second term next year			0
' he added : ' but the isolation he achieved this week is not " splendid "			0
it shows he is incapable of reforming @entity12 and his strategy of getting change by making threats to leave to get change does not work			0
' all it does is take @entity25 closer to an exit door through which three million @entity25 jobs and tens of thousands of businesses could disappear			1
' business chief @entity214 said the country 's economic success depended on it remaining a full member of the @entity1			2
the @entity219 director general said : ' the @entity1 is our biggest export market and remains fundamental to our economic future			0
our membership supports jobs , drives growth and boosts our international competitiveness			0
alternatives to full membership of the @entity1 simply would n't work			0
