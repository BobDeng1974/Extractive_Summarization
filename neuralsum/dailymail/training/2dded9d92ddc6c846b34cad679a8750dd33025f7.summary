mr @entity1 , 33 , from @entity4 , is the world ’s fastest backwards runner and incredibly , is able to cover a mile in just over seven minutes			1
and after being crowned world champion for three years on the trot , he is returning to the @entity8 backwards running championships , held in @entity10 tomorrow , to defend his title			2
and despite constant stares from baffled passers - by , he discovered he could run nearly as fast backwards as he could forwards - and claims his life has been transformed by the craze			0
mr @entity1 said : ' backwards running is like a drug , once you start , you ’ll never want to run forwards again			1
' it ’s truly liberating , and there are enormous health benefits			0
it ’s much better for your body than running forwards , as it ’s lower impact			1
talented : mr @entity1 competed in his first backwards running race at the @entity8 championships in @entity10 in 2009 and now competes all the time ' people usually have to do a double take when they see me whizzing past when i ’m training			1
' i ’m always getting passers - by shouting at me , telling me i ’m going the wrong way			0
' but who says i ’m going the wrong way and everyone else is going the right way ? ' mr @entity1 competed in his first backwards running race at the @entity8 championships in @entity10 in 2009			1
he regularly trains across the @entity8 , and has been training in @entity46 and @entity47 on the run up to this weekend ’s big race			0
speedy : mr @entity1 claims to have only fallen three times since he started running backwards but he does admit to taking a forwards - running friend with him to act as his eyes despite the obvious trip hazards , mr @entity1 claims to have only fallen three times since he started running backwards			1
however , he does admit to taking a forwards - running friend with him to act as his eyes when he trains on unfamiliar or busy terrain			0
mr @entity1 , who gave up his job as a bicycle rickshaw operator and now tours schools in a bid to convert children to backwards running , had always been a keen jogger			1
but it was only when he was forced to turn away from the glaring sun on an evening jog that he ever thought about going backwards			0
he explained : ' the sun was so bright i had to turn away , but i did n’t want to turn round and go home			0
' i just thought i ’d try facing the other direction and running backwards for a while and it was great			1
' my body felt much better after running backwards as well , and i went and researched backwards running properly			1
wrong way round : mr @entity1 regularly trains across the @entity8 , and has been training in @entity46 and @entity47 on the run up to this weekend 's big race in @entity10 ' i could n’t believe how many people around the world were into it and there were so many competitions to enter			2
' mr @entity1 has travelled the world entering backwards running competitions and has been crowned champion in cities across the @entity8 and @entity83 , as well as in international games held in @entity85			1
he completed the mile - long @entity8 championship in 2010 in an impressive time of seven minutes 30 seconds			2
and last month , he finished the @entity89 half marathon in an astonishing time of just one hour 40 minutes after running all of it backwards			2
mr @entity1 is now dedicating his life to converting people to backwards running and claims the health benefits alone are enough to convince people to give it a go			2
he said : ' you burn three times as many calories running backwards as running forwards , as it uses a lot more muscles			1
' you land on the correct part of your feet , which helps your ligaments and ankle bones			0
champion : mr @entity1 is now dedicating his life to converting people to backwards running and claims the health benefits alone are enough to convince people to give it a go ' in forwards running , your feet land heel to toe but when you run backwards it ’s the other way round , which is how you ’re supposed to run , the same way as you would barefoot			2
' and instead of the muscles in your lower back getting the workout , it ’s the muscles in your lower abdomen that are worked the hardest			0
' backwards running also improves your posture and encourages you to stand and run with your shoulders back			2
' if it was n’t for people being too embarrassed to run backwards , it would be a lot better for everyone to do it			0
' the organiser of the @entity8 championships , held in @entity136 , @entity10 tomorrow , @entity137 said : ' most of the people who enter our races do it for a bit of fun , but there are a handful of dedicated backwards runner out there who train all year round and never miss a race			0
' i can tell you from personal experience that unless you have trained for months beforehand , your legs will know they ’ve been through a stiff workout and to even manage the whole race without resorting to a slow shuffle would be a massive achievement			0
“ it ’s a little - known fact that backward running is not only a great workout , but can actually prevent injury and is a very valuable exercise for athletes rehabilitating from knee injuries			0
