by @entity0 from people chewing with their mouths open to those who crack their knuckles , we all have certain sounds that grate on our nerves			1
but for one man , the sound of popping gum , cracking ice or the innocent flick of a lighter can trigger the most irrational anger			1
@entity13 , 39 , has misophonia , which literally means ‘ hatred of sound , ’ despite being a musician			1
scroll down for music @entity13 , 39 , has @entity19 , which literally means ' hatred of sound , ' despite being a musician			1
he ca n't bear noises including popping bubblegum and crunching ice cubes and becomes tense and angry the it worker , who lives in @entity26 , can not bear certain noises and immediately become tense and has violent thoughts upon hearing them			1
people with misophonia typically have an aversion to quiet everyday noises such as sniffing , clicking and crunching – even breathing – and they react involuntarily			1
mr @entity13 remembers the first time he realised that his reactions to annoying sounds were different from anyone else 's			1
aged 14 , he was watching a film on tv when he heard his father scraping the final dregs of ice cream out of a bowl			0
he told @entity44 : ‘ i spun around and asked - to my @entity46 's surprise - “ do i need to pause the tape ? ” ’ , ' adding that was probably his mildest reaction			0
‘ it ’s got worse and worse			0
i did n’t know how to explain what i was going through and it registered as pain			1
’ after it was apparent that he was acting abnormally , his parents took him to an audiologist who said his hearing was normal			0
instead , his problem with certain noises was ‘ all in the head ’			1
it felt like my parents did n’t trust me , ’ he said			0
it was not until 2010 that he was eventually diagnosed him with misophonia			1
he could n't afford the experimental treatments available ' in wallet or spirit , but just knowing there was a name for it and that i was n't some isolated freak case , helped immensely			0
' to help other people understand @entity19 , mr @entity13 has written a song called two people made this mess to express how sounds make him feel			1
he says that music and the guitar does not annoy him when he , or someone else is playing it , unless the instrument is out of tune having lived with the condition for around 25 years – many people first experience problems when they hit puberty – he now knows what the worst sound triggers are and methods to cope with them			1
‘ @entity93 , [ his worst trigger ] is huge , ’ mr @entity13 said			1
people scraping bowls and chewing with their mouths open are also intolerable - and he ca n’t bear to be next to them			1
mr @entity13 said : ‘ you see red			1
the pain i feel is part of the feeling when you ’re being attacked			0
it feels like you ’re under threat			0
‘ i used to hate it when people opened and shut @entity108 lighters in bars - although that does n’t happen as many bars have banned smoking – and popcorn is bad			2
’ ‘ i love movies but i have to sit at the back of the cinema away from the popcorn noise – and move if someone sits nearby			2
’ gum chewing and people crunching on ice cubes are also big triggers for him			2
explaining how gum chewing makes him feel , mr @entity13 said : ‘ as soon as someone opens a packet of gum , the anxiety ramps up			1
' if someone ’s chewing with their mouth closed , its fine			2
but if they chew loudly with their mouth open i do n’t know what to do			0
and if they pop the gum , a conversation starts			0
‘ i visibly react – my body does a thing that they notice			0
' sometimes people take offence when i ask them to stop , and i tell them about my condition			2
but if they do n't understand and stop , then they 're an ass and i move away			0
’ he sometimes feels incredibly angry and has come close to violence on one occasion , which prompted him to explore anger management techniques , which are common for people with misophonia to use			1
once , for example , a young co-worker deliberately crunched an ice cube in his ear - after he asked them to stop chewing on it			2
' i immediately sprung out of my seat and adopted an aggressive pose – despite being opposed to violence , ' he said			2
‘ that was the closest i ’ve been to violence , ’ he admitted			2
‘ i had to think about my anger and how to tone it down ’			2
as well as controlling negative emotions , he has found other methods of coping with misophonia			2
‘ you learn to live with it - and you can get headphones that block sounds			0
maybe you also have a few less friends as some people do n’t understand , ’ he said			0
the condition has cost him some relationships , too			1
‘ before my fiancé , i was with a woman i loved and i realised i could n’t be a husband or father without finding a way to get rid of my hang - ups [ about sounds she made ] ’			2
@entity19 literally means ' hatred of sound ' and can be a hypersensitivity to background noise that does not generally bother other people			1
different people have different triggers , which prompt a negative emotional response			0
triggers include : chewing , sucking , teeth grinding , soft breathing , raspy voices , yawning , clicking on keyboards , writing sounds , plastic wrappers , animal noises , tv and body noises			1
sufferers can experience acute annoyance , discomfort or even rage and panic when hearing a noise , while some become agitated , defensive or offensive			2
others with the condition stay away from other people and experience relationship difficulties to avoid a ' trigger '			0
sometimes the people who are closest to a sufferer are those who make the most unbearable sounds			0
people with misophonia can feel guilty about their reactions , which can include rage			1
source : @entity223 his fiancé , @entity226 , a social worker , loves bubble gum but does n’t pop it in mr @entity13 ’s presence			1
‘ she ’s very conscious of the triggers and goes to great pains to keep the house safe for me			0
she apologises when she makes a noise that ’s a trigger			0
it takes a very understanding soul to cope , ’ he said			0
to help other people understand @entity19 , mr @entity13 has written a song called @entity237 as well as an album two people made this mess to express how sounds make him feel			1
‘ i wrote it so that it might help my friends understand – and other @entity245 and their families understand – and maybe to deal with it in a cathartic way			0
’ interestingly , he explained that music and the guitar does not annoy him when he , or someone else is playing it , unless the instrument is out of tune			0
‘ but there ’s a @entity257 track where he cracks a tambourine very close to the microphone to deliberately ramp up the tension – and it works			0
i ' love that song but i have to turn that part down or skip it completely as it gets me into a very angry place , ’ he said .			0

@entity13 , 39 , has misophonia , which literally means ' hatred of sound '
he flies into fits of rage at the sound of someone eating popcorn or chewing
at times , he has been so *enraged* he has nearly *resorted* to violence
for years , no one knew why he reacted to everyday noises so *extremely*
the condition has made forming relationships and friendships difficult
he now uses anger management and earphones to control the condition
has now written a song about his condition to try and explain it to others
