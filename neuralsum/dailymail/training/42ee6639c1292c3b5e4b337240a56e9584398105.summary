by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will follow the example of footballers such as @entity5 and @entity6 and wear a protective face mask to ensure that he can play in the final test at @entity9 despite breaking his nose in two places at @entity12			1
the nasty blow broad took when he top - edged a bouncer from @entity15 into the gap between the peak of his helmet and grille during @entity21 ’s thumping fourth @entity23 win looked to have ruled him out of the series climax			1
yet @entity2 , man of the match at @entity12 , emerged from a @entity28 hospital after missing @entity30 ’s startling collapse and ruled out reconstructive surgery before insisting he will be fit to play , complete with a mask , on friday			1
‘ @entity54 did a great job with the stitches			0
on to @entity9 ( with a mask )			0
’ it is a boost for @entity21 , who on sunday named an unchanged 13 - man squad for their final test , with @entity62 retaining his place once it became clear that @entity64 would not return in time from injury			2
@entity2 , sublime in @entity30 ’s first innings at @entity12 with six for 25 , faces an operation on his right knee that will rule him out for four months after this series and desperately wanted to be given the all - clear for @entity9			1
his injury , on the fastest pitch of the summer , came as he tried to pull the lively @entity15 for a third successive six but only succeeded in finding a gap in his modern @entity75 helmet that will soon be closed by new safety regulations			1
@entity2 fell to his haunches and @entity79 called for urgent assistance as @entity30 ’s players quickly forgot the animosity between the sides to ensure that their opponent was not seriously hurt			0
a smile on @entity2 ’s face as he was led from the field was a sign that he was bruised but unbowed and he later revealed that he watched eight of the nine @entity91 wickets to fall spectacularly after tea on saturday from a hospital bed			0
impact : @entity2 top - edged a delivery from @entity15 into the gap between the grille and peak of his helmet @entity100 salutes victorious @entity21 effort delivery : analysis of @entity15 's 88.1mph bowl ‘ it was a big impact but if there ’s no risk we will play him , no doubt about that , ’ said @entity21 coach @entity105			1
‘ it is a big game at the @entity9 and we want him there			0
if that means playing with a football face mask so be it			0
he will have panda eyes			0
’ clearly @entity21 ’s medical staff are comfortable that there are no concussion issues with @entity2 at a time when awareness of the dangers of the condition is increasing , not least because of a @entity125 campaign			1
@entity2 ’s injury follows that suffered by @entity128 ’s @entity127 this summer when he broke his nose and fractured his eye socket after a ball from @entity132 ’ @entity133 had managed , like @entity2 ’s , to burst through his visor			1
cricketers have often lowered the grille of their helmet if they felt it was restricting their vision but new guidelines are set to outlaw that practice , particularly in light of these incidents			0
@entity144 manufacturer @entity75 claim to employ a ‘ unique air - cushioning impact system ’ , with the sharper peak of the helmet making it less likely for the ball to get between the grille and lid			0
but it did when @entity2 top - edged @entity15			1
broken bones : @entity15 's delivery crashes into @entity2 's face during the fourth test at @entity12 previous : a history of cricket 's painful blows now a new @entity157 safety standard for helmets will limit the ability of players to adjust their protective grille settings , with a maximum of 55 millimetres recommended			1
the one disappointment for @entity21 after their second consecutive huge victory is that their support seamers did not fully grab their big chance in the absence of @entity2 and with @entity168 suffering from sickness and off the field for 35 minutes of the last session			2
@entity172 may have ended the @entity23 with two wickets in two balls , and could have had a third had he not overstepped when dismissing @entity175 , but he ended up with three wickets in the match while @entity178 struck just once , the wicket of @entity181 that at least began @entity30 ’s decline			0
neither took a wicket in the third @entity23 win and while @entity21 want to provide proper opportunities to young players they will consider bringing in either @entity62 or @entity188 to their final test team			2
at least @entity2 and @entity168 will be available to carry on one of the best new - ball partnerships in @entity193 history , with @entity168 now just eight wickets away from overtaking sir @entity195 and becoming @entity21 ’s leading @entity23 wicket - taker			2
the perfect @entity193 script sees @entity168 breaking the record in an @entity9 victory with @entity2 not being restricted by his @entity201 impression			0
concern : @entity91 fielders attend to @entity2 after he was hit by the ball during day three of the fourth test			2

@entity2 broke his nose in two places during third test at @entity12
he edged a bouncer from @entity15 into the gap between the park and grille on his helmet
@entity21 's star at @entity12 ruled out reconstructive surgery after the game , insisting he was fit to play with a mask on friday
he follows in the footsteps of footballers @entity5 and @entity6 , who both played matches while wearing a protective mask
