the ratings agency left @entity50 ’s largest bank , @entity57 , on review , saying its profitability and capital base gave it an adequate cushion to support its @entity20 , @entity63 and @entity64 exposure			1
world markets rose sharply after @entity34 leaders vowed to help @entity20 avoid default in a bid to sooth trader jitters			1
the leaders of @entity20 , @entity50 and @entity71 - in a telephone conference call - agreed @entity20 was an ' integral part ' of the eurozone			1

the @entity108 industrial average rose 140.88 points , or 1.3 per cent			0
@entity110 , president of the @entity112 hedge fund @entity111 , said worries over @entity20 have gone too far because it wo n't be allowed to default			1
' they 're just not going to let them [ the @entity20 ] go under , ' he said			1
' that 's just not happening			2
i think people have learned the lesson from letting @entity120 fail			0
' despite today 's reassurances , even the most die - hard pro-europeans appear to accept that the eurozone is in terminal trouble			2
former @entity125 leader @entity125 , a long - time supporter of the single currency , asked in an interview with @entity128 whether he thought the euro could survive in its current form , replied : ‘ no , i do n’t			2
’ ‘ the most likely outcome is probably a core euro , a euro that has @entity71 , @entity134 , @entity135 and the @entity137 countries in it – you ’d have to have @entity50 in there for political reasons , even though economically they would n’t come up to the mark precisely – and maybe @entity142			1
‘ then you have a core euro and you then create the institutions to govern the euro			2
’ @entity146 , @entity147 leader in @entity148 , said : ‘ the thing is in absolute crisis			0
everybody is panicking over here			0
‘ and it seems to me the least worst option is to accept the inevitable for @entity20 to default on its debt , leave the euro and devalue its currency and then give it space to restructure ’			1
but he warned that @entity2 could be caught in the fallout as the eurozone collapses			0
@entity161 , chief economist at analysts @entity162 , said the collapse of the euro would almost certainly mean the end of the @entity12			1
‘ the @entity12 is most unlikely to continue without the euro , ’ he said			1
‘ sudden and disorderly collapse of the @entity12 would induce a massive further phase of recession			1
’ he referred to predictions by the @entity173 bank @entity172 of a 20 - 25 per cent contraction in gross domestic product for strong countries and 50 per cent for weak countries			0
‘ i happen to think that the @entity172 figures are somewhat emotional , ’ he said			0
‘ but it would certainly involve a recession on a scale beyond modern experience or comprehension in a @entity185 democracy			0
’ in an extraordinary sign of alarm across the globe , five big developing countries said they were ready to discuss bailing out @entity34			0
the leaders of @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity97 and @entity194 – the ‘ @entity196 ’ countries – are to meet at the annual @entity198 and @entity199 summit next week to talk about providing emergency assistance			0

@entity204 said : ‘ unless @entity34 , @entity85 , and the @entity17 can face up to responsibilities they will drag down not only themselves but the global economy			0
they have procrastinated for too long on taking the difficult decisions , narrowing what choices are now left to a painful few			0
’ treasury sources believe that @entity71 is now resigned to the eurozone breaking down in its current form and a new @entity34 ‘ inner core ’ being created			2
there is an increasing expectation that this will mean a new @entity12 treaty			2
@entity217 confirmed that officials were working on ‘ contingency plans ’ aimed at trying to insulate @entity2 from a full - blown crisis in the eurozone , but refused to speculate about what form they would take			0
deputy prime minister @entity224 , in a speech on the economy , warned : ‘ the economic context is much worse than before			0

@entity30 finance minister @entity236 , who will chair a meeting of @entity12 finance bosses tomorrow , said the @entity12 could be destroyed by the debt crisis			2
