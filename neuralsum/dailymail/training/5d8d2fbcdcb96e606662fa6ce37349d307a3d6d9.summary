for the fourth year running , daring dogs have descended on @entity8 in @entity9 to take part in a bizarre surfing competition			1
and while some of the four - legged contestants needed some encouragement to take to the waves , to others it seemed to be second nature			0
forty - eight dogs of all sizes took part in the contest , all seeking to impress a panel of judges with their ability on a surfboard			1
competitors - called ' @entity57 ' - got two points for lying on the board , three for sitting and five for standing on all fours			0
extra points were awarded to dogs who pulled off a manoeuvre , such as a 180 - degree or 360 - degree spin or riding backwards			2
that 's more like it : sir @entity38 successfully negotiates a big wave on his blue surfboard getting ready : two helpers prepare sir @entity38 for another adventure on the waves at @entity8 daring : sir @entity38 is helped by his owner @entity74 during the annual @entity25 competition			2
every dog which took part had to wear a life jacket soggy : a dog falls off a board during the fourth annual competition at @entity8 , @entity9 thrills and spills : a dog , carrying a camera to film the action , loses control and falls into the water soaked : a very wet dog is held by its master during the competition , which was watched by 1,500 spectators on the beach : an @entity96 bulldog stays on dry land to check out the competition and five points were on offer to the dog which completed the longest ride and negotiated the biggest wave			1
the entrants competed in four different weight categories , ranging from the extra-large section for dogs weighing 60lbs and above to the small - dog level for pooches under 20lbs			2
they had to adhere to strict rules , the most important being that every dog had to wear a life jacket			0
the festival also included a world record attempt , in which 20 dogs tried to surf a wave for five seconds simultaneously			0
crowd - puller : @entity21 bites the surf board of his master @entity119 ( left ) as a spectator watches on with a dog of her own ( right ) good dog : @entity21 stays on his board as he takes on a big wave at @entity8 , @entity9 impressing the judges : the dogs , called @entity57 , were given two points for lying down on their boards and three points for sitting in control : the dog which negotiated the biggest wave was given five points by the judging panel expert : hanzo masters another manoeuvre on the water			1
