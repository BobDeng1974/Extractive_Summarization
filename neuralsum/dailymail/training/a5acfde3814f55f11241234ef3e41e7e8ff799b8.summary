by @entity0 , chief political correspondent published : 20:40 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 20:40 est , 14 january 2014 challenge : unite general secretary @entity3 has repeatedly called for industrial action the @entity6 union has built a £ 30 million war chest to bankroll strikes in the run - up to the next election			1
leaked internal documents reveal that it has poured an extra £ 5 million into the fund in the last 18 months alone – seemingly paying lip service to the idea of settling disputes without industrial action			1
minutes from its board meeting last month also show that @entity6 – @entity20 ’s biggest donor – is stepping up pressure on party leader @entity22 to relax strike laws introduced in the wake of the industrial chaos of the 1970s			1
the disclosures are an embarrassment for mr @entity22 , who is attempting to curb the power of the unions and reassure business that a future @entity20 government would not be in their thrall in the wake of the @entity35 vote - rigging scandal			1
an internal report by @entity6 ’s finance director reveals that the union poured an extra £ 2.7 million into its strike fund in the first nine months of last year , despite spending just £ 200,000 on strike pay			1
@entity6 revealed in 2012 that it was creating a £ 25 million dispute fund to prevent employers from ‘ starving workers into submission ’			2
but the speed at which it has expanded the kitty will lead to fears about its intentions in the run - up to the election			0
general secretary @entity3 has repeatedly called for industrial action in protest at the government ’s austerity programme			1
he has said he sees ‘ disputes unfolding all over the place ’ , claiming the union needs financial clout to ‘ fight back ’			2
@entity6 has also said it needs the resources to demonstrate to employers that it ‘ means business ’ when it orders a walkout , allowing it to provide £ 30 a day in strike pay for workers involved in disputes			2
most controversially , the cash is also used to fund @entity6 ’s sinister ‘ leverage tactics ’ , which sparked controversy last year when it sent mobs of protesters to demonstrate outside the homes of directors of the @entity75 oil refinery			0
@entity77 party chairman @entity76 said : ' we need security , not strikes ... unless @entity22 gets his biggest union paymaster to act responsibly , it will be clear he 's too weak to stand up for hard - working people ' in the documents , @entity6 ’s political director @entity84 welcomed mr @entity22 ’s clear shift to the @entity87 , but warned that ‘ significant work ’ was still needed to tackle current strike policies and to build positive trade union ‘ rights and freedoms ’			1
@entity77 chairman @entity76 last night condemned the apparent bid by @entity6 to ready itself for a wave of strikes			2
‘ we need security , not strikes , ’ he said			0
‘ unless @entity22 gets his biggest union paymaster to act responsibly , it will be clear he ’s too weak to stand up for hard - working people			2
’ @entity77 mp @entity98 , deputy chairman of the @entity99 , said unite should stop its ‘ highly political ’ activity			0
the revelations come as mr @entity22 prepares to make a major climbdown following @entity6 ’s refusal to accept reforms to curb the power of the unions			0
proposals to end the controversial system in which many union members are automatically signed up as @entity20 ‘ affiliates ’ have now been delayed for at least five years			1
a ‘ special conference ’ planned for march will now last just two hours			0
@entity6 last night insisted the expansion of the strike fund did not mean it was planning a fresh wave of industrial action			0
a spokesman said : ‘ nine times out of ten disputes are resolved and industrial action avoided through negotiation with sensible employers			0
the dispute fund is there to cover things such as legal costs and support for members on those rare occasions when industrial action does occur			0
