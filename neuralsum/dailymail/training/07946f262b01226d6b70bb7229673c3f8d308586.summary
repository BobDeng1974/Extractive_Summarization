by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity2 ’s hold on live television rights to @entity4 for more than half a century could end in 2016 when their contract expires			1
tournament organisers the @entity7 , who have not considered any other tv partners for most of their 59 years with the @entity11 , are now more open to accept an offer from @entity13 , who dominate golf coverage for the rest of the year			1
@entity7 chief executive @entity17 left the door ajar for @entity13 at @entity19 two years ago when he declared it was not a foregone conclusion that the @entity2 would win the next tv contract			1
this is regarded as a game - changer on both sides of the @entity43 , with the @entity44 prepared to relinquish their long partnership with @entity47 in return for a mountain of dollars			2
and the @entity7 will not want to fall behind the money invested in the other three majors			2
@entity13 , who have shored up their golf contracts after arch - rivals @entity54 made a bid for the @entity56 , are certain to want to add to their portfolio a flagship event such as @entity4			1
and if they put enough money on the table , the likelihood is that they will			2
the @entity4 is no longer protected as a listed event that has to be shown live on terrestrial television			1
it is rated the same as home @entity68 , which moved to @entity13 in 2006 , meaning live @entity4 golf can be sold to the highest bidder provided there is provision for a terrestrial highlights show			1
those intending to visit @entity76 near the entrance to @entity78 should be warned that @entity79 , highly volatile new boss of the sports management giants , is due in @entity25 to watch @entity4			1
@entity79 chucked out former @entity76 executive @entity81 from a @entity83 hospitality area despite @entity81 having been invited in			2
strumming away : @entity84 will perform at the @entity85 2014 in september coincidentally , @entity79 ’s brother @entity86 , the mayor of @entity87 , made a mediocre speech at the gala function in his city where the 2012 @entity85 teams were introduced with the entertainment provided by @entity93 and the band @entity87			2
the mixed bag of acts for the @entity98 concert at the @entity99 ahead of the @entity101 match in september includes @entity84 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
@entity105 , former captain of @entity78 and holder of the amateur course record , has had a difficult time during the long fall - out from his horror speech at the annual golf writers ’ dinner at @entity113 in 2007			1
@entity105 , an @entity7 rules official at that tournament , made highly derogatory remarks about @entity117 golfers and black caddies			0
there is still enough sensitivity surrounding @entity105 ’s racist comments for @entity25 members to be wary of the @entity124 event			1
@entity105 has kept a low profile since 2007 but turned up for sunday lunch in the @entity25 clubhouse wearing a pair of swimming trunks			0
the next day all @entity25 members received a curt email reminding them of the dress code			0
one positive for @entity105 is that he is due to re-marry soon			0
it is hard to believe after those damning @entity135 holiday pictures , but @entity137 officials considered @entity138 to have really grown up after the exemplary way the midfielder behaved during @entity143 ’s lousy @entity142 campaign			0
puffing away : but @entity137 officials believed @entity138 had grown up on @entity143 's @entity142 campaign @entity145 , who did n’t cover the @entity142 third - place play - off for cost reasons , were due to make @entity143 commentary a one - man job following @entity152 ’s retirement			0
but @entity153 , having signed a two - year contract , will still be doubling up with new football correspondent @entity155 next season			0
return of the legend : @entity54 may well take up @entity158 on his request to cover @entity160 meanwhile , expect @entity54 to take up retiring @entity158 on his wish to do occasional guest pundit appearances on @entity160 games in the @entity164 if the @entity165 qualify for the 2015 - 16 competition			0
it ’s refreshing that forklift driver @entity168 , who qualified for @entity4 with the help of a couple of wedges he ’d never used before , does n’t believe in too professional a preparation for the event			1
@entity168 was complaining yesterday of a sizeable hangover but said he had two days to recover			0
video stunning preview of the @entity25 course			0

@entity2 have covered @entity4 for more than 50 years
@entity13 want @entity4 to add to their comprehensive golf coverage
the @entity4 no longer *ringfenced* as a terrestrial event
