two @entity1 world champions have become the latest to criticise @entity2 with regards to his attitude and comments throughout the course of the @entity7 weekend			2
@entity2 refused to acknowledge @entity9 team - mate @entity8 on the podium following the latter 's second consecutive victory around the streets of the principality			1
that followed an incident in qualifying when @entity8 brought out the yellow flags , thwarting @entity2 in his bid to claim pole at a time when he was on a quicker lap than the @entity23			1
@entity2 , though , did not disguise his displeasure at the antics of @entity8 , even though the 28 - year - old was cleared by the stewards			1
@entity9 non-executive chairman and three - times champion @entity42 chastised @entity2 after the race , suggesting that ignoring @entity8 was ' not good ' and reflected badly on the @entity9 brand			1
now @entity46 and @entity47 have waded into the debate and agree with @entity42 that @entity2 's behaviour was unbecoming			1
@entity46 , the only driver to win world titles on two and four wheels , said in his column in @entity53 : ' i have no doubt about @entity2 's driving ability , but i did n't like what i saw and heard from @entity7			1
' i can understand the frustration @entity59 must have felt in not having that opportunity on the last lap of qualifying to get pole			0
' but i think his reaction to his team - mate and team was wrong			1
' @entity47 , who won two titles with @entity68 in 1998 and 1999 , believes @entity2 displayed the attitude of a sore loser			2
in his column for @entity72 , @entity47 said : ' it 's hard to tell if something is going to change significantly ( between the drivers )			0
' i do n't know if @entity59 would even consider apologising for his behaviour			0
it is a very individual thing			0
' but in my opinion , one of the characteristics of a good winner is he also knows how to lose			0
' unimpressed : former world champion @entity47 believes @entity2 displayed the attitude of a poor loser wrong : and @entity46 ( left ) was equally unimpressed with the attitude of @entity36 at @entity7 @entity46 , now 80 , believes @entity2 was also wrong to highlight his upbringing as a source of motivation compared to that of @entity8			1
@entity2 suggested he was hungrier than @entity8 as he was raised on a council estate in @entity90 , whereas the @entity23 lived the life of luxury in @entity7			1
although @entity2 later claimed the quote was taken out of context , @entity46 feels it has only added fuel to the fire for @entity8			1
' @entity59 had said he had more motivation than @entity8 to win the world championship because of his upbringing in a flat in @entity90 as against @entity8 growing up in @entity7 , ' added @entity46			2
' if @entity8 was n't already inspired to win his first world championship , then @entity59 certainly would have provided some material for him to dig even deeper			2
' frosty : @entity2 's attitude after @entity8 's ' error ' in qualifying reflected badly and did n't help him controversial : @entity8 was forced to take to the escape road on his final run in saturday 's qualifying session @entity9 motorsport boss @entity111 , meanwhile , has downplayed claims the rivalry between the pair is starting to resemble that of @entity116 and @entity117			1
three - times champion @entity116 and four - times king @entity117 were bitter enemies during the two seasons they spent together at @entity68 in 1988 and 1989			0
on the team website , @entity111 said : ' we have seen a lot of talk about their relationship , but that 's not the key thing for a successful campaign			2
' it 's a job , not a holiday , and the drivers need to work with and for the team first of all			0
' there have been a lot of comparisons to the @entity116 / @entity140 scenario , which is a kind of compliment to both @entity59 and @entity8			0
' but the situation here is very different			0
it 's an intense relationship but this intensity is normal			0
' the racing philosophy of @entity147 is to allow our drivers to compete			0
we let the boys play with their toys , unless they break them			0
