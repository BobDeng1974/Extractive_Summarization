by @entity0 published : 18:20 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 18:25 est , 26 august 2013 in the wake of rationalist @entity3 's murder in @entity4 and a photojournalist 's gang - rape in @entity7 , a regional language news channel in @entity10 carried the pictures of chief minister @entity12 , deputy chief minister @entity13 and home minister @entity14 with the caption ' @entity16 ' ( dead )			2
it was a strong statement but one that aptly summed up the general sentiment against the government - in fact , the entire political class - across the state			1
the political leadership seems simply incapable of doing anything to stem the rot that the state had slipped into			1
law and order - its absence , to be precise - has particularly been an area of concern			1
the amount of pressure on the government can be gauged by the fact that home minister @entity14 himself went to the @entity38 police station , where the gang - rape case was registered , and was present during the interrogation of the accused			1
chief minister @entity43 , along with other cabinet members , went to pay his last respects to @entity3 and also visited the @entity7 gang - rape victim in the hospital			2
nervous that has , however , not assuaged the public anger and the @entity52 - @entity51 coalition government has been facing the @entity54 heat			1
@entity56 leader @entity55 said the two recent incidents of crime " shows that there is no law and order in the state "			1
the @entity63 , which at one time used to laud @entity14 , also slammed him and called for his resignation			0
while @entity14 's detractors in the @entity51 are happy , the top leadership is worried that his sliding performance - as that of other ministers from the party - could hurt the @entity51 's prospects in the next @entity74 and @entity75 elections			1
this nervousness is betrayed by the fact that the @entity51 , which until two years ago was flexing its muscles and planning to go it alone in the next elections , seems to have changed its mind			2
it has decided to contest in alliance with the @entity52 and on the basis of the old seat - sharing formula			1
political analyst and associate professor in the @entity87 , @entity88 , said the fact that the @entity51 has decided not to demand more seats from the @entity52 shows the party is on the back foot			1
" the two big faces of the @entity51 in the state are @entity14 and @entity13 and they have been facing flak for a number of issues - @entity14 for the law and order issue and @entity13 for his alleged involvement in the irrigation scam and his insensitive comments in the aftermath of drought			1
" thanks to these leaders , the @entity51 's image has taken a beating and that could hurt its prospects in the polls , " @entity88 said			2
poll prospects according to @entity88 , the irrigation scam and the poor law and order situation will not damage the @entity52 as much as its alliance partner			1
" the people know that @entity14 and @entity13 are the faces of the @entity51 and that they are responsible for the mess in their departments			2
also , if the @entity52 rolls out the @entity120 even by december , it could create a favourable impact among the voters , " said @entity88			1
also , @entity123 has maintained a clean image in spite of all the controversies			0
not all , however , agree			0
the anti-incumbency factor , price rise and the lack of development are some of the strong factors that go against the @entity52			2
the only solace for the ruling parties is that the @entity54 seems to be in the shambles and has not been able to capitalise on the government 's failures			0
@entity88 also feels that despite the hammering that its image has taken , the @entity51 may not face a poll rout simply because its elected representatives control @entity10 's economy through the sugar cooperatives			1
" for the @entity51 , the emphasis would be on retaining its current eight seats and then try to get more , " she said			2
if the prognosis for the ruling parties is grim , the @entity54 's prospects are not bright either			0
the @entity56 is grappling with infighting and the lack of an inspiring leader			0
its two biggest leaders in the state , @entity152 and @entity153 , are staunch rivals			0
crime scene : the @entity157 compound in @entity7 where a photojournalist was gang - raped			0
the @entity43 government has been facing the heat over rising incidents of crime in the state the situation of its ally , the @entity63 , is even worse			2
since @entity169 's death , the @entity167 fast becoming a spent force			0
@entity171 lacks the charisma of his father			0
its ties with the @entity56 have also been strained of late as it 's openly aired its unease with @entity177			0
with elections approaching , all eyes will be on @entity181 - led @entity180 , which is being courted by both the @entity56 and the @entity52			1
while the people are angry over the failure of political leadership , the political parties are only worried about the impact of some recent developments on their electoral fortunes			1
chief minister @entity43 maybe at the receiving end of all the criticism , but it would be unfair to blame him solely for all that transpires in the state			0
the @entity52 and its ally @entity51 are both in power in the state with almost equal number of seats shared between them			1
the portfolios are divided between the two in such a manner that the @entity52 does n't interfere in the departments held by the @entity51 and vice versa			1
take for example the @entity207 promise			0
@entity12 has not been able to pull up state home minister @entity14 , whose department is supposed to handle the @entity207 installation programme , because @entity14 belongs to the @entity51			1
even in the case of bad roads in the state , the chief minister has not been able to assert much as the @entity215 ( @entity216 ) and the @entity217 ( @entity217 ) are headed by @entity51 ministers			1
when the chief minister did try to intervene in the irrigation scam , it shook the stability of the government			0
last year , @entity12 had questioned how the irrigation department had spent close to rs 70,000 crore on irrigation projects but had not been able to bring even one per cent of land under cultivation			0
this led to a war of words between the chief minister and his deputy @entity13 of the @entity51			2
@entity13 had held the irrigation portfolio till a few years ago			0
the feud between them went to such an extent that @entity13 resigned as the deputy chief minister in september last year , prompting a spate of resignations from his supporters			0
while the crisis was averted and @entity13 was brought back as deputy chief minister a few days later , the issue clearly showed how the two ruling parties were actually behaving in a state of opposition and hurling charges against each other			1
@entity12 has also been constrained in his task of providing good governance from elements within his own party			0
since @entity12 took over as the chief minister , there have been at least three attempts to unseat him			0
one of attempts was led by @entity52 president @entity256			2
@entity12 despite hailing from the state does not have a support base of @entity259			0
this means that almost all factions in the @entity52 are gunning for him			2
many of his party 's ministers do not listen to him .			0

@entity51 - @entity52 coalition feels the pressure mount over high - profile crimes
opposition parties turn on the heat claiming there is ' no law and order in the state '
political parties scramble to limit the impact on their electoral campaigns
