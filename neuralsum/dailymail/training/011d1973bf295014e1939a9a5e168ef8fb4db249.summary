a new diagnostic test for the ebola virus which produces results in 15 minutes is set to be trialled in @entity3 - the epicentre of the current outbreak			1
the new test is six times faster than those currently used , and aims to speed up the diagnosis of cases			1
it will be trialled in a treatment centre in @entity12 , the @entity14 nation 's capital			1
early detection of the virus leads to better infection control as medical staff can identify and isolate confirmed cases of @entity20 faster , and start treating patients sooner			2
ultimately it is hoped a faster test will reduce the spread of the highly contagious disease , and slow the spiralling death rates			1
more than 5,600 people have died during the current outbreak , according to the @entity28			0
pictured , health workers carry a suspected patient to a centre for treatment the vast majority of victims are from @entity3 , where the epidemic started in december last year , and neighbouring @entity40 and @entity42			1
the new trial is one of six health research projects that have been jointly funded by the @entity46 and the @entity49 @entity48 's @entity47			1
led by researchers at the @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53 , the new test will be deployed using a ' mobile suitcase laboratory ' , which is designed for settings where there are few resources			0
the portable lab includes a solar panel , a power pack and a results reader , the size of a small laptop			0
the reagent substance used in the test are available as dried pellets , meaning they can be used and transported at room temperature			0
similarly to the tests currently in use , the new diagnostic tool detects the genetic material of the virus			1
the pilot trial will test whether the reagent substance is safe and effective to use with @entity20 patients ' blood and saliva samples			2
dr @entity80 , international activities manager at the @entity46 , said : ' a reliable , 15 - minute test that can confirm cases of @entity20 would be a key tool for effective management of the @entity20 outbreak - allowing patients to be identified , isolated and cared for as soon as possible			1
' it not only gives patients a better chance of survival , but it prevents transmission of the virus to other people			0
the virus has killed more than 5,600 people - the vast majority in @entity3 , @entity40 and @entity42 it is hoped the new test will help speed up diagnosis , meaning patients can be treatment quicker			1
ultimately , the aim is to slow transmission and halt the death rate			0
a suspected @entity20 patient is taken to a centre in @entity105 near @entity106 in guinea ' this pilot study is particularly promising because researchers have considered how to make the test suitable for use in remote field hospitals , where resources - such as electricity and cold storage - are often in short supply			2
' international development secretary @entity117 said : ' @entity49 's first @entity20 laboratory is already up and running in @entity40 and two more are currently being constructed			0
' together these will quadruple the number of tests that can be carried out every day and helping contain the spread of @entity20			2
' the @entity49 is doing everything possible to help the @entity48 tackle and ultimately defeat @entity20			0
' funding this ground - breaking research will develop new ways of diagnosing suspected cases even more quickly and stop more people suffering from this deadly virus			0
' funding for these projects has been made available from an existing Â£ 6.5 million research initiative , @entity133 in @entity134 ( @entity135 ) , which is jointly funded by @entity47 and the @entity46 .			0

new diagnostic tool yields results within 15 minutes , *scientists* say
it is six times faster than those currently used to test for @entity20
the new test will be trialled at a treatment centre in @entity146 , @entity3
it is hoped a faster test will reduce the spread of the disease and halt death rates , which currently total more than 5,600
trial is being funded by the @entity46 and @entity155
