female doctors provide a better quality of care than their male counterparts , according to a new study			1
@entity6 research found that female gps tended to spend longer with patients , were more likely to prescribe recommended medication and referred more patients for further examinations			1
however , it also revealed that male doctors were more ' productive ' as they treated more patients			1
@entity16 research found that female gps tended to spend longer with patients , were more likely to prescribe recommended medication and referred more patients for further examinations , compared with their male counterparts the research , which was carried out in @entity6 and compared 870 general practitioners , found the differences between men and women medics were greater among older doctors			1
scientists from the @entity16 studied the records of doctors based in @entity30 , 46 per cent of whom were women			2
they focused on the doctors ' procedures on elderly diabetic patients to see if they were in line with the recommendations of the @entity37 , which provides clear guidelines for clinical treatment of the disease			2
lead study author @entity41 said : ' women had significantly higher scores in terms of compliance with practice guidelines			0
' they were more likely than men to prescribe recommended medications and to plan required examinations			2
' the association says patients aged 65 and over with diabetes must undergo an eye exam every two years and receive three prescriptions for specific drugs , including statins			0
it also recommends patients undergo a complete medical examination annually			0
the research examined doctors ' procedures on elderly diabetic patients to see if they were in line with the recommendations of the @entity37 , which provides clear guidelines for clinical treatment of the disease the study found that among middle - aged doctors , 75 per cent of women ensured their patients had an eye examination compared to 70 per cent of men , while more women prescribed recommended medications compared to male doctors			1
a total of 68 per cent of female gps prescribed statins compared to 64 per cent of male doctors			1
patients were also more likely to undergo a complete examination if the doctor was a woman - with 39 per cent completing the examination - rather than a man , at 33 per cent			0
however , when it came to the number of patients that a doctor had seen , male gps were found to be more ' productive ' , reporting nearly 1,000 more procedures per year compared to their female counterparts			1
ms @entity41 , who carried out the research for the @entity92 , said : ' my theory was that differences between male and female practices have diminished over time			2
' it seemed to me that more and more men are taking time with their patients at the expense of productivity , and more and more women tend to increase their number of procedures			2
' the younger the doctors , the less significant the differences			0
' the study found that among middle - aged doctors , 75 per cent of women ensured their patients had an eye examination ( pictured ) compared to 70 per cent of men , while more women prescribed recommended medications compared to male doctors professor @entity115 of the @entity92 , who was also involved in the study , said it confirms that women doctors spend more time with patients			1
' people might assume that women doctors spend more time with their patients , but it is difficult to observe in a scientific study - but this study does just that			1
' he argues that this does not necessarily make female doctors less productive than male doctors who see more patients			1
professor @entity115 said : ' doctors who take the time to explain problems to their patients may avoid these patients returning after a month because they are worried about a detail			0
' more productive physicians may not be the ones we think			0
' recent figures from the @entity143 show that three out of five young doctors on @entity146 hospital wards and in @entity148 surgeries are now women			0
women made up 61 per cent of doctors under 30 last year and 46 per cent of those aged 30 to 50			0
however , men remain dominant in the oldest age group , with women comprising less than a third of doctors over 50 .			0
