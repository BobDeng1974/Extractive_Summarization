' they also made clear that her first solo foreign visit to @entity19 on behalf of the @entity20 next weekend was very much in jeopardy			1

@entity5 is believed to be around seven weeks pregnant with her second baby but has sadly been hit by the same severe vomiting condition that blighted her first			1
a source told @entity67 : ' if she continues to be as sick as she has been in recent days then all bets are off as regards her royal duties			1
' she is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum , which she experienced during the early stages of her first pregnancy			1
advice : @entity75 , who has known @entity7 for a number of years , has advised the couple to ' get more sleep ' before the birth of their second child the condition , which affects 3.5 per 1,000 pregnancies , causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration , weight loss and a build - up of toxins in the blood or urine , called ketosis			1
it is thought her illness began sometime last week and when @entity7 visited @entity96 on monday without his wife to open the institution ’s new @entity98 , he said the @entity0 had experienced a ' tricky few days '			1
@entity75 today offered his words of advice to @entity102 - get more sleep before their second baby arrives			1
as the father of four children , the former @entity107 footballer is speaking from experience and reacted to news of the royal pregnancy by praising the couple 's parenting skills			1
speaking during an interview with @entity118 ’s @entity117 show , @entity75 gave the couple some words of wisdom : ' get some sleep because jumping from one child to two is a big step even though i thought jumping from two to three was bigger			1
' the former @entity107 midfielder was interviewed at @entity128 fashion week where he is promoting his new collection for the brand @entity130			2
@entity75 has known @entity7 for a number of years having joined forces with him to promote @entity107 ’s bid to host the 2018 @entity135 , launched wildlife conservation campaigns with the @entity1 and been a guest at his wedding			2
the sportsman added : ' but i ’m so happy for them both because they ’re such great parents and obviously to be great parents and to have the roles that they have , as important as they have , is really incredible and i ’m just happy that they ’re going to have another little one running around the house			2
' the @entity146 greeted the news that he is to become a grandfather for a second time with joy and said he hoped the baby was a girl			2
yesterday , during a visit to the studio of a young entrepreneur who has been helped by his @entity155 said he would like a granddaughter			1
as he left the premises in @entity158 , @entity16 he met @entity159 who congratulated him on becoming a grandfather for the second time			2
the heir to the throne replied : ' i am already			2
but it ’s wonderful to be a grandfather again			2
i ’m looking forward to it - but i hope it will be a girl this time			2
' treatment : @entity5 leaves the @entity171 in december 2012 , where she was treated for hyperemesis gravidarum during her last pregnancy hyperemesis gravidarum is common , affecting around 15 per cent of all pregnancies			1
however in its extreme form - where a pregnant woman is admitted to hospital or suffers the condition throughout her pregnancy - it is much more rare			2
it is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers , and often develops around six weeks into the pregnancy , continuing until around 12 weeks			0
the condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘ pregnancy hormone ’ @entity190 , or human chorionic gonadotropin , which increases after conception			0
@entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 at @entity196 in @entity16 and @entity198 @entity197 , told @entity67 : ' the condition is extremely common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy			1
' it is associated with the changes in hormonal levels in the body , where the pregnancy hormones are quite high and it is the effect of those on the expectant mother			0
' if anything it is associated with a normal , healthy pregnancy			0
' the @entity1 indicated his wife may be over the worst of her morning sickness in a ' few weeks ' time ' when he appeared in @entity215 on monday , following the announcement of her pregnancy			0
@entity218 leads to severe dehydration and puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients			0
sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day , with exhausting and hazardous consequences			0
they can not eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week			0
this can trigger a build - up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food			0
hospital treatment for these women is essential , as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated			0
the condition can also affect the baby ’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight			0
in severe cases , the sickness can trigger a miscarriage			0
but it did not seem to be a problem for @entity258 – he was born a healthy 8lb 6oz , the heaviest future king in 100 years – and was several days overdue			0
in less severe cases the condition can be managed with supplementary hydration , medication and nurtrients			0
some women take vitamin b6 – which prevents sickness – as soon as they know they are pregnant			0
others may take stronger anti-nausea tablets such as cyclizine , which is also used to treat travel sickness and is said to be very effective			0
sufferers are advised to take plenty of fluids and try to have small snacks throughout the day as an empty stomach can trigger nausea			0
if they can not keep food down they will need anti-sickness medication and to be put on a drip			0
miss @entity193 said @entity5 is more susceptible to suffering hyperemesis gravidarum , having endured the acute sickness during her pregnancy with @entity258			1
she said : ' if you have suffered this condition before , it is more likely you will again			0

@entity0 , 32 , had been desperate to support prince @entity8 at the ceremony
doctors caring for her at @entity11 say she will not be well enough
@entity5 will also miss one of the competition 's athletics events tomorrow
her planned solo visit to @entity19 next weekend is also in jeopardy
