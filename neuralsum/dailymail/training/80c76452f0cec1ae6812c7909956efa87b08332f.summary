by @entity0 published : 04:03 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 12:30 est , 28 november 2013 @entity1 may be the best idea this year after @entity3 announced a raft of closures , reduced services and bus replacements over the festive period			1
routes to major airports look set to cause travel misery for those flying too , with @entity14 trains suspended from christmas day to @entity15 and some other overground services to the airport also affected			1
and it 's not just @entity20 passengers who may need to make alternative plans , mainline services to @entity23 and @entity24 airports will also be hit by closures - all caused by engineering work			1
cancellation notices such as this one are likely to be a common sight over the festive period repair work will also hit services operated by the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , @entity31 ( @entity31 ) and @entity33 train companies with some routes cancelled over the festive period , and bus replacement services being put in place			1
work between @entity40 station in @entity41 and @entity42 in @entity43 from december 27 to january 3 will cause problems for @entity31 passengers in the south east			2
@entity31 users will also have to put up with engineering work between @entity49 and @entity50 from december 27 to 29			2
during the same period , work between @entity52 and @entity53 will also hit services			1
bus replacement services are being offered by @entity31 between @entity56 and @entity57 from december 27 to 29 due to engineering work			1
@entity59 station in the capital , will be effected with services between there and @entity20 part closed and @entity31 services will also be disrupted from december 29 to january 3 by engineering work between @entity52 and @entity66			2
passengers who travel through @entity68 will see their services hit thanks to work on a major Â£ 19 million upgrade at the station in @entity73			1
planned engineering works throughout @entity75 over the @entity77 period : @entity31 : @entity40 and @entity42 , december 27 to january @entity78 and @entity79 , december 27 to @entity80 and @entity66 , december 27 to january @entity81 and @entity50 , december 27 to @entity82 and @entity57 , december 27 to 29 @entity83 : december 30 to january 1 @entity14 : trains suspended from christmas day to new years day @entity85 and @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , work see buses replace trains between @entity91 / @entity85 and @entity88 from 21 december to 5 january line closures between @entity93 and @entity94 , december 23 to @entity95 : @entity96 and @entity97 , december 28 to 30 @entity98 : @entity99 works between @entity100 and @entity101 , december 23 to 27 @entity103 part closure on @entity105 lines , december 23 to @entity107 station platforms 1 - 9 closed , december 27 - 29 @entity108 : upgrade to @entity68 station , station closed december 22 to january 5 it will mean the @entity108 company will not be able to run any trains from or through @entity68 between december 22 and january 5 so buses are being put in place			1
the @entity68 work will also affect @entity108 's high - speed services			2
work between @entity85 and @entity88 and between @entity87 and @entity88 will see buses replace trains between @entity91 / @entity85 and @entity88 from december 21 to january 5			0
in @entity24 there will be engineering work from december 23 to 27 there will be engineering work between @entity93 station and @entity94 with stations and lines closed at various times			0
engineering work in the @entity131 area will affect @entity133 services between december 27 and january 1			2
more repairs and upgrades from december 28 to 30 will mean @entity137 passengers will be offered buses in place of their usual trains between @entity96 and @entity97 in @entity141			0
and buses will replace trains on parts of the @entity99 between december 23 and 27 due to engineering work between @entity100 and @entity146			0
in the capital , platforms 1 - 9 will be closed at @entity149 from december 27 to 29 , with disruptions to services by @entity152			0
on the tube there is track replacement work at @entity103 in west @entity41 over the festive period			2
the @entity158 lines will have part closures between december 27 and 30 , while the @entity160 will be shut in places on december 28 and 29			0
another company to announce closures is @entity30 , who have said it would not have any services running between @entity20 and @entity166 from december 27 to january 1			1
passengers travelling between @entity20 and @entity59 or @entity168 will be asked to take a bus between @entity20 and @entity170 and a @entity33 service between @entity170 and @entity166			0
@entity108 will be running some high - speed services between @entity173 in @entity73 and @entity174 in @entity41 on @entity175			0
many will now be considering alternative transport plans with part closures adding time on to routes some workers who need to commute between @entity77 and @entity181 will be left with no choice but to travel trains will operate on a half - hourly basis from 8am to 8pm , with free car parking provided at @entity173 and @entity186 in north @entity73			1
@entity187 , director general of rail industry body the @entity189 , told the mirror : ' we are living through one of the biggest investment programmes in the history of the railway			0
' passengers and businesses are benefiting from multimillion - pound projects such as @entity199 and @entity200 as well as thousands of vital smaller schemes to improve tracks , signals and stations			0
' building a better network is something we do every day			0
but @entity77 and other major holidays are when the railway is less busy than on a typical weekday			1
so we use these periods to carry out particularly important improvements			0

*widespread* work means services to major airports will be affected
bus replacement services set to slow down @entity77 commuters
first @entity220 and @entity30 both hit by closures
