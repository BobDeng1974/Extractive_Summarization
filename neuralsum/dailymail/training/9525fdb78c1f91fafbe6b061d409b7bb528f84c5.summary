a new television series has shed light on the bizarre @entity3 trend for ' bagel heads '			0
the extraordinary look , which is created by injecting saline into the forehead , then pressing in the centre of the swollen area with a thumb , is a hit on the country 's underground body modification scene			1
the dramatic results of the two - hour treatment last just 16 - 24 hours , after which the saline is absorbed by the body and the forehead reduces back to its normal size			1
bagel heads : @entity25 ( left ) , @entity22 ( centre ) and @entity24 ( right ) pose after having saline injected into their foreheads to create the bizarre body modfication the process is revealed on @entity32 's @entity31 , where three people are seen undergoing the treatment in @entity35			1
it shows @entity25 , @entity22 and @entity24 having a large needle , attached to a saline drip , inserted into their foreheads			1
the practitioner administering the treatment , @entity42 , is heard saying : ' you really need to do it the right way , to reduce the risks			0
' the sensation is evidently uncomfortable			0
as it punctures the skin , @entity25 says : ' ooh ... that 's a needle going into my head ... ooh			1
' breakfast chic ? @entity22 poses with her new ' bagel head '			2
the effects are temporary and the saline will be absorbed by her body after 16 - 24 hours once fully inserted , the outline of the needle is clearly visible under the surface of the skin , and the saline slowly begins filling the forehead			2
at this point , @entity25 describes feeling ' a slight stinging sensation '			0
' it 's a relaxing sensation , kind of tingly , and also a building pressure that 's kind of slow and steady that kind of feels like it 's putting me to sleep ' he then reports a trickling feeling so intense , he is convinced that the liquid is falling down the outside of his face , asking the room : ' is there something dripping down my head ? ... i can really feel it in there , trickling down			2
' after an hour or so , the brave trio 's foreheads look significantly swollen , and they appear to have become accustomed to the needle in his head			2
' right now it 's kind of a relaxing sensation , kind of tingly , and also a kind of building pressure that 's kind of slow and steady that kind of feels like it 's putting me to sleep , ' @entity25 says			2
over the course of two hours , around 400cc of saline is transfused into each forehead			2
once it has reached the desired size , the practitioner removes the needle , and presses his thumb into the centre of the swelling			0
extreme procedure : @entity42 pinches @entity22 's forehead to insert the needle for her saline transfusion when the thumb on his forehead is removed @entity25 looks stunned , and the room breaks into a round of applause			1
' oh sweet buttery bagels - i 'm impressed ! ' he exclaims			0
' i look delicious ! ' ' oh sweet buttery bagels - i 'm impressed ! i look delicious ! ' the finished look is deemed ' cute ' by @entity22 , who sits beside him			0
once she and @entity24 , have also had their needles removed and thumbprint made , the trio admire their new looks with delight			0
the trend was initially sparked by the artist @entity127 , according to an interview in @entity129 last year			0
he told the magazine how he came across it in @entity131 , @entity132 , at the extreme body modification convention @entity134 in 1999			0
' i happened to meet @entity135 , who was the person who pioneered saline infusions , ' he explained			1
' we stayed in contact , then eventually i experienced saline with him in 2003 and he gave me permission to bring it to @entity3			0
waiting game : @entity25 , @entity22 and @entity24 must allow two hours for their foreheads to fill with saline ' i set up a team in @entity35 to administer infusions for other people			1
that â€™s been going since 2007			0
' he said fans of the procedure enjoy ' saline parties ' about twice a year , though some people will take their ' bagel head ' to clubs and fetish parties			1
the saline injections can be done on any part of the body - some people have even had ' scrotal infusions ' , he revealed - but for the most part , it is just the forehead			1
on its ( thankfully ) short - term effects , @entity127 joked : ' we enjoy being freaks for the night ! ' taboo airs sundays at 10pm et / @entity170 on the @entity32 and will premiere in the @entity171 in january 2013 .			1
