a property in @entity1 's inner - west with rotting floors , crumbling ceilings , and packed full of garbage sold for $ 923,000 over the weekend			1
the uninhabitable dump on @entity6 , @entity7 , went under the hammer on saturday , and had bids from 20 serious buyers			2
the bidding started at $ 600,000 but quickly climbed , before selling for $ 923,000 , which was 15 to 20 percent higher than the expected price , according to selling agent @entity14			1
it is littered with broken - down appliances , old clothing , and furniture , and this is after mr @entity14 removed nine truckloads of rubbish from the property			2
' it 's very run - down , very basic … but it 's got a hell of a lot of potential , ' he told @entity58 last week			0
but mr @entity14 said the dilapidated condition of the property ' put people on ' rather than putting them off the purchase			0
' they like the basics , just the demand is a lot stronger for the basic dumpster , rather than the reno - ed you - beaut [ house ] , ' he told @entity58			0
he said that buyers want to be able to ' do it your own way rather than undo someone else ’s taste			0
' evidence of this , he said , was the fact that 32 @entity17 , @entity7 , a fully - renovated three - bedroom home in great condition , sold for $ 980,000 on friday , less than $ 60,000 more than the ' dumpster ' down the road			1
the house is a deceased estate that has not been on the market since it was first built in the 1930s the property is extremely neglected and it would be a huge job to renovate the house is in a very derelict state , but is in an excellent location the house was sold to a builder , though there was some interest in the property from ' brave hearts ' - young couples who are keen for a renovation challenge the house is in one of the best locations in the @entity1 suburb of @entity7 before auction , the property had already attracted offers in the late $ 700,000s due largely to the location of the property			1
' the location is outstanding , it 's in one of the best parts of @entity7 , ' said mr @entity14			2
' the home has very strong bones			0
' the house was purchased by a builder , and ninety percent of interest in the sale came from builders and professional renovators , along with the odd ' brave hearts ' – young couples who want to take on a serious fixer - upper			2
the @entity6 home sold for 15 percent higher than the expected price this list still taped to the wall gives an insight into how the home was once looked after the backyard is in an extremely unkempt state , and nine truckloads of rubbish have already been removed from the property mr @entity14 estimated that if someone ' fixed up all the warts ' of the house – putting in a new kitchen , new ceilings and polished floors – they could sell it for $ 1.2 million			1
it could go for even more if builders extended the property			0
the deceased estate dates back to the 1930s and it has not been on the market since it was built			0
