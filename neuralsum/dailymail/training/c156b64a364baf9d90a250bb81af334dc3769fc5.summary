by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 18 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:37 est , 18 november 2013 a girl of six has helped evict an ' unbearably ' noisy neighbour after drawing a crayon picture of their adjoining homes with the caption : ' new house gangs and loud music			1
' the ' heart - breaking ' drawing , which the girl had done for a school project about her life , was presented as evidence at an eviction hearing which resulted in the troublesome family being moved from the semi-detached house in @entity19 , @entity20			1
the primary school pupil drew the picture of barmaid @entity24 's house as part of a series of pictures of events in her life - others featured herself as a baby , her pet dog , and her mother 's new car			1
' gangs and loud music ' : the child 's drawing that was used as evidence in the fight to have @entity24 evicted @entity42 said @entity24 , who lived in the house on the right , held all - night parties that often ended in fighting the child 's teacher asked her about the drawing of new home and the house next door with a red scribble through it , and was shocked when the girl told her about large groups of people gathering at the house and rowdy behaviour			1
the teacher was so concerned she brought it up with her mother at a parent - teacher evening			2
that sparked an 11 - month campaign to get @entity24 , 45 , and her two sons kicked out of her rented semi-detached in @entity19 , @entity20			1
today residents in the street spoke of their relief after @entity24 and her two sons were ordered to leave the property after the child 's drawing was used in evidence			1
@entity74 , 37 , who moved into the street in may 2011 , said the family 's behaviour made life ' unbearable ' for her family			2
she said : ' we moved in on the thursday and that saturday there was music and loud banging until 5am			0
noisy : @entity24 , right , has been evicted after a hearing in which a child 's drawing was used as evidence ' they used to cut through gardens , urinate in our gardens , shout abuse up at the house and at my kids , jump on our cars , it was horrendous			1
' my children were having to sleep in earmuffs and i think it 's important to stand up to people like that			2
' @entity24 who is thought to have moved into the property in 2006 , held a string of wild parties despite repeated warnings by her landlords about her unruly household			1
neighbours were kept awake by all - night parties , which often ended with fighting in the street			2
children living near the property had to stack pillows against the walls to muffle the noise , and wear earmuffs so they could sleep			0
another neighbour who asked not to be named said : ' living near them was an absolute nightmare			0
i lived on the street since 1985 but i think they must have moved in about 10 years ago			0
' they were okay at first but soon after there was just trouble			0
they would have all sorts of fancy cars parked up outside at all hours and there were all sorts going in and out of the house			0
' the area has gone downhill because of that family			0
they are very cocky and the general ambiance with them there was horrible			0
' ' heart - breaking ' : the child drew her noisy neighbours alongside pictures of her as a baby and her pet dog @entity24 was first taken to court by officers from @entity147 in december 2012 and was served an injunction demanding she stop the noise			1
when it continued , officers started legal proceedings for an eviction			0
in august this year , @entity24 was handed a suspended possession order , which meant that she could be evicted if the nuisance continued			2
but the order was breached within a month , so officers went back to court to apply for a warrant to evict her			0
the warrant to kick her out of the house was issued at @entity162 last wednesday			0
@entity164 's @entity163 said : ' our quick - thinking officers were able to take legal action by using this heart - breaking drawing as evidence and we are delighted that the courts were able to act to rid this neighbourhood of such a selfish and anti-social character			1
