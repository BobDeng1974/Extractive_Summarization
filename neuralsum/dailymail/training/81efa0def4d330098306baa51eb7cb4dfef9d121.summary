the @entity44 almost blew their chance to win saturday 's final after @entity15 took a surprise 2 - 0 lead with just eight minutes of the game gone			2
but @entity51 's side bounced back through a @entity53 free - kick before @entity54 equalised after 71 minutes			0

' i have nothing against this question if you say that in the other clubs as well , there are some clubs who have n't won for 20 years and they do n't get this question at all			2
