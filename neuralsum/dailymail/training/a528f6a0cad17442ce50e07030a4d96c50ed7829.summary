everyone loves a good prank			0
that is , everyone but the one being pranked -- or the ' prankee			0
' the latest prank video posted by @entity7 was no different			2
in the video ' peeking into @entity10 ! ' a girl uses a creepy - looking , male mannequin head ( with a curly wig on it ) to scare women in a bathroom stall			1
the women in the neighboring stall would unsuspectingly use the bathroom , and the prankster would slide the mannequin head over or under the stall			1
at the end of the video , the prankster slipped the mannequin head into the neighboring stall once more			2
but this time , the prankee grabs the wig off the mannequin head and throws it across the stall			0
when the prankster informs the woman that it 's all a joke , the woman angrily yells ' f * ck your joke ! ' for more videos , please go to @entity69 wig : one scared woman pulled the wig off of the mannequin head before yelling ' f * ck your joke ! ' most women in the prank proved to be good sports , but @entity79 also posted a video of the prank being performed in a men 's bathroom -- the men were n't so forgiving			1
in the men 's prank video , the men never laughed , only yelled profanities and threatened the prankster			1
one man even approached the prankster with a gun , threatening him , asking ' is it funny now ? '			0

@entity7 posted a hilarious prank video using a creepy - looking , male mannequin head to scare women in a bathroom stall
most of the women delivered blood - curdling screams before *realizing* it is only a prank
one woman was so *afraid* that she *attacked* the mannequin head
in the male *version* of the prank video , the men were not so forgiving ; they yelled profanities and threatened the prankster .
