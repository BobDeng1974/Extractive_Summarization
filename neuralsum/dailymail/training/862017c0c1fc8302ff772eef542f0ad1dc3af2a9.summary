by @entity0 published : 11:47 est , 28 april 2013 updated : 11:55 est , 28 april 2013 built to dominate the enemy in combat , the @entity3 's hulking @entity2 tank is proving equally hard to beat in a budget battle			1
lawmakers from both parties have devoted nearly half a billion dollars in taxpayer money over the past two years to build improved versions of the 70 - ton @entity2			1
but senior @entity3 officials have said repeatedly , ' no thanks			2
' it 's the inverse of the federal budget world these days , in which automatic spending cuts are leaving sought - after pet programs struggling or unpaid altogether			0
tanked : lawmakers from both parties have devoted nearly half a billion dollars in taxpayer funds to build improved versions of the 70 - ton @entity2 tank , which the @entity3 does n't want republicans and @entity23 for years have fought so bitterly that lawmaking in @entity25 ground to a near - halt			1
yet in the case of the @entity2 tank , there 's a bipartisan push to spend an extra $ 436 million on a weapon the experts explicitly say is not needed			1
' if we had our choice , we would use that money in a different way , ' gen. @entity32 , the @entity3 's chief of staff , told @entity0 this past week			1
why are the tank dollars still flowing ? politics			2
general : the @entity3 's chief of staff , gen @entity32 , says ' if we had our choice , we would use that money in a different way ' keeping the @entity2 production line rolling protects businesses and good paying jobs in congressional districts where the tank 's many suppliers are located			1
if there 's a home of the @entity2 , it 's politically important @entity51			2
the nation 's only tank plant is in @entity54			2
so it 's no coincidence that the champions for more tanks are rep @entity59 and @entity62 @entity61 , two of @entity66 's @entity65 most prominent deficit hawks , as well as @entity62 @entity67			2
they said their support is rooted in protecting national security , not in pork - barrel politics			0
' the one area where we are supposed to spend taxpayer money is in defense of the country , ' said @entity59 , whose district in the northwest part of the state includes the tank plant			1
the @entity2 dilemma underscores the challenge that defense secretary @entity83 faces as he seeks to purge programs that the military considers unnecessary or too expensive in order to ensure there 's enough money for essential operations , training and equipment			1
@entity92 , a former @entity93 senator from @entity94 , faces a daunting task in persuading members of @entity97 to eliminate or scale back projects favored by constituents			0
federal budgets are always peppered with money for pet projects			0
what sets the @entity2 example apart is the certainty of the @entity3 's position			1
@entity107 , director of research for the nonpartisan @entity109 , said @entity97 should listen when one of the military services says no to more equipment			0
' when an institution as risk averse as the @entity116 says they have enough tanks , we can probably believe them , ' @entity107 said			0
congressional backers of the @entity2 upgrades view the vast network of companies , many of them small businesses , that manufacture the tanks ' materials and parts as a critical asset that has to be preserved			1
the money , they say , is a modest investment that will keep important tooling and manufacturing skills from being lost if the @entity2 line were to be shut down			1
uphill battle : the @entity2 dilemma underscores the challenge that defense secretary @entity83 faces as he seeks to purge programs that the military considers unnecessary or too expensive the @entity54 plant is a study in how federal dollars affect local communities , which in turn hold tight to the federal dollars			1
the facility is owned by the federal government but operated by the land systems division of @entity146 , a major defense contractor that spent close to $ 11million last year on lobbying , according to the nonpartisan @entity148			2
the plant is @entity54 's fifth - largest employer with close to 700 employees , down from about 1,100 just a few years ago , according to mayor @entity152			0
but the facility is still crucial to the local economy			0
' all of those jobs and their spending activity in the community and the company 's spending probably have about a $ 100million impact annually , ' @entity155 said			0
@entity59 , a @entity162 conservative leader who has pushed for deep reductions in federal spending , supported the automatic cuts known as the sequester that require $ 42billion to be shaved from the @entity116 's budget by the end of september			0
the military also has to absorb a $ 487billion reduction in defense spending over the next 10 years , as required by the @entity172 passed in 2011			2
still , said @entity59 , it would be a big mistake to stop producing tanks			0
production : the @entity177 is @entity54 's fifth - largest employer with close to 700 employees , down from about 1,100 just a few years ago , according to @entity54 's mayor ' look , ( the plant ) is in the 4th @entity182 and my job is to represent the 4th @entity182 , so i understand that , ' he said			0
' but the fact remains , if it was not in the best interests of the national defense for the @entity189 , then you would not see me supporting it like we do			0
' the tanks that @entity97 is requiring the @entity3 to buy are n't brand new			1
earlier models are being outfitted with a sophisticated suite of electronics that gives the vehicles better microprocessors , color flat panel displays , a more capable communications system , and other improvements			0
the upgraded tanks cost about $ 7.5million each , according to the @entity3			1
out of a fleet of nearly 2,400 tanks , roughly two - thirds are the improved versions , which the @entity3 refers to with a moniker that befits their heft : the @entity208 , and service officials said they have plenty of them			1
' the @entity3 is on record saying we do not require any additional @entity217 , ' @entity213 , deputy director of the @entity3 budget office , said this month			2
the tank fleet , on average , is less than 3 years old			2
the @entity2 is named after gen @entity2 , one of the top tank commanders during @entity220 and a former @entity3 chief of staff			1
new tech : the upgraded tanks cost about $ 7.5million each , according to the @entity3 the @entity3 's plan was to stop buying tanks until 2017 , when production of a newly designed @entity2 would begin			1
orders for @entity2 tanks from @entity189 allies help fill the gap created by the loss of tanks for the @entity3 , according to service officials , but congressional proponents of the program feared there would not be enough international business to keep the @entity2 line going			1
this pause in tank production for the @entity189 would allow the @entity3 to spend its money on research and development work for the new and improved model , said @entity243 , a spokeswoman for the @entity3 's @entity245 office			1
the first editions of the @entity2 tank were fielded in the early 1980s			1
over the decades , the @entity2 supply chain has become embedded in communities across the country			2
@entity146 estimated in 2011 that there were more than 560 subcontractors throughout the country involved in the @entity2 program and that they employed as many as 18,000 people			2
more than 40 of the companies are in @entity257 , according to sen. @entity258 , @entity257 , also a staunch backer of continued tank production			0
like new : the @entity2 tank fleet , on average , is less than 3 years old			1
it is named for gen @entity2 , one of the top tank commanders during @entity220 and a former @entity3 chief of staff a letter signed by 173 @entity23 and @entity93 members of the @entity162 last year and sent to then - defense secretary @entity267 demonstrated the depth of bipartisan support for the @entity270 on @entity271			1
they chided the @entity274 administration for neglecting the industrial base and proposing to terminate tank production in the @entity189 for the first time since @entity220 @entity61 , who served as president @entity279 's budget director before being elected to the @entity280 , said allowing the line to wither and close would create a financial mess			0
' people ca n't sit around for three years on unemployment insurance and wait for the government to come back , ' @entity61 said			0
' that supply chain is going to be much more costly and much more inefficient to create if you mothball the plant			0
' @entity289 , a @entity146 spokesman , said the money from @entity97 is allowing for a stable base of production for the @entity3 , which receives about four tanks a month			1
facing backlash : lawmakers have chided the @entity274 administration for neglecting the industrial base and proposing to terminate tank production in the @entity189 for the first time since @entity220 with the line open , @entity54 also can fill international orders , bringing more work to @entity54 and preserving @entity189 jobs , he said			2
current foreign customers are @entity305 , which is getting about five tanks a month , and @entity307 , which is getting four			0
each country pays all of their own costs			0
that 's a ' success story during a period of economic pain , ' @entity289 said			0
still , far fewer tanks are coming out of the @entity54 plant than in years past			1
the drop - off has affected companies such as @entity317 in @entity318 , @entity51 , which makes seats and other parts for the @entity2			2
production : the first editions of the @entity2 tank were fielded in the early 1980s			1
over the decades , the @entity2 supply chain has become embedded in communities across the country @entity327 , the company 's president , said his sales have dropped from $ 20 million to $ 7 million over the past two years			1
he 's also had to lay off about 25 skilled employees and he expects to be issuing more pink slips in the future			0
' when we start to lose this base of people , what are we going to do ? buy our tanks from @entity338 ? ' @entity327 said			0
@entity339 , a defense expert at the @entity340 in @entity25 , said the difficulty of reviving defense industrial capabilities tends to be overstated			0
' from the fairly insular world in which the defense industry operates , these capabilities seem to be unique and in many cases extraordinarily high art , ' said @entity339 , a former deputy undersecretary of defense for industrial affairs and installations during the @entity350 administration			0
' but in the greater scope of the economy , they tend not to be			0

lawmakers have devoted nearly half a billion dollars in taxpayer funds over the past two years to roll out upgrades of the @entity2 tank
