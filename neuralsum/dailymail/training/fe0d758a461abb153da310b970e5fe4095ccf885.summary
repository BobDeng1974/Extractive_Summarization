@entity1 ’s poster boy was his all - action self against @entity3 in @entity5 ’s @entity4 but the opposition ’s dirty tactics minimised his impact as @entity1 struggled to battle their way past their stubborn fellow group leaders			1
@entity11 could n't help but show his emotions as his nation 's national anthem played - @entity1 's star man burst into tears as the players lined - up before the match and had to wipe his eyes ahead of kick - off			1
the brilliant number 10 failed to add to his 33 goals in 50 games but time and again almost inspired the @entity1 to a narrow victory , only to be foiled one way or another by @entity27			1
the newly blond forward also had a volley well saved and looked the most likely to break the deadlock for either side , despite being tripled - marked at times			0
his 26th minute header was destined for the corner of the @entity3 net before @entity27 brilliantly scooped it out in one of the best tests of @entity54 ’s new goalline technology			2
that moment summed up the 22 - year - old ’s evening as he showed his undoubted skill but was often thwarted by enthusiastic opponents both within and out of the laws of the game			0
video @entity27 brilliance denies @entity1 come on ! @entity11 bids to lift the crowd at the @entity63 as @entity1 tried to break the deadlock close control : @entity11 holds off the challenge of @entity3 midfielder @entity67 man in the middle : @entity11 races forward with the ball but is surrounded by three @entity3 players in truth , @entity11 is perhaps fortunate to have come out of the game unscathed given the tenacity of the challenges flying in at his ankles			1
but the lack of a goal to boost him in the @entity81 stakes will have disappointed many punters as well as the @entity84 public			0
ultimately , @entity3 showed that teams can stop @entity11 – it just takes some astute goalkeeping and some risky challenges			2
@entity88 might not be so lucky in @entity1 ’s final group game			0
tricky : @entity11 pulls @entity3 defender @entity90 one way and then the other during the @entity93 clash grounded : @entity11 falls to the floor under the challenge of @entity3 defender @entity96 sitting it out : @entity11 lands on @entity3 midfielder @entity98 following another tackle			0

@entity11 's impact was minimised by @entity3 's dirty tactics at the @entity4
@entity1 star burst in tears during his nation 's national anthem
@entity110 *frontman* went close but was denied by the *heroics* of @entity3 goalkeeper @entity27
