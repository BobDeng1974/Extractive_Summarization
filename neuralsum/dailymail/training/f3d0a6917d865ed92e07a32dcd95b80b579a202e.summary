@entity0 would like to continue working with @entity1 — who was sacked as @entity4 batting coach earlier this year — after a one - to - one session before last week ’s third test proved an instant hit			1
the @entity4 no 4 made a sparkling 167 in @entity8 , his first test hundred for 20 innings , to set up a crushing win over @entity12 — and credited his revival to a two - hour net with @entity1 at @entity15			1
@entity0 had been one of the senior players failing to do justice to their talents this summer , averaging just 25 in four games against @entity20 and the @entity21			1
but , two days after the nadir of @entity4 ’s 95 - run defeat in the second test at @entity25 , he invited @entity1 up to @entity26 for a session on @entity29 ’s colts ground			1
@entity30 : @entity0 celebrates his first test hundred for 20 innings at the @entity33 credit : @entity1 ( right ) is still held in high esteem by @entity4 's batsmen and helped @entity0 find his form not cutting the mustard : @entity0 was out at @entity39 when caught in two minds @entity41 praises @entity4 ‘ we have a really good set - up with @entity4 , but sometimes it ’s nice to have another set of eyes , ’ @entity0 told @entity42			1
‘ i used to have @entity48 here at @entity29 , someone you could chat through a few things with			2
because they ’re not so attached to the game , there ’s less emotion involved , and it ’s nice to do that with @entity58 — a net session with someone who can help me reconnect in a different way			2
’ @entity1 , whose tally of 20 test hundreds was surpassed by @entity0 at the @entity33 , was hurt when @entity64 told him at the end of april that his services were no longer required by @entity4			1
but @entity0 ’s decision to seek help outside the bubble reflects the high esteem in which @entity1 continues to be held			1
‘ he does one - on - one net sessions really well , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he never goes through the motions			2
he puts you under the pump , which is where you are in a test match			2
he never gets over-complicated or technical			0
it ’s about making sure you ’re in the right frame of mind			0
‘ as @entity58 always says , you should always be looking to score runs , not just to survive			0
it ’s nice to refresh that from time to time			0
generally we ’re always exchanging text messages			0
‘ and if he ’s available i try to make the most of him for a couple of hours			0
if i get the chance i ’d like to keep doing that			0
’ reversal of fortune : a confident @entity0 reverse sweeps @entity92 at @entity8 going over the top : @entity0 was confident enough to play some shots in the second innings at the @entity33 @entity0 moved into @entity4 ’s top ten test run scorers against @entity12 last week			1
his 7091 took him past @entity97			0
@entity1 was not @entity0 ’s only net buddy in the lead - up to the @entity100			1
after seeking permission from @entity64 and coach @entity102 , @entity0 took it upon himself to offer his former @entity29 team - mate @entity104 help with his off - breaks			1
the upshot ? second - innings figures of six for 67 , the best by an @entity4 spinner against @entity12 since @entity110 at @entity25 in 1967			1
@entity0 said : ‘ having watched him bowl in the first test , and having faced him in the nets , it felt like he was bowling in the @entity114 as he was in the nets			1
‘ the important thing for me was trying to get him clear on what his role was at different times in the game			0
‘ @entity124 was brilliant at having two game plans : hold up an end for the seamers when conditions are n’t in your favour , then bowl aggressively when they are			0
@entity104 is naturally aggressive : he gets spin on the ball and good shape			1
highs and lows : @entity0 jumps for joy after scoring an @entity138 ton last summer but struggled @entity139 ( right ) ‘ he ’s got his pace up a little bit to 55mph , from 51 when he started			2
but on the @entity143 data he ’s also getting more drop and drift			0
‘ the important thing for me is not pace but energy			0
when @entity124 bowled , his arm speed was full of energy , so the ball drops			0
with dismissals like when @entity104 nicked off @entity153 and @entity154 — world - class players of spin — the ball deceived them on length			1
he wants to learn and he ’s not far away			0
’ @entity4 ’s unofficial vice-captain , @entity0 was named in some quarters as a possible leader until @entity64 ended his own drought last week with scores of 95 and 70 not out and his side ’s first win in @entity166			1
but he says it was not a scenario he gave any credence to			0
‘ i heard it muttered around , but i did n’t pay it much attention because obviously i believe @entity173 ’s the right man			0
he ’s won @entity114 series in @entity12 , he ’s won an @entity138 series and he ’s 29			0
i think he ’s the right bloke to captain @entity4			2
’ vintage : @entity0 is an ambassador for @entity178 if the loyalty is to be expected , then @entity0 ’s own lack of runs made his potential promotion just as unlikely			1
but his 167 — after he was lucky to escape an lbw shout from @entity184 before he had scored — symbolised the about - turn in @entity8 which @entity0 describes as ‘ a perfect five days ’			1
and he said the possible ban hanging over @entity187 during the third test following his altercation in the @entity39 pavilion with @entity92 did @entity4 no harm			1
‘ maybe it has brought us tighter together , ’ he said			2
‘ no one ’s really discussed it too much			0
@entity187 wanted it that way , to focus on the cricket			2
but hopefully it will keep us tight as a unit			0
@entity187 was at the top of his game — he must prefer those headlines			2
’ when the fourth test starts in @entity202 on thursday , @entity4 will be hoping for more of the same			1
@entity0 was attending a net session for @entity205 winners			2
