this is the incredible moment a cheeky shark photobombed a diver and even seemed to grin for the camera as it barged its way in to the shot			2
photographer @entity7 , 52 , was left stunned by the close encounter while diving in the @entity11 sea off the @entity13 coast			1
the underwater snapper , from @entity15 , @entity16 , was attempting to take a picture of a fellow diver and tiger shark when the ten foot lemon shark swam into the frame			1
coming through : a lemon shark takes diver @entity23 by surprise , bursting in to shot as @entity7 tries to take pictures of another shark			1
it appears to be grinning as it heads straight for the camera in this image taken in the @entity32 off the @entity13 in january he said : ' i was actually photographing the diver who was pointing at a rather large tiger shark , that 's why the diver is still in focus and the shark is n't			1
' but all of a sudden this lemon shark swam into the frame and photobombed the picture			1
' it looked like it was smiling and it almost looked like it was saying ' hey take a picture of me '			2
' lemon sharks are really curious and this one was definitely checking me out			0
' the images were taken during a one - week expedition in the @entity13 in january this year , but these particular images were taken on just one dive			2
flashing a grin : this lemon shark arrived out of the blue as @entity7 was trying to take a picture of diver @entity59 ' i remember this dive being very chaotic it was a really dynamic shoot with dozens of sharks			1
' @entity7 said he took up photography in 2006 shortly after he began scuba diving			2
he said of all the dives he had photographed this particular trip was one of his most successful			0
' for me photography and diving went hand in hand , i wanted to share my experience so i began taking photos to document what i saw , ' he said			0
' i 'd been close to sharks before but during this most recent dive i managed to get closer than i 'd ever been before , i encountered lemon , tiger , @entity11 reef and nurse sharks			2

for me this experience confirmed that for me			0
as diver @entity85 watches on , the lemon shark heads straight for the camera being held by @entity16 photographer @entity7			1
it swam into shot while mr @entity7 , from @entity16 , was trying to take pictures of a tiger shark in the @entity13 after photobombing the picture , the lemon shark swims on to its side while diver @entity59 rests his hands on its head ' you do have to be careful sharks do n't see you as a threat			1
you have to make sure you cover up , just a flash of skin could be mistaken for a fish and they may grab your hand thinking it 's prey			0
' by the time the shark would realise it was n't a fish , it would be too late			0
' if a shark bit down hard just once it would most probably be fatal			0
' but i was underwater for up to six hours every day for a week with these sharks and not once did they even attempt to bite me			0
' it 's feels incredibly humbling to get this close to sharks and so rare it would be the equivalent of a grizzly bear walking up to you , it 's awe - inspiring			0
' the lemon shark turns around for another shot as schools of yellow fish swim past			1
diver @entity59 , pictured , films the experience along with a colleague a diver gently touches the lemon shark 's chin lower jaw after the creature had arrived unannounced and photobombed a picture session in the @entity13			1
