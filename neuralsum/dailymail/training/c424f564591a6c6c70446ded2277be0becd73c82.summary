as she cuts open deep red radishes to reveal the pink rings inside , you might think @entity4 is creating an elaborate salad			1
but while she tears up lambs lettuce and arranges waxy - skinned chillies , she is actually creating an exquisite piece of art. artist , vegan cook and blogger ms @entity4 has made a series of designs in which she lays real fruit and vegetables on a sheet and photographs them from above			1
she says the idea for ' veg art ' blossomed from her own passion for a fruit and vegetable - based diet and living a healthy lifestyle			1
eighteen months ago she decided to follow a vegan diet , which was not for ethical or health reasons but simply because it makes her feel ' fantastic '			1
she accidentally dropped some vegetables she was carrying home onto her flagstone doorstep , and some autumn leaves blew into them			1
it looked so beautiful , she decided to start creating other pieces of art , deconstructing salads and placing the produce into intricate patterns in order to create gorgeous designs			1
' i love the beauty of natural foods ; their different colours , shapes , textures and characters , ' she told @entity47			1
' so to me , fruit and veg are not only really good for you nutritionally they also have a wonderful aesthetic appeal too			1
' it ’s a joy to use beautiful ingredients and my work aims to showcase their unique qualities , reflect the changing seasons of the year and also be a celebration of healthy living			1
' ' i love how each ingredient has its own little back story and how sometimes a seemingly random collection of things can inexplicably make a harmonious whole			1
' this is a rose petal strewn design , with ingredients for a middle - eastern inspired salad			2
@entity4 said : ' i was making a salad with a slightly more unusual dressing			1
i used candy beetroots , cut finely so you could see the beautiful rings inside			1
then i used chilli , ginger and some yellow beetroot which my mother had grown for me in her garden			2
as well as lettuce in the salad , i tossed through rose petals afterwards for a romantic feel ' ' a textile - type design using a selection of fruit and veg i had to hand			1
it features watermelon radish from my parents			2
they pulled them out of the garden which is why you can see the roots			2
then i used the last of the yellow courgettes from my greenhouse , long green peppers and pomegranates , purple heirloom carrots ( a gift from my mother ’s kind friend ) and some forgotten figs i found in the fridge ' this design features yellow courgettes , fig leaves and radicchio flowers			2
' i loved the yellows , greens and blues			2
my radicchio plant looks so beautiful when it goes to seed			1
the sun came out and cast a shadow across everything - i just love the quality of natural light			2

i love the design because it looked spring like and cheered me up , ' @entity4 said this @entity182 style design features purple and white kale , pomegranate , papaya , oranges , strawberries , cucumber , passion fruit and cherries			1
later , @entity4 whizzed it up into a smoothie			1
the design was a result of a trip to a @entity182 stall at her local market			0
' i found some beautiful vivid kale , as bright as the picture , ' she said			2
' it was the colour of dark lavender			0
then some white kale , with a green ruffle			0
for the design i just came back from the market with all these bright fruits and flunked down on the floor			2
the gorgeous smell of passion fruit filled the room ' an autumn fruit salad with red apple ' spaghetti ' , pale pink pomegranates , turkish figs , black dessert grapes and an orange and passion fruit dressing			2
@entity4 said : ' the black grapes were from my little vine			1
they are very sweet and i scattered them at the end and the sunlight just caught them ' pictured are candy cane beets , purple radishes , and pink flamingo swiss chard , photographed with a soft , vintage - style filter			0
