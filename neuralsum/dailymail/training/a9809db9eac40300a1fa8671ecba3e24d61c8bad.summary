tourists are being urged not to leave padlocks on a @entity3 bridge to symbolise their love - and to take selfies instead			1
officials in the @entity8 capital are cracking down on the gesture , which sees couples leave a ' love lock ' on the @entity12 , and are advising couples to take photos to post on social media			1
the practice of attaching the inscribed padlocks has become so popular that part of the bridge over the @entity20 collapsed under their weight in june			1
a city official told @entity47 newspaper : ' there was no question of a clampdown or penalising tourists who place padlocks , so we 're proposing that they use a " social wall " instead			1
' tourists have been evacuated from one of the most iconic bridges in @entity3 after it began to crumble under the weight of thousands of ' love locks '			1
a chunk of the @entity12 bridge fell away in june and the police were called to seal off the area which remained closed for days			2
it is a popular custom for tourists to secure a padlock to the bridge branded with their names as a romantic gesture , with @entity28 and boyfriend @entity29 also indulging in the tradition			1
celebrity trend : @entity28 , pictured with @entity29 and son @entity32 , was captured on camera attaching the lock for tv show keeping up with the @entity76 in the family : @entity78 and her mother @entity80 also stopped at @entity12 on a visit to @entity3 to attach a padlock to the bridge vying for space : there are now so many padlocks on the bridge that some tourists have taken to attaching theirs to lampposts too @entity78 has also been pictured attaching a lock to the bridge when she visited @entity3 while pregnant			1
but the weight of the locks is damaging the metal @entity94 , which was originally completed in 1804 but rebuilt in the 1980s following damage in the two @entity97			0
a local @entity8 police spokesperson said of the collapse in june : ' a metal grille had fallen inwards , rather than into the river			0
' if it had landed on a passing boat , the results could have been disastrous			0
as it happened , nobody was injured			0
' the bridge was evacuated , and will now be closed until monday morning at the earliest			0
' it follows growing calls for the padlocks - which also blight other major @entity113 cities including @entity114 - to be banned			2
the famous @entity3 bridge is said to offer some of the best views along the @entity20 it was first built between 1802 and 1804 , under the reign of @entity119 , and is a favourite with artists due to damage sustained in @entity124 and @entity125 , the bridge was rebuilt between 1981 and 1984 the ' love lock ' tradition began in @entity128 in the early 20th century , based on a tale of a woman who lost her soldier love to another during @entity124			1
young women started symbolising their love by attaching padlocks to the bridge where the abandoned woman used to meet her lost lover			1
the padlock tradition took hold in @entity141 in the early 2000s and was popularised by an @entity143 book i want you by @entity146 , in which a couple adds a padlock to the @entity150 in @entity151			0
in @entity3 , the ritual began in 2008 on the @entity12 but has since extended to the @entity153 near @entity154 too			2
othe bridges encountering problems from a vast quantity of padlocks being affixed are the @entity159 in @entity160 and the @entity161 in @entity162			0
it has become common practice for visitors to buy a padlock , attach it to a bridge , and then throw the key into the river , in @entity3 's case the @entity20			1
the practice has been encouraged by @entity173 celebrities including @entity78 and @entity174 , who spent a lot of time dating in @entity3 before their wedding in @entity143 last month			2
the ' @entity179 ' campaign was launched in @entity3 by two @entity173 in february , in response to some 700,000 padlocks appearing around the city			2
all bridges have been blighted by the practice , but the @entity12 now looks like two solid walls of metal divided by a wooden walkway			0
' it 's so out of control , ' says @entity189 , who co-founded the campaign with fellow writer @entity191			0
love locks : @entity78 and @entity174 also attached a padlock to the bridge when they were in @entity3 lookout point : the bridge is famed for its spectacular views along the @entity20 ' people are climbing up lampposts to clip locks on , hanging over the bridge to put them on the other side of the rail , risking their lives to attach one			1
it 's a kind of mania			0
it 's not about romance any more - it 's just about saying ' i did it			0
' the original was damaged by @entity215 bombs during both world wars , but a faithful reproduction was built during the 1980s			0
it was once considered a hugely romantic bridge , enjoying arguably the prettiest views in the city , but many locals argue the padlocks have turned it into a tourist trap .			2
