an artist created a series of sculptures that were so small they could be stood on the head of an ant , balanced on a human hair or placed in the eye of a needle			1
@entity9 made the extraordinary figures , called nano sculptures , using groundbreaking 3d printing technology			1
the largest of his series of seven sculptures was about the width of a strand of human hair - the smallest is less than half that width			1
after 10 months of designing , sculpting and rendering , he was finally able to see his figures using an incredibly powerful microscope that is used to examine cancer cells			1
but after just a few fleeting moments , his creations were destroyed - smudged by a colleague 's finger			0
the 10 - month project started with taking scans of his muse as she stood naked in different poses that recalled @entity52 's neoclassical sculpture			2
he shares his journey to creating ' the smallest creation of the human form ' on his website			0
she was positioned in the centre of roughly 250 cameras that had been assembled in a dome - ready to take simultaneous images of her body from every angle			0
a high - powered computer programme was used to take all of the data that was captured on camera and reassemble it into images - into something that mr @entity9 calls ' digital clay '			0
the sculptures were printed — with advice from the @entity90 , using a complex 3d printing technique , with another technique used to achieve the fine detail work			0
tender : the figures were based on @entity51 , an 18th century sculpture by @entity52 that features the god @entity97 minuscule : the entwined figures , seen on the head of an ant , could only be seen using a microscope that is used to study cancer cells intricate : @entity9 could not see the sculptures when they arrived - placed on a mirror in a jewellery box packed in layers of bubble wrap all seven of them were so small that when they arrived - on a tiny piece of mirror , in a jewellery box , wrapped in layers of boxes and bubble wrap - he could n't see anything			1
eventually saw what looked like seven minuscule dust particles that were caught in the light			0
after a hunt to find a microscope that was strong enough to pick up the detail of the figures - only one used to study cancer cells was strong enough - and 45 minutes searching the mirror , mr @entity9 was finally able to see his sculptures			1
he said : ' everything just stops and everyone goes silent , and we stare at this , this feat of humanity , for minutes			0
' but when his colleague tried to move the mirror to see his creations from a different angle , they were crushed - and the nano sculptures were lost forever			2
elegant : this piece , called trust , was made using ' digital clay ' that was assembled from information contained in hundreds of photographs @entity146 : from this angle of @entity150 and @entity151 the god 's wings can be seen in white and the figures ' legs are stretched out @entity154 : the sculptures , which took 10 months to create , were destroyed when @entity9 's colleague accidentally crushed them with his finger			2

sculptures were so small they could be stood on the head of an ant or balanced on a strand of human hair
artist @entity9 created the extraordinary figures using groundbreaking @entity167 printing technology
he started by taking photos of his naked muse in a @entity172 *warehouse* using more than 200 cameras
needed a microscope used to study cancer cells to see his creations - which were later crushed by his colleague
