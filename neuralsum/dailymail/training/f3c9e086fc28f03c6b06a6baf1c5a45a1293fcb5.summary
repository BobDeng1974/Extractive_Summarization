by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:41 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 20:19 est , 7 january 2013 goodbye : lord @entity4 's resignation was announced as the prime minister and his deputy unveiled a ' mid-term review ' packed with new policy pledges @entity9 and @entity11 ’s attempts to restore @entity13 unity were dealt an embarrassing blow yesterday as the longest - serving member of the @entity17 frontbench quit with a parting blast at the @entity19			1
lord @entity4 , whose resignation was announced as the prime minister and his deputy unveiled a ‘ mid-term review ’ packed with new policy pledges , admitted that in ‘ moments of irritation ’ he ‘ might well have said ’ that the @entity13 had ‘ broken down in the @entity25 ’			1
the cabinet minister said the @entity19 increasingly faced a choice over whether to disrupt individual pieces of legislation or pull together and accept they will be judged on the overall success of the government			2
the leader of the @entity25 is also understood to have grown frustrated at having to steer legislation through the @entity35 in the face of serial rebellions by left - wing @entity19 peers , who mr @entity11 appears unable to control			1
disappointing : @entity9 ( pictured ) and @entity11 's attempts to restore @entity13 unity were dealt an embarrassing blow the announcement of his resignation could not have been more badly timed for mr @entity9 and mr @entity11 , who yesterday refused to rule out another coalition deal after the next general election as they promised help for working families , pensioners and housebuyers			1
both insisted the @entity13 would endure until the day of the next election in may 2015 as they attempted to head off backbench critics who want the two parties to go their separate ways			2
no 10 officials said lord @entity4 , whose wealth is estimated at £ 10million and was an insurance broker before he entered politics , was keen to return to the private sector after 25 years of continuous service on the @entity17 frontbench , 15 of them as leader of the @entity17 peers			1
lord @entity4 , whose full name is @entity68 du @entity66 , was one of the most colourful @entity70 members			1
his parties at @entity17 conferences were famous for bottles of champagne piled high in baths full of ice in his hotel suite , before they were deemed inappropriate in times of austerity			2
@entity17 @entity81 expressed amazement that news of his departure was not released last week , rather than only hours before mr @entity9 and mr @entity11 ’s mid-term review			1
committing the government to 180 policy measures , the prime minister sought to characterise the @entity13 as a ‘ @entity90 deal ’ which ‘ does what it says on the tin ’			1
both he and mr @entity11 declined to rule out a fresh deal between the @entity94 and the @entity19 after 2015 – while mr @entity9 claimed that their sense of ‘ shared purpose ’ had , if anything , grown since 2010			1
the @entity13 document identified six priority areas for reform – childcare , elderly care costs , pensions , housing , personal freedoms and investment in the roads network – with detailed policies due to be unveiled over the next few months			1
plans include underwriting some mortgages , helping first - time buyers who are unable to raise a large deposit , while planning rules will be eased to promote housebuilding			2
working parents are expected to get up to £ 2,000 in help with childcare costs per child , while the potentially huge costs of long - term care for the elderly will be capped – but at a higher level than the £ 35,000 proposed by an independent review			2
asked how his ‘ marriage ’ to mr @entity11 was faring , the prime minister said : ‘ we are married – not to each other			1
we are both happily married			2
this is a government , not a relationship			0
’ mr @entity11 added : ‘ of course we can fight , as we will do , as two separate , independent parties [ at the election ]			1
of course we will set out different visions of the future			0
‘ but we will govern and provide this country with good government until the election is held in may 2015			0
’ the @entity19 leader was scathing about @entity138 ’s opposition to deficit reduction measures – suggesting he would not countenance a coalition deal with @entity141			0
the prime minister insisted he was fighting for a @entity17 majority , but refused to rule out a new power - sharing arrangement , even if he won a small lead in the @entity146			0
but lord @entity4 told @entity147 : ‘ i think all of us would much rather be in a single party government			1
’ the school day should be dramatically extended to ten hours to improve standards and make it easier for parents who work , a group of reforming @entity17 mps said yesterday			0
the 2020 @entity157 group called for pupils to be in class from 8am to 6pm			0
a typical state secondary school day runs from 9am to 3.30pm – just six and a half hours			0
in a report designed to encourage more radical reforms in the public sector , the @entity81 also called for wider study of key languages such as @entity167			0
the report also backs @entity170 ’s plan for benefit rates to be set regionally so state handouts do n’t deter people from working in low income areas			0
the report said : ‘ as both parents are working more hours , schools should facilitate work , at the same time as improving educational standards			0
‘ the length of the school day may need to change			0
in @entity183 schools are open from 8am to 6pm , 360 days a year			0
and if exams are failed , students come back in the holidays to catch up			0

lord @entity4 resigns as @entity188 after almost three years
@entity9 and @entity11 unveiled ' mid-term review ' with new policy pledges
