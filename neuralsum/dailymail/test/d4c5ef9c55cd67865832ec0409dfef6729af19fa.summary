stunned researchers have found one of the @entity3 's most important manuscripts is full of ghosts			0
dating from 1250 , @entity5 is the earliest surviving medieval manuscript written solely in @entity7 , and contains some of the earliest references to @entity9 and @entity10			1
now , researchers have found a series of hidden faces and message in it			0

using a combination of ultraviolet light and photo editing software , the images were recovered			2
dating from 1250 , @entity5 is the earliest surviving medieval manuscript written solely in @entity7 , and contains some of the earliest references to @entity9 and @entity10			1
the book is a collection of 9th - 12th century poetry along both religious and secular lines , and draws on the traditions of the @entity7 folk - heroes and legends of the @entity27			1
' it 's easy to think we know all we can know about a manuscript like the @entity31 but to see these ghosts from the past brought back to life in front of our eyes has been incredibly exciting , ' said @entity37 of @entity39 's @entity38 , @entity40 and @entity41			2
the book is a collection of 9th - 12th century poetry along both religious and secular lines , and draws on the traditions of the @entity7 folk - heroes and legends of the @entity27			1
@entity37 and professor @entity45 from @entity39 's @entity38 , @entity40 and @entity41 ( @entity46 ) , believe that a 16th century owner of the book , probably a man named @entity48 , erased centuries ' worth of additional verse , doodles and marginalia which had been added to the manuscript as it changed hands throughout the years			1
using a combination of ultraviolet light and photo editing software , the 16th century owner 's penchant for erasure has been partly reversed to reveal snatches of poetry			1
currently , the texts are very fragmentary and in need of much more analysis , although they researchers say they seem to be the continuation of a poem on the preceding page with a new poem added at the foot of the page			0
' the drawings and verse that we 're in the process of recovering demonstrate the value of giving these books another look , ' @entity37 said			0
' the margins of manuscripts often contain medieval and early modern reactions to the text , and these can cast light on what our ancestors thought about what they were reading			0
' @entity5 was particularly heavily annotated before the end of the 16th century , and the recovery of erasure has much to tell us about what was already there and can change our understanding of it			1
' the faces are only visible under uv light - and are invisible to the naked eye @entity37 and @entity45 will present a lecture at @entity103 today , part of a larger exhibition on the life and work of sir @entity108 , one - time owner of the @entity31			0
there , they will detail some of their findings , stressing the importance of continued research on the manuscript			0
' what we have discovered may only be the tip of the iceberg in terms of what can be discovered as imaging techniques are enhanced , ' said @entity45			0
' the manuscript is extremely valuable and incredibly important – yet there may still be so much we do n't know about it			0
' despite its value today , the @entity5 ( so called because of the colour of its binding ) was not an elaborate production , but rather the work of a single scribe who was probably collecting and recording over a long period of his life			2
this is readily visible on the manuscript pages themselves ; the first pages feature a large textura script copied on alternating ruled lines , while in other parts of the manuscript – perhaps when vellum was scarce – the hand is very much smaller and the lines per page tight and many			0
measuring approximately only 17cm by 12.5 cm , the book is made up of 54 pages of vellum ( animal hide ) and came to the @entity103 in 1904 after being bought , alongside other manuscripts , by the @entity103 's founder , sir @entity149			0
an example of the latter is the earliest poem concerning the adventures of the legendary @entity9 , which sees the famed hero seeking entrance to an unidentified court and expounding the virtues of his men in order to gain admittance			1
other heroes are praised and lamented in a lengthy text known as @entity164 , the @entity164 , in which a narrator presents geographic lore by claiming to know the burial places of upwards of eighty warriors			0
@entity9 makes an appearance here as well , but only insofar as to say that he can not be found : anoeth bid bet y arthur , ' the grave of @entity9 is a wonder '			2
other famous figures also appear throughout , including @entity176 , perhaps more familiarly known by the @entity177 ' @entity10 '			2
there are two prophetic poems attributed to him during his ' wild man ' phase located in the middle of the manuscript , but additionally the very first poem of the book is presented as a dialogue between him and the celebrated @entity7 poet @entity189			1
since the creation of @entity193 's @entity192 in the 12th century there has been a connection between @entity195 and @entity10 , and it may be no accident that the @entity31 opens with this text .			1

@entity5 is the earliest surviving @entity7 manuscript
