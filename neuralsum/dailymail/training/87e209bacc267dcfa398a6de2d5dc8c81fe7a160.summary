next time you want to remember a piece of information , save it as a file on your phone or computer			2
the act of digitally storing files containing useful or important data boosts memory and the brain 's ability to remember future events , according to researchers			2
this is because the brain knows the original information is safely stored , which ultimately frees up cognitive resources that can focus on learning and remembering new facts and figures			1
when files are digitally saved , the brain knows the information is stored safely and can be accessed when needed			1
this frees up cognitive resources that can be used to remember new facts and figures , according to researchers from the @entity27 lead author , assistant professor @entity28 of the @entity27 , said : ‘ our findings show that people are significantly better at learning and remembering new information when they save previous information			1
‘ the idea is pretty simple : @entity36 acts as a form of offloading			0
‘ by ensuring that certain information will be digitally accessible , we can re-allocate cognitive resources			2
researchers from @entity44 , the @entity41 and @entity42 recently found that many people now use the internet in place of a memory			0
they claimed that when someone wants to know something they now use the internet as an ‘ external memory ’ just as computers use an external hard drive			2
the study continued that we are now so reliant on smartphones and laptops , we go into ‘ withdrawal when we ca n’t find out something immediately ’			0
elsewhere , experts from @entity62 in @entity63 warned that the obsession with recording and sharing every moment could be having an adverse effect on our memories			0
one psychologist claimed people are becoming increasingly unable to live in the moment			0
they say the phenomenon is ' kind of a loss '			0
‘ we tend to think of forgetting as happening when memory fails , but research suggests that forgetting plays an essential role in supporting the adaptive functioning of memory and cognition			0
’ the researchers set out to challenge previous studies that indicated saving information on a digital device , such as a computer or camera , hinders later memory for it			0
in the first study , 20 students used computers to open and study pairs of @entity93 and @entity94 both files contained a list of 10 nouns			1
the students had 20 seconds to study @entity93 before closing the file , with half being told to save it			1
they then studied @entity101 for 20 seconds and were immediately tested on how many nouns they could remember , before being tested on their memory for @entity106 the students remembered more words from @entity108 when they had saved @entity93 than when they had simply closed it , according to the report published in @entity110			1
a second study with a separate group of 48 undergraduates saw the same results			2
the second study revealed that the saving - related memory effects depended on how reliable the students thought the saving process was			2
when the students were told that the saved version of @entity93 might not stick , they showed no saving - related memory benefits			1
if they thought saving was unreliable , students ’ memory for @entity108 was the same regardless of whether they saved @entity123 students used computers to study pairs of @entity127 files			1
the students had 20 seconds to study @entity93 before closing it , with half being told to save it			1
they then studied @entity108 , and were tested on the details on both			1
students remembered more from @entity101 when they had saved @entity93 than when they simply closed it professor @entity28 said : ‘ as technology develops , computers and smart phones are making it easier and easier to save information , which seems to have important consequences for the ways in which our memory functions			1
‘ by treating computers and other digital devices as extensions of memory , people may be protecting themselves from the costs of forgetting while taking advantage of the benefits			0
’ the researchers believe that the memory benefits of saving previous information may even have broad implications for how we think more generally			0
‘ coming up with a new idea or solving a problem often requires that we think outside the box , so to speak , and forgetting previous information allows us to do that , ' continued professor @entity28			0
‘ by helping us to reduce the accessibility of old information , saving may facilitate our ability to think of new ideas and solve difficult problems			0
