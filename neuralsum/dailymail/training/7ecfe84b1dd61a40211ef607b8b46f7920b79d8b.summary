by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 in the exceptionally difficult and frustrating circumstances , @entity3 ’s coaches have put together a side that , in most areas , has enough quality to challenge the @entity8			1
@entity9 and his assistants have had to choose from a significantly diluted pool of available players , given the enforced absence of more than a dozen leading men , including five @entity15			1
yet , the line - up they have selected to play at @entity18 reflects the enhanced depth at their disposal in the majority of positions			0
there ’s no @entity25 at loosehead prop , but @entity27 is a powerful deputy who has had a fine season			0
@entity29 is not on tour , but @entity31 filled in at tighthead with distinction during the @entity34			0
in the second row , @entity35 will be hugely missed but @entity37 – who started in @entity38 when the @entity15 won their series against @entity40 last summer – is a reliable figure to fill the void and run the lineout with supreme expertise			0
big test : @entity46 was an outside candidate but injuries have helped the fly half back into the team in the back row , @entity3 are without @entity51 and @entity52 , but @entity53 is a recent starter at @entity54 and a potent ball - carrier , while @entity56 deserves his opportunity at blindside on the strength of test - class form in the latter part of the club season			1
the flanker has been the man for a crisis before – producing a stunning defensive performance when the shattered and depleted national team held firm to draw with the @entity68 in @entity69 two years ago			0
the management will desperately hope that @entity71 overcomes his shoulder problem to start this series opener , as he was the high - octane catalyst for so much of their best attacking work during the @entity34			1
@entity77 is an experienced replacement if necessary , but he does not have the momentum of prime form from the domestic campaign to take into the match			1
@entity83 will provide a marauding threat to the @entity8 from outside centre – as he has done in the past – while @entity87 is capable of carving up the home defence in keeping with recent heroics			2
@entity9 will also be happy enough with his wing combination of @entity91 and @entity92			2
the primary problems lie at hooker and in the 10 - 12 area			0
@entity96 will be expected to hit the ground running in the no 2 shirt , despite not playing for a month due to a knee injury			2
@entity100 is poised to return in @entity101 next week , so @entity96 must somehow deliver similar physicality , nous and lineout - throwing precision before making way for the first - choice man in that position			2
plunged into action : @entity77 could play at scrum half if @entity71 fails to make the cut @entity87 , @entity91 , @entity83 , @entity111 , may , @entity46 , @entity71 , @entity27 , @entity96 , @entity31 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity56 , @entity53 , @entity114 @entity3 are pitching @entity46 in at fly half in a selection based on reputation rather than form			1
his game collapsed during the season amid rumours about his move to @entity123 from @entity124 and there is precious little evidence yet that he has regained sufficient conviction to run the show with authority			0
but , with @entity131 and @entity132 not able to play due to jet - lag protocols and @entity134 recovering at home after shoulder surgery , @entity130 have erred on the side of familiarity by preferring @entity46 to @entity139			2
now they must hold their breath and hope			0
it is a similar scenario at inside centre , where @entity3 are temporarily without @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 – who plays at @entity148 for @entity149 – so @entity150 is the last man standing			1
he was superb in @entity153 last summer but sending him out to face the world champions in a stadium where they have n’t lost for 20 years is a high - stakes way of assessing whether he has the big - game attributes to cut it at @entity161			0
so much will depend on how @entity46 and @entity150 acquit themselves in defence			1
the doomsday scenario involves @entity165 repeatedly hurtling through flimsy tackles in that area and igniting all black attacks in open space			0
the optimistic outlook is that a strong @entity3 pack dominate possession and @entity46 gives the tourists territorial advantage			1
yet , even if that vision is achieved , @entity8 have more potency to summon from the bench , so if they have n’t taken control by the hour mark , they surely will in the final quarter			0
the acid test : @entity9 ( left ) takes @entity3 to @entity8 to face the might of the @entity8			1

@entity3 are depleted but still have the players to challenge @entity8
@entity96 , @entity46 and @entity150 all have important roles
@entity9 *sweating* on the **fitness** of scrum half @entity71
@entity77 will step up if @entity71 fails late **fitness** test ahead of match
