by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:55 est , 3 december 2013 @entity3 : 07:19 est , 4 december 2013 the @entity4 has admitted faking key scenes in a hit nature documentary about grizzly bears			1
programme makers were forced to apologise after it emerged hit @entity9 show @entity10 deliberately misled viewers by carefully editing footage			1
a dramatic episode appeared to show one of the documentary 's expert guides watching and commentating as a mother bear took her cubs into the ocean , before one of them drowned			1
in fact , the guide – @entity24 – was never present at the touching scene			2
@entity28 separately , the shots of him standing by the seaside were later edited together with the original footage to make it seem he was just yards from the dangerous animals			1
the truth was only revealed yesterday – more than seven months after it was aired on tv – after an investigation by the @entity4 ’s governing body found the public were ‘ misled ’ and trust in the @entity4 could be damaged			2
up close , but not too close : a bear inspects a remote camera in the documentary @entity10			2
but the show has been criticised for being less than honest it is the latest in a series of fakery rows to engulf the @entity4 ’s respected natural history unit , and comes just two years after it was revealed sir @entity48 ’s @entity47 series had shown supposedly wild footage of a polar bear and her cubs – which was actually filmed in a zoo			1
last night @entity55 mp @entity54 , who chairs the @entity56 , said it was ‘ completely unacceptable ’ to fake footage , adding : ‘ it is wrong to mislead viewers , and as has been the case in the past , if you have to edit footage so things are not exactly as they were , you should explain to viewers why that has happened			1
‘ otherwise , the danger is people stop believing in the truth of these programmes and viewers ’ confidence in the @entity4 ’s output will be undermined			2
‘ i welcome the fact the @entity75 have recognised that this was misleading and wrong			0
’ in its damning report yesterday , the corporation ’s governing body admitted the latest scandal could further damage the public ’s faith in its output			0
it said : ‘ viewers were on a journey with the guide and this was a crucial event which was interpreted through the eyes of the guide			0
on location ? the @entity10 team , including @entity24 ( centre ) , pose up for the camera at @entity94 , @entity95 ‘ the trustees agreed that it was not acceptable to portray him as if he was present when he was not present			0
the public had been misled			0
’ saying the @entity4 ’s natural history programming is ‘ one of the jewels in the crown of @entity105 broadcasting ’ , the @entity75 report continued : ‘ enactments of this nature could undermine the trust of the public in the @entity4 ’s natural history programmes and even risked casting doubt on the accuracy of the natural history depicted in the @entity4 ’s programmes			0
‘ this would be an extremely unfortunate outcome which could damage a world class brand			0
’ filmed in @entity95 , @entity10 drew plaudits when it was screened in april and captivated almost four million viewers			2
the fake scene – contained in the first of four episodes – showed a mother bear , @entity123 , taking her two cubs @entity124 and @entity126 into the ocean			1
@entity126 was washed away by the waves and presumed drowned			0
' it is wrong to mislead viewers and , as has been the case in the past , if you have to edit footage so things are not exactly as they were , you should explain to viewers why that has happened			2
otherwise the danger is people stop believing in the truth of these programmes and viewers ’ confidence in the @entity4 ’s output will be undermined ' - mp @entity54 the @entity75 said producers gave repeated reassurances the shot was accurate			1
they did not reveal the true sequence of events because they felt it was ‘ acceptable ’ and ‘ did not alter the editorial truth of the scene ’			0
the report added : ‘ it was only when a planned radio interview proposed to feature the cub - drowning sequence that the bear guide flagged up the fact that he had not actually been present at the time			1
’ in the wake of the revelations , the @entity4 required all natural history staff to carry out new training into editorial standards			0
the show ’s executive producer @entity165 said : ‘ please accept my apologies for this mistake			0
@entity169 is taking immediate steps to address the issues raised and to prevent similar issues occurring by providing additional training across the entire unit			0
’ following the @entity47 scandal in 2011 , sir @entity48 – who narrated the series – defended the footage by saying he was ‘ making movies ’			1
last year , an episode of @entity180 – starring @entity181 and @entity182 – was slammed by viewers after it emerged most of the first episode was in fact pre-recorded .			1

scenes showed expert just yards from touching scenes of mother and cub
but the shots of him were filmed separately and edited into footage
comes two years after @entity47 passed off zoo - filmed scenes as ' wild ' footage , and a year after @entity180 was revealed as pre-recorded
mp @entity200 said faking footage was ' completely unacceptable '
