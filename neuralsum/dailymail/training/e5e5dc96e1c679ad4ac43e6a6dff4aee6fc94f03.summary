by @entity0 when a severe storm threatened his boat on a dark winter ’s night , @entity1 refused to abandon ship			1
although council officials told him to get to safety , the captain feared his passenger ferry could be a danger to the public if she broke her moorings in the massive tidal surge while unattended			1
but the council saw things differently – and when mr @entity1 , 62 , would not take their advice and leave the boat , they responded by calling the police , who pepper - sprayed the grandfather of three and handcuffed him before throwing him in a cell			1
captain at the helm : @entity1 , 62 , was pepper - sprayed and handcuffed by police when he refused to leave his boat he is now demanding an apology after a charge of resisting arrest was dropped when a judge said police did not have ‘ the power to force him off his boat ’ and @entity31 evidence showed he had not put up a fight			1
mr @entity1 did not want to comment yesterday because his official complaint is being reviewed by @entity36			1
but his wife @entity37 , 53 , said : ‘ we ’ve got a complaint in but it is not about money or anything like that			0
my husband just wants an apology			0
’ after the court case was dropped , mr @entity1 said : ‘ i am still bewildered about how the whole situation came about			2
what should have been a simple passing of high water with my presence , just in case it was needed to attend to any problem that could have arisen , instead turned into an unnecessarily traumatic night			0
‘ the whole thing was instigated by people who do n’t understand the river or marine situations			2
‘ all other boats ... at affected marinas up and down the country would have had crew standing watch on them that night			0
you ca n’t separate a boat from its owner			0
a boat without a person is a liability			0
’ mr @entity1 has been operating @entity70 on the @entity71 since 2000			2
his boat carries up to 15 passengers between the historic centre of @entity75 and @entity70 , a route that has been in operation since 1285			1
ancient crossing : a ferry route over the @entity71 , pictured , has been operating since 1285 he has also assisted with rescue operations on the river in the past at the request of emergency services			2
on the night of december 5 last year , a high tide combined with the worst storms @entity88 had seen in 60 years led to flooding at @entity90 and @entity91 in @entity75 and caused severe damage to eastern coastlines			1
lifelong sailor mr @entity1 informed the council he planned to moor his ferry , which had no passengers on board , on the pontoon at @entity90			1
an official said he could use the pontoon but ordered him to leave the boat			1
when he refused , police arrived , incapacitating him with pepper spray before manhandling him off the boat			1
he was taken to a police station and put in a cell to await an interview			0
afterwards , he made several appearances at @entity108 ’ court and a date had been set for his trial			0
throughout the process he was refused legal aid , leaving him out of pocket			0
it was only in april , four months after his ordeal began , that district judge @entity115 said : ‘ i do n’t think the police had the power to force him off his boat			2
they could have said , “ if you want to stay , fine , but we are not responsible for your safety ” and walked away			0
’ the @entity124 dropped the case , saying there was ‘ no longer a realistic prospect of conviction ’			0
mr @entity1 , who lives in @entity70 , added at the time : ‘ i was not aggressive or abusive to the three police officers and was within my legal rights to remain on my boat			1
’ a @entity124 spokesman said the case was dropped after @entity31 footage of the incident was reviewed			0
@entity36 said : ‘ we have received a complaint from mr @entity1 and an investigation is ongoing			2
