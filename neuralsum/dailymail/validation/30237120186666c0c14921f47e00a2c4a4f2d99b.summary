@entity2 ' @entity1 side ended their long wait for an away win in the @entity5 as they triumphed 1 - 0 at @entity6			1
@entity1 were the only @entity5 side without a win on the road this season going into monday 's clash at the @entity11 , but they finally got that monkey off their backs courtesy of @entity15 's second - half header			1
the @entity1 academy product rose highest to nod home @entity21 's accurate free - kick off a post in the 66th minute , although @entity6 keeper @entity19 will be disappointed at not being able to stop it			2
@entity15 celebrates his second - half header which secured all three points for @entity1 @entity15 is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates after scoring the only goal of the game on monday @entity2 pays tribute to the travelling fans after @entity1 claimed their first win on the road @entity2 ' men have moved up to 10th in the table @entity33 takes @entity1 up to 10th , level on 33 points with ninth - placed @entity36 , while @entity6 remain 13th			1
@entity2 ' side , who like @entity6 came into this game on the back of two wins and a defeat in their last three matches , saw plenty of ball early on but did little with it			0
the hosts looked sluggish during the opening exchanges , but they had a penalty appeal turned down in the ninth minute			0
@entity50 cut into the box and just as he looked to get it out of his feet and pull the trigger he was stopped in his tracks by a bumbling challenge from @entity1 centre - back @entity15			1
referee @entity58 waved away the appeals , but the incident sparked @entity6 into life and @entity63 ' side should have taken the lead when @entity65 beat three defenders and then disappointingly toe - poked straight at @entity1 's grateful keeper @entity67			1
@entity50 came within inches of opening the scoring after 20 minutes when he exquisitely curled onto the bar from the corner of the box			0
@entity6 goalkeeper @entity19 dives helplessly as @entity15 's second - half header sails past his grasp @entity76 ( right ) and @entity6 's defender @entity77 battle for the ball during the monday night clash @entity2 shakes hands with @entity6 's head coach @entity81 ahead of the @entity5 encounter @entity67 was beaten all ends up as the ambitious shot sailed over his head and he - as well as everyone else - no doubt expected it to miss the target comfortably , but a deceptive dip saw it drop down sharply and clip the frame of the goal			1
@entity92 had a few headed chances as @entity1 began to show more in the final third , but @entity50 went close with a wicked shot from distance before @entity96 was bravely thwarted by @entity67 in a goalmouth scramble as it remained 0 - 0 at the interval			0
@entity99 starred as @entity1 upped the tempo in the second half , first rounding three defenders and then forcing a good save out of @entity103 , before desperate defending blocked his goal - bound shot from hitting an empty net in the 57th minute			2
@entity15 made the pressure count by leaping highest to head @entity21 's pinpoint free - kick in with the help of a post as @entity19 got close to clawing it away after it bounced off his right upright , but fell just short of getting a good enough contact			2
with @entity6 frustrations boiling over after the goal , @entity116 protested too loudly when his penalty appeal for a challenge by @entity15 and @entity21 was rejected and he was duly booked by @entity58			0
the hosts frantically probed for an equaliser late on , with @entity123 again forcing @entity67 into another good save with six minutes remaining , but @entity1 held out to finally get a reward on their travels .			0
