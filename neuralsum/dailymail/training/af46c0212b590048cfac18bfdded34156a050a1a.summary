by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 11:47 est , 16 november 2012 a dementia - suffering pensioner was sent home from hospital with a tube still in her arm , barefoot and naked except for an open - backed @entity8 gown			1
@entity9 , 77 , from @entity10 , was admitted to @entity11 last wednesday , after suffering a mini-stroke			1
the mother of seven was discharged on saturday , and was sent home in an ambulance because her daughter , @entity16 , with whom she lives , was at work			1
blunder : @entity9 pictured after she was discharged wearing only a hospital gown ( left ) and with a tube still in her arm ( right ) but when her mother arrived home @entity23 - herself a carer - was horrified to find a cannula , which was used for an intravenous drip , was still in her arm			1
and despite the winter cold @entity28 , who has vascular dementia and diabetes , was wearing just a hospital gown with her clean and pressed nightclothes still unworn in her suitcase			1
ms @entity16 said the blundering hospital staff were forced to send a rapid response team to quickly and safely remove the cannula still in her mother ’s arm before it became infected			2
the hospital has since apologised to ms @entity16 and mrs @entity9 and has said an investigation has been launched			1
disgusted : @entity16 and her mother , @entity9 , 77			1
ms @entity16 is now launching a complaint about her mother 's care			2
ms @entity16 said : ' it ’s disgusting			2
' i ’m a carer myself and i always think ‘ what if that was me in that bed or chair ? how would i want to be treated ? ’ ' you think they are in the best place for them , in the hospital , and this makes me not want to send her there any more			0
' she must ’ve been freezing			0
i took her straight upstairs and washed her			0
i took a photo of the cannula and what she looked like - it was just shocking			0
' now @entity23 , 43 , said she is considering making a formal complaint			0
she said : ' it upsets me to think that people get treated like that			0
i know they are overworked but i do n’t know how they can work there and not care			0
' i feel because she is a certain age and has dementia , they thought ‘ she ’s got dementia , she ’ll never know			2
’ ' @entity76 , @entity10 hospital chief nurse , said : ' we are very sorry for mrs @entity9 ’s experience and , after speaking with her daughter earlier this week , are already underway with a thorough investigation			1
apology : @entity11 is already underway with a thorough investigation			0
