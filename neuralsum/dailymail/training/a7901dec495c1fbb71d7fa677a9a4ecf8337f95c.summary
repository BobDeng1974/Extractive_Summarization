by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 18:05 est , 13 november 2013 moved on : @entity0 has no regrets about splitting from her husband the babysitter is booked , my little black dress has been dry - cleaned and several pairs of killer heels lie scattered on the bedroom floor			1
carefully applying oxblood red varnish to my nails , i struggle to recall when i last took so much time and trouble getting ready for a night out			2
but i have waited too long for this date to rush things and risk stepping out in the wrong outfit			2
tonight , i want to look fabulous			2
because tonight , i 'm meeting my ex-husband 's new girlfriend for the first time			2
as i walk into the restaurant , my ex , @entity20 , and his new lover are already there			1
as she smiles and offers her hand , i 'm struck by how similar we look - she is slightly fairer , but we are the same age and build			2
she 's wearing a little black dress , too			2
i notice her looking at @entity20 as i once did almost 20 years ago when we first met at an @entity30 language school in @entity31			1
she is bubbly , attentive and excited to be with him			2
@entity20 's physical renaissance is inescapable , too			1
the weight he 'd gained in the last stale years of our marriage has melted away			1
he has new @entity38 glasses and is sporting sharp new threads			2
as i watch him unable to take his eyes off her , i try to pinpoint the emotion i 'm feeling			2
jealousy ? bitterness ? grief for the remnants of our 15 - year marriage ? not a bit of it			1
in fact , all i feel is unmitigated joy			0
i could cartwheel across the room with happiness			0
i 'm delighted that my former husband has finally found love again two and a half years after our divorce			1
eighteen months ago i , too , fell head over heels with a new man			0
in fact , @entity58 accompanies me on this date to the restaurant and the four of us share a lovely evening			0
but rewind three years and the thought of actually wanting to spend time with @entity20 was inconceivable			1
we first met in @entity66 while i was teaching @entity30 , and @entity20 - who was a year older than me at 29 - was one of my pupils : a sharp dresser with movie - star sunglasses and a keen intellect			1
we fell for each other and moved to @entity72 in 1997 , setting up home in @entity74			1
for the first few years we were very happy			1
@entity20 was fun and we had a great social life			1
but like many long - term relationships , our marriage had started straining at the seams once we 'd had our ( much wanted and deeply loved ) children			1
brawls about housework , childcare and bringing home enough bacon eroded the love we had once shared			0
our arguments were all about the marital division of labour - i felt i was doing the lion 's share			0
in the end , our rows became so unpleasant , so frequent and so personal that i asked for a separation in november 2009			0
and the aftermath of our split was unusual in that when @entity20 left the family home on may 1 , 2010 , he also left the country			1
he returned to his native @entity31 where , a couple of months before our separation , he had landed his dream job as a project manager for an architect			0
young love : the writer and @entity20 in the mid nineties finally , i was on my own , and it was such a relief not to have to nag him about the dirty socks under the bed and stubble in the sink			1
far from feeling lonely , i felt wonderful waking up without him			0
but i was also left feeling terribly sad for my daughter and son , then nine and two			0
when i planned my family , this was not how i imagined the plot would turn out , and i felt guilty that @entity20 and i had failed at our marriage			1
from the outset , we agreed that when @entity20 visited the children every couple of months , he would stay with us			1
he no longer had a home in @entity72 and i did n't want their precious daddy - time to be spent in anonymous @entity124 and fast food outlets			0
it was emotionally important for our beloved children to see that the two people who had brought them into the world could actually be in the same room without biting each other 's heads off			1
but i can not pretend that i enjoyed @entity20 's visits			1
they were a hard exercise in civility and restraint - and having him back in my home reminded me of the mountain of irritations behind our failed marriage			0
' i had moved on , which was wonderful for me , but can not have been easy for @entity20 , and i felt a scintilla of sympathy for him ' why could n't he read a bedtime story without falling asleep before the children ? why did he spend so much time mouldering on the sofa ? i 'm sure @entity20 had his own simmering irritations - even if , for the children 's sake , we were careful not to let them bubble over into actual rows			1
while married , he 'd always accused me of nagging and that i did n't know how to relax			1
on the rare moments we found ourselves in a room without the children , it certainly felt awkward			1
that awkwardness became even more acute when , two years after our separation , i met @entity58			1
suddenly , a new and exciting chapter had opened in my life			0
i had moved on , which was wonderful for me , but can not have been easy for @entity20 , and i felt a scintilla of sympathy for him			1
it was n't as if i could hide my new man on my ex 's visits			0
@entity58 lives in the same @entity74 mansion block as me - a friend joked that i 'd ended up with a 56 - year - old boy - next - door			0
a couple of months into our relationship , he was keen to be formally introduced to my former husband - to ' be clear and straight about things '			1
even though i was confident @entity20 was glad we had separated , the tensions between us were still palpable			1
openly parading my new man would have felt like rubbing salt into a not - quite - healed wound			0
@entity20 and i were friendly in a perfunctory sort of way , but we were definitely not friends			1
on good terms : @entity189 with his wife , @entity190 , left , is still friends with his first wife , @entity192 , right , with whom he has children including daughter @entity194 , second from right but then , one magic weekend six months ago , everything changed			1
it was one of @entity20 's visits to see the children , and the minute he walked through the door i knew things were different			1
for what felt like the first time in years , he smiled at me properly and bent down and gave me a continental peck on the cheek			1
it was surprising and lovely in equal measure			0
he 'd slimmed down and was wearing smart new clothes			0
one word sprang to mind : girlfriend			0
later that night , when the children were in bed , @entity20 confirmed my happy suspicions			1
my ex had a new woman , an architect who also lived in @entity31			0
he was n't sure how long it would last , but he was very keen on her			0
' i know , ' i said			0
' your whole being is grinning			0
' and i really did know			0
it was a familiar grin			0
i 'd undergone a similar renaissance in the early weeks of my relationship with @entity58 when i 'd finally lost my baby weight , bought new lingerie - the kind favoured by @entity230 politicians ' mistresses - and starting paying for aggressive depilation			2
i can genuinely say i felt nothing but delight for @entity20			1
these days , he and i grin a lot more at each other , too , and it feels so good			2
after years of sniping and nastiness , our children sense their parents ' genuine friendship , their pleasure in each other 's company			1
split ends the number of couples who divorce has been falling since reaching a peak of 165,000 in 1993 but i am not deluding myself			2
my offspring would no doubt be cheerier still if their mother and father were happily married			2
yet , given that we are n't , we are surely in a better place than we were			0
in a society where 42 per cent of marriages end , many of them with children in the equation , friendship between exes is surely the way forward			2
it is obviously far more pleasant for everyone if former spouses get on			0
what 's strange is that i never really thought i could be one of those former spouses			0
i always wanted to be good friends with @entity20 , but deep down i feared the conventional wisdom was probably right : you ca n't really be proper friends with someone who has seen you naked			1
indeed , when my divorced friends told me they got on brilliantly with their exes and that all the rancour had gone , i was sceptical			2
but thinking about them now , i realise they all have one crucial thing in common : they all have new partners			0
they are on an equal footing			0
like me and my ex - he 's happy , i 'm happy			0
we can both start again			0
i now see that one of the biggest casualties of our relationship was respect			2
i had stopped admiring the man mouldering on the sofa , the snoring form in bed with whom i 'd shared a marriage and a mortgage for more years than i wanted to remember , and had started taking him for granted			2
and i would say he had done exactly the same with me			0
now when i see him smiling at his new lover , my only thought is : ' good on you , my friend			0
i wish you every happiness in the world			0

@entity0 and @entity20 were married for 15 years and had two children
but their relationship became stale and stressful
they *decided* to split as they were always arguing
@entity0 then met someone new
she was delighted when her ex husband did the same
she feels they can truly be friends now as they *'ve* both moved on
