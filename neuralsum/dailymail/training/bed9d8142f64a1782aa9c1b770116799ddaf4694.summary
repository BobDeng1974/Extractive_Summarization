by @entity0 , defence correspondent general sir @entity1 , head of the @entity2 , warned further savings would damage ' our chances of success on the battlefields ' @entity11 's chances of winning future wars will be ‘ seriously damaged ’ by more crippling spending cuts , the country ’s top soldier has warned			1
general sir @entity1 , the head of the @entity2 , said further savings likely to be ordered by the government could prove ‘ quite dangerous , quite soon ’			1
under current plans , the size of the @entity2 is being reduced from 102,000 three years ago to 82,000 – small enough for every soldier to fit inside @entity19			1
the latest raft of around 5,000 redundancies will be confirmed on tuesday , shrinking the number of personnel to 90,000 – its lowest level since before the @entity25 began 200 years ago			1
but the @entity26 is expected to be ordered by the @entity27 to make further cuts of at least £ 1billion			2
last night general @entity1 raised concerns about demanding more savings of the @entity32			1
he said : ‘ imposing more on us now before the last round of efficiencies have really materialised properly in a balanced way would be very disruptive			0
‘ we have got to the point in certain areas where we ca n’t go any further without seriously damaging our professional competence and our chances of success on the battlefields of the future			0
’ he told @entity45 ’s @entity44 that further cuts would leave the @entity2 ‘ close ’ to dysfunctional			1
former commanders have warned the controversial cuts are too deep , leaving the @entity2 perilously overstretched and unable to take on all the major military commitments demanded by ministers			1
some 5,000 personnel each from the @entity52 and @entity53 have already been made redundant			0
general sir @entity1 said any further savings could prove ' quite dangerous , quite soon ' ( file picture ) the government wants to reshape the @entity2 , replacing regular troops by doubling the number of part - time soldiers to 30,000			1
top brass have also been forced to sacrifice aircraft carriers , fast jets and armoured vehicles to save £ 4.7billion and meet a £ 38billion overspend in the equipment budget			0
defence secretary @entity66 said the financial bombardment from chancellor @entity68 would damage our defence capability			0
he said : ' simply trying to salami slice across all areas is likely to lead to the worst possible outcome			0
' if we have to make further reductions , i would rather identify specific areas and capabilities that we will agree to gap for a period of time and accept and manage the risks that are involved			0
5,000 personnel each from the @entity52 and @entity53 have already been made redundant lieutenant general @entity84 , the most senior @entity11 soldier in @entity85 and the architect of the blueprint to shake up the @entity2 by 2020 , said the responsibility for any weakening of the @entity11 ’s defence should lie with the @entity27			2
he said : ' at the end of the day our politicians need to decide what they want the @entity2 to do			2
' if they determine that the @entity2 is going to do less , it 's reasonable for them to reduce it still further			2
' we are bound as military people to point out the risks during the course of this to our political masters and ultimately it 's down to them to look themselves in the mirror each morning and determine whether or not those risks are manageable			0

general sir @entity1 said more cuts could be ' quite dangerous , quite soon '
size of the @entity2 is being reduced from 102,000 three years ago to 82,000
@entity2 will be at lowest level since before the @entity25
