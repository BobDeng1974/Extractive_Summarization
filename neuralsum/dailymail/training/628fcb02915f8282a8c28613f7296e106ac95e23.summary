since launching last friday more than 10 million people have picked up the @entity1 , @entity2 ’s ‘ bigger and better ’ version of the @entity3 6			0
but for some , bigger is n’t necessarily better and the larger screen can pose a problem when trying to use the device with one hand			2
with that in mind , a @entity9 company has devised an extension for your thumb that lets you access the entire screen while holding the phone in one hand			1
called the @entity22 - which translates as ' finger growth ' - the hollow silicone device helps you reach the entire screen with one hand			1
this is especially useful for larger phones like the @entity1 @entity19 - based @entity30 's thumb - shaped style , called the @entity22 - which translates to ‘ finger growth ’ - retails for £ 8.51 ( $ 13.63 )			1
made of silicon , the fake digit weighs 0.024lbs ( 11g ) and is hollow inside so it can be worn on a thumb or finger			1
at its tip is a small black conductor , which ensures that modern touchscreens can register it when it makes contact			1
wearing the extender means that , with one hand , most people will be able to access the entirety of a phone screen with one hand			0
this will also reduce instances where a palm accidentally brushes the screen and registers an input			0
so - called phablets , the mid-point device between phones and tablets , such as the @entity1 are becoming increasingly popular in @entity57			1
in 2013 , phablets overtook shipments of laptops and tablets for the first time in @entity57			0
to make them appeal more to people used to smaller screens , @entity2 included a ‘ reachability ’ feature with the @entity3			0
when the home button is double tapped , the screen shifts down to the lower half , making things easier to reach with one hand			0
the @entity1 is 7.78cm ( 3.06 inches ) wide , while other large phones include the @entity70 , which is 7.92cm ( 3.12 ) inches wide			2
of course , that ’s just from side - to - side - diagonally the 6 @entity74 is 14cm ( 5.5 inches ) , and the @entity70 is 14.5cm ( 5.7 inches )			0
the average male thumb is 6.96cm ( 2.74 ) inches long and for women it ’s 6.32cm ( 2.49 inches )			0
clearly this poses a problem , as the average thumb can not stretch from one side of a phone to the other without part of the palm touching the screen , which can accidentally register an input			0
using the @entity89 thumb extender , though , 0.6inches ( 1.5 cm ) is added to the length of the thumb			2
this means people can more easily reach from side of the phone to the other - as long as they do n’t mind wearing the extender			0
the fake thumb extender is placed on the end of a thumb or finger and extends the reach ( left ) by 0.6inches ( 1.5cm )			1
a black conductor at the end ( right ) ensures its touch is registered on the screen			1
the device retails for £ 8.51 ( $ 13.93 ) and weighs 0.024lbs ( 11g ) the gadget is somewhat reminiscent of the ' @entity109 ' from the tv show @entity110			1
in the episode ' @entity111 ( picutred ) uses a ' what if ' machine to humourously imagine how useful a device might have been - if he ever invented it the company said this is especially useful for commuters travelling by train who often stand up while holding onto a handrail			0
attempting to use a larger phone in this scenario can be difficult - a problem they say is solved with this thumb extender			1
and it ’s not just for the @entity1 that the thumb is designed ; other larger phones , including the @entity70 , can also make use of it			1
‘ this was n’t specifically designed for the new iphone but for overall smartphones because screen sizes are getting larger and difficult to handle , ’ a spokesperson for @entity18 told the @entity133			0
the company @entity18 says the thumb extender is especially useful for commuters travelling by train who often stand up while holding onto a handrail			2
attempting to use a larger phone in this scenario can be difficult - a problem they said is solved with this thumb extender			2

@entity19 - based @entity30 has released a thumb extender for smartphones
called the @entity22 - which translates as ' finger growth ' - the hollow silicone device helps you reach the entire screen with one hand
this is especially useful for larger phones such as the @entity1
fake digit increases the reach of a thumb or finger by @entity165 ( 0.6 inches )
a black conductor on the tip ensures its touch is registered on the screen
the device retails for £ 8.51 ( $ 13.93 ) and weighs 11 grams ( 0.024 lbs )
