a five - year - old girl 's internal organs and skin began burning from the inside out after suffering a million - to - one toxic reaction to antibiotics she was given for a high temperature			1
@entity7 from @entity8 , @entity9 , was put on a life support machine and doctors said she would not survive after an allergy to penicillin triggered an extremely rare illness			1
she was struck down by @entity15 , @entity15 , which caused severe burns to her kidneys , liver and lungs as well as painful blisters leaving @entity7 without nails , hair or skin			1
@entity7 , five , was put on a life support machine and doctors said she would not survive after an allergy to penicillin triggered an extremely rare illness the disease causes the top layers of skin to detach from the lower layers all over the body , and can lead to multiple - organ failure			1
her mother @entity33 , 44 , said : ' @entity7 just did n't look like herself , it was horrible			1
her skin was falling off and to start with they could n't even bandage her			2
' everything was burning and blistering , inside and out			0
it was just the worst experience of our lives			0
' they told me she would n't survive and she was put on a life support machine			0
three doses of the penicillin overnight very nearly killed my daughter			2
' it started on a saturday and by the time she was taken to a third hospital on the following thursday doctors were saying she was n't going to make it through the night			1
she was treated at @entity53 for three months and will have to be fed through a tube until next year her mother @entity33 ( right ) said : ' @entity7 just did n't look like herself , it was horrible			1
her skin was falling off and to start with they could n't even bandage her ' ' but i never lost my faith throughout			2
at times that is all we had left			0
we prayed so much , and phoned all the local churches to get them to pray for @entity7 too			2
' it did n't matter what they were telling me , i was n't going home without my daughter			0
she is a little miracle			0
' the five - year - old has spent three months in hospital and will have to be fed through a tube until next year			1
@entity7 was prescribed with antibiotics which contained penicillin in may after she went to her gp with a temperature			1
her mother had no idea that @entity7 was allergic to it , so the youngster took the antibiotics without a second thought			2
but by the evening , @entity7 's skin was blistering and her temperature was dangerously high			1
the youngster was rushed to @entity83 of @entity84 , in @entity85 , where a doctor diagnosed @entity15 and told the family that the condition affects less than one - in - a - million			1
ms @entity7 said : ' at one point she stopped breathing and we thought we 'd lost her			2
it was the most horrendous time			0
' but we had to have faith			0
@entity7 's name means ' hope ' and we prayed she would pull through			2
' her mother prayed for her little girl to recover and said she received support from @entity53 chaplain @entity98 ( left ) doctors did not think @entity7 would make it through to the next morning , but her mother kept believing			1
she said : ' i remember @entity7 was barely conscious , but she spoke to me , saying she was ' with @entity102 ' and that he had given her some bread			2
' she told me ' i love you '			0
bread to us signifies healing and from that day on , no matter what anyone said , i knew she would be okay			0
' @entity7 spent three months in @entity53 fighting for her life and her condition has now stabilised			1
but the school girl has been left with 100 per cent burns on her body			1
her mother said : ' all she had was a temperature and the next thing she was fighting for her life			0
' we were told she would n't eat , walk or even see again , but amazingly she pulled through			0
' there is n't a part of @entity7 's body where she has n't been burnt but her skin , hair and nails have all grown back and she is a little fighter			1
' we have to bathe her skin every day and apply creams to her but she is doing well and is over the worst			0
' toxic @entity125 , also know as @entity15 , is a potentially deadly skin disease that usually results from a drug reaction			1
another form of the disease is called @entity130 , and again this usually results from a drug - related reaction			0
both can be deadly as well as very painful and distressing			0
in most cases , these disorders are caused by a reaction to drugs , such as @entity138 and the antibiotic , penicillin			0
this condition can be extremely serious , and can lead to massive discomfort and pain , and in some cases the infection that can be contracted through this disease can result in the death of the patient			0
the most common cause of death in the case of @entity15 is infection , which can be contracted through the exposed areas where the skin has come away from the flesh			1
the skin on patients that have this disease can resemble badly burned skin because of the extent to which it can flay , and exposed areas can seep fluids and become quickly infected .			0
