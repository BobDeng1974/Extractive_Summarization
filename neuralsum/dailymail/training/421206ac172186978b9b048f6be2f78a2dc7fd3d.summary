by @entity0 @entity1 served up a psychological hammer blow to @entity4 team - mate @entity3 with victory in the @entity7 @entity6			1
it was @entity1 's fourth successive win , and the team 's fourth consecutive one - two			1
this race , however , is likely to be one that will hurt @entity3 for some time ahead of @entity15 's blue riband event in @entity16 in a fortnight			2
thumbs up : @entity1 was delighted with his maiden @entity7 @entity6 victory on sunday although @entity1 was clean away from pole , the 29 - year - old grumbled often throughout the race , complaining about oversteer , the back end of the car sliding out , graining on his tyres , his strategy , how much time he had lost to @entity3 in the pit stops			1
at times it was a nervous , tetchy @entity1 behind the wheel , whereas @entity3 appeared to drive serenely behind as he managed the gap to his championship rival			1
to give the @entity33 his shot at victory , @entity4 altered tyre plans from the first stop onwards , and as the race reached its denouement @entity3 reeled @entity1 in			1
@entity40 moment : @entity1 ( centre ) celebrates his fourth consecutive @entity15 win on the podium but despite finally managing to get within a second late on , @entity3 ran out of laps and not once had a crack at making a pass on @entity1 , who ultimately won by just 0.6 seconds			1
it means for the first time since june 2012 @entity1 now leads the drivers ' standings , moving three points ahead of @entity3 who must be wondering what he has to do to triumph again			1
@entity1 also has history on his side because on every one of the 19 previous occasions a driver has won four in a row he has gone on to claim the world championship			2
as wins go , @entity1 's first in @entity7 , this one was crucial as he said : ' it means everything to me			1
getting my first grand prix win here after being in the sport eight years , it 's very difficult to put the feeling into words when you have a result like this			0
' never have i had a car like this , nor a gap like this to anyone before			0
' but i know i was n't fast enough			0
@entity3 was quicker , i struggled with the balance , but fortunately i was able to keep him behind			2
' i really had to rely on my engineers a lot more to give me the gaps and try to find where i could find time , also with my settings as i was moving them up and down , really trying to find extra time			0
' closely - fought : @entity1 ( left ) finished ahead of team - mate @entity3 ( right ) by just 0.6 seconds despite the rivalry between the duo - and there was undoubted tension in the green room before they went on the podium as barely a word was exchanged between them - @entity1 insists they can remain friends			1
' we 've been racing together for a long time , so i do n't see why not , ' remarked @entity1			2
as for @entity3 , he concurred , although his body language perhaps said different as he commented : ' definitely yes , because we 've been through this before			2
' it 's not the first time , and even back then we had discussions , debate , but always ...			0
you discuss it and life goes on			0
' @entity3 is determined @entity1 will not make it five wins in a row in @entity16 , a race the former won from pole last year			1
' second place , i 'm still close in the championship and with many more races to go , ' said @entity3			0
' i 'll be heading to @entity16 where i 'll put in a massive effort to go one better , to repeat the win from last year			0
' massive effort : @entity3 is determined @entity1 will not make it five wins in a row in @entity16 @entity4 ' dominance was such that @entity126 finished 49 seconds adrift in his @entity127 , but at least this was a legitimate podium for the @entity129 who was disqualified from his home race in march			1
as for @entity126 's team - mate @entity132 , the reigning four - times champion conjured his best drive of the season to put behind him a torrid weekend hit by gremlins , finishing fourth after starting 15th			0
@entity140 ' @entity139 was fifth , whilst @entity141 , winners here last year with @entity138 , had to settle for sixth and seventh , with @entity142 passed by the @entity144 just over two laps from home			0
@entity146 hauled @entity147 into the points for the first time in a problematic campaign with eighth , with @entity153 duo @entity152 and @entity155 ninth and 10th			0
that left @entity157 out of the points for the third successive race , with @entity159 and @entity160 11th and 12th , while @entity161 was 19th in his @entity162 .			0

@entity1 secures fourth successive win in @entity7 @entity6
@entity1 leads drivers ' standings for first time since june 2012
@entity3 now trails @entity1 by three points
