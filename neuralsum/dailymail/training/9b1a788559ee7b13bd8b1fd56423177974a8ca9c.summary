by @entity0 for @entity1 it 's no secret that golfing superstar @entity3 has a weakness for women			1
but he has now admitted that his success with the fairer sex is perhaps not down to his natural good looks			0
asked what he would be if he had n't taken up golf , the four - time major winner , 25 , quipped : ' a virgin '			0
the multi-millionaire has revealed that what happened was ' for the best in terms of my golf			0
' but he was recently romantically linked with receptionist @entity18 , who is from @entity34 , @entity35 , a city just the other side of @entity37 from where he grew up			2
prior to that , he was spotted out with model @entity19 , fuelling speculation they were an item			0
pictures taken from outside the hotel showed him cuddling up to one brunette wearing a white bodycon dress.and more recently , @entity3 was last month seen out in @entity49 as he and a friend joined a group of pretty women at the @entity54 hotel at 3am after a saturday night out			2
champion in her own right : @entity3 's former fiancée , the tennis ace @entity21 not a virgin either : @entity3 's quip about his virginity was borrowed from lanky footballer @entity62 , pictured here shortly after marrying lingerie model @entity63 in 2011 @entity3 's latest comment about his relationships with women came as he spoke alongside fellow @entity71 major champions @entity69 and @entity68 for a documentary to be shown on @entity73 tomorrow			1
in a sneak peak seen by @entity75 , he also told how his growing fame forces him to put a ' shield up ' when he is out in public			0
@entity3 's ' virgin ' joke was , of course , not original			1
he was in fact echoing the very same comment given by lanky footballer @entity62 when he was asked what he 'd be if it was n't for his on - pitch success			1
but while @entity85 seems happily settled down with lingerie model wife @entity63 , @entity3 's romantic antics look set to continue for a while at least .			2

golfing ace made the quip while *speaking* in @entity73 documentary
since ditching fiancée @entity21 he 's been linked to several women
the joke was originally borrowed from lanky footballer @entity62
