@entity1 's favourite chocolate bar – the @entity3 bar – is to go @entity4 - free amid growing concerns in the @entity6 about ‘ @entity7 ’			1
the firm has announced that it will no longer use genetically modified sugar beet or soya lecithin in its milk chocolate bars and packs of chocolate drop ‘ kisses ’			2
the issue has come to a head in @entity1 because of efforts to introduce a law requiring firms to label the use of @entity4 ingredients – as happens in @entity22 and @entity23			1
going @entity4 - free : chocolate brand @entity3 is caving into consumer pressure by dropping genetically modified products - including @entity4 sugar beet and soya lecithin - from the recipe of its bars and chocolate drops the @entity32 has voted for @entity4 labelling to come into effect in 2016 and it seems likely to trigger a domino effect with others expected to follow suit			1
once some states require the labelling of @entity4 ingredients like sugar , corn and soya , national food chains will have little option but to adopt the policy across @entity1			1
@entity4 crops like sugar beet , corn or maize and soya have been at the centre of concerns that the associated industrial farming practices have caused serious harm to the environment			1
the plants have been altered through the insertion of foreign genes that create toxins to kill insects or give them immunity to spraying with powerful chemical weed killers			0
there is evidence from the @entity6 that certain weeds have developed immunity to the same weed killers with the result that they are taking over many fields			0
at the same time , the use of sprays alongside the @entity4 crops is thought to have caused a collapse in the population of the monarch butterfly , which is now under threat			2
last year , @entity81 was criticised for selling a number of @entity6 products , including @entity3 bars , @entity86 biscuits , and @entity87 containing @entity4 ingredients			2
the use of @entity4 ingredients has to be included on the labels of the products sold in the @entity22 , however – currently – it is not required on the other side of the @entity94			1
the campaigning group , @entity95 , welcomed the decision by @entity3 as an ‘ important move and great first step ’			2
its campaigns director , @entity99 , said : ‘ as one of the leading chocolate companies in the @entity6 , this commitment will help move the rest of the companies in this sector			0
‘ @entity3 ’s joins @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , and other leading companies in responding to consumer demand to make at least some of its products non- @entity4 ’ the @entity114 group has led a consumer campaign to put pressure on food giants to stop using @entity4 ingredients			1
its co-chairman , @entity118 , said : ’ ‘ @entity3 ’s needs to take the next step and go @entity121 with all of its chocolates , and get third - party verification for @entity121 ingredients			1
’ @entity125 : @entity4 crops like sugar beet , corn or maize and soya have been at the centre of concerns that the associated industrial farming practices have caused serious harm to the environment @entity3 ’s said its change to the products is part of a wider initiative to simplify ingredients used in its products and remove artificial additives			1
for @entity3 and kisses , the company will move to natural vanilla , nongenetically modified sugar and milk from cows that have not been treated with the growth hormone @entity151			0
director of corporate communications , @entity152 , said : ‘ we are looking closely at every ingredient in our products and how we describe them			0
we will strive for simplicity with all of our ingredients , but we may not achieve it with every product			0
‘ we are leading industry conversations with suppliers and building our manufacturing capabilities to pursue non-genetically modified ingredients			0
this is a long - term journey and we are starting with some of our largest and most popular brands			0
‘ the ingredients we are transitioning to @entity168 in both @entity169 and @entity170 are sugar and soy lecithin			0
’ in the @entity6 , @entity3 also intends to roll out ‘ simple snacking products ’ without high fructose corn syrup or artificial colours and flavours , such as @entity176			2
it also plans to introduce a full ingredient glossary and profiles of the firm ’ s suppliers on its website .			0
