by @entity0 and @entity1 climate change could cost the @entity4 hundreds of billions of dollars a year by 2100 , a new bipartisan report has claimed			1
over the next 25 years , annual property losses from hurricanes and other coastal storms are expected to reach $ 35 billion ; a decline in crop yields of 14 percent will cost corn and wheat farmers tens of billions of dollars a year and heat wave - driven demand for electricity is forecast to cost utility customers up to $ 12 billion annually			1
but the report , commissioned by a group chaired by former @entity19 mayor @entity18 , former secretary of the treasury and @entity22 alum @entity21 , and environmentalist and financier @entity24 , claims the price tag could soar to hundreds of billions by 2100			0
hurricanes on the rise : this november 15 , 2012 photo shows a house in @entity30 that was destroyed by @entity31			0
over the next 25 years , annual property losses from hurricanes and other coastal storms alone are expected to reach $ 35 billion , a new report claims the analysis , released tuesday , ' is the most detailed ever of the potential economic effects of climate change on the @entity4 , ' climatologist @entity34 of @entity35 said			1
it comes three weeks after president @entity40 ordered @entity4 regulators to take their strongest steps ever to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , including requiring power plants to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030			0
called ' @entity48 , ' the report projects climate impacts at scales as small as individual counties			0
its conclusions about crop losses and other consequences are based not on computer projections , which climate - change skeptics routinely attack , but on data from past heat waves			1
it paints a grim picture of economic loss			0
' our economy is vulnerable to an overwhelming number of risks from climate change , ' @entity21 said in a statement , including from sea - level rise and from heat waves that will cause deaths , reduce labor productivity and strain power grids			1
by mid-century , $ 66 billion to $ 106 billion worth of coastal property will likely be below sea level			2
act now : on june 14 , 2014 , president @entity40 told a graduating class at the @entity77 that denying climate change is like arguing the moon is made of cheese , and issued a call to action on global warming there is a 5 percent chance that by 2100 the losses will reach $ 700 billion , with average annual losses from rising oceans of $ 42 billion to $ 108 billion along the @entity88 and @entity89			1
extreme heat , especially in the @entity91 , @entity92 and upper @entity93 , will slash labor productivity as people are unable to work outdoors at construction and other jobs for sustained periods			0
the analysis goes further than previous work , said @entity35 's @entity101 , by identifying places that will be ' unsuited for outdoor activity			0
' demand for electricity will surge as people need air conditioning just to survive , straining generation and transmission capacity			0
that will likely require the construction of up to 95 gigawatts of generation capacity over the next 5 to 25 years , or roughly 200 average - size coal or natural gas power plants			2
as utilities add the construction costs to customers ' bills , people and businesses will pay $ 8.5 billion to $ 30 billion more every year by the middle of the century			2
the report does not make policy prescriptions , concluding only that ' it is time for all @entity4 business leaders and investors to get in the game and rise to the challenge of addressing climate change			1

the bipartisan report , released today , has been *dubbed* ' the most detailed ever ' on the potential economic effects of climate change on the @entity4
claims in just 25 years annual property losses from hurricanes and other coastal storms will reach $ 35 billion
a decline in crop yields of 14 percent will cost corn and wheat farmers tens of billions of dollars a year
and heat wave - driven demand for electricity is forecast to cost utility customers up to $ 12 billion annually
its conclusions about crop losses and other consequences are based not on computer projections , but on data from past heat waves
