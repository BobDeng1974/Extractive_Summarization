by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 edged closer to financial meltdown on friday after former director @entity4 succeeded in freezing £ 620,000 of the club ’s cash			1
in a hearing at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 ruled in @entity4 ’ s favour despite learning the stricken club have just £ 1.2million left in the bank and could soon be insolvent			1
rangers have vowed to appeal the verdict and will return to the court on tuesday after a claim the club ’s finances were the ‘ envy of many @entity22 sides ’ was rejected			1
money : former @entity2 commercial director @entity4 has taken the club to court to try and freeze £ 620,000 of the @entity28 club 's assets @entity29 needed : @entity2 will hope the @entity31 giants can gain promotion from the @entity33 back on the brink : if the shares issues fails to reach at least £ 3m then @entity2 ' future could be uncertain again a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ further to the @entity39 announcement regarding the court action taken by @entity4 against @entity2 , whatever the outcome of the court process , we agree with judge @entity10 when he told the court : “ this does not mean to say that insolvency is an actuality or is going to happen ”			1
‘ we remain confident that the @entity48 will be able to continue to operate as normal			0
’ but directors desperately need the forthcoming £ 4m ‘ open ’ share offer to be fully subscribed to enable them to pay player and staff wages , which fall due on the last thursday of this month			2
on top of that , they still owe £ 1.5m in loans to @entity57 and @entity58 , debts that were originally due to have been paid off by the end of august			2
lawyers for @entity4 argued he is owed a £ 500,000 bonus , plus £ 120,000 in legal costs , for the time he spent working at @entity2 and went to court amid concerns the club will have no cash to pay him if he wins his claim in november			1
@entity4 , who left the @entity28 side in april 2013 , maintains he is entitled to five per cent of commercial contracts negotiated by him subject to written approval from the chief executive			1
he previously contended that a letter from then chief executive @entity75 had confirmed that his bonus for 2013 would be ‘ no less than £ 500,000 ’			1
friday was the third time the former @entity79 executive had tried to ring - fence the amount			2
disgraced : @entity82 put @entity2 into administration in 2012 when he was in charge of the club despite expressing sympathy for an increasingly concerned @entity2 support , lord @entity10 decided there was a ‘ risk ’ of the @entity31 side suffering an insolvency event and ordered that the money be set aside immediately			2
‘ i have a great deal of sympathy for @entity2 fans who are bystanders in these events , ’ said @entity10			0
‘ i have formed the view that there is a risk of @entity2 becoming insolvent			0
‘ that is not to say there is an actuality or a certainty that insolvency is something that will happen			0
at this stage , it is only a risk			0
’ the £ 4m share issue announced last friday is designed to meet the club ’s short - term needs and will cover the wage bill if investors respond			1
but @entity2 seem likely now to bring forward an egm designed to seek permission for a larger scale share issue which could allow prospective investors @entity117 or @entity119 to plough much - needed funds into the club			2
rangers advocate @entity123 claimed on friday that the club were in ‘ advanced ’ discussions with two unnamed prospective investors but failed to convince the judge @entity2 ’ finances were really improving			1
he said : ‘ when we were last here , we heard how the share issue would only keep the lights on at @entity28			1
i can tell you that the floodlights are back on at @entity28 and are in no danger of being switched off			2
‘ the most turbulent financial period in history is now in the past and the club is moving upwards towards profitability			0
‘ talks are at an advanced stage with two potential investors			0
the club has not been in rude health for some time but the situation is improving			2
the club is trading its way out of difficulties			0
it ’s current position is the envy of many @entity22 clubs			0
‘ it is moving upwards through the leagues			0
the plan is for it to return into the @entity157 and into the promised land of @entity160 competition where there is big money to be made through gate money , television rights and the like			0
’ happier times : @entity166 and @entity167 celebrate wining the @entity168 in 1996 @entity2 chief executive @entity169 also provided a statement to the court claiming the club was in good financial health and would continue to grow			2
but @entity4 ’s legal representative told the court that there was no proof the forthcoming share issue or the season ticket sales could keep the club solvent and that there was no guarantee that investors would come forward to save the side			1
advocate @entity185 added : ‘ a pattern of diminishing working capital is evident			0
there is no concrete saviour for @entity2			0
’ lord @entity10 fixed a hearing at the @entity8 for @entity2 to appeal on tuesday and on friday night a @entity2 statement read : ‘ @entity192 confirms that the @entity8 in @entity9 has granted a request by mr @entity4 for an order allowing him to arrest £ 620,000 in a @entity2 bank account or the accounts of others who may be due to pay sums to @entity2			1
‘ he sought this order in connection with a claim against the @entity203 for alleged unpaid bonuses in the amount of £ 500,000			1
the court granted permission to arrest £ 620,000 to take account of the sum sued for and mr @entity4 ’s legal expenses in connection with his claim			1
‘ leave to appeal this decision has been sought by @entity2 and the court will deal with that request on tuesday			0
‘ this is a provisional procedural measure and the fact that this procedural ruling is in mr @entity4 ’s favour it is in not an indication that the court accepts there is any merit in his claim			1
the court has not yet considered the merits of mr @entity4 ’s claim			1
mr @entity4 ’s claim is being robustly defended			1
‘ the case proceeds to a full hearing on its merits commencing 11 november 2014			0
if the defence of this claim is successful the funds arrested will be released			0
’ concern : @entity166 is worried about the club 's perilous finances and the prospect of administration @entity2 precarious financial position was brought in to sharp focus last week when the embattled club issued a statement to the @entity39 saying it had to find an injection of funding or ‘ the company will be unable to pay its creditors as they fall due and the future of the company will be uncertain			1
’ the statement added : ‘ the directors will immediately have to seek emergency financing which may or may not be available			0
’ there then followed revelations that that name rights for @entity28 had been sold to @entity255 owner @entity117 for £ 1 in a deal with @entity75 last year			1
and , in a newspaper interview this week , @entity2 director @entity257 alluded to the increasingly fraught financial situation at the club			2
asked about the ‘ level of anxiety growing among fans ’ , @entity257 said : ‘ yes i do feel it			0
it ’s realistic because the club must raise funds to go forward			0
if we do n’t then we ’ll have to look at cutting the expenditure even more			0
