by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell for @entity2 this victory was a 49 - minute stroll that quite probably acted as a timely warm down from the doubles match she only finished with her sister 15 hours earlier			1
the five - time champion swatted aside @entity9 , a 30 - year - old @entity10 who had only won once at @entity12 in five attempts , 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 , exhausting about as much energy as she would on the practise grounds of @entity16			1
she and @entity17 had completed their three - set first - round win at 8.59pm on wednesday night but opening up on @entity20 at 1pm was no trouble			1
no sweat : @entity2 celebrates after beating her opponent in just 49 minutes on the charge : @entity2 crushed @entity9 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 on thursday no answers : @entity9 could not live with the power of @entity2 @entity2 bore her familiar early - round demeanour throughout , the one where it seems as if casting aside lesser players is a minor chore she could do without			1
but the 32 - year - old brought her game too , slapping a cross-court return with venom to break her opponent ’s first service game			2
there were aces of 112mph and 115mph too			2
during her match with @entity17 she tumbled into the crowd , but there was never going to be any slips here			0
‘ i was out really late in a super fun doubles match , ’ she said			0
‘ some wonderful gents caught me as i dove in the crowd			0
it was so embarrassing i had to laugh about it			0
’ @entity52 is up next in round three			2
on this form , you suspect there will be little humour for the 25th seed from @entity59 .			0
