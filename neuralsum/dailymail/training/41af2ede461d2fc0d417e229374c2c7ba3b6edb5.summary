fastfood giant @entity0 has suspended a member of staff who claimed an order was laced with pubic hair			1
the worker at the restaurant in @entity7 , @entity8 , said the alleged move was an act of revenge after customers told her friend to ' smile more '			1
however , bosses claim it could not have happened because there were four other people in the kitchen - ' which is pretty cosy '			2
a worker at @entity0 in @entity21 , @entity8 has been suspended after claiming order was laced with pubic hair details of the alleged incident were published in an anonymous post on the ' @entity29 ' @entity28 page , designed as an outlet for ' rants ' about the @entity33 capital			1
the staff member wrote that the victims of the prank , a group of girls , drove through @entity0 between 1pm and 1.30pm yesterday			2
the post said : ' karma 's a * * * * girls , hope you enjoyed your food i made for you after overhearing the way you spoke to my girl on the head set be picking pubes out your teeth for a week ' ( sic )			2
it was then signed off with ' mwah ' , a word used to express the sound of a kiss			0
however , a spokesman for @entity0 said the worker - who is suspended indefinitely - has now admitted it did n't happen after being interviewed by the ' area coach '			1
the spokesman conceded that there was an ' altercation ' at the drive - thru but maintain that no food was contaminated - adding that two other workers have since been interviewed and insist it could not be true			0
' we were already pretty confident that it did n't happen			1
the post was put up and then everyone that was there was interviewed by the area coach , ' she said			0
' it takes a few people to make a meal and the other workers say there is no way she could have done it			0
' two other people are pretty confident that it did n't happen			1
the message , which was posted on facebook page @entity8 , suggested the worker had carried out the alleged act in an apparent revenge attack for rudeness - but @entity0 now claims she made it up ' she has admitted it was a spur of the moment prank to draw attention to the people that were being rude			1
' the chain said in a statement : ' we have thoroughly investigated this incident and can confirm that the content of the post is untrue and that the food was not contaminated in any way			0
' it was a badly misjudged and regrettable social media prank and we 'd like to reassure customers that the incident did not happen			2
' earlier today the spokesman said : ' we have investigated this incident and although there was an altercation in the drive - thru between the customers and a member of our team , we do not believe the food was contaminated in any way			0
' we have the highest standards of food hygiene and do not tolerate even the suggestion of this kind of behaviour , and therefore the employee was suspended as soon as the matter came to our attention			0
' the @entity29 page was set up as an outlet for anonymous posts .			0

@entity0 said it could not have happened because kitchens are too small
