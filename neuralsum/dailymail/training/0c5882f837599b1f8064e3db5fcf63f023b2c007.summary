' someone is not doing what is ordinarily done			0
there is an abuse of power			0
' @entity3 is the sole carer of her elderly mother - in - law , another @entity12 citizen , whose toes were amputated and needs help eating , walking and washing			1
but her case for political asylum was rejected after a judge said her testimony about fearing the prostitution trade and criminal activity in @entity10 lacked credibility			2

an estimated 500,000 people are living in the @entity12 with a deportation order , however , @entity12 @entity52 and @entity53 only acts on a portion of cases and the @entity180 specifically said targeting people with criminal convictions was the priority			2

' @entity6 has gone off the map here , ' @entity130 said before the case review was announced			2

but the mother - of - three was convinced @entity87 would n't deport a woman whose three kids are @entity12 - born			1
' that is strange they put an ankle bracelet on a mom with three kids , ' @entity130 said , referring to the low risk of her fleeing			0
' then the day before her scheduled flight they said " you 're flying out tomorrow , here 's your information			1
" they did n't want the bad press			0
' i think they wanted it to look as natural as possible because they understood how egregious this case is			0
it just does n't make sense			0
' if officials did not decide to review her case , the authorities would have been forced to collect @entity3 from her home yesterday and take her into custody			1

hugs : @entity3 has not decided , if she is in fact deported , whether to take the kids , who have never been to @entity10 , with her review : the mother 's case will be reviewed ' they will jail her for one to three weeks , however long it takes to organize another flight , ' @entity130 told @entity135 of the process			1
' then border guards will drive her to the airport and take off her ankle bracelet like she 's a mass murderer or a terrorist going to @entity282			0
' @entity130 and the family were working desperately for someone in @entity285 to interject			0
' we need somebody in the @entity288 , connected to @entity87 , to say " stop this immediately			0
" if someone in @entity285 hears about this , that is our best chance			0
her story just has n't been heard			0
' understandably , @entity3 was beside herself , and was still trying to work out if she would take her children , who are enrolled in school and have never been to @entity10 , with her			1

' she is an emotional mess , ' @entity130 explained			0
deportation : @entity3 was informed monday that she had to report at @entity310 's @entity309 terminal at 10:30 a.m. tuesday as per the above order empty : but the terminal , pictured , was empty at 10:30 a.m. tuesday , as the mother - of - three defied the order by staying home ' what she has been told by numerous people was that they do n't deport women with three @entity12 citizen children and that is exactly what they 're doing			1
' she is crying all the time , trying to work out who she can take and who she ca n't			1
she 's going back to @entity10 and that is not a good place to bring a 6 - year - old girl , particularly			1
' he added : ' it happened in one day , she has no idea what to do			0
' @entity79 told the @entity58 monday night the family was ' hoping for a miracle			2
' ' the basis of this request is that ms. @entity30 would like to remain in the @entity12 to care for her three children			2
after weighing the factors as related to @entity337 , i have determined that the stay of removal will be granted for a period of one year , ' read the letter @entity3 received yesterday from the @entity343 and @entity52 office .			1

@entity3 , 41 , of @entity6 , @entity345 , was told yesterday she has been granted a stay of removal for another year

she had been ordered to report for deportation at @entity48 at 10:30 a.m. tuesday for a flight back to @entity10
she received a letter from authorities informing her of her deportation on monday , a day before her scheduled flight
in a desperate bid to *buy* time , she *deliberately* missed her flight , instead staying at home with her family around her
she expected to be taken to jail as the authorities organize another flight before she got the good news , though her *future* still is n't certain
her husband has lived in the @entity12 for 40 years and her three children , aged 11 , six and four , are @entity12 citizens enrolled in the local school
she is also the sole carer for her elderly mother - in - law who ca n't eat or walk on her own
