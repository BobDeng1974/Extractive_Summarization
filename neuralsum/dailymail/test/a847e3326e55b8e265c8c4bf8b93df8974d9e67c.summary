@entity1 boss @entity0 says he is already working on a dossier of signing targets for next season - even though he may not be around to parade them			1
the interim @entity7 manager still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the current campaign after being lured back to his old club to kick - start their faltering promotion bid			2
so far , everything is going to plan with @entity14 second in the @entity16 table and destined for a semi-final play - off slot			1
@entity0 says he is already looking at transfer targets for next season , though he may not be at @entity1 but with 12 players out of contract , @entity0 knows the @entity22 will need to strengthen if they have any chance of keeping pace with rivals @entity25 next season - if they go up - and is already piecing together a wish list of potential new arrivals			1
he said : ' i 've been speaking to a lot of agents and putting things in place for if and when ... even if i 'm not here , if i 'm getting players put to me who would like to come to @entity1 regardless of the manager , then we build a little portfolio of positions that we will be needing next year			1
' it 's not a case of us standing still and then thinking come june 1 , ' oh we need to get into action '			2
' no , there are a lot of agents who come to us and we build a little dossier of players that as a staff , we think will be good for next season , regardless of what league we are in			2
' it would be slightly naive [ if we were not doing that ]			0
if i 'm in charge or not , i still want the club to do well and i will put my view across to the board on who i think should be coming into the club and who should be here			2
' @entity0 is compiling a dossier on targets as he looks to put the club in the best possible position rangers have operated a haphazard transfer policy since re-emerging from the embers of liquidation			1
the club 's team of scouts were jettisoned under the disastrous @entity71 regime and former boss @entity72 was largely forced to turn to a list of former @entity7 servants he had personal knowledge of when trying to bolster his squad			1
but @entity0 revealed the club 's new board are now starting the process of re-establishing their spying network - albeit on a smaller level than before			1
' i think there has been discussions behind the scenes with different people , ' said the former @entity89 boss			2
' i do n't think we are at the stage where we were 10 or 15 years ago where we were aiming to get into the @entity92 and bringing players in for three and four million yet			0
' i do n't think @entity1 will be at the stage yet next year where we need international scouts everywhere			1
rangers have expanded their scouting network after a haphazard system over the past few years ' but certainly a scouting network needs to be put in place			1
' having said that , i spoke to @entity101 at @entity102 and they do a lot of their scouting with [ online service ] @entity107			0
when i brought @entity110 in at @entity89 , that was after i 'd seen a clip of him on @entity112			0
i sold him for Â£ 350,000 after signing him for nothing			0
' so you can still do your own background work			0
personally i would always like to see the player myself			0
i 've only ever signed one player without watching him first and slightly regretted it			0
' so yeah we need a scouting network but at this moment where @entity1 are , not to the extent where we have scouts all over @entity126			1
' @entity0 admitted he still does not know if he will rejoin @entity129 's @entity128 staff for the june 13 @entity131 qualifier with @entity132 in @entity133			2
and he also confessed to uncertainties ahead of saturday 's match with @entity136			0
@entity0 's side are still in line for promotion , sitting in the play - off positions in the @entity16 @entity143 's @entity142 - five points behind fourth - placed @entity144 with two games to play - need an unlikely series of results to make the play - offs but @entity0 says that raises more questions than answers			1
he said : ' @entity152 is a wily old fox who has done terrifically well in his career so i do n't know what to expect			0
' it will take a difficult set of results for them to get into the play - offs so i do n't know if they will come here and think the pressure is off and play care free			1
' they do n't lose many goals so we may have to be patient through the 90 minutes			0
we have had a couple of decent results against them but they have capable players and we will need to be at our best			0

rangers are currently second in the @entity16
@entity0 's side are in pole position to go up via the play - offs
but @entity0 is still not certain of his future at the club next season
@entity1 boss says he is still trying to build the squad for next year
rangers have begun to expand their scouting after several poor years
