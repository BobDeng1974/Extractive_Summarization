by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 has given the 2014 @entity2 a massive boost by announcing he is ‘ available for selection ’ , albeit only in the 4x100metres relay			1
the world and @entity8 100m and 200m champion has yet to compete this season after suffering a foot injury and will miss this weekend ’s @entity12 , but has said he is ‘ available for relay duty ’ in @entity13			1
crowds at @entity16 , however , will still see @entity1 in action for less than 20 seconds if he runs in the heats and final at the @entity2 : the 100m world record - holder was clocked at 8.70secs for the anchor leg of @entity22 ’s sprint relay triumph at the @entity23			1
the early cut - off time for qualification meant @entity39 ’s current fastest male 100m runner , @entity38 , missed out on selection as he did not run 9.96secs in @entity42 , @entity43 until june 8			1
the oversight means @entity38 will instead concentrate on guaranteeing his place in @entity39 ’s team for august ’s @entity47 in @entity48 by finishing in the top two at this weekend ’s @entity51 ’s @entity50 in @entity52			1
the 20 - year - old ’s coach , @entity53 , believes @entity38 is capable of dipping under 9.9secs this season , putting him on course to break @entity59 ’s @entity58 record of 9.87secs , and could also win his first senior medal in @entity48			1
cohorts : @entity1 celebrates with team - mate @entity32 following the 200 - metre final during @entity23 unavailable : @entity32 wo n't compete in the @entity2 for @entity22 @entity53 said : ‘ i would expect him to get faster			1
with the same conditions as @entity42 , can he run 9.8secs ? i do n’t see why not			2
and can he go to @entity66 and challenge for a medal ? for sure			2
‘ this is the greatest @entity58 sprinting has ever been			2
now we ’ve not only got 9.9sec guys , but a plethora of other guys who have all run 10.1 this year			0
’ @entity53 said @entity38 was so ‘ technically bad it was scary ’ when he first met him four years ago , but the youngster is now bidding to become @entity58 100m champion tomorrow afternoon in @entity52			0
@entity38 , the third fastest @entity58 man in history , said : ‘ i do n’t believe i ’m a one - hit wonder			0
i believe that if i execute my race on sunday and the conditions are good i ’ll run a fast time			0
every race i go into i ’ll definitely aim to win it			0
‘ i still feel there is a lot more to be done and a lot more to achieve			0
it is definitely good being the fastest in the @entity58 right now , but you then have to go out and prove you can do it at a world level			0
’ @entity89 : live sunday , @entity90 from 1pm and @entity91 from 2pm .			0

@entity1 confirmed on his *website* that he is available for selection
@entity22 was a major doubt after suffering from foot injury
participation may be limited to the relay , *depending* on selectors ' stance
