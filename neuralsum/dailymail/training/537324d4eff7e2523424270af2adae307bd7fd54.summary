this eerie ghost - like figure left a group of trekkers stunned when it suddenly appeared over a mountain range , but it was nothing more than the rare natural phenomenon known as a @entity8			1
@entity11 photographer , @entity9 was part of the trekking group which came across the unusual spectacle at @entity16 mountain region , in @entity17 , @entity18			1
like with a rainbow , this is caused by light refracting through tiny droplets of water in the air			2
the phenomenon of refraction , as illustrated on @entity51 's @entity53 album cover ( above ) , occurs when light rays are bent as they pass through different transparent materials - in this case water and air			1
when a beam crosses between the two materials the wavelength of the light changes			2
as light is made up of several colors , when it is refracted these colors can bend at different amounts and become individually visible			2
the @entity51 cover shows a triangular glass prism with a beam of light moving through the two sides causing the different colors to bend and break out in a rainbow			2
water in the air acts as tiny prisms so when light enters the raindrop , it reflects off the sides of the drop and is broken into a spectrum			0
another example of refraction would be a drinking straw in glass of water			0
when viewed from the side the straw appears to be broken at the point it enters the water due to the difference in the densities of water and air			0
the stunning illusions are created when a low sun shines behind someone looking down into fog from a ridge			1
the heads of the figures are often surrounded by rings of coloured light , an effect caused by the diffraction of visible light			1
to add to the frightening effect , the ghostly figures can sometimes appear to move , often very suddenly , due to the drifting of the clouds			1
photographer @entity9 , 61 , a university chemistry lecturer , trekked up to 1,200 metres above the cloud levels to get a glimpse of the phenomenon			0
he said : ' i love being out taking pictures and even when it gets down to some freezing temperatures around -15 degrees i 'm still out climbing the mountains looking for the perfect image			0
' as a scientist , i know the physics behind why this shape happens but because that day i saw this a few times it was as if i was being chased by a ghost			0
' the beginning of the day was so cloudy that i just presumed that i would n't be able to capture anything			0
' we were tempted to turn back at 900 metres because it was so cloudy but i 'm really glad we persevered and carried on heading up as at around 1,200 metres the fog started to clear otherwise i 'd never have been able to see this			0
' the @entity8 spectre got its name because of early sightings on the @entity8 , the highest peak of @entity138 's @entity137			1
it can appear on any misty mountainside or cloud bank , or even on some occasions , from an aeroplane so long as the conditions are right			0
although it may look like the arrival of a spook this is in fact an example of the @entity8 phenomenon the extraordinary sight is created by the light behind a climber casting their shadow often in an odd triangular shape the heads of the figures are often surrounded by rings of coloured light , an effect caused by the diffraction of visible light amazingly , the ghostly figures can sometimes appear to move rapidly when the cloud layer moves or there are variations in its density			1
@entity138 scientist @entity169 first observed the phenomenon in 1780 but since then they have been seen and recorded many times in the region			0
the extraordinary sight involves the light behind a climber casting their shadow often in an odd triangular shape			2
the shadow can also fall on water droplets of varying differences from the observer 's eye causing confused depth perception			2
the clever illusions are created when low sun shines behind someone looking down into fog from a ridge photographer @entity9 was part of a trekking group who were left stunned when they came across the unusual spectacle at @entity16 mountain region , in @entity17 , @entity18 among mountain climbers though there is a superstition that whoever sees a @entity8 will die in the mountains the very next day			1
the team also headed up @entity202 and @entity203 mountains in search of a sighting			0
the region is famous for the stunning landscapes and breath - taking wonders which attract people from all over the world .			1

@entity8 is actually a person 's shadow cast onto low - lying clouds
light diffraction causes figures to be surrounded by a multi-coloured ' halo '
stunning examples photographed in @entity18 's @entity16 mountain region
according to climbers ' superstition , whoever sees one will die the next day
