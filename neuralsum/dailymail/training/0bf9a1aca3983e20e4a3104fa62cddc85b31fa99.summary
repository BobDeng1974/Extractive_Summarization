her hesitant calf watched closely as she wallowed in the mud and eventually submerged her whole body			2
wildlife photographer @entity12 was thrilled to capture the tender moment at the @entity15 reserve in @entity7 the calf is less enthusiastic than his mother at first , looking on as she rolls in the mud the pair splash and roll in the mud , covering themselves in the brown sludge the playful youngster finally followed its mother but managed to get mud in its ears			1
completely covered , the pair then rushed to the middle of the pond to shake off the mud and bathe in the water			1
wildlife photographer @entity12 , from @entity31 , @entity7 , travelled to the @entity15 reserve in @entity7 to capture the moment			1
the 41 - year - old said : ' i set up a hide near a wallowing pool and waited for the deer to arrive			2
' it is a popular place for the deer and several visit throughout the day			0
after a few hours two eventually arrived			0
' the mother immediately began to kick the water to make sure there are no hidden objects before laying down			2
the calf tries to shake the mud out of it 's ear following the wallow in the mud completely coated in mud , the pair begin to wade into the water shaking off the mud , the two deer were captured playing together for several minutes before returning to the wood the deer seemed to find their playtime blissful as they languished in the water the deer shake out the mud that has manged to get into their ears ' her calf seemed more reluctant to go into the mud and at first watched the mum roll around covering herself with mud			1
