by @entity0 the @entity1 has been accused of anti-government bias after a documentary on police spending cuts failed to mention big reductions in recorded crime			1
the @entity1 documentary @entity7 painted a bleak picture of policing in @entity10 , with over-stretched officers struggling to cope with a rising tide of anti-social behaviour			1
the producers of the programme , which was screened last week , posed the question : ‘ with cuts biting ever deeper , is it time to accept that there are certain things the police just ca n’t afford to do ? ’ negative view : the @entity1 documentary @entity7 , which features @entity24 , pcso @entity25 , painted a bleak picture of policing in @entity10 but senior @entity29 pointed out that the hour - long programme made no mention of the fact that crime has fallen since 2010 , both nationally and in @entity34 , where recorded crime has dropped by 16 per cent			1
the programme also failed to give any broader explanation of why police budgets have had to be cut as part of the @entity41 ’s drive to tackle the huge budget deficit left behind by @entity43			1
it was made by the production firm @entity45 , whose founder @entity46 has close links to the @entity49 , which is playing a key role in generating ideas for @entity43 ’s next manifesto			0
@entity54 mp @entity53 said : ‘ it is very disappointing to see the @entity1 once again producing programmes that are distorted and lacking in any balance			1
' we all know the police have had to take their fair share of cuts following @entity43 ’s great recession , but at the same time they have cut crime by 16 per cent and many front line police jobs have been protected by @entity65			1
critique : there was no mention of the fact that crime has fallen since 2010 , both nationally and in @entity34 , during the hour - long documentary , @entity54 mp @entity53 said ‘ it looks like the bias may be down to the fact that the production company has very close links to @entity43 ’s favourite think tank the @entity49			1
' all the same , the @entity1 should know better and certainly it is out of keeping with one of its fundamental founding principles to be impartial			2
’ fellow @entity54 @entity83 , a member of the @entity84 , said there was no place for such ‘ one - sided ’ documentaries on the @entity1			2
critique : conservative mp @entity53 accused the documentary of being ' distorted and lacking in any balance ' mr @entity83 said : ‘ i do n’t particularly support cuts to the police budget myself , and i have voted against them			2
but the @entity1 has a fundamental duty to be impartial and balanced			2
it is unacceptable for it to be putting out one - sided , biased programmes			0
‘ i have no problem with them making a programme about police cuts , but they have to also explain why this government is having to make these cuts to public spending and they should explain what has happened to crime			2
’ the documentary chronicled community tensions in east @entity10 following a big influx of @entity111 immigrants from @entity112			1
the presenter said the police were ‘ under pressure like never before ’ , and said that in @entity34 ‘ the entire neighbourhood policing budget is now under review ’			0
the entire programme is viewed through the prism of real term budget cuts totalling 11.5 per cent , which have resulted in a seven per cent reduction in officer numbers in @entity34			0
the presenter says parts of @entity10 have been ‘ starved ’ of police patrols , and warns that a senior commander ‘ just does n’t have the officers ’ to cope with the scale of the challenge			1
the documentary showed some police officers complaining about the impact of cutbacks			0
but officers were also recorded complaining that the main issue holding them back was a lack of legal powers to deal with behaviour by @entity111 behaviour that angered other members of the local community , but which fell short of the legal definition of anti-social behaviour			0
the @entity1 last night defended the broadcast , which was watched by more than a million people			0
a spokesman said the second part of the documentary , which was due to be screened last night , did mention the national crime fall			1
’ the spokesman added : ‘ we are confident that these observational films following the work of @entity154 adhere to our editorial guidelines and we have received only two complaints from an audience of 1.2 million			0
‘ @entity46 has an excellent reputation for producing high quality documentaries			0
he has had very limited contact with the @entity49 and has had no involvement with their crime and justice policy work			0
