tv detective : @entity1 , pictured filming @entity2 in @entity3 , was sent hate mail after appearing in a documentary about the occupation of the island @entity2 star @entity1 seemed the perfect choice to present a documentary on the history of @entity3 after spending many years filming scenes for the hit tv series on the idyllic island			1
but the actor , who is still well remembered for playing the tv detective for a decade from 1981 , has revealed how he was outcast by his friends for being involved in the three - part expose about the @entity19 occupation of @entity3 during the @entity20			1
at the time @entity1 had no idea that the show would receive such a hostile reception from the islanders and thought it would be an interesting chance to learn more about the island he had spent so much time in			2
but shortly after the show was aired he found himself being ostracised by former friends on the island and the recipient of threatening letters and hate mail			1
he told the @entity34 : ' the islanders did n't like the way we talked about the resistance , did n't like the way we talked about the collaboration or allegations of it and they did n't like the way we talked about the treatment of the @entity44 by the administration of the islands			0
' despite the animosity caused by the @entity50 documentary , it inspired @entity1 to continue researching the subject and he is now releasing a book that goes into the @entity19 occupation of @entity3 in more detail			1
@entity1 , now 69 , knew that many would be unhappy about the project , but decided the story needed to be told			0
reminders of the occupation , such as this @entity66 fortification , can still be seen on @entity3 sensitive subject : this @entity66 underground hospital in @entity3 is just one of many historical landmarks that demonstrate the strength of the occupying force on the island he said : ' there came a point when i thought , either i do n't tell this story and keep my friends or i tell it and lose them all			2
' the @entity62 - comprising of @entity3 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 - were the only part of @entity85 ever to fall under @entity19 rule during the @entity20			2
@entity61 felt the islands were impossible to defend and many residents were forced to flee to mainland @entity85			0
those who remained were left to fend for themselves under a strict @entity66 regime with @entity3 occupied from july 1 , 1940 , until may 9 , 1945			0
many were left completely isolated with limited rations and no way of escape			0
invaders : @entity66 soldiers with a 25 - ton @entity99 tank used during the occupation of @entity3 in the @entity20 @entity1 said : ' it is the story of a sustained and wholesale attack on human values , of great suffering , venality and violence			1
' but some islanders fared better than others during the occupation with @entity1 noting that the @entity110 , @entity111 , invited invading @entity66 officers to a lobster dinner			0
this was one of many examples later investigated by the @entity85 government as possible collaboration with the @entity119			0
@entity1 points out that many were left with little choice but to obey the @entity19 occupiers as they had no way of escaping and hardly any weapons			2
backlash : @entity1 said he received hate mail over his claims in the tv documentary @entity128 but their co-operation in producing a list of residents and details of their birth aided the @entity66 in identifying @entity44 residents who were then transported to concentration camps			1
@entity1 added : ' the @entity44 question in the @entity62 is one of the most difficult to address			0
people are deeply , deeply hurt by accusations that they are anti-semitic , or that they were too much inclined to load the @entity44 on to the transporters			0
' although @entity1 also highlights heroic acts of bravery where residents helped to hide @entity44 friends and escaped @entity146 and save them from the @entity19 death camps			2
