but then i was suddenly taken home			0
‘ i was used as a domestic slave and beaten if i did n't do what i was told			0

’ @entity2 , whose family lived in @entity28 , told her school what was happening and a social worker was sent to her home			1
at the age of just 13 @entity2 was taken from @entity3 to @entity4 and made to marry a man more than twice her age but a family member , who beat her nearly unconscious for alerting the authorities , brought the family to @entity3 in a bid to escape suspicion			1
@entity2 's family settled in @entity41 and , although her brothers went to school , she was kept at home and forced to cook and clean			1
when she was 13 @entity2 was told she and a family member were going on holiday to @entity4			1
the 44 - year - old said : ‘ i was told i was going on holiday and i was really excited , at the children 's home we used to go the beach and it was great fun , so i assumed the holiday would be like that			1
‘ but when we got to @entity4 i was introduced to two guys and told , “ of these two guys , which one do you like best ? ” ‘ one was chosen - he was much older than me , in his late 20s - and i was married to him in a very quick ceremony			1
’ @entity2 said she had no idea what was happening and she was told she would be allowed to return to @entity15 only if she was pregnant			1

‘ eventually i became pregnant and , at two months gone , we came back to @entity3			1
’ @entity2 's new husband wanted to move to the @entity64 and it was thought having a @entity64 - born child would help his visa application			1
back in @entity3 the teenager attended gp visits and saw a midwife throughout her pregnancy , but medical staff had no suspicions that anything was wrong			1
she said : ‘ i made all my gp visits , i saw a midwife			0
if one person had asked me if i was okay then i would have told everything , but my family constantly told me to be quiet and i was slapped if i spoke up so there was no way i could tell anyone without being asked first			2

‘ one day i was taken to a solicitor to sign papers to have my husband in @entity4 come to @entity15			2
i did n't want to see him again and i did n't want him to come here			0
‘ it was a tipping point and the family friend said he was leaving - and would i come with him ? ‘ so we left and i moved into a homeless hostel in @entity104			1
’ her brother was furious that she had , in his eyes , disgraced the family , and hired four hit men to find her			1
he paid them £ 50 each to carry out the job			0
councillor @entity86 and @entity2 hope that hearing @entity2 's story will help others in similar situations come forward @entity2 said : ‘ that 's what my life was worth			1
i was terrified because i knew what my brother was capable of			0
‘ i had disgraced the family honour and it is the culture that honour must be restored by the head of the family			0
’ the first @entity2 knew of the attempt on her life was when police arrived at her house			2
officers had been tipped off and arrested the men , who were found to have baseball bats and nunchucks in the boot of their car			0
they , and her brother , were imprisoned			0
the family friend who rescued @entity2 is now her husband			1
when they arrived in @entity104 , @entity134 proposed and they married in a quiet register office ceremony , with no fuss , and returned to work afterwards			2
she said : ‘ we both worked in the same factory - we had taken any jobs we could get as we did n't want to go on benefits			0

and now we 've been together for 26 years			0
’ @entity2 has nothing to do with her family in @entity3			1
when her brother and then her father died she returned for their funerals but said her family members were distant			2
@entity2 has managed to completely turn her life around and decided to go into politics as a way of bringing the issue of forced marriage into the public eye			2
but it took her a long time before she could talk about her story - and it was her son who prompted the turn around			2
she said : ‘ my son came home from college one day and said , “ are you ashamed of me ? ” ‘ i asked him what he meant and he said he worried i was ashamed of him because i had never spoken about what happened to me			0
‘ he said i should speak up to help other young women and so that 's what i decided to do			0
