hair dyes used by millions of women contain chemicals linked to cancer , @entity1 scientists have warned			1
they say that both home hair colouring kits and the dyes used at expensive salons pose a potential risk to health			1
writing in a respected scientific journal , they say chemicals in permanent hair dyes can react with tobacco smoke and other pollutants in the air to form one of the most powerful cancer - causing compounds known to man			1
high risk beauty : the hair dye chemicals could react with tobacco smoke and exhaust fumes , to form highly poisonous chemicals called n - nitrosamines with more than a third of women and one in ten men regularly colouring their hair , the researchers say it is ‘ imperative ’ that the risk to health is quantified			1
however , the cosmetics industry has strongly disputed the claim			0
the warning comes from scientists at @entity41 - based company @entity40 who conducted a review of the chemistry surrounding hair dye			2
they said that all the information was already available and they simply ‘ joined the dots ’ to make the link with cancer			0
they warn that chemicals called secondary amines , which are either found in all permanent hair dyes or are formed in them , can penetrate the skin and stay on the hair for weeks , months or even years after the dye is applied			1
over time , they could react with tobacco smoke and exhaust fumes , to form highly poisonous chemicals called n - nitrosamines			1
unsafe : even dyes used at expensive salons can contain the dangerous chemicals known to cause cancer , these are banned from use in cosmetics			2
but the @entity41 researchers argue that they can still be generated via a simple chemical reaction			0
hair dye has previously been linked to a range of cancers , including tumours of the breast , bladder , ovaries and brain and leukaemia			0
there are also concerns that increasing numbers of people are becoming allergic to their contents , sometimes with fatal results			0
the sale of home hair dye kits alone is worth an estimated £ 321million a year and the figure is expected to rise as the population ages			1
professor @entity89 , one of the authors of the study , and an expert in the chemistry of various dyes , said : ‘ at this stage , we ca n’t be sure of the amount of n - nitrosamines produced or the level of risk these compounds pose but it is clear a potential hazard exists			0
‘ in the interest of consumer safety , it is imperative that a thorough and independent investigation is conducted to establish the levels of toxicity of these compounds and the potential risks			0
’ a spokesman for @entity40 , which is about to launch its own ‘ ultra-safe ’ range of hair dyes , said that despite numerous studies of the subject the danger posed by the chemicals in hair dye reacting with the air has been missed or ignored until now			1
but manufacturers insisted that the possibility of the chemical reaction has been long known			0
dr @entity124 , of the @entity125 , said the law forbids using secondary amines in a form that can react in this way			1
@entity130 , the owner of @entity131 at @entity132 , the world ’s largest hair and beauty salon , said : ‘ chemical companies have a huge vested interest in keeping this under wraps			0
’ the warning is set out in the journal @entity142			0
in 2009 the @entity143 revealed that women who use hair dyes more than nine times a year have a 60 per cent greater risk of contracting blood cancer			2
a year later the @entity149 banned 22 hair dyes which put long term users at risk of bladder cancer .			2

secondary amines can be found in hair dyes used by millions of @entity1
both home colouring kits and salon dye can contain chemicals
could react with smoke and fumes and form highly poisonous chemicals
