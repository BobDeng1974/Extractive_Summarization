there are numerous fascinating experiments taking place on the @entity3 at any time , including efforts to monitor how plants grow in space			2
but a tree that was grown from a cherry pit that travelled into space five years ago and is now back in solid ground is baffling scientists after it bloomed far earlier than its terrestrial counterparts			1
the tree made the trip 229 mile ( 370km ) above the @entity14 around five years ago with astronaut @entity15 , who is now commander of the @entity3 the pit sent to space was one of around 265 produced from the fruit of a famous 1,250 - year - old @entity21 - zakura cherry tree ( pictured ) , which grows in the @entity23 temple , in @entity24 , which lies to the east of @entity26 , @entity27 scientists were astonished when it bloomed much earlier than normal cherry trees , which typically do n’t produce blossom for a decade			1
the pit was one of around 265 produced from the fruit of a famous 1,250 - year - old @entity34 cherry tree , which grows in the @entity23 temple , in @entity24 , which lies to the east of @entity26			1
the tree which produced the pits - that were blasted into space in 2008 and returned a year later - is said to originate from the seventh century			1
the tree made the trip 229 mile ( 370km ) above the @entity14 around five years ago with astronaut @entity15 , who is now commander of the iss. pictured here commander @entity15 is attempting to understand the mechanisms of how plants build their shape while resisting gravity at nearly £ 14,000 ( $ 23,000 ) to send a kilogram of food into space , cosmic cuisine does n’t come cheap			1
but @entity48 hopes that in the future it can grow vast quantities of its own food in space			0
as well as cutting costs , @entity48 is hoping a ' space farm ' will deliver a lasting supply of food for astronauts on deep space missions			0
it could also provide something called ‘ horticultural therapy ’ for astronauts to reduce stress , alleviate depression and improve their overall general health			0
the work is part of the @entity65 ( veggie ) to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink led lamps			0
@entity48 claims that after extensive testing on plants on @entity14 , it does n’t expect zero - gravity conditions to affect the growth of the plants			0
the @entity34 tree is a type of the wild cherry species which is notoriously difficult to grow			2
the @entity76 reported that until now the ‘ space cherry ’ attempts to grow young trees from the pits have been unsuccessful			2
but by covering soil with sphagnum moss , 78 - year - old botanist @entity81 managed to get one of the pits from the @entity3 to sprout			1
and remarkably in four years , the young plants was already 13ft ( four metres ) high			0
it produced 10 buds , which bloomed last week , some four years before expected			1
mr @entity81 said that it usually takes at least a decade for young cherry trees to flower and that other trees that have grown from the pits from the @entity3 have also bloomed , perhaps suggesting that their extraordinary journey has somehow accelerated their growth			1
all the pits were planted in @entity97 and @entity98 in the hope that they might flower one day			0
the cherry pit came from the @entity23 temple , in @entity24 , @entity27			2
the tree which produced the pits - that were blasted into space in 2008 and returned a year later - is said to originate from the seventh century botanist @entity105 , of the @entity106 , who was involved in the space experiment does not know why the space cherries are thriving			1
‘ there is a theoretical possibility that the cosmic environment has had a certain impact on agents in the seeds that control budding and the growth process , but we have absolutely no answer as to why the trees have come into bloom so fast , ’ she said			1
intriguingly , while each flower of the parent tree has around 30 petals , the ‘ space cherry ’ blooms only have five petals			2
‘ as it is grown from a seed , the young plant might have reverted back to have the characteristics of original yamazakura species , ’ dr @entity81 said , before hypothesising that the number of petals on each flower might increase as the tree matures			0
at nearly £ 14,000 ( $ 23,000 ) to send a kilogram of food to the @entity3 ( pictured ) , cosmic cuisine does n't come cheap			0
but @entity48 hopes that in the future it can grow vast quantities of its own food in space			0

tree was grown from a cherry pit that travelled into space five years ago
pit was from 1,250 - year - old @entity34 cherry tree in @entity27
in four years , one of the pits from @entity3 had already grown four metres high
it produced 10 buds , which bloomed last week - 4 years before expected
botanist @entity105 said : ‘ the cosmic environment has had a certain impact on agents in the seeds that control budding and the growth process '
