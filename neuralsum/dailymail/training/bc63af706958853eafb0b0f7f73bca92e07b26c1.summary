by @entity0 published : 18:43 est , 31 august 2013 updated : 22:32 est , 31 august 2013 @entity2 ’s standing as a world leader and @entity5 ’s much vaunted ‘ special relationship ’ with @entity6 have both been badly hit by his @entity8 defeat over military strikes against @entity10			1
and @entity11 has won approval for opposing the action			1
but the prime minister is applauded for giving mps the chance to vote on the issue – and is still seen as much better at dealing with international crises than the opposition leader , including by many @entity21 voters			1
political capital : prime minister @entity2 , left , is still seen as more of a statesman that @entity21 leader @entity11 , right , despite his humiliating defeat in the @entity8 after urging mps to back an attack on @entity10 that is the verdict of a @entity29 poll on the row over whether the @entity5 should support air strikes against the @entity10 regime of president @entity33 by the @entity6			1
despite the bitter commons clashes over @entity10 between @entity2 and @entity11 , there is no change in the party ratings , with @entity21 , on 37 per cent , maintaining an eight point lead over the conservatives and the @entity40 trailing @entity41			1
an overwhelming 65 per cent are opposed to @entity5 raids on @entity10 , with only 19 per cent in favour , according to the @entity45 poll			0
however , that could change dramatically if @entity33 does not back down			0
nearly one in two say they would support military action if @entity33 orders more mass chemical weapons attacks , with three in ten against			0
barely one in five say the prime minister is in touch with public opinion over @entity10 , compared to nearly two in five who say mr @entity11 has judged the public mood correctly			2
but despite the doubts , four out of ten say they trust mr @entity2 in an international crisis , against just over two in ten who back mr @entity11			2
worryingly for the opposition leader , nearly one in six @entity21 supporters prefers mr @entity2			2
a majority of 41 per cent say the @entity10 affair has damaged @entity2 ’s global standing , compared to 38 per cent who say it has made no difference and seven per cent who say it has enhanced it			2
one in three also say it has damaged @entity5 ’s so called ‘ special relationship ’ with the @entity6 , though nearly half believe it has made no difference			0
a clear majority say the prime minister spends too much time strutting the world stage , instead of fixing @entity5 ’s problems			0
but more than half say mr @entity2 showed strength , not weakness , by letting mps vote on the issue			1
and 43 per cent say the vote enhanced the reputation of @entity86 , left in tatters by the expenses scandal , compared to 23 per cent who say the anti-war vote was bad for the reputation of the @entity8			0
a total of 1,002 people took part in the @entity45 online poll , conducted on friday .			0

the *pm* is applauded for giving mps the chance to vote on the issue
but his standing as a world leader has been badly hit by the loss
however voters still judge him a better statesman than @entity11
