deep in north - eastern @entity1 , a neglected airstrip has been identified as a key staging post in the @entity4 ’s clandestine torture programme			1
for the first time , a detailed picture of how the @entity4 flew terror suspects into @entity7 and on to a nearby ‘ dark site ’ for brutal interrogations has emerged			1
they were hooded , handcuffed and shackled for ‘ enhanced interrogation ’ at nearby stare kiejkuty base			2
the detainees would arrive , sometimes in the dead of night , in aircraft owned by @entity4 ‘ shell companies ’			1
some of the most brutal torture sessions in the @entity4 ’s murky war against terror took place near this forbidding spot			1
mrs @entity11 , who ran @entity7 airport at the time , told of her shock at discovering she may have seen the arrival of the @entity4 ’s most high - value prisoner , @entity40			1
known as @entity40 to the @entity4 , he was waterboarded no fewer than 183 times by his captors , both during his six months in @entity1 and at other @entity4 facilities			1
the @entity14 has learned that the @entity46 executive jet which ‘ dropped off ’ @entity40 in @entity1 then went on to stay overnight at @entity17 , where it stopped for 24 hours , presumably to allow the flight crew to rest			1
the role of @entity7 airport was highlighted in last week ’s @entity50 @entity49 on @entity4 renditions			1
after being flown here , prisoners were transferred 13 miles on near - deserted roads to @entity55 , where they were tortured			0
mrs @entity11 realised the clandestine activity signified some kind of undercover operations being conducted but had no idea the facility was being used for ‘ extraordinary rendition ’			2
the 57 - year - old grandmother became suspicious after traffic to the airport suddenly picked up in late 2002			0
‘ the airport was n’t doing well economically , operations were being run down , ’ she recalled			2
from december 2002 , however , as president @entity72 ’s ‘ war on terror ’ escalated , the small planes she was used to seeing gave way to much bigger jets which thundered dangerously down the runway			2
@entity73 , 100 miles from @entity20 , was known by @entity74 ‘ on one occasion the airport director told me a “ special ” flight was due to arrive the next day and it had to be given landing permission at any cost			2
i told him that would n’t be possible as there had been a lot of snow			0
‘ he said something like , “ do n’t worry about that , bring in an outside contractor			0
however much it costs , we will pay ”			0
when the plane touched down , it turned out to be an @entity50 - owned @entity46 jet , which we ’d never seen before at the airport			1
the customs staff were told to go home and a border police unit was brought in for the day , which was extremely unusual			0
‘ two military cars from the intelligence base at @entity55 drove up to the aircraft and after a few minutes returned to the airport building and then went out through the main gate			1
we could n’t see what was going on because the cars had darkened windows			1
i assumed the flight was bringing in secret agents			0
’ the view of the tower on the airport in @entity110 @entity40 told a @entity50 military tribunal he saw snow when the plane bringing him from @entity114 stopped over in @entity115			1
mrs @entity11 now believes she may have been at @entity7 when the @entity118 terrorist ’s plane touched down			1
she is unsure of the date , but independent records show his flight almost certainly arrived at @entity7 on march 7 , 2003			0
‘ i have my suspicions that this was the flight which we were under orders to accept at any cost , ’ she said			0
‘ everything was hidden from us			0
’ mrs @entity11 recalled a @entity1 civilian official who would always take care of landing fees in cash			1
‘ they would pay up to six times the normal charge for a civilian aircraft and we were instructed to keep away and ask no questions			0
’ the normal landing fee of around £ 380 could soar up to £ 2,300 for the flights , she said			1
on one occasion , mrs @entity140 noticed a quiet @entity50 woman in the background when a flight came in			1
she recalled : ‘ she was smartly dressed and did n’t speak to us but we were told she was from the @entity50 embassy			2
she waited near the office in the airport building and did n’t go near the planes			0
it was as if she did n’t want to know too much about what was going on			0
’ on september 22 , 2003 , a @entity152 was given permission to land at @entity7 , although the runway was unsuitable for an aircraft of this size			2
mrs @entity11 said the flight plan indicated it had come from @entity158 and was scheduled to refuel at @entity20 ’s main civilian airport before going on to @entity160			0
‘ this was inexplicable because if it could get to @entity7 why could n’t it fly directly to @entity20 which is only 100 miles or so away ? ‘ we should not have accepted the flight – there were n’t even any firefighters on duty , which is illegal – but we were given no choice			2
once again , two military vehicles went out to meet it , waited for a few moments at the aircraft steps and then headed in the direction of @entity55			0
i saw several more 737s after that			0
’ the @entity49 report reveals the @entity1 authorities initially refused to allow @entity40 into the country , claiming they had accepted enough prisoners on behalf of the @entity50 already			1
but their stance crumbled when the @entity50 ambassador personally intervened with the government in @entity20 , followed by a @entity4 delivery of $ 15 million in cash , after which @entity1 officials assured the @entity50 they would be more flexible			1
research by the @entity189 , a collaboration between academics at @entity193 and @entity194 universities , has pieced together the journey followed by the plane almost certainly carrying @entity40 – a @entity198 jet , code - number @entity199 and owned by a @entity4 company			1
records show that on march 7 , the plane arrived at @entity7 with two passengers and two crew			2
it stayed on the ground for two and a half hours , then flew to @entity208 , stopping for an hour , before flying to @entity17 where it stopped for over 24 hours			0
on the morning of march 9 , the aircraft left for @entity211			0
mrs @entity11 said : ‘ i feel a deep sense of shame that politicians let this to happen			0
this has left a terrible stain on my country			0
