in an attempt to drag the @entity15 world 's biggest country from crisis a decree issued by @entity11 pointed to a parliamentary ballot within about six months with a presidential vote to follow			0
but senior officials in @entity3 's @entity20 rejected the plans with leading figure @entity22 saying the blueprint for constitutional changes ' brings the country back to square one '			1

' i 'll be blunt - this is an incredibly complex and difficult situation , ' @entity128 press secretary @entity132 answered when asked whether what occurred in @entity3 was a coup			2
' there are significant consequences that go along with this determination , and it is a highly charged issue for millions of @entity3 who have different views about what happened			2
' he added , ' it would not be in the best interests of the @entity126 to immediately change our assistance program to @entity3			2
' @entity150 , like the administration , is trying to reconcile democratic principles and @entity126 interests			0
@entity153 and his national security team have condemned the violence , which killed at least 51 @entity9 protesters and three security forces on monday alone , but have n't condemned the military for seizing power			1
several lawmakers have followed that lead , rejecting any immediate move to cut off aid at a time when the @entity20 is calling for all - out rebellion against the army and any power vacuum could be filled by @entity169 militant groups that might threaten stability in the @entity15 world 's most populous country , or in @entity173 next door			1

sen. @entity186 , @entity187 , lamented monday : ' in @entity3 , governments come and go			2
the only thing certain is that @entity126 taxpayers will continue to be stuck with the $ 1.5 billion bill			0
' the bloodshed has shocked @entity3 , already tired of the turbulence that began 2 - 1/2 years ago with the overthrow of autocrat @entity195 in a popular uprising			2
it also raised alarm among key donors like the @entity126 and the @entity200 , as well as in @entity173 , with which @entity3 has had a @entity126 - backed peace treaty since 1979			2
millions of people took to the streets on june 30 to demand @entity8 's resignation , fearing he was orchestrating a creeping @entity9 takeover of the state - a charge the @entity20 has vehemently denied			1
but for many islamists , the overthrow of @entity3 's first freely elected president was a bitter reversal that raised fears of a return to the suppression they endured for decades under autocratic rulers like @entity195			2
protesters said monday 's shooting started as they performed morning prayers outside the barracks			2
but military spokesman @entity221 said that at 4 a.m. ( 0200 gmt ) armed men attacked troops in the area in the northeast of the city			0
emergency services said 435 people were wounded			0
at a hospital near @entity68 's @entity231 mosque , where many of the wounded and dead were taken , rooms were crammed full , sheets were stained with blood and medics rushed to attend to those hurt			0

young men , some carrying sticks , crouched behind a building , emerging to throw petrol bombs before retreating again			0
the graphic scenes came just three days after @entity68 , @entity271 and other cities and towns were rocked by running street battles between @entity8 's supporters and opponents , which went on for hours despite a heavy military presence			1
@entity11 decreed that @entity3 will hold new parliamentary elections once amendments to its suspended constitution are approved in a referendum - a process that could take about six months , less than some people had expected			0
however , it was faulted for repeating flaws in the 2011 transition plan that contributed to the current crisis			0
in what appeared to be an olive branch to @entity9 , the decree included controversial language put into the constitution last year that defined the principles of @entity169 sharia law			0
bloodshed : a @entity20 member receives medical attention after being injured during the violence in the line of fire : an injured man is wheeled into a makeshift hospital where victims are being brought following clashes between @entity3 military and @entity20 supporters injured : supporters of deposed @entity3 president @entity8 help a wounded protester outside the @entity39 headquarters in @entity68 turmoil : a man grieves at a makeshift hospital where victims are being brought following clashes between @entity3 police and @entity20 supporters fighting for their cause : wounded supporters of president @entity8 wait for treatment at a field hospital in @entity68 collateral damage : an ambulance driver lies on a hospital bed after being shot while trying to help the injured whether that will be enough to lure back the hardline @entity326 , which had supported the military - led transition plans until monday 's attack , remains to be seen			1
@entity329 , a leading expert on @entity3 's constitution at @entity331 in @entity332 , said that while monday 's decree laid out a clear sequence for transition , it repeated many of the mistakes of the @entity339 process			1
' it was drawn up by an anonymous committee ; it was issued by executive fiat ; the timetable is rushed ; the provisions for consultation are vague ; and it promises inclusiveness but gives no clear procedural guidelines for it , ' he told @entity252			0
the @entity20 movement has refused to have anything to do with the process , and thousands of supporters have camped out in northeast @entity68 for the last five days and vowed not to budge until @entity8 returns as president - a seemingly vain hope			1
taking cover : @entity20 members gather behind barricades during clashes with the military over the ouster of president @entity8 which has left dozens dead and a further 300 injured in @entity68 outraged : @entity8 's supporters refuse to recognise the interim leader and insist the ex-president be reinstated out in force : @entity3 @entity39 guards take up positions in front of a barricade during clashes with members of the @entity20 near rabaa aldwya in @entity68 brink of civil war : @entity3 army soldiers take their positions near armored vehicles at the entrance of @entity376 in @entity68 , where dozens of people were killed in clashes outside a military building in the capital at the ready : amid conflicting reports , the military said initial information indicates that gunmen affiliated with the @entity20 tried to storm the @entity39 building shortly after dawn carnage : an @entity3 health ministry official said initial reports indicated at least 300 were wounded transition : @entity3 's military chief has replaced @entity8 with an interim leader until presidential elections are held unrest : an @entity3 woman walks past army forces on a bridge leading to @entity376 in @entity68 the events have worried @entity400 allies			1

' ' the @entity406 condemns these killings and calls for them to be thoroughly investigated by independent and competent national bodies , ' it said in a statement			0
the @entity126 , still refraining from calling the military intervention a ' coup ' - a label that would trigger legal obstacles to continuing aid payments - called on @entity3 's army to exercise ' maximum restraint			1
' the @entity128 said it was not about to halt aid to @entity3			0
the @entity3 military , recipient of $ 1.3 billion a year from @entity332 , has insisted that the overthrow was not a coup and that it was enforcing the ' will of the people ' after millions took to the streets on june 30 to call for @entity8 's resignation .			2
