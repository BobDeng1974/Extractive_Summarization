by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 may be convinced he can star for @entity3 , but his first stop in @entity6 football looks set to be at @entity7			1
the fastest man in the world , who struck @entity11 gold in the 4x100m relay with @entity13 last weekend , should receive an invite from fellow countryman @entity15 to make a trip to @entity17 in the coming months			1
@entity15 explained the pair know each other from back home - going out for a drink during downtime this summer - and @entity2 would n’t hesitate in saying yes to taking in a game			1
‘ and though he supports @entity3 , i know he will come here			0
who knows ? he might even start supporting us after ! ’ that trip could be sooner than expected			0
the six - time @entity42 champion stays and trains with his agent in @entity45 , south west @entity24 , when competing on the continent and is pencilled in to run at the @entity48 meeting in @entity49 on august 28 ; @entity52 ’s side host @entity15 ’s old club @entity53 two days later			1
‘ i saw @entity2 when i went home in the summer , ’ @entity15 added			1
‘ we always hang out together and go for a drink			0
everybody knows everybody in @entity13			1
‘ even though people might see him as this so - called superstar , he is just a normal guy			0
you could pass @entity2 on the street and say hi			1
he would n’t be able to do that here , but it is different in @entity13			2
’ winners : @entity2 celebrates with his teammates after anchoring the quintent to gold in the men 's 4x100m relay @entity2 ’s friend @entity15 signed a one - year deal with @entity7 in july and , although he is very much an elder statesman in the group , is putting younger colleagues to shame across the ground in pre-season			1
hardly surprising , the striker rationalises , given his nationality			0
‘ @entity2 ’s trainer , @entity81 , used to coach me on the track as well , ’ he added			2
‘ me and @entity84 ( 35 ) are the fastest players in training			0
we posted the same time			0
but i should have broken the record – i let him off the hook ! ’ there may be charisma and measured arrogance radiating from @entity2 , but @entity7 ’s @entity13 is n’t missing much swagger either			1
@entity15 insisted he took a four - week break before finally committing to the club			2
‘ i spent the first month enjoying myself , seeing family and friends and then after the first month i started training and getting back into it , ’ he said			0
‘ i knew about @entity7 over a month before i came here			2
@entity53 also wanted to do something but we all know about the problems they are having			0
’ video i do n't know if we will get promoted - @entity52			0

fastest man in the world is good friends with @entity7 striker
@entity15 wanted to watch @entity13 at the @entity112
@entity2 is known to be a *big* *fan* of @entity116 's side
