@entity12 said @entity0 was ‘ no longer a danger to women ’ and would not commit any further offences			1
he said the trial judge had been wrong to consider @entity0 ’s bizarre behaviour outside court when sentencing , when he stood behind a television presenter covering the trial and mimicked his broadcast			1
and he said the judge at @entity1 , judge @entity24 , should not have imposed maximum two - year sentences for two of the indecent assaults after saying they were ‘ not the gravest offences of their type ’			2
mr @entity31 told the @entity7 in @entity32 : ‘ although the sentencing process must reflect modern attitudes – and i fully accept that that is our law – the sentencing process must not abandon common sense and fairness			0
’ @entity0 , who abused the young women and girls between 1977 and 1984 , watched the court hearing on a videolink from @entity43 , a category c prison in @entity44			2
he looked tired and gaunt and fidgeted during the 90 - minute hearing , eventually complaining he could not hear one of the lawyers over the videolink			0
@entity48 , for the @entity49 , said the trial judge was entitled to impose the eight - year sentence			0
she said @entity0 ’s public statements and denials after his arrest and during his trial had been intended to ‘ manipulate , undermine and humiliate ’ his victims			0
