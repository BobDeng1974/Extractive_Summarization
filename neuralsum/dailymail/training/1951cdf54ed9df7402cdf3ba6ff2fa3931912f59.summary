a 90 - year - old man who was arrested for feeding the homeless in his @entity3 city was back at it on wednesday , despite being apprehended by police on tuesday			1
@entity6 has helped to prepare hundreds of meals a week for countless hungry homeless persons in @entity9 , @entity3 , since 1990 , but a new ordinance now makes this illegal in the city			1
as a result , @entity6 and and two ministers from the @entity13 were arrested while dishing out hot food on tuesday night			2
and after they finished serving food , police again arrested @entity6			2
it seems that despite @entity6 's amazing charitable ways , the mayor of the city , @entity37 , has nothing but disgust for the selfless old man			2
@entity37 told local 10 , ' mr. @entity6 has decided that he does n't think these individuals should have to have any interaction with government , that they should be fed in the parks			0
' dishing it out : @entity6 says he received calls from all over the world on wednesday supporting him capturing the clergy : in addition to @entity6 , police arrested two local ministers for feeding the homeless on tuesday ( above ) common criminal : now , @entity6 is facing two $ 500 fines and up to four months in prison @entity6 , however , has brought up the point that many of these people would be forced to dumpster dive , or just starve , without these meals			1
' what the city is doing by cutting out feeding is very simple -- they are forcing homeless people to go dumpster - diving all over again , ' @entity6 said			1
that 's what the mayor is forcing the homeless to do			0
' classic villain : mayor @entity37 even came out against @entity6 's charity work , saying he ' disagrees ' with what he is doing and many seem to agree with him , with @entity6 saying he received calls from around the world on wednesday			1
' i love the city			0
i live here , it 's a beautiful place and i 'd like to keep it beautiful , but you can not sweep the homeless under a rug , ' explained @entity6			0
' there is no rug large enough for that			0
' @entity6 is likely to face a $ 500 fine for each arrest and could be sentenced to up to four months behind bars .			0
