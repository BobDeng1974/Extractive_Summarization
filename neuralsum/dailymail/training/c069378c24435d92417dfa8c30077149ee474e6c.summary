by @entity0 proud @entity2 mum @entity1 is still pinching herself after specialists successfully performed a rare life - saving operation on her unborn twins @entity6 and @entity7 in the womb			1
the need for surgery arose during ms @entity1 's pregnancy because her girls were sharing the same placenta			0
the @entity15 dr @entity14 and a team of specialists from two other @entity19 hospitals from the @entity20 worked together on the operation			1
@entity1 is feeling grateful after specialists successfully performed a rare life - saving operation on her unborn twins @entity6 and @entity7 in the womb			1
she is pictured at @entity25 nursing daughter @entity6 , while @entity7 remains in an isolette ' essentially blood can flow freely between the babies and that can cause problems , ' dr @entity14 told @entity32 of twins sharing a placenta			1
this can affect how much blood the babies can get and also means what happens to one baby can affect the other			1
in ms @entity1 's case , @entity6 had a larger share of the blood supply , which meant @entity7 was at risk of not surviving in the womb			1
' had @entity7 passed away , because of the blood flow , it could have impacted on @entity6 , who would have been at risk of passing away , ' dr @entity14 said			1
' it would have been a disaster			0
' as part of the surgery , doctors inserted a telescope into ms @entity1 's abdomen and into her uterus			2
on average just two of these life - saving operations are performed in @entity19 hospitals each year ' through the telescope , we could look and see blood vessels that connected the two babies through the placenta			1
we passed a laser fibre through the telescope to seal off the connecting vessels , ' dr @entity14 said			0
' this ends uneven sharing of blood between the babies			1
' the operation also meant that if @entity7 had still died in the womb , @entity6 would not be affected			1
' that was the aim , ' dr @entity14 said			0
while the surgery is not unheard of , dr @entity14 said there were only up to two a year completed in @entity19 each year			1
' it worked well and what we hoped to achieve , although we did not necessarily expect it , it was what we were working towards , ' dr @entity14 said			0
the surgery also enabled the pregnancy to progress longer , which benefited the development of the babies , but due to ms @entity1 's pre-eclampsia , doctors endued a premature pregnancy on may 6			2
dr @entity14 and a team of specialists from two other @entity19 hospitals worked together on the operation ms @entity1 , 42 , said she had serious doubts that @entity7 would survive the pregnancy			1
' right until the night before they were born , we were talking to palliative care about @entity7 and we did n't expect her to be here today , ' she said			2
' we talked about resuscitation if she was n't breathing			0
' ' it was definitely a relief , ' she said of both girls being born alive and healthy			2
@entity6 was born weighing 1.4 kilograms and is now 2.3 kilograms , while @entity7 was just 568 grams at birth			2
but ms @entity1 said with both girls born premature , they had done exceptionally well			2
' @entity7 is pretty much doing really really well			0
she had a stomach infection but she 's over that now , ' she said			0
' she 's now nearly a kilo and that was a few days ago so i 'm hoping she hits a kilo next week			0
from the picture we took when they were two days old , til now is completely different			0
' the @entity15 where ms @entity1 's life - saving pregnancy operation was performed ms @entity1 said she also had to opportunity to see dr @entity14 after the girls were born			1
' he came in the day the day after they were born to see me in the room and he was very surprised that little @entity7 was still going and quite well , ' she said			2
' i was really quite grateful he took time out to see how i was and how the girls were			0
' despite being discharged four days after the birth , ms @entity1 has returned to hospital everyday since to be with her girls			0
' @entity6 is very close to coming home , potentially monday			0
they were born at 31 weeks , so she 'll only be 37 weeks when she goes home so its surprising everyone , ' she said			1
' she 's started feeding occasionally when she was 34 - 35 weeks			1
' but she said although @entity7 was doing well and progressing , she was expected to be in hospital longer			0
' it will be a little while yet before she gets to feed the way @entity6 is ... and it will still be a while before she comes , ' she said			0
' it 's still too early to discuss because she 's in the isolette ' .			0
