it is an astonishing animation , letting you travel through the solar system at the speed of light			1
riding @entity4 is a 45 - minute short film that attempts to recreate what it would be like to hitch a ride on the back of a photon			0
the realtime video allows viewers to travel from the core of the sun to beyond the orbit of @entity16			1
see the full video below the realtime video allows viewers to travel from the core of the sun to beyond the orbit of @entity16			1
here , the journey begins on the sun 's surface			2
as the journey progresses , users are shown stats about how far they have travelled - and when the next planet is coming up ,			0
' in our terrestrial view of things , the speed of light seems incredibly fast , ' animator @entity27 said			0
' but as soon as you view it against the vast distances of the universe , it 's unfortunately very slow			0
' this animation illustrates , in realtime , the journey of a photon of light emitted from the sun and traveling across a portion of the solar system			1
' although the video does not address how we would even perceive light and time if we were traveling at the same speed , it does use accurate distances and speeds to convey how big our solar system really is			1
' i 've taken liberties with certain things like the alignment of planets and asteroids , but overall i 've kept the size and distances of all the objects as accurate as possible , ' said @entity27			2
the animation ends at @entity16 - to keep the film under an hour ' i also decided to end the animation just past @entity16 as i wanted to keep the running length below an hour			2
' the upper left corner keeps track of distance traveled and time elapsed since you 've been vomited from the sun 's core and the upper right has a countdown to your next planetary encounter			0
@entity27 , a @entity74 animator who has worked for everyone from @entity76 to the @entity77 , said he got the idea from a book			0
' after nerding out on some astronomy books and documentaries , i wanted to illustrate how slow the speed of light is in relation to the vast size of the universe			0
' this animation shows , in realtime , the journey of a photon of light emitted from the sun and traveling across a portion of the solar system			1
