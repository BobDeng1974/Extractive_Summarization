what started as a peaceful protest against the @entity2 quickly turned violent by nightfall with officers in riot gear breaking out the tear gas			1
at least 500 people gathered on the steps of the @entity2 on sunday to condemn the recent police killing of 38 - year - old @entity11			1
earlier this week hacktivist group @entity12 posted a video online calling for locals to occupy police headquarters and take a stand against @entity11 's ' cold blooded ' murder			1
' let them know that your city is not a place for war games against the homeless and the less fortunate , ' the group said in the video			0
while there were no reports of injuries or arrests in the early hours of the protest , things took a turn as night fell with police using tear gas on the group and making arrests			1
justified ? @entity11 was killed march 16 after a stand - off with police in the @entity58 foothills where he was camped out ' hey hey ! ho ho ! killer cops have got to go ! ' the protesters , wearing @entity84 ' masks , chanted			1
the masks have become a rallying symbol for @entity12 , which also seems to have hacked into the @entity2 website today - causing it to shutdown from morning until at least 4:30pm			1
a @entity90 account claiming to be connected to the organization tweeted a list of @entity2 officers phone @entity96 police spokesman could not confirm whether the numbers were authentic			0
while police showed up with batons and riot gear , the demonstration remained peaceful with protesters marching between @entity2 headquarters , @entity67 and the @entity69 campus for several hours			1
police even shut down a street to make sure none of the protesters were injured in traffic			0
but things took a turn about eight hours into the protest when the demonstrators started vandalizing property , with one person trying to take down a street sign , others spray - painting property and a group trying to push over a police cruiser			2
when the protest returned to @entity2 headquarters officers warned the crowd to clear the area since it was an unlawful protest			2
but the protesters said they would n't stop until the police chief is fired , prompting police to release at least a dozen tear gas canisters on the group gathered on @entity131 around 9:30pm			1
there were reports of several people being arrested and taken away in police cruisers			0
at least one police officer was injured in the protest , and another was isolated in his car while a group of protesters tried to break the windows			0
locals are being told to avoid the area while residents at the @entity69 are sheltering in their dorms			1
state senator @entity146 tweeted that his daughter was in one of the @entity69 dorms impacted by the tear gas			1
' we respected their rights to protest obviously , ' mayor @entity151 said , ' but what it appears we have at this time is individuals who were n’t connected necessarily with the original protest … they ’ve taken it far beyond a normal protest			0
' the protesters were marching in response to the march 16 police killing of @entity11 , 38 , who was found camped out in the hills surrounding @entity58			1
@entity169 camera footage released by the apd shows half a dozen officers standing 20 feet away from the man shouting ' get on the ground ' and ' drop the knife ! ' before shooting unloaded beanbags , stun guns and live rounds on him			0
@entity11 , who police say had a lengthy criminal record , later died			2
curtained off : the protest led police to shut down one street for safety police in riot gear great protesters at a major thoroughfare their message : protesters hold up signs reading ' i 'm mad ' and ' @entity192 ends now ' on the steps of police headquarters face to face : police officers holding batons meet a group of seated protesters on an @entity58 street lined up : police officers hold their places during the protests on sunday shooters : @entity2 officers @entity204 ( left ) and @entity205 ( right ) were placed on leave following @entity11 's killing officers @entity204 and @entity205 have been placed on leave since the incident			1
but @entity58 police chief @entity211 said in a press conference that he thought his officers ' actions were justified			2
‘ the officers were attempting to affect a felony arrest using less - than lethal weapons , including a distractive device , @entity219 , and a @entity221 shotgun , ’ @entity211 said			0
authorities said @entity11 threatened to kill a @entity224 officer called to the scene			2
when @entity11 refused to follow police orders and an unarmed @entity219 officer got close to him , officers @entity204 and @entity205 shot toward @entity11 , @entity211 said			2
the video footage shows an injured @entity11 with two five - inch knives in his hand when officers surround and handcuff him			2
police in @entity58 are facing intense criticism after video footage was released which appears to show officers using excessive force to apprehend @entity11 , a homeless man who was holding two knives two police officers each fired three bullets causing @entity11 to fall to the ground			1
a medical examiner has not yet determined if the bullets killed @entity11 the video footage shows an injured @entity11 with two five - inch knives in his hand when officers surround and handcuff him ‘ the suspect did in fact make a decision not to follow the directions that ( were ) provided to him by the officers , ’ @entity211 said			1
‘ on many occasions he said that he was not going to come off that mountain			0
’ however , @entity11 's death is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to police killings in the @entity258 capital			1
the @entity259 has been investigating the @entity58 police for a year , following reports of more than three dozen police shootings since 2010			2
‘ we need to look at some changes within the department , but i think more importantly we need to restore confidence in the @entity58 police department , ’ said @entity263 president @entity262			0
state senator @entity269 said he was responding to worried constituents			0
he says he was disturbed not only by the video , but by @entity2 police chief @entity211 ’s comments that the shooting was justified			0
‘ i 'm very concerned about the chief of police immediately jumping to conclusions , ’ @entity275 said			0
‘ i think we all know with camera on the lapel video - something definitely happened			0
’ @entity262 said he was concerned about how the public now sees the @entity2			0
