' there have been rumours surrounding the bones for hundreds of years and i wanted to put them to rest and work out the real reason why the crypt was built , ' said @entity55 , an osteo - archaeologist			2
' many people believed it was used as a sort of rubbish bin to get rid of unwanted human remains , such as plague victims , but actually i think it was a place of pilgrimage			2

here , local school boy @entity77 visits the site at one time there is believed to have been hundreds of bone crypts all over @entity11 , but they were lost during the reformation			1
this one was re-discovered in 1700 by accident when a grave digger fell into the bone house and came across the skeletons			0

' all the theories stemmed from 1700 , so we have been using modern methods to try and unpick them , ' she said			0

' she said there had also been a rumour that the crypt only contained femurs and skulls , but in fact it contained complete skeletons at one time			2
' we now believe there would probably have been hundreds of these crypts around the country at one time and they were a place for people to visit and pray for the dead , ' she said			2
she does not think the jumble of bones belonged to soldiers as they are a mix of men and women and the marks which people thought were battle scars were actually made after they were dead scientists think the bones were moved into the crypt from graves , but they could have come from lots of different cemeteries			2

' ms @entity55 and her team now hope to secure funding to use carbon dating techniques to work out the age and sex of the victims and where they were from			0
' it has been a very exciting project so far and we want to continue to find out more about the skeletons , ' she said			0
' for hundreds of years people have had the wrong impression about the crypt and seen it as a horrible place , but for medieval people it would have been a religious place to visit , much like going to a grave today			0
