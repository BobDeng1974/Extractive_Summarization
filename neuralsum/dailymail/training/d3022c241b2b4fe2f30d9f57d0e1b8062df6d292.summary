by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 were held to a draw in their penultimate @entity4 warm - up game in @entity5 as @entity6 and @entity7 both got their names on the score - sheet			1
@entity10 made 10 changes to the team that beat @entity13 on friday , so who performed and who should be looking over their shoulder ? @entity17 gives his ratings			0
@entity28 : 5 - no hoper in this position at fault for first goal , frequently bettered by @entity33			0
@entity34 : 6 - no hoper does n’t convince but this was an improvement on previous performances at centre half			0
water boy : @entity41 ( right ) made two unnecessary dashes and @entity43 is still @entity1 's no 1 @entity45 : 5.5 - no hoper lost his man for the goal , failed to cut out long balls but a saving block to cut out @entity51			1
@entity52 : 7 - no hoper ( for now ) first start for @entity1 and looked good against @entity54 , @entity21 captain and main threat			1
@entity57 : 7 - no hoper provided stability and poise as @entity21 had long spells of first half possession – but here as back up			2
marauding : @entity52 got forward from left back at every opportunity @entity65 : 6 - possible wants to be everywhere ; ends up being nowhere important			1
improved in second half , as team did			0
will doubtless get some game time			0
@entity69 : 7.5 - possible lost possession for goal but a great threat going forward			1
did all he good to win a place			2
on brink of starting 11			0
@entity76 : 7 - possible great nutmeg and run for @entity1 ’s second			1
excites going forward but loses possession too frequently in dangerous areas			1
most likely an impact sub			0
out muscled : @entity76 is knocked off the ball by @entity21 's skipper @entity54 @entity6 : 8 - definite @entity1 ’s biggest threat in the first half , looking considerably sharper than friday night			1
@entity7 : 7 - possible saw very little of the ball first half ; got his reward with a fine 52nd minute goal in the second and an improved performance - but here as back up			0
@entity92 ( for @entity52 74 ) : 6 - no hoper another one for the future			2
a solid 15 minute and a second @entity1 cap			2
@entity96 ( for @entity69 63 ) : 6 - no hoper dependable when he came on to make @entity1 debut			2
great experience and encouraging performance			0
@entity102 ( for @entity103 ( much to learn ) @entity105 refs might have waved it on ; but in international football , diving in often brings a red car , whether you get the ball or not			0
( @entity112 for @entity113 ; @entity114 84 ; @entity115 for @entity65 87 ) you 're off : @entity102 and @entity54 were both sent off after they clashed positives from good shape and energy of the second half - until subs disrupted game			1
less so with the defensive stability of his reserve back four and holes in midfield in first half - 6.5 poor start : @entity1 boss @entity10 reacts after seeing his team go a goal down inside 10 minutes @entity132 6 ; @entity133 6 , @entity134 6.5 , @entity135 6.5 , @entity136 7 ; @entity54 7 , @entity137 7.5 , @entity138 6.5 ( @entity139 50 6 ) , @entity33 8 ( @entity140 67 7.5 ) ; @entity141 7.5 ( @entity142 45 6 ) , @entity143 5.5 good shape in midfield and great on the break			1
less sure at the back but an encouraging performance for @entity21 - 7 big call to make on red cards - but sliding in on tackles is a @entity152 no - no. as is retaliation			0
friendly or not , rules are rules - 6.5 familiar faces : @entity54 keeps the ball away from his @entity158 team - mate			2

@entity6 proved to be @entity1 's biggest threat going forward
@entity76 looked exciting but lost possession too easily in *attack*
@entity52 showed off his pace and looked good against @entity54
