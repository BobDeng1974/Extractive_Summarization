the @entity0 has seen significant changes over the past 200 years , since admiral @entity2 sailed @entity3 to glory in the @entity5			1
and to celebrate 2014 being the 209th anniversary of @entity7 - when admiral @entity2 hoisted the flag in conquest - @entity10 has revealed just how far naval engineering has evolved			1
using laser imaging techniques , experts have been able to get under the skin of @entity3 - the oldest commissioned warship in the world - allowing them to draw direct comparisons between the vessel , and @entity18			0
they replaced the previous @entity33 models			0
type 45s are also known as @entity35 , or daring - class , are were primarily designed for anti-aircraft and anti-missile warfare			0
@entity39 is one of the newest commissioned ships in the @entity0 fleet , recently deployed to the @entity42 as part of the international coalition against @entity45			2
teams of shipbuilders and engineers have been able to examine and compare aspects of both vessels , to look at how things have evolved on the seas , and below decks			0
@entity10 is working on both the completed construction and maintenance of @entity18 vessels , and also the ongoing conservation of @entity3			1
using laser imaging techniques , naval engineers have been able to get under the skin of @entity3 ( pictured ) - the oldest commissioned warship in the world - allowing them to draw direct comparisons between the vessel and @entity65 @entity10 is working on both the completed construction and maintenance of @entity18 vessels , including @entity39 ( pictured ) and also the ongoing conservation of @entity3			1
while at sea , @entity3 would have displaced 3,500 tonnes , making it twice as light as @entity39 that displaces 8,000 tonnes the 249 - year - old ship 's £ 50 million conservation program has seen experts from @entity10 using both advanced laser diagrams and traditional crafting techniques - that would have been the same hundreds of years ago when she was originally built - to identify damage to the vessel and help restore it for another decade			1
whilst out at sea , admiral @entity2 's flagship would have displaced 3,500 tonnes in the water , making it twice as light as @entity39 which displaces 8,000 tonnes of seawater by comparison			1
despite this , @entity39 would be the more agile of the two in battle , using its twin @entity93 engines - each capable of lighting the city of @entity95 - to hit a top speed of 30 knots ( 55 km / h )			1
this is compared to the eight to nine knots ( 15 km / h ) top speed offered by the 37 sails on the wooden masts of @entity3			1
this graphic shows how the two vessels compare in terms of length , crew size , cost and armament the researchers used a @entity110 scanner capable of measuring at a density of 1mm			2
they could then use these high - resolution scans to create detailed images for detailed surface modelling			0
areas of the ship can be enhanced , rotated , labelled and annotated using specialist software at 227ft ( 69 metres ) in length , @entity3 is half the size of the 500ft ( 152 metre ) type 45 , and comprised of eight decks as opposed to @entity39 's 13 levels			1
despite this vast difference in size however , @entity3 had a crew of 850 seamen , while @entity39 's crew only numbers less than a quarter of that , with 190 crew members on board			1
@entity130 , @entity131 at @entity10 said : ‘ being able to use innovative technology to compare these two iconic warships has been fascinating			0
‘ the new research provides an unprecedented level of insight into the power of @entity3 , and life on board			2
part of the 3d fly - through revealed every nook and cranny of the historic ship			0
this scan was taken from on top bowsprit of the @entity3			2
the bowsprit extends 110ft from the ship 's head at 227ft ( 69 metres ) in length , @entity3 ( left ) is half the size of the 500ft ( 152 metre ) type 45 , and is comprised of eight decks as opposed to @entity39 's ( right ) 13 levels			1
despite this vast difference in size , @entity3 had a crew of 850 seamen , while @entity39 's crew consists of 190 members ‘ by comparing the findings of the research with the @entity18 vessels , we can see that over the passage of more than two centuries , @entity163 naval engineering continues to go from strength to strength			1
’ @entity168 , commanding officer of @entity39 , added : ‘ @entity18 is the world 's most advanced warship , just as @entity3 was in its time			1
‘ it is thanks to new research techniques that we are able to look back and marvel at the power of the @entity163 naval forces when @entity3 was in service , and also see just how @entity163 naval engineering has evolved - promising a bright future for our @entity0			1
’ @entity3 has 37 sails flown from three masts and would carry 23 spares during battle ( illustrated ) @entity3 was launched in 1765 at a cost of £ 67,000 in modern - day figures - the equivalent to building an aircraft carrier			1
she was built from 6,000 trees , 90 per cent of which were oak - the equivalent of 100 acres of woodlands			0
the @entity3 has 37 sails flown from three masts and it would carry 23 spare sails during battle			0
the total sail area is 6,510 square yards			0
the @entity195 protrudes 110ft ( 33 metres ) from the ship 's head			0
the @entity203 mast is 182ft ( 55 metres ) above the waterline , the @entity201 mast extends 250ft ( 76 metres ) , the @entity199 mast is 152ft ( 46 metres ) and the main yard is 102ft tall ( 31 metres )			0
a total of 26 miles of cords were used to rig the ship and this was used with 768 blocks , made from elm or ash , were used for the rigging			0
a further 628 blocks were used for the guns			0
many other blocks were carried for the ground tackle , the ship 's boats , storing and spares			0
her top speed is eight to nine knots ( 15 km / h )			1
@entity3 first saw battle in 1778 under admiral @entity225 in the first @entity226 and again two years later in the second @entity226			2
she was also called into action in the @entity229 in 1797 , but she will always be best known for her pivotal role in the @entity231 under admiral @entity2			2
the battle was a decisive victory for the @entity163 but @entity2 was fatally wounded			2
she continues to be flagship of the @entity236 and is the oldest naval ship still in commission - this means if she was needed the @entity0 could sail her into battle			0
this 3d scan shows the @entity3 's famous stern			2
the lines seen on the gallery and along the port and starboard of the ship were based on the design of the @entity249 - launched the same year as the @entity3 , in 1765			0

2014 marks the 209th anniversary of admiral @entity2 's @entity7
@entity10 is undertaking restoration of @entity3 and working with crew on @entity39
the two vessels reveal how @entity163 ’s @entity0 has evolved in two centuries
for example , @entity3 had a top speed of nine knots ( 11mph or *15km/h* )
compared to the ***defender*** ’s 30 knots ( *34mph* or 55 km / h )
850 seamen sailed @entity3 , compared to 190 on board ***defender***
victory cost £ 67,000 to build , while the ***defender*** is worth £ *560* million
