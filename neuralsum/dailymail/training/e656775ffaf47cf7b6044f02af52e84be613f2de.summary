universities were yesterday accused of failing to combat a widespread ‘ lads ’ culture ’ which has seen unwanted sexual advances and jokes about rape become commonplace			1
student leaders warned that harassment was ‘ rife ’ on campus after a survey found that more than a third of female students have been groped or touched inappropriately and almost two thirds said they had heard jokes about rape or sexual assault			1
one university was forced to cancel a ‘ safer sex ball ’ after students were handed free condoms on arrival and footage emerged of two revellers having sex at the party			0
universities have been accused of ignoring a ' laddish ' culture of sexual harassment as a survey has revealed that a third of female students have suffered ' unwelcome advances ' on nights out ( picture posed by models ) another was left embarrassed over a student night promotional t - shirt featuring the phrase ‘ i was raping a woman last night and she cried ’ , while reports have emerged of student publications inviting readers to send in pictures of ‘ top student totty ’ and running ‘ best bum ’ competitions			1
the @entity48 accused universities of failing to do enough to combat the problem and adopting a ‘ not on my campus ’ attitude			1
@entity48 president @entity54 said : ‘ harassment is rife on campus but we still keep hearing from universities that there is no fear , no intimidation , no problem – well this new research says otherwise			1
now i say to universities everywhere – the passing the buck approach of “ not on my campus ” is completely unacceptable			0
students unions and universities must work together to create campuses that are welcoming , safe and supportive to all			2
’ @entity48 president @entity54 has called for an end to the ' lad culture ' on @entity74 campuses as many of the @entity74 's universities prepare to celebrate @entity76 ( file picture ) the survey of 2,156 students shows that 37 per cent of women and 12 per cent of men have been subjected to inappropriate groping or touching			1
almost two thirds said they had heard jokes about rape or sexual assault being made around the campus			1
the survey also revealed a lack of awareness of procedures in place at universities designed to tackle inappropriate behaviour , with 60 per cent saying they were unaware of any codes of conduct written by their university or their students ’ union			0
@entity101 , from the @entity103 campaign , said : ‘ students are experiencing sexism , sexual harassment and assault within the university environment			2
‘ it is worth mentioning that one category of such experiences “ inappropriate touching and groping ” actually constitutes sexual assault under @entity74 law			2
‘ though many students would not label it as such , this normalisation and lack of awareness is a major part of the problem			0
’ however @entity122 , chief executive of @entity123 , said : ‘ where students require support , there are a variety of services on hand to listen to students			0
‘ these include welfare officers , advice centres and university counselling services			0
’ she added : ‘ if alleged criminal behaviour is involved , all universities would support any students reporting such incidents to the police			0
it is important to remember that this is an issue for society generally , not just one confined to university students			0
’ - @entity146 published an article which was called ‘ @entity148 ’ in 2012			1
the piece stated : ‘ think about this mathematical statistic : 85 per cent of rape cases go unreported			2
that seems to be fairly good odds			0
’ - @entity160 ’ @entity159 ’s ‘ @entity158 ’ caused controversy when two students were filmed having sex near the bar			2
in 2011 , its leaflets had a ‘ joke ’ about how many calories a man could burn by forcibly undressing a girl			0
- a poster for a club night at @entity168 showed a t - shirt with the words : ‘ i was raping a woman last night and she cried			2
’ - events company @entity173 ran a night called ‘ @entity76 ’ violation ’ in @entity175 last year			1
the promotional film featured men joking about rape			0
- a @entity181 college ’s rugby club social saw members play a drinking game where they had to complete the phrase : ‘ it ’s not rape if … ’			1

the study was *commissioned* by the @entity48
two - thirds of those surveyed heard rape or assault jokes on campuses
president @entity54 has called for an end to so - called ' lad culture '
