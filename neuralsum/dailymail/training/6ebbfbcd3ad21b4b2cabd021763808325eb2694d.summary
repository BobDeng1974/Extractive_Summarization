of all dramas that is predicted to happen on a wedding day - a massive swarm of bees is certainly not one of them			1
a bridesmaid 's top priority is to make the bride 's day as seamless as possible but for @entity10 it was all about causing an unexpected drama last saturday			1
the 32 - year - old had just finished getting her hair done in a @entity15 salon , in western @entity16 , when she went out to her car to discover that the boot , which had her dresses , shoes and jewellery for the big day , was covered in hundreds of bees			1
' i did n't know if i was going to make it to the wedding , ' she said			2
' there were more flying towards the boot and i was standing there			0
' a man reluctantly helped by driving the car around a few blocks in the hope that the bees would fly off but to no avail			1
' he gave back the keys and said " good luck " , ' she told @entity54			0
' i said to the other bridesmaid that she needed to be brave and jump in the car with me			2
' they went to a service station to go through a car wash only to discover that they had both left their purses back at the salon			0
@entity10 described the bizarre debacle as ' surreal '			2
' i was saying " this ca n't be happening right now - this is just ridiculous " , she said			0
as fortune would have it - on their way back to get money they saw a man hosing down a truck at a concrete mixing company and begged him for help			0
' he took one look at it and walked away and we thought he was n't coming back but then he returned with a bigger and more powerful hose and i was back in time to get my makeup done , ' she said			1
' the bride kept calling for updates and when i walked back in the salon we all laughed and said " this could only ever happen to us " , ' she said			0
