by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:23 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 05:00 est , 25 june 2013 @entity3 ’s top politicians are not as well - known as they might like to think			1
a damning new poll reveals the public can not correctly name most of the @entity6 or party leaders – with hilarious results			1
labour leader @entity9 suffers the indignity of being mixed up with @entity11 from @entity12 while chancellor @entity13 is confused with @entity15 actor @entity14 and home secretary @entity16 is mistaken for comedian @entity17			0
@entity18 : only 77 per cent of people could name @entity9 ( left ) with most confusing him with brother @entity20 , and some thinking he was @entity11 from @entity12 ( right ) recognition : @entity21 received a boost from the poll which showed 94 per cent of people correctly identified him , but it was only just ahead of his rival @entity26 who had 91 per cent recognition pollsters gave more than 8,000 people photographs of 10 of the country ’s most high profile politicians and asked them to name them			1
@entity21 was recognised by an impressive 96 per cent of people , with 94 per cent able to name him			1
pollster lord @entity34 said : ‘ this is as close to a unanimous response as you get in political research , but still means that more than one in twenty of our fellow countrymen and women could in theory bump into @entity21 and not be at all sure who he was			1
‘ this ought to be a salutary thought for those in the political world who imagine that the rest of the electorate follow events in @entity53 as closely as they do			1
’ but in a worrying sign for the prime minister , his great rival @entity26 was almost as well known			1
the mayor of @entity59 ’s appeal stretches beyond the capital , recognised by 94 per cent of people			2
it means he was as well - known as the foreign secretary , health secretary and the defence secretary put together			0
@entity15 : chancellor @entity13 ( left ) was correctly named by just 62 per cent of people , with the rest muddling him up with @entity9 and actor @entity14 ( right ) but the results were less reassuring for the other big beasts of @entity53			1
eighty - nine per cent of people said they thought they knew who @entity72 leader mr @entity9 was – but only 77 per cent got it right			2
two and a half years after his surprise victory in @entity72 ’s leadership contest , mr @entity9 is still most often confused with his brother @entity20			0
humiliatingly , the @entity72 leader was also mistaken for @entity11 from @entity12			0
funny : @entity16 , the home secretary , is the most powerful woman in @entity3 politics , but only 55 per cent of voters know who she is , with some thinking it was comedian @entity17 @entity85 leader @entity84 was less well known than mr @entity9 , despite spending three years as deputy prime minister			0
just 72 per cent of people named him correctly , with most muddling him up with chancellor @entity13			1
mr @entity84 was also mistaken for businessman @entity88 from @entity89 show @entity91 ’s @entity90 the idea that politicians are all the same even seems to extend to their faces			2
hard man : foreign secretary @entity96 ( left ) was mixed up with tv actor and presenter @entity97 ( right ) mr @entity13 was confused with mr @entity9 as well as @entity99 star @entity14			0
foreign secretary @entity96 , correctly named by 64 per cent , was confused with cabinet colleague work and pensions secretary @entity100			2
the bald former @entity102 leaders are in good company – mr @entity96 was also wrongly identified as tv hard man @entity97			2
as home secretary @entity16 is the most powerful woman in @entity3 politics , and in recent months has made little secret of her leadership ambitions			0
but only 55 per cent of people questioned knew who she was , with most confusing her with @entity72 ’s deputy leader @entity109			1
more worryingly , some thought she was stand - up comedian @entity17			0
security : defence secretary @entity112 , recognised by just 10 per cent of people , was mistaken for @entity115 founder @entity114 ( right ) confusion : deputy prime minister @entity84 was recognised by three - quarters of people while the rest confused him with chancellor @entity13 and @entity119 star @entity88 ( right ) education secretary @entity120 is seen as one of the big stars of the coalition , pushing through major reforms of schools			1
but only 29 per cent of people knew he was , mixing him up with @entity128 leader @entity127 and @entity129 , a minister in @entity131 ’s government			0
health secretary @entity132 fared even worse , correctly named by only 18 per cent , with most thinking he was former althete and @entity135 chief @entity134			0
oddly some named him as @entity136			0
defence secretary @entity112 suffered the indignity of being confused with @entity115 founder @entity114 by some of the 90 per cent of people who had no idea who he was .			0

pollsters asked people to look a photographs of politicians and name them
9 out of 10 people correctly identified @entity21 and @entity26
but the results will make for grim reading for the rest of our top *mps*
lord @entity34 *'s* poll questioned 8,051 people between 26 april and 6 may
