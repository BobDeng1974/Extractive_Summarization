although the boy has been taught by his parents to always wear a seat belt , @entity62 sometimes would allow her kids to tuck the shoulder strap under their arms for comfort			0

when @entity60 took her eyes off the road for a moment to change the song on her @entity80 , she lost control of the car and crashed it into a culvert in @entity84			0

major trauma : chance fracture was first described in 1948 by @entity108 radiologist @entity107 as a flexion injury of the spine recipe for disaster : drivers and passengers risk serious injury by tucking the crossover seat belt strap under their arm ( right ) for comfort because in case of a crash , the impact would propel their unrestrained upper body forward ‘ the doctors compared the fracture in his back to cutting a loaf of bread in half - a clean break , ’ mrs @entity60 told the newspaper			1
the traumatic spinal fracture is named after @entity107 , a @entity108 radiologist who was the first to describe this type of lumbar injury in 1948			2

since the accident , @entity150 has been on a mission to share her son 's story in order to raise awareness of seat belt safety			0
‘ i truly hope it encourages everyone not to wear their seat belt like that and to keep an eye on their kids when they buckle up , too , ’ @entity3 said .			0
