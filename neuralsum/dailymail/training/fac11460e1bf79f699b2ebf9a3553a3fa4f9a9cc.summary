whatever else gets said about @entity2 , he certainly has an acute sense of timing			1
not only because he claimed @entity5 is unfairly treated by referees having just watched him collect a booking for diving but also that he did so while @entity9 , the latest official in question , was nearby			1
it led to a rather amusing scene in a @entity14 corridor following @entity16 ’s win			1
@entity5 broke his four - game barren run by scoring @entity16 's second goal at @entity14 @entity5 ( left ) is booked by referee @entity9 at @entity14 on saturday against @entity20 3 - @entity16 have now had three bookings for simulation this season - the most in the @entity23 ahead of @entity24 and @entity25 ( both two )			1
@entity2 had just been asked if he was frustrated about @entity5 ’s treatment by officials , a follow - up question to his earlier assertion that only two of the @entity33 striker ’s seven yellow cards this season - two for simulation - were warranted			1
that ’s when @entity2 spotted @entity36 ‘ you have to ask mr @entity9 , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ mr @entity9 , tell the guys please			0
@entity5 is crying because you gave him a yellow card ! and these guys are asking me why			1
’ @entity9 reached into his pocket and offered @entity2 a tissue			2
it was intended and accepted as a light - hearted gesture			2
@entity5 ( centre ) acknowledges his team - mates after securing a victory that keeps @entity16 three points clear but that should not disguise what was a worrying pattern on saturday where two @entity16 players - @entity52 and @entity5 - were booked for simulation and a third , @entity54 , escaped what should have been his second yellow card after an embarrassing tumble in the area			1
@entity20 manager @entity59 was furious about that reprieve , though @entity2 feels he is also entitled to be bemused , such is his belief that @entity5 is the victim of unfair perceptions from his time at @entity64			1
@entity2 said : ‘ i remember two ( of @entity5 ’s yellows ) that are understandable and fair			1
other times he touches one guy and it is a yellow card			0
everything he does is a yellow card			0
@entity20 boss @entity59 speaks with @entity16 's @entity2 as they teams go toe - to - toe at @entity14 ‘ why ? i do n’t know			1
i think when he was at @entity64 he created a certain image and people do n’t believe that he can change			2
people do n’t understand that he is intelligent enough to understand and to change - because he ( has ) changed			2
’ he added : ‘ in @entity98 , normally referees are very good			0
and more than the referees , the fans - they are very fair in that analysis			2
they do n’t like the elbows , the spitting			0
he had lessons on it			0
not just me or my staff , also people like ( @entity88 ) @entity87 , ( @entity89 ) @entity90 - the ones that speak @entity93 well with him and they have his ear			0
’ @entity100 put @entity20 1 - 0 up to match @entity102 's all - time record in the @entity23 of 175 goals @entity100 runs away in celebration after giving @entity20 the lead at the @entity106 on saturday shortly after , @entity9 came over with his tissue			1
@entity2 might have had greater cause to use it over the loss of @entity100 to @entity24 , though he insists it was the right decision to let him go			2
he said : ‘ the project is to prepare for the next 10 years , not for the next year			0
we made the right decision			0
you can argue , “ you have @entity114 and @entity111 ”			0
@entity111 is a striker that is coming to help and support and @entity114 is the best central defender in @entity98 football and it does n’t matter how old he is			0
the nucleus of the team has to be developed			0
if you have a big player like @entity100 we would stop the development of the other guys			0
’ @entity127 is gifted a free header inside the @entity20 penalty area and heads home @entity16 's opener @entity52 ( left ) is booked by @entity9 for simulation - one of two @entity16 players yellow carded for diving the victory was some way short of @entity16 ’s highest standards this season and @entity2 admitted : ‘ i have to agree we have had many special performances this season and in this ( game ) we just had moments			1
’ @entity59 , meanwhile , has accepted he made a mistake in taking @entity145 on loan from @entity67			1
the @entity147 has made only eight appearances and is believed to be training alone in @entity147			0
@entity59 said : ‘ sometimes transfers work out and sometimes they do n’t			2
i ca n’t see there being a future			0
there has been no fall - out - he ’s been omitted from the squad because when you are up against it , i believe you need to show a bit of resilience and unfortunately @entity145 sees it differently			1
’ @entity158 remonstrates with referee @entity9 after @entity54 's apparent dive			0

@entity16 beat @entity20 2 - 0 at @entity14 on saturday
@entity5 and @entity52 were both booked for simulation during match
@entity2 believes @entity5 is being unfairly treated by officials
he believes referees have a ' certain image ' of @entity5 and book him for it
@entity20 boss @entity59 admits @entity145 's loan move has not worked
