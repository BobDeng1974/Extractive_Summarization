@entity0 are considering whether to bid for @entity1 at the end of the season with the @entity5 striker unlikely to stay at @entity6 after his disappointing loan spell at the club			1
but @entity10 , @entity1 's owners , say that they have no concerns regarding @entity1 ’s future as there are plenty of major teams who have contacted them to take the 29 - year - old striker			2
@entity1 has scored just four goals and had just 14 starts for @entity6 since joining in loan on transfer deadline day – and @entity6 are not expected to take up their £ 43m option			1
@entity1 was left on the bench against @entity25 and not even called upon as a substitute @entity1 warms up at the @entity27 with a smile despite his dropping from the starting line - up but @entity10 vice president @entity31 said : ‘ it ’s up to @entity6 to take a decision but i ’m not worried for him because we have interest from other big clubs			1
' sometimes it ’s just little thing that matter in football			0
when the technical quality is there , the mentality is there , sometimes it ’s just the confidence of the coach or just little details			0
we tend to overreact if somebody does n’t do well for a few years			0
‘ had he stayed here – i know he wanted a bigger challenger and @entity6 is a great club – one of our problems is efficiency in front of goal			0
if he was here we would not be fourth , we would be first or second			0
’ @entity58 is unlikely to make the forward 's deal permanent and @entity0 are potentially interested @entity1 could n't score against @entity61 in the @entity62 and only has four goals to his name in the red of @entity6 @entity1 will be available if @entity6 do not take up their option			1
his agent is @entity68 , who has a good relationship with @entity0 and the @entity71 giants considered buying @entity1 last summer			2
the forward was named on the bench for @entity6 's 2 - 1 defeat at @entity25 on saturday but was not called upon by manager @entity58			0
it could be farewell for @entity1 at the end of the season as he leaves @entity78 disappointed with his spell			1

@entity1 has *struggled* for form at @entity6 this season
the @entity78 club are unlikely to choose to make his loan permanent
@entity0 are considering a move for the @entity5 striker
