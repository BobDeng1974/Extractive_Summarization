@entity2 's first @entity1 free school is controlled by religious hardliners who ban children from singing or reading fairy tales and force staff to wear headscarves - according to the former head teacher and deputy who claim they were forced to leave			1
@entity12 resigned from his role as head of @entity15 in @entity16 in august , two months after deputy @entity11 stepped down from her post			1
both allege they were ' bullied and sidelined ' by members of the school 's trust , which is predominantly @entity1			2
the school strongly denies the pair 's claims			2
allegations : staff claim religious hardliners have banned singing and fairy tales at the @entity15 , @entity16 but earlier this week , concerns were raised by teachers who complained they were being ordered to wear the hijab – even if they are not @entity1			1
now claims have been made that alongside the strict dress code , the school 's 200 pupils are banned from playing stringed instruments , which are forbidden in the @entity39 faith			1
singing is also forbidden unless it involves islamic faith songs , while youngsters are not allowed to read fairy tales as these are ' non-islamic '			1
a staff member told @entity46 : ' when teaching children the alphabet , you could not associate the letter ' p ' with pig			2
' they added : ' we were told that we could n't read the children a story about a witch because it 's seen as being non-islamic			0
' other staff have highlighted ‘ concerns ’ over the school 's practices , which include banning non-halal food and forcing female pupils as young as four to sit at the back of the class away from boys			1
claims : a @entity1 member of staff from @entity15			1
some other members of staff are claiming they have been asked to wear headscarves female members of staff , some of whom are not @entity1 , say they have been told to sign new contracts which force them to wear the hijab			1
these also ban them from wearing jewellery on the school ’s premises in @entity16			2
one woman , who had been interviewed for a position , claimed she was told she was not allowed to shake hands with male teachers to avoid ‘ insult ’			0
another staff member , speaking anonymously to the @entity86 , said the school was ‘ like being in @entity89 ’			0
she said : ‘ girls are treated very separately from boys , the girls sit at the back of the classroom			2
‘ boys go and eat first at lunchtime and then the girls are allowed to go			0
‘ it is like being in any school in @entity89			0
that is why it was founded , that is the idea			0
’ the decision to make all female members of staff , regardless of religious beliefs , wear the @entity39 headscarf – which covers the head but not the face – was apparently introduced over the summer			1
but some female members of staff have been spotted removing the headwear immediately after stepping out of the school building during their lunch hour			2
and around half a dozen teachers at the free school , who could face losing their jobs if they refuse to comply with the rules , are now seeking legal advice from the @entity120			1
regional @entity120 officer @entity121 said : ‘ we are very worried about the school and the education of the 200 children there			1
‘ there are worries over practices concerning the discrimination between male and female pupils in the school , with the girls being told to sit at the back of the class regardless of whether they can see the board properly			1
' he added : ‘ it ’s one thing to have a dress code which we can challenge and quite another to build it into a contract			0
‘ the school is publicly accountable so there needs to be a greater level of transparency			0
’ as a free school , @entity144 operates outside local authority control but still qualifies for government funding			1
it was set up in september last year			0
@entity149 , branch secretary of the @entity150 , said the new demands stem from the @entity144 ’s free school status			1
a hijab is typically worn by a @entity1 female beyond the age of puberty in the presence of adult males - it covers the head and chest , but not the face			2
it not only refers to the physical body covering , but also a state of mind , where al - hijab refers to ‘ the veil which separates man or the world from @entity170 ’			0
@entity171 can also be used to refer to the seclusion of women from men in public			0
most often , it is worn by @entity1 women as a symbol of modesty , privacy and morality			0
if differs from a burqa , a veil that covers the entire body head and face , and the niqab which covers the entire head and face except for the eyes			0
she said : ‘ we have always had a number of concerns about this school ever since it was first set up , as essentially they can do what they like			0
‘ there is no buffer between them and the state and no protection for staff and pupils			0
‘ free schools set their own rules , curriculums and dress codes , and so long as pupils and staff are aware of them before joining , then there is no upset			2
‘ but forcing people to agree to contractual changes or face being out of work could breach employment law			0
’ former head teacher @entity12 , who left after less than a year in the post , previously said the school would ‘ honour all faiths ’			1
however he admitted that he thought at least half of the school ’s pupils would be @entity1			0
the school ’s acting principal @entity223 , who began his job on september 5 , denied claims of bullying towards his former colleagues			0
he also disputed that there was anything within staff contracts requiring women to wear the hijab or a headscarf			1
however , he added : ' the expectation for female staff , raised in adverts and interviews , is that the head is covered while on site			1
to date , no complaint has been raised with the governing body relating to female staff wearing the hijab or headscarf			1
' banned : non-halal food is thought to have also been banned at the school , some of which is based in @entity247 in @entity16 , pictured .			2

@entity12 , former head of @entity15 in @entity16 and former deputy @entity11 claim they were ' sidelined ' by the school
staff also claimed religious hardliners banned children from singing or reading fairy tales
claims come just days after female staff allegedly told to sign new contracts which force them to wear the hijab
employees say they are ' concerned ' by other practices including forcing female pupils to sit at the back of the class away from boys
as a free school it is government funded by outside local authority control
@entity120 is ' very worried ' about the school
