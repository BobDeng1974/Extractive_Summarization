robots may well replace factory workers over the next decade , but they do n't pose a serious threat to middle class jobs , claims billionaire venture capitalist @entity4			1
venture capitalist @entity4 , who co-founded @entity6 and was early backer of @entity8 , dismissed claims that machines pose an imminent threat to @entity13 workers			1
' middle class jobs in the @entity13 are not threatened by artificially - intelligent robots			1
that 's like science fiction			0
it might happen in 100 years , maybe never , ' he said on tuesday at @entity21 's @entity20			1
robots may well replace factory workers over the next decade , but they do n't pose a threat to middle class jobs for at least one hundred years , claims billionaire venture capitalist @entity4 the @entity27 entrepreneur also said middle class jobs were threatened more by globalization , not technology			1
' i 'm not against globalization , but we should be very clear that that 's the force of pressure on the middle class			1
it 's not this scapegoat called technology , ' he said , reports @entity39			0
new research from the @entity41 released this week claims that the falling cost of industrial robots will allow manufacturers to use them to replace more factory workers over the next decade			1
robots now perform roughly 10 percent of manufacturing tasks that can be done by machines			1
the management consulting firm projected that to rise to about 25 percent of such ' automatable ' tasks by 2025			0
in turn , labor costs stand to drop by 16 percent on average globally over that time , according to the research			2
robots now perform 10 percent of manufacturing tasks that can be done by machines , according to the @entity59 , which says this will rise to about 25 per cent by 2025 the shift will mean an increasing demand for skilled workers who can operate the machines , said @entity64 , a senior partner at @entity59			1
factory workers ' will be higher paid but there will be fewer of them , ' @entity64 said			1
the research found a tipping point for installing robots : companies tend to start thinking about replacing workers when the costs of owning and operating a system come at a 15 percent discount to employing a human counterpart			1
for example , in the @entity13 automotive industry , which is predicted to be one of the more aggressive adopters of robots , a spot - welding machine costs $ 8 an hour versus $ 25 an hour for a worker			1
a robot that can perform certain repetitive tasks costs about one - tenth as much as it did more than 10 years ago , @entity64 said			2
costs tied to one commonly used robotics system , a spot welder , are expected to fall 22 percent between now and 2025			0
three - fourths of robot installations over the next decade are expected to be concentrated in four areas : transportation equipment , including the automotive sector ; computer and electronic products ; electrical equipment and machinery			2
certain countries also are expected to be more briskadopters			0
@entity97 , the @entity13 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 now account for about 80 percent of robot purchases and are expected to maintain that share over the next decade 21st century traffic warden : @entity104 showed that images produced droids could give out parking tickets according to dr @entity108 , a research fellow in @entity109 , care for the elderly and even children are among the jobs to be replaced by artificially intelligent beings within the next 50 years			1
her research suggests human workers across a plethora of service sectors and caring professions could be replaced by droids within our lifetimes			2
she believes that as the rapid advances in technology achieved this century are projected to continue at an astonishing rate , this will allow robots to break free of science fiction and establish themselves in our everyday life			2
according to her research - which polled 2,000 people about which jobs they thought were most unpopular and could be among the first to be given to robots for the @entity136 channel @entity135 - traffic wardens ( 65 per cent ) , estate agents ( 40 per cent ) and car salesman ( 33 per cent ) could soon be lost to history			1
by 2025 , robots should be able to handle 30 to 40 percent of automatable tasks in these industries			2
adoption will be slower in industries such as food products , plastics , fabricated metal , and wood products , where many tasks will remain difficult to automate and wages are relatively low			0
thanks to technological advances , however , robots are making greater inroads in these industries as well			2
' regardless of whether it 's time to invest in next - generation robots , manufacturers everywhere should start preparing , ' added @entity64			1
' they need to understand how costs and automation technologies are changing in their industries and what their competitors are up to			0
@entity165 warning : professor @entity166 says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence @entity169 has been described as a threat that could be ' more dangerous than nukes '			0
now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including @entity175 and @entity166 , have signed an open letter promising to ensure @entity169 research benefits humanity			0
the letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future			2
the document , drafted by the @entity183 , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind			0
the authors say there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity169 research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society			0
it highlights speech recognition , image analysis , driverless cars , translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research			0
' the potential benefits are huge , since everything that civilization has to offer is a product of human intelligence ; we can not predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools @entity169 may provide , but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable , ' the authors write			0
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of @entity169 had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak			0
for instance , in the short term , it claims @entity169 may put millions of people out of work			0
in the long term , it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming .			0

dismissed claims that machines pose an imminent threat to @entity13 workers
said it could be 100 years before middle class jobs are threatened by artificially - intelligent robots
new research claims falling cost of industrial robots will allow manufacturers to use them to replace more factory workers over the next decade
