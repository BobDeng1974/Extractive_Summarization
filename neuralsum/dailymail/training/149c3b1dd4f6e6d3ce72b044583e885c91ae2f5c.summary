the asteroids would cause catastrophic damage , on a city - sized scale or larger			1
research from the @entity5 has identified the countries most likely to be worst hit			1
they have identified for the first time those which will suffer catastrophic loss of life or be so crippled it will be almost impossible for them to recover			1
@entity15 's @entity14 has sampled 107 ' potentially hazardous ' asteroids near @entity17 - 330ft wide or larger - to make estimates about how many are out there - and the figure is a terrifying 47,000			1
@entity15 's @entity14 has sampled 107 ' potentially hazardous asteroids ' - @entity22 - as shown in this diagram illustrating their orbits crossing @entity17 @entity15 's @entity26 project has identified 47,000 potentially hazardous asteroids the @entity29 survey now estimates there are 47,000 ' potentially hazardous ' asteroids			1
the top 10 countries most likely to be affected are , in in no particular order : the @entity22 - potentially hazardous asteroids - have the closest orbits to @entity17 's , coming within five million miles and they are big enough to survive passing through @entity17 's atmosphere and cause damage on a regional , or greater , scale.the new results come from the asteroid - hunting portion of the @entity29 mission , called @entity26			1
the project sampled 107 @entity22 to make predictions about the entire population as a whole			0
findings indicate there are roughly 4,700 @entity22 , plus or minus 1,500 , with diameters larger than 330 feet			2
so far , an estimated 20 to 30 percent of these objects have been found			0
scientists have also drawn up a league table of the countries which will be worst affected in the event of an asteroid strike			1
they have identified for the first time those which will suffer catastrophic loss of life or be so crippled it will be almost impossible for them to recover			1
the list has been compiled by researchers from the @entity59 using software called called @entity61 , short for @entity15 's ‘ neo ’ or @entity63 programme			0
overall the top ten countries most at risk are : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , the @entity5 , the @entity70 , @entity71 , the @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			2
' the @entity26 analysis shows us we 've made a good start at finding those objects that truly represent an impact hazard to @entity17 , ' said @entity80 , program executive for the @entity81 at @entity82 in @entity83			0
' but we 've many more to find , and it will take a concerted effort during the next couple of decades to find all of them that could do serious damage or be a mission destination in the future			2
' ' the @entity26 analysis shows us we 've made a good start at finding those objects that truly represent an impact hazard to @entity17 , ' said @entity80 , program executive for the @entity81 at @entity82 in @entity83 the @entity22 - potentially hazardous asteroids - have the closest orbits to @entity17 's , coming within five million miles and they are big enough to survive passing through @entity17 's atmosphere and cause damage on a regional , or greater , scale the new analysis also suggests that about twice as many @entity101 as previously thought are likely to reside in ' lower incination ' orbits , which are more aligned with the plane of @entity17 's orbit			1
asteroids with lower - inclination orbits would be more likely to encounter @entity17			1
they would also be easier to reach			0
the results therefore suggest more near - @entity17 objects might be available for future robotic or human @entity110 at @entity15 's @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity113 ' everything we can learn about these objects helps us understand their origins and fate			0
our team was surprised to find the overabundance of low - inclination @entity22			0
because they will tend to make more close approaches to @entity17 , these targets can provide the best opportunities for the next generation of human and robotic exploration			0
' the discovery that many @entity22 tend to be bright says something about their composition ; they are more likely to be either stony , like granite , or metallic			0
this type of information is important in assessing the space rocks ' potential hazards to @entity17			0
the composition of the bodies would affect how quickly they might burn up in our atmosphere if an encounter were to take @entity26 results have been accepted for publication in the @entity29 spacecraft scanned the sky twice in infrared light before entering hibernation mode in early 2011			0
it catalogued hundreds of millions of objects , including super-luminous galaxies , stellar nurseries and closer - to - home asteroids			2
the @entity26 project snapped images of about 600 near - @entity17 asteroids , about 135 of which were new discoveries .			2
