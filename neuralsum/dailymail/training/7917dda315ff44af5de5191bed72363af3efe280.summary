from supernatural strength to an unfortunate taste for human blood , vampires have long enjoyed a terrifying reputation			1
but according to a pair of real life @entity7 vampires @entity9 , 53 , and @entity10 , 27 , who both hail from @entity14 , the reality of vampiric living is somewhat different			1
although they do sleep during the day and drink blood , the married couple insist that they would never take it unasked ( ' that would be assault ! ' says an outraged @entity9 )			1
' you do n't know whether they have infections either			2
' we do n't sleep in coffins - we do n't even have a coffin			1
we do n't walk around with fangs either ; in fact , we do n't have false fangs			0
' they do , however , enjoy a drop of blood or two with most coming from volunteers who have been dubbed ' @entity59 ' by the vampire community , or from each other			2
' too much blood would make you vomit , ' adds @entity9			1
' it 's not like in a film where it 's dribbling down your chin			0
' it 's personal too			0
it 's always done one on one			0
we drink blood about twice a week but we do eat other food as well , especially red meat			1
' @entity9 , who says he uses a little razor rather than fangs to extract blood from his wife , is at pains to point out that not just any blood will do			1
' @entity59 have to get a health certificate or [ drinking blood ] is like @entity80 , ' he continues			2
' you do n't know what they 've got			0
also , we do n't hack people up , that 's not what we 're about			2
anyway , you 'd be arrested if you did that			0
' other vampiric myths that @entity9 and @entity91 are keen to quash include any suggestion that they ca n't enter churches and do n't have a reflection			1
they also say that far from being forcibly turned into a vampire as shown in films and tv series such as @entity100 , the process happens via what they describe as a ' gentle awakening '			1
' it can happen at any age , ' explains @entity9			1
' it 's a calling			0
you realise that you do n't feel like everyone else			0
' you start asking questions and waking up to who you really are			0
it 's a way of looking inside yourself and yes , you do lose people when it happens			2
' we 're doing this interview to educate people , ' he adds			2
' it 's your choice whether you believe in what we say or not			0
' supper : the pair say they are happy to eat human food and only take blood from each other community : the couple run a group for fellow vampires and say there are many more than you might imagine given that the couple closely resemble goths and have little in the way of fictional vampires ' supernatural powers , are they surprised that people question their credentials ? ' we do encompass the gothic culture			1
and we may well look like gothic people			2
it 's always been there with the culture , the music , the artwork , ' ripostes @entity9			1
' the vampire extends to goths but there are people in our community who have mainstream looks			2
it 's not necessarily a look that everyone wants			0
there could be someone three seats down from you who is a vampire and you would never know about it			0
' much like the ' normal ' appearance of the vampires in @entity100 and @entity165 then , although @entity9 says he 's far from impressed by the latter			1
good stuff : @entity9 and @entity91 are fans of @entity100 which they say is - in some respects - accurate ridiculous : twilight by contrast is well wide of the mark and bears little resemblance to the couple 's lives ' @entity100 is very good but @entity165 is not , ' he says			1
' no we do n't sparkle			0
again , it 's not the true story			0
it 's not my world			0
' nevertheless , the couple say they would like more people in their world and hope that in time , people will become more accepting of their lifestyle			1
' i 'd like people to understand that we 're real and that we 're here to stay , ' says @entity9			1
' we 're not horrible or evil and we want acceptance for what we are			0
' acceptance that there is a different way of living			0
people should be more open minded			2

@entity9 , 53 , and @entity10 , 27 , from @entity14 say they are vampires
the couple say they want other people to be more accepting of them
although they do drink blood , they only take it from each other
say that many of the myths associated with vampires are completely *wrong*
while they do like @entity100 , they say @entity165 is well wide of the mark
@entity100 : the final season is out on *blu* - ray and *dvd* on the 10th *november*
