a teenager has been jailed for life after he stabbed a man to death outside an off licence in a row over a cigarette			1
@entity7 , 18 , was found guilty of murdering 26 - year - old @entity8 after he stabbed him twice in the chest when an argument erupted in an alleyway in south - east @entity12 last year			1
mr @entity8 had been on a night out with friends , where they had spent the early evening drinking and gambling , before making their way to the off licence at about 9.30pm on august 10 , 2013			1
guilty : @entity7 ( left ) , 18 , has been jailed for life after he stabbed builder @entity8 ( right ) twice in the chest a court was told mr @entity8 collapsed on the pavement some 20 seconds after he threw the first punch - when a youth asked him for a cigarette			1
@entity7 , who was just 17 at the time of the fatal attack , denied the charges at the @entity32 but was told by judge @entity33 he would serve a minimum of 18 years in prison			1
he said : ' this is yet another example of an utterly needless and unjustified waste of a human life from a senseless decision by a teenage boy to put a knife in his pocket before leaving home			0
' as is so often the case , that knife was not taken out with any intention in the defendant 's mind to use it to cause anyone serious injury , still less to kill			0
' @entity50 did break out , he did take out the knife and inflicted fatal wounds with such force they penetrated the aorta of @entity8			2
' his family lost a brother and son who was much loved for all his faults			0
i accept @entity8 was not completely blameless			2
his attitude was aggressive and he was clearly worse for drink			0
' however the evidence does not establish the defendant was provoked , rather he was too ready to see @entity8 's behaviour as an invitation to fight			2
' the use of a knife can never be described as a reasonable defensive response to a punch			2
' he continued : ' this murder was neither planned nor premeditated but arose , as so often the case in the context of street violence , in a matter of moments			0
' that fact makes it all the more tragic that a human life was lost simply because a knife was needlessly carried and so what would have begun and ended with the trading of a few punches instead led to a murder			0
' sentencing : the @entity32 heard that mr @entity8 had been on a night out with friends when a youth outside an off licence asked for a cigarette			1
a row erupted and resulted in mr @entity8 being stabbed in the chest he added had @entity7 , who wore a grey tracksuit and appeared impassive in the dock , been a month older at the time of the attack , the sentence would have been much more severe			1
his co-defendant @entity96 , 18 , was acquitted of the same offence last week on the direction of judge @entity33			0
yesterday , prosecutor @entity100 told the court that @entity7 had a series of past convictions for violent crimes , including muggings , dating back to when he was 12 or 13 years old			1
an impact statement from mr @entity8 's mother , @entity107 , said : ' his death was totally unnecessary and i know nothing is ever going to bring @entity8 back			1
' the only thing i can hope for now is the person responsible gets their just desserts			0
' nothing can ever replace @entity8			2
he was funny , outgoing , he had a good heart and would do anything for anybody			0
' at the opening of the trial , mr @entity119 told the court : ' @entity8 was 26 when he was killed in august last year			1
his death was as sudden as it was violent and wholly unnecessary			0
' another life taken away in an instant by the use of a knife that was taken on to the street for no reason			0
' at about 9.30pm that evening he was outside an off - licence in @entity130 , south - east @entity12 , with a group of friends			2
' they were all heavy drinkers and had spent the early evening drinking and gambling at the bookies nearby			0
' he said ' words were needlessly exchanged ' between @entity7 , his friend @entity96 and the victim and his friends which led to a fight in a nearby alleyway			1
mr @entity119 went on : ' @entity8 played his part by being unnecessarily confrontational and he appears to have thrown the first punch , but there was absolutely no need or justification for what happened next			1
' @entity7 took out a knife that he had in his jacket and he lunged at @entity153 twice			2
he stabbed him twice in the left side of his chest			2
' @entity157 blow could have killed him			0
one penetrated the aorta and the other penetrated his heart			0
' twenty or so seconds after he threw the first punch , @entity8 collapsed on the pavement , where he died			1
' following the sentencing , detective chief inspector @entity163 said the murder ' had its origins in a fairly minor verbal confrontation '			0
' @entity7 stabbed him in an instant with a knife that he decided to take on to the street that day for no reason or justification , ' she said			1
' @entity8 's death was wholly avoidable and came about through @entity7 choosing to carry a knife			1
' i hope that the sentence today will act as a deterrent if someone is considering taking a knife or weapon out with them			0
my thoughts are with @entity8 's family and friends			1
