@entity0 has made a quick - fire u-turn to support the @entity2 , after coming under fire for claiming they were ‘ a bit s * * * t ’			1
the @entity7 sprinter appears to have had a change of heart less than 24 hours after he reportedly criticised the @entity10 event , claiming ‘ the @entity11 were better ’			1
after watching the @entity7 netball team lose to @entity14 yesterday , the 27 - year - old claimed the @entity2 were in fact ‘ awesome ’ and dismissed his earlier alleged negative remarks as ‘ all lies ’			1
he apparently told a @entity27 reporter that he was ‘ not really ’ having fun at the @entity2 before branding them a ‘ bit s * * * ’			1
however , while the six - time @entity11 champion yesterday denied making the comments , the paper has stood firmly by its story			1
it today published the full transcript between journalist @entity44 and the athlete , with @entity47 editor @entity46 declaring : ‘ we stand by this story 100 per cent			1
’ either way , there has already been a backlash – with talk that fans would turn their backs in protest when @entity0 competes in the 4x100m relay heats tomorrow			2

olympics were better kg : really , how ? @entity70 : ( shrugs ) kg : where are you off to now ? @entity70 : to do some business one called him a ‘ disgrace ’ , while @entity90 tweeted : ‘ as someone who plays in a @entity10 pub band , i fear @ usainbolt may be about to discover what it is like to lose the @entity10 audience			0
’ the alleged comments also risk angering @entity99			0
@entity0 made a reported £ 2million when he signed a 2012 sponsorship deal with @entity101 , which is also sponsoring athletics at @entity103			1
but the sprinter , who is seeking his first @entity2 gold , tweeted yesterday : ‘ i ’m waking up to this nonsense ... journalist please do n’t create lies to make headlines			1
’ his agent also claimed the reports were ‘ utter rubbish ’			0
however , there was no sign of a backlash when , in a carefully stage - managed appearance , he turned up to support the @entity7 netball team – with crowds of fans clamouring to take a photo as he waved his country ’s flag from the stands			1
the @entity2 has often been dismissed as one of the least prestigious athletics championships			2
faced with potentially disastrous criticism , the @entity127 said it was ‘ pleased ’ with @entity0 ’s response			2
@entity10 2014 spokesman @entity130 added : ‘ i think he woke up to the story like everyone else			0
his tweet says it all			0
’ however , while the world - record holder was quick off the blocks to distance himself from any criticism of the host city , there are hints that his fellow teammates may be feeling less than enamoured with the @entity10 weather ... and its food			0
there are suggestions that some @entity7 athletes may be struggling to appreciate the @entity47 city , where the sunshine of the early days of the @entity2 has been replaced by chill winds and drizzle			1

‘ it does n’t taste like home			0
we want to see more chicken			0
we always want to see more food			0
’ he added : ‘ the weather is tough for us			0
