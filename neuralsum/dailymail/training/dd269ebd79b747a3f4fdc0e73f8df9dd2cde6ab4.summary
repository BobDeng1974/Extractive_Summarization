' for those of us who 've been in the first - team for a long time and come through the ranks at the club , captaining the first - team is a lifelong dream , another step in your career , proof that you 're still improving as a player , although on the flip - side , it means you 're getting older			2
' captain : @entity30 , a product of @entity4 's academy , is the new club captain after @entity6 retired success : @entity30 has won every major competition available to him with both @entity35 and @entity4 @entity36 , who had been the vice-captain , also left @entity4 this season after spending his entire career at the club			1

@entity5 's @entity4 promise to be a different animal to that of the last few years , with considerable upheaval in terms of squad members			2
