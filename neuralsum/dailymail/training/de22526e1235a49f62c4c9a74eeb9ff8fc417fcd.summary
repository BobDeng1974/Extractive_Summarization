hands off in the box is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box			1
whether it is wrestling , grappling , shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the @entity10 vs @entity12 match - the area has become a free - for - all for cheating			1
and that means fewer goals in the @entity16			0
for too long , referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring			0
it 's time to end that			0
so join us in our campaign to say @entity24 to players and referees			0
we ’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it			0
it was more like a @entity34 @entity33 match than a game of football			1
in the red corner , @entity10 's @entity38 and @entity37			1
in the blue corner , @entity12 's @entity41 and @entity40			1
as the whistle blew , all hell broke loose			0
@entity38 took @entity41 out the equation with a headlock , wrestling him to the ground with a throw a judoka would be proud of			1
@entity37 grappled with @entity40 , managing to twist his arm around the @entity12 defender 's neck before dragging him to the ground			1
@entity40 bellowed out , imploring referee @entity54 to award what appeared to be an obvious penalty			1
but @entity54 shook his head , the ball flew across goal , the danger passed			1
2 - 0 to the red team			1
both grapples , by the letter of the law , should have been penalties as the subsequent replays made painfully apparent			2
if this @entity34 behaviour - a headlock , for goodness sake - had happened anywhere else on the pitch , there would have been no hesitation			1
so why is this rough and tumble going unpunished in the penalty box ? @entity77 , or actual bodygrabbing in most instances , inside the box must be stamped out			2
referees and assistants need to toughen up - surely they can see this stuff happening ? why do n't they intervene every time ? yes , there have always been dark arts in the penalty area			1
pinching , nudging , shirt - grabbing , an unkind word in the ear			2
but this is an escalation			0
this penalty box incident caused controversy in sunday 's @entity10 vs @entity12 clash - on the left , @entity40 wrestles with @entity37 while on the right , @entity41 grapples @entity38 @entity37 appears to blatantly pull down @entity40 in the penalty area as the free - kick is taken @entity40 is holding on to @entity37 after being dragged down in the area by the @entity10 defender the @entity12 defender appeals to @entity54 shortly after the incident but a penalty is not given we are getting to a situation where set - pieces in football resemble a ' down ' in @entity107			1
certain players do n't even watch the ball , they concentrate on a man			2
the aim is not to clear the ball , it 's to block off the run of their opponent			0
managers will be getting out the playbook soon			0
and if referees are willing to let this grappling and wrestling continue , then managers will continue to actively encourage it as a defensive tactic			0
it would be shameful if this kind of thing is being coached			0
the football authorities managed to clamp down on reckless challenges from behind			0
players know these will result in a yellow or red card , there is no advantage to be gained			0
@entity12 defenders @entity41 and @entity40 go to ground after they were held in the box this reverse angle shows @entity38 push @entity41 to the floor while @entity37 can be seen with his arm around the neck of @entity40 in the background you could argue it should be two penalties			1
it ’s not just @entity37 on @entity40 , you 've got @entity38 on @entity41			1
the two have virtually got them in headlocks			0
from @entity54 ’s position he should see this			1
you can tell by @entity40 ’s reaction ; he ’s not just appealing — he ’s going berserk			1
the @entity10 ones are worse than @entity154 ( versus @entity155 ) last week			1
now , they must eradicate bodychecking in the box by encouraging the award of more penalties			1
referee @entity161 did just that in the @entity162 vs @entity155 match last weekend when @entity154 wrestled @entity164 to the ground			1
he had the courage to point to the spot			2
@entity169 's @entity168 has also been punished for grappling inside the box , including for one clash with @entity164 in a match at @entity173 last season			1
but far too many instances still go unpunished			0
there is no consistency on this issue			2
@entity179 reviewed the incident at half - time and showed both @entity41 and @entity40 being held in the box @entity37 can clearly be seen to have his arm wrapped around @entity40 's neck as the ball is delivered @entity41 is half - way to the ground while @entity40 is unable to jump as the ball is fizzed across the issue has been looked at before			1
in @entity192 before the 2006 - 07 season , dvds were sent to every club to highlight fouls in the box that would be penalised			2
@entity198 defender @entity197 conceded four penalties in the first five matches of the season but , after initial success , the enthusiasm petered out			2
some argue that in such congested and claustrophobic situations as free - kicks and corners , you 'd see 20 penalties awarded in every game			1
no , this simply would n't happen			2
the concession of one penalty ( possibly two ) would be a strong deterrent			1
players and coaches would quickly learn the lesson			0
there are ways of defending set - plays without resorting to wrestling moves			2
@entity54 could have set a powerful precedent by punishing either @entity37 or @entity38 and awarding a penalty			1
this was a massive match , which unfolded before the eyes of the whole world			0
@entity162 's @entity154 ( right ) did concede a penalty for this grapple with @entity155 's @entity164 last week the pair clashed in the penalty area and referee @entity161 saw fit to point to the spot @entity169 's @entity168 has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking if he missed the actual incident , then he must have seen @entity40 's impassioned plea			1
he is also linked via earpiece to the assistant , who should have been watching attentively too			0
perhaps we need the additional assistants seen in some @entity242 competitions , surely spotting incidents like this is their purpose ? as with the other infringements and moments of gamesmanship that have plagued the game , action can and must be taken to end this penalty area @entity34			1
the @entity252 simple but effective			0
stop the opposition by wrapping your arms around them and preventing them from moving			0
surprisingly , this is rarely penalised by referees			0
the @entity259 a risky ploy because it ’s a more obvious foul			2
stops the opposition from moving and can also handily obscure their vision of what ’s going on			0
the @entity264 a favourite of goalkeepers , who often feel targeted themselves			0
stops any attacker in his tracks and makes them think twice about challenging for the ball			0
the subtle shirt pull with so many bodies in the box , this can be easy to miss. defenders only need a slight tug to put off an attacker , but that can be more than enough to prevent a goal			0
the tumble and fall an evolution of the bear hug			0
after grabbing a man , defenders can haul them to the ground while making it look like they ’re the ones being bundled over			2
@entity289 @entity37 grappled with @entity40 , managing to twist his arm around the @entity12 defender 's neck before dragging him to the ground			1
@entity40 bellowed out , imploring referee @entity54 to award what appeared to be an obvious penalty			1
but @entity54 shook his head , the ball flew across goal , the danger passed			1
2 - 0 to the red team			2
both grapples , by the letter of the law , should have been penalties as the subsequent replays made painfully apparent			2
if this @entity34 behaviour - a headlock , for goodness sake - had happened anywhere else on the pitch , there would have been no hesitation			1
so why is this rough and tumble going unpunished in the penalty box ? @entity77 , or actual bodygrabbing in most instances , inside the box must be stamped out			2
@entity41 , @entity12 captain ‘ me and @entity40 were double headlocked at every corner			1
’ @entity320 , @entity169 assistant manager ‘ grappling			0
that is the new word is it ? it is the referees ’ interpretation and we ’ll leave it to them			0
that ’s what the referees and the officials are paid for			0
so whatever they decide is grappling , or holding , it ’s in their hands really			0
did i do it as player ? no , i was a winger and did n’t have to mark anyone			0
’ ian wright @entity343 striker ‘ there should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set - pieces			2
it was like @entity350 in the @entity10 area			1
’ @entity352 , former top referee ‘ hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned			2
once fans , managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal , this campaign will have achieved its aims			0
’ @entity289 , @entity343 defender ‘ defenders are checking , blocking , holding , grappling , using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place			1
’ @entity367 , @entity368 manager ‘ in a congested area how can you judge if someone ’s been blocked ? it ’s part of the game and some people are good at it			0
a local @entity388 referee came in and he was asking me about it			2
“ can you show me some blocking techniques ? ” that was great , he was trying to find ways of detecting it			0
the confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free - kicks , but the same wo n’t be given as penalties			1
there has to be consistency			0
’ and the readers of @entity394 ... ‘ it ’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves			0
it ’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players			0
’ @entity402 , @entity403 ‘ to those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties , that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop			0
i ’ve been watching football since the @entity413 and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst i ’ve ever seen			1
’ sir @entity416 , @entity418 like our @entity10 facebook page here .			1

@entity40 and @entity41 were on the ground , appealing for a penalty after being wrestled down during @entity10 vs @entity12
but referee @entity54 did n't see fit to award a spot - kick
yet last week , @entity154 committed a similar foul on @entity164 and referee @entity161 awarded a penalty
there needs to be consistency as this @entity34 - style behaviour *creeps* in
awarding penalties for blocking would be a sure - fire deterrent
