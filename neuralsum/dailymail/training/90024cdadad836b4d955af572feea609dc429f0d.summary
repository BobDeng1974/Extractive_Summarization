by @entity0 low self - esteem : @entity2 told @entity3 his hair loss affected his confidence like many men in their thirties , @entity2 was unhappy about his thinning hair			1
desperate to save his receding hairline , the father - of - three , from @entity10 , sought help from his gp			1
speaking on @entity14 's @entity3 , he said : ' i became paranoid about my appearance so i went to my family doctor and expressed my concerns about my hair loss			1
' the doctor performed blood tests to rule out thyroid problems , and mr @entity2 was recommended @entity23 - an @entity24 approved drug , also known as finasteride			1
it works by stopping the conversion of the hormone testosterone to dihydrotestosterone ( @entity31 ) , which is thought to be the active hormone in hair loss			1
he was told that there was a 2 per cent chance among users of sexual dysfunction - but this side effect would disappear if he stopped taking the medication			1
after forking out around £ 90 for a course of the pills , he began taking the drugs			0
but within about six weeks he says he began to have ' strange thoughts '			0
' i started to feel quite withdrawn from my usual social activities such as playing football , watching my local team play , going out with friends , ' he explained			0
' i tended to spend more time indoors and i just felt low in mood generally			2
' his relationship then came to an end - something he blames on the insecurity he felt , due to his hair loss			1
he said : ' in the early part of 2013 i started to pay attention to my hair loss again and that 's when i decided to go back on the @entity23 again			1
' it was at around this time that @entity2 met a new girlfriend , @entity61			1
he said : ' i remember speaking to @entity61 before i bought the @entity23 the second time and telling her i was concerned about my hair loss			1
' @entity2 and his former girlfriend @entity61 , who is now pregnant with his child ms @entity61 , also appearing on this morning , said : ' i said " why would you want to do that ? " i did n't understand why he 'd want to do that when he had a good head of hair			1
' despite this , he continued taking the medication - but this time around the side effects were much more intense			2
' i had n't noticed any changes , sexually , the first time around , but this time it was horrific , ' he said			2
' it started with the onset of insomnia , where i did n't sleep for a week			0
i had to go to my family @entity78 to get medication to treat my insomnia			0
a study found that men who take the hair loss drug finasteride , also known as @entity23 , can experience prolonged periods of low libido			1
dr @entity87 , assistant professor of medicine at @entity89 , discovered that 94 percent of men taking finasteride developed low sexual desire , 92 percent suffered from erectile dysfunction and 69 percent experienced difficulty with orgasm			1
the study , to be published in the @entity97 , is the first to show that symptoms persisted for at least three months in otherwise healthy men , even when they stopped taking the drug			0
it ’s thought the drug alters levels of important brain chemicals called neurotransmitters that affect mood and other bodily functions			2
' when i was trying to be intimate with @entity61 i was practically impotent and i remember more or less waking up one morning and i had no connection between my brain and my genitals - it was unbelievable			2
speaking to @entity112 earlier in the week , he said : ' my penis is totally different in size and girth			0
' it ’s much shorter and thinner			2
it now functions about ten per cent of the time with @entity119			1
' every time me and @entity61 tried to make love , my head said yes but down there i felt nothing			0
i felt like a failure , like less of a man because i could n’t seem to make love to my own girlfriend			0
' talking to @entity130 and @entity131 , he said : ' i was in a whirlwind of mixed emotions			0
i did n't know what was going on with me			0
at that point i decided to inform my family that i 'd been taking this medication			0
' they took me to seek help through my family gp and despite coming off the medication , and having only taken it for three weeks i started to get really , really low , very depressed			0
' ' a crisis team was called to my home and they decided it was a good idea to go into a psychiatric unit voluntarily , which i felt i needed because i could n't keep myself safe			0
' i could n't function , i could n't look after myself			0
i just did n't know why i was feeling so abnormal			0
' despite @entity2 ’s impotence problems , the couple , who broke up two months ago were shocked to discover in january that @entity61 was pregnant			2
@entity2 told @entity112 : ' we still love each other and we ’re having a baby together but at the moment i just need to focus on getting my head around what ’s happened			1

@entity2 , *36* , from @entity10 , took over the *counter* pill @entity23 for hair loss
told that there was a two per cent chance of sexual dysfunction
he then experienced low moods , depression and says his penis is much thinner and shorter and only functions 10 per cent of the time - with @entity119
