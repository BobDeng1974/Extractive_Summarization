a spokesman said : ' measures are being taken and everyone is looking at the situation but one week after the event is too early to make any decisions			0
as a result of the currency surge holidaymakers who had booked in @entity1 have reportedly been racing to change their travel plans with many hoping to switch to @entity79 where they can pay in @entity81			1
some speculators have even suggested that the currency surge could even spell the death knell for the @entity85 altogether			0
in a bid to keep the tourists arriving , the @entity25 tourist board reportedly sent an email to all 1,100 local businesses with advice ranging from reinstating the 1.20 franc per euro cap , offering discounts of 20 per cent or cutting prices by 10 per cent , according to @entity95			1

@entity103 , who lives in the resort of @entity105 on the @entity1 - @entity107 border for 30 years , told the @entity108 : ' we live and rely on winter tourism and since the @entity1 central bank stopped the exchange rate cap we have n't really known what to think – everyone is doing their own thing , introducing special offers to ensure it does n't become too expensive for tourists			2
' visitors should n't hesitate to ask for discounts because we are really having to sell ourselves now as well as offering the very best quality and service			0
' tourists from @entity124 accounted for 37 percent of overnight stays in 2013 , according to latest data from the @entity1 statistics office , but the country will be out of reach for many after ' @entity131 '			2

the franc 's abrupt surge comes weeks before @entity124 school half - term breaks which mark the height of the ski season ‘ the original forecasts predicting growth once again in the @entity1 tourism industry over the next two years probably wo n't stand up any more , ’ @entity166 , ceo of the @entity1 hotel association hotelleriesuisse , told @entity168			2

in @entity190 ski resorts , the economic chill has worsened in the past year as the number of @entity193 visitors fell sharply due to @entity195 's standoff with the @entity196 over @entity197 and because of a weaker @entity193 rouble			0
tourism from @entity200 has also been hit as the yen weakened			0
an even bigger test for the mainly small businesses in the hotel and restaurant industry could come during the summer			0
