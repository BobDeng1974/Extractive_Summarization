a new series starring @entity6 , of the @entity7 , tells the story of three young men who build a suicide machine and offer the ' service ' to those who wish to end their lives			1

criticism : @entity14 mp @entity20 , left , has criticised the @entity0 for a new sitcom starring @entity7 actor @entity22 , right , which makes a joke of assisted suicide @entity20 , mp for @entity25 , told the @entity26 : ' it is a sad fact that assisted dying is now regarded as a ' revenue stream ' to some foreign clinics and clearly as a matter of fun by some parts of the @entity0			1
' the six - part black comedy , called @entity35 , was written by @entity36 , a veteran comedy producer who has contributed to @entity37 from the @entity38 in one scene of the programme , due to air on @entity44 this month , the lever of the machine is pulled to deliver a fatal dose , killing @entity6 's next door neighbour in seconds			2
