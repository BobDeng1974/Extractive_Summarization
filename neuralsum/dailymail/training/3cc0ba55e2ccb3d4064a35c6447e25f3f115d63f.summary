by @entity0 as a teenager , @entity1 despised the reflection staring back at her in the mirror			1
she refused to pose for photographs , covering her boyish frame in baggy t - shirts and shunning the pretty dresses and strappy tops her friends wore			2
her confidence was shattered when doctors revealed her twisted spine was the result of the medical condition scoliosis			1
but now 23 , miss @entity18 has transformed her image , after years of being forced to wait for the life - changing surgery she could only have once fully grown			1
@entity1 suffered scoliosis , a severe curvature of the spine , as a teenager , leaving her body twisted and one leg considerably longer than the other ( left )			1
today the 23 - year - old finally feels comfortable posing for photos after surgery to transform her body ( right ) and to top her new look off , the customer services agent , had a boob job to boost her chest from a @entity36 to a @entity37 , giving her the feminine curves she has always dreamed of			1
miss @entity18 's scoliosis was so severe that one leg grew shorter than the other and her shoulders and ribs protruded at different angles			2
she said : ’ once i hated my body so much i could n’t bare to look in the mirror			2
now i love it and i ’m incredibly proud of what i ’ve been through to be able to say that			2
' it 's been rebuilt and i 'm delighted with the results			0
' my condition stopped me feeling attractive for many years			0
but now after the operations i could not be happier			0
' my friends and family call me @entity56 but it was the implants that really gave me the figure i craved			0
' miss @entity18 , from @entity60 , @entity61 , was in her teens when she first began to notice her shape was at odds with her peers			0
she said : ‘ my back was stooped and then i noticed my rib cage seemed twisted			2
’ over time , her condition got worse and she noticed one leg was longer than the other			2
doctors told @entity18 she would have to wait for corrective surgery until she had fully grown			1
in july 2009 surgeons inserted iron rods into her spine ( right ) to straighten her spine , ( left before surgery ) she said : ‘ like most self conscious teenagers i kept myself covered up all the time to try and hide the irregularities in my shape			1
' finally she confided in her parents who made an appointment with their gp			0
miss @entity18 was examined and referred to a specialist who confirmed she was suffering with scoliosis , an abnormal and severe curvature of the spine			1
it was so extreme that one leg had grown longer than the other to compensate for the twist in her frame			2
' my back was stooped and then i noticed my rib cage seemed twisted ... i felt very unattractive and could n't wait to have surgery ' - @entity1 but consultants at the @entity99 in @entity100 were hopeful that @entity18 would benefit from surgery			1
the solution was an operation to insert iron rods into her back to straighten it			1
but doctors revealed , much to miss @entity18 's despair , that the operation could only be performed once she had stopped growing			0
she said : ‘ i understood why , but it was awful being told that basically i would have to spend the remainder of my teenage years feeling unhappy and unattractive			0
' while my friends wore pretty dresses and strappy tops i kept covered up in baggy clothes			0
i felt very unfeminine and unattractive and could n't wait to have surgery			2
' finally in july 2009 she underwent the nine - hour operation and , after a week in hospital , spent three months at home recovering			1
to complete her transformation @entity18 went under the knife once more , for a boob job to boost her chest from a @entity36 to @entity37			1
she said : ' i waited a long time and went through a lot to get here but i love my appearance ' she was astonished to learn she had grown three inches as a result of the successful operation , going from 5ft 6ins to 5ft 9ins			1
miss @entity18 said : ‘ it was fantastic but i knew straight away i was n’t finished			0
after waiting so long i was determined to look more curvy and feminine			0
’ so she decided to complete her transformation with a boob job to boost her from a @entity36 to a @entity37			1
she had a consultation with a surgeon from @entity135 who agreed to operate and she took out a loan to cover the £ 3,500 cost			0
' i waited a long time and went through a lot to get here but i love my appearance now			1
i spent my teenage years hidden away so i 'm making up for lost time ' - @entity1 on her transformation miss @entity18 said : ‘ the staff at transform were extremely sympathetic with regards to my medical history and i felt the surgeon really understood why it was so important to me to have the operation after what i had been through			2
’ following the operation last march she says her confidence has finally blossomed and she can at last enjoy being photographed			0
she said : ‘ i built this body for me , nobody else so i do n’t care what anyone thinks			0
i waited a long time and went through a lot to get here but i love my appearance now			1
‘ i can walk into a shop and pick up anything i like knowing it will fit and look nice			0
i threw out all my baggy clothes and now i love tight stuff and bikinis			0
‘ i spent my teenage years hidden away so i ’m making up for lost time			0
