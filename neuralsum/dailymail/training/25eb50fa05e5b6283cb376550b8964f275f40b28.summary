by @entity0 published : 17:18 est , 16 september 2012 updated : 04:09 est , 17 september 2012 @entity2 target : prince @entity3 walks the asphalt by an @entity6 helicopter at @entity7 , @entity8 prince @entity3 will continue his deployment to @entity10 despite the @entity2 assault on the camp where he is based			1
the attack came at the start of a weekend of bloodshed in the warzone			0
five @entity18 soldiers were injured and two @entity19 killed when 15 insurgents armed with @entity22 assault rifles and rocket - propelled grenades stormed the allies ’ supposedly impregnable fortress @entity7			1
the 28 - year - old prince , serving as a co-pilot gunner in the @entity29 ’s @entity6 helicopters , was a mile and a half from the firefight on friday night			0
he was taken by @entity34 bodyguards to a secure location in the 20 - square - mile base			1
the prince – known as captain @entity38 in the @entity29 – was ordered to wear body armour and carry a loaded gun while the three - hour battle raged against @entity2 fighters dressed in stolen @entity44 uniforms			1
the attack happened during a bloody 72 hours of escalating violence across @entity10 in which coalition troops were killed by their supposed local allies : during friday ’s attack on @entity7 , all but one of the @entity2 raiders were killed , but not before they destroyed six @entity44 harrier jump jets and three refuelling stations			1
it has prompted a major review of security to find out how the insurgents managed to penetrate the heavily - fortified base			1
the @entity2 claimed the attack targeted prince @entity3 , who arrived in @entity10 with @entity62 , @entity63 , 11 days ago			1
they also said the assault was revenge for a @entity44 - made film that insults the prophet @entity67			1
but a senior @entity29 source said the attack appeared to have been planned for weeks – before it was known that @entity3 was going to war			0
‘ they are linking the attack with captain @entity74 ’s presence for propaganda , ’ he said			0
‘ after saying this attack was mounted in reaction to the video on @entity82 , it is entirely predictable that the @entity2 have changed their tune to say it was aimed at @entity74			2
’ ushered to safety : when the attack on the base began , prince @entity3 was ordered to don body armour , load his weapon and was taken to a safe place by @entity34 bodyguards military chiefs refused to withdraw @entity3 from the warzone , insisting his presence did not increase the risk to himself or his comrades			1
a @entity97 spokesman said : ‘ the deployment of captain @entity74 has been long planned and the threat to him and others around him thoroughly assessed			0
’ major @entity101 , a former infantry officer and editor of @entity104 , warned against ‘ playing into the hands of the @entity2 ’			1
he said : ‘ on balance it is a difficult equation but i think he should be kept there			0
if we take him away the @entity2 will crow that they have just scored a major victory			1
‘ it would affect the morale of the troops on the ground if prince @entity3 was taken out just because there was a threat			2
’ on deployment : the 28 - year - old royal arrived in @entity10 with @entity62 , @entity63 , 11 days ago			2
military chiefs have insisted his presence does not increase the risk to his comrades pilot : @entity3 is trained to fly @entity6 helicopters , some of the most deadly aircraft in @entity10 colonel @entity127 , a former commander of @entity18 forces in @entity10 , said : ‘ i do not believe that @entity3 ’s presence in @entity10 increases the threat to our troops			1
‘ obviously if they did succeed in getting him it would be a major coup for them , but even that risk is worth taking for the benefit of having a member of the royal family fighting with our soldiers			2
‘ his presence there boosts morale of our men and shows that we as a nation are unafraid			0
’ meanwhile , two soldiers from the @entity151 the @entity150 were lured to their death by a traitor @entity10 policeman , it has emerged			1
the uniformed man pretended to be injured at a checkpoint in the @entity159 - e @entity158 district of @entity8 on saturday			2
but as the patrol approached him , he shot and killed them			2
he was killed in return fire			2
the number of @entity165 soldiers killed in so - called ‘ green on blue ’ attacks stands at more than 50 for this year alone , including nine @entity18 soldiers – about a quarter of the @entity18 ’s dead since january			1
it also emerged that an @entity10 police officer shot and killed four @entity44 troops at a remote checkpoint in the south of the country yesterday			1
the killings followed the death of lance corporal @entity177 , of the @entity178 , who was killed in @entity159 - e @entity158 on friday after his vehicle hit a roadside bomb			0
the 32 - year - old , from @entity183 , was described as an ‘ outstanding soldier in every respect ’			0
in another blow for the @entity188 , @entity10 officials claimed a @entity165 airstrike killed eight women and girls as young as ten as they gathered firewood before dawn in the eastern province of @entity196			1
@entity165 initially said 45 insurgents and no civilians were killed in the attack , but a spokesman later said it was investigating the allegations			1
by @entity0 @entity202 had fallen on @entity7 and prince @entity3 was relaxing with fellow @entity204 pilots			0
some were reading , others chatting			0
all were enjoying their ‘ down - time ’ amid the hectic schedule of flying missions against the @entity2			2
suddenly the peace of the @entity10 night was shattered as a terrifying message boomed from the tannoys dotted around the military fortress			2
‘ @entity7 is under ground attack , ’ a voice repeated , calmly but urgently			0
troops were ordered into what the military calls ‘ lockdown ’ – a carefully rehearsed plan to deal with emergencies			2
with a member of the royal family in their midst , other contingencies also kicked into action			0
like his colleagues , captain @entity38 donned body armour and a helmet and picked up a loaded firearm			1
but he was then quickly escorted by a team of specially - assigned @entity34 bodyguards to a secure location in the camp			1
his fellow @entity6 pilots and other specialist crews were also kept in lockdown in safe areas , although without the @entity34 bodyguards			1
military chiefs have drawn up detailed plans on how to respond to keep the 28 - year - old officer safe in the event of attack			0
it is understood that on this occasion , however , it was not necessary to trigger the absolute worst - case - scenario procedure			0
a source at @entity7 said : ‘ there was no messing about			0
@entity3 was taken straight to the safe place as soon as the alarm went off			1
he was ready for a fight and would have taken on the @entity2 but he had to follow the plan			2
‘ if anything happened to him it would have been a disaster			0
’ base : @entity7 is the @entity18 headquarters in @entity8 ( file photo ) security : an armoured vehicle patrols on the periphery of @entity7 , where insurgents where able to blow a hole in the wall before launching an attack on @entity18 and @entity44 forces even though @entity3 and the @entity6 crews were a mile and a half from the attack , they could hear the rattle of machine gun fire , exploding rocket - propelled grenades and the crump of mortars			1
a few minutes earlier , shortly after 10pm local time on friday , insurgents had launched the raid on @entity7 , the sprawling and supposedly impregnable desert headquarters in @entity8			0
disguised in stolen @entity44 military uniforms and armed with @entity22 automatic rifles and rocket - propelled grenade launchers , 15 @entity2 split into three teams for the attack			1
it is believed one insurgent detonated a suicide vest , blowing a 5ft hole in the 30ft - high perimeter fence that rings the camp			0
this allowed the rest of the enemy fighters to stream into the 20 - square - mile fortress , which includes @entity294 , home to the @entity29 , and @entity296 , the main @entity297 base in @entity8			0
the raiders evaded surveillance and attacked the south - east of the camp , where the @entity19 have their air base			0
described as ‘ well equipped , trained and rehearsed ’ , the enemy began attacking @entity44 warplanes and helicopters			2
prize target : fifteen insurgents , working in three teams of five , managed to destroy six @entity44 av - 8b harrier jump jets and three refuelling stations			2
all but one died in the attack when challenged , the insurgents shot dead two @entity19			1
as the alarm spread , 50 troops from 5 @entity314 ( 51 squadron @entity315 ) , the @entity316 , sped to the battle in light armoured vehicles			0
the gun battle continued for three hours			0
six @entity44 av - 8b harrier jump jets and three refuelling stations were destroyed			0
by the time the firefight ended , around 1am local time on saturday , 14 insurgents lay dead			0
