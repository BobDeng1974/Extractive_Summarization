a new survey of retired @entity3 players ' brains has found signs of a degenerative disease in what is heralded as the first evidence of early detection in former players while they 're still alive			1
until now , chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity12 ) had not been spotted in the brains of players until after their death			1
such was the case with former @entity3 linebacker @entity18 , who was found to have the disease - which can lead to dementia and behavioral problems - months after he committed suicide in may			1
@entity3 players who suffer repeated head injuries in the course of their professional careers could be more prone to @entity12 , but it has been reported in other athletes and members of the military			1
an autopsy showed he suffered from a degenerative brain disease after 20 seasons in the @entity3 scientists at @entity46 used a new image technique to analyze the impact of head trauma on the brain health of five retired @entity3 players			2
results from the scans , known as positron emission tomography ( @entity56 ) , show the accumulation of abnormal tau protein , which can indicate the onset of future brain disease			0
the tau proteins are believed to be connected to @entity12 and alzheimer 's disease			2
' this is the first time we have done these @entity56 scans in @entity3 players who are retired , ' dr @entity63 , @entity46 ’s @entity65 professor on aging and a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the @entity69 at @entity46 , told @entity74			1
degeneration : another recent study of @entity12 shows a comparison between normal brain tissue , left , compared with that of an @entity3 player , center , and a 70 - year - old former boxer , right dominating : seau , right , was one of the most feared linebackers in football ' so it 's the first time to show what we think are these tau protein deposits			1
what 's extraordinary about that is the patterns of the deposits were identical to patterns in @entity12 , which is only diagnosed through autopsy			2
the logical conclusion is that 's what we ’re seeing - suggestive this is the first time we 're visualizing @entity12			1
' chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with cognitive and behavioral problems later in life and can eventually cause dementia			1
also known as punch drunk syndrome , it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions			0
in recent years , @entity12 has been shown to exist in other athletes , including professional and college football players and pro hockey players			1
sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss , aggression , confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or many decades later			0
to test the brain imaging scan , dr @entity63 injected a chemical biomarker called @entity123 , which attaches to the tau proteins , into the brains of the five former athletes			2
this allowed scientists to identify which sections of the brain had higher levels of @entity123			0
scans revealed that the more concussions the athlete had experienced , the higher levels of tau protein were discovered			0
@entity18 was a star linebacker for 20 @entity3 seasons with the @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 before retiring in 2009			2
he died of a self - inflicted shotgun wound			0
an autopsy on the athlete showed he suffered from the brain disease			0
he joins a list of several dozen football players who have had @entity12			2
@entity12 often impacts a person 's behavior with symptoms including depression , suicidal thoughts and memory loss			1
' there are other connections here that are relevant , ' @entity63 said			0
' recent studies have found that @entity3 players have a four times greater probability of dying from @entity161 's than the general population			0
' in other studies , if you look at people , not just athletes , but people in general who ’ve had a concussion that has led to an hour of unconsciousness - it doubles their risk of @entity161 ’s			0
' long term impact : scientists are analyzing the impact of head trauma and brain disease in former @entity3 athletes ( stock photo ) watch video here			0

@entity46 survey finds signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in brains of living subjects for the first time
@entity12 has been found in *numerous* former athletes , including @entity18 , who killed himself last year
@entity12 most commonly reported in professional athletes and members of the military .
