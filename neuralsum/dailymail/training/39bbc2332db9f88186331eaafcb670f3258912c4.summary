@entity1 captain @entity0 was in buoyant mood as he linked up with the rest of the squad for the first time since being named captain			1
the 28 - year - old was named as @entity9 's successor last week , which would have topped off a exciting few weeks for the @entity11 forward , after just recently being made captain for his club side			1
just 10 outfield players were deemed fit enough to take part in @entity1 's first training session since their disappointing @entity18 campaign			0
the @entity1 medical team will assess the four players before deciding whether any replacements are needed ahead of wednesday 's friendly against @entity46			1
@entity1 manager @entity34 is already without 12 senior players so he will be hoping for no more withdrawals			0
@entity28 , @entity39 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 all undertook light recovery sessions indoors because they played for their respective clubs on sunday			0
threesome : @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 trot on together during the @entity1 training session on monday close control : @entity19 keeps the ball in close proximity to thwart the challenge of @entity74 and @entity75 hold off : @entity19 uses his strength to sustain the challenge from @entity78 midfielder @entity19 in an @entity1 training session at @entity40 experience : @entity20 will be hoping to replicate the sort of form he showed on the domestic stage last season for @entity1 the other 13 players , including goalkeepers @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity66 , trained as normal on a wet morning at @entity78 's @entity88 training base			2
@entity1 , who finished bottom of their @entity18 group , face @entity46 at @entity92 on wednesday and then fly to @entity93 five days later to take on @entity94 in their first @entity96 qualifier			2
as a result of @entity1 's poor @entity18 showing , the @entity97 are expecting a record low crowd of between 35,000 and 40,000 at @entity92 on wednesday .			0

@entity0 trained with @entity1 for the first time since being named captain
the 28 - year - old has also recently been named captain of his domestic side @entity11
