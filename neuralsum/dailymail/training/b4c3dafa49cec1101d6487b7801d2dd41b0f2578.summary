by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the @entity2 has denied claims by @entity5 finance secretary @entity4 that they have had talks on the future currency of @entity5 the @entity2 has denied claims made by a senior @entity5 minister that they have discussed arrangements for a currency union if @entity5 becomes independent			1
@entity14 yesterday issued a statement slapping down comments made by @entity5 finance secretary @entity4 on wednesday			1
in a post on the @entity19 ’s website , mr @entity4 said : ‘ the @entity5 government has had technical discussions with the @entity2 regarding out proposal for a currency union and we welcome their continued acknowledgment that the bank will introduce whatever the politicians decide			1
’ but in a humiliating rebuke , the @entity2 said : ‘ to be clear the @entity2 has not entered into discussions with representatives of the @entity5 government about proposals for future monetary arrangements in @entity5			2
’ insiders said there have only been discussions about how the @entity2 dispenses its existing powers			0
this is the second time the @entity2 has been forced to give a public dressing down to mr @entity4 , who joined the @entity19 at the age of 15			2

the @entity2 issued a statement shortly afterwards saying no such discussions had taken place			2
the issue of a formal currency union - - in which an independent @entity54 continues to use the pound and agrees to the sovereignty of the @entity2 to set interest rates - has become a highly politically charged issue			1
chancellor @entity60 and treasury secretary have both insisted it is ‘ wrong ’ to suggest there would be a currency union if there is a ‘ yes ’ vote in the referendum on september 18			1
but mr @entity4 described this as the ‘ scaremongering and threats of @entity47 politicians ’ in his statement on wednesday			2
describing a currency union as a done deal , he said : ‘ the @entity75 is clear that an independent @entity54 will use the pound and we will do so in a currency union			1

he also offered reassurance that the @entity2 would stand behind @entity5 based banks , at least during the 18 month period between the referendum and ‘ independence day ’ next march			1
speaking at the @entity89 press conference on wednesday , the @entity87 said : ‘ in terms of financial stability questions – whatever happens in the vote – the @entity2 will continue to be the authority for financial stability for some period – certainly over the interim period			0

those affected could include @entity114 - based @entity113 and @entity115 if they choose not to move their registered headquarters south of the border			0
last night mr @entity4 came under fire from @entity119 , the former chancellor and head of the @entity122 campaign against @entity5 independence			2
