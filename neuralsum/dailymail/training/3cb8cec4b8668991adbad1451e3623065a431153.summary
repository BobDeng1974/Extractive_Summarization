by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:06 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 11:07 est , 11 december 2012 giving workers shares in their companies in return for losing some employee rights could cost £ 1billion , it emerged today			1
@entity8 has been warned his ‘ shares for workers rights ’ plan will leave a big hole in @entity13 coffers at a time when other parts of government are clamping down on tax avoidance			1
critics accused the chancellor of putting ‘ another billion pound lollipop on the table ’ which could be used as a tax dodge			2
chancellor @entity8 , who joined children to paint a money box at a @entity25 at @entity26 , has been warned his ' shares for rights ' plan will cost £ 1billion today mr @entity8 was hosting his annual @entity25 in @entity26 for children 's charity , @entity32			1
earlier the @entity33 raised concerns about a ‘ number of uncertainties ’ surrounding the plan to give staff a tax break on profits they make on shares awarded under the scheme			1
the idea is already deeply controversial in government , seen as a spin - off from a plan by venture capitalist and @entity50 donor @entity49 to slash employee rights to encourage firms to hire more staff			2
announcing the policy in his conference speech , mr @entity8 said it was a ‘ voluntary three - way deal ’			0
chancellor @entity8 announced his ' voluntary three - way deal ' for employees in his party conference speech in october ‘ you the company : give your employees shares in the business			1
you the employee : replace your old rights of unfair dismissal and redundancy with new rights of ownership			0
and what will the government do ? ‘ we 'll charge no capital gains tax at all on the profit you make on your shares ... owners , workers and the taxman , all in it together			0
’ but in documents published by the @entity33 , it has emerged that desk break could cost the taxpayer £ 1billion by 2017 - 18			1
‘ first , it is difficult to estimate how quickly the relief will be taken up ; this could make a significant difference as the cost is expected to rise towards £ 1 billion beyond the end of the forecast horizon , @entity33 costing documents state			2
‘ second , it is hard to predict how quickly the increased scope for tax planning will be exploited ; again this could be quantitatively significant as a quarter of the costing already arises from tax planning			0
’ @entity99 , director of the @entity100 , said the policy of not charging capital gains tax on the shares was at odds with the purported crackdown on tax avoidance , which has seen multinational firms like @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 in the headlines			1
‘ just as it is berating those who have picked up the tax sweeties currently lying around , it is preparing to put another billion - pound lollipop on the table , ’ mr @entity99 wrote in the @entity112 today			2
‘ there may be a case for more flexible approaches to employment legislation			0
but as a tax policy , “ shares for rights ” always looked pretty questionable			2
at a time of increasing scrutiny of tax avoidance schemes , it has all the hallmarks of another avoidance opportunity			1
’ under the plans , employees will be given the choice of a traditional contract or one that does not afford them the usual employment rights			0
the alternative ' owner - employee ' contract will not give the employee rights on unfair dismissal , redundancy , the right to request flexible working and time off for training			0
mothers will be required to provide 16 weeks ’ notice of a firm date of return from maternity leave , instead of the usual eight , in return for shares in their company			0
last week the results of a consultation on the policy showed that from 209 responses only a ‘ very small number ’ thought it was a good idea .			0

employees urged to sacrifice rights in return for shares in their firm
chancellor offered tax break on profits to encourage take up
@entity33 says it could cost £ 1billion by 2017 - 18
@entity100 *condemns* ' lollipop ' at a time when ministers *condemning* other tax avoidance
