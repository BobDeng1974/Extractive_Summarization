a skateboard park has become a laughing stock in south @entity2 after satellite images revealed it had a rather unfortunate design			2
pictures from @entity6 were posted online this week showing that from above the facility in @entity8 is distinctly phallic			1
@entity10 user @entity9 noticed it and posted the picture asking : ' anyone else notice the unfortunate design of the skate park ? ' it led to a flood of responses with others pitching in with predictably wry comments			1
this picture from @entity6 shows a distinctly phallic - shaped skate park in @entity8 , south @entity2 @entity23 noted : ' only in @entity8 would you get a tarmac beach and a c * * * - shaped skate park			1
' it is the latest example of unintentionally suggestive designs being spotted on sites like @entity31 and @entity6			0
but makers @entity32 insist there was no mistake in the construction and the shape is one commonly used in the world of skate park design			0
designer @entity39 said : ' the ' c * * * and balls ' design is a highly functional favourite of skateboarders worldwide and @entity8 is certainly not unique in having its own piece of phallic skate architecture			1
' the fact @entity8 has a version of this classic design is largely due to the input of some extremely well - travelled and experienced skaters in the area			2
' he added : ' i remember the kink in the @entity8 skate park plan was actually introduced to the design at a late stage to try to make it look less phallic			1
the discovery of the skate park follows reports of this unfortunately - shaped housing estate in @entity64 this @entity65 in @entity66 has also hit the headlines for the same reason ' we get these sort of comments a lot , unfortunately certain people seem to get really excited by a giant phallus			2
my response is usually that if yours is that shape you should probably have a chat with your gp ! ' @entity8 resident @entity80 , 53 , was a professional skateboarder in the 1970s and helped draw up the design which he claimed helped ' assist a smoother ride '			2
' most people do n't actually notice the phallic likeness unless it 's viewed from above , ' he added			0
' it consists of four separate entities that all come together in to what 's known as a combi bowl , giving maximum satisfaction to the rider			0
' @entity91 described it as a ' great facility '			1
a spokeswoman said : ' the town council , together with local people and organisations work to ensure that provisions are provided within the town for the residents and visitors in the area			0
' the skate park is an example of the people in @entity8 working together to produce a great facility for both the youth and adults within the town			1
' the town council is extremely proud of this achievement and is delighted that it is still receiving so much interest nearly three years after its completion			0
' the stir comes just months after residents in @entity64 were said to be worried about the value of their homes after it emerged their estate resembles a giant phallus when seen from above			0
and in the @entity120 a @entity65 in @entity66 hit the headlines for the same reason .			0
