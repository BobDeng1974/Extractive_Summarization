an @entity1 woman believes she has secured photographic evidence of the legendary blood - sucking beast , el chupacabra			1
@entity5 , 55 , told @entity6 that she was driving along a @entity8 rural road earlier this month when she spotted the mysterious carcass lying on the ground			1
when she stopped to look at the dead creature , she was disturbed to see it had ' a little truck ' in place of a nose , ' little toes ' and ' hair on its tail '			1
in a bid to document the unusual - looking beast , she whipped out her camera phone			2
' i know it 's something logical , ' @entity5 said , ' i know it 's not an alien , i know it 's not @entity37 's aborted child , like people are coming up with			1
' desperate to unravel the mystery , @entity5 revisited the dead animal			1
as the flesh had rotted away , she took the remaining bones with her			0
strange encounter : @entity5 , 55 , told @entity6 that she was driving along a @entity8 rural road earlier this month when she spotted the mysterious carcass lying on the ground she noted that although the area stunk of death , there were strangely no flies or maggots around			1
wildlife experts who studied the skeleton told @entity6 the bones appear to be from a young dog			1
however , @entity5 insists she stumbled across something far more sinister			1
' i lived a long time in @entity58 and they call it the â€˜ chupacabra ' out there so that 's what we 've been calling it			2
' the legend of the chupacabra dates back to 1995 in @entity68 , where many local farmers claimed to have seen the animal after finding their livestock had been killed			2
left behind : desperate to unravel the mystery , @entity5 revisited the dead animal - as the flesh had rotted away , she took the remaining bones with her			1
bizarre discovery : @entity5 says the images have left people baffled and no - one has been able to identify the bloated and hairless critter explanation : wildlife experts who studied the skeleton told @entity6 they appear to be from a young dog sightings of the animal have been reported throughout @entity58 and much of the @entity87 , particularly in the @entity88 , where it is usually determined that suspected chupacabras are just emaciated , sickly coyotes			1
the description of the chupacabra varies , but typically those who claim to see the animal describe it as being about the size of a small bear , with a row of spines along its back			2
in 2004 , a rancher near @entity102 killed a supposed chupacabra that he claimed had been killing his livestock			0
dna from the animal later revealed that it was a coyote with demodectic or sarcoptic mange			2
in a dozen other cases where the suspected chupacabra 's body has been discovered , dna testing showed that the animal was some sort of wild canine with severe skin disorders , particularly mange			1
legend of @entity113 the word comes from two @entity116 words - ' chupar ' , to suck , and ' cabra ' , goat			2
the first reported sighting was in 1995 , when eight sheep were found dead in @entity68 with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood			0
thus , the legend of the livestock killing , vampire - like chupacabra was born			0
since then , the legendary beast has been spotted across the @entity127 and even the world			0
a @entity130 incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on @entity113 in 2012			0
earlier this year , yet another @entity133 sighting came when a @entity135 man actually shot and killed what he claimed was @entity113			0
even a @entity138 town had a @entity113 sighting this past july science attempts to explain scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be @entity113 are actually wildlife like coyotes , foxes , and stray dogs infested with parasites			1
most commonly pointed to is the parasite @entity150 , which causes mange			0
@entity152 is a painful , potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel , making for an even more ghoulish looking beast			0
in humans , @entity150 causes scabies and a consequent itchy , painful rash as the parasites burrow around , leaving their feces under the skin			0
' goat sucker ' : the legend of @entity113 likely originates from a 1995 case in @entity68 where 8 sheep were found dead with puncture wounds			0
it has been described as hairless , or as having spines along its back , and as having blue or red eyes			0

@entity5 , 55 , said she was driving along a @entity8 rural road earlier this month when she spotted the mysterious carcass
when she stopped to look at the dead creature , she was disturbed to see it had ' a little truck ' in place of a nose , ' little toes ' and ' hair on its tail '
the restaurant worker says the images have left people baffled and no - one has been able to identify the bloated and hairless critter
however , wildlife experts who studied the animal 's skeleton told @entity6 it appears to be that of a young dog
