perhaps when @entity1 leads @entity2 on to the pitch , it will all begin to sink in for @entity4 and their manager @entity5			1
the club ’s cycle of gloom ended last year with a return to the @entity10 and since the @entity13 fourth round draw paired them with @entity4 , this tie has been transformed into a celebration of their survival against the odds			1
here is the happy ending : a windfall of £ 250,000 from the @entity22 and a couple of hours on prime - time @entity24 as reward for those responsible for keeping the club alive when fate conspired against them			1
the @entity29 , home of @entity4 , will host @entity2 in the @entity13 on friday night the sold - out @entity13 fourth round tie with the @entity32 champions has been the talk of the city the rustic surroundings of the @entity29 will certainly come as a shock to @entity4 's pampered stars victory for the @entity40 side would certainly register as one of the @entity13 's most seismic shocks @entity43 will lead his @entity2 side to @entity45 seeking to avoid the @entity13 banana skin @entity1 will lead the @entity2 side at the @entity29 on friday night while @entity4 's expected line - up cost £ 235.5m to assemble , @entity45 were put together for nothing it is an uplifting reminder of the power of the @entity13			1
but @entity52 and his players insist this is not the end			0
they will pour everything they have into trying to beat @entity4 or ( even better from a financial perspective ) take them back to @entity61 for a replay			2
money has already warned his players that shirts swapped with @entity4 ’s megastars after tonight ’s game must be replaced at their own cost			2
a shirt - swap souvenir with @entity71 will cost £ 39.99 at the club shop — unless they can persuade chairman @entity73 to dip into the cash the @entity40 club will earn from the game			1
even if @entity45 are beaten , friday night 's match still represents a triumph for individuals who have made sacrifices during nine years outside the @entity10 — among them @entity82 , a director on behalf of the supporters ’ trust @entity84 , who also draws footballers and sells his sketches to support the club ’s youth system			1
this is the away team dressing room where @entity4 will be housed on friday night the shower room in the away dressing room at the @entity29 the two teams will then make there way through this tunnel and run out before a capacity crowd @entity4 manager @entity5 has been masterminding the downfall of @entity4 all week it wo n't be the most comfortable of nights for @entity2 's substitutes it is a hobby which delivered a distant connection to @entity1 , via @entity105 , the former @entity4 boss who played 86 times for @entity45 from 1983 - 85			1
@entity82 stayed in touch with @entity108 and the pair were in conversation when then @entity112 boss mentioned an exciting teenage prospect about to break through at @entity114			0
‘ he said he ’d earn the club £ 2million , ’ said @entity82 , who sketched the young @entity1 from a photograph			1
he posted the drawing to @entity105 who got the youngster to sign it and send it back			0
@entity82 is now in possession of a very early @entity1 autograph — a spiky scribble in @entity124 beside a pencil sketch of @entity1 in @entity112 blue — and he will go in pursuit of an updated version for a new caricature			0
no one can begrudge a souvenir for the 76 - year - old who sold his lifelong collection of @entity45 memorabilia , dating back to 1947 , for £ 10,000 — less than a third of its estimated value — to save the club when they were in administration and facing a winding - up order			1
@entity82 , who has raised thousands for the club with his caricature drawings of players a selection of @entity82 's drawings - he sells the sketches to raise funds for the club 's youth academy @entity82 's sketch ahead of the fourth round fixture and featuring @entity2 's @entity1 perhaps @entity82 will have the opportunity to present @entity4 manager @entity43 with this drawing when they slid into the @entity154 in 2005 and lost their funding for the youth system , @entity82 started to donate any money raised from his drawings to the club ’s academy			1
wealthy directors like @entity73 and his predecessor @entity162 have dug into their pockets and chief executive @entity164 — the club ’s former manager — launched into a series of fund - raising events			2
‘ i did a couple of walks for our academy when we had no funding , ’ said @entity164			0
‘ i and the centre of excellence manager did a walk from @entity174 to @entity45 when we had lost to them in the play - off final			1
' it highlighted how ludicrous it is that one football result dictates whether your academy gets funding			0
‘ i walked round all the clubs in the @entity154 and then to @entity185 , and that was 420 miles			2
last year i did 26 marathons in 26 days to raise about £ 100,000 for our @entity188			0
chief executive @entity164 embarked on various fundraising challenges to keep @entity45 afloat @entity4 chairman @entity73 oversees the final preparations at the @entity29 ahead of the match @entity4 danger men who will try and stop @entity2 on friday night manager @entity5 had the chance to get up close and personal with the @entity13 trophy this week ' we ran our youth programme through the @entity188 when we were outside the league and we had to fund it ourselves			1
‘ we were determined not to increase ticket prices ( for the @entity4 game )			2
we ’ve charged £ 10 for a kid to watch			0
you think it is a quick win to make a lot of money on the night but in the longer term that does more harm than good			0
' once @entity2 go out of town we ’re back to @entity40 and valuing those supporters again , so we must n't try to exploit the situation			2
we want to make sure fans come back			0
’ @entity4 boss @entity43 is under no illusion about the test his side face , saying : ‘ it is always tough because in the players ’ mind it ’s a weaker team			1
‘ on wednesday @entity220 — the no 1 in the @entity222 — lost against the @entity223 of the second division and it can happen also in the @entity13			2
every ticket has been sold for the big @entity13 tie , sandwiched between @entity45 's usual @entity40 games @entity4 fans @entity229 of @entity230 and his father @entity231 pose with the @entity13 during the @entity232 on the @entity233 these half - and - half scarves are sure to sell well on the night of the big match former @entity2 player @entity236 in training for @entity45 this week @entity45 centre - half @entity238 gets to grips with the famous old trophy ahead of the game @entity45 players @entity238 , @entity243 and @entity244 take a selfie with the @entity13 ‘ there are always surprises and i hope we are not the surprise			1
when you see @entity45 and analyse them , they play very direct with long balls			2
they have five or six players above 6ft 3in tall , so for us it is difficult to defend			0
’ for @entity45 , friday night also represents a reminder to the city authorities — who have been resisting their quest to build a new ground — that the football club is a valuable part of the community			1
‘ it ’s a massive game for the club , ’ said centre - half @entity238			2
‘ it ’s not just the revenue but it ’s @entity2 , a massive club , coming to play at @entity45			1
the city ’s buzzing , everyone ’s been talking about it , trying to get tickets			0
‘ this is my club			0
i used to come and watch as a boy			0
i watched us get relegated out of the @entity10 so to be part of the team that got us promoted last year was a proud moment and this sort of game is a reward for the last 18 months			0
‘ it ’s a sort of happy ending			0
except this is not the ending			0
