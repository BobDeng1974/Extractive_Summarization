the bracelet remains ( pictured ) were found on the second night of @entity6 in @entity7 - once a large settlement during the @entity9 or early @entity11 period the 1,600 - year - old glass piece was hidden in an uncovered box , containing a number of other glass fragments that had been discarded as waste archaeologist @entity25 of the @entity27 holds the base of a large glass bowl that was found in the same refuse pile as the fragment of glass bracelet these 4,000 - year - old @entity58 beads , and worth their weight in gold if you dug these up in your garden , you probably would n't think twice about throwing them away			1
but the unassuming objects are 4,000 - year - old @entity58 beads , and worth their weight in gold			0

another theory is that the bracelet came from a workshop in the area and had been intended for other markets			2
