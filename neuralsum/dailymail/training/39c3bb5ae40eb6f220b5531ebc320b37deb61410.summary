it was a traditional dialect used for centuries by fisherfolk			1
but yesterday it emerged that the language of @entity5 had finally died with the passing of its last speaker			1
@entity8 was the only person still fluent in the age - old tongue of the @entity10 and his death at the age of 92 means it will now exist only in audio recordings			1
end of an era : @entity8 , the last native speaker of the @entity5 dialect , has died aged 92 small talk : @entity8 ( left ) and his brother @entity18 speaking in the old @entity5 dialect at @entity20 in @entity21 , before @entity18 passed away last april mr @entity8 , a retired engineer , said recently he could still close his eyes , see the boats heading out to sea and hear the unique speech pattern – never normally written down – that set his people apart			1
his younger brother @entity18 had been the other surviving speaker – but he died in april last year , aged 86			1
yesterday , dr @entity28 , of @entity30 ’s linguistic department , said mr @entity8 ’s death was highly significant			2
he added : ‘ it is the first time that an actual @entity34 dialect has so dramatically died with the passing of the last native speaker			2
‘ this was always going to be the danger of the @entity10 , as there were so few speakers even when it was healthy , when the fishing was still good			0
language of the sea : the @entity5 dialect was traditionally spoken by fishermen who populated the town on the tip of the @entity10 ‘ so @entity8 ’s passing is a very sad day			1
it was a very interesting dialect and was unlike any of the others			2
‘ there are one or two who still have some facility in the @entity5 fisherfolk dialect but most of the time they speak @entity57			1
@entity8 was the last fluent native speaker who spoke no other tongue from a child			1
he was what we term a “ dense ” speaker			0
so all we have now are the recordings			0
’ mr @entity8 , who died on sunday , had worked across @entity65 , but kept coming back to @entity5			1
his wife @entity66 was a direct descendent of the community ’s most celebrated son , 19th century polymath @entity70			0
but the @entity72 were from the fishing community			0
in 2007 , the brothers were recorded by @entity75 , the project that has created a digital archive of the history and culture of the @entity80			0
mr @entity8 said : ‘ our father was a fisherman and all his folk had been fishermen stretching way back			2
it was the same on our mother ’s side too			0
when we were young , we talked differently in the fishertown to the rest of @entity5			2
‘ it was n’t written down			0
it was an oral culture			0
we had this sort of patois , which i think had both @entity93 and @entity94 in it			0
' there were words , a lot to do with the fishing , which nobody else could understand			0
you hear a smattering in some things people from @entity5 say , but nobody speaks it fluently but for us			2
’ dictionary : a few words from the @entity5 dialect return : mr @entity8 kept coming back to the @entity10 coast and @entity5 village where a few people still have some proficiency in the extinct language			1

@entity8 was the last person still fluent in the fisherfolk dialect
his younger brother @entity18 had been the second speaker of the @entity5 language until he passed away last year aged 86
