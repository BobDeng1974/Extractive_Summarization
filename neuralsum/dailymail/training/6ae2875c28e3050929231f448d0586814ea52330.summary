by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 luckless @entity3 's bid for a fifth pole position in @entity5 literally went up in flames as his car caught fire early in qualifying			1
just minutes into the session at the @entity12 , @entity3 's @entity10 was ablaze at the rear , and although he attempted to crawl back to the garage , it proved a futile exercise			1
@entity3 was forced to stop on the pit lane entry road where marshals quickly used extinguishers to douse the fire , started by what @entity10 claimed to be a fuel leak			1
extinguish : @entity10 driver @entity3 pulls out of qualfying at the @entity5 @entity23 inferno : @entity3 's @entity10 caught fire as he was driving around the @entity12 in @entity26 @entity27 : @entity3 managed to drive around the track and make it to the pit lane before he jumped out of the car cloud : smoke billowed out of the engine as a fuel leak caused @entity3 's @entity10 to catch fire state : @entity38 's @entity10 was badly damaged by the fire as it spread around the rear end of the car @entity42 : @entity3 cuts a frustrated figure as he walks away from his smoking car pacesetter : @entity3 's @entity10 team - mate @entity46 qualified on pole at the @entity12 1			1

@entity3 ( @entity10 ) as the @entity64 looked on , and even though the visor was down on his helmet , you could sense his bitter pain and disappointment as he shook his head disconsolately before trudging away			2
it was yet another brutal blow for @entity3 in his bid to overhaul @entity10 team - mate @entity46 in this year 's battle for the formula one world title			1
to rub salt into @entity3 's wounds , @entity46 secured his third consecutive pole position and will start sunday 's race ahead of @entity48 in his @entity49 and the @entity51 of @entity50			1
in the build up to this race @entity3 had spoken of his desire to enjoy a clean weekend without his errors on one hand , and unreliability on the other			1
but the 29 - year - old must now feel like this may not be his year given the run of wretched luck he has endured this campaign			0
looking on : @entity3 stares at his smoking mercedes as engineers try and extinguish the fire flames : @entity3 drives around a corner of the @entity12 with his engine on fire during @entity97 frustration : @entity3 has now gone six race without a pole position after his withdrawal in @entity26 in a season when @entity10 are dominant , and when their cars do finish a race they are either first or second , @entity3 has so far suffered two @entity105 ( did not finish ) to the one for @entity46			1
that has played a key role in the 14 - point gap between the pair ahead of sunday 's race			1
a forlorn @entity3 , who had been quickest through all three practice sessions , said : ' i bailed out of that timed lap i was doing and i was like " i 'm going to try and do the second lap "			2
' then something happened to my brakes			0
something on the brake system failed , so i had to engage some settings to try and correct it , then the engines died			0
i then thought " i am right next to the pit entry so i will roll back and get them to fix it " but then i looked in my mirrors and it was on fire			2
' i was hoping to get it in neutral so i could push it back or something			0
contrasting fortunes : @entity46 races past @entity3 with the @entity64 's mercedes on fire in the pit lane centre of attention : @entity46 claimed his third consecutive pole ahead of @entity48 and @entity50 re-live today 's dramatic qualifying session with @entity0 ' i was still trying to get it to the garage and maybe they could do something , but they said ' stop , stop , stop ' so i tried to stop , but the brakes were n't working			1
the car kept running forward			0
' the engine was working sometimes and sometimes not working , so it is all pretty bad			0
' i think it 's getting to the point beyond bad luck - it 's something else			0
we just need to do better			0
' as for his hopes for the race , @entity3 added : ' we 'll have to replace the engine and gearbox ( which incur penalties )			1
' but with those it 's a good thing - i ca n't go any further back ( on the grid )			2
' there 's a lot going through my mind , but i just have to try to turn it into positives			0
' i honestly do n't know what i can do tomorrow			0
this is a track where you can not overtake , so i think i will struggle to get in the top 10 or at least the top five			0
helpless : @entity3 can only lean over his mercedes as he watches race stewards attempt to put out the fire facing away : @entity3 looks into the distance as his @entity10 continues to billow smoke in the background ' i will probably leave here more than 20 points behind @entity46 , but there are still races to go			1
i do n't know what to say , i will try my best			0
' the remainder of the session was naturally nowhere near as dramatic , but was nevertheless eventful , particularly when rain began to fall at the start of the top - 10 shoot - out			0
as the drivers attempted to get in a flying lap on slick rubber , the slippery surface proved too difficult to handle , especially for @entity191 who slid off into a tyre barrier at turn one			2
that brought out the red flags for his car to be recovered and for the barrier to be repaired , resulting in an eight - minute delay			0
that period of time was enough for the rain to pass and the track to start to dry out , ensuring the remaining nine drivers could again use slick tyres			0
smash : @entity191 's @entity57 is put on the back of a tow truck following his big crash in qualifying come the conclusion it came as no surprise when @entity46 clinched pole , his sixth of the year and fifth in the last six races			1
@entity46 finished half a second clear of @entity48 , on the front row for the third time this year			1
bottas lines up third , followed by @entity52 in his @entity49 and @entity53 in his @entity54			1
@entity51 ' @entity55 starts sixth , with @entity56 seventh for @entity57 ahead of @entity59 's @entity58 and @entity60 for @entity61 , with @entity191 10th			1
@entity220 starts 11th in his @entity59 , although a spin on his final hot lap in @entity223 denied him the possibility of a place in the top 10			0
poor : @entity54 's @entity227 was knocked out of qualifying in @entity26 for the second week in a row @entity231 pair @entity230 and @entity232 qualified 12th and 14th , with @entity61 's @entity233 sandwiched in the middle			1
@entity236 ' @entity235 is 15th , with @entity237 16th for @entity238 as @entity3 's fire was not the only surprise in @entity26			1
@entity54 misjudged matters that resulted in @entity237 dropping @entity227 down to 17th and out of the session			1
behind the @entity243 will be @entity245 pair @entity244 and @entity246 in 18th and 20th , either side of @entity238 's @entity248			0
@entity3 was placed 21st as @entity236 ' pastor @entity249 retired with a technical fault on his @entity236 just a couple of minutes beforehand			0
neither driver set a time , but both will naturally be allowed to compete , with the penalties for @entity3 meaning the pit lane start , allowing @entity249 to jump up to 21st .			1

@entity3 's engine caught fire and he had to jump out of his car in pit lane
mercedes say that a fuel leak caused the fire on @entity3 's car
he will start the race from the back of the grid after exiting in @entity26
@entity46 on pole ahead of @entity48 and @entity50
@entity3 is 14 points *adrift* of @entity46 in @entity274 's title race this season
@entity54 's @entity227 eliminated in @entity26 with @entity53 5th
@entity57 's @entity191 crashed in @entity97 leading to a red flag
