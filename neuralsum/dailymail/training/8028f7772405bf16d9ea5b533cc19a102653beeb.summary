by @entity0 published : 19:33 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 19:35 est , 12 march 2014 migrants have cost the exchequer £ 140billion since the mid- 1990s – more than £ 22million a day – it was claimed yesterday			1
a new study starkly contradicts left - wing claims that immigration helps to cut taxes			2
think - tank @entity8 has responded to another study – given substantial coverage by the @entity12 last year – which purported to show that immigrants made a contribution of £ 25billion to the public purse between 2001 and 2011			1
migrants have cost the exchequer £ 140billion since the mid- 1990s , more than £ 22million a day , it was claimed yesterday			1
a new study starkly contradicts left - wing claims that immigration helps to cut taxes but @entity8 says it was based on ‘ highly misleading ’ claims and some ‘ wholly unrealistic ’ assumptions			2
it says authors @entity27 and @entity29 , researchers at @entity26 , overstated the likely tax revenues from migrants and under - played the amount they claimed in benefits			2
sir @entity34 , chairman of @entity8 , said : ‘ our report finally disposes of the immigration lobby ’s oft repeated claims that immigration reduces our tax burden			2
' the total cost is high and increased dramatically between 1995 and 2011 , providing no compensation for the overcrowding of this island which we are experiencing , largely as a result of immigration			0
’ ' the study by @entity26 ’s @entity48 suggested that migrants contributed 34 per cent more in taxes than they cost in benefits and consumption of public services			1
but the @entity8 researchers point out that buried in a table at the back of the report , the net fiscal cost of migrants between 1995 and 2011 – the full span of the study – is revealed to be £ 95billion			1
but the @entity26 report used a much shorter period between 2001 and 2011 , when @entity64 saw a huge influx of @entity66 , to conclude migrants had made a net contribution of £ 25billion			1
the figures were based on the assumption that the most recent arrivals contribute as much as long term migrants , despite being younger and on lower incomes			0
it also assumed they paid the same amount of council tax and that foreign workers in agriculture and construction were paying the same in income tax as lawyers and accountants			0
it assumed migrants were taking no more in means - tested benefits than the rest of the population , and they received no more in housing benefit than the @entity64 average			0
using the same methodology as the @entity26 report but its own adjusted assumptions , @entity8 found that migrants in the period 2001 - 11 would have actually cost the exchequer some £ 25billion			1
over the longer period , from 1995 to 2011 , they cost more than £ 140billion			1
the @entity8 study is the second to put a major question mark over the @entity26 research			1
earlier this year @entity102 , @entity103 at @entity26 , said the study was ‘ obviously driven to make the case it claims to have made ’			2
professor @entity27 was one of the academics behind the prediction that only 13,000 migrants from @entity66 would come after controls were dropped in 2004			0
in the event , more than one million arrived in almost a decade			0
last night he said : ‘ the main criticisms by @entity8 relate to three points			0
' the first and second points are unfortunately based on a serious misinterpretation of the methodology we have used in our work , which leads to fundamental mistakes that invalidate their calculations			0
‘ the third point has been already raised by other commentators in the past			0
we have responded to that point in much detail and show that it does not affect the basic conclusions of our paper			0

migrants have cost exchequer £ 140billion since the mid- 1990s , it is claimed
contradicts study they made contribution of £ 25bn between 2001 and 2011
@entity8 study is second to put question mark over @entity26 research
