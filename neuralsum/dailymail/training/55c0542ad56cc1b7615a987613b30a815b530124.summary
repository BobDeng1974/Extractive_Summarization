police have announced that 40 - year - old @entity6 and his 71 - year - old father @entity7 are now presumed dead as they have been missing for a week			1
investigators seem convinced that they have died , even though there was no sign of foul play , the weather conditions were non-threatening around the time they disappeared , and their bodies have never been found			2
missing : @entity15 , 71 , was an avid outdoorsman and was on a week - long trip with his grown son close : relatives say that @entity6 took the trip with his father because he felt it important to do so as long as he was physically able to travel and fish remote : the formal investigation into @entity6 and @entity15 's disappearance came when they did not show up in time for their scheduled flight back to @entity28 on july 29 according to the @entity30 , the father - son duo had been camping in the @entity4 forest last year , and @entity6 was joined by his two bothers to celebrate their father 's 70th birthday			1
when @entity6 , who has twin 3 - year - olds , and @entity7 returned to the @entity38 area of @entity39 on july 21 of this year , they decided that they did not need a guide , but that did not raise any flags as it was a standard move of many experienced adventurers			1
' pursuant to their request , the men were not accompanied by a guide or a third party at the time they went missing , ' @entity45 , the owner of the @entity46 where the @entity47 were staying , said in a statement			2

’ family favorite : @entity6 and @entity7 were staying at the @entity62 when they disappeared , and it was their second time visiting the area as they went last year with @entity7 's two other sons for his 70th birthday last year ( pictured ) the @entity68 only became concerned about the men when they did not show up for their flight back to @entity28 on july 29			1
mr @entity45 said that staff on the grounds last saw the pair earlier that same day when they were fishing close to the lodge			2
staff at the @entity78 , which is known for its trout fishing selection , would not respond to further questions from @entity81			0
investigators found the boat that the @entity47 had been using washed onto shore eight miles down the river from where they had been staying			1
the men 's life preservers were found inside the boat , which their family explained to the @entity30 as being understandable since experienced fisherman use preservers as cushions while they are fishing for long periods of time			1
@entity96 : @entity6 previously posted pictures of his father playing with his children and other relatives missed : @entity6 is the father of twin 3 - year - olds @entity102 ( left ) and @entity103 ( right ) adding to the mystery , the weather conditions did not prove any cause for concern for investigators and the @entity6 family as @entity6 's brother and @entity7 's son @entity111 said that it was ' 72 degrees and sunny ' when they went missing			1
the @entity68 carried out a two day manhunt - in addition to the three - day search operated by the @entity78 owners - that included ground and air searches , but have since called it off and left their case as an open missing persons file			0
' the wilderness got them , ' @entity126 , the operator of the aviation company that the @entity68 used to conduct the search			0

‘ they had a wonderful relationship			0
their lives were intertwined , ' @entity136 told the @entity30			0
‘ for my dad , everything stemmed from a love of family			0
his greatest passion were his grandchilden and sons			0
