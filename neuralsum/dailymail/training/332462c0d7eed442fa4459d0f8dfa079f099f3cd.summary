@entity1 manager @entity0 vowed to stick with @entity2 after another goalless but encouraging display against @entity4			1
@entity2 is still to score in the @entity6 goal since moving to @entity7 after the @entity8 were shut out by the @entity9 in a 0 - 0 home draw			1
but after some underwhelming performances , and controversy in midweek after exchanging shirts at half - time in the loss to @entity16 , @entity2 produced a much - improved effort			1
@entity2 ( left ) tussles with @entity19 ( right ) during @entity1 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity4 at @entity7 @entity2 has an effort at goal but the @entity23 could n't find the back of the net against @entity27 's side he had one of @entity1 's best chances in the first half , forcing a fine save from @entity32 , and was again thwarted by the @entity4 goalkeeper with almost the last kick of the game			1
his work rate and body language were also positive and @entity0 is convinced the controversial @entity23 will come good			1
@entity0 said : ' i thought he worked very well , very hard			1
he maybe thought he was n't going to play today but you have got to stay with it			2
he is working hard and he is doing his best			0
' unfortunately it is that wee bit of confidence sometimes , when you do n't get the goal			0
he kept going , kept getting into the areas			0
' sometimes with players if it 's not going so well they have a day where they do n't train or do n't work , but he puts himself out to train every single day			0
he is out there wanting to be better , wanting to improve			0
@entity8 boss @entity0 believes @entity2 worked hard and tried his best against @entity4 @entity2 is crowded out by @entity54 ( centre ) and goalkeeper @entity32 ( left ) ' goalscorers will tell you they get their energy from the ball hitting the back of the net and it is just not happening for him in terms of that , but all i will ask is they do their best			1
you saw today 's reaction			0
it was unlucky he did n't get the goal			0
' @entity1 showed urgency only sporadically but still created a number of chances and finished the match strongly			1
@entity75 and @entity76 both went close in the closing minutes before @entity2 was denied at point - blank range by @entity32			1
@entity0 said : ' it was a big chance			1
we had one or two of those but we could n't quite put the ball in the net			0
' he will be disappointed he has n't scored but , for the team , it was a big effort on the back of playing against a good team in midweek			0
' we were a bit slow in the first half but in the second half i thought we were outstanding in the energy and effort we put into the game			2
it was a game we should have had three points from			2
' @entity2 takes a breather after being brought down by @entity4 's @entity98 at @entity7 @entity2 's lack of goals was lampooned in a publicity stunt staged by a bookmaker outside the ground , who offered fans the chance to swap shirts bearing the player 's name			1
but @entity4 boss @entity27 was also impressed by the contribution of the former @entity111 forward and feels the criticism has been harsh			1
@entity27 said : ' i thought he was their best player			1
there is a lot written about him and a lot of debate about him and he is not everyone 's cup of tea , but he is a bit of a character , a bit of a maverick			0
when you sign a maverick you have to treat him like one and get the best out of him somehow			0
' he is going through one of those sticky periods but the kid is a talent			0
' @entity27 also praised @entity2 for having the decency to accept a request to swap shirts with one of his players , despite the furore of wednesday night			1
' it is a shame for him			0
he is the whipping boy , ' @entity27 said			1
' but even then he was good - spirited enough to swap shirts			2
so , one of them have got it , but he did it out of the road of the cameras this time			0
' @entity4 boss @entity27 believes @entity2 was @entity1 's best player on saturday afternoon @entity27 was pleased to have collected another good point after last week 's draw against @entity152			1
he said : ' when you come to @entity1 , like the @entity154 last week , you have to make sure you play well			1
if you play well and take something it is excellent for a club like ours , and where we have been , and what is expected			0
so we are very pleased with it			0
' @entity4 have been hit hard by injuries , not least in goal with @entity165 and @entity166 out , providing the opportunity for the @entity168 to come in			2
@entity27 said : ' i would expect him to make those saves but , to be fair to the kid , he has waited a long time			2
it is not easy being the third - choice goalkeeper			2
' the corners were raining in from @entity176 and he stood up to the task of it			0
maybe 18 months ago he found that a struggle			0
' he will remember that , he has kept a clean sheet at @entity7			2

@entity1 drew 0 - 0 at home to @entity4 on saturday afternoon
@entity2 missed a late chance to win the game at @entity7
but @entity0 believes his *striker* ' worked very well '
@entity27 described @entity2 as the @entity8 ' best player
