game of chance : lord @entity2 said sport in primary schools had become ' too much of a lottery ' lord @entity2 was plunged into a sexism row last night after saying that most women teachers lack the confidence to take @entity11 lessons in primary schools			1
the former @entity14 chairman blamed their failings on training colleges that offer only six to ten hours of sports tuition over two years			2
although he was simply highlighting research carried out by a sports charity , his comments drew an angry backlash			0
‘ it is entirely unacceptable to be peddling such sexist nonsense , ’ said @entity23 , general secretary of the @entity24			1
‘ i ’m sure @entity27 and all those other female olympians would be outraged by such views			2
to imply that female primary school teachers do n’t have as much ability as men to teach sport is n’t right			1
’ but @entity2 , the government ’s @entity34 legacy ambassador , insisted it was not a question of ability , but one of training			1
‘ i was shocked by how little they get , ’ he said			2
‘ eight out of ten teachers in primary schools are women			2
and this is not remotely pejorative but i think that something like 80 per cent of them said they just did not feel confident taking physical education			1
‘ i am guessing that there will be a lot of men who will feel the same way			2
’ lord @entity2 has long emphasised the ‘ crucial ’ need to provide better @entity11 teaching in primary schools			1
he raised the issue during a talk he gave in @entity58 , @entity59 , where he lives			0
@entity60 , head teacher of a nearby primary school who was among the audience , said : ‘ @entity2 said 80 per cent of primary school teachers are women who have had no formal training in @entity11 at all			1
his implication was that women are less sporty than men , but that ’s ridiculous			0
' fears over sport : @entity72 of the @entity73 claimed that many children start secondary school unable to throw a ball , catch , jump or run ‘ it was basically the old - fashioned view that women teachers are a bit fluffy and not keen on sport and , if it came to football , would not know the rules			2
lord @entity2 was not trying to be clever but just trying to make a point that was not really valid			1
‘ he needs to look at the dance and aerobics activities going on and similar sports activities and not just traditional sports such as football and running			0
‘ @entity2 is a highly successful athlete in his own right and the trouble is people who do n’t know better believe him and they go away saying , “ no one runs sports in primary schools			1
” ‘ so if parents are going to help out with school sports activities , they may wonder what the point is after hearing him express that view			0
‘ @entity2 seems to think that we should turn out olympians and athletes , but our job is to make children fit and understand their bodies			1
that way we can lengthen their lives			0
’ @entity34 success : lord @entity2 is hoping to inspire the next generation of @entity111 by targeting primary teaching earlier this year , @entity72 , the head of the @entity73 which carried out the research , claimed that many children starting secondary school were unable to throw a ball , catch , jump or run			1
she said that even pupils inspired to take up a sport after watching the @entity34 missed out because teachers were not well trained enough to help them			0
@entity122 sports minister @entity122 said : ‘ we do need to improve the quality of teaching sport in primary schools but if @entity2 is implying that female teachers ca n’t teach sport because they ’re women , then he ’s wrong			1
‘ if he ’s saying teaching sport is poor because it ’s predominately taught by women in primary schools then he is taking us backwards , rather than moving forwards			0
’ earlier this month @entity2 helped launch a new £ 150 million grant for school sports facilities			2
the investment comes as the government unveils plans to train teachers to specialise in @entity11 at primary school			1
lord @entity2 said : ‘ the problem in primary schools is that @entity11 has become too much of a lottery			1
if you have a head teacher – male or female – who understands sport then probably you ’ll have a better chance of getting good provision			0
‘ but if their experience of sport was not good then that tends to filter through the school			0
it occurred to me that the big gap in provision was in primary schools			0
‘ i saw this as not just a money issue – it was also about changing attitudes , particularly in teacher training			0
the amount of teacher training that was carried out shocked me			2
‘ one of the real challenges here is that between the ages of nine and 15 children in the @entity168 become 50 per cent less active			0
now that is not sustainable and that ’s why we focus on the primary schools			0
‘ i am not talking just about rugby , cricket , football , track and field etc. you would be limiting children ’s opportunities if you just did that			0

lord @entity2 said he was ' shocked ' by how little training pe teachers get
he said 80 per cent of female @entity11 teachers said they did *n't* feel confident
' unacceptable to be peddling such nonsense , ' says @entity24 general secretary
