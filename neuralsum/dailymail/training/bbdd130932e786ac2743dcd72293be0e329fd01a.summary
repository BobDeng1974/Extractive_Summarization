speak to the viewers like they 're 10			2
that 's the trick @entity3 's media handler likely taught him before his tv tour de force in the @entity6 debate			1
@entity7 , a former @entity8 presenter turned media trainer , reportedly coached the former @entity11 cabinet minister for his debating clash with @entity14 first minister @entity13			1
commentators called the clash a decisive win for the no campaign , with the @entity20 's @entity19 writing glowingly of the once widely - mocked mr @entity3 as an ' energised ' and ' battle - hardened ' political operator			2
seconds out ... @entity13 , first minister of scotland and @entity3 , chairman of @entity23 take part in a live television debate hosted by @entity27 at the @entity28 of @entity14 on august 5 ' strikingly impressive performance ' : commentators widely backed mr @entity3 as the debate 's surprise winner today @entity33 reports that mr @entity7 is ' fast emerging as the assistant of choice for top politicians '			1
a so - called no - nonsense bruiser who began his career as a print journalist in @entity41 in the 1970s , mr @entity7 went on to be part of the original @entity8 team when the channel launched in 1989			1
he is a veteran journalist who also presented the breakfast show on the ill - fated @entity46 and even sports a @entity48 - style moustache			1
now , as gamekeeper turned poacher , so to speak , he coaches those who want to get the message across into the media with one simple , central message : ' pitch it at a ten - year - old			2
' @entity48 - style moustache : @entity7 , the newsman turned media trainer who is believed to have coached @entity58 for his appearance ' if you use words that viewers have to process in order to understand , then they will miss the next three to six words you say			1
' that strategy believed to have guided mr @entity3 to his unexpected victory over the wily mr @entity13 in the recent televised @entity6 debate			1
' for a man with a reputation as a dry - as - dust bank manager , @entity3 mounted a strikingly impressive performance , ' commented a @entity20 editorial following the face - off			0
' in two hours of vigorous argument , the former chancellor dismantled @entity13 â€™s case for independence , leaving him blustering and deflated			2
' well like among politicians for his discretion , mr @entity7 last night refused to comment when asked by @entity33 if he had worked with mr @entity3			1
he responded similarly when , following @entity85 's unexpected @entity84 coup in 2010 , rumours spread that he had worked his magic on the leader of the @entity88			0
but while his clients list is a closely guarded secret , his words of wisdom are more widely reported			0
in a @entity94 seminar in 2010 he told clients to stick to simple language			0
' even the @entity97 uses language that could be understood by a literate 12 - year - old , and the tabloids aim for a reading age of about eight or nine , ' he was quoted as saying by the industry magazine			0
' think about that when you are talking to a print journalist			2
' and he stressed the importance of capturing audiences ' imaginations			0
' " imagine " is the most powerful word you can use in an interview , ' he said			0
' if you just inform people , they will forget the message			0
@entity117 in mind the other two @entity116 principles - educate and entertain - and they are far more like to recall it			0

former *labour* chancellor was coached by *ex-journalist* @entity7
his strategy for handling the media believed to have led @entity58 to victory
@entity7 was a journalist for *36* years , *including* on @entity8 and @entity127
