a young woman , who had no luck when she posted an ad on @entity3 to find the father of her unborn son , is determined to keep searching after her baby almost died at birth			1
@entity8 had a one - night stand with a man in @entity10 , @entity11 on april 23 last year and surprisingly discovered she was pregnant after being told in 2011 that she was unlikely to ever become a mum when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome			1
the 25 - year - old frantically searched for the father for five months but had no success as she only knew his name was @entity18 who was from the @entity10 suburb of @entity20			1
as a last - ditch attempt she decided to post the ad which only created unexpected vitriolic responses from total strangers			1
two months ago , @entity25 was born , but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him but now the little fella is fighting fit and healthy			1
now that life has returned to normal after the trauma , the graphic design student has continued to look for @entity25 's father , a fly - in , fly - out worker in his 20s , who she met at the @entity38 wednesdays night at @entity39			1
' i 'm so appalled at comments that i am a bad mother and ' god help my child '			2
it makes me sick that people can judge so quickly off something that is 500 words long , ' she said on her @entity62 page			0
' yeah i am still looking , i will probably always be looking i am very curious as to who this person is and one day @entity25 probably will be too			2
' i do n't ever expect him to come forward but if he did contact me , it would only be between us two and not the world			0
' @entity47 then responded to the accusations that she was paid to do the media interviews			2
' for the incredibly judgemental people thinking it is all about money , i have never accepted anything for the stories , i also have my own money , i work and i study full time , i am not this drop kick you assume me to be ! ' she said			2
' i love this beautiful boy with all my heart and i am a fantastic mother , he is strong , smart , happy and very , very loved ! ' she then went onto express her gratitude for the ongoing support of her family and friends in the town of @entity85 - 260km north of @entity10			1
' not only do i have the support of my family but also this beautiful town i live in and my amazing friends , i am so appreciative of everyone who has been kind to me even if you are holding your tongue ! ' she said			0
' i do n't know if this will be the end of this story , i will continue living my life and raising @entity25 just as i have been , in no way is getting 15 minutes of fame a priority on my list			1
' @entity25 , my family , our health and happiness is all that matters to me			2
' @entity8 posted a @entity3 ad last year in an attempt to find her unborn son 's father @entity47 's ad ( pictured ) received a barrage of hateful remarks from complete strangers when @entity47 fell pregnant all she could think about was letting the pending father know the news			1
' i was at my wits end , ' she told @entity115 in december			2
' i tried finding him for months and felt pressured by a friend who was adamant i do n't give up despite exhausting all avenues			0
' this when @entity47 , who was so stressed that she was losing sleep , decided to post an ad on @entity3 which created a barrage of hateful responses prompting her to take to take it down			1
' i stupidly put it up thinking no one would even see it but who knows what will happen , maybe i will get lucky , ' she said			0
' unfortunately all i got was lots of judgement and idiots messaging me telling me they would be the father or pretending to be @entity18			1
' the most offensive messages were from people saying that @entity47 should have opted for a termination			2
' when it was shared on the @entity140 bible page a lot of people made single - minded comments aimed at me , no one mentioned the guy was equally a part of me getting pregnant , ' she said			2
' sometimes i want to be like one of those people on @entity146 screaming back at the audience because they have no clue what they 're booing about ! ' @entity47 was forced to take down the post but has no regrets about deciding to have the baby @entity47 ( pictured before being pregnant ) never thought she could have children as she suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome @entity47 was n't exactly shocked to be called names like a ' sl * * ' but it got out of control when one person lashed out saying ' kill it '			1
' it was sad to see people saying i should get an abortion , those were the only comments that hurt			0
' ' society is still hating on women who choose to keep pregnancy outside of a relationship , ' she said			0
' i was more mad at the amount of women ( mums included ) saying i should n't go through with it			0
' but @entity47 has risen above the horrendous backlash and ca n't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months			1
' all i can say is i chose to go ahead with the pregnancy because i did n't think i could have children , ' she said			0
' even though i knew this guy had disappeared i did n't want to give up my chance and i 'm so grateful i did n't			0
' @entity47 has hit out at people saying she is a ' sl * * ' , a bad mother and has only told her story for money despite the fall - out from the ad - @entity47 has the loving support of the people who matter most - her family and friends			1
' it has changed my life and made me a happier healthier person , ' she said			0
' i could n't be happier , i am looking forward to holding my little guy and raising him in a loving stable environment			0
' she is also looking forward to getting back into shape ' excited to hold him and excited to start getting back in shape ! ' she said			0
' i hate that i 'm so limited physically			0
' @entity47 still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son 's life			1
' i do hope that i can find him and let him know , he can make his own choice , ' she said			0
' but more for the sake of the kid , when he asks questions or wants to find him i want to be prepared			0
' she still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of @entity25 's life			1

@entity8 had a one - night stand with a man in @entity10 on april 23 , 2014

in a desperate last ditch attempt , @entity47 posted an ad on @entity3
she only knew his name was @entity18 and lived in the suburb of @entity20
described as ' *5,7ish* ' , aged in his 20s , with **brown** hair and **brown** eyes
she had no luck from the ad and received some disturbing responses
