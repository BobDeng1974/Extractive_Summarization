@entity0 officially exited administration on wednesday and brought to an end one of the most painful and worrying periods in the club ’s history			1
now the priority is to fight their way back to @entity11 football ’s top flight under the stewardship of @entity13			0
with @entity15 and @entity16 vying for the @entity17 next season that will be no easy task			1
saved : @entity0 owner @entity13 , left , and @entity0 chairman @entity19 mp , right , celebrate the club 's exit from administration alongside @entity23 but when the very survival of the club was in doubt for much of the last 12 months , wednesday ’s announcement was another reason for optimism for @entity0 fans			1
in a statement , new owner @entity13 said : ‘ by now you will have all heard and , yes , it 's true , we have formally exited administration ! ‘ everyone associated with the club is ecstatic and now we can really begin to move ahead in implementing our plans for the future			1
‘ so what now ? well , the first thing is to get season tickets on sale as quickly as possible and the club will be issuing information regarding this tomorrow			1
‘ following this , we will shortly be issuing information on new signings and more pre-season friendlies which , i know , is what all the fans are desperate to here			0
‘ however , for today , let 's just celebrate the news ! ’ building : @entity56 says she wants to move the club forward and has big plans for the future @entity19 mp , chairman of @entity62 , added : ‘ we are obviously delighted			1
we were always looking forward to this day and we were hoping it would have come a lot sooner , but we were never confident until ( administrators ) @entity66 left the @entity67 with the paperwork all signed , sealed and delivered to say the club is officially out of administration and can progress towards fan ownership			2
‘ i am naturally a fairly optimistic person at the best of times but even the most optimistic person would have , at various points along the way , feared this day was not going to come and that we should prepare for the worst - case scenario			0
‘ but to be fair to @entity66 they have used all their skill and professionalism to push things through and deal with all the frustrations to reach this historic day for @entity0			2
‘ it ’s important to stress that this is not the end of the process , it ’s the start of the process of rebuilding the club , a club which has been hollowed out by the previous owners , and it ’s now about getting the finances healthy again and getting the team back into the @entity93			0
‘ but @entity0 fans are the same as supporters of other clubs , we want to be talking about football and this means we can get on with that			0
’ difficult : coach @entity101 will have a tough job turning the club 's fortunes around in the @entity105 @entity106 have already ploughed £ 1million into the club to help clear over £ 500,000 of football debt taken on by @entity56 ’s new regime and the organisation ’s more than 8,000 monthly contributors will finance £ 1.4m over the next two seasons			2
surplus cash raised by @entity106 will be banked to allow the fans to pay off @entity56 ’s £ 2.5m ‘ loan ’ within the next five years and give the supporters full control of a club brought back from brink			0
joint administrator @entity120 , who has now successfully overseen the administration exits of @entity0 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , was a satisfied man last night after finally being able to pass the club back to new owners with the prospect of a bright future ahead			1
he said : ‘ this has been a challenging and complex process which has , fortunately , had a successful conclusion			0
‘ in entering into an administration you can never be sure of the outcome and it is often a case of dealing with the day - to - day issues whilst also pushing for the final goal of exiting administration			0
‘ there have been many people involved with this process over the last year and many have lived and breathed every minute of this administration in their efforts to produce this result			0
‘ i would again like to thank @entity13 and her team at the club , the foundation , the fans , @entity148 and all at @entity149 for their outstanding legal advice and patience , as well as the staff at @entity66 who have all put up with a lot to ensure the great name of @entity0 survives to fight another day			2
’ best interests : @entity0 director @entity160 has had to oversee drastic cuts made at the club to safeguard its future			1

@entity0 exit administration and can begin to plan for *fiscally* secure future
club plans to release information on season ticket *purchases* immediately
@entity0 will play in the @entity105 alongside @entity15 and @entity16
