@entity0 is narrowly winning the battle for floating voters , according to a major poll out today			1
the @entity5 survey of 4,000 undecided voters found a slim majority have been more impressed with the performance of the prime minister than that of @entity11 during the election campaign			1
a separate poll of marginal seats by the former @entity16 treasurer @entity15 suggests that @entity18 ’s vote is being squeezed in key constituencies as election day approaches			1
a @entity5 survey of 4,000 undecided voters across the @entity23 found a slim majority have been more impressed with the performance of prime minister @entity0 than that of @entity11 during the election campaign it also suggests education secretary @entity29 is set to hold her marginal seat in @entity32			1
today ’s @entity5 survey , for @entity36 ’s @entity35 show , found that 37 per cent of floating voters have been impressed with mr @entity0 ’s performance on the campaign trail so far , compared with 31 per cent who think mr @entity11 has done well			1
@entity40 was just behind on 30 per cent			2
meanwhile , @entity42 leader @entity41 , has impressed 21 per cent of voters on the back of her strong performance in last week ’s televised leaders ’ debate			1
ms @entity41 appears to have been biting her nails is the pressure starting to tell on @entity41 ? from the look of her hands as she met her party ’s candidates in @entity56 yesterday , it looks like the 44 - year - old @entity42 leader has been struck by a bout of behind - the - scenes finger - chewing			1
mr @entity0 also suffered less badly from negative appraisals			1
while 49 per cent said they were ‘ unimpressed ’ with the prime minister ’s performance , 54 per cent said the same of mr @entity11			1
but the poll also shows that politicians have yet to shift many of the undecided voters whose support is likely to be critical in next month ’s election			1
just 12 per cent of the group said they had made up their minds since they were last polled in march			2
another 48 per cent said they had a ‘ good idea ’ who they would back , while 16 per cent said they were ‘ starting to lean towards a certain party ’			2
almost a quarter ( 24 per cent ) said they were ‘ completely undecided who to vote for ’			1
floating voters identified the @entity80 as the most important issue , followed by immigration , the cost of living and the economy			1
meanwhile , lord @entity15 ’s survey of @entity88 - @entity16 marginals suggests mr @entity0 still has a lot of work to do just to hold on to the seats he won in 2010			1
of ten @entity16 - held marginal constituencies , @entity88 is ahead in four seats , with the parties tied in another			2
mr @entity0 also suffered less badly from negative appraisals , with 49 per cent of undecided voters saying they were ‘ unimpressed ’ with his performance and 54 per cent saying the same of mr @entity11 ( pictured ) lord @entity15 said the study showed @entity18 ’s vote was being squeezed since the same seats were polled last year			1
‘ the @entity18 share had fallen significantly – by up to 10 points – in nine of the ten seats polled , ’ he said			1
the decline in @entity18 support has helped the @entity107 consolidate their grip in @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and mrs @entity115 ’s @entity114 constituency			1
the education secretary , whose 3,744 majority is the smallest in the @entity119 , is now nine points ahead of the @entity88 challenger			2
but @entity88 also appears to be benefiting from the squeeze in @entity18 support in some areas , moving ahead of the @entity107 in @entity125 and increasing its lead in the @entity16 - held seats of @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity130 and @entity131			1
in @entity134 , @entity132 , @entity88 and the @entity133 were tied with 40 per cent each			2
@entity40 said he was not concerned about the @entity15 polls , saying : ‘ in areas where the two big parties are firing heavy artillery and we are not , it is perhaps not entirely surprising			2
’ @entity11 and @entity141 on the campaign trail @entity11 ’s wife has revealed how he led her to believe he was single when they met at a dinner party – at the home of the woman he was dating			1
@entity141 said she was furious to discover he was seeing another woman			2
she also described how that evening , the future @entity88 leader bored her by insisting on talking about economics			0
mrs @entity141 told the @entity151 : ‘ i thought he was good looking and clever and seemed to be unattached			0
but we just went down a conversational @entity154			0
‘ apparently we had nothing in common			0
he wanted to talk about economics – one of my least favourite subjects			0
none of our conversations went anywhere			0
’ the unpromising start to their relationship was compounded when she found out he had been going out with the woman who invited them to dinner			2
i bumped in to him a couple of times after that , but we did n’t start seeing each other for at least a year , ’ she said			0
speaking while she was campaigning in @entity174 , @entity175 this week , mrs @entity141 said : ‘ canvassing in the rain always reminds me of falling in love with @entity11 in 2005			1
‘ i had never been out leafleting before and did n’t realise you had to keep your eye out for dogs on the other side of the letterbox			0
‘ i ’d been bitten by a doberman			0
@entity11 bandaged me up and i fell in love with him			1
’ @entity88 slammed for ' weaponising child sex abuse in campaign shadow home secretary @entity186 released figures which showed reports of child sex abuse have risen by 60 per cent over the past four years @entity88 was last night accused of ‘ weaponising ’ child abuse after blaming the @entity191 for a rise in child sexual exploitation			0
shadow home secretary @entity186 released figures which showed reports of child sex abuse have risen by 60 per cent over the past four years , while arrests for these offences have fallen by 9 per cent			0
the @entity107 said the figures were ‘ false ’ , and accused @entity88 of ‘ playing politics ’ with an ‘ appalling crime ’			0
they said the rise in reports was due to more awareness of the issue in light of scandals in @entity88 council areas such as @entity207 and elsewhere			0
last night conservative mp @entity208 said : ‘ is there no level to which @entity88 wo n’t stoop ? first they tried to weaponise the @entity80 , now this			0
’ miss @entity186 claimed the figures showed police are not able to respond to the scale of the reports , pointing out that over the past four years , almost 17,000 officers have been cut			0
she added : ‘ [ @entity16 ] plans for deeper cuts in the next @entity219 cutting over 20,000 police would be deeply damaging to the fight against child abuse			0
’ a @entity16 spokesman said : ‘ child abuse is an appalling crime , and no one should play politics with it			0
@entity88 ’s conclusions are false			2
they are talking about the amount of crime that is reported to the police			0
‘ but for many people , child sexual abuse has been a hidden crime which is only now coming to light , and it is good that more people are having the courage to come forward			0
rather than making up numbers about police officers , @entity88 should support the action we have taken to expose this evil crime , to prosecute the perpetrators and to support survivors			0
