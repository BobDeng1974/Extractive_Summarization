@entity1 all - rounder @entity0 admits he still feels ' devastated ' from his exclusion earlier this summer			1
@entity0 had been widely tipped to feature in @entity1 's one - day international team for the series against @entity5 , especially after playing the series against @entity7 in may			1
however , he ended up playing just the one - off @entity8 international against @entity5 , which @entity1 won , scoring an unbeaten 21 and conceding 14 runs with the ball for no reward			1
@entity1 all - rounder @entity0 admits he still feels ' devastated ' from his exclusion earlier this summer @entity0 has been enjoying life at club level , averaging 44.64 in the @entity15 , as @entity16 only narrowly missed out on promotion from @entity18 , and earned himself a new one - year deal			1
while he has been recalled to the @entity1 squad for the tour of @entity7 , it is the summer that @entity0 still carries regret , as he said : ' obviously i 'm devastated ( about the exclusion )			1
' life is full of surprises , but now i just want to focus on the future , and getting back into the squad for @entity7 is a great feeling			0
' @entity0 made his @entity31 debut against @entity32 in @entity33 in 2007 and will hope to be on the plane there once again when @entity1 fly out for next year 's @entity36			2
to that effect , when asked if he had any major changes to make to his game ahead of the @entity7 tour , @entity0 added : ' nothing special			2
' i 'm mainly hitting as many balls as i can			0
that 's all you can do as a cricketer			0
' i 'm going to be in the nets pretty much every day ( until we set off for @entity7 )			0
' @entity0 faces still competition for an @entity1 place from all - rounders @entity51 ( left ) and @entity52 @entity53 ( who won @entity54 at the @entity55 ) has been backed to become a success @entity0 has also backed @entity1 's rising star @entity57 to make it at least a decade of success after he was named the @entity60 at the inaugural @entity55 at @entity61 @entity57 saw off competition from fellow all - rounder @entity0 , @entity64 's @entity52 and @entity65 's @entity51 , with the accolade coming just a few weeks after he was also given the @entity68 title			1
the 27 - year - old 's individual success is a result of his form for both @entity1 and @entity72 , most notably when he took 19 wickets in the test series against @entity5			1
and @entity0 , who will line up alongside @entity57 on @entity1 's winter tour to @entity7 , said : ' @entity53 has been brilliant this season			2
' he 's shown his talent , how good he can be			0
' he 's always looked like a guy who should go on and play at the top level , and now he 's got there it 's great to see			0
' i hope he goes on and has a great career for @entity1 for the next 10 years or more			0
' winning [ the @entity86 award ] is great for him , it will give him more confidence and self - belief			0
