by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:04 est , 9 december 2013 there was a time when children only needed to master reading , writing and arithmetic , yet a new toy wants to teach them how to program a computer - and it 's aimed at four - to seven - year - olds			2
called @entity14 , the kit comes with a wooden robot called @entity16 , a programming board and instruction blocks			1
children place each of the instruction blocks onto the board in a set order to determine how @entity23 moves , before pressing a red button to set the robot in motion			1
hidden inside the board is an @entity37 circuit that reads the position of the blocks and transmits the directions to a circuit inside @entity42 called @entity14 , the kit comes with a wooden robot called @entity16 , a programming board and instruction blocks			1
children place each of the instruction blocks onto the board in a set order to determine how @entity23 moves , before pressing a red button to set the robot in motion			1
each block is a different colour and represents a different command : the red block moves @entity23 forward , blue turns it to the left , yellow turns the robot to the right and the green block acts as a function key			0
the function key acts like a subroutine , which is a set of instructions that can perform a certain task repeatedly , when used as part of a larger program			0
each block is a different colour and represents a different programming command : the red block moves @entity23 forward , blue turns it to the left , yellow turns the robot to the right and the green block is the function key			2
the function key acts like a subroutine , which is a set of instructions that can perform a certain task repeatedly , when used as part of a larger program			0
built inside the board is an @entity37 circuit that can read the position of the blocks and transmit directions to a circuit inside @entity42			1
when a child hits the red button , @entity23 moves according to the pre-programmed route			0
for example , if a child puts three blue ( left ) blocks into the board in a row , @entity23 will move in a circle turning left , left and then left again			0
the function block is used to help children build up longer patterns and users can place the blocks in any order to make @entity23 move differently each time			0
‘ skills are mastered gradually , ’ explained the developers			0
‘ mountains are climbed one step at a time			0
think of @entity14 as the very first step in a child ’s programming education			2
@entity14 provides the very basic @entity114 of programming logic			1
‘ we insist on entertaining our children with tablets and smartphones , but we forget that children learn more effectively through physical play			0
each instruction block is a different colour and represents a different programming command : the red block moves @entity23 forward , blue turns it to the left , yellow turns the robot to the right and the green block acts as a function key ‘ we wanted @entity14 to teach children the logic of this incredibly important topic with a magical and tactile experience			1
' @entity14 's founders are @entity138 but they are based in @entity139 , @entity140			0
they set up a @entity142 campaign last month to fund the @entity14 kit and needed to raise £ 35,000 by 22 december in order to start selling the device			1
the company announced today it is set to reach this target within days but devices wo n’t be available until august next year			2
a diy version of the kit , which needs to assembled at home , will also set parents back £ 135 but anyone who pledges to the campaign can receive a fully - assembled version for £ 160			1
built inside the board is an @entity37 circuit that can read the position of the blocks and transmit the direction information to a circuit inside @entity42 , pictured			1
when a child hits the red button on the board , @entity23 moves on a set of wheels , according to the pre-programmed route			2

the @entity14 *system* *includes* a wooden robot called @entity16
children put instruction blocks into a board to control how @entity42 moves
it has been *designed* to teach children the ' @entity114 of programming logic '
@entity178 version costs £ 135 and is set to reach its @entity142 goal within days
