by @entity0 published : 09:47 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 09:48 est , 16 october 2012 @entity2 's latest masterplan for saving the euro involves a huge transfer of power to @entity6 by countries using the endangered currency			1
but @entity9 is seen as a major stumbling block for his plans as the divide between @entity9 and the continent becomes wider by the day			0
finance minister @entity15 says he is ' determined ' to end the euro crisis once and for all			1
the antidote - giving the @entity19 far greater powers over the national budgets of individual states			1
man with a plan : @entity2 's finance minister @entity15 ( left ) speaks with @entity26 's deputy prime minister @entity25 ( right ) in @entity27 yesterday			1
he has proposed giving the @entity19 far greater powers over the national budgets of individual states ' we now need to go a major step in the direction of a fiscal union that will go beyond the proposals made so far , ' mr @entity15 said on monday night during a flight back to @entity34 from a tour of @entity36			1
mr @entity15 said he wants to concentrate on far - reaching reforms that include : it is understood that mr @entity15 discussed his plans with @entity41 president @entity40 , @entity43 president @entity42 , @entity45 president @entity44 and @entity47 president @entity46 before he went public with them and has received the green light			0
mr @entity15 's proposals look like being discussed at the @entity19 summit in @entity6 this thursday and friday			2
enacting them will require changes to the @entity19 treaties signed by member states			2
he wants to convene an @entity19 convention by the end of the year in which @entity19 members work on a draft that would then have to be ratified by the 27 member states			2
observers say it would take at least 18 months , and probably longer , before they can be implemented			0
' that , of course , assumes that @entity9 , which is not a member of the euro zone and which often opposes steps towards closer @entity70 integration , will play along , ' said @entity2 magazine @entity71			1
any resemblance ? @entity73 this week compared @entity74 and the @entity9 to the irascible stars of @entity76 and @entity77 ' if it does n't , it wo n't be possible to change the @entity19 treaties			0
@entity82 governments would have to come up with a separate treaty as they recently did with the fiscal pact			0
' the @entity9 should not underestimate @entity15 's determination to solve the euro crisis			1
chancellor @entity73 backs the proposals			0
' on monday this week the same magazine said that mrs @entity73 is actively plotting for an @entity19 without @entity9 in it and thinks @entity74 and the @entity9 are the @entity77 of @entity70 , it was claimed yesterday			0
the @entity2 chancellor apparently likens the prime minister to the grumpy @entity92 who constantly grumble from the sidelines .			0

@entity2 finance minister @entity15 ' determined ' to end euro crisis
plan is to give @entity19 greater powers over national budgets of individual states
making the @entity70 ***commissioner*** for *economic* and currency **affairs** equally as powerful as the ***commissioner*** for *competition*
*forcing* individual member states to hand over part of their budget *sovereignty* to @entity6 , *allowing* the currency **affairs** ***commissioner*** to exercise veto power over national budgets . this would give @entity6 to the right to send back budgets to countries if it did n't like the look of them .
*creating* ' more *democracy* ' by getting the @entity124 involved in ' all *important* processes ' much *sooner* than at present . he also wants to change the **voting** *structure* - @entity9 , for *instance* , would be *excluded* from **voting** on issues concerning the euro because it does n't use it .
