the @entity13 's @entity12 ( @entity14 ) has dropped @entity15 for a month and he has been barred from officiating @entity7 matches this season			1
according to reports in @entity20 , there is a real danger he could be demoted from the list of @entity13 match officials following his poor handling of the game			1
scroll down to read @entity27 's verdict on the suspension rejected : @entity5 's appeal against his three - match suspension has been denied dismissed : @entity5 was sent off in the 75th minute of the 1 - 1 draw at @entity32 , a damaging result in the context of their @entity13 title challenge bewildered : the @entity36 could scarcely believe he had been sent off @entity5 was sent off for the seventh time in his career in the 75th minute of sunday 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity32 after he raised his hand to @entity8 captain @entity42 , who fell to the floor theatrically			1
he also confronted @entity8 midfielder @entity44 during an ugly melee			2
@entity46 is understood to have originally stated that he sent @entity5 off for the incident with @entity42 but then changed his story to say he had dismissed him for pushing @entity44 - a fracas the @entity8 player started			1
@entity51 born referee @entity15 has a reputation in @entity20 for being consistently poor			0
for the last three seasons he has finished far enough down the refereeing authority 's end of season 's rankings that he has been a major candidate to be relegated to the second tier			0
he does n't have the arrogance of several of his even more unpopular colleagues and is liable to be pressured into making mistakes by players rather than erring because of an exaggerated desire to be the focus of every game - but he is seen as incompetent all the same			0
he fell over in the @entity8 vs @entity7 game last weekend and that fits his reputation for not being in control			1
he is also criticized for lacking the character needed to officiate in the top flight			0
@entity7 have complained previously over his failure to send @entity73 for dissent in a match where he had booked the full - back but then allowed him to call him ' loco ' ( crazy ) to his face			2
@entity80 squaring up : @entity5 argues with @entity8 midfielder @entity44 , sparking a melee involving a number of players from both sides trouble : @entity5 puts his head into the face of @entity44 having swiped his hand across the face of @entity8 captain @entity42 ( left ) scrap : ronaldo postures as the players square up to each other @entity5 has been banned for three matches and will miss his team 's forthcoming fixtures against @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 - a major blow in @entity7 's bid to beat rivals @entity101 and @entity103 to the title			1
the @entity36 , who turned 29 on wednesday , was banned for one match for violent conduct and a further two matches for dissent as he walked from the field			0
he was also fined just under £ 1,000			0
however , the news that @entity15 has been suspended will encourage @entity7 in their appeal against @entity5 's ban			1
the innocent one : @entity5 stands back as the arguments carry on long walk off : @entity5 leaves the pitch after being shown a straight red card the @entity118 's @entity117 convenes on friday to consider their argument			1
@entity5 , the @entity121 winner who has scored 32 goals in 31 matches this season , is still eligible to play in the @entity126 and featuring during the midweek 3 - 0 win over @entity101 at the @entity129			2
he will also be able to play in next week 's second leg			0
wow ! what a remarkable decision by the @entity20 @entity12			0
i would n’t like to be the next referee who officiates in a @entity7 game			2
this is all about @entity7			2
the fact @entity137 has been given a one month suspension and told he can not referee any more @entity7 games indicates the power and influence they have			1
it may have been a harsh red , but we have seen those before			0
the chairman of the @entity147 is @entity20 too , so he will be taking an interest in this			0
