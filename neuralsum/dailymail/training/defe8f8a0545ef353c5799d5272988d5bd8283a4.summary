plus size women are angry that @entity1 charges more for larger clothing , but one @entity4 host has said they should focus their energy ' on a treadmill ' instead			1
@entity8 , who hosts daily radio show @entity7 , was addressing a recent campaign started by @entity12 - based merchandiser @entity10 to persuade the brand to scrap its controversial size - based pricing policy			1
after thursday 's show , men and women took to @entity19 to voice their disbelief , with one critic calling for his suspension			2
sparking controversy : @entity24 host @entity8 said that plus - size women protesting @entity1 's pricing policy should focus their anger ' on a treadmill ' instead twitter user @entity29 remarked : ' @entity8 on those plus - size women complaining about @entity1 : " maybe these woman should focus their anger and energy on a treadmill instead			1
" ' sports writer / consultant @entity35 tweeted : ' so how long will @entity8 's suspension be after saying plus sized women should " get on a treadmill " ? ' real estate professional @entity40 also had sharp words for the outspoken host : ' most ridiculous argument ever for charging women more for plus sized clothing			1
surprised at you @entity8 # sexist			0
' @entity50 resident @entity49 tweeted : ' i really hope the feminists get a hold of what @entity8 is saying right now			0
i 'd love for him to be off the air			0
' the smaller the size , the smaller the price : @entity1 's popular @entity58 are $ 34.94 if bought in sizes 0 to 20 mr @entity8 , who has two children from a previous marriage , including a ten - year - old daughter , is known for his outspoken views on the @entity4 show , which he 's hosted for more than a decade			1
earlier this week , @entity1 tried to claim that ' unique fabrics and design elements ' were to blame for the controversial size - based pricing policy , which has left women particularly frustrated given that menswear items remain the same price regardless of size			1
according to ms @entity10 , who is calling for the brand to scrap its ' discriminatory ' plus - size up - charges , the discrepancy between the prices for larger men and women is nothing other than ' straight up fat shaming '			1
' @entity72 women like myself are kind of fed up with being treated like second - class citizens by retailers , ' the 34 - year - old told @entity86			0
' i think it 's reached critical mass and people are ready for a change			0
' unfair increase : any women who buy a pair of the @entity58 in a plus size fit will be charged an additional $ 10 , bringing the total price up to $ 44.94 after ms @entity10 started a petition on @entity99 , calling for the brand to change their gender - biased price policies , a spokeswoman for @entity97 , @entity1 's parent company , released a statement blaming the increased costs for plus - size womenswear on the fact that the larger designs require additional details not found in the smaller sizes ' for women , styles are not just larger sizes of other women ’s items , they are created by a team of designers who are experts in creating the most flattering and on - trend plus styles , which includes curve - enhancing and curve - flattering elements such as four - way stretch materials and contoured waistbands , which most men 's garments do not include , ' spokeswoman @entity117 explained			1
' this higher price point reflects the selection of unique fabrics and design elements			0
' but ms @entity10 insists that the statement does not address why there is not a single increase for any of the larger menswear designs , particularly as they also require the use of additional materials			2
' every woman knows how hard it is to find a good pair of jeans : a pair that is the right fit at the right price , ' she wrote on the petition			0
' that ’s why i was shocked when , during a recent visit to @entity1 ’s website , i noticed that they were charging $ 12 - $ 15 more for plus - sized women 's jeans - but not up - charging jeans for “ big ” men			2
' if they are charging plus - sized women more to cover the cost of the fabric being used , then why are n’t they doing the same for men ? @entity157 up : @entity10 ( pictured ) wants @entity1 to scrap its ' discriminatory ' prices fighting for change : ms @entity10 's petition has been signed by more than 33,000 people ' i was fine paying the extra money as a plus - sized woman , because , you know , more fabric equals higher cost of manufacture			1
however , selling jeans to larger - sized men at the same cost as they sell to smaller men not only negates the cost of manufacture argument , but indicates that @entity1 is participating in both sexism and sizeism , directed only at women			2
' and it seems that ms @entity10 is not alone in her opinion ; thus far her petition has gained the support of more than 33,000 people , with many agreeing that @entity1 's ' unfair ' prices should be scrapped once and for all			2
' i wear a plus size , and have noticed that other stores these sizes may be a bit higher in price , but not to the extent that old navy charges , ' supporter @entity190 commented on the petition			0
plus size discrimination : @entity1 offers a variety of plus size designs but ' and in other stores , men are also charged higher for plus sizes			0
why does old navy penalizes us because we are women ? this discrimination needs to stop			0
' while many brands charge more for their plus size collections , blaming the additional fabric for the increased costs , the majority implement the same - or similar - price adjustments for both men and women			2
' when you ’re talking about needing more yardage , it ’s going to be more expensive - but that ’s true for men as well , ' @entity215 , chief executive of @entity216 , a monthly subscription service for plus - size clothing told @entity86			1
' it does n’t actually make sense to me why men ’s is not priced differently			0

earlier this week , plus size campaigner @entity10 *slammed* the brand 's ' discriminatory ' prices which see only women charged more for larger clothing
@entity4 radio host @entity8 said that plus - size campaigners should focus their anger ' on a treadmill ' instead
