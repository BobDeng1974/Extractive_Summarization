@entity0 , pictured , claims she has been left £ 60,000 in debt , stands on the brink of losing her home and is embroiled in a legal fight millionaire businessmen @entity6 and @entity7 present themselves as the poster boys of @entity10 surrogate parenting			1
but for one surrogate the decision to work with their @entity10 @entity12 ( @entity14 ) has proved to be disastrous			2
the @entity17 - @entity16 were the first gay couple named on a surrogate baby ’s birth certificate and went on to have four more children , set up their surrogacy agency and star in reality show @entity25			1
but 5,000 miles away in @entity26 , @entity0 claims she has been left £ 60,000 in debt , stands on the brink of losing her home and is embroiled in a legal fight which has taken her to the edge of financial ruin			1
it is a complicated tale mired in claim and counter-claim from which no one emerges unscathed			2
‘ this whole process has been a disaster , ’ she says			0
‘ the low point for me was going into hospital for an emergency caesarean section and waking up to find nobody would tell me if the twins i was carrying were alive or dead			0
i still have nightmares and anxiety attacks to this day			0
’ @entity0 , a 35 - year - old mother of two , had successfully been a surrogate to twin girls for a @entity48 family when , at the end of 2013 , she decided to become a surrogate again			1
she said : ‘ i wanted to bring the joy of children to a family who might not otherwise experience that happiness			0
you get paid to be a surrogate , but this was never about making money			2
’ she added : ‘ the @entity59 leapt out at me			0
@entity6 and @entity7 sounded like remarkable men			0
i got in touch with their local office in @entity64			0
i thought i was in for another magical journey			0
instead it turned into the worst experience of my life			0
’ at first , @entity0 says , all went well			1
she signed a 24 - page surrogacy agreement on november 21 2013 in which she agreed to bear a child ( or multiple children ) for @entity73 and @entity74			1
@entity0 is coldly referred to as ‘ @entity75 ’ throughout			1
the document says @entity0 will be paid £ 22,500 for one child – with childcare , lost wages , medical bills and ‘ extra baby ’ clauses built in – and an extra £ 5,000 for twins			1
my weird and wonderful family : @entity7 and @entity86 , the gay @entity87 couple hold a pair of long - distance twins @entity90 and @entity91 they were the first gay couple named on a surrogate baby ’s birth certificate she also agrees to give up all parental rights to the children			1
the document says @entity0 will be tested for sexually transmitted diseases , including @entity101			1
she agrees not to smoke , drink alcohol or take drugs and the document coldly discusses what will happen if the child is born with life - threatening illness : ‘ the @entity75 shall have no input			2
the decision to utilize life - sustaining treatment … for the child shall be made by the @entity112			2
’ @entity0 , who works as a personal assistant for her father , a legal adviser for @entity116 veterans , says there were money problems from the start			1
‘ at my first appointment they told me i was carrying twins			0
i was very sick so the doctor ordered me to take total bed rest			0
the bills started piling up			0
’ she claims the @entity14 failed to provide a translator , making it difficult for her to correspond with the @entity129 - speaking ‘ intended parents ’ in @entity130 , adding : ‘ i tried to do everything through the @entity14 , but they were grossly incompetent			1
’ @entity0 explained : ‘ i kept submitting bills for expenses and the payments would be late			1
the @entity14 told me there were issues in @entity130 and that because surrogacy was illegal in @entity130 they ’d had their bank account flagged up			2
i emailed @entity86 at the end of last year , begging him to help to get my bills paid			0
in return he sent me emails full of abuse			0
’ @entity7 and @entity86 have featured in a number of television shows , including @entity147 's @entity148 and @entity149 's on @entity150 in one email @entity7 , who lives in a sprawling @entity87 mansion , purportedly wrote : ‘ i advised your @entity153 ( @entity112 ) not to pay you anything at all because you are a crazy bitch who deserves to be locked up ! your ips will not be paying you one more penny ! i am so happy that they ran from you ! ’ another says : ‘ u should be ashamed of urself you utterly selfish cow ! you are just trailer trash woman and i want nothing more to do with u ! i will dig up all ur dirt including all the lawyers u p * * * * d off on this case ! you will not get one more penny , let ’s face it ur contract will not stand up in any court in @entity130 ! lol			2
’ @entity86 last night claimed the emails shown to @entity177 by @entity0 had been doctored – something she vehemently denies			1
but she admits she ’s made mistakes , including an angry email exchange with the @entity130			2
‘ i sent some hateful emails to the @entity130 couple which i deeply regret			2
' i asked them if they really wanted these babies			0
they interpreted that as me threatening to abort the twins			0
i would never do that			0
' but i told them , if they did n’t want these children , i would have to place them up for adoption			0
’ proud fathers @entity17 and @entity198 with their children @entity199 and @entity201 after another of their surrogate mothers , @entity196 delivered them @entity0 says she bears no ill - will towards the @entity130 , who moved to @entity26 for the birth			1
they take a less charitable view of @entity0 , saying she was unreliable and unsuitable to be a surrogate			1
but there is one thing that they all agree upon – the @entity14 did a poor job , a point made by their lawyer in court documents			0
@entity0 went into labour on 30 august last year : ‘ i was doubled over in pain and rushed to the nearest hospital			1
when i woke up the babies were gone and nobody would tell me if they were alive or dead as i had signed over my rights			0
’ @entity0 never saw the twins and was forced to go to court to try to get her outstanding bills paid			1
a @entity225 judge ordered £ 16,000 to be placed in a bond for her , which she claims the @entity130 failed to pay – choosing instead to leave the country			1
@entity6 and @entity7 with @entity199 , @entity229 and @entity230 @entity0 went on to say : ‘ i blame @entity14 for all the problems			2
the @entity130 did n’t realise that the costs could escalate as they did			0
’ last night @entity233 , vice-president of the @entity14 , said : ' the majority of the money @entity0 claims is owed is medical fees incurred because she insisted on using a hospital not covered by her medical insurance			1
she was advised of this but refused to change			0
’ @entity0 claims that she used an ineligible hospital because she needed an emergency delivery			1
curiously , the @entity14 denies having any responsibility for administering the contract or even creating it , saying it was negotiated through both sides ’ legal representatives			2
@entity86 told @entity177 that @entity0 had been extremely difficult to deal with and that her lifestyle meant she was not suitable as a surrogate			1
‘ she actually is as mad as a hatter , ’ he said			0
which rather begs the question – why was she chosen to be a surrogate in the first place ?			2

@entity17 - @entity16 were first gay couple on surrogate baby ’s birth certificate
set up surrogacy agency and starred in reality show the parent makers
@entity0 claims she has been left £ 60,000 in debt by the pair
