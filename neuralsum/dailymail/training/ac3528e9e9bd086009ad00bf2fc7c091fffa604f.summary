sir @entity7 said pupils should be directed towards either an academic or vocational school halfway through secondary education			1
his blueprint – outlined in a speech to business leaders – will be seen as tacit backing for a revival of academic selection			0
sir @entity7 said that pupils should be directed towards either academic or vocational training midway through their secondary education in a speech to the @entity21 it follows the revelation that two new grammar schools are being planned in @entity25 and @entity26 , in what would represent the first major extension of selection by ability for 50 years			1
home secretary @entity31 is backing plans for a ‘ satellite ’ grammar in her @entity35 constituency while defence secretary @entity37 is supporting a similar scheme in @entity39			0
sir @entity7 has previously spoken of his opposition to traditional grammar schools , claiming they fail to improve social mobility because they are ‘ stuffed full of middle - class kids ’			1
but in a keynote speech to the @entity21 , he backed a degree of academic selection later in a child ’s school career , at age 14 before they start their gcse courses			1
a ‘ fundamental shift ’ in school structures was needed , he said			0
under his proposals , schools would form local ‘ clusters ’ with each developing different specialisms such as highly academic education – similar to a grammar – and vocational qualifications			2
vocational options might include the existing @entity65 ( @entity66 ) , which already take pupils from 14 and teach them skills needed for a trade or industry			2
‘ would n’t it be good if at least one of the schools in the cluster had particularly strong vocational provision from 14 , perhaps in a @entity65 or a specialist college ? ’ he said			0
‘ young people could then transfer across institutions in the cluster to provide a route to high - level academic or vocational study			2
students on either path would be free to access the specialist teaching available in the other and would not be stuck in one route			0
’ sir @entity7 insisted he was not advocating ‘ selection at 14 ’ but ‘ maximum opportunity at 14 ’			1
in a newspaper interview foreshadowing the speech , he suggested that children would be assessed ‘ in consultation with parents , teachers and employers ’ and directed towards a school that best matched their aptitudes at 14 or 16			0
‘ i am absolutely sure it is going to happen , ’ he said			0
in his speech , he said the shake - up was needed to ensure all talents were catered for and tackle @entity104 ’s ‘ lamentable ’ record on providing vocational education			1
home secretary @entity31 is backing the creation of a satellite grammar school in her own constituency sir @entity7 said that figures showed 146,000 jobs are unfilled because companies can not find staff with the skills they need			1
he said vocational education must no longer be seen as a ‘ consolation prize ’			2
apprenticeships should be held in the same regard as a-levels and ‘ sold aggressively ’ to young people , he added			0
sir @entity7 ’s plans were immediately welcomed by @entity121 , the former @entity122 education secretary			1
he said the speech was ‘ most important ’ and backed the proposal for clusters of schools with ‘ at least one of the schools in the cluster having particularly strong vocational provision from 14 – for instance a @entity65 ’			0
@entity132 passed laws in 1998 banning the opening of any more grammar schools but the @entity136 made it easier for the remaining 163 state grammars to open ‘ satellites ’ .			0
