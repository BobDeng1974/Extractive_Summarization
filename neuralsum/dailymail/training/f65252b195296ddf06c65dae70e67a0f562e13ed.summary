at first glance , these images may look other - worldly , but they actually show everyday materials such as glass and foam - and each one are winning entries in a photo competition designed to show the beauty of engineering			1
other entries include a kaleidoscopic swirl of a neural network , ribbons of crystals unfolding like sheets of wrapping paper and a photo showing the look of relief on the faces of villagers in @entity22 after their local well was repaired			1
the @entity24 ’s @entity26 photo competition shows the breadth of research going on at one university alone			1
the @entity24 ’s @entity26 photo competition shows the breadth of research going on at the university			1
this is the winning image by @entity33			1
it shows free - standing graphene foam , which is made by growing layers of graphene on the surface of a porous metal foam skeleton , which was the dissolved so that only the foam remains along with three main winners , the @entity42 - sponsored competition had two extra categories this year : a prize for images taken using an electron microscope and a @entity49 ’s prize for the photo or video with the most innovative engineering story behind it			1
the first prize was awarded to @entity33 , for his image entitled @entity57 , which shows free - standing graphene foam , made by growing layers of graphene on the surface of a porous metal foam skeleton			1
the skeleton is then carefully dissolved so that only the graphene foam remains			1
second prize went to phd student @entity65 for his image of extrapolated art , extending past the edges of paintings to see what the full scenery might have looked like			2
he used the @entity73 algorithm on the frame of @entity76 's painting @entity77 to extrapolate its contents ( pictured left )			0
a pretty image of graphene flowers by @entity81 is pictured this image shows pulsed laser deposition , which was used to apply a metal layer to a glass slide			1
the technique is used for creating structures that induce thermal and electrical conduction across the surface of an insulator			0
the image was captured by @entity92 using an optical microscope as it ’s electrically conductive , highly porous and lightweight , graphene foam could be used in applications such as chemical sensing , energy storage and ultra-lightweight structures			1
dr @entity100 used an electron microscope to take the image and then applied artificial colours to it			0
second prize went to phd student @entity65 for his image of extrapolated art , extending past the edges of paintings to see what the full scenery might have looked like			0
he used the @entity73 algorithm on the frame of @entity76 's painting @entity77 to extrapolate its contents			0
third prize went to undergraduate student @entity117 , for an image he took while on his gap year in rural @entity22			1
the @entity120 was awarded to @entity121 for his image of a bridge forming in self - healing concrete			2
a sample was collected from the cement ’s self - healing zone , where flower - like bridges effectively expanded and healed the cracks undergraduate student @entity117 took third prize in the competition for an image he took while on his gap year in rural @entity22			1
in it , a group of people crowded around a broken village well and await the one person who can help - @entity138 the engineer ( centre ) in it , a group of people crowded around a broken village well and await the one person who can help - francis the engineer			0
despite a lack of formal training , @entity138 took water to scores of local villages through ingenuity and hard graft			0
he jumped down the well and quickly sorted the problem – the rope had simply fallen off the pulley – restoring order so the day could carry on as normal			0
the @entity120 was awarded to @entity121 for his image of a bridge forming in self - healing concrete			2
a sample was collected from the cement ’s self - healing zone and put under a microscope , where flower - like bridges effectively expanded and healed the cracks			2
worldwide , a significant amount of money is currently being spent on the repair and maintenance of existing concrete structures , although its demand is increasing			0
this image shows an array of diffractive lenses imaged using a dark field optical microscope			0
each lens is composed of hundreds of metallic nanostructures , which scatter light at specific wavelengths in this picture the invisible has been made visible			0
a web of carbon nanotubes are bundled together and integrated in a matrix			0
the carbon nanotubes were synthesised in a continuous gas phase process and the picture shown is a snapshot of this			0
the image is a negative bottom - up growth of nanostructures is a fascinating area of nanoscience			0
this image shows @entity199 nanowires grown on a graphite flake during thermal chemical vapour deposition , and has been coloured using @entity202 considering the growing concrete demand , environmental concerns , and the longevity of built infrastructure , suitable self ‐ healing technology adaptation in cement concrete is becoming a highly sought after technology			0
@entity211 ’s prize went to @entity212 for his video of the rise and fall of liquid crystal ‘ mountains ’			2
he made a video from a collection of images taken at one - second intervals			2
it shows the slow growth of liquid crystal structures under the influence of an alternating electric field , and their rapid collapse as the field is reversed			0
entrants , including students , professors and other staff , were told that the images they entered may be ‘ beautiful , fascinating , intriguing , amusing , or possibly all of these things ’			0
the images were judged by experts at @entity42 , and @entity24 professors including @entity237 , @entity238 is the first female president of the @entity239			1
‘ we continue to be blown away by the beautiful images produced by our students and researchers for this competition , ’ said @entity240 , director of research for the @entity49			1
‘ but more than just pretty pictures , these images also show how engineering is helping to solve problems , big and small , all over the world			2
while our winners were judged to be the best of this year ’s entries , we received more than 250 diverse , beautiful and meaningful images			1
’ a color - coded map shows the output of a deep neural network applied at each point in the image			1
deep neural networks have recently enabled breakthroughs in machine vision , speech processing and translation , but some of their properties still are not well - understood			2
this research is a small part of the effort to understand why they work here , researchers from the @entity274 and the @entity275 ( @entity276 ) supervise the installation of the innovative fibre optic instrumentation into the lining of one of one of @entity283 ’s sprayed concrete tunnels during its construction			1
the picture was taken 131ft ( 40 metres ) below ground level			0

@entity24 ’s @entity26 photo competition shows breadth of research at the university
as well as the *top* three prizes , there were two for microscopic images and showing an innovative engineering story
first prize was awarded to @entity33 , for ' @entity57 ' showing free - standing graphene foam
other entries include a kaleidoscopic swirl of a neural network , ribbons of crystals unfolding like sheets of wrapping paper and a photo showing the look of relief on the faces of villagers in @entity22 after their local well was repaired
