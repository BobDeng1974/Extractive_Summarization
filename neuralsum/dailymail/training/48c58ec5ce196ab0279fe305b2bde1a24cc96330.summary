by @entity0 prince @entity1 has stopped selling eggs at his farm shop after a fox attack on his hen coop killed 24 of the birds prince @entity1 was left with egg on his face after having to shut down his close farm egg business because foxes attacked his chicken coop			1
a total of 24 hens were slaughtered by foxes , leaving @entity15 unable to sell eggs from the farm , near his @entity18			1
some of the birds survived the attack and have since been moved to another premises to keep them safe from being preyed on by foxes			1
the eggs are usually sold from his farm shop in @entity27 , @entity28 , which he owns in addition to others in @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33			1
but yesterday customers in @entity27 were greeted with a notice to say : ‘ dear customers , the fox killed 24 of our chickens now the rest of the surviving chickens have been brought to a more secure location			2
this will mean no more eggs to sell , sorry , regards			0

prince @entity1 invested around £ 100,000 in his organic retail business when he moved it from @entity18 to close farm , @entity27			1
last year , @entity60 shut down after the vegetable business was blighted by the long , cold spring			0
while some hens did survive the attack , they are now being moved to a safer nesting spot ( stock image ) the @entity1 did maintain a roadside , un-staffed shop , with an honesty box for public buyers of a limited range of produce			1
