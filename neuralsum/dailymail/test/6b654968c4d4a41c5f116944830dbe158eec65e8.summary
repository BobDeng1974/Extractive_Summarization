we all need a helping hand sometimes , and nobody more so than @entity3 the baby orangutan , who had a tough start to life after his natural mother and another surrogate mother rejected him			1
but the one - year - old ape found love at the third time of asking with second surrogate mother @entity13 at @entity15 's @entity14 , and has today been pictured cuddling up to the experienced mother ahead of his first public outing this weekend			1
@entity13 , 53 , who has already raised one surrogate child , has proved herself yet again by helping to raise @entity20 ( pronounced @entity21 ) for the past 10 months , and the two now have an inseparable bond			1
but the elder orangutan quickly returned , at which point @entity3 quietened down and scooted over to join her , reports the @entity43			2
@entity3 had to be moved from his birthplace at @entity47 zoo , in @entity48 , 14 months ago after his natural mother failed to bond with him properly after birth			1
he was moved to @entity51 and given to a second surrogate , but she did not form a bond with him either			0
in a final attempt to find a parent for @entity20 , he was handed over to @entity13 , the oldest orangutan in @entity57 , who has already raised four children of her own , and a fifth surrogate which was given to her in 2002			1
the pair immediately showed signs of intimacy , but zookeepers still faced a tense wait to see if the elderly orangutan would take on full parental duties			0
@entity68 , one of the zoo â€™s lead primate keepers , said that the turning point came when a fire alarm sounded at the zoo a few weeks ago , frightening @entity20 , who ran to @entity13 and cuddle up to her			2
turning point : keepers in @entity15 said the turning point for @entity3 came a few weeks ago when a fire alarm went off on the zoo , frightening him			1
usually he turned to people for comfort , but instead he ran and cuddled up to @entity13 big day : after settling into his new enclosure , @entity3 will go on display for the first time this weekend in two hours slots between 10am and midday , allowing him to nap in the afternoons getting into the swing of things : keepers said when @entity3 and @entity13 were first put into their new enclosure , the older ape would wander too far ahead , and @entity3 would get lost , but the pair have now learned to stick close to one another she said : ' initially when he would be feeling insecure he would turn to people , and then there was a shift where he would turn to @entity13 if he felt insecure			1
that was a big milestone			0
he really needs her to learn how to be an orangutan			0
' the pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo 's four other orangutans , but at the moment they are living in isolation , as would be the case in the wild			2
@entity3 will be on display on saturday and sunday at @entity14 's @entity117 enclosure between 10am and midday			0
the other orangutans will be allowed into the enclosure around those times to help them acclimatise as well			0
hanging out : the pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo 's four other orangutans , but at the moment they are living in isolation , as would be the case in the wild happy monkey : keepers said : ' on his first day out he was wide eyed and a bit amazed			2
he stayed close to @entity13 and whimpered if she moved too far away			0
we saw many joyful reunions those first few days as they separated and found one another again '			0

@entity3 the one - year - old orangutan was taken to @entity15 zoo after being rejected by his mother and surrogate mother
he was eventually given to @entity13 , 53 , who had already raised four children of her own and another surrogate
keepers were *concerned* pair might not bond , but ten months later they have formed an inseparable *connection*
@entity3 will go on display for the first time this weekend *alongside* his mother , but only for two hours at a time
