the corporation ’s flagship current affairs show @entity3 , which is edited by former @entity8 executive @entity2 , failed to report spy chief @entity13 ’s speech on tuesday			1
other @entity9 reports , including the @entity15 , online articles and radio bulletins , referred to his speech but made no mention of his key claim that the left - leaning newspaper had done ‘ enormous damage ’			1
@entity24 mp @entity23 , who sits on the @entity25 , said : ‘ it is extraordinary that the biggest security story for a generation was n’t deemed worthy of comment by the @entity9 ’s leading investigative news programme			1
‘ there seems to be a clear conflict of interest when its editor has so recently taken the @entity8 ’s shilling			2
the whole tone of the @entity9 ’s coverage of this issue seems to indicate clear editorial bias			2
‘ they appear to be protecting their left - wing friends ’			1
the @entity9 did not change its online coverage to reflect the row until @entity8 editor @entity44 publicly defended his newspaper yesterday			2
he appeared on @entity46 at one programme , where he was largely unchallenged , to say his paper ’s coverage had prompted ‘ necessary debate ’			0
only then did the @entity9 update its online news articles to reflect the @entity8 ’s critical role in the leaks with the headline , ‘ @entity8 to publish more @entity56 intelligence revelations ’			2
before joining @entity3 last month , mr @entity2 worked for the @entity8 for 23 years and served as its deputy editor			1
mr @entity13 made his speech at the @entity59 in @entity60 on tuesday			0
his unambiguous warnings about ‘ terrorists ’ contrasted with the @entity9 ’s reluctance to use the word in its reports			0
the corporation was criticised during its coverage of the recent @entity69 massacre for describing the perpetrators as ‘ militants ’			0
debate : @entity8 editor @entity44			2
the @entity9 ignored the @entity6 % chief 's criticism of the paper the @entity77 's coverage of @entity13 's speech although the speech was covered by the @entity9 ’s @entity15 on tuesday , it ignored mr @entity13 ’s criticisms of the @entity8			1
instead , reporter @entity82 chose to focus on mr @entity13 ’s general warnings that the security of the @entity85 was under threat and made no reference to the newspaper			0
at 10.30pm , @entity3 chose to ignore the subject			0
surprisingly , the current affairs show did find time to screen an interview with @entity94 founder @entity93			0
fury : the spy chief : @entity6 director - general @entity13 has blasted the @entity8 's publication of @entity85 's espionage capabilities @entity99 , the @entity101 ’s main article on mr @entity13 ’s speech – written by security correspondent @entity103 – also glossed over mr @entity13 ’s criticisms			1
entitled ‘ @entity6 chief @entity13 warns of @entity110 threat to @entity85 ’ , it made only a passing reference to the role of the @entity8 in the affair			1
the following morning , news bulletins on @entity112 failed to mention the newspaper at all			0
@entity24 mp @entity114 said : ‘ @entity8 is being accused of putting the safety of the public in danger , but the @entity9 has done virtually nothing to inform its own licence fee payers about it			1
‘ the behaviour and the regulation of the press is once again in the public eye , but the @entity9 is in danger of presenting a very partial and distorted view of the behaviour of newspapers			0
’ a @entity9 spokesman said the fact mr @entity2 used to work for the @entity8 had ‘ absolutely no bearing ’ on his editorial judgment			2
he added : ‘ @entity3 did n’t cover the story on tuesday because it was covered thoroughly on the @entity15 and we did n’t feel we could add significantly to that coverage , and because @entity3 devoted 30 minutes to a report , interview and debate about many of the same issues last week			0
‘ this is an on - going story which @entity141 has covered as it developed , including the criticisms from @entity13 , and we will continue to cover it			0

@entity9 *downplays* @entity6 chief 's scathing *condemnation* of @entity8
