the daily lives of medieval townsfolk have been brought to light by an extraordinary haul of graffiti found in @entity5			1
messages have been scratched into the walls of the historic buildings over hundreds of years , but few people have ever stopped to work out what they say			1
archaeologists have now started a major project to decipher the extraordinary messages , and have found a mixture of musical pieces , pious exhortations and even supernatural curses			1
music : these lines of notes ( which have been digitally overlayed for the sake of clarity ) were scratched into the walls of @entity5 in the medieval period ship : this inscription shows a boat about to be swallowed by a giant whale , seen in the bottom right while most church - goers these days would never even contemplate defacing the walls of a @entity35 cathedral with graffiti , medieval residents of @entity31 had a far less protective attitude to their monuments			1
volunteers from the @entity40 began cataloguing the scrawls found in the cathedral earlier this year , and have already recorded hundreds of inscriptions			1
' the walls are covered in everything you can think of , ' project director @entity43 said			1
' @entity48 ships , names , animals , windmills , figures and prayers			1
' just about everything that would have been important to the citizens of @entity5 during the @entity48			1
curse ? the name ' @entity57 ' was carved upside down , implying links to black magic pious : a human figure , thought to be a saint , can just about be deciphered in this photograph superstition : this ' petal ' design was probably used to bring good luck or ward off evil spirits ' i think we have to understand that our modern view of the cathedral is very different from the way in which it was viewed by the local people during the @entity48 , particularly the ways in which it was used			2
' they saw nothing wrong with carving their prayers into the very stones of the building			2
' his deputy @entity84 added : ' these are whispers in stone and you are standing in the place where , hundreds of years ago , someone would have been scratching away			2
' it could be a devout symbol of faith , or someone creating a slander , or a musician noting down a new composition			2
' there are a whole range of motivations - and exactly what they could have been , who knows ? but it is tantalising			2
' @entity105 : the cathedral 's organist is hoping to play the pieces scratched into the walls of the building extraordinary : the etchings have been in place for hundreds of years but were never deciphered until now in the cathedral 's nave , a clear outline of a ship had been recorded earlier - possibly a prayer left for a fisherman or mariner			2
but until last week , no one had spotted that the ship was being pursued by an enormous open - mouthed whale			0
' we think it could have been a prayer made by someone related to a sailor , and the whale is most likely @entity129 's whale , ' mr @entity84 said			0
on another pillar are two four - line musical staves , overlaid with a series of notes , thought to have been inscribed in the second half of the 16th century , before the introduction of the five - line staves used today			0
' we are talking to the cathedral organist and he is having a look to see if he could play it , ' mr @entity84 said			0
' here we have a piece of music from 400 years ago being lifted off the walls - indeed it could have been the organist at the time who scratched this composition onto a wall in order to play it later			0
' project : @entity84 , from the @entity40 , taking a record of the ship inscription iconic : @entity5 has been a centre of worship since it was built during the @entity35 period a more sinister group of inscriptions consist of beautifully carved text which was written upside down , suggesting they may have had a magical import such as being used as curses			1
' we know that from ancient times through to the medieval , inverting things was to wish bad upon them , ' mr @entity84 said			0
' it is exactly the kind of folk magic that the church frowned upon in the extreme			0
' one inscription , showing the figure of a man , has been interpreted as a drawing of a saint , which would be a unique discovery among @entity176 carvings			0
the graffiti was presumably intended to smooth a worshipper 's path to @entity180 - and could even have been scratched into the wall by a @entity182 secretly expressing his forbidden beliefs			0
@entity185 - shaped designs seem to have been carved deep into the stone by masons working on the construction of the building , and have been described as ' devotional gestures ' or symbols to ' ward off bad spirits '			0
the graffiti initiative , which has gained the approval of the cathedral 's @entity195 , will continue throughout the spring and early summer			0
construction on @entity5 began in 1096 , during the reign of @entity200 while it has undergone repeated renovations over the years , what remains of the church mainly dates back to the 17th century , when it was rebuilt after being ransacked by @entity206 .			1
