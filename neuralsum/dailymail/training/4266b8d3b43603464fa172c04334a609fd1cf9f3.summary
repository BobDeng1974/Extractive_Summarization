a drunkard had to be rescued buttocks - first after he followed the smell of beetroot soup down a ventilation shaft			1
onlookers posted footage of the bizarre rescue online after firefighters used sledgehammers to smash through the wall of an apartment block stairwell in @entity13 , @entity14			1
according to reports , the 31 - year - old was a homeless man who crawled head - first down a 16 - inch wide chimney on @entity19 to chase the irresistible aroma of borscht			1
they were alerted to the man 's plight by a resident who heard ' strange sounds ' when he sat down for lunch with his wife			0
' i thought you never know , maybe someone decided to clean the ventilation shaft , ' he said			0
' but the noise was repeated , and as i approached it became clear there was a man there			0
he yelled : " save me , help me , i 'm choking "			0
' bum luck : the ill - fated explorer 's cries for help were heard by rescuers who had to find a crack in the wall firefighters were called and tried a string of methods to pull the man out , including lowering a rope - but he reportedly could not grab hold of it because he was upside down			1
the rescuers then resorted to smashing through the walls			0
because they did not know exactly where the man was , they had to break through the wall in more than one place before they found his bare buttocks staring back at them			1
it then took several minutes to widen the hole , tearing away pieces of brick and masonry , until the man 's legs were exposed allowing him to be pulled to safety			0
it is now known why the man was naked at the waist , but @entity14 media reported he was thought to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs			2
bricking it : the man quivered as firefighters widened the hole by tearing off chunks of brick and masonry @entity103 : after several minutes , the man 's legs were exposed and he was set free the head of the rescue team @entity107 told @entity33 : ' the shaft width is about 40cm			2
this size corresponds to a 14 - year - old , but is not suitable for an adult			1
' the man , who reportedly complained of a broken arm , gave several theories as to why he had crawled into the shaft in the first place			0
one theory was that he had followed the smell of freshly - cooked borscht , the traditional @entity27 beetroot soup			1
another more believable theory was that he was a drug addict who was trying to steal from the residents for his next fix			0
he promised to return and repair the wall but the tenants , unwilling to believe him , have already started fundraising to patch up the hole , @entity33 reported .			2
