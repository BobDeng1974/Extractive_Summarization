by @entity1 reporter published : 06:24 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 08:33 est , 15 november 2012 it 's no secret that raising a child is expensive			2
but many parents will be shocked to learn just how costly it can be			0
after drilling down into the numbers , one @entity7 mother has abandoned any plans to start a family after working out that it could set her back as much as $ 2million for each little darling			0
expensive business : one @entity7 woman ( not pictured ) has calculated that it costs nearly $ 2million to raise a child in the city ( image posed by models ) @entity20 based her calculations on various outgoings , from childcare to college fees , needed to support a child in the city until the age of 25			1
her verdict ? do n't			0
writing in the @entity29 , she said : ' most people want to be sure that they can buy and pay for a home , save up for an emergency fund and enjoy a comfortable retirement			0
' my husband and i , both in our late 20s , share those kinds of goals with others like us , but it seems obvious that the single decision that can best help us achieve them is one that many newly married , affluent young adults do nâ€™t usually consider - do n't have children			0
' painful reading : among the costs , @entity20 factored in health insurance , which she estimated would cost $ 4,000 per child a year mrs @entity20 , who says they earn slightly less than the average couple , used figures published by the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) on what families spend on their children as the foundation for her calculations , but tailored them to her personal situation			1
according to the @entity53 , couples in her income bracket in the urban @entity62 spend $ 22,760 to $ 27,720 per child every year			1
but she says it omits other expenses like college and uses a cut - off of 17 years of age			1
for basic needs , such as food , transport , clothing and entertainment , she based her maths on the costs of raising children in a two - parent family in the urban @entity62 area with a combined income of more than $ 103,350			2
she established that primary child care in @entity7 would set her back between $ 12,750 to $ 16,000 then added the cost of schooling from grades 1 to 12			2
need deep pockets : @entity20 ( not pictured ) based her calculations on various outgoings , from childcare to college fees , needed to support a child in the city until the age of 25 ( file image ) adding a dependent to her health insurance would cost $ 4,000 a year , while saving enough to pay for just half of the college tuition would require a further $ 5,328 a year			1
writing on the @entity29 ' @entity96 after her initial article , mrs @entity20 also factored in losses of around $ 700,000 for maternity leave			1
along with other spending , she estimated the total cost to be just shy of $ 2million			0
she said : ' if we were to have a child and do what most other parents do by trying to give this new little life the very best start possible , it would probably cost us $ 1.8million			0
