the 17 - year pause in global warming is likely to last into the 2030s and the @entity4 sea ice has already started to recover , according to new research			1
a paper in the peer - reviewed journal @entity8 – by professor @entity9 of the @entity10 and dr @entity11 – amounts to a stunning challenge to climate science orthodoxy			0
not only does it explain the unexpected pause , it suggests that the scientific majority – whose views are represented by the @entity19 @entity20 ( @entity20 ) – have underestimated the role of natural cycles and exaggerated that of greenhouse gases			1
pause : how the @entity25 's average temperature defied scientists ' predictions by remaining almost the same the research comes amid mounting evidence that the computer models on which the @entity20 based the gloomy forecasts of a rapidly warming planet in its latest report , published in september , are diverging widely from reality			1
the graph shown above , based on a version published by dr @entity37 of @entity38 on his blog , @entity40 , reveals that actual temperatures are now below the predictions made by almost all the 138 models on which the @entity20 relies			2
the pause means there has been no statistically significant increase in world average surface temperatures since the beginning of 1997 , despite the models ’ projection of a steeply rising trend			1
according to dr @entity37 , the divergence is now so great that the world ’s climate is cooler than what the models collectively predicted with ‘ five to 95 per cent certainty ’			0
@entity9 and @entity59 say they have identified a climatic ‘ stadium wave ’ – the phenomenon known in @entity63 as a @entity65 wave , in which the crowd at a stadium stand and sit so that a wave seems to circle the audience			1
recovery : a new study suggests global warming is at a halt and @entity4 seas are starting to recover in similar fashion , a number of cycles in the temperature of air and oceans , and the level of @entity4 ice , take place across the @entity85 hemisphere over decades			2
@entity9 and @entity59 say there is evidence of this going back at least 300 years			2
according to @entity9 and @entity59 , the theory may explain both the warming pause and why the computer models did not forecast it			0
it also means that a large proportion of the warming that did occur in the years before the pause was due not to greenhouse gas emissions , but to the same cyclical wave			1
‘ the stadium wave signal predicts that the current pause in global warming could extend into the 2030s , ’ said @entity59			1
this is in sharp contrast with the @entity20 ’s report , which predicts warming of between 0.3 and @entity105 by 2035			0
@entity59 added : ‘ the stadium wave forecasts that sea ice will recover from its recent minimum			2
’ the record low seen in 2012 , followed by the large increase in 2013 , is consistent with the theory , she said			0
even @entity114 co-authors such as dr @entity37 admit some of the models are ‘ too hot ’			0
he said : ‘ the upper end of the latest climate model projections is inconsistent ’ with observed temperatures , though he added even the lower predictions could have ‘ negative impacts ’ if true			2
but if the pause lasted another ten years , and there were no large volcanic eruptions , ‘ then global surface temperatures would be outside the @entity20 ’s indicative likely range ’			1
professor @entity9 went much further			0
‘ the growing divergence between climate model simulations and observations raises the prospect that climate models are inadequate in fundamental ways , ’ she said			0
if the pause continued , this would suggest that the models were not ‘ fit for purpose ’ .			0

study says warmer temperatures are largely due to natural 300 - year cycles
actual increase in last 17 years lower than almost every prediction
scientists likened continuing pause to a @entity65 wave in a stadium
