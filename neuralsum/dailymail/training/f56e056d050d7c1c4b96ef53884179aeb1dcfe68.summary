by @entity0 new rights to flexible working will ‘ make workers happier ’ and improve their productivity , a minister has claimed			1
from today , all 30million workers in @entity7 will get the right to ask for flexible hours – instead of just parents and carers			1
@entity12 business minister @entity12 said it was a ‘ 1950 ’s mindset ’ which said workers actually needed to be in the office to get their work done			2
from today , all 30million workers in @entity7 will get the right to ask for flexible hours - instead of just parents and carers but employment lawyers predicted a huge surge in the number of workplace grievances and rising ‘ resentment ’ between workers who get what they want and those who lose out			1
and business groups reminded employees that the ‘ work still needs to be done ’			0
the new right is expected to lead to a huge shift in employment practices in firms where flexible working is not yet allowed			1
it allows workers to demand part time hours , compressed hours , working from home or job sharing			1
miss @entity12 , who has just returned from maternity leave said : ‘ sometimes , because this has been a right to request that only parents have had , that can create , in some workplaces , a bit of tension when parents get special treatment			0
’ she said workers could benefit with compressed hours , commuting outside rush hour and or working from home			1
‘ employers often find that this leads to employees being much more motivated , productive , less likely to leave			0
so that cuts down their staff recruitment costs			0
it really can be a win - win ’ , she told the @entity50 on sunday			0
‘ you get staff that are happy and more productive and the employers benefit from that as well			0
and lots of businesses are very positive about this			0
‘ we live in a globalised society , we have technology which enables us to be doing work not just from physically being there at the workplace but actually doing so at different times of the day and from different places			2
‘ and rather than it staying stuck in a 1950s mind - set that being at work is about physically being somewhere and it ’s about long hours and that ‘ presenteeism ’ culture , actually it ’s about achieving what you ’re supposed to do in your job and doing that in the most effective way			1
@entity12 business minister @entity12 said it was a ' 1950 's mindset ' which said workers actually needed to be in the office to get their work done ‘ so flexibility is n’t a special case ; flexibility is just the way that organisations work and they recognise that they can benefit from that			2
’ but employment lawyers said the new rules could lead to a raft of new complaints from those who lose out			1
@entity99 , an employment law specialist and partner at the law firm @entity103 , said : ‘ we ’ve already started to see an increase in the number of grievances filed by people who feel they are having to make up the work of colleagues working flexibly because they have children			1
‘ with everyone able to request flexible working , the number of grievances is only set to rise			1
’ a survey by the firm found 84pc of employers expect the new right to cause resentment among staff			0
more than half predict the change will adversely affect the day - to - day running of businesses			2
companies have the right to refuse a request for flexible working if there is a valid business reason , such as the changes creating extra costs			2
there are also concerns about how the new rules will work – as requests will be considered in the order they are received and not on merit			0
the new right is expected to lead to a huge shift in employment practices in firms where flexible working is not yet allowed			1
it allows workers to demand part time hours , compressed hours , working from home or job sharing as a result , someone wanting time off for a lie in or a hobby could win out simply if they get their request in first			1
employers have been told they can not judge applications on merit and should ‘ pull the names out of a hat ’ if two people ask for the same thing and both can not be accommodated			0
mr @entity99 added : ‘ it says all requests should be considered equally but what if one request is from a parent and one is from an athlete who wants to train every day ? ’			0
experts have also warned some workers may come to see the rules as a ‘ right to have ’ instead of a right to ask			2
under the existing rules , around three out of five requests are granted and a further one in four after negotiation with employers			0
@entity176 , the @entity177 director for employment and skills , welcomed the new rules but added : ‘ it ’s important to remember that the work still needs to be done , so businesses will have to manage conflicting requests effectively and they retain the right to say no where the company just ca n’t make it work			0

30million workers in @entity7 will get the right to ask for flexible hours
workers can demand part time hours , working from home or job sharing
