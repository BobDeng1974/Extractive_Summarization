new guidance from the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) said that under - 25s should be able to access emergency contraception more readily , including pills and the @entity17 ( intrauterine device , or coil )			1

the new guidance is aimed at cutting the high numbers of unwanted teenage pregnancies across @entity31			0
under the plans , @entity13 said suitably qualified nurses , including school nurses , and pharmacists should be given the ability to dispense free emergency contraceptive pills in accordance with patient group directions ( @entity40 )			1

there are two types of emergency contraceptive pill			0
@entity50 has to be taken within 72 hours , or three days , of sex , and @entity52 has to be taken within 120 hours , or five days			0
meanwhile , an iud can be inserted up to five days after unprotected sex			0
@entity13 also renewed its 2010 call for young people to be given emergency contraception to keep at home in case they need it			1
and it said young women must be told of places they can obtain free , confidential pregnancy tests with same - day results			2
young women should also be ' encouraged to consider and choose a suitable form of contraception for their future needs ' , the guidance said			2
regarding under - 16s , @entity13 said health professionals providing emergency contraception must be aware that they can give it to under - 16s ' without parental knowledge or consent , in accordance with best practice guidance '			1
it added : ' health professionals , including pharmacists , who are unwilling ( or unable ) to provide emergency contraception should give young women details of other local services where they can be seen urgently			1
' morning - after : there are two types of emergency contraceptive pill including @entity50 which has to be taken within 72 hours , or three days , of sex @entity13 said young people should be given access to contraception and advice at convenient locations so nobody is denied services because of where they live			1
' it is really important that sexual health services offering information and advice can be found in places where young people have access to them , ' said professor @entity98 , director of the centre for public health at @entity13			2
' evidence clearly shows that the availability of contraception reduces the rate of unwanted pregnancies			2
local planners and providers of services must make sure that what they offer is right for their area			0
' he added : ' young people often find contraceptive services and advice difficult to locate			0
this can be for a number of reasons			0
accessible : @entity13 said young people should be given access to contraception and advice at convenient locations so nobody is denied services because of where they live ' they may not know where services are , who provides them or when they are open			1
they can also be wrongly worried that information they give may not be treated confidentially			0
for that reason , this guidance focuses on ensuring they receive culturally sensitive , confidential , non-judgmental and empathic advice and support tailored to their individual needs			0
' the guidance also said condoms should always be provided in addition to other forms of contraception to cut the rate of sexually transmitted infections			2

but we really need to build on this recent progress because @entity31 still has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in @entity162			0
' most of the young women who become pregnant while still a teenager do not plan to do so			0
nearly half of all pregnancies among 15 to 18 - year - olds end with an abortion			1
' the new guidance aims to reduce unwanted pregnancies by ensuring that young people have access to a full range of contraceptive methods , not just pills and condoms , but the longer - acting methods , such as contraceptive injections and implants			2
we also need to make sure that young people get good contraceptive advice so that they can choose and use the right method for them			0
' as well as the unnecessary heartache for these young women , unwanted pregnancies also have a financial cost , with abortions for young women under 25 costing the @entity189 approximately Â £ 53 million each year			0
' investing in contraceptive services is a good use of money			0
