by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter it 's long been known that @entity5 's school kids have n't measured well compared with their international peers , but now there 's a new twist : its adults do n't either			1
in math , reading and problem - solving using technology , @entity5 adults scored below the international average on a global test , according to results released on tuesday			1
adults in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and multiple other countries scored significantly higher than the @entity5 in all three areas			1
the findings were equally grim for many @entity25 countries			0
must do better : @entity5 adults were outperformed by their counterparts in multiple countries in reading , math and problem solving beyond basic reading and math , respondents were tested on activities such as calculating mileage reimbursement due to a salesman , sorting email and comparing food expiration dates on grocery store tags			1
all the skills tested are considered critical for global competitiveness and economic strength			0
not only did @entity5 score poorly compared to many international competitors , the findings reinforced just how large the gap is between the nation 's high - and low - skilled workers and how hard it is to move ahead when your parents have n't			1
in both reading and math , for example , those with college educated parents did better than those whose parents did not complete high school			0
the study , called the program for the @entity61 , found that it was easier on average to overcome this and other barriers to literacy overseas than in the @entity5 researchers tested about 157,000 people ages 16 to 65 in more than 20 countries and subnational regions			1
confusion : the international study tested adults in over 20 countries on everyday problem solving it was developed and released by the @entity77 , which is made up of mostly industrialized member countries			1
the @entity80 's @entity79 participated			0
in @entity25 , @entity83 and @entity84 , among the hardest hit by the recession and debt crisis , ranked at the bottom across generations			1
unemployment is well over 25 percent in @entity84 and over 12 percent in @entity83			1
@entity84 has drastically cut education spending , drawing student street protests			2
but in the northern @entity25 countries that have fared better , the picture was brighter - and the study credits continuing education			1
in @entity20 , @entity95 , and the @entity96 , more than 60 percent of adults took part is either job training or continuing education			2
in @entity83 , by contrast , the rate was half that			2
as the @entity5 economy sputters along and many people live paycheck - to - paycheck , economists say a highly - skilled workforce is key to economic recovery			1
the median hourly wage of workers scoring on the highest level in literacy on the test is more than 60 percent higher than for workers scoring at the lowest level , and those with low literacy skills were more than twice as likely to be unemployed			2
test : how do you do with this sample question ? ' it 's not just the kids who require more and more preparation to get access to the economy , it 's more and more the adults do n't have the skills to stay in it , ' said @entity129 , director of the @entity130			0
education secretary @entity131 said in a statement the nation needs to find ways to reach more adults to upgrade their skills			0
otherwise , he said , ' no matter how hard they work , these adults will be stuck , unable to support their families and contribute fully to our country			0
' among the other findings : - @entity5 scored toward the bottom in the category of problem solving in a technology rich environment			1
the top five scores in the areas were from @entity17 , @entity20 , @entity19 , @entity148 and @entity149 , while the @entity5 score was on par with @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155			1
in nearly all countries , at least 10 percent of adults lacked the most basic of computer skills such as using a mouse			0
- @entity17 and @entity96 adults who were ages 25 to 34 and only completed high school easily outperformed @entity83 or @entity84 university graduates of the same age			1
- in @entity152 , @entity167 , @entity83 , @entity155 , and the @entity5 , social background has a big impact on literacy skills , meaning the children of parents with low levels of education have lower reading skills			1
@entity5 's school kids have historically scored low on international assessment tests compared to other countries , which is often blamed on the diversity of the population and the high number of immigrants			1
lagging behind : the @entity5 was below average in literacy proficency also , achievement tests have long shown that a large chunk of the @entity5 student population lacks basic reading and math skills - most pronounced among low - income and minority students			1
this test could suggest students leaving high school without certain basic skills are n't obtaining them later on the job or in an education program			0
the @entity5 will have a tough time catching up because money at the state and local level , a major source of education funding , has been slashed in recent years , said @entity203 , an economist with the @entity204			2
' there is a race between man and machine here			0
the question here is always : are you a worker for whom technology makes it possible to do a better job or are you a worker that the technology can replace ? ' he said			0
for those without the most basic skills , he said , the answer will be merciless and has the potential to extend into future generations			0
learning is highly correlated with parents ' education level			0
' if you want to avoid having an underclass - a large group of people who are basically unemployable - this educational system is absolutely key , ' @entity203 said			2
@entity231 , professor of psychology and education at @entity234 , @entity235 , said the report provides a ' good basis for an argument there should be more resources to support adults with low literacy			0
' adults can learn new skills at any age and there are adult - geared programs around the country , @entity231 said			0
but , she said , the challenge is ensuring the programs have quality teaching and that adults regularly attend classes			0
' if you find reading and writing hard , you 've been working hard all day at two jobs , you 've got a young child , are you actually going to go to class ? it 's challenging , ' @entity231 said			0
everyday problems : the study surveyed 157,000 people aged 16 to 65 in more than 20 countries some economists say that large skills gap in the @entity5 could matter even more in the future			1
@entity5 's economic competitors like @entity266 and @entity267 are simply larger than competitors of the past like @entity17 , @entity129 said			1
even while @entity5 's top 10 percent of students can compete globally , @entity129 said , that does n't cut it			2
@entity266 and @entity267 did not participate in this assessment			0
' the skills in the middle are required and we 're not producing them , ' @entity129 said			0
respondents were selected as part of a nationally represented sample			0
the test was primarily taken at home using a computer , but some respondents used a printed test booklet			0
also among the findings : - @entity17 , @entity20 , @entity18 , @entity96 , @entity19 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , and @entity290 all scored significantly higher than the @entity5 in all three areas on the test			1
- the average scores in literacy range from 250 in @entity83 to 296 in @entity17			1
the @entity5 average score was 270			0
( 500 was the highest score in all three areas			0
) average scores in 12 countries were higher than the average @entity5 score			2
- the average scores in math range from 246 in @entity84 to 288 in @entity17			1
the @entity5 average score was 253 , below 18 other countries			2
- the average scores on problem solving in technology - rich environments scale for adult ranged from 275 in @entity155 to 294 in @entity17			2
the @entity5 average score was 277 , below 14 other countries .			2

@entity5 scored lower than @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 in all three areas
study also *revealed* the huge gap between the nation 's high - and low - skilled workers
researchers tested 157,000 people aged 16 to 65 in more than 20 countries
@entity83 and @entity84 , among the hardest hit by the recession and debt crisis , ranked at the bottom across generations
