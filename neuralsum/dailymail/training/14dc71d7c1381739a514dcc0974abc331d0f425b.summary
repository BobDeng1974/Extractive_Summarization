by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 reporter @entity4 was engulfed in a fresh controversy yesterday when he said the ban on owning handguns was ‘ crackers ’			1
the @entity10 leader said his party would legalise and license firearms for ‘ responsible ’ owners who kept them locked up			1
but he was immediately criticised for the ‘ stupid ’ comments			0
@entity30 went further in 1997 and banned all handguns , including .22 pistols used in the @entity33			0
mr @entity4 said : ‘ i think the knee - jerk legislation that @entity35 brought in that meant the @entity37 @entity33 pistol team have to go to @entity38 to even practise , was just crackers			1
if you criminalise handguns then only the criminals carry the guns			0
’ @entity44 , professor of criminology at @entity45 , said mr @entity4 ’s comments were ‘ irresponsible ’			1
he added : ‘ if public safety is a consideration then it ’s a particularly stupid thing to say			0
’ earlier this week mr @entity4 came under fire after @entity10 councillor @entity51 suggested the recent floods were linked to the legalisation of gay marriage			1
the party leader provoked further outrage by saying women who had children were worth less to @entity25 firms			1
his bad week got worse when he was hit over the head with a placard in @entity62			0
opponents said the remarks were a ' a green light for an increase in criminality ' and ignored the ' the depth of feeling that still exists on what happened that fateful day '			0
mr @entity4 was taking questions on a radio phone - in when he was bombarded with questions about the extreme views of some of his elected councillors and candidates			1
the @entity10 leader tried to laugh the questions off , insisting all of those responsible for controversial comments used be members of the @entity27 party			1
but he courted controversy himself with the suggestion on @entity86 that handgun laws should be torn up			0
a ban on owning most handguns was introduced by @entity91 ’s government in the wake of the @entity29 shooting , when @entity94 killed 16 primary school children and a teacher before turning the gun on himself			1
it was then extended by @entity35 's @entity30 government in 1997 to cover all handguns , including .22 pistols used in @entity33 competitions			0
a listener , named only as @entity91 from @entity104 , told mr @entity4 he had never supported the ban , adding that ‘ law abiding people who follow the law , are mature , should be able to get a licence to hold these sorts of guns ’			1
mr @entity4 insisted he did not want to move to the ‘ absolutely crazy ’ system in the @entity113 where ‘ you can go and buy automatic repeating rifles down at the local gun shop that looks more like a supermarket '			1
mr @entity4 added : ‘ i think the knee jerk legislation that @entity35 brought in that meant that the @entity37 @entity33 pistol team have to go to @entity38 to even practice , was just crackers			1
‘ and , if you criminalise handguns then only the criminals carry the guns			0
‘ and , it ’s really interesting that since @entity35 brought that piece of law in gun crime doubled in the next five years in this country			0
‘ mr @entity4 added : ‘ i think we need a proper gun licensing system which to a large extent we already have and i think the ban on hand guns is ludicrous			1
’ the ban on handguns was introduced in the wake of the @entity29 massacre when @entity94 murdered 16 five - year - old school children and their teacher @entity140 mayor before killing himself asked if @entity10 ’s policy on gun control would be to allow handguns to be ‘ kept in the locked box and you ’ve got your license ’ , he replied : ‘ ’ absolutely			1
’ official figures from the @entity149 in the @entity113 show that there were 6,371 handgun homicides in the in 2012 , and the number has risen every year since 2010			0
should @entity37 allow people to keep handguns in their home , as @entity10 leader @entity4 has suggested ? @entity30 mp @entity156 , who chairs the @entity158 home affairs committee , said : ' the logical consequence of relaxing gun laws , as suggested by mr @entity4 , is an increase in gun use which should be discouraged rather than encouraged			1
any change could possibly act as a green light for an increase in criminality			0
' our legislation makes @entity37 a beacon of safety and it would be completely irresponsible to change the law governing hand guns			2
' @entity174 , conservative justice spokesman in the @entity176 parliament , said : ' for @entity4 to link such ill - advised comments with this tragic event is completely inappropriate			2
' what happened in @entity29 is still fresh and raw in the memories of people and someone like @entity4 should not be making these kind of throwaway comments			2
' perhaps if he visited the town he would realise the depth of feeling that still exists on what happened that fateful day			0
' when you have the leader of @entity10 making remarks like this it ’s no wonder the party ’s views are largely ignored in @entity176			2
' mr @entity4 denied having any idea what was in the @entity10 manifesto in 2010 , but he put his name to the foreword ( above )			1
some of the more eye - catching policies in @entity10 's 2010 manifesto include : during the programme mr @entity4 was repeatedly challenged on why his party attracts people with controversial views			1
he has spent all week fielding questions about @entity10 councillor @entity51 , who suggested legalising gay marriage caused the recent storms which battered @entity37			1
on monday mr @entity4 also gave a speech in the @entity25 , where he claimed mothers are ‘ worth less ’ to employers in the @entity25 than men			1
he suggested women who take time off to have children are paid less because they lose contact with their client base and struggle to succeed when they return to work			2
hours later he was being clobbered over the head with a placard as he tried to enter push his way through an angry protest in @entity62			0
and then yesterday he floundered during a @entity224 interview , when he was forced to disown the whole of his party ’s 2010 manifesto , after being hit with a host of bizarre proposals he knew nothing about			2
@entity10 promised to improve @entity37 by painting trains in traditional colours , deploying soldiers on the street and enforcing a dress code for taxi drivers and theatregoers			2
despite standing on the manifesto as a candidate in the 2010 election , mr @entity4 today dismissed it as ‘ 486 pages of drivel ’			1
the @entity244 - who had briefly stood down as leader at the time to focus on an unsuccessful run for a @entity158 seat - insisted he had not even read the document			2
' i did n't read it , it was drivel , 486 pages of drivel , i did n't read it , nor did the party leader , it was a nonsense , and we 've put that behind us and moved onto a professional footing , ' he said			2
' we had a manifesto , and i 'm going to put some inverted commas around it that was produced in 2010 , it was basically a series of policy discussion papers that was put up on the website as a manifesto			0
' it was 486 pages long , i 'm pleased to say that the idiot that wrote it has now left us and joined the @entity269 , so there is some traffic going back the other way , and they 're very welcome to him			0
' @entity244 was the main author of the manifesto , and is now a @entity27			0
however , it later emerged that he had put his name to the foreword of the manifesto			0
the faltering performance came after the @entity10 leader , who worked in a brokerage firm before entering politics , caused outrage this week by saying women who have children are ' worth less ' to their employers when they return to work			1
he claimed the @entity25 was no longer sexist as in the past , but said women who leave their client base to take ‘ two or three years off ’ to have a baby , put themselves at a disadvantage			2
pressed on the remarks today , he appeared to come close to losing his temper			0
he told @entity86 : ' maybe what we should do is just lie , maybe next time i get a question like this i ’ll just lie , i ’ll just do what everybody else does , i ’ll say something that is n’t true and there will be no debate or argument about it			0
' the fact is , you know , there are now one million men who are bringing up families at home with the women out working , so there are some changes happening in society			0
' but , overwhelmingly it ’s the women that not only have the baby , but really take the responsibility for bringing up the family , and there are some super women who can do that and run a big career , but it ’s not an easy thing to do			0
