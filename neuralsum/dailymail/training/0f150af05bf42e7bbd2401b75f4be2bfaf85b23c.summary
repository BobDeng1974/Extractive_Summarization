by @entity0 published : 09:19 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 19:19 est , 15 april 2013 the hospital trust at the centre of one of the worst health scandals in living memory has been put into administration after losing £ 20million last year			1
@entity7 has been taken over by a team of managers who will spend the next 45 days deciding its fate			0
it is only the second time this has happened in the history of the @entity16			0
@entity17 was put into administration last summer			0
@entity7 - where up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly after they were ' routinely neglected ' - is to be put into administration , it was announced today @entity22 , which runs @entity24 and @entity25 hospitals , has a troubled past and up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly due to poor care between 2005 and 2009			1
in february , a long - awaited report blamed the disaster on a ‘ culture of fear ’ , with managers being more obsessed with meeting targets than patient care			0
but the trust has long been plagued by financial difficulties , largely caused by the fact that it does not serve enough patients for its size			1
the decision to put the trust into administration has been made by the watchdog monitor , which regulates foundation trusts this means it can not generate enough income from providing treatment and services to cover its running costs			1
in addition , it has struggled to attract top doctors			0
as a result it has to use expensive agency staff to plug gaps in the rota			0
on one occasion in 2011 it paid £ 5,700 for one doctor to cover a 12 - hour shift			0
last night the watchdog monitor announced that the trust had appointed administrators to take over its running			2
the new plan will be subject to a public consultation and services at the hospitals in @entity24 and @entity25 ( pictured ) will continue to run as normal until a final decision is reached dr @entity71 – one of the country ’s most senior doctors – and @entity75 , of accountancy firm @entity76 , will spend the next 45 days deciding its fate			1
they are likely to conclude it should be broken up and taken over by neighbouring trusts , such as @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			2
the watchdog insisted that all patient services would continue to be run as normal until its fate had been decided			2
@entity86 , chief executive of @entity87 , said : ‘ it is important that people in @entity22 know that they can still access services as usual at @entity24 and @entity25 hospitals while the trust special administration process is ongoing			1

decision has been made by @entity87 , which regulates foundation trusts
