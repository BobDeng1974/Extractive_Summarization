thunder - like sonic booms are usually associated with aircraft breaking the sound barrier			0
but one holidaymaker has captured a volcano that erupted with such force that it triggered a sonic boom and visible shockwaves that warped the clouds in the sky			1
the video shows a plume of ash being thrown up in the air from @entity14 , in @entity15 , followed by impressive rippling clouds and an eardrum - rattling explosion that rocks the boat			1
they generate enormous amounts of sound energy and sound like a large explosion - as can be heard in the minute - long video			2
the video of @entity14 was shot by 58 - year - old taxi driver @entity35 aboard a small boat on august 29 , when he was on holiday			1
the volcano is located off the coast of @entity15 ( marked )			2
it continued to erupt for several days after the eruption was filmed			0
the volcano explodes every few years last minute : the holidaymaker who captured the eruption ( seen at the very beginning here ) said he decided to make the boat trip at the last minute , taking other tourists with him to see the natural spectacle a sonic boom is the sound associated with the shock waves created by an object , or objects , travelling through the air faster than the speed of @entity55 generate enormous amounts of sound energy and sound like a large explosion - as can be heard in the minute - long video			1
people usually associate the noise with fast aircraft that can break the sound barrier			0
he told the @entity65 that his decision to embark on the filming mission was spur of the moment and he took others along from @entity71 for a closer look at one of nature ’s most powerful – and devastating – sights			2
‘ i thought i might as well try and capture something you rarely get to see , ’ he said			0
but he did not realise how strong the shockwave would be , saying that everyone on the boat ‘ absolutely c * * * * * d themselves ’ when the sonic boom hit			1
in the video , he can be heard saying : ‘ watch out for the shock , it ’s coming , ’ before the shockwave hits the boat , prompting one spectator to exclaim : ‘ holy smoking @entity89 ’			2
mr @entity35 had visited @entity14 a few days earlier when it was dormant			0
the volcano continued to erupt for several days after the eruption was filmed			0
it erupts every few years and in 1994 , exploded at the same time as another local volcano , @entity96 , which destroyed two thirds of the city of @entity99 , @entity94 reported			0
the video has been viewed over six million times and mr @entity35 said that such widespread interest has come as a ‘ bit of a surprise ’			0
but he did n't realise how strong the shockwave would be , saying that everyone on the boat ‘ absolutely c * * * * * d themselves ’ when the sonic boom hit			1
the shockwaves can be seen emanating from the blast ( pictured ) shocking ! the video of @entity14 was shot by 58 - year - old taxi driver @entity35 aboard a small boat on august 29 , when he was on holiday			1
the explosive sound of the boom shocked observers aboard the boat			0
this image shows the volcano after the sonic boom was heard and the boat rocked a sonic boom is the sound associated with the shock waves created by an object , or objects , travelling through the air faster than the speed of sound			1
many people associate them with high speed aircraft , such as an @entity133 ( pictured ) which @entity134 uses to study aerodynamics and sonic boom characterisation			2

@entity14 erupted off the coast of @entity15 on august 29
holidaymaker captured the moment a plume of ash was thrown up
a powerful shockwave can then be seen rippling clouds , before the sonic boom can be heard in the video
it was filmed from a boat and holidaymakers said the noise was shocking
