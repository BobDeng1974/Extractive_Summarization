at the age of 20 , i was going to have to spend the rest of my whole life looking like @entity4			0
or at least that 's what i told myself on the day a dentist grabbed my cracked front tooth , tore it out without warning and gave me a denture			1
for the past 18 years i 've lived with a plastic plate on the roof of my mouth and an utter fear of visiting the dentist			1
i 've wanted to lose the false tooth and the fear - but time and again my courage and finances failed me			1
ten years ago , i enquired about how to replace the denture , but the procedure sounded terrifying			1
no , sireee , that was n't for me			0
finally , though , i 've been nagged into submission by my wife			0
she never minded the look , but i had complained about the denture a lot			1
also , while in most areas i 'd become less bothered about my appearance the older i got , i found i really wanted to have a full set of good teeth again			1
that front tooth had been knocked out twice - both times playing hockey			1
when i was 12 , a ball bobbled up , i was n't wearing a gum shield ( idiot ) and it cracked my top front left tooth in half			1
the dentist removed the nerve and patched the gaps with filling material			1
that lasted until a university hockey match , when i took a stick to the chin			1
i was wearing a gum shield this time , but the tooth wobbled loose			1
i waited months before visiting the same dentist			1
he pushed the tooth then , without warning , ripped it out			1
there was a searing pain and my mouth filled with blood			0
that was enough to fill me with a permanent dread of the dentist			2
in 15 years , i probably had two check - ups			2
you ca n't tell it 's not a real tooth as it was carefully matched to the colour of @entity24 ' existing teeth but it did at least prompt me to take good care of the teeth i had left - steering clear of fizzy drinks and sweets , and becoming a meticulous brusher			1
probably more by luck than judgment , i never seemed to suffer any problems			0
the denture itself - a plastic plate with a plastic tooth attached to it - was a neat fit , and unless you really stared , you could n't tell the plastic tooth from the real ones			1
most acquaintances never knew i had it - save for the odd mortifying moment ( spitting it into a drink as i chatted to a colleague at a @entity106 party or losing it over the side of a boat on holiday )			2
but there were times it could cause throbbing pain , particularly where the top of the plastic tooth rubbed against my gum , and discomfort at the back of my mouth where the plate met my teeth			2
worse , dentists call them ' gum killers ' , because dentures make gums recede and can cause infection from the constant pressure			0
there are an estimated 11 million denture users , and according to the charity @entity131 , most will experience some degree of difficulty			2
' while dentures are a good solution for people who need them , they are no substitute for natural teeth , ' says the charity chief executive dr @entity141			2
problems include poor fit , ulcers and difficulty with chewing or speech			0
' and the earlier teeth are lost , the more problems are likely to be experienced in later life as the supporting bone for a denture shrinks away			2
' having an implant fitted involves drilling a hole in the jawbone and inserting a screw , which will then hold a replacement porcelain tooth in place			1
last december , i made an appointment with dr @entity27 in @entity160 , @entity161 , who is a leading specialist in oral surgery			1
as i sat in his waiting area , my hands went clammy , my legs shook			0
i 'd crossed the rubicon			2
dr @entity27 came into the room and cracked a weak gag			1
i chuckled and he led me to his surgery			0
' do you know why i made that joke ? ' he asked			2
' i 'd already started the consultation			2
i wanted to see how you smile - to see if you had a big @entity178 grin			2
' i need to see if you show your gums when you smile , and then we can be sure we get the right tooth for you			2
' the drop in heart attack risk by having teeth cleaned by a dentist at least twice in two years as many as one in ten adults suffers from dental phobia : it is the third most common phobia after agoraphobia and heights			1
a phobia of dentists is triggered by many things - the sound of the drills , fear of choking , chronic embarrassment , the needles			2
mine is all about fear of pain and the powerlessness			0
you can get it treated			0
a specialist clinic at @entity207 's and @entity208 in @entity161 treats 3,000 to 4,000 patients a year for dental phobia and has long waiting lists			1
or you can find a dentist who is particularly supportive			1
dr @entity27 is a walking , talking anaesthetic			1
his soft - spoken charm put me at total ease even as he ran through the various procedures			2
the implant might not fix in my mouth , it could get infected			2
then there was talk of making incisions and fixing things in my mouth			0
they sounded terrifying - but dr @entity27 described them so practically that by the end of the conversation i was almost ready to go ahead there and then			1
' we 're going to do a tooth in a day , ' he said			2
i was staggered , having imagined weeks of appointments			0
implant surgery has come on hugely since i last checked			0
these days , using the latest x-rays , 3d imaging and piezo drill technology - a special type of precision drill - dr @entity27 would drill precisely into my jaw and insert a screw socket			1
if needed , bits of bone from my jaw could be grafted on to the implant site to help the healing process and plasma from my blood used to help heal the area			0
this would also speed up the healing of my gum			0
he 'd then put in a tiny screw and cement an implant on top			1
i 'd be in at 8am and home by 6pm			0
the success rate is 95 per cent , though all i could think is that this meant one in every 20 fails and ends up falling out			0
and dental implants are not cheap			0
classed as cosmetic surgery , they are not funded by the @entity265			0
a basic implant costs around Â£ 2,000			0
on the day of the surgery , i was given a sedative			0
it did n't knock me out , but made me forget			0
one minute i was in the waiting room nervously reading the paper , the next i was being escorted to a room to sleep off the drug			0
i 'd been in surgery three hours and the screw was in			0
i had to wait a few hours for the swelling in my gum to settle down			0
by 5pm , a temporary plastic tooth was glued on top and i went home with a soft toothbrush to use , antibiotics , painkillers - and very precise instructions to eat soft foods and take care in trying not to bump the tooth for a couple of months			1
some gums bleed in the days after , but luckily mine did n't			0
a few weeks later , after the bone had grown around the screw - to ensure it was firmly in place and my mouth had healed - i had a permanent porcelain tooth glued over the screw			1
it should last ten years or more			0
you ca n't even tell it 's not a real tooth as it was carefully matched to the colour of my existing teeth			1
oddly , losing the denture has proved a bit like losing a limb			0
now it 's gone , i constantly think it 's there - and when i realise it is n't , i fly into a quiet panic thinking everyone can see me toothless			1
and then i remember ... the new tooth does need extra care - particularly flossing , to make sure nothing gets stuck around the top of it			1
but not having that horrible plastic plate in my mouth has been joyful			0
i can barely believe i put off having the surgery for almost two decades .			0
