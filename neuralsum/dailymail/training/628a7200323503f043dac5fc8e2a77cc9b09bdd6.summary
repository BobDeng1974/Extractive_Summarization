by @entity0 @entity2 vice-president @entity1 maintains it is important to award @entity4 to countries that have not hosted them before despite the controversy surrounding the decision to stage the @entity9 in @entity10			1
@entity2 awarded the 2018 and 2022 @entity4 to @entity11 and @entity10 respectively in 2010 , but a report was commissioned amid allegations by the @entity14 that disgraced former @entity2 executive committee member @entity15 had made payments to football officials in return for votes for @entity10			1
@entity2 ethics investigator @entity20 submitted his report into the bidding contests in may and , while he would not be drawn on speculation that the @entity9 could be hosted elsewhere if evidence of corruption was uncovered , prince @entity24 insists it is essential for all the world 's regions to experience staging a @entity9			2
reason : @entity2 vice-president @entity1 insists it 's vital that the @entity9 has new hosts concern : there are fears that @entity10 was the wrong choice for the @entity9 and wo n't deliver the goods project : @entity10 plan to accomodate all the visitors for the @entity9 with @entity40 facilities finished product : the stadium proposals have state of the art designs to make their facilities excellent ' i was not there at the time that these bids were made so i ca n't really comment on that ( the @entity9 being moved )			1
i think the important thing is that we have two wonderful @entity4 coming up in the future , ' he told @entity55 's @entity54 programme			0
' it 's very important to take it to different parts of the world , i 'm a firm believer in that , so let 's just hope that if it 's done in the right way and everything is satisfactory in order to kick off then let 's go for it , whatever the decisions are that come up			0
' prince @entity24 , who is also president of the @entity69 , went on to speak of his pride over the @entity9 coming to his continent in eight years ' time - provided everything is above board			2
he said : ' it 's always a good thing when a @entity9 is hosted in your continent			0
having said that , we 're very proud to be hosting in @entity79 the @entity80 in 2016 , so i 'm very happy if it comes to our region as long as it 's done in the proper and correct way and hopefully things will go in the direction we want			0

prince @entity1 believes @entity10 should not deter @entity2 from picking new countries to the host the @entity9
@entity15 allegedly made payments to football officials in return for votes for @entity10
@entity10 will host the @entity9 in 2022
