by @entity1 reporter published : 02:25 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 03:38 est , 19 october 2012 a ' @entity3 ' hand - grenade left over from the @entity4 left 13 people needing hospital treatment			1
the casualties , who were not seriously injured , were exposed to toxic fumes after workmen disturbed the stockpile of phosphorous grenades left in the sealed - up cellar of a property in @entity14 near @entity15 , @entity16			1
it is thought one of the grenades , issued to members of the @entity21 during the last @entity4 , was dislodged and cracked , @entity17 said			0
lethal : the hand - grenade found was thought to be one issued to the @entity21 - now fondly known as ' @entity3 ' after the popular tv series - during @entity4 the device is a glass bottle about eight inches high which on being thrown and hitting the target was intended to break and release the contents , a highly flammable mixture of phosphorus and benzene , self - igniting on exposure to air			0
it was to be used by the ' @entity3 ' of reservists against @entity37 's @entity36 occupiers if @entity38 had fallen to @entity40 invasion , but had been left and forgotten about for almost 60 years in the sealed - off cellar of a former fire station , now used as the premises of a printing firm			1
the cellar of the old fire station is linked with that of the former @entity49 next door - now an estate agent - and a further six such devices have been found in the shared cellar space			1
both cellars had been bricked up for some years			0
firefighters were first called to reports of a fire at the premises of @entity58 on @entity59 in @entity14 at 12.23pm yesterday			2
but on arrival they soon established that wisps of smoke thought to be from a fire were in fact chemical fumes from a source , thought to be a small container or bottle of acid , in the cellar			2
toxic : six staff at the @entity73 , where the casualties exposed to the grenade fumes were taken , subsequently complained of breathing difficulties two drainage company employees investigating a report from the occupier of damp masonry are thought to have inadvertently dislodged one of the bottles in the stockpile , causing it to leak and release fumes			1
they were exposed to the fumes and were injured along with three workers at @entity58			2
of these five casualties , two suffered chemical burns and three experienced breathing problems			0
two paramedics and six hospital staff at the @entity73 - where the casualties had been taken , subsequently also complained of breathing difficulties			1
one casualty suffered blisters to the exposed skin of his arms but all 13 casualties have responded well to treatment and have been allowed home			0
the cracked grenade has now been made safe and removed from the building for disposal by an army disposal team and the rest of the stockpile will be disposed of in a controlled explosion , the fire service said			0
at the height of the incident five fire engines , a @entity112 , @entity113 and approximately 40 firefighters were sent to the scene and a 50 - metre exclusion zone put in place .			0
