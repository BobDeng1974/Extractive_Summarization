former @entity1 ceo @entity0 leveled the most direct attacks on @entity3 during the annual @entity5 's opening day , challenging her to outline what she got done in her years in the @entity7 and at the helm of the @entity9			1
' mrs. @entity3 , name an accomplishment , ' @entity0 said thursday in @entity11 , bringing a red - meat crowd of @entity14 partisans to their feet			1
' and in the meantime , please explain why we should accept that the millions and millions of dollars that have flowed into the @entity19 from foreign governments do n’t represent a conflict of interest			2
' that jab was a reference to news on tuesady that the @entity25 , @entity3 and @entity26 had received – and would continue to accept – untold million in donations from @entity29 goverments including the @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
' she tweets about women ’s rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights , ' the fired up pol said , her voice peaking			1
but she does n’t know what leadership means			0
' during a question - and - answer session following her speech , @entity0 predicted that ' if @entity3 had to face me on a debate stage , at the very least she would have a hitch in her swing			1
' the crowd went wild			0
@entity0 is trying to win a role in an unprecedented women - only matchup for the @entity58 presidency			1
@entity63 , the first lady - turnedsenator - turned - diplomat , is the @entity62 's presumptive nominee - in - waiting			2
no woman has ever won the presidential nomination of a major @entity58 political party			0
but ' women are now 53 percent of voters , ' she said thursday , ' and so as i like to tell some of my @entity62 friends who continue to talk about a " war on women , " we are not a special interest group – we are the majority of the nation			0
' @entity0 is the only female @entity14 creating any buzz as a potential presidential contender , a situation that seemingly requires daily reminders to voters that it might take a woman to beat a woman			1
' like mrs. @entity3 , i too have traveled the globe , ' she said thursday , referring to the former secretary of state 's nearly unparalleled air mileage			2
but ' unlike mrs. @entity3 , i know that flying is an activity , not an accomplishment			2
' ' i have met @entity112 , ' she said , ' and i know that his ambition will not be deterred by a gimmicky red reset button			0
' that was an uppercut aimed at @entity63 's first outreach to @entity117 after she won @entity7 confirmation in 2009			0
her office meant to send her to meet @entity121 foreign minister @entity120 with a prop button labeled ' reset ' – signifying a new start to @entity125 relations			0
but they reportedly took the @entity121 word from an electrical outlet ' reset ' switch , not knowing that in @entity125 the fixtures read ' overloaded ' or ' overcharged ' when an electrical surge trips a circuit - breaker			0
on wednesday night @entity0 told @entity133 that @entity63 's latest speech in @entity135 indicated that she had run out of fresh thoughts and started stealing a few			1
' @entity3 needs some original ideas , ' she said during a reception for young activists			1
exhibit a : @entity63 's june 2014 memoir , ' @entity142 , ' hit bookstores with a cover that looked like a near - copy of @entity0 's ' @entity147 ' bestseller from 2007			1
then on tuesday @entity63 told women at a conference in @entity150 – @entity0 's old domain as a former tech ceo – that they should be empowered to ' unlock their full potential			1
' that line has been a mainstay of nearly every @entity0 stump speech as she road - tests messages in advance of a possible presidential campaign			2
@entity161 , @entity3 ! @entity0 has taken to trolling @entity63 , saying the former secretary of state is so short on original ideas that she 's begun to steal them @entity165 : @entity63 's 2014 book ( right ) bore an uncanny resemblance to @entity0 's ( left ) from seven years earlier before she launched the ' @entity0 for @entity58 ' political action committee this week , @entity0 's main fundraising vehicle was actually called the ' unlocking potential pac			1
' ' we must unlock the full potential of every @entity58 and unleash the power of this great nation , ' that organization 's mission statement reads in part			0
seizing on the apparently pilfered bit of rhetoric , @entity0 communications director @entity178 quipped on @entity181 : ' guess all those foreign donations couldnt buy her an original speechwriter ? ' on wednesday night @entity0 was at the @entity5 event , an annual half - week of catnip for tea partiers , to rally a group of young conservative activists who had sat through an afternoon ' boot camp ' covering topics from candidate development to getting on television			1
the @entity194 native who now lives in @entity195 is seriously contemplating a run for the presidency , and would be the most viable female candidate on the @entity14 side if she were to take the plunge			0
her limited political experience consists of losing a 2010 @entity203 @entity7 race to @entity204 , an incumbent @entity205 , by 10 percentage points			0
but now she 's playing up her private sector experience , painting herself as an ( almost ) everywoman focused on shaking up @entity209			0
' @entity210 ' : @entity0 spoke to twentysomething - aged right - wing activists after an afternoon of training classes at the site of the annual @entity5 , which kicks off thursday @entity215 - @entity214 : @entity0 's press secretary could n't contain her snark on @entity181 after people watching @entity63 's speech noticed the cribbed turn of phrase ' ours was intended to be a citizen government , ' she told a cheering reception of mostly college - age activists on wednesday night			1
' and what a citizen government means to me is that citizens should run for office			0
' ' you have lots of potential presidential candidates who are going to speak to you , ' she said , previewing the three - day conference where nearly all the @entity14 2016 hopefuls will appear			2
as deafening cheers – largely female – erupted in the hotel reception room , she quickly added , ' me too ! ' @entity62 are largely rallying behind @entity63 – a former first lady , diplomat and @entity58 senator – in the hope of shattering a new glass celing just eight years after putting an @entity243 in the @entity244 for the first time			0
@entity133 asked @entity0 if she could take @entity63 's female novelty off the table			2
' well , ' she exclaimed with a laugh that approached a cackle as twentysomething fans crowded around her for selfies , ' it would sure make it harder for her ! '			0

onetime @entity1 ceo thinks she can keep @entity3 off - balance , giving her ' a hitch in her swing ' during debates
@entity0 hit the @entity19 for accepting donations from @entity29 regimes
' she tweets about women ’s rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights '
the @entity14 spoke at the @entity5
also accused @entity63 of stealing her catch - phrases during speeches : ' @entity3 needs some original ideas '
