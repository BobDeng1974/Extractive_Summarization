by @entity0 published : 09:19 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 14:21 est , 24 january 2014 @entity2 came on the @entity3 this morning to weigh in on the security threats facing the @entity5 but added his two cents about the prospect of a @entity7 beating the likely @entity9 presidential nominee , @entity8 , should she decide to run			1
asked by @entity11 on today whether or not mrs @entity8 is beatable , @entity2 said : ‘ i 'm sure she is , because people recognize the country is just not doing what it needs to be doing ’			0
he vehemently denied that he would ever run again after his failed 2012 bit , and then gave off a quick list of possible @entity7 contenders			2
speaking of the past : @entity2 was in charge of the @entity21 in @entity22 in 2002 , just months after the september 11 terrorist attacks , and said @entity24 seems to be handling security threats well ‘ this is a time for @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 - a long list - @entity32			1
there are a lot of folks who should have the chance to be our nominee and i 'm going to support the one who gets the prize , ’ he said			0
@entity2 ’s visit to the @entity43 set came in conjunction with the mounting security fears for the winter olympics that begin in a few short weeks in @entity24 near the @entity47			2
the former @entity49 governor was in charge of the 2002 @entity5 which presented their own set of security challenges given that they were held just months after the september 11 terrorist attacks			1
in spite of the disapproval he touted against @entity24 throughout the 2012 campaign , @entity2 was very complimentary of the @entity24 government ’s efforts to secure the site and did his best to reassure any anxious viewers , saying he would ' absolutely ' bring his family to the @entity62			1
‘ there 's never been a games that i know of that has been so targeted for specific threats as you 're seeing at @entity68			0
at the same time , the level of security preparations appears to be at an unprecedented level , ’ @entity2 said			2
‘ i believe the @entity62 will be safe			2
that does n’t mean there ’s a 100 per cent guarantee anywhere in the world today			0
but this is , after all , a dangerous corner of the world			0
changing tune : in spite of his harsh rhetoric against @entity24 during the 2012 campaign , @entity2 said that they were taking ever possible precaution in the lead up to the @entity85 ‘ the specific threats that have been leveled suggest that this is an area that could be targeted and therefore there 's a degree of risk associated with , well frankly life today in a world where terrorism exists			1
’ @entity2 said that while the warnings about the @entity96 terrorists and other specific women that appear to pose a threat to the safety of the @entity62 may come as shocking and scary to some , he sees them as examples of the efficiency of the organizers			1
new priorities : rather than running again , @entity2 said he is happy to have the extra time with his sons and family ‘ @entity110 intelligence work - that 's what happened with our games that gave me confidence that they 'd be safe , ’ he said			1
‘ now and then we 'll hear reports of an individual they 're looking for - that suggests they have pretty good intelligence so all in all , it seems to be a very effective security program , but again , no 100 per cent guarantee			2
’ one point that he parsed out was that he has a high level of confidence of the security at the ‘ hard sites ’ where the physical events will take place , keeping the athletes and spectators safe during the tournaments , but soft sites will remain an issue - just as they do throughout the world - because there is no way for security officials to check everyone in public areas			0
‘ terrorists can move almost wherever they want to go			0
it only takes one person to go through a sieve of some kind and so a place like @entity68 can be surrounded if you will , ’ @entity2 said			0
‘ i think that people can recognize that the hard sites and the athletes will be safe and spectators when they 're in the venues will be safe but it ’s the soft places that you ca n’t be 100 per cent certain will be entirely safe , but my guess is that @entity24 have done everything humanly possible to protect the @entity62			1
’ he maintained that while he still views @entity24 as a ‘ geopolitical adversary ’ of the @entity162 and the world since ‘ their friends are some of the world 's worst actors ’ that is not justification enough to keep the @entity62 away from the country			2
‘ i do n’t think you hold off particular countries based upon their politics , ’ he said			0
lighter moments : @entity174 is shown messing with @entity2 's seemingly immovable mane at one point flirty : @entity2 is shown tapping @entity174 's derriere in a tender moment of the film , which begins streaming on january 24 and was shot over the course of the entire campaign he did wade into the so - called @entity184 scandal that is gripping @entity162 domestic politics , however , taking a firm line of support for his ' close friend ' @entity27			1
@entity2 's camp considered the @entity191 governor as a possible vice presidential candidate and selected @entity27 to give the coveted keynote speech at the @entity194 and ended up selecting @entity196 senator @entity195 instead			1
he reaffirmed his statement that there are no hard feelings between the two and that he believes that @entity27 has handled the multiple scandals facing him as he gets off to a rocky start in his second term			0
' i 've been in touch with @entity27 and frankly what i think we 've seen is a strong leader who took responsibility , he fired people who were responsible for the scandal and he has moved on as a leader and i do believe the @entity162 people want to see a strong leader in the @entity215 and he is , ' @entity2 said			1
the interview this morning also coincided with the release of a documentary about his presidential campaign , appropriately titled ' @entity2 ' , on @entity220 today			1
the filmmaker , @entity221 , followed @entity2 and his family for six years as part of the making of the film , and though he was overall pleased with the final product , @entity2 said he was surprised by the fact that more personal moments between he and his wife and the family prayer sessions were included			1
' there were some scenes i kinda wish he would n't have included			0
there are couple scenes where we 're praying for instance and i knew he was in the room but i did n't think he was actually filming during our prayer , ' he said			0
' gosh darn it he captured all that and then he had the chutzpah to actually use it ! ' ' most of it 's kind of fun as i watch my sons and my grandchildren and daughters - in - law interacting and supporting a guy who was under the microscope			0
' visit @entity251 for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy			0

@entity2 said that @entity24 appears to be making every effort to ensure the @entity5 are safe for athletes and spectators
said that it is a good sign that they are releasing the names and pictures of specific terror threats because that suggests they have strong intelligence
the former @entity7 presidential candidate was in charge of the @entity62 in 2002 , months after the september 11 attacks
talked about how he has been in touch with his ' good friend ' @entity27 and thinks he has handled ' @entity184 ' well by showing strong leadership
is *disappointed* that the documentary about his 2012 campaign included clips of his family praying
