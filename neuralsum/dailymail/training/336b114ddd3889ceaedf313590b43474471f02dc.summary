' they did n’t accept it was going to be a natural death			2
' mr @entity168 added that he hopes to exhume mr @entity12 's body within ‘ the next few weeks ’ from @entity5 ’s @entity178 and that an analysis of the content of his stomach could take place afterwards			1
mr @entity168 said : ' i have had one cyanide death in 4,500 autopsies so they are unusual , as are exhumations			2
to have a case where there is both is very unusual			0
' mr @entity12 emigrated to the @entity13 during the 1980s from @entity14 , and through hard work and discipline , saved up enough cash to open first one and eventually three dry cleaning shops in @entity5			1
last june he paid $ 60 for two lottery scratch - off tickets at a @entity198 convenience store near his home and , upon scratching the second one , reportedly leaped in the air and shouted , ' i hit a million ! ' days later , with his wife and daughter at his side at the same store , mr @entity12 gleefully accepted an oversized , mock check from lottery officials			1
at the time , he said he was going to use the money to pay bills , donate to @entity210 in @entity5 and grow his dry - cleaning business			2
after taxes , the prize money amounted to $ 425,000			2

he said : ' mr @entity12 would buy an entire book of scratchcards and would leave them with me the next morning and ask me to work out how much he had won			1
' that lasted about two months then he realised he had to slow down			0
' he started getting addicted to it and he said he had to stop as he was a working person and a family man			0
a lot of the times he would come in his wife would come together with him			0
' @entity247 , a poison expert whose book ' @entity250 ' is being made into a @entity252 tv series , said that mr @entity12 would have been in ' absolute agony ' and likely coughed up blood as he was killed			1
a former chemist , miss @entity247 said : ' a good lethal dose of cyanide will kill you in 10 minutes			0
a mid range dose and people die within the hour			0
for a poison that 's pretty fast			2
' cyanide poisoning is a nasty death			2
there is an enzyme which allows your cells to breathe and the cyanide wipes that enzyme out			0
it suffocates you cell by cell			0
symptoms include seizures , extreme shortness of breath and usually cardiac arrest			0
' there is something known as a ' cyanide scream ' where your muscles are contracting , so this could be what mr @entity12 ’s relatives heard			1
' miss @entity247 added that cyanide would have had a bitter taste and that the best way to disguise it would be to put it into spicy food			0
a mere 200mg would be enough to take somebody 's life , and that could be obtained from pesticides or certain kinds of rat poison			2
historically , money is a ' good reason ' why people poison , miss @entity247 explained			0
she said : ' in the 19th century they used to call cyanide ' inheritance powder ' because so many people used it to get their inheritance early			0
' people also poison to punish , such as getting revenge on their boss , or to end a relationship that they want out of			0
' @entity311 are unique killers because they are never impulsive			0
' there 's always an element of calculation , and they think they will get away with it - just as nearly happened in this case			0
' ms @entity11 earlier told the @entity125 : ' by @entity320 's grace , he was a workaholic			1
day or night ... he picks up the phone 24/7			0
he made the clients happy by doing his job			0
he could not be everywhere , but he had to be everywhere			0
' @entity326 spokeswoman @entity325 confirmed the department was now investigating the death			0
