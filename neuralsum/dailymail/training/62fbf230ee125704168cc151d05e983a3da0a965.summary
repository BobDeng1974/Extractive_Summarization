by @entity1 reporter published : 08:05 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 21 march 2013 a man charged with killing a woman and raping her 10 - year - old daughter after a carjacking at a @entity7 mall last week was able to remove his court - ordered electronic monitoring bracelet before carrying out the brutal attacks			1
a senior probation officer told a @entity7 court earlier this week that @entity13 , 29 , managed to cut the device from his ankle and put it back together so quickly that it did n't prompt @entity17 , the company in @entity18 that makes the monitors , to notify court officers in @entity21			1
now an expert in offender tracking technologies has spoken out to say the blame in this case lies not with the tracking device , but with the protocols of the pretrial unit assigned to monitor @entity13			1
expert @entity29 denies that the gps device could have been at fault in the case of @entity13 , right , who has been charged with first - degree rape , murder and kidnapping , as well as second - degree murder ‘ as soon as the ankle bracelet comes off the ankle , it creates an event			1
but the pretrial services in @entity21 decided , for some reason , to not make it an alert unless an event persisted for some period of time , ’ said @entity29 , president of corrections technology firm @entity37 ‘ there was a hole in the security fence and someone found it and walked right through it , ’ @entity29 told @entity48			0
‘ they should close that hole			0
’ in the federal court system , 51,170 defendants have been supervised on pretrial relief in the past 12 months , with nearly 9,000 defendants placed on electronic monitoring			0
@entity29 said in the vast majority of those cases a @entity63 bracelet is a perfectly acceptable means of monitoring suspects but it had been a bad choice in the case of @entity13			1
according to chief @entity70 probation officer @entity70 , officers had told @entity17 not to notify them when the ankle monitor 's signal was interrupted for a short period of time because the officers had been getting tampering alerts every time the devices were knocked against bathtubs or walls			1
‘ we finally figured out that the circuit can be interrupted because of something as simple and innocent as that , ’ @entity70 told @entity80			0
since the incident @entity17 has admitted to @entity70 that this is n’t the first time someone had tampered with one of its monitors this way			0
the company ’s contract is being reviewed by the @entity94 @entity93 in @entity95 as a result of this incident			0
a tracking device similar to the one @entity13 removed from this ankle on thursday evening before he allegedly killed a school librarian and raped a 10 - year - old girl probation officers did n’t know @entity13 had slipped their leash until more than two hours after state police say he attacked school librarian @entity105 and her daughter outside @entity107 , tied up @entity105 , raped the girl , stabbed @entity105 in her car and fled on foot as the girl ran away			1
when @entity13 was arrested shortly after police said he killed @entity105 , he was not wearing the ankle monitor , which he had left at his home to prevent it from sounding an alarm			1
there was no alert to probation officers from @entity17 until 11:30 p.m. that only occurred because the monitor had n’t moved in more than four hours			0
at 12:30 friday morning , state police alerted @entity70 that @entity13 had been arrested			1
in 2003 , @entity17 , also known as ' @entity120 , ' was found to be partly responsible for the death of a @entity123 woman who was killed by an ex-boyfriend who snipped off his ankle bracelet			2
@entity17 paid the woman ’s family $ 200,000 , according to news reports			0
@entity13 was beaten and suffered a broken nose during his first night in jail , authorities said			1
when he appeared in federal court on friday to face a probation violation charge , he had a swollen face and tissues stuffed up both nostrils			0
his attorneys , @entity138 and @entity139 , said @entity13 was assaulted by other inmates at the @entity141 , where he was taken following his arrest			2
sheriff @entity143 said he was looking into why @entity13 was put into a holding area with other prisoners - not the usual practice in holding someone facing such accusations			2
suspect : @entity149 lead @entity13 out of the @entity151 state police barracks friday , march 15 , 2013			1
@entity13 , 29 , abducted a school librarian and her daughter as they left a gymnastics class @entity156 said @entity13 has been segregated from other prisoners and is being watched around the clock			2
' we 're dealing with a man who is innocent until proven guilty , ' he said			0
' he 's got to be protected			0
' @entity13 was arraigned friday morning at a court in @entity162 on charges that he abducted the mother and daughter as they left a gymnastics class in the @entity21 suburb of @entity168			1
police said @entity13 raped the girl and stabbed the mother to death before fleeing into some woods			1
the 10 - year - old girl escaped and was found by a passing motorist , who dialed 911			0
@entity13 was captured a short time later			1
he had abducted the school librarian and her daughter as they left a gymnastics class at a mall in the @entity21 suburb of @entity168 , about 150 miles west of @entity179 , on thursday night			0
@entity13 bound both victims , raped the girl and drove a short distance to a spot where the girl escaped and was found by a passing motorist , troopers said			1
the motorist told 911 dispatchers he saw a man running away from the scene , allowing police to quickly send in officers on the ground and a sheriff 's helicopter in the air			2
@entity13 was caught a short time later near a wooded area			1
they believe @entity13 tied up the woman and the girl and then raped the 10 - year - old in a deserted area of the mall parking lot shortly before 9pm on march 14			2
it was unclear how the girl escaped or when her mother was killed , authorities said			0
police are still piecing together the timeline of the crime , but their best guess is that after assaulting the girl , @entity13 drove down a nearby rural road			1
crime scene : @entity149 investigate a car involved in a fatal carjacking on @entity214 , @entity168 , @entity7 that ’s where they think the woman , 47 , who worked at an elementary school , was stabbed to death			0

following his court appearance , the 29 - year - old suspect was returned to jail , but placed into protective custody			0
@entity13 is also being guarded for now , but he will not be transferred to a different facility			2
the 29 - year - old had been charged in january with possession of child pornography and allowed to remain free under terms that included staying off the internet and away from places including schools , parks and arcades			1
he lost his job at a supermarket , moved in with his mother and had n't been able to find other work after his arrest , according to court documents			0
according to an @entity257 criminal complaint , agents who went to the @entity151 apartment where @entity13 was living in june found in his bedroom four computers that he told them he used to view adult pornography			2
agent @entity261 said @entity13 eventually admitted using the internet for the past six years to download child porn to a drive on one of the machines , which he turned over to the agents			1
technicians determined in november that it had an encrypted hard drive , and @entity261 said @entity13 provided the encryption key			2
agents reviewing the drive in december found about 100 gigabytes of child porn comprising more than 500 videos and more than 3,000 images , according to the complaint			1
among the images were two showing sex acts involving prepubescent girls , said @entity261 , a member of a unit that targets people involved in online exploitation of children			0
@entity13 was charged on january 9 in federal court with possession of child pornography			1
on jan. 29 , a judge granted a prosecutor 's request for an extension of the time required for grand jury action so investigators could continue going over ' numerous items of electric media ' for additional evidence			0
@entity13 , who authorities said had no prior police record , was released after agreeing to stay at home at night with an electronic monitor and away from any place he might encounter children			1
late friday afternoon , state police turned @entity13 over to federal authorities , who will hold him for violating the terms of his release , court documents said			1
@entity310 said the cases against him will continue in federal and state courts			0
