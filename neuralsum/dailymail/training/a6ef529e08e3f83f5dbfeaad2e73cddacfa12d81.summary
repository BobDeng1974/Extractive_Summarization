a 2.4 mile - wide region on the ' head ' of comet @entity2 has been revealed as the spot for the daring landing of @entity8 's @entity7 probe			1
the high - risk manoeuvre , if successful , will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet			2
scientists at mission control in @entity16 hope the spider - like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of @entity23 's water and perhaps even life			1
an inset showing a close up of the landing site is also shown but they 've warned that the landing should be seen as an ' exciting extra ' on the @entity39 as the mission carries a ' high risk '			0
@entity42 is currently travelling through space some 273 million miles ( 440 million km ) from @entity23			2
the relatively smooth landing region , identified for the moment simply by the letter ' j ' , is located on the smaller of the duck - shaped comet 's two lobes			1
a further back up site has been chosen on the larger of @entity50 's lobes , and is currently being marked by @entity51 with the letter ' c '			1
close - up of @entity7 ’s primary landing site @entity29 , which is located on the ‘ head ’ of @entity56 – @entity57			1
@entity29 offers the minimum risk to the lander in comparison to the other candidate sites , and is also scientifically interesting , with signs of activity nearby at @entity66 , the majority of slopes are less than 30º relative to the local vertical , reducing the chances of @entity7 toppling over during touchdown			1
@entity66 also appears to have relatively few boulders , and receives sufficient daily sunlight to recharge @entity7 and continue science operations when its battery runs out the @entity8 probe will launch its @entity7 robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles ( 10km ) to @entity50			1
the 220lb ( 100kg ) lander will reach the surface on 11 november			1
it will take around seven hours to descend			0
during the descent , images will be taken and other observations of the comet 's environment will be made			1
@entity7 will make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace , using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface			1
once the lander touches down , it will make a 360 ° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed			0
the initial science phase will then begin , with other instruments analysing the plasma and magnetic environment , and the surface and subsurface temperature			0
the lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface , delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis			0
the interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards @entity8			2
the announcement follows weeks of studying the comet , in the hopes of finding an ideal location to land the probe as minimal damage as possible			0
if successful , the 220lb ( 100kg ) lander will reach the surface on 11 november , where it will perform in - depth measurements on the comet			1
' as we have seen from recent close - up images , the comet is a beautiful but dramatic world – it is scientifically exciting , but its shape makes it operationally challenging , ' says @entity129 , @entity130			0
' none of the candidate landing sites met all of the operational criteria at the 100 per cent level , but @entity66 is clearly the best solution			0
' at @entity29 , the majority of slopes have an angle less than 30º , reducing the chances of @entity7 toppling over during touchdown			2
@entity66 also appears to have relatively few boulders , and receives sufficient daily sunlight to recharge @entity7 and continue science operations on the surface beyond the initial battery - powered phase			1
@entity147 was chosen as a backup because of more sunlight hours and fewer boulders			0
but even the flat surface chosen contains potentially dangerous boulders and cracks			2
the @entity8 probe will launch its @entity7 robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles ( 10km )			1
the reconstructed - colour image , taken about 10 days ago , indicates how dark the comet appears			0
on the average , the comet 's surface reflects about four per cent of impinging visible light , making it as dark as coal this 3d image of @entity7 ’s primary landing site on the ‘ head ’ of @entity56 – @entity57 can be viewed using stereoscopic glasses with red – green / blue filters @entity147 was chosen as the backup site for @entity8 ’s lander @entity7 during the @entity173 meeting held on 13 – 14 september 2014			1
the image was taken by @entity8 at a distance of about 43 miles ( 70km ) if all goes to plan , @entity7 will then make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace , using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface			1
according to @entity51 , this is a ' one - shot opportunity ' and real - time radio control will be impossible due to the incredible distance of the comet from @entity23			2
the entire landing process is expected to take seven hours , and if successful , will represent a historic moment in space exploration			0
' we will make the first ever in situ analysis of a comet at this site , giving us an unparalleled insight into the composition , structure and evolution of a comet , ' says @entity199 , a lead lander scientist			2
' @entity29 in particular offers us the chance to analyse pristine material , characterise the properties of the nucleus , and study the processes that drive its activity			0
' several different surface regions are shown in this map , which is oriented with the comet 's ' body ' in the foreground and the ' head ' in the background			1
the map was used to help researchers pick a suitable place to drop a lander in november the original five candidate landing sites for @entity39 ’s lander @entity7 , and with the backup , @entity147 , indicated the race to find the landing site could only begin once @entity39 arrived at the comet on 6 august , when the comet was seen close - up for the first time			1
since then , the spacecraft has moved to within 18 miles ( 30km ) of the comet , allowing more detailed scientific measurements of the candidate sites			0
' there 's no time to lose , but now that we 're closer to the comet , continued science and mapping operations will help us improve the analysis of the primary and backup landing sites , ' says @entity8 flight director @entity238			1
' of course , we can not predict the activity of the comet between now and landing , and on landing day itself			0
' a sudden increase in activity could affect the position of @entity8 in its orbit at the moment of deployment and in turn the exact location where @entity7 will land , and that 's what makes this a risky operation			1
' during the descent , images will be taken and other observations of the comet 's environment will be made			2
zoom in on the image below to find out where @entity8 is at the moment the @entity8 probe will launch its @entity7 robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles ( 10km ) to @entity50			1
if all goes to plan , @entity7 will then make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace @entity39 took an incredible selfie of its 131ft ( 40 metre ) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week			0
in the background is the duck - shaped comet , @entity42 , with its distinct ' head ' and ' body ' clearly visible once the lander touches down , it will make a 360 ° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed			2
the initial science phase will then begin , with other instruments analysing the plasma and magnetic environment , and the surface and subsurface temperature			0
the lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface , delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis			0
the interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards @entity8			2
' no one has ever attempted to land on a comet before , so it is a real challenge , ' says @entity298 , @entity299 mission manager			0
' the complicated ' double ' structure of the comet has had a considerable impact on the overall risks related to landing , but they are risks worth taking to have the chance of making the first ever soft landing on a comet			0
' comets are time capsules containing primitive material left over from the epoch when the sun and its planets formed			0
by studying the gas , dust and structure of the nucleus and organic materials associated with the comet , via both remote and in situ observations , the @entity8 mission should become the key to unlocking the history and evolution of our solar system			0

instead of imaging a bright , ice - covered comet , the probe ’s instruments have detected that @entity50 is in fact darker than charcoal			1

the region , named site @entity29 , is around 2.4 miles ( 4km ) at its widest point
a back - up site , site c , has also been revealed on comet 's larger lobe
sites were chosen as they are relatively flat and gain more sunlight
@entity8 will launch @entity7 robot 6 miles ( 10km ) from comet @entity50
the 220lb ( 100kg ) lander will reach the comet 's surface on 11 november
spider - like probe could answer questions on the origin of life on @entity23
