sitting in the casualty department of one of the best - known hospitals in @entity4 , i ca n’t help but notice it ’s packed to the rafters			1
yet it ’s not a hectic saturday night , but a monday lunchtime at the beginning of december and everyone seems sober			1
despite this , i struggle to find a seat , even though it is obvious i ’m in deep shock and on the point of passing out in agony			1
this is by far the worst pain i ’ve ever suffered			1
i know my upper arm is broken — i fell off a step and heard the crack — and fully expect at least a four - hour wait			1
a woman having a cigarette outside warned me as i arrived : ‘ hope you ’ve set aside the whole day			1
i ’ve been waiting ages ! ’ @entity27 ( pictured ) fell off a step and broke her arm , she was treated at @entity31 's @entity30 as i look around the crowd , i see little evidence of painful injury			1
i ask the woman next to me what she ’s come for — a headache , no less			1
‘ no point calling the @entity40			1
you can never get seen , ’ she says			1
it ’s the same story with the worried - looking father a few rows back			1
with a feverish young son lying listlessly on his lap , he explains he came straight to the hospital			1
he did n’t even think to start with his gp			1
it ’s clear evidence that casualty is becoming the first port of call whether it ’s an accident , emergency or just feeling a bit poorly			1
no wonder the staff at the @entity30 in @entity31 look so strained			1
my worries about a long wait are mercifully unfounded — obviously , a genuine crisis is attended to as a priority			1
within 20 minutes i see a triage nurse and am sent for an x-ray			1
a broken humerus is confirmed and i ’m sent home wearing a sling with the hope the break is clean and will begin to mend			1
i ’m to see the consultant the following week in the fracture clinic			1
so far , for a badly injured woman in her 60s , so good			1
it ’s been a long time since i was an emergency case			1
it was the early nineties			1
i ’d slipped down a set of stairs and not so much broke , as demolished , my ankle			1
i recall a quick consultation , instant admission , pins and screws and a two - week stay with good care			2
but , as i was to discover , it ’s a very different story now			1
i ’ve always been a staunch supporter of the @entity85 , a service that was introduced just two years before my birth in 1950 , and made all the difference in the world to my parents ’ peace of mind			1
for the first time in their lives , they did n’t have to worry about paying for the inoculations — polio , diphtheria and smallpox — that were now available to every child , free of charge			2
it never occurred to me to consider private medicine as i got older			2
i had my two sons on the @entity85 and received kind , attentive and sympathetic care before , during and after birth			1
when i was diagnosed with breast cancer nearly ten years ago , i was given a speedy referral by an excellent gp and instant admission for a mastectomy into the @entity114 in @entity115			1
the surgical care was first rate and there was never a shortage of nurses to attend to me			1
i ’ve defended the @entity85 to any critic			1
free health care at the point of need seems to me the very essence of a caring community			2
‘ so what , ’ i ’ve said testily to people complaining about the wait in a clinic for a post-operative cancer check - up			1
‘ you ’re getting top - class treatment for free ! what have you got to whinge about ? ’ but now i ’m worried that this precious service is in danger of imploding			1
admittedly , my casualty experience at the @entity30 was faultless and , a week later , when i attend the fracture clinic , i have nothing to complain about			1
the wait was no more than half an hour , the x-ray pretty quick			2
i was to be admitted on the wednesday evening and was told to get my necessary blood tests done in advance			2
and that ’s when the trouble started			2
the blood test queue filled a large waiting room and stretched , snake - like , along the corridor			2
my number was 365 — and 210 had just been called			2
it was two - and - a half hours before they got to me			2
just as well i ’d set the whole day aside			2
wednesday came and i still had no information about when and where , or indeed if , i should turn up that evening			2
they had n’t a clue			2
i emailed the surgeon ’s secretary , and at 5pm i finally had a call			2
i was to arrive at the orthopaedic ward around 7.30pm			2
they ’d finally found me a bed			2
the nurses could not have been more welcoming or attentive , but i soon learned that the chief nurse in the department had been on duty since 8am			2
it was now going on for 8.30pm , and when the consultant popped by , he casually suggested she might consider going home at some point			2
@entity27 was diagnosed with a broken humerus , she has long been a supporter of the @entity85 especially after the care she received when she was suffering from breast cancer nearly ten years ago i think the poor thing finally left around 10pm			1
i got the impression 14 - hour shifts were far from unusual			0
the staff nurse who came to check me before lights out looked equally exhausted			0
he was @entity182 and told me he ’d be the only qualified nurse on duty overnight , with the support of three or four health care assistants , in charge of 16 patients			0
most of thursday was a blur			0
anaesthetic , surgery , recovery and then a room on the cardiac ward to monitor me overnight because no beds were available in orthopaedics			0
after a blissful night on morphine , i was moved to the general ward , still in the cardiac department , to be tended by a group of half a dozen nurses and health care assistants			0
they were rushed off their feet , making sure everyone — four in my room and a number of other bays — was washed , fed , watered and taken to the toilet			0
no patient was left wanting , but the staff looked as if they should be the ones in bed			0
and then there was @entity215			0
she was in the next bed			0
she was in her late 70s , had suffered a heart attack and was obviously not in full control of her mental faculties			0
she shouted constant abuse at the nurses who tried their best for her			0
@entity27 admitted that her casualty experience at the @entity30 ( pictured ) was faultless and , a week later , when she attended the fracture clinic , the wait was no more than half an hour she was especially troublesome at night , so i and the other two women — a hotel proprietor from @entity231 with a rare heart condition and a quiet elderly woman — did n’t get much sleep			1
@entity215 ’s finest hour came around 3am on my fifth and final night			0
she shouted more abuse at the nurses , insisting on getting out of bed			0
i got up and walked to the corridor for a break and a cup of hot chocolate , when a mug flew past my ears and smashed against the wall			0
more were thrown around the ward : @entity215 had been saving them up , hiding them who knows where , for a major assault			0
three huge security men did n’t know what to do as she rampaged			0
i suggested to a distraught young nurse to call psychiatry			0
a doctor arrived after about half an hour — it ’s a huge hospital — as we all looked on in horror at the sight of @entity215 losing it			0
she was given a drastic chemical cosh and it worked			0
i ’m sure the young nurses are used to dealing with crises , but even they seemed shocked and at a loss to know how to deal with such violence			0
next morning , when i woke and made my way to the loo , the @entity231 woman warned me : ‘ do n’t go in there ! ’ at some point in the night , @entity215 had managed a dirty protest in the bathroom			0
she should never have been in a room with other patients			0
i do n’t know why she was n’t in a room of her own			0
shortage of beds and staff again , i guess			0
when i left , i was discharged by a junior doctor who did not give me any paperwork to tell me what would happen next			0
i had to ping off another email to the consultant ’s secretary again to find out			0
i needed the @entity40 to trim stitches and should have physiotherapy after four weeks , she said			0
i wonder how many patients leave in ignorance because they do n’t know who or how to ask ? i will continue to support the principle of the @entity85			1
i certainly wo n’t be arguing in favour of paying £ 5 to been seen in casualty , as some have suggested			1
@entity30 at the point of need is what we are so proud to maintain			0
but investment in staff is unquestionably a priority			0
these nurses are desperate to do a good job , but there are too few of them to service the need			0
i would plead with anyone who feels ill to make their first port of call their gp so that emergency departments can do the job they ’re set up to do ; deal with emergencies			0
as for the shortage of beds , we must have effective social and convalescent care to end bed - blocking			0
and those overworked nurses ? let ’s stop picking holes in this magnificent service we are privileged to have at our disposal , and say a collective thank you to those working so hard			0
ladies and gentlemen , i sincerely hope i do n’t see any one of you again , for a long , long time , but you have my gratitude and admiration			0
i hope it sustains you through tonight ’s 14 - hour shift			0
@entity215 ’s name has been changed .			0

@entity27 has been a *longstanding* supporter of the @entity85 and it 's treatment
she says she received first rate treatment for breast cancer ten years ago
however her recent trip to casualty showed her a different side to the story
