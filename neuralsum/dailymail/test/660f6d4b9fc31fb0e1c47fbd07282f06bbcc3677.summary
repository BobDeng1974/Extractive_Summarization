@entity1 ’s first - half finish kept @entity2 slim dreams of promotion alive and helped push 10 - man @entity5 to the brink of relegation after a tense clash at the @entity10			1
@entity1 popped up unmarked early on to bundle home and the result leaves @entity5 on the verge of dropping into @entity16 football ’s third - tier after a dreadful season			1
to make matters worse , the @entity18 will have to face @entity20 next weekend without star man @entity21 who received his marching orders in injury - time for a second bookable offence			1
@entity24 's @entity1 ( right ) celebrates scoring the winner in a 1 - 0 defeat of @entity5 the @entity18 had @entity21 sent off for a second bookable offence in jury time @entity5 : @entity29 ; @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 ; @entity33 , @entity34 ( @entity35 79 ) , @entity36 ( @entity37 56 ) , @entity38 , @entity39 ; @entity21 , @entity40 ( @entity41 68 ) subs not used : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity35 , @entity46 booked : @entity33 , @entity47 , @entity37 , @entity21 ( sent off ) wolves : @entity49 ; @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ( c ) , @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 82 ) ; @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 82 ) subs not used : @entity64 , @entity63 , @entity65 , van @entity66 , @entity68 booked : @entity50 , @entity52 and @entity60 scorer : @entity70 25 referee : @entity72 attendance : 16,810 the @entity18 now have to hope @entity74 fail against @entity75 on tuesday and @entity76 next weekend while they win at @entity77 on the last day of the season			1
@entity5 ’s dire position represents a spectacular downfall for the north - west club who lifted the @entity83 just 712 days ago and who spent eight entertaining years in the @entity85 between 2005 and 2013			2
they once seemed to brilliantly punch above their weight in @entity90 ’s top - flight but they have slipped into despair after using three managers and 42 players across this season			0
and , worryingly enough for their fans , if they do go down an uncomfortable summer involving an expected player exodus will almost certainly be on the cards			0
yet this clash was not all about the home side as @entity70 also ensured that @entity2 fans can still dream of a @entity104 ending to this season – but only just			0
the stakes for both sides in this clash could hardly have been higher as @entity109 ’s visitors needed three points to keep up their late scramble for a play - off spot although that now looks unlikely as they would need three points and a huge goal swing on the last day to make it into the top six			0
afobe races past @entity5 's @entity38 as the visitors kept their hopes of promotion alive @entity5 defender @entity33 drops to his knees as the former @entity83 winners head towards the drop @entity124 , the former @entity5 captain parachuted into the managerial hotseat following @entity128 ’s sacking earlier this month , again called for the club ’s fans to meet and greet his squad at the players ’ carpark before the match to let them know how much survival meant			1
a healthy handful did just that but their pleas fell on deaf ears in a clash that just about summed up @entity5 ’s entire season			0
they home side dominated the opening moments and looked up for the challenge of beating the odds – and the drop – and @entity21 should have scored when he swivelled and shot from close range after seven minutes			2
@entity124 ’s influence on @entity5 has been immediate and they are playing far better football than witnessed earlier this year under either @entity152 or @entity128			0
but killer instinct is in short supply – and it showed			0
former @entity155 star @entity40 was the next to test @entity2 defence as his deflected effort only just went over the bar after 12 minutes but the home side were then undone shortly after with the kind of goal that underlines the chronic defensive frailties that have so affected this term			2
a @entity57 free - kick from the edge of the box was brilliantly met by @entity70 who could not miss from three yards out as @entity5 ’s defence stood and watched			1
as news filtered around the @entity10 that @entity171 were losing at @entity172 , and that @entity2 were just a point outside the top - six as a consequence , @entity109 ’s side looked to press home their advantage against a @entity5 side that played attractively without any real penetration			1
however , neither side created any real clear - cut chances and both goalkeepers spent the remainder of the first half as spectators			0
after the break , @entity5 again began fresher as they knew they had 45 minutes to realistically save their season and although @entity21 , @entity40 and @entity39 tried to link up and break down @entity2 , they again lacked any real cutting edge			1
@entity5 's @entity31 and @entity5 's @entity188 head off dejected after the final whistle @entity5 supporters begin to come to terms with the fact that relegation is out of their hands however , it was the same at both ends with @entity60 and @entity57 both having little say in the game and although @entity1 did find the back of the net after 57 minutes , his handball in the build - up was spotted by the referee who disallowed the effort			1
with half an hour to go , @entity2 should have been 2 - 0 up but @entity5 had keeper @entity29 to thank for blocking @entity60 as he ran through on goal			1
and @entity29 was also at his best soon after when @entity70 ’s corner was superbly flicked goalwards by @entity54 but the former @entity208 brilliantly tipped over to keep the @entity18 in the contest			0
his team - mates responded to his efforts by launching a late charge at @entity2 with @entity31 and @entity21 both looking to surge forward and get on the scoresheet			2
both sets of players observe a minute 's silence to mark the anniversary of the @entity219 stadium fire last week , when @entity5 threw caution to the wind against @entity223 they were rewarded with a late three points and they tried the same again in this match but they could not quite manage it			2
and when @entity21 picked up a second yellow in the dying moments , @entity5 ’s hopes left the field with him			2
both these teams can still get what they want out of this season			0
and next saturday will have to be really , truly remarkable if that is to happen .			0

@entity2 hopes of @entity238 promotion remain after defeat of @entity5
@entity1 scored the winner after *layching* on to @entity57 's free - kick
the @entity18 had star player @entity21 sent in injury time
