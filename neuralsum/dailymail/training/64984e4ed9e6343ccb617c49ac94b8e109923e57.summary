by @entity0 published : 12:22 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 06:52 est , 16 september 2013 from deepest , darkest @entity1 , @entity2 is plotting to take over the fashion world			2
and if she 's not , she should be after unveiling a collection that put @entity6 's wackier elements firmly in their place			2
@entity2 made her name with bohemian flowing dresses and while the odd blast of boho still crops up , by and large , this was a romantically grown - up vision that will please urban girls and country ladies alike			1
shimmering silk - organza gowns in cream and blush pink gave way to darkly dramatic dresses dressed up with fringed capes and festooned with neatly embroidered flowers			1
there was a dash of purple print too , on frocks that had more than a hint of @entity42 era @entity40 about them , and a surprisingly successful attempt to combine loud leopard print with feminine florals			2
florals reappeared again , this time as a delicate pale pink print blooming across a neat oat - coloured tea dress and once more on a show - stopping bias cut gown of the sort @entity2 does so well			0
most of all though , the overwhelming impression was of pink , pink and more pink			0
@entity2 had clearly taken inspiration from legendary @entity59 editor @entity58 , who famously exhorted readers to ' think pink '			0
it certainly worked at @entity63			1
@entity2 's offering was unabashedly pretty - and should make some of next summer 's brides happy art : @entity68 style blooms on the catwalk at @entity63 purple reign : blooms get a graphic makeover stunning : a gorgeous leopard print skirt on the runway show - stoppers : @entity2 's trademark flowing gowns appeared embroidered with flowers in silk and organza despite the success of her trailing show stoppers , @entity2 hared off in a new direction with her shorter offerings , which came with structured @entity86 skirts and nipped in waists			1
better still were her beautifully cut column gowns , a world away from the folksy efforts of earlier collections , which added a shot of 30s elegance to the collection			1
one narrow - skirted effort in a winning combination of rose , pale pink and black silk looked more @entity100 than @entity2 - and it was all to the credit of the designer			1
best of all though , were the skirts			0
@entity2 does n't really do trousers but she does maxis like she means them and that was certainly the case here			0
@entity109 gently puffed animal print or inky ruched tulle , @entity2 's were a tour de force			0
special thanks to @entity113 and @entity114 for driving the @entity116 team around during @entity117 .			0

@entity68 style blooms were *liberally* *splashed* across gowns
shorter dresses had an *unusually* structured feel with nipped in waists
@entity126 dominated the @entity63 palette , whether *powder* , rose or blush
