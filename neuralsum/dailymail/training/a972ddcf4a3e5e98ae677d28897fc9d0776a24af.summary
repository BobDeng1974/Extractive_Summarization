the beauty favourite , of whom @entity12 is their current celebrity ' face ' , held their position on the @entity20 table with a value of £ 7.64billion			2
this is despite the @entity25 - owned brand 's lead having dropped from £ 2.61billion to £ 1.96 billion , following the growth of @entity27 brand @entity6			1
@entity2 beat all other cosmetics brands to the top of the @entity20 table @entity6 has continued its progression up the rankings , having moved from fourth to third last year , it is now second			1
brand value growth of £ 621 million , more than any other brand , means its total brand value is now £ 5.7 billion			2
@entity20 , the leading global brand valuation and marketing experts , calculate their annual list of the top 50 most valuable cosmetics brands using the ' @entity42 approach ' : brand value is essentially the cost that a third party would have to pay to license the use of a brand			1
according to @entity20 , @entity6 's success hinges on shrewd exploitation of its @entity27 heritage			1
@entity27 's nation brand is synonymous with luxury , helping to drive £ 17billion worth of luxury goods exports in 2012			2
the brand , whose ' face ' is currently @entity57 , has contributed to this trend , targeting emerging markets such as @entity60 and @entity61 to achieve revenue growth of 12 per cent last year			2
the results table detailing the most valuable cosmetics brands @entity6 is followed in the @entity20 50 by @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity65 , which have all recovered well from brand value falls last year			1
sixth - placed @entity67 is this year 's biggest casualty			0
down from second last year , it has lost £ 1.76billion of brand value this year			0
the £ 1.5billion lost last year means @entity67 's brand value is down £ 3.26billion on 2011 and now stands at just £ 3.4billion			0
the particularly dramatic brand value falls suggest low levels of investor confidence following a revenue drop of five per cent and a loss of £ 27.7million in 2012			0
