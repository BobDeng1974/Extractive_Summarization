children 's soft toys act as a reservoir for bacteria and bring germs into hospitals , scientists have warned			1
a team of researchers at @entity9 in @entity10 explored how best to minimise the risk of infection after surgery			1
they note that despite hand washing and other protocols , surgical - site infections continue to pose a problem			0
children 's toys could act as a reservoir for bacteria and bring germs into hospitals , scientists at @entity9 in @entity10 , have warned the researchers concluded this implied one of two scenarios			1
firstly , that current infection prevention methods are not effective			0
and secondly that there are alternative sources of bacterial exposure to the surgical wound			0
their study revealed that soft toys brought into the operating theatre by children served as a breeding ground for bacteria			2
they urged parents to be aware of the dangers comfort items could pose , and take steps to eradicate the risk			1
dr @entity48 and his team aimed to investigate if cuddly toys contribute to surgical - site infections			2
they swabbed stuffed animals that were brought into hospital by children ahead of surgery			2
the findings revealed that all those soft toys swabbed showed bacterial growth			1
in addition , the researchers demonstrated that a single wash and dry cycle at home , followed by sealing the toy in a plastic bag for 24 hours , effectively ' sterilised ' 79 per cent of those soft toys tested			0
researchers urged parents to wash and sterilise their child 's toys before bringing them into the operating theatre , to help minimise the risk of their child suffering a surgical - site infection the study report states : ' these results indicate that items of comfort , such as stuffed animals , brought into the operating room with a benevolent purpose may represent a reservoir of bacteria that could lead to unwanted surgical - site infections			1
' washing an item of comfort one day before surgery effectively sterilises that item			0
' the researchers note that future studies will be needed to determine the correlation between stuffed animals that test positive for bacteria and surgical - site infections			0
another area to look at is whether giving a child a ' sterile ' soft toy reduces the risk of surgical - site infections .			0

scientists at @entity9 explored how to reduce infection risk
found all stuffed toys they swabbed showed signs of bacteria growth
urged parents to wash and sterilise any cuddly toys before surgery
