professor @entity1 said she had experienced the phenomenon first - hand while making a series called the @entity34			1
she said that ‘ anyone who has done broadcasting for the @entity5 ’ will know that while references to prominent figures in the arts go unchallenged , requests are made for scientific terms to be put into ‘ ordinary language ’			2
professor @entity1 said programme - makers frequently say that their mother would n’t understand complex terminology – but this is no excuse			1
‘ many mothers now have @entity47 so let ’s leave out the mothers			1
’ and , in a reference to the values of @entity53 , the founder of the @entity5 , she said : ‘ in the rising age - groups , 45 per cent of that cohort went to university for goodness sake , so this sort of @entity60 idea that you are having to pre-digest , mash up the difficult stuff and particularly science because people are not able to understand it , is a complete fallacy			0
’ professor @entity1 , who has chaired the @entity68 since 2008 and heads the humanities department at @entity70 , said the problem stemmed from the fact that ‘ everyone at the @entity5 is trained in the humanities ’			1

she added that other broadcasters are also guilty of underestimating their audience			0

@entity5 science presenters professor @entity89 and @entity90 others said that science programmes focus on entertainment at the expense of education			1
professor @entity96 , head of the psychology department at @entity98 , said that when he was making a programme for @entity101 , it was suggested that viewers text in the name of their favourite serial killer			1
