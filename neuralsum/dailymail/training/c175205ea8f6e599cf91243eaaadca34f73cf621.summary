to date , astronomers have found about 1,000 planets in the @entity2 , with just a handful of these thought to be potentially habitable			2
but , in the hunt for @entity8 - like planets , a new study says we should be optimistic - as there may be more than 200 billion in our galaxy alone			1
the remarkable declaration is based on the estimate that the average stars has two @entity8 - like planets in orbit , and the @entity2 has about 100 billion stars			1
@entity19 scientists say our galaxy could be teeming with habitable worlds ( illustration shown )			1
if each star has an average of two planets , there will be 200 billion			1
they base this on a 200 - year - old method called the @entity30 relation			1
this was used to predict some planets in our own solar system the researchers from the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) made the finding using a 200 - year - old method			1
known as the @entity30 relation , it predicts the existence of planets based on their sequence around the sun. it was correctly used to predict the orbits of the dwarf planet ceres and ice giant @entity47 in our own solar system			1
in this case the team look at multi-planet systems that were known to contain at least three planets , as detected by the @entity54 space telescope			0
' we use a generalised @entity30 relation to predict the periods of 228 additional planets in 151 of these @entity54 multiples , ' the researchers wrote			1
using this , they say there are an average of two planets in the habitable zone of each star			1
also known as the goldilocks zone , this is the distance from a star where liquid water , crucial for life , can exist			2
the kepler space telescope is biased towards seeing planets very close to their stars , that are too hot for liquid water , but the team extrapolated from @entity54 's results to make their findings			0
this would suggest that are hundreds of billions of potentially habitable planets in the galaxy that could support life			1
in 1776 , @entity86 astronomer @entity85 wrote that the position planets from the sun - then only confirmed to be just @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity8 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 - could be predicted by a mathematical relation			2
the relation is the number four plus another number , which is zero , three , six , 12 - and so on , doubling each time			2
so , for example , @entity89 is four plus zero ‘ parts ’ from the sun - four in total			0
@entity90 is four plus three - seven - while @entity8 is four plus six - ten - and so on			0
the work was followed up fellow @entity86 @entity104 in 1772			0
he postulated that , using the relation , one noticed a gap in the pattern of the planets			2
he found that , after @entity91 , there was a rather large gap to @entity92			0
‘ can one believe that the founder of the universe had left this space empty ? certainly not , ’ he wrote at the time			0
thus , he predicted the appearance of the dwarf planet @entity116 between @entity91 and @entity92			0
the relation also predicted the orbit of @entity47			0
there is no solid theoretical explanation as to why this law works , although possible explanations involve the orbital resonance of a planetary system - namely , a condition where all the planets are stable			2
its accuracy and use has been called in to question , though			0
in our solar system , it failed to account for the asteroid belt , @entity136 , and many other bodies beyond the orbit of @entity139			1

also known as the goldilocks zone , this is the distance from a star where liquid water , crucial for life , can exist			2
this would suggest that are hundreds of billions of potentially habitable planets in the galaxy ' the ingredients for life are plentiful , and we now know that habitable environments are plentiful , ' said dr @entity167 , from the @entity168 and the @entity169 of @entity170			1
he adds , though , that it remains a mystery why we have still not made contact with an extraterrestrial race , if life is so abundant			1
' the universe is not teeming with aliens with human - like intelligence that can build radio telescopes and space ships			0
otherwise we would have seen or heard from them , ' he said			0
' it could be that there is some other bottleneck for the emergence of life that we have n't worked out yet			0
or intelligent civilisations evolve , but then self - destruct			0
