a mother - of - one has argued that parents should be doing more to teach their children about sex following the news that pupils as young as 11 will be taught the difference between rape and consensual sex in schools			1
education secretary @entity10 said the proposed lessons ( which schools and parents can choose to opt in to ) will better prepare pupils for life in modern @entity15			1
the question over whether such lessons are appropriate led to a heated debate on today 's @entity19 as two women appeared to share their opposing views			2
rather , she believes parents should be taking much more responsibility			0
she said : ' i think it 's entirely inappropriate the kind of conversations we are allowing strangers to have with our children			2
if anybody needs to be having sex education lessons it 's parents			1
' children are becoming sexualised earlier and there is plenty a parent can do			0
first of all , start parenting again			0
parents have handed their children over to computers and smart phones to raise them			2
they have taken their foot off the pedal and that is the issue			0
' children are seeing " pop porn " from @entity56 and @entity57 and we need to be telling children in schools - if anything at all about sex education - that 's it 's about relationships and respecting yourself			1
@entity68 , 33 , a @entity69 counsellor , believes it 's never too early for children to talk about sex ' we are thrusting them into this sexualised world when we do n't need to			1
' she added on the issue of teaching the difference between rape and consensual sex in schools : ' we should not be normalising this for children			1
i am an open - minded mum and i sexually educated my daughter because i am the safest person to do it			0
' however , tv presenter @entity68 , 33 , from @entity26 , who is a @entity69 counsellor , said she believes it 's never too early for children to talk about sex education			1
she said : ' the key word about this is age appropriate			0
it 's not about storming into a classroom and giving children a barrage of information that as adults we find difficult to take in			2
' it 's gently starting that conversation and getting schools on board and parents taking responsibility too so it 's a three way conversation			2
' we know at @entity69 that there is a deficit ( in sex education ) between the ages of six and 11 so these children do n't have the tools and the know how - or where to ask for help - or to know what is wrong			1
' she said that having a proper syllabus is vital to keep children safe and to stop them being misinformed and then spreading myths about sex in the playground			1
under @entity10 's proposal , pupils are to be taught from the age of 11 about the difference between rape and consensual sex			1
the two women debated the issue raised by education secretary @entity10 with tv presenters @entity128 and @entity130 the lessons , which could come in as soon as after the @entity133 holidays , will be based on a series of resources being developed by the @entity136			1
writing in @entity138 to mark @entity139 , the @entity137 mp said : ' we have to face the fact that many pressures girls face today were unimaginable to my generation and it 's our duty to ensure that our daughters leave school able to navigate the challenges and choices they 'll face in adulthood			0
' our commitment to supporting women should start long before they take home their first wage			0
we have to ensure that the education girls receive not only allows them to reach their academic potential , but also prepares them for life in modern @entity15			0
' the recommended materials , which she has stressed will be age appropriate , are aimed at giving teachers more confidence and better guidance to teach difficult subjects			0
the sex education lessons will be based on a series of resources being developed by the @entity136 @entity10 has said ' it 's our duty to ensure that our daughters leave school able to navigate the challenges and choices they 'll face in adulthood ' thousands of this morning viewers took to the show 's @entity173 page to join in the debate			1
@entity176 said she agreed with @entity68 's points and welcomes the move to change sex education in schools			1
she wrote : ' think that 's a great idea			0
in an ideal world it would n't have to happen at all but it 's good to educate children on the difference and make them aware in an age appropriate way			0
' i 'd be more than happy for my child to be taught about this at school			0
' @entity192 also believes it 's a good idea			0
she said : ' they should be taught that anything under the age of 16 is wrong too			0
if they do n't know , then how will they speak out about it ? ' but @entity200 thinks 11 is too young for children to be taught about rape			1
she said : ' 11 - year - olds should not know what sex is			2
you can protect your children from horrible people without going into detail			0
' i would be mortified if my daughter found out what sex was at that age ! sex is for adults not children ! ' @entity218 agreed saying she thinks the proposal takes away childhood innocence			2
she said : ' how can an 11 - year - old process the feelings and emotions that go along with this conversation , we moan about the state our country is in yet we give children responsibilities and emotions they ca n't deal with and wonder why they are stressed , self harming and having mental health problems it 's ridiculous ! they are only children for a short time lets let them be innocent !
