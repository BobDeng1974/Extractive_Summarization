by @entity0 published : 03:44 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 03:54 est , 19 august 2013 the @entity2 military is secretly testing a stealth snowmobile in its northern territories to enable troops to covertly operate in @entity7 conditions			1
soldiers are testing the speed , acceleration , noise and battery endurance of the $ 620,000 machines , designed to be a silent hybrid - electric version of the existing gas - powered transporters			1
clues that the government was seeking to upgrade its @entity7 warfare capabilities were revealed in 2011 when the @entity21 's research and development agency posted a tendering document for a snowmobile machine that could quickly switch to ' silent mode ' when needed			1
stealth - like : @entity2 's military has been testing stealth - like new snowmobiles , similar to existing ones , pictured , but capable of switching to ' silent mode ' to sneak up on the enemy the first tests with the new machines have been carried out in varying snow conditions at @entity32 , according to @entity2 's @entity33 , comparing how the silent snowmobiles perform against their noisier counterparts			1
documents obtained under an @entity37 by the @entity38 revealed the military have been using sound - meter readings to measure the machine 's noise levels ; they have been driving the snowmobiles at a steady speed across varying surfaces to test the batteries ; and the buggy 's acceleration on a 100m flat , snow - packed track has also been assessed			2
it also revealed the new machine has been named the ' @entity52 ' after a mythical norse , shape - shifting god			0
the report , quoted by @entity33 , read : ' the prototype must be at least nearly as capable and reliable as a standard internal combustion snowmobile , while providing a significant noise reduction			2
' for military purposes , it is not enough for a snowmobile to operate quietly			0
' news that @entity2 is pushing ahead with plans to augment its military capabilities in the @entity65 comes at a time when defence spending has been reigned in to make way for measures to stimulate economic growth			2
requirements : ' the prototype must be at least nearly as capable and reliable as a standard internal combustion snowmobile ( pictured ) , while providing a significant noise reduction , ' the defence report stated the @entity21 said spending on @entity7 mobility would be suspended for eight years , however , the stealth snowmobile project appears to have been protected , according to the news service			1
the contract was originally set at $ 550,000 per snowmobile , but the @entity38 obtained the document which shows a revised price tag of nearly $ 620,000			0
the winning bid came from @entity2 firm @entity85			0
while many details of the capabilities of the new military machine have been kept under wraps , news of its arrival have not been met with enthusiasm by all			0
@entity95 , a former federal @entity96 candidate who teaches international law at the @entity98 , told @entity33 he questioned whether it was money well spent when the apparent threat of attack from the @entity65 seems negligible			0
secret tests : the silent snowmobiles are being tested against the noisier versions at the @entity105 , @entity106 ' i do n't see a whole lot of evidence that criminals and terrorists are scooting around @entity2 's @entity65 on snowmobiles and that we have to sneak up on them , ' he said			1
' i ca n't help but wonder whether they 've been watching too many ( @entity118 ) @entity117 movies , ' he added .			0

snowmobiles tested against existing machines for noise , speed , endurance
new machines must be able to easily switch to stealth ' silent mode '
full capabilities of the @entity7 warfare capabilities being kept a secret
