@entity1 boss @entity0 has confirmed his interest in signing @entity4 defender @entity3 , with the @entity5 set to launch a january bid for £ 8million - rated star			1
@entity9 's @entity8 takes a closer look at the 21 - year - old who has been watched by every @entity13 club this season			1
he 's a new name ? yes , he 's only hit the headlines over the past few months following a string of brilliant displays at left back for @entity4 towards the back end of last season and the start of this campaign			0
he certainly has the pace too , his leggy stride eats up the ground effortlessly			0
as is a necessity for all modern - day full - backs , @entity3 is more than adept at joining in attack			2
why do @entity1 need another left back ; they 've already got @entity37 and @entity38 ? good point			0
interestingly though , @entity1 do n't see @entity3 as a long - term left back			1
they have designs on moulding him into a central defender			0
he has been known to fill in at right back , too			0
his versatility is a key selling point for @entity1			0
@entity3 has played most of his football at left back this season but @entity0 wants him to play centrally makes a change for @entity1 not to be signing a youngster from @entity49 ? true			2
but there is a twist ; @entity3 actually started his academy career at @entity53 's joining the @entity49 in 2001 as an eight - year - old			1
but he was forced to leave the south - coast club in 2009			0
he then spent spells at non-league outfits @entity58 and @entity59 before joining @entity4 for £ 10,000 in 2013			1
how much will he cost ? @entity4 are demanding a hefty fee , between £ 8m - £ 10m , for @entity3 next month			1
quite a mark up on the £ 10,000 they paid to bring him to @entity62			2
@entity1 have been made aware of @entity4 's valuation			2
@entity64 failed with a £ 3million bid for @entity3 during the summer transfer window was there interest in him during the summer transfer window ? @entity64 were very keen on the youngster in the summer and had a £ 3million bid turned down			1
the decision to reject the offer looks a very good decision now			0
@entity3 ' valuation has sky - rocketed , with @entity4 likely to get at least double the £ 3m offered by @entity64			1
so is it just @entity1 who are interested ? no. he 's been watched by every single @entity13 club - but @entity1 seem the most serious in their interest			1
@entity64 remain interested , but know they are fighting a losing battle with the @entity5 certain to move for @entity83 next month			0
@entity84 have also watched @entity3 of late			2
his dad , @entity85 , is actually a scout for the @entity86 .			0

@entity3 has been watched by every @entity13 club
but @entity1 are ready to launch a bid for the @entity4 defender in january
@entity3 was signed from non-league @entity59 for just £ 10,000
@entity64 made a £ 3million bid for the 21 - year - old last summer
