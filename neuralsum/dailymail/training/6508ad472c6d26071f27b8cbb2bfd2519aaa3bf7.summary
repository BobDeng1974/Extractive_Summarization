by @entity0 last updated at 10:03 am on 5th january 2012 a young woman faces an uncertain future with her loving fiance - as there is a 50/50 chance he will end up as her carer			1
@entity7 is just 26 but has already seen her father , aunt and grandmother succumb to @entity12 's disease			1
she is afraid that she too will fall victim to the neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects muscle coordination and leads to cognitive decline and dementia			1
@entity19 ignorance ? @entity7 and fiance @entity20 who may become her carer later in life the condition typically shows symptoms in middle age , but @entity7 's grandmother was just 35 when she first fell ill. every patient is affected differently but the most common symptoms are jerky , uncontrollable movements , dementia , depression , lack of coordination and general decline which more often than not results in an early death from pneumonia , heart disease or physical injury			1
@entity12 's patients in the later stages of the disease need round the clock care and there is no cure			2
a simple test could tell whether @entity7 is a carrier of the gene before she embarks on married life and the task of building a family with her fiance and childhood sweetheart @entity20 , 32			1
but recruitment consultant @entity7 has chosen to leave her future to fate for now rather than face the possibility that she too will end up needing constant care like her father , @entity57			1
she said : ' i know @entity20 would take care of me if i ever fell ill but i do n't want to spend the rest of our lives dwelling on what could happen			2
' i 've always said to him , " whatever happens , do n't put me in a home			2
" i think that is my biggest fear			2
' i find sometimes the only way to get through it is to stay positive			2
i do have my down days - maybe once every couple of months - but @entity20 reminds me that there is always someone else out there worse off than you			2
' collect photo of @entity7 and her father @entity73 , who suffers from @entity12 's disease @entity7 was only young when her grandmother @entity75 died of the disease			1
initially her family suspected she was going senile as she was frequently falling over , bumping into things and at one point set herself on fire			1
over time it became apparent that something was seriously wrong and eventually @entity75 was diagnosed with @entity12 's disease			2
@entity7 's aunt @entity83 was one of the first people in the @entity85 to be tested for the dominant gene which causes the condition			1
@entity7 said : ' we did n't see a lot of her as kids and it 's really only been in the last four years that we have regularly been around her			1
she 's really quite bad now			0
she ca n't stay still , she 's constantly moving and twitching			0
' she has got progressively worse , but you can still hold a conversation with her , while my dad has gone the complete opposite way			0
' @entity73 decided to get tested for @entity12 's when @entity7 was in her late teens			1
seeing her grow up and knowing that soon she would want to start a family of her own meant he needed answers about her future			1
if he was not a carrier of the faulty gene , then she would neither be			0
if he was , there was a 50/50 chance @entity7 could go on to develop @entity12 's and pass the gene onto her own offspring			1
the results of the genetic test sank him into a devastating depression			2
not only would he have to face the horror of @entity12 's , but so might his daughter			0
@entity7 said : ' at first my parents kept it quiet for about eight months or so			1
i think they were trying to come to terms with it and let it sink in			0
' in the end , my mother blurted it out during an argument - the usual stuff about me being a bratty teenager , like you do			0
i had been out at the cinema and she said to me , ' you are so selfish , you do n't even realise that your dad is ill. ' ' it was n't the best way to find out but afterwards she sat me down and explained everything			0
she had all the books and information and told me to come to her with any questions if i had them			0
but at that point i think i just wanted to stick my head in the sand and ignore it			0
' @entity57 was diagnosed ten years ago at the age of 40 and started showing symptoms soon afterwards			0
first he developed an uncontrollable twitch in his finger , then another in his shoulder			0
after a while , his physical symptoms were overtaken by mental ones			0
@entity57 's personality has since deteriorated before his family 's eyes			2
he is no longer capable of showing his wife @entity152 , 46 , love or affection , his selfishness dictates everything and his routine can not be disturbed at any cost			0
@entity7 bought him a watch with the date on it so she would not have to tell him what day of the week it was several times a day			1
she said : ' he still asks , i just tell him to look at the watch now			0
i do n't want to take that little bit of independence away from him by just telling him			0
' it was n't until @entity7 formed a relationship gas engineer @entity20 , a local boy who she had known since she was 14 , that she began to think more seriously about what the future might hold for them			1
the pair got together eight years ago and have been engaged for two following a romantic proposal in a @entity173 hotel			0
since then , they have been renovating their home in @entity176 , @entity177 , and thinking about starting a family			2
@entity7 said : ' the time for me to have the test is now really , but i would rather leave things up to fate			1
i think the reason @entity20 and i did n't get married straightaway is because having a family is more important to us than a piece of paper			2
' @entity20 has a thirteen - year - old son , @entity190 , from a previous relationship and i love him like my own , but i would love nothing more than to be able to have a baby with @entity20			0
' we are not officially trying , we are just waiting to see what happens			0
but we 've been doing that for a while and there 's still no change so maybe that 's someone 's way of telling me that i need to go have a test first			0
' if @entity7 were to have the test , and it were to be positive , there are some @entity207 options available to them that would ensure her children were not carriers of the gene			1
however , for now , @entity7 and @entity20 would rather not know			1
having seen the devastating effect @entity12 's has had on her grandmother , aunt and now her father , @entity7 is not sure she is ready to deal with seeing her genetic lot written out in black and white			1
she said : ' at least i know @entity20 would do the same for me , even if i became a totally different person because of this horrible disease			0
' @entity7 has earned a golden bond to run in the @entity219 for the @entity220 next april			1
to donate , visit @entity221			0
