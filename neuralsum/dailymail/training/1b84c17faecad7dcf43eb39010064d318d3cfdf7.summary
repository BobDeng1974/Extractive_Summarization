two young women have claimed a ghost photobombed a selfie they took during a night out			1
friends @entity3 and @entity5 took the photograph while they enjoyed an evening in @entity7 on sunday			1
miss @entity3 , 23 , and @entity8 , 22 , had been having a drink at the @entity11 pub on the @entity12 and said the bar was virtually empty when they took the picture			1
horrified by the figure which seemed to be peering between the best friends , @entity36 - who works as a nurse - deleted the spine tingling photo from her phone			0
friends : miss @entity5 , 22 , and @entity42 , 23 , have known each other for the past six years she said : ‘ we took the picture in the bar as we usually would , we are both fans of a selfie			1
' i uploaded the picture to @entity50 and thought nothing more of it			1
but later that night @entity3 rang me in a panic and told me to have a closer look			1
she said there was a figure in the background , and i am quite sceptical about things like that so i just laughed at the time			0
‘ but when i looked back at the picture i could not believe what i was seeing			2
i could n't look at the picture at the beginning as i was too freaked out			2
it is so clear , and it looks like what can only be described as a @entity33 woman , laughing behind us			1
’ the women , who have known each other for the past six years , are regulars at the bar - but said they would think twice before going back again			2
local authority worker @entity42 said : ‘ the bar was dead when we went in			0
it was only when i got home later on that i noticed the photo			2
' i could n't believe it			0
i was absolutely terrified and @entity5 was so scared that she deleted the photo off her phone			1
a lot of people have said we must have photoshopped the picture			0
' i ca n't blame them , but neither of us would even know how to do that			0
i did n't believe in ghosts at all before , but i 'm not so sure any more			0
’ a member of staff at the bar said no - one who worked there had ever seen a ghost .			0
