the @entity0 has passed an extension of federal spending authority that will last until midnight on wednesday , staving off the threat of a government shutdown that could have been triggered by early sunday			2
the controversial move , approved by voice vote on saturday , will give leaders three days to agree on a $ 1.1 trillion spending bill to fund all government agencies except the @entity10 until september 2015			1
senators were called to the rare weekend session after @entity14 @entity13 blocked the sweeping motion			1
extension : the @entity0 approved an extension until wednesday night for the $ 1.1 trillion spending bill the move - defying his party 's leadership - was an apparent bid to sabotage president @entity24 's immigration plans as a band of conservative @entity26 called to immediately defund the program			1
senate majority leader @entity28 ( @entity29 ) slammed opponents of the bill , telling the @entity32 on friday : ' i would hope cooler heads prevail and we can move forward and get this done			0
' there were fears even the extension could be scuppered as negotiations between @entity41 and @entity26 to speed the process along collapsed during late - night talks in the nearly abandoned @entity44			0
some senators , angered over the bill 's easing of a ' @entity49 ' bank regulation law requirement , wanted a shot at removing the provision			1
the 1,603 - page spending bill , negotiated by @entity26 and @entity41 appropriators and leaders , narrowly passed the @entity32 on thursday following a battle that exposed fraying unity in @entity24 's @entity41			1
a revolt over financial provisions by @entity60 @entity59 , long a staunch @entity24 ally , led to a day of tension on @entity62 on thursday			0
talks broke down : senate majority leader @entity28 called for ' cooler heads to prevail ' in the @entity32 democrats , aware of the need for unity when republicans take full control of @entity70 next year after their midterm election gains , tried to tamp down speculation of a lasting split between @entity24 and @entity59			2
one leadership aide said @entity59 had fired a warning shot to @entity26 that @entity32 @entity41 would fight hard in the new year			0
in the 219 - 206 @entity32 vote , 67 @entity26 rejected the spending bill , largely because it failed to take action to stop @entity24 's immigration order			1
but that was offset by 57 democrats who voted in favor			0
the spending bill would fund all government agencies through september 2015 , except for the @entity85 , which would get an extension only until february 27			2
