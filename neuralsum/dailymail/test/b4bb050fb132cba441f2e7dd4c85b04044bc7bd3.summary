police are now urging witnesses of a middle - aged woman 's offensive public transport tirade at a @entity5 woman to come forward after @entity6 published video of the incident			1
@entity9 , 23 , stood up for the @entity5 woman and her partner after witnessing the ranter ' bullying ' the @entity15 commuter on an @entity17 train around 1:40pm on wednesday afternoon			1
ms @entity9 switched on the video camera on her mobile phone to record the vile rant before rushing to @entity5 couple 's defence with a fiery spray notably absent any swearing			1
a police spokeswoman contacted @entity6 on thursday to say they would ' definitely encourage ' witnesses of the incident to come forward			1
in her recording of the incident , ms @entity9 is heard fuming : ' she wears it ( her hijab ) for herself , ok ! ' ' she wears it because she wants to be modest with her body , not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her			2
' ms @entity9 said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded ' all @entity5 @entity39 supporters ' and insulted the woman 's husband and headscarf			1
' that is not her doing it			0
that is a minority of people			0
not a majority of people ok ? ' it does n't matter what they 're doing ... have some respect , have some respect , ' she said , as the woman continued on her tirade			0
' it does n't matter			0
what 's that got to do with this poor lady ? what 's that got to do with her ? ' ' she was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before i spoke up then as soon i started defending them she stopped ' the @entity5 couple told @entity9 ( left , right ) that they were ' very grateful ' for her stand ' nothing , ' the ranter replied			1
' exactly ! ' ms @entity9 fired back			2
' you 're the one who started the argument ! ' the woman said			0
ms @entity9 then instructed the woman to be silent			1
' no , you 're the one sitting there saying things under your breath , shut your mouth , simple			2
' you shut your mouth , ' the woman replied			2
' no , you shut your mouth			2
you 've got nothing nice to say , do n't say anything , simple			0
' ms @entity9 recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone , ending with the passenger telling her to ' breathe '			1
she told @entity6 the @entity5 couple and the angry woman alighted the train at @entity121			1
ms @entity9 told @entity6 the couple alighted the train at @entity121 ' i missed my stop because i wanted to stay on and make sure they were ok , ' said ms @entity9 , who was on her way home to @entity129 ' i missed my stop because i wanted to stay on and make sure they were ok , ' said ms @entity9 , who was on her way home to @entity129 ' i missed my stop because i wanted to stay on and make sure they were ok , ' said ms @entity9 , who was on her way home to @entity129			1
ms @entity9 said the woman was saying ' horrible and hurtful things '			1
' she told me if i was in their country i would have been stoned to death because i was wearing a dress			0
' she was saying a lot of things i just got to the point where i had heard enough			0
' the @entity5 couple were ' very grateful ' for her stand , she said			0
police and @entity143 have not yet received any reports of the incident			0
the @entity146 issued a statement praising ms @entity9 's actions shortly after @entity6 's report			1
' we are heartened by @entity9 's actions - she is a reflection of ' @entity154 ' and we hope that her actions inspire others to stand up against racial or religious vilification , ' it said			2
the group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video			0
' the sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like @entity168 [ @entity169 ] are extrapolated to all 1.5 + billion @entity5 '			2
the group 's founder , @entity170 , told @entity6 incidents of abuse against @entity5 women were becoming increasingly common			1
'' i 'm very conscious of ensuring that i have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure i will be able to record incidents should i either be the victim in an incident ( or a witness ) , ' she said			1
a hijab - wearing woman told the @entity183 last month she was subject to a physical and verbal assault on a @entity15 train , with a man allegedly shoulder - charging her and hitting her with his bag and leg			2
@entity170 ( pictured ) , a lawyer and public advocate for the rights of @entity5 , says incidents such as these are increasingly common ' i 'm very conscious of ensuring that i have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure i will be able to record incidents should i either be the victim in an incident ( or a witness ) ' @entity170 has been the target of racist attacks herself ' it was a fully crowded train but nobody said anything			1
i know they were scared , ' @entity202 said			0
as for ms @entity9 , she told @entity6 she was already overwhelmed by positive comments she had received online , having posted the video just yesterday			1
' good on you for sticking up for whats right more people should be doing the same , ' wrote punter @entity208			0
' well i do n't know you but thank you , thank you for understanding , ' said @entity211			0
overwhelming response : ms @entity9 has been bombarded with positive comments since the video appeared online ' i hope some day when you need help and are boxed in a corner someone as bright as you is there to support you just like you did for those poor souls			1
' we really need to look for the best in people and understand that its a few rotten apples who try to spoil the lot			0
' all the best wishes for you			0
