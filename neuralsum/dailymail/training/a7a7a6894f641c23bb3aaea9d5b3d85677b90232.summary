@entity52 mp @entity51 said this move alone required parliamentary approval			0
he said : ‘ we are tiptoeing towards having a policy			0

‘ i want @entity2 to come back and i want us to hold the government to account			2
why are we not arming the @entity48 ? why are we only providing humanitarian aid ? ’ mr @entity0 faced criticism yesterday as he and his wife @entity68 began a week - long break in @entity70 , less than a week after returning from a vacation in @entity72			1
