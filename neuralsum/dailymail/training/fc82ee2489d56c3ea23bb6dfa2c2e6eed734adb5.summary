by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 09:03 est , 6 november 2013 daredevils risked a frosty ending - using their ice - cool nerves to scale these icy climbs where just one mistake could cause the ice to shatter and collapse			2
the breathtaking routes , found in the @entity8 , were tackled by @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 who braved treacherous conditions to explore the spectacular structures			1
each climb takes between four and six hours with the trio having to maintain intense concentration to avoid the dangers in front of them			1
hang on ! each climb takes between four and six hours with the trio having to maintain intense concentration to avoid the dangers in front of them @entity10 and @entity11 braved the cliff faces to pick their way up the sheer cliff faces the climbers are vulnerable to falling ice , slashing their ropes with their own climbing axes and spikes a small lapse could leave them vulnerable to falling ice , slashing their ropes with their own climbing axes and spikes , changes in weather and even avalanches			1
from the other - worldly forest of stalagmites and stalactites on @entity42 to the dagger - like formation of @entity44 - each route offers something unique to take on			0
@entity9 , from @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , said : ' the views are magical and lovely - but the route is tough			1
@entity10 can be seen inching himself up a cliff face as he works his way through the @entity8 from stalagmites and stalactites on @entity42 to the dagger - like formation of @entity44 - each route offers something unique to take on freezing weather , melting ice and blowing snow are just a few of the problems that are faced each day ' on @entity42 you have all your weight on your arms for long periods of time so the clock is ticking			1
you need to keep moving to keep holding on			0
' adventure photographer @entity66 , who captured the trip in february this year , added : ' there is a difference of opinion as to which is harder - climbing ice or climbing rock			2
' but i think ice is much more unstable - ice climbs form differently each year			0
ice climbing provides a harsher climate not to mention the fact it melts and can break			0
' there 's no question photographing ice climbing can he hard on you and your gear			0
' freezing weather , melting ice and blowing snow are just a few of the problems that are faced each day as well as long hours hanging around in a harness or sitting on the side of a mountain waiting for the right shot			2
' but the contrast of colours and locations make it all worthwhile - it really is one of my most favourite subjects to photograph			0
