@entity12 asked the regulator of the @entity3 to probe whether there was really enough evidence to charge mr @entity2 and other well - known figures who have been on trial recently			1
@entity20 stars @entity21 and @entity22 were both cleared of sexual assault charges after long - running trials , leading to accusations that the @entity3 is over-zealous in prosecuting famous people			1
mr @entity2 , the mp for @entity27 , today vowed to use his position to fight for others caught up in the legal system and then acquitted			1
he has asked mr @entity12 , chairman of the @entity31 , to consider whether defendants should be given more protection before and during trials			1
the select committee boss has written to @entity35 , the @entity3 's chief inspector , urging him to examine whether the prosecutor 's procedures are ' sufficiently robust '			0
mr @entity12 asked mr @entity35 asked him to look into whether the @entity3 had followed due process in deciding whether to bring prosecutions , whether there was sufficient evidence to bring charges , and whether the procedures in such cases needed to be amended			1
' politicians should not become involved in the operational decision - making of the @entity3			2
it is vital , however , that the processes followed by the @entity3 are correct and robust , ' mr @entity12 said			1
' @entity2 has asked that the committee look at this issue and i have written to mr @entity35 to request he investigate whether we need to make changes to the system			1
we await his response with interest			0
' the balance must be struck so that the public remains fully confident that those who are guilty will be brought to justice , but also that those who are innocent are not unnecessarily punished			0
' earlier today , mr @entity2 suggested that the @entity3 had become over-zealous in pursuing sex abuse claims after failing to charge @entity63 with paedophilia			1
' the balance probably went too far in one way and now it seems to have gone too far the other way - that there is almost this we - better - charge - just - in - case - and it does seem to be unfair , ' he said			2
last thursday , a jury at @entity83 unanimously cleared him of all the charges			0
he told @entity85 's programme this morning that ' there were weak allegations which were bundled together to make it look as if it were a stronger case '			1
the mp continued : ' i 've likened it to being hit by an @entity94 truck as soon as you wake up , and several times during the day			0
the only worse thing i could have been accused of was murder			0
' the people who are throwing the mud remain anonymous , yet i was put into the full glare of world publicity from day one , as soon as the police knocked on the door			2
this is something that needs to be looked at			0
' he denied claims that there is a culture of low - level sexual abuse within @entity111 , saying : ' there is a narrative that has been put out there , and people are spreading this narrative , but it 's completely wrong			1
' claims : in the wake of the case , allegations have emerged of a culture of sexual abuse in @entity111 mr @entity2 revealed that he would not seek to regain his position as deputy speaker , which he resigned last year after being charged with assault , and said he would focus on fighting for reforms to allow acquitted defendants to reclaim their legal costs			1
' i 've got a voice , and there are a lot of people who 've equally gone through the mill and do n't have the voice that i have , ' he told today			0
' people who are wrongly accused and been put through the mill , they need proper representation			0
' but at the end of it all , when they 're acquitted they 're told , " you 're not going to get a single penny back			0
" that has got to be wrong			0
' he told @entity148 's @entity147 that in light of his experiences , he opposes the cuts to legal aid made by the @entity153			0
' i see things through the prism of having gone through sheer hell for 11 months , ' mr @entity2 said			2
' i believe people who are dragged through the courts , who are acquitted , should get a reasonable legal cost back			2
' acquitted : @entity20 stars @entity21 and @entity22 were also cleared of assault charges the mp suggested that the @entity3 had become over-zealous in pursuing sex abuse claims after failing to charge @entity63 with paedophilia			1
' the balance probably went too far in one way and now it seems to have gone too far the other way - that there is almost this we - better - charge - just - in - case - and it does seem to be unfair , ' he said			0
mr @entity2 said he had received more than 1,000 messages of support and he was ' heartened ' by prime minister @entity176 's remarks after the verdict , in which he hinted that the mp will be brought back into the @entity179 fold			2
deputy prime minister @entity180 defended the work of the @entity3 , telling a @entity183 press conference it was a ' linchpin ' of the legal system			2
he said : ' i 'm sure the @entity3 as a matter of course will always review cases , particularly where they have n't succeeded to deliver prosecutions they felt were merited			0
' but i will always defend the @entity3 as part of the checks and balances in our judicial system			0
' we would n't have much of a judicial system if the @entity3 succeeded every time			0
that 's what justice is about - it 's about people bringing prosecutions and then those allegations and those claims being examined in court and a decision being made			1
' a @entity208 spokesman said : ' anyone who has applied for legal aid and is subsequently acquitted of a crime is entitled to be repaid at least part of their legal costs - irrespective of whether their application was accepted			1
