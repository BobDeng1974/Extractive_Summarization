by @entity0 smiling for the cameras as make - up artists dab foundation on their nipples , the models backstage at @entity4 's s / @entity3 menswear show could have stepped straight off the set of 2001 film @entity11			1
others are pictured with curling rags in their hair , while one shows off an impressive six - pack as he snaps a photo while make - up artists work on his legs			2
a third stands passively while concealer is dabbed on beneath his eyes while a fourth meekly submits to having his legs waxed			0
more unusual were the swimsuits , with @entity4 opting to send single - shoulder swimming costumes down the runway alongside more traditional tight , white pants			1
but it was n't all bizarre swimwear and brooding models			0
the latest round of menswear shows kicked off in @entity53 on saturday , with @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 among the big names setting the standard			2
@entity54 offered a return to 90s minimalism , with nude form - fitting vests deconstructed and turned into t - shirts with the help of loose , mesh sleeves			0
one man , lots of make - up : a model almost disappears beneath a scrum of make - up artists and hair stylists ouch ! a model looks ( understandably ) nervous as he has his legs waxed ahead of show time in @entity53 it 's beautiful ! a model does his best to look smoulderingly sexy - despite having his hair in curling rags bags begone : a model has @entity83 's @entity82 applied to his eye bags backstage at @entity87 get them off ! a model gestures towards his pinned up curls as he chats to a @entity4 make - up artist true to form , creative director @entity93 kept things neutral , using the same easy - to - wear nude on everything from shorts to shirts			1
while @entity93 's work was wearable , @entity99 's @entity98 chose political instead , using her new menswear collection to rail against cruelty to pigs			0
in a far cry from @entity4 's buffed and bronzed models , many on the @entity106 sported pig 's noses , while t - shirts came emblazoned with a pig logo			0
despite the politics , much of what was on offer was sporty perfection , with beautifully cut joggers and some excellent tailoring among the highlights			0
tomorrow will see pieces by @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 take to the runway on the final day of @entity87 before the action moves to @entity126 , starting on the 25th			1
surf 's up ! @entity4 showed an unusual one - shoulder swimsuit and a @entity131 inspired pair of swimming shorts taking a bow : creative director @entity4 found time to go backstage for a photo with models tight : the skintight t - shirt made a return to the catwalk , as did summer black for the second year in a row			1

the models were seen backstage at @entity32 during @entity87
