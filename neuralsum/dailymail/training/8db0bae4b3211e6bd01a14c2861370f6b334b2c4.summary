by @entity0 published : 13:18 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 13:22 est , 8 october 2013 chief trunk bags , a luxury luggage purveyor that was considered the @entity4 @entity3 of the early 20th century has now been relaunched with a new generation in mind			1
following a 50 - year hiatus from public consciousness , the label is now poised to restore its famous ' chief ' canvas stripe to the glory it once held during the ' golden age of travel			2
' the brand has been painstakingly reconfigured by new owners who have translated its formal , pre-aviation - friendly trunks into a range of tote and weekend bags for the modern traveler			1
the chief : @entity24 and @entity25 have relaunched the @entity26 as chief trunk bags , with duffle bags ( above ) , weekenders , and totes for @entity4 travelers in its heyday , @entity32 was actually known as @entity35 , named for its origin hometown of @entity37 , @entity38 , an early 20th century hub for creative manufacturing			1
the brand was revered for its trunks : wheel-less luggage , that while now considered clunky and unrealistic , were once a necessary component of luxury travel in its early days			1
their distinctive red and yellow ' chief ' stripe , first introduced in 1898 , served in lieu of a monogram			2
the label honed its prestige at a time when international travel was just finding its footing among society ’s elite , whose extended trips on luxury ocean liners required large , and equally lofty luggage			1
new owners @entity24 and @entity25 , @entity65 businessmen with deep roots in the fashion industry and affection for elevated travel , see the label as a prime example of the era 's travel fever			0
‘ the brand grew up during the golden age of travel when people were traveling around the world , and what [ brand ] your trunk was said something about you , ’ @entity24 told @entity73 by phone			1
‘ it ’s kind of the same idea as what your bag says about you now			0
’ @entity25 added that in its peak , @entity37 embodied the early , ‘ romantic concept of traveling the world			0
’ the original : the @entity26 made its name with classic luggage baring its signature ' chief ' stripe it was considered @entity99 ’s own answer to @entity3 , with trunks selling for up to $ 600 ( or approximately $ 10,000 today , with inflation )			1
the brand maintained independent boutiques in @entity65 , @entity104 , and @entity105			1
‘ among the @entity4 population @entity37 likely had a better reputation than @entity3 , as there was not as much globalization then , ’ @entity24 said			0
that influence peaked in the early 1930s , and the brand closed soon thereafter in the early 1960s			2
while traveling for work as @entity113 ’s @entity99 director of business and planning , @entity24 discovered bits of @entity37 remnants in a vintage luggage stall at @entity104 ’s famous flea market , @entity119			1
but his run - in with the @entity37 relics was somewhat of a nostalgic blast from the past			0
‘ my parents had two of the old suitcases and i sort of grew up with the brand around as a kid , ’ he told us of his history with the label			2
‘ i was in @entity104 and suddenly saw this striped trunk and thought “ wait a minute , i know what this is			1
” his reintroduction to the label soon turned into ‘ a person quest ’ to restart @entity37			0
‘ there was such a rich history of design , i was like , “ wait , why has n’t anyone dealt with this ? ” ’ he said			0
for everyday : @entity24 and @entity25 have also created classic carry - all ( @entity142 ) and zip - up ( r ) tote bags for their shoppers ' everyday needs			2
the label ’s intellectual property rights had expired , rendering its ' chief ' stripe , among other signatures , as public domain			2
@entity24 ventured to @entity37 ‘ to see if there was a viable business , ’ and re-trademarked all of the brand ’s associated signatures , as well as its name			2
he decided that @entity37 was the perfect opportunity to link up with @entity25 , who he had already worked together on multiple fashion and luxury goods projects in the past			1
but rather than reestablish @entity37 as a luggage brand built for trips on chartered yachts and steam locomotives , @entity24 and @entity25 ‘ reinvented the brand as it would exist today , revolving around the @entity4 good life , ’ the latter partner said			1
‘ ’ it ’s not a jet set life , but it ’s something we all aspire to — the idea of journeys and jaunts , more weekend destinations that revolve around social circles of friends			0
’ positioning : the original @entity37 luggage was ' inconspicuous in circles where essential niceties are taken for granted and only shortcomings are remarked , ' reads an advertisement dating back to the early 20th century they renamed the label ‘ chief @entity186 ’ to avoid confusion with children 's retailer @entity189 , which is considered @entity37 , @entity38 ’s best - known surviving export			1
the label ’s nucleus , its distinctive red and yellow ‘ chief ’ stripe , took nearly a year to redevelop			0
‘ we basically pulled it apart thread by thread to match the weight and color , it was a whole process , ’ @entity25 said			0
taking direct inspiration from the ‘ chief ’ , the duo has created a range of carry - all ’s , totes , weekenders and duffle bags fit for seersucker - wielding , @entity212 graduates on a quick weekend journey to @entity215 ’s foxtail - strewn coastline			1
the bags -- manufactured in the @entity217 of mostly @entity4 - made materials -- range in price from $ 65 for a change purse to $ 1,095 for a leather - trimmed weekender			0
at present , they are exclusively retailed through @entity32 's own e-commerce site			0
comparative work : at the height of its popularity , @entity225 had an @entity4 cachet comparable to that of @entity3 luggage in @entity232 but what sets the chief designs apart from other weekenders is their decidedly tailored feel			1
unlike many canvas rucksacks on the market , the designs feel like they would fit in better at an inn on @entity243 ’s @entity242 than at a quaint motel near the @entity217 population ’s favorite artsy upstate weekend destination , the @entity247 : @entity249 galleries			0
‘ we did n’t want something too hipster or too young for it to have some heart to it , ’ @entity25 elaborated			0
‘ we definitely did want to be different and bring back the glamour			0
’ @entity24 summed it up , adding : ‘ we want to be a modern brand that has great heritage rather than just a heritage brand			0
