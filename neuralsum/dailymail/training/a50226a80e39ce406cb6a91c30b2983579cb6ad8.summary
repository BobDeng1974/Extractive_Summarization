there had also been brief references made by @entity7 , played by @entity33 , about feelings for someone in her past - with no indication that the person was @entity25			1
but the kiss came after @entity7 arranged the romantic picnic and confessed her undying love for her close friend			1
she said : ' there was a moment , must have been 15 years ago , i should have said it then and i did n't			0
i 'm in love with you @entity8			1
' when @entity25 replied that the revelation was too late , @entity7 takes matters into own hands and leaned in for the kiss			1
as is par for the course with this series of @entity1 , it was just a matter of minutes before viewers were sharing their disbelief on @entity58			2
the pair had become firm friends throughout the series after @entity25 convinced @entity7 to take on the show 's central case , regarding @entity30 @entity8 ( left ) was left stunned after @entity33 ( right ) confessed she had been in love with her friend for 15 years when @entity25 says it is too late , @entity7 takes matters into own hands and leans in for the kiss one person tweeted : ' biggest shock of my life this week on @entity1 i thought @entity8 and @entity7 were sisters ' , while another added : ' i thought them women were related ? !

massive plot twist for me ! ' , while another viewer said : ' that lesbian kiss			2

the second series of the @entity113 cult show has already divided opinions between viewers , with many criticising legal inaccuracies during the trial			2
last week , viewers were shocked to see a ' @entity120 ' scene in which @entity121 is seen ' strangling ' his wife @entity123			2
the pair 's encounter took place outside in the ruins of a barn on the cliff tops where @entity121 is living			1
fans also complained that they were finding it harder to understand @entity132 - because his accent has become ' more @entity134 '			0
even those who were better - informed about the characters ' relationship were still left baffled - including @entity109 - unsure why the relationship was only explored in the penultimate episode of the series the actor , who plays dour detective inspector @entity141 , received wide - spread praise for his performance in the first series of the acclaimed show			1
but a number of viewers have complained that they are finding it increasingly difficult to understand his accent ever since the second series got underway			0
viewers also accused scriptwriters of adding in an unrealistic scene in last week 's episode - table service from @entity153 's			1
elsewhere , mother @entity154 , played by @entity155 , prompted ridicule when she returned to court to witness the trial of @entity30 a short time after an easy water birth			0
viewers accused @entity1 of going ' @entity161 ' following this charged scene between @entity121 and @entity123 on last week 's show meanwhile , a scene showing @entity132 being given table service at @entity166 's also sparked outrage viewers also criticised the fact that @entity154 ( pictured ) had returned to court to witness @entity30 's trial just after giving birth last night 's viewing figure was at 5.8million , a huge slump from the initial 7.3million who tuned in for the first episode of the second series			1
the criticism has led to @entity132 to jump to the show 's defence , saying the second series of the show is a victim of its own success			0
he said : ' i think we 're a victim of our success to be honest			0
the first series was such an extraordinary thing			0
this country , we never allow lightning to strike twice in this country ... we just do n't let that happen			0
' so , inevitably there was going to be a certain amount of " it 's not as good as the first time "			0
' i think it is			0
i think it 's a wonderful series that i 'm very proud to be part of			0
