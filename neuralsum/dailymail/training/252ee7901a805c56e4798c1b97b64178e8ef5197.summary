it is a rare - and brutal - example of nature at work			0
a powerful golden eagle swoops on an unsuspecting @entity5 deer , digs in its claws in and tries to drag its prey away			1
these images , captured by zoologists in a nature reserve the remote @entity12 region of southeast @entity13 , show a particularly audacious attack which sees the eagle fell an animal several times its own size			1
swoop : this golden eagle soars in and sinks its claws into a @entity5 deer dig in : the powerful bird starts to lift the panicked animal from the ground lift - off : the eagle spreads its wings before lifting the deer from the ground although the golden eagle is notorious for its bold hunts , and have been caught attacking coyote and even a young bear , experts believe this is the first documented attack on a deer			1
the three frame show just two seconds of action , and were taken accidentally by scientists researching the endangered @entity37 tiger in 2011			1
the pictures , and a description of the event , were published in this month 's @entity41			0
@entity42 , of the @entity43 , found the shots during a routine equipment check			1
after discovering the astonishing photograph , ms @entity42 and her colleagues found a carcass which they believed to be that of the unfortunate deer just yards away			0
she said : ' it 's the first time i 've seen anything like it			1
it 's rare for golden eagles to snatch up deer			0
' i saw the deer carcass first as i approached the trap on a routine check to switch out memory cards and change batteries , but something felt wrong about it			0
' there were no large carnivore tracks in the snow , and it looked like the deer had been running and then just stopped and died			0
impact : in this shot the eagle makes contact with the deer drag : the bird can then be seen digging its claws in and starting to drag its prey away endgame : the eagle then drags the deer out of shot to make its meal ' it was only after we got back to camp that i checked the images from the camera and pieced everything together			1
i could n't believe what i was seeing			0
i 've been assessing deer causes of death in @entity13 for 18 years , this is the first time i 've seen anything like this			1
' dr @entity97 , from the @entity98 - which works with the @entity99 - said : ' the scientific literature is full of references to golden eagle attacks on different animals from around the world , from things as small as rabbits			2
' their regular prey - to coyote and deer , and even one record in 2004 of an eagle taking a brown bear cub			2
' ' in this case i think @entity42 just got really lucky and was able to document a very rare , opportunistic predation event			0
' golden eagles are one of the most widespread @entity117 in the world , and live in areas of @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			0
they are renowned hunters , capable of killing prey much larger than themselves with their deadly talons			2
the birds weigh 12lbs , have an 8ft wingspan and can fly at speeds in excess of 100mph			0
sika deer can grow to weigh more than 300lbs , but the victim of the pictured attack was not fully - grown			2
messy end : the remains of the deer were found two weeks after the attack , near where the shots had been taken			1

vicious bird of prey attacks unsuspecting prey from behind
then drags the terrified beast away to be eaten
amazing shots were captured by scientists in @entity12 , @entity13
zoologists believe it is the first time such an attack has been photographed
