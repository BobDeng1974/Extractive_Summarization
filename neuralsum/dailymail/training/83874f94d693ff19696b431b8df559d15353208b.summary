there will come a time when @entity2 will seriously start thinking about the man to succeed @entity4			1
that moment just has n’t arrived yet			0
make no mistake the club ’s chief executive @entity7 was as worried as the 60,000 @entity2 fans who had to swallow another defeat against @entity11 at the @entity12 last saturday			2
@entity7 , unlike a cerebral caller to @entity14 pleading with @entity4 to walk away on monday evening , has been playing a straight bat in public			2
@entity17 ( left ) , who has been touted to replace @entity4 , shook hands with the @entity19 @entity20 gave @entity2 an early lead which they never looked like relinquishing @entity22 doubled the lead to give the @entity23 breathing space against last season 's runners - up this , then , was the chance for @entity4 to hit the critics for six after successive defeats in the @entity31 against @entity32 and @entity11			1
a goal , scored by @entity20 just 74 seconds after the start of this @entity36 clash with @entity37 , completely altered the atmosphere at the @entity12			0
let ’s not pretend otherwise because a vast number of @entity2 supporters , and others outside of this parish , have been braying for @entity17 to replace @entity4			1
taking @entity37 ’s players for a training session on a muddy surface at @entity47 is part of his unorthodox methods			0
@entity4 , as we are all too aware , knows only one way			2
in the sanctuary of the dressing room , there are a growing number of players who want @entity4 to change his ways and adapt to the demands of the modern game			1
they want a different approach , better coaching at the back and more advice on technique and tactics			0
they are not getting enough of it			0
when he was leading the team to three @entity31 titles he appeared to be ahead of the game			1
now he has fallen behind it			0
@entity4 poses with the @entity31 trophy in 2004 , the last time he won the title with @entity2 @entity4 has taken @entity2 to the last 16 of the @entity78 for 15 consecutive seasons unquestionably the aura has diminished and it will take more than a victory in the @entity83 final against @entity84 last season for the aura to return			1
he is not a quitter and never has been after a career that has taken him to north @entity89 via @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			0
despite the flirtations with @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 over the years — all designed to strengthen his hand at @entity2 — @entity4 has never once properly considered breaking a contract with this club			1
in recent weeks there has been an appetite for change among the fans and even the most loyal — the ‘ @entity107 ’ , or @entity109 brigade — have been on the turn of late			0
@entity4 , though , is unmoved			2
in his programme notes he spoke of the solidarity in the squad and made a point of referencing @entity17 ’s poor run with @entity37			2
for all the love showered on the quirky @entity117 coach , @entity37 are in the relegation zone in @entity119			0
last year they competed in the @entity78 final , only beaten at @entity121 by the brilliance of @entity123 when he scored @entity96 ’s 89th minute winner			2
@entity123 pounces to give @entity96 their fifth @entity78 , breaking @entity37 's hearts at @entity121 @entity17 has the glare of many camera lenses on him as @entity37 relinquish their 100 per cent record in @entity36 then , they were upwardly mobile , a team to be feared after beating @entity94 — once in the group stage and again in the semi-final — on the way to @entity121			1
in a few weeks ’ time , at @entity135 in @entity136 , the balls will be drawn out of the pots for the @entity78 second round ties			0
between now and then @entity2 have a run of fixtures in the @entity31 — against @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 — which could see them start creeping their way back towards the top four			1
this @entity78 win , sealed by a moment of class from their one genuine great @entity22 , meant an awful lot to @entity4 judging by his reaction to a special goal			1
he was pumping his fists on the edge of the technical area , waiting to salute the forward as he made his way back to the halfway line			0
@entity4 paid £ 30million for @entity22 and he certainly knows how to finish a job			1
@entity162 pleased with fast start			0

this was the chance for @entity4 to hit the critics for six after successive defeats in the @entity31
a vast number of @entity2 supporters and others outside of this parish have been braying for @entity17 to replace @entity4
when he was leading the team to three @entity31 titles he appeared to be ahead of the game . now he has fallen behind it
