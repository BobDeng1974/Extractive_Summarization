president @entity0 has abandoned a proposal to scale back the tax benefits of college savings plans amid a backlash from both @entity5 and @entity6			1
@entity0 announced the changes to popular accounts , known as 529s for the area of the tax code that allows them , last week as part of his @entity15 address			1
it was part of a plan to consolidate and simplify a sometimes confusing array of tax breaks for college students into two simple measures that would result in a net tax reduction of $ 50 billion over 10 years			2
resistance from @entity24 was swift , with even @entity6 deriding the ' middle - class economics ' proposal as anti-middle class			1
in this jan. 20 , 2015 photo , president @entity0 delivers his @entity15 address to a joint session of @entity24 on @entity30 in @entity31			1
the @entity32 is already dropping a proposal @entity0 made in the speech to to scale back the tax benefits of college savings plans amid a backlash from both @entity5 and @entity6 in @entity24 aides said @entity39 @entity38 pushed senior administration officials to drop it as she flew with the president aboard @entity43 from @entity44 to @entity45			1
other democrats also privately weighed in against the plan , including rep. @entity48 of @entity49 , the top @entity50 on the @entity51 , and @entity53 sen. @entity52 , the no. 2 @entity50 in the @entity54			1
' the president 's plan has the puzzle pieces necessary to bring the middle class back , but this particular piece did n't fit , ' @entity52 said in a statement			2
the @entity32 said wednesday @entity0 yanked the proposition from his budget because it had become a ' distraction			1
' @entity0 's plan would have levied taxes on future contributions to the 529 college savings plans			1
current accounts would have been grandfathered , so existing funds could still grow and be withdrawn , tax - free			1
contributions to college savings plans are not tax - deductible at the federal level			2
but once the money is invested , it can grow and eventually be withdrawn with no tax on the earnings , as long as the money is spent on tuition , fees , books and supplies needed to attend post-secondary school			1
the savings plans , which are sponsored by states , can also be used to prepay college tuition			0
about 12 million families take advantage of college savings plans			0
about half were held by families making more than $ 150,000 , according to a 2012 report by the @entity93			0
about 30 percent of plans were held by families who make less than $ 100,000 , the report said			0
roughly 10 percent of 529 accounts are maintained by families with incomes of $ 50,000 or less , the @entity97 told the @entity101			0
the @entity0 administration said all the additional revenue it obtained by taxing withdraws from 529s would have been used to help expand and make permanent a $ 2,500 tax credit that families can use for education expenses			1
under current law , the tax credit is scheduled to expire at the end of 2017			0
the @entity32 said wednesday @entity0 's proposal to scale back the tax benefits for savings plans was just component of his overall plan to cut taxes for the middle class and to make college more affordable and tried to downplay the significance of the president 's about - face			1
the part affecting 529s would have only amounted to $ 1 billion in revenue over 10 years and was ' a small , tiny piece of a program we wanted to implement on behalf of middle class families , ' @entity32 deputy press secretary @entity121 told reporters			1
@entity0 is also putting forth a ' bold ' $ 60 billion plan to make the first two years of community or technical college free			2
' he did n't want this to be a stumbling block that would jeopardize the rest of the package , ' @entity133 said			0
asked if the @entity32 still stood by the 529 roll back as good policy @entity133 said : ' sure			2
' president @entity0 and the first lady just returned from a trip to @entity44 and @entity45			0
they are pictured here at the 66th @entity145 celebrations and the @entity146 on @entity147 in @entity44			0
as they were on the flight back to the @entity150 the @entity32 was scaling back changes to the tax code the president had planned to introduce in his budget next week house speaker @entity155 commended the president on tuesday evening for backing away from the proposal			1
' i ’m glad president @entity0 has decided to listen to the @entity150 people and withdraw his tax hike on college savings , ' he said			2
earlier in the day , at a @entity30 news conference , @entity155 had called on @entity0 to remove his plan from his budget request , due to @entity24 next week			1
@entity166 sen. @entity165 , a @entity5 , also celebrated the @entity32 's retreat , as did the top @entity5 in the @entity54 , majority leader @entity168			2
' this is welcome news for the countless hardworking parents who make sacrifices to save and provide for their children 's futures , ' @entity169 said in a statement			0
for @entity179 , the disagreement with @entity0 over the usefulness of 529 accounts was personal			2
' i fought to ensure these plans were tax - free at the federal level , ' he said			0
' thanks to this incentive to save , millions of @entity150 use 529s to help prepare for college expenses			0
' these are good plans that promote responsible savings			0
i ’m not sure why president @entity0 would have sought to undermine them in the first place			0
it ’s just good to see the president coming around to @entity5 ’ pro-middle class view in the end , ' @entity179 said in a statement			0
@entity0 is no longer asking @entity24 to make changes to the college saving plans but the request will still appear in his budget next week the @entity32 said on wednesday			1
' the announcement yesterday was made after the book was in the shop to be produced , ' @entity133 confessed .			0
