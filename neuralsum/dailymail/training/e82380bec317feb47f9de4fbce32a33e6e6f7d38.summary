spurs are on their way to @entity4			0
they have an @entity6 at the controls and @entity8 can be forgiven if his knees are still trembling when he gets there			0
@entity11 were coasting serenely towards a march 1 date with @entity13 , with a two - goal aggregate lead and only 13 minutes to go against their opponents from @entity17			1
enter @entity18 , a teenage @entity19 supporter who was signed from @entity20 and who delivered two goals in 140 seconds which turned everything upside down and brought @entity24 to life again			1

enter @entity29 ( again ) with his second of the night , a clinical finish arrowed inside the post after @entity95 had split an open defence with a pass			1
@entity29 ’s first had been a delicious free - kick , curled into the top corner , in the first - half , but it was the second which clinched it			1
this was the fourth time this season the @entity128 has scored in the 87th minute of a match and it meant there was no way back for @entity28			1
spurs celebrated as the snow started to settle on the pitch , before they returned south where they can prepare for a rematch of the 2008 final , when they beat @entity13 to win this competition			0
it was the last major trophy they delivered to @entity142 and this feels a significant step for the club			1
it is hard to avoid the feeling that @entity11 lost direction somewhere between the departure of @entity150 and @entity8 ’s arrival but they seem to be building with purpose			2
they scored five past @entity13 in the @entity153 , earlier this month , and here in in the form of an appearance in the @entity54 final is something tangible for supporters to latch onto			2
@entity83 was proud of his team , even if the nature of defeat had made it harder to swallow			0
“ to come this close makes it worse in a way , ” said the @entity28 boss , who will turn his attention back to the quest for promotion against leaders @entity169 on saturday , before an @entity171 replay against @entity172 , next week			2
“ we ’re a club on the up , ” added @entity176 , as he lamented @entity72 ’s miss , early in the game , which might have given the night a different complexion had it not been cleared by @entity42 on the @entity11 goal line			1
goalkeeper @entity183 spilled a high cross from the right under pressure from @entity71			0
@entity84 thought he had been fouled , but referee @entity108 played on and the ball dropped to @entity72 , who had time but was unable to find a way past @entity42			0
this apart , @entity11 controlled the first - half			2
@entity95 moved with menace , slamming one shot into the hands of goalkeeper @entity62 and another into the outside of the post as he sidled past his markers			0
@entity28 captain @entity67 was deployed as the deepest midfielder but was finding it difficult to contain the fluent movement of @entity200 and @entity29 when he conceded a free - kick on the @entity11 right , 25 yards from goal			1
@entity28 had an excellent chance to go 1 - 0 up early on through @entity72 but it was saved on the line @entity18 scores @entity28 's first goal to get the @entity17 club back into the @entity54 semi-final second leg @entity18 scores @entity28 's first goal to set up a nervy ending for the @entity153 club @entity18 scores his and @entity28 's second goal to give the @entity17 club the lead on the night and make it 2 - 2 on aggregate it looked like @entity18 had set up extra time for the @entity17 club but @entity11 won it in the end through @entity29 @entity18 slides in celebration as he gets @entity28 back in the tie on wednesday night at @entity24 @entity11 let their two - goal lead on aggregate slip as @entity28 scored twice through @entity18 in the 77th and 79th minute click here to read the match report from the first leg of this tie at @entity142 @entity229 stepped @entity29 and swerved the ball with his right boot across keeper @entity62 and into the opposite top corner of the net			1
“ no goalkeeper in the world would have kept that out , ” said @entity83			0
the execution was stunning - @entity62 did not get close – and it was a reminder of the quality chasm between the teams and the goal pierced the mood			2
@entity62 used his legs to save again from @entity95 and the home crowd seemed apprehensive , fearing perhaps this might turn quickly into a heavy defeat			0
like their supporters , the belief of @entity28 ’s players seemed to be draining away			2
they went forward with a little less intent and defended nervously			0
@entity73 lashed one wide from 20 yards , but @entity83 needed to get them back in the dressing room , regroup and inject some of the spirit which saw them knock - out @entity253 and @entity254 on the way to the last four			0
@entity28 were tasked with keeping @entity11 's in - form striker @entity95 quiet at @entity24 kane battles for the ball with @entity63 of @entity28 during the @entity54 semi-final second leg on wednesday night whatever was said , it seemed to work			1
@entity28 returned with far greater threat			2
they managed to lift their supporters , but were kept at distance by @entity11 , who still remained dangerous as they operated more selectively , on the counter-attack			2
up front , the tireless @entity95 fired another shot wide having been slid clear by a pass from @entity93 and then muscled his way through on goal only to be thwarted by @entity62 , who saved again from the young striker as he took over free - kick duties from @entity29			1
@entity89 also went close but they could not find the goal to help them relax			0
@entity83 sent on 18 - year - old @entity18 and @entity274 for the last 16 minutes			1
the double change represented his final throw of the dice and it produced an incredible reaction			0
@entity18 quickly converted coolly at the far post from low cross from right - back @entity63 , @entity11 wobbled and , minutes later , he struck again			1
again , it came from a cross from the right and this time the shot from @entity18 hit @entity85 and deflected past @entity84			0
the home sensed something to match @entity288 ’s comeback win at @entity13 , but @entity29 had other ideas , helped by @entity95			0
spurs are on their way to @entity4			0
@entity28 manager @entity83 ( centre ) was hoping to orchestrate a cup upset over @entity11 on wednesday night the two goals from @entity18 were not enough to warrant @entity28 a chance in extra time as @entity29 stole the show the referee for the @entity54 semi-final second leg , @entity108 , pinches his nose on a cold and damp night at @entity24 @entity11 chairman @entity302 ( right ) in the stands during the @entity54 tie as his club try to make the final against @entity13			1

@entity11 arrived looking to avoid an upset after winning the first leg 1 - 0 at @entity142
@entity29 gave @entity11 another 1 - 0 lead at @entity24 with a sublime free - kick after 28 minutes
@entity28 equalised through @entity18 in the 77th minute to set up a nervy ending
@entity18 then scored again less than two minutes later to make it 2 - 1 on the night and 2 - 2 on aggregate
@entity29 saved the @entity153 club in the 88th minute with the winning goal to make it 3 - 2 on aggregate
