by @entity0 published : 17:33 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 17:51 est , 2 march 2013 identical twins @entity1 and @entity3 shared an extraordinary intuition			1
throughout their schooldays , their interests and talents were as indistinguishable as their looks			1
so when , tragically , @entity3 was left trapped in a vegetative state after a horrific car accident when the boys were just 16 , @entity1 knew that as his twin , he was the right person to speak on his brother ’s behalf			1
and in 2009 , three years after the crash , it was @entity1 who made the heart - wrenching decision to end his brother ’s life			1
after the accident in 2006 @entity22 initially still had some brain activity and would respond to simple commands @entity1 ( left ) and @entity22 ( right ) shared an intuition which @entity1 felt keenly when @entity22 was in a coma with the full support of his mother @entity30 and older sister @entity31 , @entity1 went to the @entity32 seeking permission to withdraw @entity3 ’s nutrition and hydration			1
two years later , after tests were completed , the court agreed and on december 7 , 2010 , @entity3 died peacefully in a hospice			1
it is only now that @entity1 , 23 , feels able to talk about what happened and his role in the decision			1
‘ every time i saw @entity22 , it was like looking at a mirror image of myself , ’ he says			2
‘ it was like watching myself die			2
but if it had been me lying there , i ’d have wanted him to do the same			2
‘ i feel very empty without him			2
as though i have lost a part of myself			2
but the extraordinary thing is the moment he died , without realising it , i seem to have taken on his mannerisms			2
' apparently i now walk , cough and laugh just like him			2
i have told mum i shall now have to live for the both of us			2
’ @entity1 and his mother @entity30 ( right ) decided three years later that ending life support was the right thing to do @entity1 ( left ) and his twin @entity22 ( right ) pictured with their mother @entity30 on a family holiday as children @entity1 and @entity3 , from @entity69 in @entity70 , were boarders at @entity72 in the @entity73 at the time of the accident			1
they had spent the weekend with family friends nearby			2
their parents – @entity79 , an accountant , and @entity30 – were divorcing and it was a difficult time			2
@entity82 , 19 , the son of the family friend , offered to drive the twins and another schoolfriend , @entity85 , back to school on the sunday evening of april 30			2
@entity3 and @entity1 piled into the back of @entity82 ’s @entity88			1
@entity85 sat in the front			2
@entity1 put on his seatbelt , @entity3 did not			1
‘ @entity82 drove along the narrow country roads and into the school grounds , ’ @entity1 recalls , ‘ but we went over a hill too quickly and smashed into a 4x4 driven by one of the school ’s groundkeepers			1
identical twins @entity1 ( left ) and @entity22 ( right ) @entity3 at the age of four ‘ i remember spinning around in the car and was then unconscious for a few minutes			1
‘ when i came around , i decided to get help from school and as i wandered down the road , i saw @entity22 lying curled up about 15 yards from the car			1
he was breathing but it was very shallow			2
‘ i was in such a state of shock , i initially could n’t work out why he was there			0
it was only later i heard he had been thrown out of the car			1
‘ he and @entity82 , who tragically died that night , were quickly taken away by ambulance			0
‘ another ambulance took @entity85 – who fortunately was n’t too badly hurt – and me to @entity112			0
' i had some internal bruising			0
@entity22 was taken to @entity115 in @entity116			0
after a week , @entity117 told me that he was n’t in good shape so i went to see him			0
’ @entity1 pauses and looks down at his hands in his lap. ‘ i could n’t stay with him for more than five minutes on that first occasion			1
‘ i do n’t think anyone can understand what it is like seeing your identical twin like that because it looks as if it is you			0
‘ he had two massive black eyes , his head was shaved and there were tubes attached to him everywhere			0
it could so easily have been me , if i had n’t put my seatbelt on , and i felt knocked off my feet for a long time			0
i sat and cried in the hospital waiting room			0
‘ it was also so heartbreaking to realise that something like this could happen in a blink of an eye			0
‘ one minute we were having a laugh on the way back to school and the next ... ‘ i gradually got more used to seeing him and on regular occasions while he was in an induced coma , i would hold his hand and talk to him and the nurses would tell me his blood pressure went down and he seemed more relaxed			1
‘ i stayed at boarding school , but thought about him all the time			0
because of our telepathic connection , when i could n’t sleep or felt very agitated , i knew something was wrong			0
' i would then phone mum to ask about him and it usually turned out that he had had an epileptic fit			0
it was the weirdest experience			0
@entity1 ( left ) and @entity22 ( right ) pictured with their sister @entity31 in 2005 , one year before the accident ' @entity22 still had some brain activity initially and would respond to simple commands , but sometimes when i thought i ’d seen something , the nurses said they had n’t			1
’ shortly afterwards , @entity3 was operated on for a ruptured stomach and from then on tests recorded zero brain activity			1
as well as developing epilepsy , @entity3 had several strokes			1
his immune system shut down and he suffered from meningitis , @entity177 and chest and urinary infections			0
in 2008 , @entity1 , his mother and sister met doctors and they mentioned that withdrawing feeding was an option			1
@entity1 felt positive about the idea			1
‘ it was heart - wrenching to watch @entity22 ’s physical deterioration			0
he had no dignity and could not communicate , which is no way for anybody to live , ’ says @entity1			1
@entity3 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) with their sister @entity31 ‘ @entity117 signed a “ do not resuscitate ” order and we took the decision as a family to withdraw feeding and let nature take its course			1
i had to force myself not to focus on the emotional side , as i did n’t want @entity22 to feel any of that when i went to see him			0
‘ i believed strongly that as @entity22 could n’t make the decision for himself , i had to think for him			0
when you see someone who could do everything become completely helpless , you know it is no way to live			0
’ the court agreed in november 2010 that feeding could be withdrawn but the family then ran into another problem			0
‘ the lady who ran the care home in @entity215 where @entity22 spent three years said she did n’t think it was the right thing to do and would n’t allow it to happen there			1
so we had to find a hospice to move him to			0
‘ at the hospice , he survived for ten days and died early on december 7			0
@entity117 went into his room first and i caught a glimpse of him through the door			0
it made me feel i had been hit by a giant stone			0
‘ but i told myself i had to go in			0
i said a final goodbye and a final “ i love you ” then left in disbelief – because i had lost the most important person in my life			1

@entity1 and @entity3 were in the same car accident
@entity3 wore no seat belt and was left in a coma from age of 16
@entity1 let him go after three years and is only now able to talk of trauma
