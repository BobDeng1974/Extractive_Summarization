@entity0 faces being jailed in the same high security prison as a notorious @entity3 prisoner on trial for torture			1
the athlete is due to discover his fate on tuesday when he is sentenced for the @entity9 shooting of his girlfriend @entity10			1
@entity0 ' legal team called for the paralympian to be spared jail and placed under house arrest over fears for his safety , when they presented their case at the sentencing hearing last week			1
with prison authorities under acute pressure to guarantee the fallen track star ’s safety , a meeting of senior correctional services officials met on friday to draw up plans to keep him safe			2
according to @entity54 news agency @entity53 , a cell has been set aside for @entity0 in a wing of just six cells at @entity36 prison , which is guarded by a special task force and where @entity24 is being held			1
security at the wing is second only to the notorious ‘ @entity63 ’ wing - where the most dangerous inmates are held			2
@entity24 is currently on trial at the @entity31 in @entity32 for alleged kidnapping and torture , but is being held in @entity36 as he is considered a high security risk prisoner			1
@entity36 was the execution site of dozens of black political activists by @entity54 's white - only apartheid government , which ended with the election of @entity72 in 1994			1
it is now the home of apartheid death squad leader @entity75 , known as ' @entity77 ' , and is known for a vicious gang culture			2
the correctional services department on monday denied that it was making arrangements in advance of @entity0 ’ sentencing tomorrow			1
@entity36 was the execution site of dozens of black political activists by @entity54 's white - only apartheid government			1
now it is home to the apartheid death squad leader @entity75 @entity0 , right , pictured in november 2012 with girlfriend @entity10 , who he shot dead in their home in @entity36 while she was locked in the toilet , saying that he mistook her for a possible intruder @entity88 , who prosecuted @entity0 for the murder of 29 year old @entity90 , told judge @entity91 that the idea of the athlete serving his sentence at home under ' correctional supervision ' with an order to carry out community service , was ' shocking inappropriate ' for the severity of the crime he had committed			1
he said the double amputee ’s disability should not be taken into consideration when he is sentenced and called for a minimum of ten years behind bars			2
the trial of @entity24 is one of the most high profile and high security @entity54 has ever seen			1
the fugitive arrived in @entity54 on a fake passport and since then a number of his business rivals and associates have died in mysterious circumstances , including @entity119 super car conversion specialist @entity117 and the owner of a string of strip clubs , ‘ @entity123			2
the special arrangements come after @entity0 's legal team told the court their client faces threats from a ruthless prison gang leader is he is given preferential treatment in jail			1
@entity132 - known as @entity133 - said he would order ' a hit ' on the double - amputee if his fame and wealth bought him an easy time behind bars			2
defence lawyer @entity38 quoted the claims from a newspaper article to argue that the athlete 's life would be at risk if he was jailed for killing his girlfriend @entity10			1
@entity0 talks to his lawyer @entity38 on day four of his sentencing hearing at the @entity31 in @entity36 emotional : the athlete 's sister , @entity148 , wipes tears from her eyes next to her aunt @entity152 while listening to testimony from miss @entity10 's cousin , @entity154 , during the sentencing hearing if he is jailed , it was thought the paralympian could have been sent to @entity160 prison in @entity36 , where feared gangs are notorious for turning new inmates into sex slaves in exchange for protection			1
mr @entity38 said @entity132 , the head of the feared 26s gang who claims to control all of @entity54 's inland jail , made his threats in an interview from a prison phone box			0
@entity132 said : ' if he thinks he is going to come here and buy his way to get computers and cellphones and a lavish lifestyle , he must know that will never happen for as long as i am around			0
' the criminal kingpin , who has been in and out of prison for the past 33 years , admitted he had organised similar retribution on other prisoners who had received special care , including the killer of @entity185 - a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle			0
the revelations came after miss @entity10 's cousin made a dramatic appeal for @entity0 to be sent to prison , telling the court that he ' needs to pay for what he 's done ' to her family and his own			1
prison life in @entity54 is characterised by an elaborate system of gangs , through which much prisoner - on - prisoner violence is mediated , a report by a human rights group has found			0
while gang activity is common to many prison systems , @entity54 prison gangs are distinctive			0
most importantly , they have a national organisation			0
as such , a gang member who is transferred from one prison to another , or even released and re-imprisoned , will keep his membership and gang rank in the new prison			0
stark conditions : prisoners are lined up inside the @entity213 during a surprise raid by prison officials checking for drugs and other contraband			0
the jail is the most likely one that @entity0 will be sent to if he is given a prison term for killing his girlfriend @entity10 the gangs have a history that predates the formation of the @entity54 prisons department			1
they are not spontaneous creations in each prison , with an improvised system of membership and command			0
they instead have an elaborate structure , ranking and disciplinary code that mimics the militaristic structures of the @entity54 apartheid system in general and the prison administration in particular			0
the three predominant gangs operating in @entity54 's prisons today are the 28s , 27s and 26s , known collectively as the ' number gangs '			0
the ' number gangs ' trace their origins , by an elaborate oral history , to the late 19th century , when gangs were formed in the all - male compounds occupied by migrant laborers working in the mines on the @entity251 , near @entity32			2
@entity252 : the athlete 's lawyer has argued that there will be a risk from prison gangs if he is sent to jail a report by @entity260 found that promotion is gained by carrying out acts of violence on non gang members or rivals the 28s are said to be the most feared , operating an organised system of ' wyfies ' - or sexual partners			0
the 26s are known for skill at obtaining contraband items , while the 27s enforce the codes of the other two groups			0
inmates who are not associated with a gang complain of having to ' buy ' back their own bunk from gang members and have other possessions confiscated			0
and any attempts to disrupt the structure of gangs often leads to warfare within the gang and with rivals			0
most worryingly , warders often turn a blind eye to gang activities and in some cases , actively collaborate with them			0

@entity0 is set to be sentenced for the shooting of @entity10 on tuesday
@entity0 could be jailed in @entity36 in a wing with just six cells
@entity3 migrant @entity24 is on trial for alleged kidnapping and torture
