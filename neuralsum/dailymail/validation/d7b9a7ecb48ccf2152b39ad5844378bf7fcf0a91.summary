@entity0 last night backed the decision to let @entity2 play in sunday ’s @entity4 final – but took a swipe at @entity7 ’s willingness to question the disciplinary system while matters were still pending			1
@entity10 will face @entity11 at @entity12 after his red card was quashed – with @entity14 , the man the @entity16 defender tangled with on the @entity18 turf – already cleared to play due to being the beneficiary of mistaken identity by linesman @entity21			1
but while the @entity11 boss welcomed the fact that - with the exception of @entity25 - neither of the two finalists will be hindered by suspensions , he believes @entity7 ’s readiness to question the loophole that got @entity14 off the hook was inappropriate			1
@entity2 was sent off in the first half of the @entity33 draw with @entity11 ‘ if you ask me , i would prefer that all the guys were playing – @entity25 as well even though he picked up two yellows , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ you want all of your best players to be playing in @entity38 - you do n’t want anyone to miss out			1
‘ i can understand the decisions			2
the two of them – @entity14 and @entity2 were in a melee at that point but due to the loophole or rules , whether it ’s right or wrong , that ’s just the way it is			1
‘ i do n’t think the whole thing is right			2
but again , it ’s outwith my control			2
the @entity7 defender went in hard on opposing player @entity14 at @entity18 ‘ from our point of view , we have kept our silence and our focus on sunday			1
‘ we have n’t mentioned anything about wanting anyone suspended or that this guy has done this or that			2
‘ we ’re focused on our own team			2
the last thing i would want is for any of my players to speak out about the opposition and what - not when it ’s been dealt with by the authorities			1
i ’m pleased that they have n’t			2
’ the fall - out from the @entity33 quarter - final at @entity18 has threatened to overshadow the build - up to the first showpiece occasion of the season			1
@entity0 , for one , feels the myriad issues to come out of the spicy 1 - 1 draw on @entity77 last weekend point towards the imminent introduction of video evidence			1
‘ i do n’t think it would be a bad thing in certain instances			2
there ’s got to be a real call for it , ’ he added			2
‘ on sunday , with the time it took them to make a decision , i think it would have been helpful			1
‘ but again , it ’s affordability			2
where do you draw the line in terms of games that are and are n’t on television ? ‘ the game has changed so much with the appeal system and tribunals			1
video evidence … it seems to be going that way			0
’ @entity11 players appeal to the linesman after the clash in the @entity33 @entity11 lost the @entity33 final to @entity106 at the end of @entity0 ’s first season in charge			1
rank outsiders to upset @entity113 ’s treble - seeking side this weekend , the former @entity7 star believes it ’s imperative that his side maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of lifting the @entity4 trophy			1
‘ i think that ’s key to it , ’ he continued			0
‘ it ’s @entity7 again , but you play most teams four times a season anyway and you get to know everybody really well throughout the campaign			1
‘ it should n’t come into play at all what happened last sunday			1
i ’ll make sure that the players understand the importance of discipline			0
we have to be committed , we have to compete , but first and foremost we have got to make sure we keep our cool			0
’ the second of four back - to - back games between the clubs this month spanning the three domestic competitions , @entity0 believes that @entity7 ’s superior depth in squad is another factor in @entity113 ’s favour this sunday			1
the @entity16 defender will be able to play in the @entity144 final after having his red card rescinded ‘ you could argue that ( it ’s easier for them ) as they have the biggest squad in the league , ’ he added			1
‘ but that ’s not changed from the start of the season			0
we just have to make sure everybody is ready			0
in certain games i have moved players around , i have maybe made five or six changes in a game as i need everybody ready			0
not just for one game , but for a full season			0
sometimes it ’s not worked and sometimes it has			0
’ @entity0 had revealed how he has changed his squad ’s routine this week , consciously making it a different experience to the build - up to last season ’s @entity33 final			1
last year , the @entity18 squad were holed up in a plush @entity173 hotel for four nights whereas this week they have spent just one night there – with another overnight stay to come outside @entity176 on saturday			0
‘ we only went for one night this year – cost cutting ! ’ said @entity0 with a smile			0
‘ the media day was our day for the players so we just decided to stay up after training and just settle them down			0
we wanted to make sure they were all relaxed and ready for sunday			2
‘ there are certain things that we need to work on that i feel will help us if we want to win the match			0
’ @entity11 striker @entity25 ( centre left ) was also cleared for kicking @entity189 ( centre right ) in the head asked if , with the benefit of hindsight , he regretted some aspects of last year ’ s preparations for the @entity33 final , @entity0 replied : ‘ no because that ’s what i did at the time			1
‘ i do n’t look at anything like that , what - ifs			2
i ’m a great believer that things happen for a reason			0
i ’m just delighted that , within a year , we find ourselves in another cup final			2
‘ that says a lot about what we have at our club , what we have in the dressing room , the mentality that we ’re trying to instil into them			0
it ’s something that @entity7 have , the belief that they can go and do it			1
‘ the games that we ’ve struggled in this season have been when we have n’t handled the expectation			0
against @entity7 and @entity220 , however , we have held our own			1
we ’ve lost one , we ’ ve won one with both teams			0
in other games , where we have been expected to win , we ’ve fallen by the wayside			0
‘ that ’s something we are building on			0
we ’re getting closer , but we are still way apart on the consistency side of it			0
last year , we won 16 league games			0
this year , we have won 14 already			0
so we ’re getting there			0
