by @entity0 published : 11:56 est , 29 march 2012 updated : 18:32 est , 29 march 2012 court : @entity2 a nuclear scientist has gone on trial for allegedly plotting terror attacks with the @entity7 wing of @entity8			1
magistrates investigating the case said the emails @entity2 exchanged with suspected @entity12 ' crossed the line of simple debate of political or religious ideas to enter the sphere of terrorist violence '			1
however his lawyers told the court that while their client had sent angry emails he never took any steps towards committing an attack			1
they said there is no proof of any terrorist intentions			2
@entity2 is accused of plotting an explosion that would have destroyed ' a city the size of @entity30 ' and has gone on trial in @entity32 today			1
he is also alleged to have compiled a ' hit list ' of vip targets including @entity36 president @entity35 and his former interior minister @entity37			1
the 35 - year - old @entity36 - @entity38 was arrested in a joint @entity40 and @entity36 intelligence sting three years ago while researching the @entity41 at the @entity43 nuclear laboratory near @entity44			1
he denies the accusations and told the court that the investigation had been dishonest and imprecise			2
in one email to suspected @entity12 terror chief @entity49 , @entity2 said he would ' propose possible objectives in @entity51 and particularly in @entity36 '			1
he wrote in march 2009 : ' concerning the matter of objectives , they differ depending on the different results sought after the hits			2
' for example : if it 's about punishing the state because of its military activities in @entity61 countries - @entity62 - then it should be a purely military objective			2
for example : the air base at @entity67 near @entity68 in @entity36			1
this base trains troops and sends them to @entity62			0
' in june 2009 , @entity49 asked @entity2 : ' do n't beat around the bush : are you prepared to work in a unit becoming active in @entity36 ? ' @entity2 replied : ' concerning your proposal , the answer is of course yes but there are a few observations			1
if your proposal relates to a precise strategy - such as working in the heart of the main enemy 's house and emptying its blood of strength - then i should revise the plan that i 've prepared			0
' press : @entity2 's brother @entity87 at court at @entity43 - the @entity89 worked on the @entity90 , a device designed to recreate the conditions of the @entity93			0
in 2001 he worked at @entity94 in @entity95 and by 2005 had moved to the @entity96 in @entity97			0
@entity2 's lawyer now fears his trial for ' criminal association as part of a terrorist enterprise ' could be jeopardised by the seven murders committed by @entity105 terrorist @entity104 this month			0
place of work : @entity2 worked at powerful @entity90 machine in @entity108 @entity109 said : ' there is not the least proof against mr @entity2 of any terrrorist intention			0
' he has since the beginning been painted as the ideal guilty party			0
when the justice system gets going it finds it difficult to admit its mistakes			0
' and with the murders in @entity105 this month committed by a suspected @entity12 terrorist , this is not the ideal time to be holding his trial			0
' @entity2 , who denies the charge , faces ten years in prison if convicted .			0
