the independent investigation into the scandal highlights ‘ significant errors ’ , ‘ weak governance ’ , and a ‘ flawed process ’ in which ‘ bidders were treated inconsistently ’			1
the contract to run the @entity6 mainline franchise for 13 years was originally awarded to @entity18 over @entity19			2
however , a legal challenge by sir @entity4 cited significant flaws in the process forced the government to abandon the decision and re-run the bidding			1
the findings vindicate charges by @entity19 and others revealed in the @entity30 that there was an in - built bias against the @entity19 bid which has been characterised as ‘ @entity34 ’ , or ‘ @entity35 ’			1
transport secretary @entity36 last night accepted the damning findings of widespread ‘ flaws ’ in the way the rival bids by loser @entity19 and winner @entity18 were handled by his department			1
but while conceding they made ‘ uncomfortable reading ’ , he insisted there was nothing in the report to blame ministers - putting the onus firmly on his civil servants			1
however , @entity54 ’s spokesman on transport @entity55 named mr @entity36 , his predecessor @entity57 , defence secretary @entity58 who also headed the @entity9 , and former transport minister @entity59 , as serving cabinet ministers with their ‘ fingerprints ’ on the fiasco			1
she said : ‘ this is n’t just a faulty process , it ’s a faulty government			0
’ @entity67 chief executive @entity66 , who headed the independent investigation into the scandal cites a number of ‘ contributory factors ’ which added to the franchise fiasco – including ‘ lack of clarity ’ , lack of leadership , lack of continuity in senior leadership roles , and officials being in too much of a hurry without sufficient planning or preparation			1
these follow cut backs in the department which have left staff ‘ stretched ’ when also dealing with other major projects			0
the right to continue to run the @entity6 mainline franchise from this winter was originally awarded to @entity18 – until a legal challenge by sir @entity4 forced the government earlier this month to abandon the decision and re-run the bidding after identifying serious flaws in the process			1
the highly critical @entity66 report blames : mr @entity66 said : ' my strong initial view is that a number of factors operating together , caused or at least contributed to the flaws			0
' ' there is a body of evidence that strongly suggests that the @entity2 ’s evaluation of the financial robustness of bids in the @entity111 ( @entity112 ) franchise process was developed late , in a hurry and without proper planning and preparation			2
' organisational changes within the department ‘ resulted in a lack of clarity ’			2
’ @entity121 members of the franchise team were relatively junior and inexperienced in comparison with the bidder representatives they were facing			2
’ labour shadow @entity126 said : ' ministers must not be allowed to shuffle off responsibility - not my words but the words of the prime minister			2
this is n't just a faulty process , it 's a faulty government			0
' ' not one but four members of the prime minister 's @entity138 and it 's about time they took responsibility for it instead of blaming officials			0
' the right to continue to run the @entity6 mainline franchise from this winter was originally awarded to @entity18 - until a legal challenge by sir @entity4 sir @entity4 said @entity148 had accepted that @entity18 ’s successful £ 7billion bid for the 15 - year franchise was ‘ five times riskier ’ than @entity19 ’s by demanding a £ 200million guarantee – compared to just £ 40million demanded of @entity19			1
but if the @entity2 had properly followed its rules , the government should have demanded a £ 600million security , he said			0
the independent investigation into the scandal by @entity67 chief executive @entity66 , pictured , highlights ' significant errors ' mr @entity36 told @entity159 : ’ to be blunt , these initial findings make uncomfortable reading			1
but they they provide a necessary and welcome further step to sorting this out			0
’ he said : ' it is clear that the @entity166 has identified a number of issues which confirm that my decision to cancel the franchise competition was necessary			2
‘ these include the lack of transparency in the bidding process ; the fact that published guidance was not complied with when bids were being processed ; inconsistencies in the treatment of bidders ; and confirmation of technical flaws in the model used to calculate the amount of risk capital bidders were asked to provide to guard against the risk of default			1
’ but he also told @entity159 : ' it ’s an interim report			2
nowhere does it criticise ministers			0
’ a further report , with firm conclusions , is expected by the end of november			0
@entity54 ’s @entity195 urged prime minister @entity196 to make sure his ministers take responsibility for the cancellation of the bidding process for the new franchise , which collapsed several weeks ago shortly before @entity18 signed a contract for the deal			1
mr @entity36 was updating mps on an interim report into the affair , which is set to cost taxpayers at least £ 40 million in refunding costs to the bidding firms , @entity209 and @entity18			0
but miss @entity195 said experts said the full cost of re-working all the affected franchises would be in excess of £ 100million and demanded to know how much			0
she said : ' do you agree ministers must take responsibility for serious or systematic performance failures , flawed policy and poor design ? ' ministers must not be allowed to shuffle off responsibility - not my words but the words of the prime minister			2
this is n't just a faulty process , it 's a faulty government			0
' in august , the @entity2 announced that transport giant @entity18 , rather than sir @entity4 's rail company @entity231 , had won the battle to operate a new 13 - year @entity6 franchise			1
sir @entity4 , whose company had run @entity6 since 1997 , dubbed the bidding process ‘ insane ’ and launched a legal challenge to the decision			1
transport secretary @entity36 , pictured , today accepted in full the interim findings of widespread ' flaws ' in the way the rival bids by loser @entity19 and winner @entity18 were handled by his department former transport secretary @entity57 , who presided over the original @entity18 decision , and her successor , mr @entity36 , both defended the bidding process			1
but it was while preparing to defend the @entity251 court challenge that mistakes in managing the @entity6 bidding process were found			1

in addition to @entity19 and @entity18 , two other companies had bid to run @entity6			2
@entity18 which was stripped of the franchise when the flaws welcomed confirmation that it was ‘ in no way at fault ’ , having acted entirely in accordance with the @entity2 's process throughout but added : ' nevertheless we are extremely disappointed and dissatisfied that , as a result of @entity229 's reversal of its decision , taxpayers and @entity6 passengers will not benefit from the better deal that our strong bid would have delivered			1
’ derogatory emails about sir @entity4 ’s @entity231 were allegedly sent between civil servants			1
the messages were between a dozen staff at the @entity2 , which has been accused of allowing the development of a culture characterised as ‘ @entity34 – anyone but @entity4 ’			2
the government awarded the new £ 7billion franchise to @entity18 , but cancelled it before the planned handover in december after sir @entity4 ’s @entity295 , which offered £ 700million less , made a successful legal challenge on the grounds that the government ‘ got its sums wrong ’			1
an insider revealed : ‘ there is electronic e-mail traffic between the officials			0
in some of them @entity19 is referred to in derogatory terms			0
some people sent these messages , others received them			0

’ three civil servants have been suspended by the @entity335 as a result of the fiasco			1
but one of them , @entity338 , the department 's commercial and technical services director , issued a statement through her lawyers shortly after her suspension saying her role in the @entity6 process had been ‘ inaccurately portrayed mainly due to statements and other comment made by the @entity2 itself ’			0
she added : ‘ i would like to make it clear that i did not have lead responsibility for this project and that neither i nor any member of my team had any responsibility for the economic modelling for this project , or for any @entity2 project			0

report accuses ministers of trying to pass the buck onto their civil servants
' four cabinet ministers have their fingerprints on the " franchise fiasco " '
@entity67 chief executive highlights ' significant errors ' , ' weak governance ' and ' flawed process ' in which ' bidders were treated inconsistently '
