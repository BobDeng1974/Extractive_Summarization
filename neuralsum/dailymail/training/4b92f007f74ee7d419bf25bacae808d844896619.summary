police have issued a warning to drone users to be aware of the law with regards to flying them over famous landmarks			1
with drones having been a popular @entity10 gift , there is set to be an increase in the numbers flown over public events , stadiums and tourist attractions			1
however , the law states that drones must not be flown within 150 metres of any congested area , or within 50 metres of buildings not owned by their operator			1
there are also exclusion areas around airports			1
they are perfectly legal to own but it is very easy to break the laws when you are driving			0
' our concern is that in the @entity44 we will see a lot of these things being flown in @entity47 and there is a potential for people to wander into criminal territory			0
' we also recognise that people will use these devices for criminal purposes and we want to send them a message too			0
' stores reported a 24 per cent increase in sales of drones , which could be purchased for as little as £ 30			1
there have been a rise in the number of drone flights over stadiums and public events last year a drone almost crashed into a passenger jet flying near @entity68 numerous videos have been posted on social networks showing drones flying over @entity47 landmarks such as the @entity73 , the @entity74 and @entity75 , possibly in breach of the law			1
there is also the growing worry that rather than drones being used to capture stunning landscapes , they are now being associated with harassing and spying on people			1
in addition , drones have even found their way onto flight paths in one of the more worrying developments			2
a drone flying near @entity68 almost crashed into a passenger jet in july last year – raising fears that 2014 's must - have @entity10 gift could cause a disaster in the skies over @entity96			1
the remote - controlled device , flown by an unidentified amateur , was spotted by the airliner 's pilot but alarmingly was not detected by air traffic control radars			0
a pilot flying over @entity103 in may last near noticed a drone flying very close to the wing of his aircraft the @entity96 @entity107 , the air safety panel that investigates near misses , gave the incident the highest risk rating of @entity112 , meaning there was a ' serious risk of collision '			2
the @entity116 that can carry up to 180 passengers was flying at an altitude of 700ft on the afternoon of july 22 when the pilot spotted the drone			0
he reported the near miss and an inquiry was launched by the board			0
worryingly , investigators were unable to identify the drone and it disappeared after the sighting			0
and back in may 2014 a 74 - seater aeroplane was travelling over @entity103 when the pilot spotted the remote - controlled quadcopter ' very close ' to the right wing - tip. an investigation launched into the incident recorded the risk of collision as ' high ' the @entity96 @entity107 report into the inciden revealed how the @entity138 twin - engine turboprop airliner was travelling at 1,500ft as it came in to land at @entity139 when the pilot noticed the drone			2
the report revealed how the pilot informed the control tower at @entity139 over the sighting and told the operator how the object was ' too close ' to the plane			2
he told the tower that he thought he had seen a ' remote - control helicopter with a very small engine ' before confirming it was a black and red quadcopter			0
a spokesperson for the @entity151 , said : ' people using drones should apply common sense when thinking about where to fly their devices			1
it is clearly irresponsible to fly any kind of drone close to an airport or in a town centre , for example			1
' users should take a good look around at their environment before each and every flight			0
if any potential exists for conflict with other aircraft , people , vehicles or buildings , then try somewhere else			2
' drones are subject to aviation rules and regulations and anyone breaching those rules can be prosecuted			0

drones are not *permitted* to fly within 150 metres of any congested areas
too close to buildings and airports is also breaking the law
sales of drones over the @entity10 period were up 24 per cent
