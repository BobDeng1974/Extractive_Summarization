glam grand slam : @entity1 appears to have given her past come cosmetic surgery there 's no denying the glamorous blonde @entity4 winner @entity1 is a great advertisement for the chain of @entity8 clinics she intends to set up			1
nicknamed dr @entity9 , the 25 - year - old doctor from @entity10 hopes her new business will leave her customers with smooth foreheads and her with fat profits			1
just days after being named as lord @entity16 ’s latest apprentice on the @entity19 show , she is hard at work establishing a chain of dr @entity1 cosmetic clinics with the £ 250,000 she received from her formidable backer			1
but already she has faced a backlash from those who believe she lacks the expertise and experience needed to perform or oversee the anti-ageing treatments she plans to offer			0
so , it must be interesting for @entity1 ’s detractors to learn her local newspaper , the @entity32 , published a story in february , before @entity34 aired , that wrote in glowing terms of her skills			1
the article reported miss @entity1 had set up a company called @entity39 , a team of ‘ leading skin rejuvenation specialists ’ who worked with clients to ‘ achieve their aesthetic dreams ’			1
apparently , her clinics had been so successful in @entity46 that she was planning to expand into @entity10			1
@entity39 , readers were informed , was ‘ led by a team of dedicated @entity49 doctors ’			1
the company offered ‘ a wide range of aesthetic treatments , including anti- wrinkle injections , facial fillers , lip enhancement and skin peels ’			1
how extraordinary then that the @entity59 ’s attempts to locate @entity39 , its premises , any one of those dedicated @entity49 doctors , a website or even a phone number were this week met with a blank			1
there is no such company registered with @entity66 and no listing for it at the @entity68 , the independent regulator of health and social care services			2
naturally , you expect a cosmetic surgery clinic to be discreet , but surely not invisible ? in an attempt to seek more information about @entity39 , i contacted @entity76 , which represents miss @entity1			1
however , a spokesman would only say : ‘ previous to being on @entity34 , @entity1 had set up a trading name in @entity78 as she always had in mind what she is going to do now with @entity16			1
‘ now she ’s won the show , this brand is not something she will be pursuing			0
going forward , her focus will be solely on developing the dr @entity1 brand			1
this brings us to the latest company , dr @entity1			1
at the outset , @entity16 seemed doubtful about miss @entity1 ’s business proposition			1
he was n’t all that impressed — who would be ? — with her suggested name for the company : @entity109 ( skin spelt backwards )			2
the name dr @entity1 was his idea			1
he was also worried about the ethics of cosmetic surgery			1
but eventually he was won round to the idea and picked miss @entity1 over fellow finalist @entity88 , who baked cupcakes			1
one insider at the @entity19 says that @entity16 was ‘ rather taken ’ with miss @entity1			1
‘ she ’s very much a man ’s woman			0
she ’s tough and ambitious , but softer around men , and was all feminine and charm around @entity16			0
‘ he seemed to be quite impressed with her appearance and would help her when she made mistakes			0
’ and the source says miss @entity1 liked to look her best at all times			1
‘ during filming she was always looking in the mirror and talking about camera angles			0
‘ she was paranoid for some reason about going out in sunlight , as though she was worried she might melt or something			0
’ is this an indication that miss @entity1 has had ‘ work ’ done herself — research , you could say , for the job ahead ? firm favourite : a @entity19 insider said @entity16 was ' rather taken ' with dr @entity1 she says not			2
‘ i can 100 per cent verify i have not had any treatment done , ’ she says			2
‘ i do n’t have wrinkles			0
i ’m only 25 and they ’re not treatments that are aimed at my age group			0
‘ they ’re anti-ageing treatments and at 25 , certainly no — i have not had any			0
and i ’m not looking to have any in the near future			0
’ tv critics have been underwhelmed by this series of @entity34 and have described it as ‘ a load of old botox ’			0
one critic said @entity16 had got it wrong by choosing the ‘ butcher ’ ( dr @entity1 ) over the ‘ baker ’ ( cupcake queen @entity154 )			2
at first glance , it may appear @entity16 himself thinks so , too			0
as well as investing £ 250,000 in the dr @entity160 , it had been assumed he would also become a director , take shares in the company — and a cut of the profits			0
he is , for example , a director of @entity168 , the company set up by a previous @entity170 winner , @entity170 , and owns 100 of @entity168 ’s 200 shares			2
but so far miss @entity1 is the only director of dr @entity172 and owns all the company ’s 100 shares			1
surely @entity16 is not being cautious in case the cynics who can visualise pictures of women in the papers under the headlines ‘ dr @entity1 gave me a trout pout ’ are proved right ? not at all , say lord @entity16 ’s @entity183 he insists the delay is simply procedural and he will soon become a director and own half of the company			1
there is no denying miss @entity1 ’s intelligence and drive			2
before deciding she wanted to go into the cosmetic surgery business , she trained to become a doctor , at considerable expense to the public purse			1
raised in @entity196 , one of three children to her mother @entity199 and father , @entity200 , who works for a communications company , @entity1 was , by all accounts , an extraordinarily bright child			1
she attended @entity204 primary school , and @entity205 , which she left with straight @entity206 and an array of prizes			0
from there , @entity1 moved to @entity210 to study medicine			2
while at university she went out with footballer @entity213 , who was on loan at @entity210 from @entity215 before signing for @entity216			0
the relationship is now over			0
one associate says miss @entity1 , who became known during that time as a minor @entity219 , may have ended it because ‘ he was n’t famous enough as a footballer for her ’			2
but who knows , as mr @entity213 did congratulate her on winning @entity34 , which suggests he holds no grudge			0
miss @entity1 graduated in 2011 with a @entity226 ( @entity226 )			2
after leaving university , @entity1 says she did further training in aesthetic medicine in @entity229			1
the details are vague ; what course she did is not clear			0
careful image : @entity1 's company @entity39 was reportedly so successful in @entity46 she was expanding to @entity10 - but it appears never to have existed during the filming of @entity34 , she worked in @entity234 at @entity235 in @entity236			1
she has tweeted several times about having done the night shift in between filming — testament to her dedication to her profession			0
however , building a cosmetics empire and doing the night shift at @entity234 are not compatible with each another			0
one job had to go — no prizes for guessing which one			0
acquaintances say miss @entity1 aims not just to become a successful businesswoman , but rich and famous , too — a ‘ celebrity ’			2
‘ she ’s already talking about cracking @entity250 , which seems a bit premature , ’ says one			0
miss @entity1 insists she wants to set up dr @entity1 clinics because she is concerned about the lack of regulation in the cosmetic surgery industry and wants to ‘ provide a safe environment for women to undergo these treatments ’			1
‘ i do n’t see it as moving over to the dark side , i see it as medicalising the dark side and casting light onto it , ’ she says			0
‘ @entity257 do n’t need @entity8			0
and i am a very moral person , so i would have no hesitation in saying that to a member of the public who came to me for non-surgical treatment			0
’ it ’s not clear whether miss @entity1 plans to carry out procedures herself or to take a purely managerial role			2
plastic surgeons have warned that she does n’t have the skills to carry out procedures			0
‘ she may have done a few weeks ’ training in aesthetic medicine , but that is simply not enough , ’ says consultant plastic surgeon @entity275 , a former chairman of the @entity276			0
‘ it may not be quite as dangerous as putting a hairdresser in charge of cosmetic surgery , but it is still putting patients at risk			1
’ but miss @entity1 insists her clinics are going to be professional and ethical , operated by trained staff who wo n’t give clients a trout pout , frozen eyebrows or a wonky smile			2
she has a wealth of experience behind her , after all , with that mysterious cosmetics empire of hers — @entity39 .			2

@entity1 reportedly set up aesthetic treatment company @entity39
according to @entity10 paper it was a huge success in @entity46
cosmetic surgery clinic did so well she was ' expanding to @entity10 '
however , no premises , website or contact details of company exists
