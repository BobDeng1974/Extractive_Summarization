by @entity0 published : 03:45 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 07:03 est , 16 may 2012 men have long since visited the pub to check out the local birds - but you 're likely to find a totally different kind of chick in this drinking hole			2
staff at @entity9 , in @entity10 , @entity11 , were stunned when they discovered that a @entity12 had hijacked a cigarette bin in their beer garden			1
the plucky bird clearly was n't put off by the smell and made a makeshift nest out of feathers , twigs and moss			0
hatched : the chicks will be fed by their mother until they are old enough to leave their unconventional nest inside the bin : the mother @entity12 has prepared a nest to house her new family despite the obvious drawbacks of nesting in a foul - smelling and ashy bin it is not altogether surprising			1
as well as the being covered and warm the tiny holes in the face of the bin would keep predators at bay			1
home tweet home : customers have been banned from disposing of their cigarettes in the bin and a soft cushion of cigarette butts might also have provided a comfortable and absorbent base for the nest			1
in the wild @entity12 nest in small crevasses in tree trunks which is not a dissimilar environment			1
cleaner @entity51 , 51 , was surprised to find the stowaway and three eggs when she opened the wall - mounted bin to empty it			1
she promptly put up a notice warning punters not to dispose of their cigarette butts in the tray			1
and last thursday , the eggs hatched , revealing three tiny chicks			2
miss @entity51 , who has worked at the pub for four years , said : “ when i opened it , a bird flew out which made me jump			0
' i then saw these little eggs			2
it ’s quite unusual really			0
' i ’ve been listening and trying to look in and i ’ve seen the mother bird flying in and out to see them			0
' pub landlady @entity71 , 52 , said : ' we thought @entity51 was winding us up at first			2
' we do n’t know what to do for the best			0
we do n’t want to interfere too much with the chicks in case the mother abandons them			0
' a spokesman for the @entity79 says birds will nest wherever there is an opportunity			0
he added : ' this can lead to problems if it causes conflict with building maintenance , but generally it ’s ok and people enjoy the experience of having birds close by			0
' landlords @entity92 and @entity93 with employee @entity94 were startled when they discovered the small bird nesting in their beer garden blue tits find small holes to nest in to keep predators at bay			1

@entity12 thought to have laid eggs in bin because it simulates the small *burrows* and holes they use as nests in *nature*
soft cushion of cigarette butts may also have provided a comfortable base
