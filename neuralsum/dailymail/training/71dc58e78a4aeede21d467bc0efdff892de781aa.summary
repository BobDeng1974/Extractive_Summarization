by @entity0 it 's been 16 years since @entity2 disappeared into the bedroom with her ' rabbit ' vibrator on @entity6			1
now more women in the @entity8 own a vibrator than a washing machine			1
sex toys have been a part of many women 's lives for well over a decade - now it looks like men are about to muscle their way into the market			1
@entity0 says that the male population are really starting to embrace the idea of sex toys especially using them with their partner there 's been a tenfold increase in the sale of male sex toys in the @entity8 in the last decade			1
it 's predicted to be the fastest growing sector of the industry in 2014 , with a market worth Â£ 10 million in the @entity8 alone			2
but we 're not talking blow - up dolls here - in fact , the average man 's motivation to buy a sex toy is far from sleazy or selfish			2
easy access to informative sex education , a long overdue discussion of erection problems and a generation of women eager to explain the intricacies of their baffling sexual systems has finally had the desired effect			2
men have grown up about sex , moved past the all - roads - lead - to - intercourse formula and ( finally ! ) acknowledged the basic design flaw of the male / female sexual response system - that the clitoris is outside the vagina			2
the biggest selling male sex toy is the ' love ring ' - a ring that fits around the base of the penis , holding the blood in the three spongy chambers that fill to make him erect			2
how is this a step in the right direction when it 's still penis - centric ? @entity0 has launched a new range of male sex toys called edge designed to improve male stamina in bed a lot of the love rings have a little vibrator attached to them - and that 's designed to bring her pleasure and attempt to even up the orgasm quota ( currently running at about 4:1 in his favour )			1
' @entity81 ' - textured squidgy sleeves that slide over the penis and are then moved up and down by hand to intensify the sensation - are the second biggest selling sex toy for him			0
but far from being used solo , they 're being used with partners as a exploratory couple 's toy ( 75 per cent of buyers are in a relationship )			0
penis pumps , which create a vacuum to improve blood flow to the penis , ensuring healthy , firm erections , are another big seller			0
men , traditionally dreadful at looking after their health , are realising that unless they want to be part of the current post- 40 @entity105 - popping generation , it pays to keep that part of their anatomy in good working order			0
@entity0 says that men 's interest in sex toys could also help improve sex with their partner there was a reason why women wholeheartedly embraced sex toys , in particular vibrators - we need them			1
the vibrator is the most reliable route to orgasm for women ; only 25 percent of women consistently orgasm during intercourse and about 20 per cent seldom or ever do			2
the humble vibrator is , without a doubt , the single most revolutionary device ever invented in terms of female sexuality			0
without it , a large chunk of women would never experience an orgasm at all , let alone be able to teach their partner how to do it			0
( at least if you 've had one , you have a clue what you 're aiming for			0
) the surge of interest from men in sex toys is also a positive move forward because they 're going for products designed to improve sex with their partner in a quest to keep sex interesting for both			1
today 's man wants to perform well and be well informed about sex , rather than cling onto sex myths that are n't based in reality and are n't serving either gender well			0
as most of you know who read my column regularly , i 've been designing sex products for couples for years			0
i 've always wanted to design a range for men because i 've always felt men miss out when it comes to sex toys - the focus has been on women because vibrators are such big business			1
but i was n't convinced men were quite ready and willing to invite devices that might just do the job better than they could , into the bedroom			0
let 's hope the male sex toy phenomena is equally as influential on our sex lives as the female version			1
my new range edge , is the world 's first mainstream range of sex toys for men and is designed to improve men 's performance in bed			1
