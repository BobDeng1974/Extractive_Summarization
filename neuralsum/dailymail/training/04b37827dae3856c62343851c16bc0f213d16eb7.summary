they were reduced to tears when a somewhat harsh letter arrived from @entity3 notifying them about their inclusion on his naughty list			1
but after being given 13 sleeps to turn their behaviour around or risk a @entity12 morning with no presents , brother and sister @entity8 and @entity9 awoke to find themselves in his good books			1
they were left ecstatic as they dashed out of their bedrooms and found that @entity3 had stuck to his word and rewarded their remarkable turnaround			2
yet they did not realise that the letter was actually part of a ploy devised by their mother @entity33 to try and improve their behaviour in the weeks leading up to @entity12			1
the 32 - year - old filmed the children ’s tearful reaction as they opened the letter in which @entity3 described his disapproval of their naughty behaviour			1
despite feeling guilty about the unusual approach and acknowledging that some people will brand her a ‘ terrible mother ’ , mrs @entity9 said the plan was a resounding success			1
aside from a few minor blips , @entity8 , eight , and @entity9 , four , managed to ‘ work out their differences ’ and even calmed each other down when normally chaotic situations began to unfold			2
the turnaround was obviously noticed by @entity3 , as @entity9 found herself the lucky recipient of an @entity64 doll from @entity66 ’s hit movie @entity67 , the year ’s most sought - after present			1
the siblings were reduced to tears when a somewhat harsh letter arrived from @entity3 notifying them about their inclusion on his naughty list but @entity8 was a picture of happiness this morning as he unwrapped a new @entity76 set left under the family 's tree @entity8 was also left euphoric after opening his @entity76 ‘ @entity80 ’ set , while both children were delighted by the array of gifts in their personalised stockings			1
and @entity3 himself even left his own letter this time in which he congratulated the children for making it on to his ‘ nice list ’ and urged them to continue being kind to each other			1
mrs @entity9 , who works for ski tour operator @entity93 , said that the magical @entity12 morning after a visit from @entity3 was ‘ really well deserved ’ after a fortnight of hard work by her children			1
‘ they ran out of their room this morning and were so happy to see the presents , ’ she said			0
‘ they were n’t overly naughty kids but they did fight a lot and this has really helped to work towards something together			0
‘ they have been getting so much better			0
when they were having their baths on christmas eve @entity8 turned to @entity9 and said ‘ he ’s coming ’ as he knew they had been good			2
’ despite being criticised for penning the fake letter after she posted a video online of @entity8 sobbing as he read it aloud , mrs @entity9 said it was never meant to be cruel			1
mrs @entity9 , who also lives with husband @entity117 and one - year - old son @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity120 , said : ‘ we did n’t want them to be sad or for this to be a negative thing			2
‘ it helps them appreciate the presents they got , rather than just assuming they are going to be there under the tree no matter what			0
’ ‘ so we kept telling them about how good their behaviour had become over the last couple of weeks			0
’ but on the few occasions when the pair began to fight with each other , miss @entity9 pointed to the letter which was kept on the mantelpiece and told the children that @entity3 was watching			1
‘ on some occasions , @entity8 would even turn around to @entity9 and tell her off as he said @entity3 could see everything , ’ mrs @entity9 added			1
the video shows @entity147 as he reads out the message , which says that @entity3 is ‘ certain ’ they will be on his naughty list			1
the squabbling siblings put their differences aside having been warned in the missive from @entity40 that @entity3 is ‘ always watching ’ dear @entity8 and @entity9 , i have been watching you for the last few weeks and i am certain that you will both be on my naughty list			1
you have not been good children			0
i can see you have been fighting with each other and not treating each other well			0
this has made me feel extremely disappointed			0
i am also not impressed with the lack of listening you do @entity9 and the attitude you have at the moment @entity8			1
you have 13 sleeps to change this			2
i will be watching you both very very closely in a hope i can change you to the nice list			0
if you do not start behaving you will not receive the lovely presents i have for you both			0
remember only good children are on the nice list			0
i hope to see you on christmas eve			0
@entity3 ‘ if you do not start behaving you will not receive the lovely presents i have for you both , ’ it warns			2
after reading the letter , a sobbing @entity8 looks at his mother and cries : ‘ what are you looking at us like that for ? it makes me upset			2
’ when she responds by reminding him that he has 13 days to turn things around , the dispirited schoolboy says : ‘ i know , but [ @entity9 ] keeps annoying me			2
’ the husband and wife have also decided to treat the children to a trip to @entity183 in february			0
with no threat from @entity3 over their heads , miss @entity9 hopes they can use the holiday to keep working on the children ’s sometime ill - discipline			1
she believes , however , that her successful fake letter ploy will lead to long - term harmony between the pair			0
she said : ‘ they are a brother and sister who fight quite a lot , which is to be expected , and are n’t overly naughty			0
but in the last couple of weeks they seem to have worked out their differences			0
