by @entity1 reporter published : 08:23 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 11:15 est , 11 april 2013 a handwritten letter by scientist @entity3 announcing his discovery of the dna model to his son has sold at a @entity8 auction for $ 5.3 million making it the world 's most expensive letter			1
in the letter dated 19 march 1953 to his 12 - year - old son @entity14 , the @entity12 scientist describes his discovery of the structure of @entity5 as something ' very beautiful , ' weeks before it was even made public			1
@entity20 's auction house had previously estimated the letter would fetch only $ 1 million to $ 2 million			1
breakthrough : in page one , seen , of @entity12 scientist @entity3 's letter dated 19 march 1953 to his 12 - year - old son , he announces his monumental discovery of the structure of dna step - by - step : the father offers his 12 - year - old son a step - by - step , easy to read guide to each part of his model here seen composed of sugar and phosphorus ' we have built a model for the structure of des - oxy - ribose - nucleic - acid , called dna for short , ' he writes of his breakthrough with @entity43 and @entity44			1
' in other words we think we have found the basic copying mechanism by which life comes from life			1
' it includes a simple sketch of @entity5 's double helix structure , which he writes underneath : ' the model looks much nicer than this			2
' he would go on to win a @entity56 for his work , which revolutionized our understanding of genetics			2
the seven - page letter , written to his son in boarding school , concludes : ' read this carefully so that you will understand it			1
when you come home we will show you the model			0
lots of love , daddy			1
' dr @entity3 , who died in 2004 at age 88 , was awarded the @entity56 along with @entity43 and @entity44			2
price tag : the letter , which shared his discovery weeks before it was announced to the public , was sold for $ 5.3 million at auction on wednesday composition : here , on page four of seven , dr @entity3 explains the various orders of each base that make up the model , abbreviated a , @entity84 , @entity85 and c first to know : dr @entity3 is seen with his son , @entity14 , whom he wrote the letter to in 1953 while his son was away in boarding school topped : the letter by @entity92 , who is seen back in the day working , easily passed the $ 3.4million spent in 2008 on a letter written by @entity95 the items are among a dozen artifacts dr @entity3 's heirs are selling to benefit scientific research			1
half the proceeds from the @entity20 's sale would benefit the @entity103 in @entity104 , where dr @entity3 was a professor , the granddaughter said			2
twenty percent of the proceeds from the @entity107 sale would go to the new @entity108 in @entity109 , a medical research institute due to open in 2015			0
the price was a record for a letter sold at auction , @entity20 's said , eclipsing an @entity95 letter that sold in april 2008 for $ 3.4m including commission			1
other items in the @entity107 sale include dr @entity3 's endorsed @entity56 check in the amount of 85,739,88 @entity121 krona , dated 10 december 962 , and a white lab coat complete with stains and wear			1
dr @entity3 's son , @entity124 , now 72 and living in @entity125 , still fondly recalls his father 's discovery			1
' my father believed that @entity5 contained some sort of code so he got interested in codes and he shared his enthusiasm with me			0
' everything came together in february 1953 when my father and @entity136 were given the go - ahead to try and construct a model of @entity5			2
' my father 's enthusiasm could not be contained			0
the story is told of him sweeping excitedly into a local pub called the @entity144 and announcing to all who would listen that he had found “ the secret of life ”			2
then on march 19 my father wrote to me describing the model and its implications			1
i was 12 at the time and away at @entity151 – the @entity12 boarding school			1
discoverer at work : dr @entity3 in seen in 1993 in @entity154 , standing before a blackboard that explains his work to discover the molecular structure on dna ' when i returned to @entity159 my father very proudly showed me the model			2
' the excitement of the event was beautifully captured for the first time in this perfect letter summarising the discovery in seven simple pages			2
' dr @entity3 , @entity43 and @entity44 all won the @entity56 for physiology and medicine in 1962			2
attempting to put his work in simple terms , dr @entity3 wrote to his son that @entity5 could be thought of as a ' very long chain with flat bits sticking out , called the “ bases ” '			1
he said : ' we have two of these chains winding round each other – each one is a helix – and the chain , made up of sugar and phosphorus , is on the outside and the bases are all on the inside			0
' now the exciting thing is that while there are four different bases we find we can only put certain pairs of them together			0
' nobel prize : @entity192 pose with her father @entity124 as he holds the 1962 @entity194 awarded to his father dr. @entity3 on wednesday in @entity8 medal : the 1962 @entity194 awarded to dr. @entity3 is held up before its auction on wednesday lab coat : @entity199 , director of historical manuscripts at @entity107 , shows a lab coat worn by dr. @entity3 , complete with stains , that was auctioned off @entity5 , or deoxyribonucleic acid , is a giant molecule containing the coded instructions of life			1
two @entity159 scientists , @entity43 and @entity3 , first described its famous double - helix structure in 1953 , changing the face of biology for ever			1
the complete set of @entity5 instructions that makes us what we are is known as the @entity214			0
within it , there are 2.9 billion chemical " letters "			0
certain sequences of these letters make up the genes , the " software " that tells cellular machinery how to make all the proteins in the body			0
working out the entire pattern of @entity5 in the human genome is a technical achievement that has been compared with landing men on the moon			0
a dna molecule consists of two strands that wrap around each other to resemble a twisted ladder			0
the sides of the ladder , made of sugar and phosphate molecules , are connected by rungs of chemicals called nucleotide bases			0
four different bases are present in dna , and it is these that make up the letters in the genetic code			0
they are adenine ( a ) , thymine ( @entity85 ) , cytosine ( c ) and guanine ( @entity84 )			0
the two dna strands are held together by weak bonds between bases attached to each strand , forming base pairs			0
genome size is usually defined as the total number of base pairs			0
in the case of the human genome , the figure is 2.9 billion .			0

letter was expected to fetch only $ 1 million to $ 2 million at auction
