there 's a charming town in southern @entity2 , roughly 600 miles from @entity3 and 400 from @entity4 , where an @entity6 woman is living in a different kind of world to @entity9 and @entity10			1
it ’s here , in @entity12 , where @entity13 calls home these days			1
or at least for the next six months , if things go well			0
she ’s taking a big step in this small town , moving to professional football from the @entity6 amateur game , where she scored the goal that lapped the planet			1
but her dream for years has been to get to this level , playing full - time football in a respected league			2
@entity10 , @entity9 and @entity54 all make the cut as @entity56 selects their top 10 best goals of 2014 only the best players in the @entity2 top flight can expect to earn as much as £ 800 a month , but for @entity37 , ‘ it ’s about loving the game , not being rich ’			1
in that sense , the romance has never been less one - sided			2
there have been almost five million @entity66 hits for her goal , though @entity37 is more interested in the countdown to january 12 , when the @entity70 will be presented in @entity71			1
there , at the @entity74 gala , she will learn if the public voted her goal the world ’s best in 2013 - 14 , ahead of @entity78 ’s @entity10 and @entity9 of @entity79			1
@entity80 is her favourite player and @entity81 happen to be her favourite club			1
‘ i might well ask for a picture or two , ’ she says			2
‘ i probably wo n’t ask for an autograph because i do n’t want to look out of place			2
’ @entity13 is all smiles as she is interviewed by @entity56 in her new home , @entity12 @entity13 says ' it 's about loving the game , not being rich ' as she adapts to the change of scenery in @entity2 @entity13 says she will be the happiest footballer in the world if she wins the goal of the year award for 2013 - 14 that much should not be in doubt — the quality of her goal puts her there on merit			1
but the goal ’s circumstances , with 85 people and one camcorder in attendance , means she stands out to say the least			2
‘ @entity80 and @entity10 scored in the @entity106 , so i guess mine is a little different , ’ @entity13 says			1
‘ i do n’t want to sound cheeky but i think mine was the best of the three			2
' and what a remarkable goal it was			0
the 25 - second clip from october 2013 — the span for entries was october 2013 to september 2014 — is a little fuzzy			1
it was uploaded to @entity66 by the manager of @entity23 , @entity116 , whose side were playing @entity118 in the @entity119			1
there is n’t a supporter to be seen as @entity123 ’s @entity122 crosses from the right to @entity37			1
the @entity125 international controls with her right , uses her left to lob her marker and then spins to volley the dropping ball from the edge of the box			0
from cross to net , the ball does n’t touch the ground			0
@entity10 fires @entity78 into a 1 - 0 lead against @entity139 during the @entity140 the @entity78 forward was one of the standout performers during the @entity106 in @entity143 @entity9 scored with this memorable header during @entity79 's 5 - 1 @entity106 win against @entity145 @entity80 's header pulled @entity79 level and sent his team on their way to a 5 - 1 victory @entity152 described it as the best he has seen , @entity151 called it ‘ incredible ’ and @entity156 said it was the goal of the season			1
@entity37 ’s first thoughts were less grand			1
‘ i ’m a forward so i was just thinking that it was my first of the season , ’ she says			2
‘ then after the game the @entity35 manager called me over to watch it on his laptop			2
‘ i thought , “ ok , that ’s actually quite nice ”			2
it ’s lucky it was caught on tape			0
you do n’t get cameras there every week			0
’ @entity116 put the video on @entity66 and for a time it never spread beyond friends and family			0
then things got a little intense			0
‘ after about a week it was n’t noticed , ’ @entity13 says			1
‘ then it went on a football website in @entity49 , a few people shared it and then i had a tweet one morning from @entity184 on @entity185			0
it said # unbelievabletekkers so i got in front of the tv and 20 minutes later they are showing my goal			0
now it has had millions of views			0
‘ i realised how big it was when people like @entity152 , @entity196 and @entity151 were talking about it			0
@entity198 , the comedian , as well			0
@entity54 scored a sensational goal for @entity200 in the @entity201 earlier this month @entity200 players celebrate @entity54 's stunning strike against @entity204 earlier this month @entity205 makes the perfect connection with the ball on his left foot as @entity209 is caught out @entity209 can only look on as the ball floats over his net and looks set to double @entity81 's lead ' @entity213 went through it on tv and was really positive about my technique			1
‘ i ’ve been asked about the goal by shows in the @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity2 , @entity143 , @entity224			1
honestly , it ’s all gone crazy			0
’ after the incredible surge of popularity , it was announced earlier this month that she was on the shortlist with @entity10 and @entity80 , making her the first female player to ever reach the final three			1
‘ some rubbish gets talked about women ’s football so it ’s been very nice that it might help change opinions , ’ @entity13 says			1
‘ but the whole thing has been so much fun			0
to be up against @entity80 is great			2
my boyfriend and i go to watch @entity23 seven or eight times a year			1
‘ funnily enough , my boyfriend ( @entity239 ) plays in the @entity240 for @entity241 and he was up for goal of the season there			2
he was saying , “ how is your goal up for the @entity247 and mine was n’t ? ” it ’s all been so much fun			2
’ @entity250 chested down a @entity252 clearance before volleying home from 50 - yards @entity254 had no chance of saving @entity250 's strike at the @entity257 in april @entity258 connects with his unique version of a bicycle kick during a friendly against @entity79 certainly it ’s made the adaptation to life in @entity2 easier			1
@entity37 moved over to join @entity40 on a one - year contract in june , before she was shortlisted			1
crowds are between 500 and 1,000 a game and training is five days a week rather than the two days she ’d do at @entity123			0
when @entity56 visits she is twice recognised by strangers on the street			0
but for all her new fame and joy at full - time football , it ’s not a living as @entity80 or @entity10 would know it			1
‘ it ’s hard out here with the language and i do n’t make a lot of money , ’ @entity13 says			1
‘ i am looked after with my apartment and bills but what i earn is what i live off			0
' i ’ll have to make a life for myself at some point but this is about the football			0
‘ i wanted to test myself , to give it a go			0
it is what i wanted so i have no complaints about it being hard			0
none at all — i ’m happy			0
this nomination makes me happier still			0
‘ if i actually win the thing i ’ll be the happiest footballer in the world			0
