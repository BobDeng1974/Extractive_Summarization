the tragic death of @entity1 stunned @entity2 , but the horrific crime has led to the creation of a phone app that could save others in danger			1
@entity8 from @entity9 was as shocked as the rest of the country when the pretty @entity13 woman was violently raped and murdered while walking home from a pub in @entity16 , an inner suburb of @entity18 , in the early hours of september 22 , 2012			1
but instead of forgetting about the terrible incident , @entity8 decided to try and develop a mobile phone app that would help others in trouble in the future			1
@entity1 was brutally raped and murdered two years ago in @entity18 mr @entity8 is a full - time sheet metal worker who works long hours			1
however , despite this he worked regularly in his spare time to make the free app that would allow users to request the help of other people nearby at the touch of a button			1
later he teamed up with his friend @entity34 who helped develop the app further and he became his business partner on the project			2
the new mobile phone app was developed specifically to help others in trouble after a year working on it all their hard work came to fruition when the @entity45 app was finally finished			2
it is now available on @entity47 and @entity48			1
@entity49 and @entity1 on their wedding day : @entity53 's murder shocked @entity2 across the country ' what happened to @entity56 was shocking and it got my mind racing			0
i just thought there has to be something that can be developed that can help			0
that was where the idea originated from , " mr @entity8 said			0
' we spent the first six months developing the app and the next six months testing it and making sure it worked properly			1
i worked on the app in the evenings after i 'd finished my job and on the weekends			2
' a memorial site for murdered @entity13 woman @entity1 on the steps of the @entity77 in @entity18			1
it 's hoped the @entity45 app will help prevent a tragedy like this happening again the app works very simply			2
if someone feels threatened they just open the app and hit the help request button			1
this searches for a a range of up to 25 kilometres in the area			2
the app shows people how many other users are located within this radius , but this can be refined as more people download it			1
' it 'll send out a help request and if the person who receives it accepts the request they 'll be given a map showing where the person is who has requested the help , ' mr @entity8 said			2
when activated @entity45 can contact more that one person in the vicinity and is traceable			0
as well as @entity2 it is also available in @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			0
@entity49 and @entity1 in happier times : @entity53 's death inspired @entity8 to develop the @entity45 app ' the whole idea with the app is to create a community			0
initially give it to someone you trust or are familiar with			0
obviously the more people there are on board , the more people there 'll be to assist in a time of need			0
it 's about making your community safer , " mr @entity8 said			0
hawk help is user intuitive and uses the latest messaging technology for faster contact			0
it is suitable for women , men , children , the elderly and anyone whose work involves them being unaccompanied with others , people dating new people or anyone at risk in general			0

the thinking behind @entity45 is to have an phone app that can help protect the whole community ' we 're not trying to make heroes out of people or put them in any danger , it 's more about having a presence and working together as a community , ' mr @entity8 explained			1
' we do n't want anyone to put themselves in danger , but rather to create a support network			0
