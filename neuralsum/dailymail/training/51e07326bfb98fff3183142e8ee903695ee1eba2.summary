his death could so easily have been marked with a simple service in an almost empty chapel			0
@entity4 , a last link to the @entity7 raid , never married and had no children			1
when he died last month aged 99 he had no close friends and it seemed there would be no one to mourn him except a handful of care home staff			1
but yesterday , after a newspaper appeal led to an internet campaign highlighting the forgotten war veteran ’s case , hundreds of people who never knew him came to pay their respects at his funeral – poignantly held at 11am on @entity24			1
all were determined to honour the service mr @entity4 gave his country with @entity50 as ground crew on the famous may 1943 raids by @entity7			1
beneath a grey sky they queued at the crematorium in @entity66 , @entity29			2
around 100 filled the pews within , another 400 or so for whom there were not enough seats stood outside in the rain			0
after the funeral cortege arrived a two - minute silence was observed , then mr @entity4 ’s coffin , draped in the @entity75 and @entity77 flags , was carried in to the chapel to the strains of @entity80 amid spontaneous applause			1
the reverend @entity82 told mourners : ‘ you have come in numbers surpassing anything that was expected			0
you come not because you knew him , but because each of us are part of each other			0
we have a common humanity			0
’ he also told them : ‘ we marvel at the power of the printed word ’ , referring to the short notice appealing for mourners which the undertakers had placed in the local paper			1
the funeral organisers were contacted by veterans ’ groups and other military supporters keen to acknowledge mr @entity4 and the appeal was quickly picked up by others on social networking sites			1
overcrowding : so many mourners attended the funeral that they could not fit inside the crematorium silence : a trumpeter played the @entity110 to remember the dead at 11am youngsters : two of the younger mourners who turned out to pay their last respects to mr @entity4 sermon : the vicar told those gathered that the funeral was testament to the power of the written word gratitude : @entity122 , a matron at mr @entity4 's care home , spoke at his funeral after the service , which ended with the @entity110 , mr @entity4 ’s nephew @entity125 said of the turnout : ‘ it ’s staggering			1
it shows how great the @entity34 public are			2
he was not a hero , he was just someone who did his duty in @entity51			0
we were expecting a few people , a few local veterans , but it snowballed			2
’ @entity138 @entity137 said : ‘ this was a man with only a couple of very distant relatives going to his last resting place alone			2
the @entity34 people responded like only the @entity34 can			1
’ among the mourners were staff from @entity148 care home in @entity66 , where mr @entity4 spent the last two years of his life before dying on october 25			1
matron @entity122 said : ‘ he would talk about the war sometimes			0
his sort of role has often been forgotten			0
he would remove the corpses of the aircrew from bombers when they returned full of bullet holes			0
then he would try to keep the plane in the air ready for the next mission			0
’ standing still : the funeral began at 11am on @entity24 , when @entity34 stops to remember those who died in war pride : hundreds wanted to express support for the war hero who died last month his final journey : mr @entity4 's coffin is unloaded from its hearse at the crematorium honour : a line of cadets queuing up in the rain during the former @entity77 serviceman 's funeral ceremony @entity4 's funeral was disrupted today when the extremist @entity180 tried to use the event to promote itself			1
amongst the floral tributes was a bunch of flowers with a card reading : ' @entity186 ... @entity187 and the @entity180 '			0
an undertaker removed the flowers from display after @entity180 members began to draw attention to them by photographing them			0
but a party official asked angrily : ' who has taken the flowers ? they are from an mep			0
if it was an mp from another party they would be left alone			0
' however , when they demanded the return of the flowers , they were told : ' this is not a funeral for politicians or politics			2
there is no place for that here today			0
' group captain @entity211 of the @entity212 said : ‘ @entity213 served in perhaps the most famous unit of @entity51			2
it is fitting that he should be given this sort of send - off			2
’ mr @entity4 , a distant relative of @entity219 – who in 1812 became the only @entity34 prime minister to be assassinated – was born in @entity221 , @entity222			1
the only love of his life , @entity225 , is understood to have died of tuberculosis in 1935			2
after the war mr @entity4 emigrated to @entity228 , working as a decorator			1
he returned to @entity34 and lived in hotels until he moved into the care home where he died			1
elsewhere in @entity34 , silence fell at 11am as multiple acts of remembrance were held across the country			1
the last surviving @entity236 widow , @entity238 , was among the guests at the national @entity240 in @entity241			0
the memorial bears the names of more than 16,000 fallen service personnel			0
the event took place within the walls of the @entity240 , which is designed to allow a shaft of sunlight to dissect its walls hitting the bronze wreath sculpture when the two - minute silence takes place			1
services held in the capital included one at the @entity257 attended by the @entity258 , and another in @entity259 , featuring musical performances and readings			2
in @entity264 , the mayor of @entity263 made history by being the first @entity267 official to attend an @entity24 commemoration			1
@entity269 ended the long - running republican boycott of the remembrance event , which was prompted by its links to the @entity34 military			1
standstill : the scene in @entity257 at 11am , with thousands of brokers joining in the two - minute silence solemn : workers at the insurance firm traditionally turn out on the balconies and staircases of the building iconic : the service at @entity257 has become one of the most recognisable events of @entity24 each year service : a choir sings during the @entity24 commemoration at @entity290 's ceremony : one major event was held at the @entity240 in @entity241 message : @entity238 , the last surviving widow of the @entity236 , left a note on a wreath at the service in @entity241 poignant : mrs @entity238 places her wreath on the memorial in memory of her husband @entity300 @entity301 : @entity302 , centre , a second world war veteran from @entity305 , at a ceremony in @entity307 today generations : mr @entity302 looks up at a young boy as paper poppies fall through the air during the ceremony under the @entity312 the archbishop of @entity314 visited the @entity315 and the @entity316 in @entity317 to mark the solemn occasion , where he also met service chaplains and was updated on military operations			1
@entity321 said : ' at this time of year it 's essential that we remember and give thanks for all those who gave their lives for the sake of freedom in the two @entity329 , and also remember those who still risk their lives as servicemen and women in our @entity334			0
' it 's a time to recommit ourselves to the cause of peace and to seek to play our own small part as agents of reconciliation			0
