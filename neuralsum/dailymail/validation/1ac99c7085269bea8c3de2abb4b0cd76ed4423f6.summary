warning graphic content @entity0 's throat was cut by a stray skate during an @entity26 game and required 300 stitches but the traumatic accident led to a spiral of nightmares , insomnia , chronic depression and alcoholism			1
twice he tried to kill himself , with the bullet from one attempt still lodged next to his right eye , and only now feels he can cope with his demons thanks to the love of his fourth wife			2
@entity0 was playing for @entity40 in the @entity26 against @entity41 , when the freak accident left him fighting for his life			1
amid shocking , gory scenes , @entity0 tried and failed to get to his feet , as three pints of blood spilled on to the ice			1
‘ once i realised this could be death , my first thought was “ get off the ice , go through the gate , get off camera ” , ’ @entity0 told @entity48			1
‘ so my mum did n’t have to watch me die			2
’ @entity0 ’s mother , @entity54 , both of whose own parents were @entity57 , always watched her son ’s matches live on tv			1

his heart stopped for 78 minutes but he recovered			2
amazingly @entity0 was back playing within 10 days , resumed his career as a player and then became a coach			1
but three years later , in 1992 , trying to obliterate his demons , he drank a bottle of whisky and took pills that led to his heart stopping			1
his ocd and depression were finally diagnosed			1
‘ it was the first time the chaos in my head was given a label , ’ he says			2
at another low , in 2008 , drunk and sitting in his barn , he put a gun to his chin , pointed upwards and pulled the trigger			2
the bullet richocheted off his molars , took out some teeth and a piece of his tongue , went through his top palate and sinus			0
his wife @entity135 then insisted he undertake the longest and most intense rehab of his life , six months			0
‘ she is an incredible woman , she saved my life , ’ said @entity0 from their home in @entity140 , where he has written a searingly honest auto - biography			1
‘ i thought at first it might be a kinda hockey book			0
but the reaction we ’ve had has touched people			0
it ’s a book about life			0
’ it transcends sport , detailing the brutality of depression			1
‘ it ’s everywhere , not exclusive to any occupation , any economic status , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but there is still a stigma around it in sport , where there is constant expectation upon you			0
i was mentally ill. but i thought i was mentally weak			0
’ @entity0 ’s story is far from all doom and gloom			1

he broke down during the second			0
the hospital could not cope with the ‘ circus ’ and he was discharged on day two			0
astonishingly , he was played as a substitute within 10 days			0
@entity0 's remarkable story is far from all doom and gloom ‘ if i had to go through it again , i think i ’d want to come back as quickly as did first time , ’ he said			1
‘ but i should n’t			0
weakness through the blood loss was an issue			0
today you ’d also have a counsellor explaining the psychological impact of the trauma who ’d be telling you there ’s no need to get back quickly			0
and i would follow their instructions			0
’ instead it was 19 years later in the rehab that followed the gun incident , that @entity0 came to terms with what he now knows was the post-traumatic stress disorder that exacerbated his problems			1
back then , he got on with his job , which included taunts from rival fans , including throat - slashing gestures from @entity250 supporters ‘ reminding me to die ’			2
one particularly powerful part of his book takes you deep inside his mind at that time			0
it might also be the mind of any elite sportsmen , tackling pressure and dark hidden thoughts , obsessed with not failing			0
‘ i knew i was struggling , but i was too stubborn , maybe too afraid , to ask for help , ’ he writes			0
‘ i was trained to cowboy up			0
if you get bucked off the horse , you get back on			0

his book concludes : ‘ i nearly bled out in front of thousands			0
this is about sharing the rest of me , because i know there ’s a reason i ’m still breathing			0
‘ i have ptsd and @entity270 , depression and alcoholism			1
i still have meds to take and wounds to heal			0
