by @entity0 published : 21:09 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 21:16 est , 22 march 2013 a few years ago , i said to my mother : ‘ i want to start knitting again			1
’ ‘ what do you mean , again ? ’ she replied , looking panicky			1
decades may have passed , but both of us remembered the horror of my primary school knitting classes			1
the bad report cards , the black marks for misbehaving , the tearful trudge home with some misshapen disaster , a woolly testament to my shame and ineptitude			1
‘ we ’ll give it to charity , ’ mother would say , folding the unspeakable item in a drawer , never to be seen again			1
oh , how i hated knitting back then , the wool squeaky and tight with flop sweat , the impenetrable instructions , the endless plain and purling			1
great fun : you can knit all sorts of creative things , such as this fried breakfast created in wool by @entity34 in @entity35 all that agony , for what ? a grimy egg cosy at the end of term			1
a pair of mittens that appeared to have been mauled by kittens			1
i did n’t give knitting another thought for the next 30 or so years			1
then something happened to reawaken the woolly beast within			1
i really do n’t know what			2
perhaps it is just that i adore hand - knitted things ; the simple beauty of moss stitch , the triumph of a home - made bobble hat , the love and care that goes into every cosy inch of baby ’s first jumper or a pair of booties or a scarf for a friend			2
in a world of fast and cheap fashion , of disposable clothes and gimcrack home - wares , knitting stands apart as something special : custom made , hand - crafted , rather beautiful and created by not much more than a pair of human hands and a bit of application			2
could i do it myself ? i certainly wanted to try			2
and that ’s when i discovered that knitting had changed			2
for a start , bamboo needles ! holy clickety - clack , who knew that needles had now been invented which made knitting easier and smoother for even the worst bungling amateur ? also , knitting was no longer the sole preserve of the happily retired or the elderly , those dedicated few whipping up lacy sherbet lemon bed jackets or scratchy jumpers that no one wanted to @entity96 to @entity97 , one of the country ’s biggest online retailers of all your knitting needs , the number of @entity90 knitters has risen to more than 6.5 million since the recession hit in 2008			1
of that number , 70 per cent are aged 45 - plus — although there is a growing surge in popularity among younger people			2
adorable : nothing is more calming and fulfilling than knitting presents with a wealth of beautiful patterns for covetable things , amazing yarns and even celebrity followers , knitting has come in from the cold			1
now , to encourage this renaissance , the @entity119 is giving readers a brilliant , free step - by - step beginner ’s guide , starting today with a 32 - page booklet and followed by seven collectable glossy pattern cards			1
the guide includes basic techniques , advice about choosing yarns and gorgeous patterns for super-cute babies ’ bonnets and booties , a chic cardigan , a colourful bobble hat and — for him — a fine - knit sweater and very smart scarf			2
@entity141 actresses such as @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 are all keen knitters , while @entity146 , @entity147 and even @entity148 have all been seen busy with their own knitting projects			1
@entity90 knitty celebrities such as tv presenters @entity151 and @entity153 have also done their bit to popularise the craft			1
@entity157 knitter : @entity151 has been spotted busy with her knitting projects this is all a reflection of a broader cultural shift , too			1
not so long ago , knitting was frowned upon by feminists , who saw it as a symbol of female oppression and subjugation			2
if men were n’t knitting tea cosies and tank - tops , then why the hell were we ? yet over the past 20 years , the notion that to knit is somehow to demean oneself as a feminist crusader has itself become an anachronism			2
also , as more and more people turned towards growing their own vegetables , to bottling preserves and jams and to take pleasure in baking and cooking , knitting also found a new place at the @entity187 not ? for knitting is creative and productive			2
the first time i knitted a hat , an actual wearable hat that someone could put on their head and walk down the street in without getting arrested , was one of the most thrilling moments of my life			2
like many , i am indebted to a new generation of knitting writers who not only produce wonderful , irresistible patterns for knitters of all abilities , but guide you from casting - on to the very last @entity207 , toys , cute accessories , cashmere jumpers you ’d actually want to wear , star - patterned baby blankets ? it is all out there , begging to be knitted up			1
step by step , i learned that knitting is nothing to fear			2
also that natural wool is a beautiful thing — and a very forgiving medium to work in			0
as @entity142 says , there is nothing more satisfying than turning a pile of yarn into a garment or a gift			1
wholesome fun : prince @entity226 as imagined in the hit @entity229 book by @entity230 of course , i could never be in my mother ’s knitting league			1
she is one of that generation of @entity90 women who learned to knit as a matter of course			0
she baulks at nothing ; impenetrable cable jumpers , the terrifying procedure known as ‘ pick up and knit ’ , @entity242 knots , @entity244 stitch , turning a heel ? she can do the lot , without taking her eyes off @entity248			0
years ago , she knitted enough jumpers , hats and scarves to kit out our family			0
we just took it for granted			0
now i can only gasp in admiration at her — and millions of women like her — who possess these remarkable skills			0
two years ago , like thousands of @entity119 readers , @entity262 and i became obsessed with @entity230 ’s hilarious pattern book , @entity264			1
it had detailed instructions on how to knit all the most important guests at the wedding of prince @entity269 and the then @entity270 — right down to the liveried footmen in their breeches and even the then archbishop of @entity274 , @entity275 , complete with wispy mohair beard			0
the £ 9.99 paperback had initially sold just over 800 copies , yet after being featured in the @entity119 , it became a smash , selling more than 50,000 copies in the weeks before the wedding			1
it said something wonderful about the @entity119 ’s knitty readership			0
just give us the opportunity to knit a diddy - sized prince @entity287 in 44 yards of beige double - knit yarn , complete with gold buttons and a gilt embossed hat , and we are there quicker than you can say : ‘ have i made his eyes too slitty ? ’ knitted gift : prince @entity297 is chuffed on a trip to @entity299 with his handmade present since then , i ’ve moved on			0
i ’ve knitted dogs ( there are instructions in the @entity119 ’s step - by - step beginner ’s guide to make a cute dachshund )			0
a pair of striped baby socks			0
i think i mentioned my hat			0
a @entity310 , complete with sack of toys			0
i ’ve gained in confidence			0
i ’ve learned that knitting is oddly relaxing			0
to focus on something small , like getting to the end of a row without making a mistake , is almost like meditating			0
there is a kind of sanctuary about it			0
knitters take refuge in repetition and numbers , and the consoling knowledge that it ’s not a pointless pastime , it is a proper craft that will produce something lovely at the end			1
also it is good to know that learning to knit , or trying to improve one ’s knitting skills , is an easily achievable goal			0
it ’s not like learning @entity242 or taking up the clarinet			0
it ’s easy ! sooner than you know it , you will be crossing the line between hesitant beginner and fluid , expert knitter			0
ahem , no , i have n’t quite got there myself yet			0
in fact , i have n’t quite got around to knitting anything bigger than a beany hat			0
but knit-wise , you just never know what might happen next .			0
