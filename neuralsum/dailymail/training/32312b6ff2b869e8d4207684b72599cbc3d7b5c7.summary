by @entity0 last updated at 8:30 am on 2nd december 2011 tax collectors have spent nearly £ 100million over the past year on training courses – many of which were a waste of time , a damning report reveals today			1
the study , from the official spending watchdog , is fiercely critical of @entity10 for having ‘ no strategy ’ about how to train staff			1
the @entity13 said @entity10 did not even know how much it had spent on such courses in the tax year 2010/11			0
waste : the @entity10 offices in central @entity18			0
they tax office lavished £ 100 of ratepayers ' cash on staff training to make matters worse , the report said just 38 per cent of workers found the training ‘ had improved their performance ’			1
@entity10 employs 68,000 staff , many of whom appear to spend a large amount of their time being trained			1
between april 2010 and april 2011 , the @entity13 discovered they had taken part in an astonishing 730,000 courses			0
an average of £ 1,419 was spent on each employee last year , at a total cost of £ 96.5million			1
the report comes just a few weeks after an internal survey of the same staff revealed that many are desperate to leave their jobs			1
just one in five said they felt proud to work for @entity10			0
the @entity13 report found there were more than 2,000 courses for tax staff , which it said seemed a lot , even for a large and complex organisation			1
ninety sessions had just one participant , and others were described as obsolete			0
one course , which cost nearly £ 10million , was aimed at teaching 15,045 workers about a new penalties regime			1
the @entity13 said however it did not achieve ‘ the expected increase in penalties collected ’			0
the training had to be supplemented at a further cost of £ 1.9million			1
@entity65 , head of the @entity13 , said : ‘ at the level of the business as a whole , @entity10 has no strategy to manage the £ 96million it spends each year on skills			1
’ @entity72 of the @entity73 ’ @entity71 said : ‘ of course , it is important that staff are up to scratch , but @entity10 proves time and again that it is incapable of getting the taxes of millions of ordinary taxpayers right			1
the fact they feel obliged to spend this much on training proves the tax system is far too complicated , meaning families and businesses find it unpredictable , punitive and burdensome			0
’ around six million people are being sent letters telling them that they have overpaid tax , and can expect to get back £ 2.5billion , the equivalent of £ 400 each			2
a further 1.2million , including more than 150,000 pensioners , face the shock of being told they did not pay enough			0
on average , they will have to find £ 600 each			2
meanwhile , @entity96 , @entity10 ’s permanent secretary on tax , has faced calls to resign after admitting ‘ making a mistake ’ in allowing the investment bank @entity99 to be let off paying its full tax bill			2
an @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ making sure our staff have the right skills is vital			2
we will take on the @entity13 ’s recommendations to ensure skills development happens where it is most needed			0
’ @entity10 has cut its staff numbers by 29 per cent since 2005 when the @entity110 was merged with @entity111			2

details of all procurement card expenditure over £ 500 are published every month by government departments to improve ‘ transparency ’			1
officials said many purchases were made by prison staff on behalf of inmates , who would repay them			2
' transparency needed ' : @entity152 from the @entity71 @entity152 of the @entity73 ’ @entity71 said : ‘ civil servants have legitimate expenses and procurement cards are actually an effective and efficient way to manage them , but it ’s clear that a culture of excess is rife in @entity160 and at town halls			0
' it ’s good news that the @entity120 has decided to publish its spending , as credit card abuse has got out of hand			1
‘ but publishing this spending should be very easy to do as it is simply a case of putting credit card statements online , so while it ’s good to see movements in the right direction , there ’s no reason for a £ 500 limit			1
‘ we need more transparency and accountability across the public sector as this will help to expose civil servants running up huge expenses and leaving them for taxpayers to pay			0
’ in august , the cards were used to spend £ 939.44 with beauty products supplier @entity184 , and £ 527.73 with @entity136 , which sells bodybuilding supplies			1

each card has a limit on any individual purchase			2
‘ between 2009/10 and 2010/11 spending on a procurement card fell by 13 per cent			2
‘ we have a zero tolerance policy on abuse of the system and disciplinary action will be taken against staff where there is evidence of wrongdoing			2

@entity208 was supposed to be off - site at least fortnightly to ‘ review the strategic direction ’ of @entity209 , in @entity210			2
the move , agreed by leading councillors , was abandoned after three months			0
the out - of - office day was among a number of management targets set out in a leaked document			1
mr @entity208 , who was paid £ 215,546 last year , is supposed to manage the organisation as it reduces in size by a third and ‘ maintain personal perspective and self - knowledge ’			1

but at the time the @entity254 was also trying to recruit more than 100 inspectors to check hospitals and care homes			0
