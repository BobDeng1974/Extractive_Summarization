a woman was saved from death by her coffee table after a disused central heating boiler exploded at her home			1
the explosion ripped through @entity9 ' @entity8 semi-detached home , turning her possessions into a pile of rubble and causing fragments and bricks to hit her and pierce one of her eyes			1
the 54 - year - old said she was told by firefighters she could have been chopped in half by the force of the blast but was probably saved by the coffee table in front of the fire , which shielded her from some of the explosion			1
' i was just sitting in the front room on the settee in front of the fire with my sister having a coffee and all of a sudden it was like a bomb had gone off			1
' it was terrifying - i did n't know what had happened			0
' i blanked for a bit and then started shouting for my sister			2
' firefighters said an old central heating boiler caused the explosion and mrs @entity9 could have been killed mrs @entity9 was left with bruises and was hit in the eye by flying mortar and debris after the explosion mrs @entity9 was x-rayed for potential damage to her pelvis and chest but luckily escaped any serious injury			1
her sister was not injured			2
mrs @entity9 likened the explosion to a bomb going off and said it had caused structural damage to the house			1
the care worker is now terrified to go into the living room where the explosion took place , and see the devastated remains of with its dented wall , piles of rubble and fragments of mortar littered across the floor			1
the fireplace has been turned into a pile of bricks and cupboard doors have been thrown around the room			2
she describes the explosion as like a bomb going off and is too scared to return to the living room flying debris caused severe damage to the walls , leaving them scorched and with dents and holes in she added : ' a fireman said if it had n't been for the coffee table in front of the fire protecting me i could have been chopped in half			1
' i have been so unnerved by this , i want to move out as soon as possible			0
someone dropped a leaflet through the door this morning and it terrified me			0
' her husband @entity113 said he lit their @entity116 fire , which uses solid fuel , at about 2.15pm and an hour later the boiler exploded			1
mrs @entity9 and her husband @entity120 ( right ) had only lived at the @entity8 property for ten weeks firefighters said mrs @entity9 ' coffee table probably saved her from being cut in half by the force of the blast @entity127 covers furniture in the living room after the powerful blast , which caused structural damage the walls have been damaged and pitted with holes by flying mortar following the large boiler explosion the fire is believed to have been in front of an old disused back boiler , which used to be used to heat home and contained water which would heat up as the fire did			1
these boilers can explode if they are left unused and empty			2
usually residual moisture left in the boiler turns to steam and as the back boiler gets heated pressure builds up and it gets extremely hot because it is empty , and then explodes			2
mr @entity113 said : ' @entity146 was screaming and shouting - i managed to break through the door and get them both out - it all happened so quickly			0
solid fuel back boilers consist of a fire grate which has material for lighting the fire , like coal			0
a jacket containing water is usually behind the fire , and heats up as the main fireplace does			0
however when boilers are sealed off or not used any more some water will remain and will eventually be heated to form steam - creating pressure			0
because of the lack of water the jacket becomes extremely hot - sometimes up to 700 degrees centigrade - and as internal pressure builds up it can explode			0
many boilers have been sealed off after people switched to gas or oil fired systems with remote controlled central heating			1
in the last five years three people have been injured by back boiler explosions and one died			0
' the fire service told us the explosion was probably down to the old back boiler having no water in it			1
' he said they were told the fire had been used by previous tenants and was safe to use and they had only lit for some extra warmth			0
the couple had only lived at the privately rented property for 10 weeks before the explosion took place at about 3pm on january 9			0
fire crews from @entity8 , @entity191 and a specialist rescue team from @entity193 attended the scene , along with a gas engineer			2
the damaged property and a neighbour 's house were made safe by firefighters			0
structural engineers from @entity201 and @entity202 have propped up the chimney breast			0
a spokesman for @entity206 service said : ' we would urge anyone who believes they may have a disused solid fuel back boiler in their home to seek professional advice about the appropriate protection or venting of the system , or having it removed completely			2
