by @entity0 @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 are today ’s @entity5 footballers ’ holiday destinations of choice			1
but 100 years ago , @entity8 descended across @entity9 , taking the sportsman of @entity11 — with varying degrees of rapidity — to the killing fields of @entity15 and @entity16			1
earlier this year a delegation of @entity19 football luminaries stood in a cold , windswept corner of northern @entity15			1
they saw @entity22 where second lieutenant @entity23 , a full back with @entity25 , won his @entity26			1
he had filled his pockets with grenades and attacked an enemy machine - gun post			1
writing home , he said of his deliverance : ‘ i am glad i have been so fortunate for @entity33 ’s sake , for i know he likes his lads to be top of the tree			1
hard life : offices and men play a game of football during the war respect : living and playing conditions were a whole lot different to the ones modern footballers now have first class : no expense is spared for the current crop of footballers these days he used to be always on about too much play and too little work , but my athletics came in handy this trip			1
we are out of the trenches at present and i am perfectly fit			1
the only thing is i am sore at elbows and knees with crawling over limestone flints			1
i believe that @entity65 is watching over me and it rests with him whether i pull through or not			1
’ five days after his bravery won him football ’s only @entity69 , he undertook a similarly brave raid and died , aged 25			1
his letter had yet to reach @entity11			1
@entity23 ’s wife of one month , @entity74 , was presented with his medal by @entity76 but , for all its many conspicuous war heroes , football ’s reluctance to stop playing as the conflict started damaged the sport ’s standing in public esteem			1
the first shot of what turned into war came with the assassination in @entity90 on june 28 , 1914 of archduke @entity91 , heir to the @entity92			1
yet the 38,000 spectators at the two - day @entity96 - @entity95 cricket match were more concerned with the state of the pitch than the affairs of mainland @entity9			1
soon , however , cricketers had hung up their pads to fight			1
a remarkable 34 first - class cricketers died during four years of fighting that started on august 4 , 1914			1
one of those was @entity106 of @entity107			1
he was a fast - medium bowler , tipped on the evidence of just one sighting by @entity110 — the @entity112 captain and one of the most important cricket figure of the age — as a future @entity11 player			1
but it was another @entity110 who gave jeeves immortality			1
@entity122 saw jeeves play for @entity123 in @entity124 and thought the name perfect for a resourceful valet , hence @entity127			1
the real jeeves was 28 when he died at @entity129 near @entity130 on july 22 , 1916			2
@entity131 : regarded as the inventor of modern batting			2
scored 1098 @entity134 runs for @entity11 between 1880 and 1899			2
@entity135 : one of the best bowlers of his generation			2
more than 2500 wickets for @entity140 and 100 in 19 tests			1
@entity142 : @entity11 rugby captain and wing			2
@entity145 : won silver at the @entity147 with the @entity149 rugby union team			2
@entity150 : welsh forward who played in his country ’s first international rugby match in 1881 — his only game for the national side			1
@entity157 : ran the 400m for @entity149 at the @entity147			2
@entity159 : @entity160 who won @entity162 four times			2
@entity164 : first driver to win the @entity15 @entity166 twice			1
@entity23 : @entity168 footballer , given the @entity26 for outstanding bravery			2
@entity170 : @entity171 who scored the only goal in @entity175 ’s @entity174 final win			2
others to perish were @entity135 of @entity140 and @entity11 , whose memorial stands at @entity178 in @entity179 , and @entity180 , who is famed for scoring the world record 628 in a house match , at @entity183 in 1899			2
the war also accounted for @entity131			2
the most famous sportsman of @entity186 , suffered a fatal heart attack when a @entity188 dropped a bomb on his patio in 1915			1
it was @entity193 ’s intervention , along with the heavy death toll of the @entity195 , that brought a cessation to the cricket season after initial opposition from government and the @entity200 , who decreed that ‘ no good purpose can be served at the moment by cancelling matches ’			2
yet the position was becoming unsustainable			2
@entity193 wrote in a letter to the @entity207 : ‘ the time has arrived when the country cricket season should be closed , for it is not fitting at a time like this that able - bodied men should be playing cricket by day ... i should like to see all first - class cricketers of suitable age set a good example and come to the help of their country without delay in its hours of need			1
’ the last first - class cricket match was played at @entity224 on september 2			2
the @entity200 declared ‘ the continuation of cricket is hurtful to the feelings of a section of the public ’			2
first - class cricket resumed in 1919			0
by then 210 cricketers had fought , including the @entity232 @entity231 , the ‘ flying hobgoblin ’ , an @entity234 golf blue , who wore his flying helmet over his turban			1
the spirit that sportsman took on to the battlefield was usually inculcated in the public schools , the mood of which was summed up in @entity245 ’s poem : and @entity11 ’s far , and honour a name / but the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks : / ‘ play up ! play up ! and play the game ! ’ in their book @entity251 and the @entity8 , @entity252 and @entity253 tell the story of captain @entity256 , of the @entity257 , a former captain of hockey and cricket and head boy at @entity261 , who bought four footballs for each of his platoons so they could kick their way across @entity267			1
@entity256 was as relaxed about the war as he might have been about a house match			0
legend : @entity131 was a batting sensation for @entity11 during the 19th century in a letter to his parents he said : ‘ as i write the shells are fairly haring over ; you know one gets sort of bemused after a few million			0
still , it ’ll be a great experience to tell one ’s children about			0
’ aged just 21 , he died on july 1 , 1916 at @entity279 , yards in front of the @entity282 wire			0
@entity157 , who ran for @entity149 in the 400metres at @entity286 in @entity287 ’s @entity147 , was the son of an @entity289 bishop and graduated from @entity234			0
he is also one of only three men to have been awarded the vc twice — for saving lives			0
‘ his courage and self - sacrifice were beyond praise , ’ read the citation in @entity293 of his first @entity26 , when he treated wounded soldiers at @entity295 in sight of the enemy			0
that evening he searched @entity267 for four hours			0
the following day he rescued three people from a shell hole 25 yards from the @entity282 trenches			0
as the current edition of the @entity311 newsletter reports , the citation read : ‘ although he was severely wounded while carrying a wounded soldier to the dressing station , he refused to leave his post and for two days not only continued to perform his duties but went round repeatedly under heavy fire to search for and attend to the wounded			0
’ @entity157 suffered a severe stomach injury when a shell exploded at an aid post , and died on august 4 , 1917 , aged 32			0
brilliant : @entity135 was one of the best bowlers of his generation @entity320 ’s deceased included @entity319 , the @entity11 captain and wing who had scored four tries against @entity15 in 1914			1
he was one of 26 @entity11 internationals to perish			0
thirty @entity325 rugby internationals died			0
@entity320 was responsible for founding one of the most distinguished sporting battalions , @entity329 ’ @entity328 , the idea of @entity11 back @entity329 , drawn from @entity331 and @entity332			0
the @entity333 is still played to this day between the @entity334 and the @entity335			0
from other sports , @entity159 , the @entity160 who won the @entity162 gentleman ’s singles four times , died			0
@entity166 racing driver @entity164 , of @entity15 , was shot down in a dogfight against five @entity282 fokkers			1
he crashed near @entity343 and died of the injuries			0
football matches were played by soldiers , occasionally of opposing sides , as at @entity348 in 1914 , which prompted the current @entity350 to commission a floodlit pitch to be built at @entity352			0
but , back home , our national sport had a mixed war			0
of course many men contributed greatly to the war effort , but not immediately			0
speaking to an @entity334 battalion , @entity359 of @entity360 summed up a growing anger at football ’s slowness in abandoning its fixture list , saying : ‘ i respect and honour you more than i can say			1
how different is your action from that of the men who can still go on with their cricket and football , as if the very existence of our nation were not at stake			0
’ champion : @entity159 won the prestigious @entity162 on four occasions the @entity174 and top two divisions played on			0
there was even the ‘ @entity383 ’ in 1915 , so called because of the number of soldiers attending in uniform			0
but when the @entity385 presented the @entity174 to @entity386 , who beat @entity388 , he declared it was everybody ’s duty to ‘ play a sterner game for @entity11 ’			0
the primacy of the war effort had been understood more readily over the border at @entity397 , where the manager @entity398 started up a @entity399 on november 26 , 1914			0
he said : ‘ now then , young men , as you have followed the old club through sunshine and rain , roll up in your hundreds for @entity407 , for right and freedom			0
do n’t let it be said that footballers are shirkers and cowards			1
’ three of the @entity397 team — @entity415 , @entity416 and @entity417 — died on the first day of the @entity419 offensive on july 1 , 1916			0
but damage to football ’s good name had already been done , denting its status as the principal winter sport of the public schools			0
by 1929 , the number of public and grammar schools affiliated to the @entity428 had more than quadrupled in a decade to 133			0
the oval - ball game was seen as a noble sport with @entity149 values			0
this trend caused @entity433 and @entity434 to argue in their book why @entity11 lose that ‘ only when there are @entity11 players with educated accents might the national team maximise its potential			0
’ the latest chance of many to prove that verdict wrong comes at the @entity445 in july , 2016 — the 100th anniversary of the @entity419 .			0

while footballers nowadays enjoy breaks to the likes of @entity1 and @entity3 it was a totally different story 100 years ago
many sportsman , not just footballers , fought for their country in @entity15 and @entity16
many failed to appreciate the *lengths* these sportsman took to show their respect and pride for their country
