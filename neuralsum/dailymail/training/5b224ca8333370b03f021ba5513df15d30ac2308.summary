a teenage girl has narrowly avoided death after smoking ' synthetic marijuana ' that she bought from a gas station and suffering a series of strokes			1
seventeen - year - old @entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , has been left with brain damage , paralysis and is unable to see after taking the synthetic weed with friends last december			1
her family is now hoping to raise awareness of the dangers of the substance , which is often labelled as ' potpourri ' , while campaigners battle for stricter laws to make it illegal across the country			1
fake weed , which is also known as ' @entity23 ' or ' @entity23 ' , is an herbal mixture doused with chemicals that trigger a high similar to smoking marijuana , according to the @entity27			2
former life : seventeen - year - old @entity6 started experiencing severe migraines in december , after smoking a synthetic weed she had bought from a gas station it is often sold as incense or potpourri , and is advertised as a legal alternative to weed			1
while many states have outlawed it , manufacturers have responded by slightly changing the compound so that it can return to shelves			0
@entity6 smoked the drug last december with friends and within 15 minutes , she told her boyfriend she was suffering from a migraine and needed to lay down			1
she suffered a series of strokes which left her in a psychotic - like state , during which she urinated on herself , ran into walls , hallucinated and acted violently , her sister told @entity50 's @entity49			1
the police were called to help restrain her into an ambulance , and she was taken to @entity53 , where she bit guardrails and attempted to bite medical staff			0
struck down : the drug caused her blood vessels to constrict and she suffered a series of strokes frightening : her family decided to take out her breathing tube - yet the teenager fought for life ' we thought once she comes down off the drug , we 'd take her home and show her the dangers of this drug , ' her older sister , @entity65 , said			1
' we did n't think it was as big of a deal until 24 hours later she was still violent and hurting herself			0
we realized you 're not supposed to stay high this long			0
' she was put into an induced coma as doctors carried out tests on her brain			0
doctors soon found @entity6 's strokes had caused severe vasculitis , meaning contracting blood vessels had constricted the flow of blood and cut off oxygen to her brain			1
' in four days ' time , we went from thinking everything is going to be ok and we 'll put her in drug rehabilitation to now you do n't know if she 's going to make it , ' stepfather @entity86 told @entity50			2
danger : @entity6 bought the legal ' fake weed ' @entity94 potpourri by @entity95 , above , from a gas station different life : @entity6 is now blind and largely paralysed but continues to make small improvements synthetic marijuana , which is known as ' @entity23 ' or ' @entity23 ' , is an herbal mixture sprayed with chemicals that create a high similar to smoking marijuana , according to the @entity27			1
advertised as a ' legal ' alternative to weed , it 's often sold as incense or potpourri			2
when many states outlawed the drug , manufacturers slightly changed the compound so they were no longer illegal			2
it was linked to 11,406 drug - related emergency department visits in 2010 , a study by the @entity112 found			1
most were aged 12 to 17			2
the first state laws banning synthetic drugs were established in 2010			2
now at least 41 states have banned them , but that has not deterred the manufacturers			0
' these drug manufacturers slightly change the chemical compound , and it becomes a different substance that 's not covered by the law , ' said @entity125 policy specialist @entity124			1
common side effects from smoking synthetic marijuana include bloodshot eyes , disturbed perceptions , a change in mood , paranoia , raised blood pressure or hallucinations			0
doctors soon found @entity6 's blood vessels were expanding again and while the family saw it as a sign of improvement , pressure on the teenager 's brain grew rapidly - and dangerously			1
surgeons had to drill a hole in her skull and insert a tube to relieve pressure			0
but her brain was still affected			0
' we met with neurology team who showed us @entity6 's brain images , ' her mother , @entity149 , said			1
' they told us that all white areas on images were dead			0
it looked to us at least 70 per cent of the images were white			0
' doctors said @entity6 would not be able to recognise her family and would never be able to use her arms or legs again			1
with this heart - breaking news , @entity6 's parents made the tough decision to take out her breathing tube and stopped all nourishment on december 16 - but she continued to fight			1
as her mother went to her room one morning , she said , ' good morning , i love you ' and was stunned to hear a hoarse voice saying : ' i love you too			0
' ' even though she could n't move , is blind , and could hardly be aware of what was going on around her , she laughed with us as we made jokes and listened to her soft whisper replies , ' @entity65 said			2
' it is my little sister shining through , in every way she can manage , with every ounce of strength			0
' struggle : @entity6 , pictured hooked up to an @entity185 , has started eating solid food again in an encouraging sign new world : @entity6 is believed to have smoked the fake weed with friends after buying it from a gas station @entity6 knows where she is and recognises her family , but every day is still shrouded in confusion			1
the family does not know how much control she will recover , but she is already moving her arms and legs , and two weeks ago she started eating solid food again			2
@entity6 's parents have started a nonprofit organization called @entity202 to educate teenagers and parents about the dangers of synthetic marijuana use			1
' @entity207 want to let kids and parents know about the warnings signs : migraines and withdrawal , ' @entity86 said			0
' we all know the warning signs of alcohol and cocaine , but with this synthetic weed stuff , it 's so new that nobody knows about this stuff			0
we want to let other parents know about this so they do n't have to go what we 've been going through			0
' lack of awareness : @entity6 's family said they had no idea how dangerous the fake marijuana could be and are now spreading awareness to educate other teenagers and students @entity86 said he knew @entity6 used real marijuana occasionally , and told her she would be grounded if he ever caught her smoking			1
' had i thought that there was any chance that she could have been hurt by this stuff , i would have been a lot more vigilant			0
i had no idea it was so bad , ' @entity86 told @entity50			0
' i 'd never have thought we 'd be in this situation			0
if she had bought it off the street or from a corner , that 's one thing , but she bought it from convenience store			2
