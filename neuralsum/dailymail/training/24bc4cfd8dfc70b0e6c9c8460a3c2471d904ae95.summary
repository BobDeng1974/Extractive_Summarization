@entity2 was the man to whom the @entity59 first confided his battle with depression			1
yet when the telephone call came telling him his job was going , @entity2 took possession of his own black cloud			1

' i watched them and started doing the things i had n't done for a while			0
' i went to see friends in the game , i got around training grounds			2
' then a chance came up to work at @entity77 with my mate @entity76 and i felt i could n't turn it down			1

then i said , " you know what ? i 'm ready now "			0

the pitch outside is barren and bare , but he has his family back and a job in @entity145 football			2

' i 'm back in the game now and loving the day to day involvement at @entity72 and passing on the knowledge of everything i 've learned			1
' he will watch sunday 's @entity154 meeting between @entity17 and @entity11 with his 15 - year - old son , a curious bystander in the circus of @entity44 life			1
' he remembers little bits of life up there and has seen the clips on @entity162 , but he has been asking me a few questions recently about it			0
why it is how it is , the bigotry and stuff			0
it 's difficult to explain			2
' @entity2 won four @entity171 league titles , three @entity171 cups , two @entity173 and reached a @entity174			1
he spent seven years at @entity17 , scoring a goal against @entity11 for every season at the club			1

all of them at @entity180			0
the 41 - year - old was sent off three times against @entity11 , all at @entity180 , during seven years at @entity17 ' there was a red in my very first @entity187 game , ' he grimaces			1
' the gaffer ( @entity57 ) nearly ripped my head off after the game			2
' he was physically trying to get at me			0
we were in the game â€“ @entity11 had just gone 2 - 1 ahead and i got sent off and it went 3 - 1 then 4 - 1 and finished at five			2
' he came at me and i thought , " s * * t my @entity17 career is finished before it 's begun "			1
' honestly , the way he was talking to me after the game			2
@entity57 could be ruthless when he wanted to be			0
' thankfully i redeemed myself in the next @entity11 game at @entity54			2
i scored the only goal of a 1 - 0 win			0
' he pleads guilty to two of the reds , but has a well rehearsed defence for the other			0
' the @entity207 one ( in 2004 ) was definitely not a red card , i never made contact			0
' we did n't even come together and he went down as if someone had taken him out with a sawn off shotgun			0
@entity2 ( right ) scraps with @entity11 ' @entity214 in the @entity215 in 2003 ' funny enough , we ended up working together at @entity68			1
' the first man to be capped for @entity218 while a @entity17 player @entity2 scored seven goals in @entity44 derbies - as many as @entity221 and @entity222			1
' i 'm quite proud of that , ' he admits			2
' i remember smashing one in off the bar over @entity227			0
and sutty chipping one into the far corner , that 's my favourite that one			2
' you go into this coaching side of things and people talk about systems , but you realise in teams like that it 's not systems that win games			1
' players win games , not systems			0
we just had good players who knew their roles			0
' @entity221 's partnership with @entity248 was n't something we worked on in training			2
it was just two top football players who knew each other 's games			1
' we had a chemistry as a team			0
' you would turn round in the tunnel before a game and say , ' i trust him , i trust him , i trust him			2
' ' we all lived in and around @entity44 , be it @entity263 or @entity264			0
you could meet in the city centre			0
we were a close bunch			0
' @entity2 is shown a red card by referee @entity268 during @entity17 's 3 - 1 defeat by @entity11 in 2005 the bond of trust with @entity27 was broken for a time			1
as his best mucker , trips to the city centre could be a fraught affair			0
' it 's quite unique in @entity44 , ' says @entity2 matter of fact			1
' there is no place quite like it			2
' the importance of football is amazing , it 's a massive part of people 's lives			1
' sometimes now i miss it			0
' i 'll sit and watch the @entity187 game on sunday and think , ' i 'd love to be playing in that today			2
' ' then you think about the stick and the grief after it and feel relieved you 're not involved any longer			0
' you have to be careful what you do in that city , there is no hiding place			2
you have to know that when you are there			0
' i never got it like @entity27 did			0
there were a few isolated incidents , but what @entity27 went through was on a different scale			0
i would have hated that			0
' here in @entity72 it 's totally different			1
' on a blustery , grey january day there is little pleasure to be had on the legendary beach , yet @entity2 's outlook is bright			1
he left @entity17 as player and coach under a cloud , but can speak readily about both now			1
it 's progress of a sort			2
( left to right ) @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity2 and @entity27 celebrate winning the title in 2012 ' the way it ended for me first time was horrible			1
' but , you know , i won four titles and the two i lost was on goal difference and by a point			0
how bad can that be ? ' he would n't swap his current existence at the foot of @entity218 's @entity327 for that of @entity329			1
@entity2 looks at the @entity330 and sees an @entity187 novice cursed by a @entity17 team with no @entity333 , @entity334 or @entity335 to speak of			1
' it 's evident to see the fixture does n't have the same players now			2
it does n't take an expert to see that			0
' people down here would struggle to name many players at @entity17 and @entity11 now			1
' @entity346 is down here now			0
@entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 might be looking down here as well			0
i 'm guessing it 's been a while since anyone significant at all has come down from @entity11			2
' but there 's no football place quite like @entity44			1
it 's a unique city and a unique game for the simple reason that people still care			1
