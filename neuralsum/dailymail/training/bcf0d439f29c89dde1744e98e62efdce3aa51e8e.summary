mr @entity3 ’ research revealed @entity32 was moored off @entity17 at that moment as @entity7 prepared to chase the @entity37 fleet through the @entity38			1
the hunt came to a head at @entity41			2
he sourced weather reports and tidal information from the time so he could tell exactly which way the ship was pointed and got her position to within 10 yards			1
he used historic photos to discover what the topography of @entity17 looked like in 1805 and commissioned a marine artist to paint the background			2
the ship is housed in a specially - designed glass case that is airtight and temperature controlled with carefully arranged lighting that shows off the green glass sea			2
behind the @entity32 is the rest of the fleet that includes the frigates active and @entity61 that arrived to tell @entity7 of the @entity37 fleet ’s movement			1
dedicated modeller @entity3 spent more than 10 years on the painstaking project that was meticulously researched by him the ship is made out of 12 varieties of fruit woods and the hull even includes copper below the waterline on the ship herself the signal flying from the mizzen mast reads ' unmoor ' , meaning one anchor is being raised , suggesting they were preparing to sail			1

mr @entity3 , from @entity105 , @entity106 , who is semi-retired from the family ’s wine and spirit business , said : ' my grandfather was a marine artist and built two ivory models so it was in my genes			0
heave ho ! mr @entity3 , from @entity105 , @entity106 , wanted to pick a specific time in @entity32 's life the grandfather said he managed to pin - point the location of @entity32 to within 10 feet mr @entity3 flew out to @entity17 for a week and took photos for his project ' it took 10 years to complete and i wanted to pick a specific time in @entity32 ’s life			1
it could n’t be when she had no sails up or when she was at sea with all her sails up			0
' i chose the time in january 1805 and this was when the fleet was blockading @entity130 and @entity32 had left for @entity17 for supplies			2
' while there @entity7 learned that the @entity37 had left the port and at this time he was preparing to sail			1
' i managed to pin - point the location of @entity32 to within 10 feet , but had to find out how the magnetism had changed over the years so i could find the bearings taken at the time			1
' i also found out what the tide was like at the time , and the weather			0
i flew out there for a week and took photos and also found some very old photographs of @entity17			0
' i built the model in the same way @entity32 had been built			0
this illustration shows @entity7 mortally wounded at the @entity41 , with his death in the cockpit of @entity2 a general view of @entity2 in @entity149 , @entity150 ' i used about 12 different types of wood and made planks and the hull			1
' she is fully rigged and the rigging took over a third of the total time to make the model			2
' another big job was the sea and in the end i used coloured glass , but it has to have the correct lighting or it changes colour			0
' the glass is about six inches deep and makes the whole thing very heavy - about 140 kilos			0
' there are 152 men on the model , which my wife @entity171 painted			0
' he added : ' i am selling it to help raise money for my grandchildren ’s education			0
it has been sitting in my study for the last 15 years since i finished it			0
