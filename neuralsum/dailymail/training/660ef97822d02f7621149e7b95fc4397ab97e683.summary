by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 4 june 2012 updated : 17:13 est , 4 june 2012 under scrutiny : @entity2 is to be investigated by the parliamentary watchdog @entity4 has referred @entity2 to his independent adviser on ministerial interests over an official trip she made to @entity8 with a business partner			1
it is the first time the prime minister has referred a minister to sir @entity13 , who rules on whether politicians have broken the @entity15			2
the move contrasts with mr @entity4 ’s refusal to ask sir @entity13 to investigate culture secretary @entity19 over his closeness to the @entity22 media empire			2
@entity2 yesterday issued a grovelling apology for failing to disclose her shared business interest with @entity25 , a relative			1
the beleaguered @entity27 co-chairman apologised for any ‘ embarrassment to the government ’			1
in response , the @entity11 said : ‘ there are clearly some lessons for future handling and i have asked @entity13 , my adviser on ministers ’ interests , to consider the issues that have been raised			1
’ @entity2 ’s position is precarious because she is unpopular with some @entity27 backbenchers , who want mr @entity4 to appoint an mp to the @entity27 chairmanship to give the position more authority			1
@entity43 , however , is understood to rate the minister and is keen to keep her in the @entity45			0
one rumour is that she could be given the job of international development secretary , in charge of @entity52 ’s aid programme , in a reshuffle later this year			0
pressure : @entity4 is being attacked by @entity55 for referring @entity2 to sir @entity56 but not @entity19 however , if sir @entity13 rules against her , it could spell the end for her ministerial career			0
the referral relates to an undeclared relationship with mr @entity25 , who accompanied her to @entity8 in july 2010 and assisted the @entity66 with outreach events there			0
she said mr @entity25 was her husband ’s second cousin and this fact was ‘ widely known ’			0
but she added that she did not realise the need to declare they had ‘ a common business interest as minority shareholders in a small food company ’			1
@entity78 ’s @entity77 , shadow cabinet office minister , said : ‘ @entity2 clearly has very serious questions to answer			2
‘ but @entity4 ’s actions in this case draw into sharp relief his refusal to hold a similar investigation into @entity19 , despite clear evidence that he broke the @entity15 by misleading the @entity86 on at least three occasions			0
