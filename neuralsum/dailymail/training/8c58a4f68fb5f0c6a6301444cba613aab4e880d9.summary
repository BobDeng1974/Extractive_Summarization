by @entity0 former @entity2 defender @entity1 last week caused consternation when he accused the @entity4 of ' buying trophies ' and ' shutting the door ' to young talent			1
however , the @entity9 's remarks were greeted with wry smiles by the powers - that - be at the @entity12 , for @entity1 actually pleaded to cross the divide and join @entity4 in the summer of 2010			1
after spending two years with @entity15 , the curtain was coming down on @entity1 's career when he approached @entity4 to offer his services			1
@entity2 : @entity1 for played for @entity2 for nine years before moving to @entity15 ad then @entity19 @entity1 , for nine years a player at @entity21 between 1999 and 2008 , made the remarks at a promotional event in his role as a @entity2 ambassador in the @entity26 last week			1
speaking to the @entity28 , a @entity4 insider said : ' @entity1 came to us when his contract had expired at @entity15 and asked if we would be interested in signing him			2
' in fact , he was a bit desperate about it			0
it was a touch embarrassing to see a former @entity2 player in such obvious need of a final pay day			0
' there was never any chance of @entity1 coming to @entity4 , of course , but it seems he 's now got an ace to grind			0
embarrassing : @entity4 bought players from all over the @entity43 but said they had no interest in @entity1 rivals : @entity1 watches on as @entity46 puts @entity4 1 - 0 up against @entity2 ' we read his comments about @entity4 with a mixture of surprise and amusement , given they were made by a player who made it clear he was happy to come and play for a club he apparently has no respect for if we paid his wages			2
' there used to be a time when it was said that @entity4 spoke more about @entity2 than their own club - but it seems the opposite is true now			0
' it would be interesting to see if @entity66 is aware of the money both @entity69 clubs have spent in the transfer market during 2014			0
