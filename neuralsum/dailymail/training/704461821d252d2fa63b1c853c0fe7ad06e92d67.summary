by @entity1 reporter hundreds of @entity3 interns have flooded a @entity5 apartment complex and the full - time residents say their partying and late hours have gotten out of control			1
the much sought after internships afford the lucky college students salaries of upwards of $ 6,000 per month and , apparently , also afford the free time needed to throw a raucous party			1
meanwhile , the children and families who already called @entity17 apartments in @entity19 home are wishing these twenty - somethings would go back to where they came from			1
surprise ! last month , at least 400 @entity3 interns were moved into @entity19 , @entity25 's posh @entity17 apartments , much tot he chagrin of full - time residents party time : residents say the interns like these , who are paid a whopping $ 6,000 per month over the summer , began partying in communal areas like the pool and courtyards of the 1,750 - unit complex almost immediately until this year , reports @entity36 , @entity3 did something more typical for its fresh - faced interns : the company offered them a living stipend and told them to find a place of their own			1
this year , the tech giant put its summer interns up in the high - end complex of some 1,700 apartments , which rent for upwards of $ 3,375 per month			1
there are swimming pools , tennis courts , a fitness center , basketball court , and even a wine room and full - time activities director			1
a facebook page called @entity57 has nearly 400 members			2
though the page was up early monday , as of around noon it had been taken down or suspended			0
the intern pictures represented here were found through the group page before it was taken down but are not necessarily the students to blame for @entity17 complaints			0
a @entity67 review calling it a ‘ pretty bad ’ situation said parties happen all week long and that security at @entity17 has been powerless to stop it			0
pricey : aside from the lucky interns , @entity17 houses families and commuting @entity75 professionals in apartments that run as much as $ 3,375 per month			1
the interns stay for free			1
all inclusive : the interns also dine , travel , and participate in group leisure activities for free last month , a list of rules and reminders were distributed throughout the complex			1
among them was a request to ‘ honor the “ quiet enjoyment ” of your neighbors			0
’ another reminded tenants of the pool hours of 10 to 8			0
what ’s worse , the residents were n’t told all those students were coming			2
‘ at first i thought it was summer camp , ’ resident @entity100 , 46 , told @entity36 ‘ but then i noticed that the kids were too old			1
’ photos like these dot the @entity107 accounts of the prestigious interns , many of them grouped on an official @entity57 page @entity100 said the interns do n’t bother her as much because she ’s on the top floor , but that neighbors have complained about crazy behavior from the temporary residents			1
and outside her apartment , @entity100 said the interns have , at times , been a nuisance			2
‘ they dart out into the middle of the street , ’ @entity100 said			0
‘ they jaywalk all the time			0
i have to be very careful when i 'm driving			0
’ the internship also reportedly includes free transportation , food , and other unbelievable amenities			1
it ’s almost as if the recent @entity130 / @entity129 comedy comes to life when the students arrive at @entity133			0
to blame ? one neighbor in the @entity19 complex took to @entity67 , ' the situation is pretty bad ' and said the loud partying occurs throughout the week in communal areas such as the one pictured yes or no ? a comedy about just how posh the @entity3 intern positions are was coincidentally released last month and stars @entity130 and @entity129 rainbow - colored glasses : the film seems to have drawn at least some of its inspiration from reality in fact , the internship is about two men who land the dream position at @entity3			1
one less lucky intern , who is working at @entity152 for the summer , has nonetheless been lucky enough to befriend a @entity3 intern			2
‘ it 's pretty fun , ’ he said of @entity17 , calling the parties held four or five times a week ‘ sort of normal college parties			0
' one temporary issue ' : one @entity67 reviewer of @entity17 ( pictured ) bemoaned the annoying summer - long stay of the highly - paid students , but admitted it was , at least , temporary ‘ you put a bunch of 20 - year - olds in the same place , and what do you expect , ’ he said			2
thankfully for the annoyed residents , they expect the invasion to end rather soon			2
‘ it 's like a dorm now , ’ wrote another @entity67 user who rated the complex highly and called the interns a ‘ temporary issue			0
’ ‘ i could hear a lot of noise , people talking and singing even in the middle of the night			0
the sound - proof is pretty good if i close the windows , but it 's summer time , i want some fresh and cool air			0
’ shutdown : after reports emerged monday of the interns ' behavior , someone quickly suspended a @entity107 page dedicated to @entity57 ( screen shot pictured here )			0

' i thought it was summer camp ' : around 400 interns moved into the @entity197 in @entity19 last month and residents were *n't* warned
the *coveted* positions *pay* $ *6,000/month* with free food , transportation , and leisure activities
