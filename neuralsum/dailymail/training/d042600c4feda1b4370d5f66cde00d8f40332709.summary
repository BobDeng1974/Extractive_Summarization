slaughtered : marmite the micro pig , pictured , was loaned to a school because he was lonely at home a woman who loaned her beloved micro pig to a local school to stop the animal getting lonely was shocked to find out her pet had been sent to slaughter			1
@entity9 , 21 , was given @entity10 as a present , but ' loaned ' him to a local infant school so he would no longer be stuck in the house and could meet other pigs			1
miss @entity9 , who works in a sweet shop , would visit her ' docile ' porcine friend several times a week in his new home at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 - but one day he was no longer in his pen			1
when she investigated @entity10 's fate , the school revealed that they had sent the animal off to be killed because of his ' aggressive ' behaviour			1
it is claimed he bit a school site manager and even tried to attack a pupil			2
miss @entity9 , who says @entity10 was only loaned to the school , was ' devastated ' by the news , and says they had no right to kill her pet			1
however , officials from the school have claimed they were within their rights to take the drastic step , consulted a vet first and even asked miss @entity9 to take the pig back			1
' my parents bought me @entity10 as a present for my 21st birthday and i was ecstatic			2
i treated him very much like a pet rather than livestock and he lived in the house with us as a member of the family			0
' he was so soft and domesticated that he would sit on my lap in front of the tv , and let me stroke him			0
he would even give me kisses and cuddles			0
when you called his name , he would recognise it and come running like a dog			0
devastated : @entity9 is pictured above outside the enclosure where she used to visit her porcine friend ' docile ' : miss @entity9 described how her pig was calm and loving , although school officials say he bit a member of staff ' unfortunately , it became clear he was a little lonely and i thought he would benefit from socialising with other pigs			1
you would not be alone in thinking that @entity10 seems on the large size for a micro pig			1
however the animals , which shot to popularity because of their pint - sized reputation , are only truly tiny when they are piglets			2
adult micro pigs can easily grow to knee - height , and some shocked owners have had to content with the beasts growing even larger and causing chaos at home			1
' i contacted @entity91 school because i knew they had other animals and they said they would be delighted to take him			2
' they had a female pig they wanted to mate and they said @entity10 would make the perfect stud			1
' i took him to the school on the understanding he would be boarding there			0
i was n’t giving them ownership			0
i thought he would have a dream new start in life with some other pigs to keep him company			0
' @entity10 was placed into a pen with two other pigs in january this year , and within two months he was dead			2
miss @entity9 said : ' i visited him at the school three times a week and my mum would drive past every day			1
' you could see him from the pathway outside the school , so i never needed to go in			0
however , one day we realised he had disappeared , which was extremely worrying			0
new home : @entity10 was sent to the school so that he could mix with other pigs			1
he is pictured left in the enclosure dispute : the school says it was within its rights to kill @entity10 , and tried to offer him back to miss @entity9 first relocated : @entity10 was sent to @entity20 , pictured , where he lived with other pigs ' the school told us he had been aggressive towards the other pigs and moved to a separate pen			1
however , he was so docile and half the size of the ones they had			0
' the school ’s other male was older than @entity10 and even had tusks			1
' miss @entity9 said she offered to take @entity10 back or help to find him another home , though the school disputes this			1
' devastated ' : miss @entity9 would visit her porcine friend three times a week until his unexpected demise but she also claims the school then sent him to slaughter at @entity142 in nearby @entity143 without letting her know			1
she said : ' when i found out @entity10 had been killed i was devastated			2
i could n’t believe it and i was just screaming			0
the school had no right to kill my pet , who i loved so much			2
people should imagine how they would feel if somebody did that to their dog			0
' the school said it removed the pig upon the recommendation of a vet and attempted to find suitable housing for him on another site			2
headteacher @entity160 said : ' after a few weeks the new pig became extremely aggressive and attacked our two other pigs			0
it also bit the site manager and tried to bite a child			0
' we contacted our vet and were advised to remove the pig from our site for the health and safety of the children and the other animals			0
' the previous owners were contacted by the school to notify them of this development , but at no point did they offer to have it back or to help rehouse it			0
' our farm manager approached as many local farms as possible to rehouse the pig , but nobody wanted it because it was a boar			0
