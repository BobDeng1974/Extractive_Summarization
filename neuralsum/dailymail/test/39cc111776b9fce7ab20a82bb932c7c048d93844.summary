a cheeky monkey was captured on camera snatching a banana from a female tourist before slapping her @entity4 when she got too close			1
filmed in the @entity7 town of @entity8 , the monkey approaches the woman , who holds a banana , with its outstretched hands			1
grabbing it in both hands , the monkey takes a small bite before pulling it from its skin , which he leaves with the lady			0
removing her hand from the shot , the lady can be heard laughing as the greedy monkey begins tucking into the banana while its friends sit around and watch			0
moving in for a closer look , the woman leans forward and the monkey copies her by lunging forward itself			0
getting right up into the camera ’s lens the monkey appears to sniff it while diverting its eyes , as if hoping that it is food			1
the cheeky money snatches the banana from the woman 's hand and begins scoffing it down realising that it is out of luck , it returns to its original position and continues tucking into the banana			1
the lady once again begins moving closer to the monkey , but the primate is less keen to play this time			0
cradling its food under its arm as if protecting it from the oncoming threat , the monkey raises its left hand and gives the camera a slap			1
up close and personal ! the curious monkey gets right up to the camera lens and gives it a sniff startled by the monkey ’s reaction , its friend who sits next to it looks genuinely shocked and rather hilariously raises its eyebrows in surprise			2
the video concludes with the monkey , satisfied that the threat has gone , eating the remainder of the banana			0
the footage was captured by @entity77 and @entity78 , a pair who describe themselves on their @entity82 channel as a ‘ young married couple with an impulse to explore , film and edit great travel moments			2
