by @entity0 it seems everyone is jumping on the virtual reality bandwagon - from @entity4 to @entity5 to , more surprisingly , @entity6			2
the main problem with the technology , however , is its price			0
to solve this , a @entity11 firm has developed a cheap headset that takes advantage of the technology found in everyday phones			2
called @entity18 , it uses rounded lenses and apps to show 3d images , and head movements are tracked using the phone ’s built - in gyroscope			1
the @entity18 headset , pictured , was unveiled at @entity11 's @entity26 by makers @entity27			1
it consists of straps and a plastic case for phones with 4.7 - inch screens or larger			1
the phone is strapped in front of the wearer 's face and rounded lenses separate the display to appear in front of each eye , causing a 3d effect variations of virtual reality have been around for years , in particular in flight and driving simulators , but it 's popularity has risen recently due to companies such as @entity49			1
its @entity51 headset began life as a @entity54 project and was bought by @entity6 earlier this year in a deal said to be worth around $ 2 billion			2
a consumer version is expected later this year			0
@entity4 announced its own headset , under @entity58 , in march			0
the adjustable device features a head - mounted display with @entity62 resolution and a 90 - degree field of view , while sensors built into the headset track head movements			1
in april , @entity5 bought smart glasses specialist @entity67 and rumours suggest its working on its own augmented and virtual reality gadget for players of its @entity72			0
the harness was developed by @entity27 , which recently demonstrated the technology at @entity11 ’s @entity26 event			1
while development kits for one of the most well - known headsets , @entity51 , start at $ 350 ( € 254 or £ 207 ) , the @entity18 is expected to retail for just € 50 ( $ 68 or £ 40 )			1
the @entity80 headset consists of rubber straps and a plastic case for phones with 4.7 - inch screens or larger			1
the phone is strapped in front of the wearer ’s face and rounded lenses separate the display to appear in front of each eye			1
apps show each eye different versions of the same image to create @entity97 , stereoscopic effect			1
this effect , as well as any potential lag , then depends on the quality of the phone ’s processor , accelerometer and gyroscope			1
@entity27 said it is hoping to officially launch the device ‘ later this summer ’ , but a developer kit could be released as early as next month			2
it is also working on a series of games including a zombie shooter currently being used during demonstrations			0
others include a flying , and racing game			0
@entity114 could be about to enter the virtual reality race , if reports about an upcoming headset are true			0
the @entity119 firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to test , and the final product could launch by the end of the year			0
it would rival @entity4 's @entity58 headset , pictured @entity51 began life as a @entity54 project and was bought by @entity6 earlier this year in a deal said to be worth around $ 2 billion			2
a consumer version is expected later this year			0
@entity4 announced its own headset , under @entity58 , in march			0
the adjustable device features a head - mounted display with @entity62 resolution and a 90 - degree field of view , while sensors built into the headset track head movements			1
in april , @entity5 bought smart glasses specialist @entity67 for $ 150 million ( £ 88 million )			2
rumours suggest it is working on its own augmented and virtual reality gadget , called @entity140 , for players of its @entity72			0
@entity114 was one of the first major companies to launch a smartwatch , after @entity4 , and is among the pioneers of the curved tv screen industry			0
@entity114 could be hoping to steal a charge against its rivals , including @entity6 's @entity51 , pictured , and be the first to sell its virtual reality headset to customers			0
