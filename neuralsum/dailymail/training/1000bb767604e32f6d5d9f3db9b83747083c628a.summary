' the unravelling of the @entity24 family began in 2005 when her father started losing weight , tanning and acting strangely , even disappearing for days at a time			1
until then , the children had had a ' loving and affectionate ' @entity140 childhood with their father , their beautiful mother and eight children - four of which were from the @entity59			0

he also told her that he had killed his brother in their bathtub , had a burning desire to kill one of his daughters and offered to kill her husband for her if she so wished , the @entity31 reports			2
when @entity113 and @entity27 threatened to have @entity24 's death investigated if they did n't get custody of their sisters , @entity24 dropped his children off the next day and never saw them again			1
but after that he waged a furious campaign of intimidation telling his daughters he would ' destroy them '			0
