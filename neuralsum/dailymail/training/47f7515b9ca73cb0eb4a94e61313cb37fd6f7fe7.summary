it might look like a child 's toy thrown into the snow , but this is the stunning design for a ski lodge			1
@entity7 architecture firm atelier 8000 has proposed an incredibly unique take on a typical mountain accommodation - and the designs are spectacular			2
their @entity11 , a concept designed for an international competition , is a futuristic , sustainable structure made of aluminum , glass and solar panels			1
oh , and did we mention that it 's a cube that has been entirely rotated onto one of its corners ? the contemporary building is intended to be situated high in the @entity24 and will be able to function completely off the grid , even at such a high altitude			1
designed to merge into the mountainous background , almost as if part of a retreating glacier , the construction amplifies the use of light and shadows - much like that which can be observed on neighbouring rocks			2
the shape of the hut allows the building to utilise solar energy to the maximum possible extent , with the panels that generate energy facing southwards and eastwards			0
perfect for adventurous hikers and travellers , the five - storey building includes extensive ski storage space , two floors of guest rooms , an attic meditation room , a restaurant and a deck			0
plus , its orientation provides plenty of intimate corners where visitors can relax and enjoy breathtaking views			0
in the warmer months , guests will be able to relax on the hotel 's patio , which wraps around two of the building 's sides			0
