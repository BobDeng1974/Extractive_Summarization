@entity0 is on @entity2 ’s shortlist to be co-commentator when their @entity5 coverage starts next season			1
@entity0 , who is working for @entity7 , based in @entity8 , made two guest appearances in that role during @entity2 ’s @entity12 broadcasts last season and would jump at the chance to return to mainstream @entity15 on a regular basis			2
@entity2 , who need to augment their football talent before taking up exclusive live @entity20 rights for the @entity5 , are expected to finalise their plans in january			0
@entity0 ( left ) works for @entity7 but may return to @entity5 football with @entity2 next season @entity23 missed @entity24 v @entity25 on sunday to travel to @entity26 instead @entity23 ( left ) went to watch his horse @entity28 run in @entity26 instead of working for @entity2 @entity0 is widely acknowledged as football ’s best co-commentator			1
but after the storm over sexist comments about female assistant referee @entity34 that led to his departure from @entity36 in 2011 , @entity0 ’s appointment would have to be approved by @entity2 ’s new chief @entity37			2
a women ’s campaign group criticised @entity2 for using @entity0 in the @entity12			0
however , it might be more than coincidental that news of a @entity2 move for @entity0 has emerged after @entity23 chose to watch his horse @entity28 run in the @entity43 ’ @entity12 meeting in the @entity26 rather than work on @entity2 ’s @entity24 v @entity25 match last saturday			1
@entity2 are understood to have been disappointed by @entity23 ’s decision to put his racing interests before his football commitments and have made that very clear to him			0
so much so that if @entity23 misses another game in similar circumstances , there could be a parting of the ways .			0
