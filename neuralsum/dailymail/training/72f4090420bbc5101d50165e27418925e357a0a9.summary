by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 06:48 est , 18 september 2013 a mother has suffered the horror of seeing both of her children diagnosed with brain tumours			2
@entity5 , 46 , was stunned when her 12 - year - old son @entity7 was diagnosed a brain tumour soon after his older sister @entity9 , 24			1
doctors say having two young siblings with brain tumours is ‘ extremely rare ’			2
@entity5 's daughter @entity9 had surgery to remove a benign brain tumour in 2008			1
in may this year , her son , @entity7 , was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour however , ms @entity5 believes the double diagnosis may have actually saved @entity7 ’s life because the family recognised his symptoms from @entity9 , enabling him to have an early scan			1
‘ @entity7 started complaining about headaches and having too much air in his head and it was like deja vu , ’ said ms @entity5 from @entity22 , @entity23			1
‘ people told me that lightning never strikes twice and there was no way he could have a brain tumour too , but i recognised the signs			2
‘ he had the mri scan and it was absolutely gut - wrenching to be given the news , but if i had n’t gone through it with @entity9 i would n’t have noticed the signs and two months later it may have been too late			2
’ @entity7 was diagnosed with a malignant tumour in may after complaining about headaches and feeling sick , whilst @entity9 had a benign brain tumour five years ago			1
both siblings suffered with sickness and headaches , which were so bad they would scream in pain			0
@entity9 was diagnosed after develop nausea and headaches			1
she also started to sleep for up to 14 hours a day , experienced double vision and struggled to walk @entity9 ( pictured after her operation ) said that doctors initially thought she was suffering from an inner ear infection but that she was eventually diagnosed after having an @entity58 scan ‘ it is very rare to have one family member with a brain tumour , but to have two is very , very rare - it ’s pure bad luck , ’ said ms @entity5 , who runs her own cleaning business			1
‘ it took @entity9 six months to be diagnosed so with @entity7 as soon as he started showing similar symptoms i was n’t taking any chances			1
’ @entity9 began feeling ill in 2007 when she was 18			2
she was soon sleeping for up to 14 hours a day , suffering from double vision and struggling to walk			0
‘ i had headaches and neck pain and went to the doctors , but nothing they suggested made any difference			0
i thought maybe i was just eating badly , ’ she said			0
‘ then i went home at the end of the first term of university and was really sick on @entity80			0
soon i was being sick most days and losing weight			0
’ @entity7 ( pictured before his illness ) was diagnosed quickly after developing nausea and headaches because ms @entity5 recognised the symptoms as similar to those suffered by @entity9 @entity7 ( pictured on holiday in @entity89 ) had to have ten hours of surgery to remove his tumour			1
he now requires a year of chemotherapy ms @entity5 took @entity9 to @entity95 , where they suspected she had an inner ear infection , but the pain continued and in february she eventually had an mri scan , which showed she had a benign brain tumour			1
she has since had check - ups every six months and was recovering well when in january this year @entity7 started complaining of similar symptoms			1
‘ he started feeling ill in january and i put it down to his picky eating , then he came home from holiday in march complaining about headaches too , ’ said ms @entity5			1
@entity7 was given an @entity58 in may which found the malignant medulloblastoma and he had 10 hours of surgery at @entity111 in @entity112 to remove it			1
he has since had a course of radiotherapy and will spend the next 12 months being treated with chemotherapy			1
ms @entity5 said : ' @entity7 started complaining about headaches and having too much air in his head and it was like deja vu			1
people told me lightening never strikes twice and there was no way he could have a brain tumour too , but i recognised the signs ' ‘ it ’s a difficult time but we are just so pleased we caught @entity7 ’s brain tumour when we did , ’ said ms @entity5			1
‘ we do n’t know what caused the brain tumours			0
there needs to be more research done into them			0
’ dr @entity138 , consultant paediatric oncologist at @entity111 in @entity112 , said : ‘ the vast majority of brain tumours affecting children are sporadic - the cause is unknown , and they just come out of the blue			0
‘ inherited brain tumours are very rare , and when they occur , are usually associated with other inherited conditions			0
‘ it is therefore extremely rare to encounter two siblings who have both had brain tumours , and of different types			0
’ @entity9 still has to go for check - ups every six months			2
@entity7 had surgery to remove the tumour and he is now undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy the family is now raising money for brain tumour charities			1
image shows @entity9 doing a parachute jump to raise money for @entity164 @entity163 dr @entity165 , of @entity166 , said a @entity163 study was now taking place to look at samples from people where members of the same family had experienced brain tumours			2
she said : ‘ we know the chances of being diagnosed with a brain tumour could be two to three times higher if a relative has already been diagnosed , but the factors that influence this are still unknown			2
’ the family is now fundraising to help provide replacement games and toys for the oncology ward at @entity111 and for the charity @entity184 , which helps children with cancer			0
