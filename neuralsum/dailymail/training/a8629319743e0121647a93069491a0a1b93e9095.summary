by @entity0 published : 18:31 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 29 september 2013 while the @entity1 were in the trenches fighting the @entity3 , the womenfolk of @entity5 were back home toiling to keep the country functioning			0
well , most of them were			0
others , it seems , spent the @entity12 down the pub , taking advantage of certain freedoms that came with the fact most of the nation ’s young men had been sent away to the front line			1
moral outrage was sparked by an ‘ army of women ’ filling @entity5 ’s public houses , leading to demands for @entity26 action to keep them at home			2
' the army of women crowding public - houses ' : the @entity32 reports the hoards of women who took to drinking in pubs during @entity12 by trawling local newspaper archives , the family history website @entity37 found the problem cropping up all over the country , as indignation spread at the sight of women carousing in alehouses			1
some were even compared to prostitutes as newspapers reported calls for ‘ drastic ’ action			0
men who stayed in @entity5 and worked long hours found pubs had even run out of supplies by the time the ladies had finished at the bar			1
one disgruntled worker wrote to the @entity56 in february 1918 about the ‘ army of women crowding the public houses ’			2
he complained : ‘ the amount of liquor drunk by women on licensed premises is abnormal , and it is a fact that men returning from work at 9pm are often unable to obtain any refreshment			1
’ he suggested landlords should keep aside ‘ a small surplus of supplies for their male customers who are “ doing their bit ” working late at night ’			0
similar grievances were aired in @entity74 , while in @entity76 there were calls for the sheriff to take action to ‘ lessen the evil ’			0
' an excessive amount of drinking ' was reported in @entity76 , prompting the sheriff to take action against the situation which ' demanded drastic treatment ' having control of money seems to have enabled women to socialise more			1
in 1914 , the @entity90 reported : ‘ having more money than usual , there were only too many [ people ] ready to help them to spend it in the wrong way			2
’ in 1916 , the matter was debated by @entity97 , one of whom , captain @entity98 , said : ‘ the great increase in the number of women visiting public - houses during the past year has demanded drastic treatment			0
’ the licensing magistrates proposed refurbishing all public houses , to do away with ‘ partitions , snugs and other obstacles likely to facilitate secret drinking ’			0
in 1915 , the @entity32 reported a member of the county magistrates , mr @entity109 , had been shocked to count ‘ 26 women enter a licensed house in ten minutes , with 16 coming out who he had not seen enter ’			0
the @entity115 found that the women ' were given to excess before ' , reports the @entity32 , while a female writer tries to explain the ' toiling ' of women in the working classes in another newspaper article he likened this behaviour to that of a prostitute , remarking : ‘ some people said women have a right to spend their money as they liked ; they might as well say they had a right to sell themselves if they like			1
’ @entity133 , of @entity37			0
said : ' despite the negative press , women continued to enjoy themselves in the pubs			1
‘ these were stressful times but the war also gave women more freedoms , because a lot of the men were away and they had greater control over the family finances			2
' our researchers found that all over @entity5 there were concerns about the amount of women drinking in pubs			1

newspaper archives show growing concern over *soldiers* ' wives who took over pubs during @entity12
it was *thought* the women took to drinking more as they had more freedom over household money
there was sometimes no *alcohol* left for men leaving work in the pubs where women would pass time
