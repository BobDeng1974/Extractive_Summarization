@entity0 went back to work on friday at @entity3 ’s @entity2 , alma mater of 10 @entity5 prime ministers and one of the country ’s great schools , but there was no way they could relax and enjoy the splendour of their surroundings			1
elimination at the group stages of this @entity16 is just one slip - up or even one rainy day away for @entity0 , who seem to have been wading through treacle while the rest of the world have been playing a different , far more vibrant , one - day game			1
now @entity0 must beat @entity23 and @entity24 in their final group a games and hope @entity26 also defeat @entity23 , while keeping their fingers crossed that the elements do not intervene			1
@entity29 has warned @entity0 that they can not afford any more slip - ups if they are to avoid elimination @entity29 catches the ball during an @entity0 nets session at @entity2 in @entity3 @entity29 plays a shot during an @entity0 nets session as they prepare for the game against @entity24 @entity36 sealed a place in the @entity16 knockout stages after a nervy run chase against @entity40 in @entity41			1
the defending champions bowled @entity40 out for 182 in 44.2 overs , captain @entity44 top - scoring with 57 at @entity45			0
@entity36 ’s task was made harder by an up - and - down wicket at the @entity48 , but 45 not out from @entity49 saw them reach their target with four wickets and 10.5 overs to spare			2
‘ it was a difficult wicket , with variable bounce , ’ said @entity49			0
‘ overall , i was very happy with the performance			0
’ @entity0 have endured some rotten @entity57 but to go out in the first round of a competition designed to guarantee progress for the big eight would make this the worst yet			2
but the way they have been playing , not even victory against the two minnows can be taken for granted			0
defeat by @entity23 at the @entity66 on monday would pile pressure on coach @entity68 and @entity69 , who appointed him , when a new broom is sweeping through the @entity71			2
to think that the @entity72 were moved and we had to endure a 5 - 0 thrashing so that this team could have unprecedented one - day preparation for a @entity16			2
there was a subdued air on friday with only the @entity80 ’s pupils chosen to supplement the fielders during middle practice having a spring in their step			2
@entity0 were criticised for changing their line - up on the eve of this @entity16 but they would be stubborn in the extreme if they did not shuffle their pack now			1
trouble is , @entity90 looked in terrible touch both in the middle against @entity0 ’s bowlers and later in a net			1
@entity36 sealed a place in the @entity16 knockout stages after a nervy run chase against @entity40 in @entity41 @entity0 coach @entity68 talks to the players during an @entity0 nets session at @entity2 , @entity3 meanwhile , @entity101 cut a forlorn figure as he faced some of the worst net bowling imaginable from the enthusiastic locals and @entity0 can only hope that both contenders for @entity108 ’s place fare much better in practice over the weekend			1
at least @entity110 looked terrific when he batted			0
‘ it ’s not the greatest , ’ admitted @entity29 when asked how the mood was			0
‘ but we are determined to change that round			0
in simple terms we have to play much better to get to the quarter - finals			0
we have to play well and win two games of cricket			0
’ @entity29 is one of the few players capable of making the sort of impact we have seen from @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 but he has been held back by a far too conservative @entity0			1
@entity110 plays a shot during an @entity0 nets session at @entity2 on friday afternoon @entity110 plays a shot as @entity130 wicket - keeper @entity129 looks on during @entity131 the fact that he received only 19 balls against @entity134 in @entity135 perhaps said it all and the new one - day vice-captain accepted that @entity0 need to have a look at a batting order that seems to have been set in stone			1
‘ i think we have to be flexible to different situations , ’ said @entity29			0
‘ if we get off to a good start then maybe guys could go up the order and look to take it on a bit more			0
whatever we do we have to post big scores and do it consistently			0
’ @entity0 ’s bowlers are under just as much pressure as the batsmen after the way @entity134 cruised home in @entity135 and it would be no surprise if @entity155 , who had a long bowl on friday , comes in against @entity23			1

@entity0 went back to training at @entity3 ’s @entity2 on friday
they must beat @entity23 and @entity24 in their final @entity164 games
while keeping their fingers crossed that the elements do not intervene
otherwise @entity0 face an *embarrassing* @entity16 group stage exit
