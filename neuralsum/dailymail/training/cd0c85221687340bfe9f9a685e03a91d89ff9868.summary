there is no escaping the irony			0
just days after a @entity4 semi-final took place in front of 56,058 empty seats at @entity8 , fans are in up - roar about a dearth of tickets for the @entity12			1
followers of @entity14 and @entity15 have launched a petition to have the secondary @entity18 final switched from @entity19 to a larger venue			1
their anger is understandable , as official allocations of 1,000 tickets to each of the @entity27 clubs have been rapidly sold out			0
@entity28 has to be smarter and more flexible in these tricky situations , to present its best face to the world			0
saracens v @entity33 should have been staged at the @entity34 or stadium : mk , in order to make a crowd of 25,942 represent a glorious spectacle			0
@entity40 ’s victors deserved better than to claim their finest @entity18 win in front of a two - thirds empty arena			1
no show : saracens remarkable 46 - 6 @entity4 semi-final win over @entity33 was watched by 25,942 fans electric : the fans in the cavernous stadium did their best , but a smaller venue would have done them justice dominant : @entity53 @entity52 celebrates one of his tries in front of 50,058 empty seats tournament organisers are at the mercy of results , hence the need for contingency planning , especially in the @entity63			1
if two @entity66 sides were contesting the final in the @entity69 capital , a capacity of 12,125 would be ample , but two of @entity27 ’s best - supported clubs can bring hordes across the border , so @entity74 should have been lined up as a stand - by option			2
surely there is insurance to cover such a scenario			0
the sport is on a multi-speed development curve			0
some teams now draw vast armies in their wake , while others make do with modest platoons			0
@entity87 lie top of the man - power table , so much so that a loud cluster of their fans detoured to @entity8 en route to @entity92			2
their commitment and fervour is phenomenal			0
travelling support is a useful gauge of the game ’s appeal			2
@entity101 sides are at the forefront with @entity103 and @entity104 , in that order , matching @entity87 ’s red hordes for fanaticism if not for numbers			0
in @entity27 , @entity109 are no 1 , followed by @entity15 , @entity14 and @entity110			1
minimal support : just 1000 fans from each club will see @entity14 play @entity15 in the @entity115 final more must be done to encourage weekly migrations			1
sensible kick - off times are essential			1
why the trend for 5pm starts ? @entity53 may charter trains to ferry their fans home from @entity19 after a late finish to the @entity4 final on may 24			1
clubs need to encourage away - days ; as @entity125 are doing by switching from friday night matches to saturday afternoons			1
paying spectators whose allegiance takes them on distant trips want the game to be part of a day out or weekend break , so they must be accommodated			0
@entity28 is not football ; it needs to work harder to earn its popularity			0
the blizzard of tributes for @entity139 ’s destructive master - class for @entity53 at @entity8 last saturday came as due recognition for a ferocious competitor			1
his defensive onslaught was a herculean effort by anyone ’s standards , but certainly for a player whose career was nearly ended by a knee condition which still requires constant management			0
@entity139 ’s refusal to be beaten by injury strikes a chord , as do his feats as an elite performer from a second - tier rugby nation			1
the @entity157 flanker is savouring most of his career highlights in club colours , but next year ’s @entity161 may provide a fitting @entity163 peak			1
tributes : @entity139 's effort in the @entity4 semi-final was worthy of the praises he 's received top level : after a @entity171 final , the @entity157 star could line - up at the @entity161 against the @entity172 if @entity157 qualify for the tournament as ‘ @entity175 ’ from a four - team play - off in @entity177 this summer , the prize would be a place in @entity179 and a showdown with the @entity172 at the @entity181 in @entity182			1
while the result would be a foregone conclusion , @entity139 would certainly make the world champions know they had been in a battle			2
on the subject of recognition , there should be more for the man in charge of @entity14 ’s charge into title contention this season			2
the @entity195 finished seventh in the @entity197 last season , but under @entity198 they have soared to third place in this campaign , while also shifting away from a territorial approach to a more all - singing , all - dancing attacking game			1
yet , the @entity204 defence coach has not been included in the shortlist for the @entity207 award , which features @entity209 ( @entity109 ) , @entity210 ( @entity125 ) and @entity40 ( @entity53 )			1
unsung : @entity14 director of rugby @entity198 should be recognised for his work with the club this season @entity198 and his opposite number at @entity217 on friday night , @entity15 ’s @entity215 , can feel hard done by			1
the clash between their teams will go a long way to shaping the play - off equation and @entity14 are without @entity223 , who has been rested , while the @entity224 have left out @entity227 wing @entity225 , who has been struggling to recover from a calf injury			1
@entity28 ’s officiating crisis goes on			0
the authorities have opened two cans of worms ; the first involving the crack - down on dangerous ‘ tip tackles ’			1
in the @entity4 quarter - finals , @entity236 of @entity103 was sent off for taking @entity53 ’ @entity238 out in the air , but last friday @entity15 wing @entity240 was shown a yellow card for the same offence , after bringing down @entity244			1
inconsistent : @entity103 's @entity236 was sent off but @entity224 ' @entity240 got a yellow for the same offence contact was minimal , but the incident provided further proof that referees are ruling based on the severity of the damage caused , rather than meeting the demands for uniformity from on - high			2
the zero tolerance stance has created chaos			0
secondly , increased use of @entity257 has become a farce , with referees pre-empting their verdict by watching big screens in stadiums , or being damned if they do n’t refer every marginal call ‘ upstairs ’			2
last sunday , @entity264 and his assistant , @entity265 , correctly ruled that @entity266 had touched down for @entity87 , but they were berated in some quarters for not confirming by video			0
but they were right ; the @entity257 is there to help in the event of on - field doubt			2
more common - sense is needed			0
@entity28 is in expansion mode again , with an announcement on thursday that the 15 - team tournament will be replaced by a rejigged 18 - team structure from 2016			0
the ‘ @entity280 ’ group will feature the current five sides from @entity282 and five from @entity172 , while the @entity279 will feature a sixth franchise from that country , plus one from @entity285 and another			2
branching out : last season 's @entity28 champions the @entity286 will soon be in a 18 - team competition the inclusion of an @entity292 team , despite the logistical challenges that creates , is a welcome move with the bigger global picture in mind , but the selection of the 18th team is likely to be a commercial exercise			2
the @entity301 consensus is that this side should come from the ‘ asian market ’ - with profit apparently the prime consideration			0
what there should be instead is a pacific islands team , perhaps based outside @entity309 and supported by @entity311 funding			0
why not really go for broke with an islands team and a franchise based in , say , @entity314 , as part of the @entity280 group , and another @entity317 side in a new location – possibly @entity319 ? pipe dreams …			0

@entity14 and @entity15 fans have launched a petition in *protest* of their small ticket allocation for the @entity12 up final in @entity19
if rugby *administrators* do *n't* take the hint fans will vote with their feet
travelling fans should be encouraged , starting with sensible kick - off times
the chorus of praise for @entity53 ' @entity139 is well - deserved and a @entity161 clash with the @entity172 for @entity157 could be a worth *reward*
@entity14 director of rugby @entity198 , along with @entity15 's @entity215 , should feel hard done by after being *overlooked* for end - of - season honours
@entity207 *nominees* are @entity209 ( @entity109 ) , @entity210 ( @entity125 ) and @entity40 ( @entity53 )
the *crackdown* on ' tip - tackles ' has opened a can of worms
the use of @entity257 has become a farce
