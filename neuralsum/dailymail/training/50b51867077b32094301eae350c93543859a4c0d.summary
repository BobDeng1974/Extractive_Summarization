could this spell the end of unsightly underarm sweat patches ? a better relationship between your new carpet and your dinner parties ? for messy chefs in @entity9 kitchens at least , the latest in ' intelligent ' fabrics could mean a much lighter wash load			0
an @entity9 start - up company has created ' hydrophobic ' chef jackets and aprons that repel almost any liquid , including red wine and oil			1
not even sweat will stick			0
off a duck 's back : the new ' hydrophobic ' chef jackets repels water , wine and oil			1
' as a chef i find it really difficult to keep my chef jacket white , and we like our jackets white for obvious professional reasons , ' says @entity30 , previous @entity31 mentor and co-founder of @entity33			1
' there 's nothing currently on the market which helps this apart from buying new jackets and washing them every day			2
so we decided to create a new range of chef jackets using nanotechnology that makes it water repellent and stain - proof			2
' @entity33 says its garments are not made with sprays which often contain carcinogenic chemicals			2
the hydrophobic properties are locked into the weave of the fabric			0
former @entity31 mentor and @entity33 co-founder says chefs spend too much money and time on garments that do n't last no stain , no pain : nanotechnology means not even red wine or tomato sauce will leave a mark on your hydrophonic shirts the nanotechnology works by modifying the fabric molecules ; attaching hydrophobic ‘ whiskers ’ to the fibres which makes liquids bead - up and roll off the fabric @entity68 liquid that is repelled carries particles of dirt off with it , making it essentially self - cleaning			1
@entity33 has set up a @entity76 fund to launch its products and says it hopes to move towards making similar stain - free garments for the medical industry in the future , including , medical garbs , nurses uniforms and lab coats			2
the chef 's jackets currently sell for $ 90 and the aprons from $ 30			1
self - cleaning : water rolls off the surface of the hydrophobic fabric , carrying any dirt along with it @entity33 's chef whites are just the latest in intelligent nanotechnology fabric design in @entity9			1
last month , @entity95 clothing label @entity94 patented a 100 % cotton waterproof t - shirt with similar technology			0
it too , was created without the use of harmful chemicals seen in many hydrophobic sprays in the @entity101 ' the @entity103 shirt contains no aerosol applications and no dangerous chemicals , and is completely safe to wear - as a shirt should be , ' says @entity108 's @entity107			0
' most people are pretty amazed when they see it			0
' and just like @entity33 , @entity108 draws its inspiration from nature			0
the unsoak - able tees , says the company , ' emulate the natural hydrophobic properties of the lotus leaf			0
' @entity33 's stain - proof chef 's jacket is made with environmentally - friendly nanotechnology to deflect liquids			1

former @entity31 mentor @entity30 creates ' *smart* ' chef 's jackets and aprons with nanotechnology
the lotus *effect* : liquids roll off the fabric , carrying dirt and oil along with it
garments contain no carcinogens and are longer lasting than *traditional* chef uniforms
