when it comes to leaders on the pitch @entity3 coach @entity2 knows he is blessed			1
leading out the @entity5 chasers against @entity6 in the @entity7 in @entity8 on saturday will be talisman @entity9 , the giant lock who will be earning his 100th international cap			1
@entity9 has captained @entity3 in all but two of the 16 tests since @entity2 took charge but his style of leadership means other players are given their head when it comes to making decisions in the heat of battle			1
@entity3 fly half @entity22 has been in superb form for his country this season @entity3 captain @entity9 is set to win his 100th cap against @entity6 in @entity8 @entity22 works on his ball skills as head coach @entity2 ( right ) watches on at the @entity28 ' one of the other things is that @entity9 does n't assume every leadership responsibility , he delegates and he encourages and so that is one of the fantastic things for the coaches as well , ' @entity2 told the @entity36			1
' it means @entity38 ( @entity39 ) has a definite role			0
he has some particular things that he leads on , that @entity22 does , that @entity44 does , @entity43 , we have got a number of provincial leaders , @entity47 , who step up and take different roles of leadership			0
' so i think of the best things about @entity9 is that he does n't try to carry the whole weight of leadership on his own shoulders			2
' @entity9 will pack down with @entity56 lock @entity55 in the engine room the @entity59 pack ' he is incredibly driven to improve his own performance and thereby leads others in doing that			2
' fly - half @entity22 , who will win his 50th cap against @entity6 , said @entity9 's very presence , both on and off the field , is an inspiration			1
' he 's an outstanding leader , ' @entity22 said			2
' when he speaks to the squad during the week the hairs on the back of your neck stand up			0
' he know how important his words are			0
' @entity22 's predecessor and long - time team mate of @entity9 , @entity75 added : ' @entity9 is very , very special in terms of the ability to deliver the right message at the right time			2
' that quality will be especially handy in the red - hot cauldron of the @entity28 where @entity6 , after their opening loss to @entity86 , have put themselves back in contention for the title			1
@entity89 would leave the grand slam tantalisingly close with an away match against struggling @entity92 to finish			0
' it 's a massive game for a whole lot of reasons			0
an opportunity to do what no @entity59 team has ever done in the history of the game , ' @entity2 said .			0
