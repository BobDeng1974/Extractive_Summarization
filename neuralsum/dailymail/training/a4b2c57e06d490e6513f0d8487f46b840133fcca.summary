strictly favourite : @entity0 has been mad about dance she was at school and trained for three years at a top dance school anyone watching this year ’s @entity5 will be familiar with contestant @entity0 ’s post-dance routine			1
after leaving the floor on the arm of hunky dance partner @entity9 , she ’ll often put a hand up to her face to hide her emotions , occasionally even shedding a photogenic tear of relief that they have danced so well			1
of course , anyone learning to dance in the very public spotlight of @entity5 would be forgiven for being relieved that a routine had gone well			1
but should tv presenter @entity0 really be so surprised that she ’s pulled off yet another brilliant , high - octane performance ? or might her reaction be somewhat disingenuous ? for , with the 35 - year - old tipped to lift the famous glitterball trophy in the series finale tonight , the @entity22 can reveal for the first time that @entity0 is actually a professionally trained dancer			1
she spent three years studying the discipline at the @entity27 in @entity28 , emerging with a musical theatre qualification at the age of 20			1
while other contestants such as @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 have come under fire for having gone to stage school for years or danced in bands , thereby seemingly gaining an advantage in the competition , @entity0 ’s managed to keep her previous experience mostly under the radar , citing only a ‘ performing arts course ’			1
she even played down her time on @entity43 ’s @entity44 — where she was coached by @entity5 professional @entity45 to dance with a wheelchair - bound partner — describing it as more of a ‘ documentary ’ than a contest			1
but our investigation has discovered that , in fact , @entity0 has been mad about dance since she was at school , where she took ballet lessons , performed in shows and later joined a dance troupe			1
and although you will struggle to find mention of it in the numerous interviews she has done since starting the show , she pursued this after school and is remembered as the cream of the crop of those in her year at @entity65			1
the school ’s staff also appear to not want to talk about it : they turned down our request for an interview this week			2
but @entity71 , 48 , whose 30 - year - old son @entity73 ’s time at @entity65 crossed over with @entity0 ’s , told us : ‘ she was a great dancer even back then			1
‘ she did loads of dance , jazz , the lot			2
she did a degree and i watched the show for her leaving graduation			0
i would say she was probably the best in the class , she was really talented			0
’ one poster to an internet message board observed : ‘ my wife ( an ex-professional dancer ) and i were looking at the images of who is in the line - up for @entity92 and she was surprised to see @entity0			1
the reason is that @entity0 used to be two years below her when my wife studied dancing at the @entity27 where she ( @entity0 ) earned the nickname of “ @entity97 ”			1
‘ so , they get a load of “ celebs ” on , many of whom have never danced , and expect them to compete against a trained professional			2
’ the @entity43 this week admitted that @entity0 had trained in dance but offered no comment on the issue			1
@entity119 has her odds at 6 - 4 to win and she ’s still the only contestant who has managed the perfect score of 40 in the entire series			2
indeed , @entity0 has admitted she ’s hoping that @entity5 will lead to a string of roles on the @entity127 stage			1
in an interview last week she said : ‘ i ’ve found i really enjoy this kind of thing , so maybe i could do something like a musical			2
‘ that was what i wanted to do when i was younger and now i ’m thinking , “ maybe i could tread the boards			0
” ’ after leaving @entity136 , @entity137 — as she ’s known on @entity5 — unsuccessfully auditioned for roles in several @entity127 musicals , including @entity140 and @entity141			2
a career in tv presenting , which had never been her plan , followed instead			0
the presenter has also been linked to comedian @entity145 ( left ) and her fellow @entity148 presenter @entity146 ( right ) her big break came in 2002 , when she was cast as an actress in the sketch show @entity151 ! then began to present the @entity152			1
a spell on the @entity43 children ’s show @entity156 followed before she replaced @entity157 as the host of @entity160 ’s @entity159 , then progressed to presenting spin - off shows for @entity162 and i ’m a celebrity			2
@entity164 ! perhaps unsurprisingly , during this period she admits to being ‘ wild ’			0
she was often found to be propping up the bar of the notorious @entity167 pub in @entity168 , @entity169 , with her drug - addict friends @entity171 and @entity172			2
‘ i ’ve turned up for work still drunk , ’ she ’s admitted			0
her chequered love life could also have been termed ‘ wild ’			0
indeed , it ’s been so busy that it reads rather like a @entity178 of the tv entertainment world			0
in 2011 , she was at the centre of a media storm when she started dating @entity113 ’s @entity112 , then 17 years old to her 32			1
naturally , the band ’s fans were appalled			0
‘ shame on you ! ’ cried one			0
‘ does he call you @entity186 ? ’ asked another			0
the backlash was vicious enough for her to seek therapy after the three - month fling ran its course			2
@entity0 seems to collect interesting young men in the way that schoolboys once acquired stamps			2
before @entity112 , there was prince @entity110 — whom she reputedly nicknamed ‘ jam ’ because he was red ( headed ) and sweet			1
they went on numerous dates in 2009 , after being introduced by a mutual friend while he was on a break from @entity201 , and she even stayed over one night at @entity202			0
@entity0 has since insisted nothing happened — instead she and @entity110 , who is five years her junior , were ‘ consoling ’ each other over broken romances			1
@entity119 has @entity0 ( pictured left with her dance partner @entity9 and right during @entity5 ) at odds at 6 - 4 to win she is still the only contestant who has managed the perfect score of 40 in the entire series ‘ he ’s a friend and i regard our friendship highly , ’ she said			1
then there was @entity216 , who was apparently bowled over by her flirtatious nature and long legs back in 2008			0
again , she insists there was no romance , although it appears he was — fruitlessly — quite smitten for a time			0
as was @entity222 , her co-presenter on the i ’m a celebrity spin - off , @entity224 ! ‘ i do n’t think anything happened with her and @entity222 , but she has quite an effect on men , ’ said a co-worker on the show			0
@entity0 hopes her @entity5 success will lead her to the @entity127 there was also talk that pop star @entity146 , her co-host on @entity162 ’s @entity235 spin - off @entity148 , was similarly smitten			1
and comedian @entity145 was spotted in a series of clinches with ‘ @entity238 ’ in a dark corner of a @entity168 pub not long after the @entity110 affair			1
that ’s not to forget her three - year ‘ on / off ’ romance with drummer @entity244 ( real name @entity246 ) of the @entity248			1
a hook - up with comedian @entity250 is , however , denied , as are rumours of liaisons with @entity253 and @entity254			1
yet @entity0 ’s most serious relationship has been her latest			2
indeed , she was so convinced music manager @entity256 — 26 to her 35 — was ‘ @entity258 ’ , she texted him after their first date 18 months ago referring to herself as ‘ @entity262 ’			0
but the pair , who had been living together at her @entity169 flat , recently broke up , breaking her heart			0
rumours abound that @entity262 , who manages rising pop star @entity269 , may have had a wandering eye			0
her publicist insists that the split was mutual and amicable			0
whatever the truth , her distress is evident			0
when he reminded fans on @entity278 last weekend to : ‘ vote for @ carolineflack1			0
you ’d be silly not too [ sic ] , ’ she snapped back : ‘ easing your guilt ? ? ? fill yourself with glee jack			0
’ she quickly deleted the tweet and replaced it with : ‘ it ’s not bad to be sad			0
’ ever the professional , she ’s been hiding her distress on @entity5			2
let ’s hope that if she lifts that glitterball trophy tonight , she may finally get over her broken heart .			0
