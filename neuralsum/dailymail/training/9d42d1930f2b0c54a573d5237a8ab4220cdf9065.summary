by @entity0 one of the secrets of creating new life has been discovered by scientists – bringing hope of better treatment for childless women			0
@entity8 researchers have shown that the egg ’s surface is studded with a protein that is essential for fertility			1
christened @entity14 , after the @entity16 goddess of marriage and fertility , it ‘ mates ’ with a partner protein on sperm , at the moment of conception			1
hope : @entity8 researchers have discovered a protein on the surface of a woman 's egg that is essential for fertility			1
called @entity14 , it ' mates ' with a partner protein on sperm , at the moment of conception without @entity14 , the sperm and egg can not fuse to create new life			1
researcher @entity35 , of the @entity36 near @entity37 , said : ‘ we have solved a long - standing mystery in biology by identifying the molecules displayed on all sperm and egg that must bind each other at the moment we were conceived			2
‘ without this essential interaction , fertilisation just can not happen			0
we may be able to use this discovery to improve fertility treatments and develop new contraceptives			1
’ since 2005 , when an essential protein was found sitting on head of sperm , the search has been on for its female counterpart			2
the @entity36 team created an artificial version of the sperm protein and the used it to hunt out its egg version			2
moving forward : scientists now hope the discovery of the new protein could help improve fertility treatments such as @entity64 on finding @entity14 , they did a series of tests that proved it to be necessary for fertilisation			1
importantly , mice that were unable to make @entity14 seemed perfectly healthy but were infertile			2
although they made eggs , sperm were unable to bind to them , the journal @entity71 reports			0
the experiments also revealed that @entity14 is quickly removed from the surface of an egg after fertilisation occurs			1
protection : the protein may also play a role in developing contraceptives of the future this ensures only sperm binds with the egg and increases the odds of a successful pregnancy			2
it is thought that a similar protein is found on women ’s eggs – and that flaws in it could explain why some couples ca n’t have children			0
if this is the case , women found to have a faulty @entity14 protein could be treated with @entity101 , a special type of @entity64 , in which the sperm is injected directly into the egg			1
this would bypass the flawed @entity14 protein on the surface and could allow them to achieve their dream of motherhood			1
researcher dr @entity110 said : ‘ infertility is becoming an increasing problem , especially in @entity114 countries , and it is remarkable that 20 per cent of infertility cases have an unexplained cause			0
‘ we are now testing whether @entity14 is involved in these cases			0
’ dr @entity120 , a @entity121 fertility expert , said : ‘ the identification of the @entity14 protein opens up many exciting prospects			1
‘ perhaps the most obvious biomedical application of this finding is whether screening for this protein could be used as a test of fertility			0
’ however , he questioned how many couples would benefit			0
the discovery could also lead to new contraceptives			0
as they would n’t be based on hormones , they should be free of the mood - swings , acne and other unwelcome side - effects of existing drugs			0
contraceptive jabs could also be used to control badgers , deer and other populations , rather than resorting to culling .			0
