by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 12:11 est , 21 march 2013 laid back : pope @entity1 will hold the papal holy thursday service in @entity4 , a youth jail on the outskirts of @entity6 , where he will wash the feet of 12 inmates after only a week at the helm of the @entity10 , he has already earned himself the nickname the @entity12 's @entity1 due to his candid nature and willingness to break from tradition			1
but even the most ardent reformers within the church will raise an eyebrow at @entity1 's latest proposal , as the @entity20 announced that he will hold next week 's @entity22 service in a youth prison			1
during the service at the @entity4 jail , situated on the outskirts of @entity6 , the @entity25 pontiff is expected to wash and kiss the feet 12 prisoners			1
the 76 - year - old 's gesture reflects that of @entity30 on the night of the @entity31 , when he washed the feet of his disciples			2
the ceremony carries added poignancy , given that it will be the first @entity22 service held outside either @entity37 or the basilica of @entity39 in @entity40			1
since being elected to head the church following pope @entity43 's historic decision to step down , @entity1 has surprised senior @entity20 officials by staging spontaneous walkabouts			1
he also prompted a receptionist to exclaim ' if you 're the @entity1 , i 'm @entity50 ' during conversation when he called a @entity53 residence in @entity6 only to be put through to the switchboard			1
but his decision to break with tradition for next week 's service will surprise nobody in his native @entity25 , where he washed the feet of @entity61 sufferers and met with sex workers			1
his predecessor @entity43 also washed the feet of lay people in his first two years in the @entity20 , but only performed the gesture on priests since 2008			1
people 's pope : @entity1 has established a reputation for being laid back due to his desire to break from tradition break from tradition : it will be the first @entity22 service held outside either @entity37 ( pictured ) or the basilica of @entity39 in @entity40 meeting : @entity1 , pictured meeting @entity76 chancellor @entity75 , will fly to have lunch with his predecessor @entity43 before the prison service @entity80 washed the feet of a group of homeless men in 1980 but the mass was held in the @entity86 's cathedral			1
for most of his tenure however , pope @entity80 only performed the gesture on members of the clergy			0
the @entity20 said that next week 's ceremony will be a continuation of his work as the archbishop of @entity95 , when he celebrated the holy day in shelters , hospitals and prisons			1
the ' context of simplicity ' has underpinned much of @entity1 's life in the church - he is known to take the bus , prefer smaller residences and wear old shoes			2
@entity1 's visit to the youth prison will be the its second papal visit			2
@entity43 travelled there in 2007 , although not during @entity110			0
individual : while archbishop of @entity95 he was known to take the bus , wear his old shoes and spend time with the disadvantaged before his visit , @entity1 will fly to @entity116 where @entity43 has been living since quitting the @entity20 for health reasons			2
the pair will have a lunch meeting , while both wearing papal white robes			0
it is still unsure where @entity1 will choose to live , as maintenance work is being carried out on the @entity124 , but @entity43 will move into an apartment within the @entity20 in a matter of weeks			2
pope @entity1 ' informal style got the better of him when he telephoned a @entity20 receptionist directly and was told : ' and i 'm @entity50			2
' the new pope , according to @entity132 religious website @entity130 , had announced himself when he called a @entity53 residence in @entity6 on friday and got through to the switchboard			0
he had been trying to contact @entity136 , the superior general of the @entity1 's old @entity53 order			0
but the baffled receptionist - identified only as @entity139 - thought someone was playing a trick on him and quipped back : ' oh yes ? and i 'm @entity50			0
' his holiness eventually got through , after managing to convince the receptionist he was genuine saying : ' i really am @entity1			0
' one @entity20 expert explained : ' you ca n't really blame the poor man			0
no other pope would have picked up a telephone to make their own calls			0
an official usually calls a secretary who places the call			0
' the receptionist is extremely distraught but i think the new pope has a good sense of humour and will laugh it off , ' they added .			0

@entity164 will travel to @entity4 jail on outskirts of @entity6 for the service
while @entity170 he washed feet of @entity61 sufferers
@entity1 has gained the nickname the @entity12 's @entity1 for laid back *approach*
it will also be the first papal holy thursday service held outside @entity20 and @entity86 's cathedral
