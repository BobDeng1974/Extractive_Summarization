immediately after finding the ship and recovering a fraction of its garden of gold , @entity32 became embroiled in a decades - long legal battle over who had rights to the treasure and how it was being dispersed			0

he has been a federal fugitive ever since			0
meanwhile , the @entity17 and its gold sat untouched since 1991 , the last time @entity32 and his team were at the site			1

included among passenger items recovered from the @entity17 are a safe that contained two cotton pieces of clothing wrapped tightly around gold coins , nuggets , and dust , a pouch with 134 gold double eagles , a leather saddlebag with more nuggets , and a small packet filled with paper and sealed with twine			1
other personal items include the photographs of at least 60 passengers , which were left at the bottom of the ocean until @entity64 can figure out how to safely recover them			0
the photos are known as ambrotypes , a short - lived type of photography that used glass plates			0
' photographs of any mid- 19th century @entity7 miners are rare , and these ambrotypes are the only examples found on any 19th - century shipwreck worldwide , ' according to a court report by @entity64			0
