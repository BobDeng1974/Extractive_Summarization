by @entity0 published : 20:07 est , 4 august 2012 updated : 07:11 est , 5 august 2012 terrified : the women , @entity2 , @entity3 , and @entity4 , speaking from their cell			2
caged behind the perspex panes of a cramped @entity10 courtroom cell , the three young @entity7 women huddle together in dejected and fearful silence as a stern - faced woman prison warden , a 3ft wooden truncheon strapped to her waist , stands guard			1
terrified , separated from their children and deprived of food , water and sleep for long stretches , the three members of @entity7 punks - against - @entity19 band @entity18 face seven years ’ imprisonment if convicted of the trumped - up charge of hooliganism levelled against them for staging an impromptu protest against president @entity19 in a @entity10 cathedral , an act which outraged the @entity7 leader			1
‘ it ’s torture , ’ whispers @entity33 as she glances anxiously towards the guard			2
‘ we do n’t sleep and we are not given any food			1
but @entity38 is with me and i wo n’t be scared by what a man can do to me			2
‘ i thought the church loved its children ... but it turns out it loves only the children who believe in @entity19			1
i thought the church ’s role was to call us to believe in @entity38 , not to tell us to believe in one certain president			2
’ the women ’s protest , during which they were dressed in colourful costumes and wore knitted balaclavas , has been labelled as sacrilege			2
during a one - minute performance they danced around the cathedral ’s altar , high - kicking , bowing , blessing themselves and chanting : ‘ @entity57 , drive @entity19 away			1
’ a video was posted on @entity59 two weeks before the presidential vote in march in which @entity19 won a third term , despite a wave of massive protests against his rule			1
when @entity66 , head of the @entity67 – who earlier had urged the congregation to vote for @entity19 – watched the video clip and contacted the president , the women were immediately arrested			1
though terrified by the prospect of a lengthy jail sentence , @entity3 remains defiantly determined that she has right on her side			1
she is genuinely sorry if she caused offence , she says			2
when she was refused bail and told she had to remain in jail to protect her from angry @entity79 believers , she was furious			2
‘ i do not need such protection , ’ she scoffs			2
‘ @entity82 does not protect me , it does n’t make me better , ’ she says sadly			0
‘ it just ruins me			0
on trial : three members of feminist punk group @entity18 , @entity86 , left , @entity4 , right and @entity87 , centre , are on trial for putting on an @entity91 performance in a @entity10 cathedral the trio waits in a defendant 's cage awaiting the beginning of their trial session at the khamovnichesky district court in @entity10 earlier today ‘ my life is like a pendulum swinging between the words nonsense and outrage			1
i spend my time reading letters and meeting my lawyer			0
and i ’m reading my letters of support			0
thanks to these , i can now quote the disciple @entity110 , who said , “ @entity38 is with me , and i wo n’t be scared about what a man can do to me			0
” ‘ and if @entity79 people are offended that we climbed on the altar and used it as a stage , then we ask them to forgive us			0
we just did n’t really know the church rules			0
‘ let me assure you that we do understand them now			0
‘ frankly , i consider the charges against me absurd because i live in a secular state and i am a citizen of a secular state			0
’ for more than five months now @entity3 , 24 , and her fellow band members @entity125 , 22 , and @entity4 , 29 , have languished in jail awaiting their trial , which began last week at @entity10 ’s @entity129 district court			1
after lengthy courtroom appearances each day , the women are rarely allowed to sleep for more than four hours at night and are frequently denied food and water for up to 12 hours while cooped up in their perspex cage			1
their only glimpses of daylight are during their daily drive to what is widely regarded as a @entity19 - orchestrated show trial			1
and , once inside their stuffy , airless cage , they are even denied access to the 3,000 pages of so - called evidence against them			1
last week , as @entity19 paid a fleeting visit to @entity148 to watch the @entity150 judo – while glad - handing @entity151 – he hinted that the judiciary should take a lenient view of the protest staged in @entity10 ’s @entity155			1
in reality , the trial could not be more crucial , coming at a pivotal point in @entity19 ’s increasingly brutal bid to crush the crumbling remains of his country ’s civil liberties			1
the cathedral protest which landed the three @entity7 punk girls in trouble with the country 's authorities slumped in a corner of her court - room cage , @entity2 , a fifth - year philosophy student who is married with a four - year - old daughter , @entity172 , says she does n’t believe she is guilty of anything more than voicing her opinions ; nor that the band ’s stunt in the cathedral , was hooliganism or designed to incite religious hatred and hostility towards the church			1
‘ i ’ve never performed , and i ’m not going to perform , any socially dangerous acts , ’ she insists			0
‘ and i do n’t consider what i have done is a crime			0
it is not worth keeping me here and making my child suffer			0
’ all she wants , she says , is to see an end to the authoritarian stranglehold @entity19 has on @entity7			1
‘ what we did was a desperate attempt to change the political system			0
we had no intention of insulting people			0
we never thought our punk appearance would cause offence			0
a @entity18 supporter is shouting slogans outside the court ahead of the trial			2
support for the women have been wide spread including @entity206 rockers @entity204 and @entity207 ‘ our mistake was bringing our political protest to a temple			0
we were just reacting to the patriarch calling upon the congregation to vote for @entity19 and his policies			1
’ @entity3 is equally convinced of her innocence			0
‘ the aim of our performance was to attract patriarch @entity66 ’s attention			2
‘ we are confused by his actions and his appeals to the congregation			0
what we want is dialogue			0
‘ he says that @entity79 believers must vote for @entity19			1
i am @entity79 but my political views are different			0
so what should i do ? ’ in the past days , the trio ’s plight has attracted the backing of several high - profile musicians			2
in a letter to a newspaper on friday , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 , among others , called on @entity19 to ensure that the trio ’s trial is fair			1
whether @entity19 intends to make examples of them or has , indeed , decided to be lenient , it is impossible to know			1
one thing , however , is assured : it will be , ultimately , the @entity7 president ’s decision			0
as @entity2 ’s husband @entity247 says : ‘ @entity19 is @entity7 ’s court			1
he will decide the verdict in the end			0

trio face seven years in jail after staging cathedral performance calling for @entity19 to be removed from power
denied food and water for 12 hours while cooped up in their perspex cage
rarely given more than four hours sleep a night
only daylight is on their drive to ' @entity19 show trial '
