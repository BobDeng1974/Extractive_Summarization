when coffee chain @entity1 opened the doors of its new shop in @entity5 , it must have thought its signs , translated into @entity7 , would endear the company to visitors			1
instead , it left them baffled			2
one slogan painted on the wall in white script read : ' nourishing the human spirit			0
one person , one cup and			0
' elsewhere , the company said of its products : ' light of body and taste our coffee to most easy to drink			0
' the outlet in @entity26 , above , the 21st in @entity24 , is the first to adopt @entity7 as its first language one customer , @entity28 , said : ' it 's a nice gesture , but they have got it really wrong			1
some of the translations are gobbledegook			0
' @entity1 has apologised for the spelling mistakes and nonsense grammar , but @entity7 campaign groups have saluted the coffee chain			1
their view is that they would rather see ' slack @entity7 than slick @entity39 ' — even if that means swallowing a load of spelling mistakes along with your cappuccino			0
the outlet in @entity45 – the 21st to open in @entity24 – is the first to adopt @entity7 as its first language , with menus , blackboards and even its walls seeing @entity7 take precedence over @entity51			1
@entity1 has apologised for the @entity7 spelling mistakes and nonsense grammar			2
above , file image last month , @entity54 , director communications , @entity56 , told @entity57 : ' despite checks on our @entity7 language signage , a couple of typos have been spotted , we 're going to correct these as soon as possible			1
' he added : ' we try to create a warm welcoming environment for everyone to enjoy and this works best when we reflect the local culture and language in our store designs			0
we are really proud of our first dual - language menu board in @entity7 and @entity51 in our @entity5 store			1
' a spokeswoman added that there are employees in the @entity1 team who speak @entity7 .			2

@entity1 shop in @entity5 is the 21st outlet to open in @entity24
