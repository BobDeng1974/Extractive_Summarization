by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 is set to clinch a season - long loan move to @entity5 this week after being deemed surplus to requirements at @entity8			1
the @entity9 is earning a staggering £ 100,000 - a - week at @entity10 and the club are keen to get the goalkeeper off the wage bill			1
@entity3 ’s salary is a problem for the @entity17 side but they are likely to reach a compromise for the 34 - year - old			2
on the move : @entity5 are set to sign @entity3 , but still need to agree a compromise on his wages pedigree : @entity3 played in all seven of @entity26 's @entity25 matches earlier this summer @entity3 signed for @entity8 in 2012 but has failed to settle in west @entity27			1
the @entity29 winner has been limited to just 24 appearances for @entity31 's - and @entity32 is currently @entity34 's first choice keeper			0
the former @entity36 keeper spent last season on loan at @entity39 in the @entity40 , for whom he played just seven matches			0
nevertheless , @entity3 was still selected for @entity26 's @entity25 squad and played in all seven of their matches			0
offloading @entity3 would prove an important step for @entity8 as their owner , @entity47 , is keen to cut the wage bill after the frivolities of his early tenure at the club			2
number one : @entity32 has usurped @entity3 as @entity8 's first choice goalkeeper budget : @entity34 admitted that to add to his squad he would need to cut costs			0

@entity3 set to join @entity5 on a season - long loan
@entity8 currently *paying* @entity9 keeper £ 100,000 - a - week
@entity5 can not *afford* the wages but the two clubs will compromise
