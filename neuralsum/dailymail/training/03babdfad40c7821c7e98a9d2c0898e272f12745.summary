the environmental charity ’s climate campaigner @entity87 said : ‘ a year after @entity14 ’s wettest winter ever , the chancellor ’s leaked flood defence plans simply do n’t hold water			1

‘ but these leaked plans show that mr @entity99 is n’t taking the threat of climate change seriously : having foolishly neglected defences over the last @entity103 , he ’s proposing to do the same over the next @entity90 must use his @entity104 to invest enough in flood defences to keep pace with global warming , and redouble efforts to wean the economy off flood - inducing fossil fuels			1

if it goes ahead , the scheme would involve a six - mile wall built around @entity148 , creating a lagoon in the @entity159 with turbines that can harness the incoming and outgoing tides to generate power 14 hours a day			0
the scheme would provide renewable power for 120,000 homes for 120 years , saving 236,000 tonnes of carbon a year and creating 1,850 construction jobs as well as 150 long - term jobs in operation and leisure facilities on the lagoon			0
