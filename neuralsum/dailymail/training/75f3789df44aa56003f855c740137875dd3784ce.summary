airline food as a whole does not have the best reputation as the most exciting nor delicious meal one eats while travelling			2
however that may be about to change thanks to a brand new menu being unveiled by @entity7 which features larger serving sizes and a wider range of options than ever			1
the best part is the exciting new meals are served in economy and come at no extra cost to passengers			1
with a 50 per cent increase in the size of main meals and a pick of three different choices - four if you log on to the q - eat service to pre-order - the airline has completely overhauled its on board meals			0
passengers will soon be able to choose from the likes of smokey barbecue beef with roasted sweet potato , broccoli and corn or honey roasted chicken farro salad and seasonal vegetables with pumpkin and sesame seeds			1
scrambled eggs with chicken sausage , tomato , hash brown and baked beans and @entity46 and @entity49 's traditional @entity48 yoghurt with granola will also feature on the new menus set to take - off from november 25th			2
@entity7 chief executive officer @entity52 said he hopes the dining experience will raise the bar for the five million economy customers travelling across the airline 's international network each year			0
the meals are now double the size they used to be and passengers can choose from four options instead of two people are encouraged to choose their meal online before they fly so they receive their first preference ' we have worked closely with @entity67 's leading producers and suppliers to deliver what we believe to be the best inflight economy dining experience offered by any international carrier , ' said mr @entity52			1
' the new menu offers more generous meals and an increase from two to four meal options			1
we also have new meal categories , including a healthy option , comfort food , and a meal inspired by the route itself , like @entity82 on our @entity84 flights , ' said mr @entity52			0
' together with new serving plates , which remove the need for trays , our crew will be able to serve and clear meals up to 30 minutes faster giving them more time to interact and assist passengers , ' he added			2
the new serving plates remove the need for the large food trays and reduce unnecessary plastic waste meals are now much larger but also 40 per cent more expensive to produce than previous economy options passengers in economy also get the choice of a new range of snacks on board including pulled beef sliders with capsicum and tomato relish , @entity106 ice - cream bars , @entity107 and fresh fruit			1
the new experience has been introduced in a bid to improve customer satisfaction and while it wont be quite the standard of premium economy , the gap between that and economy will close slightly			0
and despite the larger meals now costing 40 percent more to produce - according to @entity117 - the airline is certain it has cut back costs on packaging - doing away with trays and unnecessary plastic wrappings			0
@entity7 ceo @entity52 said he hopes the dining experience will raise the bar for the five million economy customers travelling with the airline each year			0

the new menu will feature four meal options instead of the previous two
wagyu beef and a chicken salad will be among the first meals offered
passengers can also choose from snacks like beef sliders or @entity106 bars
