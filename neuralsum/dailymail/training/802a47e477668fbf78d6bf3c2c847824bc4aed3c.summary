an insider told @entity26 : ‘ @entity0 is annoyed about the whole debacle , ' and revealed how the singer thought it was ‘ stupid and reckless ’ of the pair to film their actions on camera			1
does it mean that some members of the boy band ca n't stand each other ? the source also revealed how , despite his reputation , @entity0 , 20 , is in fact ‘ professional and mature ’ and does not approve of such antics which he fears could now overshadow the band 's success			1
‘ this should be one of the biggest weeks of the band ’s career with the launch of their @entity75 stadium tour			2
instead it has been taken over by this controversy , ' the insider added			2
it comes as louis ’ father said he was ‘ worried ’ for his son after watching the footage - which was filmed on april 27 as the pair were escorted by car to a show at the @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity16 , where they performed to a 40,000 - strong crowd			1
@entity90 , 45 , said his son – who is a keen footballer who once made an appearance for @entity92 – had previously vowed to never touch drugs or get a tattoo			2
speaking to the @entity95 , he said : ‘ it seems the fame and money have changed him			0
he ’s a different person to that person three years ago			0
‘ i do believe that being that famous will be taking its toll on them			0
they need a serious talking to			2
’ ' joint lit. @entity106 ! ' @entity4 and @entity2 smoked a ' roll up cigarette ' and joke about marijuana in a video taken in @entity87 , @entity16 , last month hit maker : @entity4 takes a draw on the roll up			1
before they began their journey someone can be heard asking : ' are we allowed to talk contraband in this ?

he then says : ‘ it ’s green only , nig			0
’ he also questioned @entity1 ’s management – which includes their ultimate boss @entity137 – by saying they ‘ should be protecting ’ the boys from ‘ things like this ’			0
@entity137 has been dragged into the row by fans who have bombarded him with messages urging him to take action			0
as well as apparently smoking a ‘ joint ’ in the video , @entity80 has also been lambasted by fans and critics for using the word ' nig ' - which fans say is a shortened version of the n - word			1
in the video , @entity80 puts on an accent while speaking about drugs , then says : ‘ it ’s green only , nig			1
’ one direction fans - as well as mps and racism campaigners – have demanded apologies from the band in light of the video			2

@entity0 arrived at @entity167 on a separate private jet to @entity80 and @entity4 ahead of @entity1 's performance in @entity19 yesterday @entity171 ( left ) and @entity172 ( right ) arrived into @entity173 on the same £ 18million private jet as bandmate @entity0 but the other members of the group , scandal - hit louis and @entity4 , boarded a different jet but as the band played to a sell - out 52,000 - strong crowd at @entity181 ’s @entity183 ground last night , there was no mention of the recent controversy - let alone an apology			1
the only reference made to the scandal was by @entity171 , who joked about his skinny jeans then , in response to something shouted by a member of the crowd , added : ‘ no more media attention , please			0
’ it is not known how the other bandmates - @entity197 and @entity172 , both 20 - feel about @entity80 and @entity4 ’s video but it is thought the scandal could create a divide in the band			1
it is understood @entity0 and @entity172 already take separate ‘ non-smoking ’ private jets to the other members and last night the pair , joined by @entity197 , flew into @entity173 on a £ 18million private jet separate from their scandal - hit bandmates			1

' mr @entity215 , 41 , an electrician , said : ' as parents we are always trying to tell our children that taking drugs is wrong and then you have the band they look up to taking drugs themselves			0
you 're constantly fighting a losing battle			0
' @entity240 , 31 , a teaching assistant from @entity241 , @entity242 , who was taking daughter @entity243 , 13 , and her friend @entity244 , 13 , to the show , said : ' our children look up to the band and by doing what they have done they are telling them it is ok to behave like that			0
when they have such young fans it is worrying			0
they should be showing their fans how to act as children are very influential			0
' @entity256 , 46 , and her daughter @entity257 , 12 , from @entity173 , were also attending the gig			0
mrs @entity256 said : ' my daughter is 12 and she has her own mind so i know she would n't be influenced , but other younger children easily could be			0
if you are that way inclined and do n't have parents telling you what is right and wrong then they think it is cool and could do it themselves			0
' @entity268 , 16 , from @entity269 , who was going to the gig with her friends , said : ' it is a bad example on younger fans but we are older so we know what is right and wrong			0
