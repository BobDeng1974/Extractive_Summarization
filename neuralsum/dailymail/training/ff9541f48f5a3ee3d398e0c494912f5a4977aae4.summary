for singletons , approaching strangers they ’re attracted to in a public space can be nerve - wracking			1
after all , their personalities are a mystery - and they could have criminal tendencies			2
however , a new facial recognition app soon to be available for @entity10 and @entity11 is claiming that it ’s going to make life much easier for those in the dating game who ’ve spotted someone they like while they ’re out and about			2
called @entity19 , it blurs the lines between online and offline dating by allowing smartphone users to simply glance at someone nearby , or take their photo , and instantly see that person 's name , occupation and even visit their @entity30 , @entity31 or @entity32 profiles in real - time			1
@entity55 , the developer of @entity19 , is also creating technology to allow the scanning of profile photos from dating sites such as @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
for added peace of mind , the user can also cross-reference the photos against more than 450,000 entries in the @entity68 and other criminal databases			1
keeping it real : @entity19 takes online dating offline @entity19 's creator @entity41 said : ‘ i believe that this will make online dating and offline social interactions much safer and give us a far better understanding of the people around us			1
‘ it 's much easier to meet interesting new people when we can simply look at someone , see their @entity30 , review their @entity82 page or maybe even see their dating site profile			2
often we were interacting with people blindly or not interacting at all			0
@entity85 can change all that			0
’ @entity19 is currently available on @entity88 testers – meaning that the developer is letting people outside the company examine how it works to help iron out bugs and glitches			1
however , @entity94 will not allow the app to be used for @entity96 beyond this as it contravenes its privacy rules			0
@entity99 , deputy editor of tech mag @entity100 , thinks the app is a good idea , but that users should exercise caution			0
he said : ' it could be very handy if you 're not afraid of scaring people off with your creepy app. it 's evidently pretty clever but i think most people would find it quite invasive			0
and is n't the point of dating to find out more about people ? this kind of defeats the object			0
' in terms of privacy , i assume it 's only finding information that you 've already put online , so it 's not really any more of a risk to privacy than adding photos to @entity30			0

@entity19 allows users to snap strangers and see their social media profiles
it will also cross-reference photos with dating sites *including* @entity62
in addition , users can check photos against various criminal databases
