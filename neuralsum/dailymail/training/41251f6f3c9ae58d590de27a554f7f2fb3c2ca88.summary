by @entity0 published : 15:07 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 15:07 est , 3 september 2013 women who are a healthy weight are more likely to get breast cancer when using hormone replacement therapy , according to a new study women who are a healthy weight are more likely to get breast cancer when using hormone replacement therapy , according to a new study			2
breast cancer has long been associated with the use of hormone replacement therapy ( @entity13 ) during the menopause			0
scientists say this risk is increased among certain groups - including white women with a healthy body mass index ( @entity20 )			0
researchers at the @entity22 analysed 1,642,824 mammograms , which included 9,300 breast cancer cases , from menopausal women			0
data on @entity13 use was analysed by ethnicity , age , @entity20 and breast density for the @entity32 study			0
results showed there was a 20 per cent increased risk of breast cancer associated with @entity13 use among white and @entity38 women , but not black women			1
@entity13 use was more strongly associated with breast cancer risk in women with low or normal @entity20 , but no link was found among those with a high @entity20			1
women with denser breasts also had an increased chance of breast cancer while using @entity13			1
the researchers found a significant relationship between breast density and @entity13 independent of @entity20			0
@entity13 use was not associated with breast cancer for women with high @entity20 and low breast density , whereas @entity13 use was associated with a significantly higher risk of disease for women with low or normal @entity20 and high breast density			1
the researchers say the results show @entity13 may be used for some women without increasing breast cancer risk			2
there is a 20 per cent increased risk of breast cancer associated with @entity13 use among white and @entity38 women , but not black women			1
image shows breast cancer cells lead author dr @entity65 said : ‘ black women , obese women , and women with breast tissue composed largely of fat may benefit from @entity13 use with minimal excess breast cancer risk			1
‘ further studies to confirm these findings and provide more information on other modifiable risk factors for breast cancer in relation to @entity13 use are needed			2
’ dr @entity78 , from the @entity79 and the @entity80 at @entity81 , said : ‘ ultimately , efforts that improve risk stratification , whether made through improved risk models or through measuring valid intermediate biomarkers such as breast density , will inform appropriate use of not only @entity13 , but also other medications , including chemopreventive drugs			0

@entity91 and @entity38 women are at greater risk than black women are
women with dense breasts are also more likely to develop breast cancer
findings *suggest* that some women could take @entity13 without experiencing an increased risk of breast cancer
