by @entity0 @entity1 is rating internet service providers ' video streaming quality on a new website , the latest development in the fight between broadband providers and content companies over who is to blame for slow streaming speeds			1
a link to the website appears when videos on @entity1 's streaming service , @entity14 , are slow to buffer			1
the website quietly launched in may , but recently drew growing publicity			0
@entity1 shows users how their @entity17 is doing - and which one can offer faster speeds @entity1 rates the internet service providers based on how quickly billions of hours of @entity14 videos watched every month load over 30 days and divides those results by provider and location to determine the quality of performance viewers get 90 percent of the time , the company said			1
' there are many factors that influence your video streaming quality , including your choice of @entity17 ( @entity17 )			2
learn how your @entity17 performs and understand your options , ' the website reads			2
@entity1 rates the internet service providers based on how quickly billions of hours of @entity14 videos watched every month load over 30 days and divides those results by provider and location to determine the quality of performance viewers get 90 percent of the time , the company said			1
the website is intended to inform customers who want to view video in high - definition how best to do it , @entity39 , a @entity14 spokesman said			2
' we are just basically providing information , not trying to tell people to change their behavior or do anything different , ' said @entity39			0
customers can compare the performance of various internet service providers in their area through the website			1
@entity1 is not the first content company to send messages directly to consumers about their internet service providers			1
the firm says it wants to warn consumers of the problem in june , @entity58 ( @entity59 ) sent its customers messages that @entity62 ( @entity62 ) and other internet providers were to blame for slow speeds			1
last month , the @entity65 announced it would investigate agreements between internet service providers and content companies to determine whether they are causing slow speeds			1
under the plans for priority usage , @entity58 and other video providers would pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers , and maintain and improve streaming quality and reliability			2
this is being heavily criticised by net neutrality campaigners			0
at the heart of net neutrality is an open internet in which all data being sent from websites to customers is treated the same , regardless of size or destination			0
all this traffic is given the same priority along the same lanes and no site is given preferential treatment			0
although it seems like a fair model , in which sites that use the most bandwith pay the most money , campaigners claim it will drastically impact on industry competition			0
for example , @entity58 has the money to pay for better service , using the fast lanes , while smaller companies do n't			2
this means smaller companies may have the same range of content , but because they ca n't stream at the same quality , they are effectively priced out of the market			0
to address these claims , the new rules include a ' competition test '			0
isps would need to decide if a website meets the critieria to be given priority access and that this bar must be set high enough to protect competition			0
@entity58 has been calling on the @entity65 to do away with fees content companies pay to @entity121 service providers for smooth delivery of their services to consumers			1
the @entity65 is expected to consider that idea as it seeks public comment on recently proposed internet traffic , or ' net neutrality , ' rules that suggest content companies should be allowed to strike ' commercially reasonable ' deals with broadband providers to give priority to their traffic .			0
