@entity0 has described it as the ' toughest decision of my life ' after announcing he will leave @entity5			1
outgoing @entity5 captain @entity0 has ' been a hero to this generation ' and is no less of a player because he never won a league title , according to @entity10 legend @entity9			1
@entity0 announced his decision to leave his boyhood club at the end of the season late on @entity15 following their 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity18			1
the 34 - year - old 's decision ends a glittering 17 - year professional career at @entity21 , in which the midfielder has scored 180 goals in 695 appearances to date			1
despite his impressive list of honours , @entity0 has never won the @entity31 - a fact detractors look to point out when comparing the midfielder to other @entity62 heroes and greats of his generation			1
former @entity5 player and manager @entity9 though , who won 19 major trophies in two separate spells with the @entity10 , believes that notion is a myth because every top player in the history of the game has failed to win something in their careers			1
writing in his column for the @entity78 , the 63 - year - old wrote : ' everybody who has ever played football at the top level has failed to win everything they wanted to win			1
me ? well we could have won three doubles at @entity5 in my time as a player			2
' there ’s always something you feel you have missed out on			0
there ’s always something that people can throw at you			0
you know what that ’s called ? it ’s called sport			0
@entity5 legend @entity9 ( right ) believes @entity0 is a club hero , despite never winning the league ' in time , you come to understand that the most important thing is the trophies you have won			1
you are defined by them , not by the trophies you did n’t win			0
and @entity0 won the @entity40			2
' he lifted his team to the most prestigious title in the game			0
he led the club in that astonishing victory in @entity110 in 2005			0
' at that stadium on the outskirts of the city , he wrote his name even larger in the history of his club			0
' @entity0 kisses the @entity40 trophy after captaining the @entity10 to glory against @entity56 in 2005 @entity0 's achievements for the five - time @entity121 champions undoubtedly make him of one of the greatest - ever players to play for @entity5			1
@entity9 though , who is another to fall into that category , believes that it is impossible to determine if he is the greatest - ever at the club ; due to the fact that it is hard to compare and contrast players from different eras			0
' when @entity132 was in his pomp after the @entity134 , everybody said he was the greatest			0
they called @entity5 ‘ @entity137 ’ in his honour			2
everyone has their favourites and @entity0 has been a hero to this generation , ' he added			0
@entity0 is mobbed by @entity5 fans in @entity110 after guiding them to glory in the @entity40 final			2

@entity5 captain @entity0 will leave at the end of the season
@entity0 announced his decision to leave @entity21 late on @entity15
