by @entity0 and @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 _ @entity4 's football federation is to investigate allegations of match - fixing by its players at the @entity8 after it emerged a convicted fraudster correctly predicted they 'd lose 4 - 0 and have a man sent off against @entity11			1
the governing body ( @entity12 ) released a statement confirming that their ethics committee will probe claims of ' fraud ' by ' seven bad apples ' in the country 's three @entity19 matches , particularly the @entity11 defeat on june 18 in @entity21			1
allegations were made in a @entity24 news magazine @entity23 by convicted match fixer @entity25 from @entity27			1
' we wish to inform the general public that , though not yet contacted by @entity53 in regards to this affair , our administration has already instructed its @entity61 , to further investigate these accusations			0
' we are strongly committed to employ all means necessary to resolve this disruptive matter in the shortest delays			0
' in the meantime we legitimately request that any related information , unless brought before our federation and / or its @entity61 , be held for or treated as mere assumption			0
' we wish to reinstate that in fifty - five ( 55 ) years of existence , @entity12 has never been sanctioned for , involved in , or even linked to match fixing or any fraud of any kind			1
' rout : @entity4 imploded against @entity11 in @entity21 and fell to a 4 - 0 defeat @entity4 and @entity75 midfielder @entity74 was sent off before half - time for elbowing @entity11 's @entity77 , while the game was also marred by an incident deep into the second half as @entity81 looked like he tried to head - butt team - mate @entity82			1
@entity12 subsequently launched an investigation into the incident but have not yet reported the outcome of that investigation			2
@entity4 headed home after losing against @entity89 and @entity90 , as well as @entity11 , to finish bottom of @entity19 @entity92 and @entity93 , who have also exited the tournament , were involved in disputes over money in @entity89 in what has been a troubled @entity8 for @entity37 nations			1
@entity92 sent two players home - @entity101 for hitting out at an official and @entity103 for allegedly swearing at his coach			2
clash : @entity82 and @entity81 needed to be separated after confronting each other seeing red : @entity74 was given his marching orders as the @entity37 side surrendered against @entity11 meanwhile , the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) have challenged allegations of match - fixing made towards the seven @entity4 players			1
@entity110 director @entity114 , also @entity53 ’s former head of security , has questioned @entity25 ’s version of events , revealing his belief that the 49 - year - old has not always proved reliable			1
he added that legal advice has indicated that ‘ there was no observable suspicious betting on this match ’			0
@entity114 said : ‘ if it is confirmed that the advice from @entity126 was made before the match and is accurate to the overall result and red card , then this allegation will no doubt be treated extremely seriously by football , governments and beyond			2
i understand that he has made other ‘ predictions ’ during this competition that have not proved accurate			0
‘ as part of the @entity110 ’s international work in the area of sport integrity and work alongside betting regulators , operators and monitoring agencies , the advice we have received from the legal or so - called ‘ regulated ’ sport betting industry is that there was “ no observable suspicious betting on this match ”			2
‘ looking at recent reports , it is my view that @entity25 is himself playing a game			0
his selective and even the dramatic timing in his exposure of information over time suggests that he has never completely revealed what he knows and which criminal organisations he maintains contact with			0
' at the same time , @entity25 is portrayed as someone who is assisting police and prosecutors in @entity162			0
with the benefit of hindsight , a concerted international and multi-agency debriefing of @entity25 when he was first taken into custody in @entity167 should have been the focus			0
’ however , @entity114 added that the case would be thoroughly investigated : ‘ the @entity4 match - fixing case is a grave allegation with an alleged and strong indication of pre-match knowledge from a well - known match - fixer			1
therefore , in my view , this case should command a swift , strong and , most importantly , an international and coordinated investigation to clear the air in the interest of football and all concerned			0
