by @entity0 @entity1 is the land of the free but not all of its citizens are happy with that			1
a petition has been launched on the @entity8 website calling for @entity9 to leave the @entity1 and rejoin @entity10			1
the application , ‘ @entity12 to @entity10 ’ , was created by ‘ @entity13 ’ of @entity14 , and in under a week it has already received nearly 30,000 signatures			1
neighbours : @entity9 and @entity10 are separated by the @entity17 , just 51 miles wide at its narrowest point we want to be @entity10 : the petition on the @entity8 website asking for @entity9 to be returned to @entity10 @entity9 became the 49th state of the union on january 3 , 1959			1
the strangely worded petition begins ‘ @entity29 russians ( sic ) crossed the @entity30 ( now the @entity17 ) 16 - 10 thousand years ago ’ and continues ‘ @entity10 began to settle on the @entity27 coast , @entity23 inhabited the @entity24			0
governor @entity31 was the first @entity9 on the national ticket of a major party and first @entity35 woman nominated for the vice presidency ‘ first visited @entity9 august 21 , 1732 , members of the team boat " @entity39 » under the surveyor @entity42 and assistant navigator @entity41 during the expedition @entity45 and @entity44 1729 - 1735 years ‘ vote for secession of @entity9 from the @entity1 and joining @entity10 ’			1
the petitioner does not explain how any secession would be effected , whether by referendum or some other means , reports @entity51			0
the @entity8 responds to any petition that receives 100,000 signatures in 30 days and the @entity9 one is running considerably short – the deadline is april 20			1
in 2012 , a similar petition was raised calling for @entity57 to leave the union and it did reach the 100,000 mark			2
a @entity8 spokesman at the time said : ‘ our states remain united			2
our founding fathers established the @entity66 of the @entity1 “ in order to form a more perfect union ” … they did not provide a right to walk away from it			2
’ in any case , following the @entity72 ( 1861 - 1865 ) the @entity71 ruled that unilateral secession is unconstitutional			1
@entity76 view : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity9 @entity9 became a @entity1 territory in 1867 when it was purchased by @entity80 , the secretary of state , at 4am on march 30 after an all - night discussion with @entity10 , a country that was then in financial difficulty			2
it feared losing the territory in a possible conflict and preferred to make some money from its sale			0
the price was $ 7.2m or about 2 ¢ an acre			0
with the purchase of @entity9 , the @entity1 acquired an area twice as large as @entity57			0
initially , the deal was thought to be a mistake and the huge wilderness became known as ‘ @entity94 ’			0
then during the @entity97 gold strike in 1896 it was discovered that the land was rich in resources such as gold , copper , and oil and its proximity to the @entity104 was useful during the @entity105			0
originally the @entity107 , the area became the @entity108 and then @entity109 in may 1912 before being admitted to the union as a state in 1959 .			0

petition has 30 days to reach 100,000 signatures for @entity8 response
@entity71 rules unilateral secession *illegal* since @entity1 @entity72
