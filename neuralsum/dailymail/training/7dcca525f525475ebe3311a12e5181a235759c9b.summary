by @entity0 the @entity2 congressman whose re-election is threatened by a cheating scandal is putting his marriage front and center in the campaign			0
@entity10 @entity9 rep. @entity8 released his first tv ad in the 5th @entity13 race monday , prominently featuring his wife @entity14			1
in the 30 - second spot , @entity8 describes his ' wonderful , @entity17 wife , ' while his wife describes feeling blessed because her husband ' owns up to his mistakes			1
' the pair never talks directly about @entity8 's infidelity in the ad , but it 's the obvious undertone			1
his wife , sitting by his side , adds : ' but a man 's character is based on how many times he gets back up and stands again			0
' in office less than a year , @entity8 's re-election is uncertain after a security video leaked in april showing the father of five kissing a married staffer who was not his wife			1
the staffer resigned after the video surfaced			0
@entity10 leaders called on @entity8 to resign , but he refused			1
seen as vulnerable in his northeast @entity2 - based district , the @entity10 incumbent faces eight challengers on the nov. 4 ballot			0
he 's running without support from his own party , but @entity8 said he 's running because his wife encouraged him to seek re-election			1
he said the campaign ad was his wife 's idea			2
' she wanted me to continue to fight			0
she said , " let 's let the people of the district know that we 're stronger than we were before , and we 're ok " , ' @entity8 said			2
' she 's not some politician 's wife propped up like a stick , smiling in the background			0
she was n't going to be decor			0
and we 're going to move forward as a team			0
' polls suggest @entity8 , from the small town of @entity76 , has a significant shot at making the dec. 6 runoff among the crowded field			0
but he 's lost some of his most well - known supporters from his last campaign			0
@entity84 mayor @entity83 , a @entity85 who supported @entity8 in last year 's runoff , is running against him			1
the bearded men of tv 's ' @entity88 ' who helped draw attention to @entity8 last year have abandoned him for family member and candidate @entity92			1
meanwhile , amid lackluster fundraising , @entity8 's had to pour thousands of his own money into the race , just like he did when he was a political unknown in the 2013 special election that brought him to @entity99			2
@entity8 's campaign says the new tv ad will run around the district , with a $ 75,000 media buy			1
no heartstring left untugged : @entity8 cozies up to one of his five children in the ad -- one likely too young to know why her father is in the spotlight			2

rep. @entity8 was caught on *surveillance* video in april kissing a married female staffer , and was encouraged to resign
he 's running for re-election , and his first tv ad prominently features his ' wonderful , @entity17 wife ' @entity14
the ad never *mentions* his *illicit* *lip* - lock , but does include a *subtle* image of mrs. @entity124 's wedding rings
@entity30 , 33 , was the ' other woman ' and is *reportedly* headed for *divorce*
