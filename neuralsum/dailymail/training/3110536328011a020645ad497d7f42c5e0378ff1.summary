a slimmer who shed eight stone to qualify for an @entity3 breast reduction says she was better off fat after being refused the treatment despite her weightloss			1
@entity8 , 44 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , begged medics to reduce her 44m boobs because they were so big she could barely walk			1
but the 22 - stone mother was told if she wanted to qualify for taxpayer funded surgery she had to lose weight			1
letdown : @entity8 , 44 , shed eight stone to qualify for a life - changing breast reduction but was then refused the treatment as she was : @entity8 begged medics to reduce her 44m boobs because they were so big she could n't even walk however , after shedding 8st 6lb she was told she could n't have the breast reduction after all because her case was n't extreme enough			1
as a result , she says she was better off when she was overweight - as at least she had her large stomach to rest her boobs on , and take the weight off her back			2
the mother - of - two said she now has no body confidence with her size 10 figure and @entity32 chest			1
she said : ' i have no confidence			0
i do n't like showing myself to anyone and i refuse to undress in front of my husband			0
' i should be super confident and proud of my new slim body , but instead i feel horrible			0
diet : at 22 - stone , the mother was told if she wanted to qualify for taxpayer funded surgery she had to lose some weight slimming down : over the next two years @entity8 cut out takeaways and shed 8st 6lb ' my boobs are so big i feel like i am going to topple forwards			1
at least when i was bigger the fat balanced me out and i could actually walk better			0
' but the mother says she struggles most with the abuse she receives from strangers in the street , who shout comments such as , ' you would n't need an anchor to make you sink '			2
she said she feels ' let - down ' by the @entity3 who refuse to help her			2
the full - time mother said : ' the doctor said i had to help myself first , which i have done			0
so why wo n't they give me a breast reduction ? i feel really let down by the @entity3 because i stuck to my side of the bargain			2
' i have saved the tax payer thousands by losing weight through dieting and not asking for a gastric band			0
i 'm not asking the @entity3 for this operation for cosmetic reasons			0
my breasts are ruining my life			0
' @entity8 has suffered with large breasts since she was a schoolgirl			2
she was a @entity75 before her school friends even started wearing bras then shot up to a @entity78 when she became obese			0
her weight increased when she started comfort eating			0
she would consume a burger or sausage with chips every day and regularly ordered takeaway pizzas with a kebab on top			0
after years of debilitating back pain and reduced mobility , @entity8 approached medics about a breast reduction in 2011			1
they told her under strict @entity3 guidelines she would only be entitled to the £ 7,000 procedure if she lost a considerable amount of weight first			1
@entity8 drafted in the support of her overweight husband and two daughters			0
by cutting out the unhealthy foods that had been their staple diet , between the four of them they shed more than 30 stone			1
disappointment : when she went back to doctors they told her she did n't qualify for a breast reduction because her case was n't extreme enough regret : @entity8 now says she was better off when she was fat because at least she had her huge stomach to rest her boobs on - and take the weight off her back but despite dropping 14 dress sizes , @entity8 can still only wear size 26 dresses - which ' drown ' her bottom which is now a size ten - because are breasts are still so large			1
she said she still looks obese despite her hard efforts to lose weight and has to buy specially - made £ 40 bras			1
her large breasts have forced her confidence to plummet so much , she is registered depressed with her gp			0
she also suffers from severe angina and relies on taking strong pain killers , @entity127 , four times a day to manage her back and neck pain			1
and a private consultant @entity130 warned her mammograms are unlikely to pick up cancerous lumps in her breasts as they are too large for the scans to be accurate			0
health repercussions : the private consultant @entity130 warned her mammograms are unlikely to pick up cancerous lumps in her breasts as they are too large for the scans to be accurate a private consultant who saw @entity8 estimated she would lose three stone if she had a breast reduction - taking her weight down to a healthy 10st 7lb			1
however , she 's been told she ca n't have the operation on the @entity3 as her case is n't ' exceptional '			1
an @entity146 spokesman said : ' @entity148 policy , and that of its predecessor body the primary care trust , is clear that breast reduction surgery is not a procedure routinely available on the @entity3			2
' if a patient feels they need this treatment , their clinician would have to make an application to a specialist panel for individual funding demonstrating that there are exceptional clinical circumstances why the patient should receive the treatment outside of the policy			0
' we understand mrs @entity8 ’s case was considered three times by the specialist panel run by the former primary care trust in 2011 and 2012 and it found no clinical evidence that mrs @entity8 ’s case was exceptional			1
' we appreciate this is disappointing for mrs @entity8 , particularly after her recent weight loss , but would like to make it clear a patient ’s weight is not taken into consideration as part of this process			2
' as commissioners , we ensure that local health professionals are informed about the process for applications for treatments such as this , and we are sorry if the policy was not made clear to mrs @entity8 at the time			0
' conservative mp for @entity188 and @entity190 @entity189 is now investigating @entity8 's case .			2
