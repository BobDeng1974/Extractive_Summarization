@entity5 , from @entity6 , has a rare condition known as @entity9 syndrome , which means bright light irritates his eyes so much that he ca n't see anything at all			1
his eyes are so sensitive even the reflective glare of the sun off snow can leave him in agony			1

the 27 - year - old said : ' without his glasses , he ca n't see in bright lights and sunlight , it 's excruciatingly painful for him , he just screams and cries			1
' i hope that within his life time the cure will be made available			2
' @entity23 was born in @entity39 after his grandmother moved there to fulfil her dream of owning a guest house			2
ms @entity43 said : ' when he was five weeks old , i realised that when i spoke to him he would smile but in the wrong direction			0
' i took him to the doctors because i knew something was wrong , but they kept telling me he was fine and they could n't tell whether he could see or not			0
' eventually after numerous tests they told me he could be blind and i was just devastated			0
' i 'd never had any contact with blind people before and i was worried i would n't be able to give him the care he needed			0
' but at the same time , a part of me still believed he was n't blind , i was sure he had vision			0
' @entity17 with @entity23 as a baby : she said she noticed he smiled in the wrong direction from the age of five weeks @entity23 , who is registered blind , loves cars , trucks and trains @entity17 moved back to the @entity64 when @entity23 was 10 months old because she believed he could receive better healthcare			1
she said : ' when we first moved back @entity23 seemed a lot happier , i missed the sunshine , but was much better			0
so we had numerous tests , but nothing was being diagnosed			0
' it was at the age of two when he still was n't walking that i became really concerned			0
' when @entity23 was three years old he was finally diagnosed at @entity74 with @entity9 syndrome			1
the syndrome is a rare genetic condition with which the cerebellum , part of the brain that controls balance and co-ordination , is underdeveloped			1
symptoms include poor sight and problems with movement as well as sensitivity to sunlight and bright lights			2
currently there is no cure , but @entity17 set up her own foundation , @entity92 , last year with the hope of raising enough money to one day cure @entity23 's curse			1
@entity23 with a train set : his mother hopes to raise £ 250,000 to fund research into his rare condition so far she has managed to raise £ 1,500 , but £ 250,000 is needed to fund the three - year research into what is a realistic cure			2
ms @entity43 said : ' @entity23 knows he 's different to other children , but he still does n't fully understand his condition			0
' he 's very popular with the other kids , they love him , so luckily his glasses have n't caused too much of a stir at school			2
' people ask him why he wears sunglasses all the time , i tell him to say they 're his magic glasses to help him see			2
' luckily he thinks his shades are cool			1
' @entity23 is registered blind and has ataxia and kidney cysts that will eventually lead to kidney failure			0
@entity17 said : ' apart from not being able to play sports properly because of his balance , @entity23 's just a typical boy , he loves cars , trucks and trains			1
