by @entity0 @entity1 is known as many things – a city of romance , fine restaurants , epic landmarks and grand architecture			0
but it all comes at a price , boasting some of the most expensive accommodation in the world			0
however , one hotel is hoping to change all that , by allowing holidaymakers to pay what they believe is a reasonable rate for their stay this summer			1
city of high prices : @entity1 is famed for its expensive accommodation @entity21 has launched the enterprising ‘ @entity22 ’ ( ‘ pay what you want ’ ) promotion in a bid to draw extra guests to tour d - @entity28 , his three - star hotel in the central @entity32 district of the city			1
a visitor can pay exactly what they want to stay the night			1
normally , double rooms at the hotel would cost at least € 190 ( £ 150 ) – but should they decide that it is an appropriate amount , visitors can pay as little as € 1 ( 80p )			1
the promotion runs until august 10			0
a leap into the unknown : @entity21 hopes his ' pay what you want ' scheme will be a mould - breaker obviously , mr @entity21 hopes that guests will not pay as small a sum as € 1			1
the point of the scheme , he says , is to give customers a little financial freedom in a city of notoriously high costs			2
‘ if the client wants to pay € 1 , there is nothing i can do , ’ mr @entity21 told @entity57			1
‘ but people will know this is not a good deal			0
we will explain it ’s not fair if they pay one euro			2
’ the experiment will also give the hotel useful information about the sums people are prepared to pay for accommodation as @entity72 struggles back out of recession			1
familiar scenes : @entity1 is known for its landmarks and its restaurants - but rarely as a place for bargain deals he hopes that visitors to the city will treat the scheme as a good deal , but not abuse it			2
‘ we could have run a promotion offering free rooms to the first 15 people to answer a question on our website – but we ’ve decided to do this instead , ’ he explained			0
the scheme has proved sufficiently inspiring that mr @entity21 has had enquiries from other hoteliers in @entity1 – and further afield in @entity94 and @entity95 – as to how it works			0
if the idea takes off , @entity1 may soon be known as the city of great room rates			0
or as the city of bankrupt hoteliers .			0

brave hotelier will let guests pay as little as € 1 per night to stay at his hotel
he hopes *potential* customers will offer a more reasonable amount
hotel is in a prime *location* in the central @entity32 district of the @entity115 capital
